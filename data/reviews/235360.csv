So, if you want to play it, just go play it on a tablet and refuse to pay anything, the game will still be higher version even if you don't spent any money. But, on the moral side, just skip this AND the tablet version and go play the many other nice TD games. I suggest Gemcraft, Defense Grid, Ancient Planet and quite a few others. Don't support Devs like these.","November 21, 2015","false","4.2"," 103 of 112 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","103","112","0","2"

It starts off fun for the first half... You get to upgrade towers and combine powers and unlock new abilities... All very nice...\n\nBUT...\n\nThe baddies are in a constant state of "better than you can ever be" near the middle of the game. As you are upgrading towers, like in other tower defense games it should be EASIER to take out baddies so they just throw more baddies at you so you can then upgrade towers more, but in this game they not only throw more baddies at you but the baddies are near invincible and require HOURS AND HOURS of grinding to finally beat. Even with upgrades and such, the starting "prime" money/resources at the begining of each level is insanely low for the amount of powerful baddies that show up even in the first wave... The amount of prime you get from each kill does not go up with the difficulty increase and health increases the baddies get as the game progresses, so it makes it even harder to upgrade towers and such without pointless hours upon hours of grinding. Also, the types of towers that show up after the midpoint are completely random, so you may get some decent towers in a playthrough or you may never see those towers at all!  It just feels like a poorly executed port from a mobile platform "free to play, but pay to win" type game at that point. I mean I had towers upgraded that could do 5000+ damage in a single shot and it couldn't take down the weakest swarmers.\n\nI really cannot recommend this game because of the insane difficulty curve that spikes in at the midpoint of the game; it goes from being fun, to being a decent challenge, to being an automatic rage quit. Maybe I will revisit the game and give a better review if the devlopers ever fix the balancing issues. (DEVS? If you are reading this, play the game 'Defense Grid" that is how a tower defense game should be done.)","July 13, 2014","false","47.1"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","37","46","0","0"

Very high production values when it comes to visuals and overall presentation.\n\nBut back to the mobile app part -- unlike your typical tower defense game, which focuses on strategy and proper tower placement / usage, this one features a very heavy emphasis on grinding for permanent upgrades to your towers, which makes it almost as much of a hybrid RPG game as a traditional TD one. The game features a booster / upgrade store, and it is this part which feels distinctly like a remnant of a mobile port. As the levels progress, the same types of creeps gain increasing amounts of health, while the strength of your towers remains constant - thus the need to spend substantial amounts of time grinding previous levels for money to buy upgrades. One might imagine that a mobile version of this game would include the ability to buy these upgrades on the spot in exchange for real money...\n\nI'm kind of ambivalent about whether or not to recommend this game. The hybrid TD-RPG concept can work well and be enjoyable, but in this case, I think my problem is mostly with the balance and unnecessarily high grind requirement.","December 24, 2013","false","21.6"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","35","47","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/235360/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","I am slightly conflicted in recommending this. On one hand, purely from a "tower defense" perspective, the gameplay is pretty solid. Everything works as it should and it is well-designed (nice interface, towers all serve specific purposes, enemy health, waves and routes are clearly indicated, etc). And most importantly, the actual gameplay itself is fun. What brings this down are the nonstandard elements the developers tried to introduce into the standard tower defense formula - specifically, the "card system" (and everything that comes along with it). There's nothing wrong with the basic idea - tower types are represented by cards that can be collected and leveled up, and you have to pick and choose a subset of cards from your deck before going into a level. Where the problem comes in is obtaining the cards you need you be successful and "leveling up" those cards. First of all, the leveling system is overly confusing and needlessly complicated. Secondly, in order to beat the later levels, you will need specific cards leveled up to adequate levels of strength. The problem with this is that most of the cards you get as rewards are random, so you could go a good long while without (or possibly even never) finding a Lightning Tower card, for example (which I would consider absolutely essential for beating the game). And even if you are lucky enough to get some good towers, the process of leveling them up takes serious time. You basically just need to keep grinding out optional levels to get extra cards that can be used to fuse/evolve other cards. And make no mistake, you are going to be doing some serious grinding. So, depending on your tolerance for grinding levels and ranking up things, that's how I would recommend you make your decision to buy this or not. Personally, I am the OCD-type who feels the need to level things up and complete stuff, so I forced myself through and eventually got enough cards of high enough strength to power through the main game, as well as the extra hard difficultly that unlocks afterwards. While I did enjoy the game overall, it did take a lot of time and effort to get the most out of it. To me, tower defense shouldn't be about making towers strong enough to win by brute force. It should be about overcoming the challenges using a set of predefined towers and nothing else except whatever strategy you come up with. The first half of this game can be played along those lines, but once you get to the later levels, you will absolutely hit a wall if you don't have certain cards leveled up to a certain strength. That's poor design in my eyes. But even with all that said, I honestly still had fun with this game, as it's well made and I have a semi-high tolerance for grindy things. If you think you can deal with the grinding issue and like TD games, definitely go for it. Otherwise, you may want to hold off or wait for a huge discount.","November 18, 2013","true","71.0"," 39 of 54 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","39","54","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/235360/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","Tower Defense crossed with a Card Collecting game; an unusual mix that strangely works well together. You have a set campaign of around 20 quests to complete before you, with some side quests you can do between main quests to gain further experience. There is some backstory to the whole game but its not overly interesting only appearing after winning certain levels. You use the drops, silver & stars earned from each win to upgrade your towers & magic, increase your deck size & obtain other perks.\n\nInitial levels in the game are very, very easy to complete, making me think this might be a 'one session to complete' kinda game. Once you hit around level 10, the levels get much harder though. If you have been unlucky on the drops or have put your upgrades into tower cards you shouldn't have you can find yourself grinding out upgrades to get through the next level. This isn't overly frustrating though as the maps are randomly selected for each difficultly level & can have random modifiers to block certain tower squares from use. This adds new challenges for existing maps. There are also some unique boss levels where you have a set amount to build & take down a large enemy - those are fun!\n\nThere are a LOT of different towers you can build up in your deck. For tower defense veterans, most of the common suspects are there in some form (guns, flamers, slowers, long range), plus some other more unique configurations. Not sure exactly how many tower types there are but would estimate at least 20. The quality of the card determines how far you can upgrade, with each upgrade generally improving DPS/Range/Efficiency etc.\n\nFor those who like a strong mazing component to their tower defense, then this game might not be for you. There is some maps with a smaller level of mazing but most have a set path design. The strategic importance in PW:D is with your card selection to match the incoming enemies & what you put your limited upgrades earned towards. Better choices will make moving up the levels much easier (unlike my poor effort of a play through lol!), & bad choices will make the game feel next to impossible to beat.\n\nThe HD support (or lack of) I found a bit disappointing. Running PW:D in full screen ends up stretching the desktop down to 1280x720 - windows like the Steam window open in the background always get shrunk down & I need to resize. It looks fine at the lower resolution just a minor frustration. Again, a minor frustation I found was the menus between games. There is a lot of going in and out of different sections to get your upgrades done, check your towers etc. This could have been simplified to fit more cards on one page, and have main functions and browsing together to save going back and forth.\n\nOverall, I have really been enjoying this one. Its a challenging & addictive tower defense game with a card twist! Lots of achievements & one that is well suited to load up for a quick 10-20min TD session.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","April 23, 2014","true","44.5"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/recommended/235360/","xelios","Xelios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/","4978 products in account","Update: Offline mode has been implemented.\n\nPrime World: Defenders is a challenging tower defense with card collecting and rpg elements, where the story is told through comic book art sequences with full voice acting. 23 repeatable story levels, as well as randomized levels for grinding, are laid out on an overworld map. When you play a level you’ll have a rotatable, zoomable and pannable isometric view of towers and enemies. Towers cost “prime” to build and upgrade, and you only begin levels with a small amount. Killing enemies will earn you more prime, as will summoning additional waves of enemies before they’re due--though in many cases this will increase the difficulty and possibly overwhelm you. Where towers can be placed on the field there are sometimes helpful anomalies which increase their range, power or firing rate. There is also a handy toggle for 2x battle speed.\n\nTowers and spells in the game are represented by reusable cards in your inventory, and you can only carry a set number with you into battle. You can see which enemy types populate a map before you enter so you know how to build your deck. There are towers for both land and air enemies, invisibility detection, snaring, poison, fire, mortar and more. Destructible towers which buff or heal the enemy may also exist within levels.\n\nSpells don’t cost prime but are instead on a timer, and consist of targetable AoEs which snare, stun, reveal invisible enemies and/or do flat damage. Spell and tower cards can be combined with other cards in the forge to level them up--increasing their base damage, range and/or secondary effect intensity--and tower cards can be combined with their duplicates to make the towers upgradeable to tier II and tier III during battle, doubling and quadrupling their damage respectively.\n\nCurrency is awarded after battle and can be used to unlock talents for your hero, purchase cards from the store and pay for forging costs. Each story map you complete will earn you 1-3 stars as well, depending on your performance. These stars can be used to unlock high level talents and purchase rare cards. You’ll also be numerically scored on every story map depending on how much damage you take and the amount of prime you have left over at the end, and these scores can be compared with friends’ for each map. You’re also given a total game score which can be compared both globally and with friends’ on the leaderboards.\n\nThe difficulty can be frustrating and requires some grinding before bosses, but it tends to be a gear check rather than a matter of skill. Everything about Prime World: Defenders is surprisingly solid for a title that came out of nowhere, and that’s even considering my time with the game was mostly in its beta state and the fact I am not remotely a fan of tower defense.","June 7, 2013","true","29.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

You have tower and magic cards and you can only select a handful before each level. You can collect new towers and magic by completing levels and/or purchasing them in the shop using in-game currency. If you have two or more of the same tower cards you can combine them to increase the stats which also allows you to upgrade the them in battle. You can also further increase the stats of towers and magic by using any unwanted cards and combining it with the cards you want to upgrade. All of this leads to a somewhat addicting quality of the game of completing levels and collecting tower and magic cards and making them stronger as you play.\n\n+ Variety of different towers, enemies and levels. Typical of any tower defence game, certain towers are more useful in certain situations than others, some towers can only target land while others can only target air etc. Enemies are pretty typical as well, you have groups of easy to kill enemies, slow but hard enemies and everything in-between. Its very well done and strategy is required to make it through the level but if you've played tower defence games before nothing here should surprise you.\n\n+ Upgrading towers and magic is very rewarding\n\n+ Permanent passive upgrades used with in game currency to further increase stats and bonuses\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nThere is a story but it really isn't the main selling point of the game. It certainly doesn't take anything away from the game but it doesn't add anything to it either. You could easily skip the story and nothing of value would be lost.\n\n\nI found the levels to be well done but also very standard. Compared to other tower defence games in the market it seems like a real missed opportunity to try some creative things in each level. I wish the levels got more complex in terms of enemy paths, in most of the levels you have very little control in how the enemies reach the end. In most of the levels, especially in the beginning, everything is pre-determined especially enemy paths and tower placement.\n\nThe game has some bugs but nothing that ruined the game for me\n\nLacks different game modes and options present in other tower defence games\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThis game requires significant grinding in order to advance. If grinding out levels is not your thing then you should avoid this game at all cost. In order to complete some of the more difficult levels you not only need better towers but you also need to level them up. The tower and magic cards you get for completing a level is randomized which means it could be awhile before you finally get the tower card you need to upgrade it. This should not be surprising once you realize there is a free version that has micro transactions to speed up the grinding process. The free version has also received a lot more updates than the steam version.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI've played a lot of tower defence games and I put in a lot of time with this one. Its very well polished but other than its upgrade system it doesn't really provide anything new to the genre. The more I played the game the more I realized just how 'safe' it was in terms of its design. The game is lacking in game modes which hurt it and the game can start getting frustrating when you reach a level that becomes way too hard to complete without grinding. Most people who are not tower defence enthusiast would probably stop playing at this point. If you love the genre than this is a game worth checking out.\n","September 30, 2015","true","43.0"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BikeHelmet/recommended/235360/","BikeHelmet","BikeHelmet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BikeHelmet/","1261 products in account","The metacritic rating for this game is certainly correct. As someone that likes TDs, likes the art style, atmosphere, and music, I have trouble giving it more than a 6/10 simply due to all the gameplay ruining engine glitches. It probably doesn't even deserve that. Without the engine glitches, it might be a 7/10 or 8/10 TD.\n\nThere's a good assortment and variety of towers in PWD - nothing that leaps out as being incredibly unique, but they've got splash poison, single target poison, splash fire, single target fire, AA poison, etc.; what is unfortunate about the tower system is it comes down to luck whether you actually find all the tower cards or not. Even after playing through the entire game, then grinding another hundred levels and buying as many cards as possible in the store... I still did not unlock every tower. Bummer. Aside from that, some towers are slightly unbalanced. If you find some electric tower cards early and max upgrade them, building nothing but those towers and invis detectors is sufficient for beating all but ~3 levels.\n\nI'm skillful enough at TDs that I had no trouble beating the game and collecting all achievements - which brings me to the next problem. The achievements unlock in-game, but some do not unlock on steam. There I am, in-game, and I can clearly see I've got an achievement from beating a level with certain requirements met (like holding onto a large amount of prime energy - used for tower building) - got it in-game, but not on steam. There's an elaborate reset procedure that you can do to give yourself a second chance to unlock such achievements, but if one of the two grindy achievements (win 500 games, build 10000 towers) locks itself down, you'll have no way to unlock them without the help of a tool like Steam Achievements Manager.\n\nIt's quite aggravating staring at a list of 134 achievements, 132 of them legitimately unlocked, and 2 of them frozen. You know that you can get (and deserve to get) the final two, but they are utterly frozen and unresponsive. If you do reset them and start from 0, they will likely freeze again at some point before reaching completion. Therefore, to get them you are forced to "cheat" (Steam Achievements Manager), all because of the company's incredibly shoddy programming.\n\nSpeaking of programming - this game is not epicly high quality like Defense Grid or even Defender Quest. A lot of the time projectiles or magic don't even register. I've landed an 8-wave wall of fire down on groups of enemies, then watched in bafflement as only the final wave caused damage, leading to leaks. For a few of the tougher levels, it can come down to luck on whether the damage you're causing actually registers. About a third of the time invis detectors don't even bother detecting invisible units, so for invis-heavy levels you have to layer quite a few of them all around or once again you may have leaks. (Or just use more electric towers.)\n\nThe game is missing some important hotkeys as well, like a sell button/key to rapidly sell towers. Instead you have to click on a tower, wait for an animation, then click a tiny sell button. It also lacks an 'Auto-Send-Next-Wave' toggle for those that prefer the challenge of waves coming as fast as possible. Instead you're expected to mash the 'Next wave' button, wearing out your keyboard or mouse.\n\nOverall the game might be okay for a novice TD player, which doesn't get annoyed by engine bugs that are sure to ♥♥♥♥ off a veteran - but if you watched TotalBiscut attempt to play it, then you'll realize the difficulty curve is a tad too steep for novices. Quite unfortunate, as that leaves a very small audience that will fully appreciate the game.\n\nThe paper voice acting is also far below the standards of much older TDs like Defense Grid. Overall it left me uncaring about the storyline.\n\n5/10 or 6/10 seem like fair ratings for the game, until they patch some of the engine glitches. But the company does not seem interested in doing so at this time. Every time I see a changelog I get hopeful, but then I check and everything is still just as broken.\n\n-BikeHelmet","March 23, 2014","false","58.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","1"

You unlock towers and spells by progressing through the game, like many other tower defense games, but in order to upgrade those towers you need to get duplicate 'cards' and combine them. You get random cards from beating randomly generated 'grinding' levels and from buying booster packs. You can get common towers easy but the rarer towers (the ones that you really need to perfect some levels) will elude you for a good portion of the game. Eventually you will max out everything and then the game is really enjoyable although easy at that point.\n\nEach level has two challenges that encourage you to play in different ways and after beating the game once you unlock a harder difficulty to really test out your skills (think new game +). The towers and enemies are fairly standard by tower defense...standards but I didn't really have a problem with that. There are boss fights every few levels that require a bit more strategy until you unlock a tower that absolutely shreds bosses to pieces when upgraded. Some kind of infinite survival map would have been a good inclusion, there are 250 wave survival maps when you finish but with a decent enough strategy you can easily beat them with minimal effort.\n\nOverall I'd recommend the game if you don't mind grinding a bit in the early/mid game to get the towers you need to upgrade.","April 23","true","65.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

The towers are not very balanced, but the tiered system allows basically three levels of rarity. The metascore is not a fair score. While there is some grind, that is kinda the point of TD games.

You might think that sounds like a good thing but what is left is a confused and horribly unbalanced game.\n\nI spent my first 8 or 9 hours breezing through the game at a steady pace before hitting a brick wall of challenge which is insurmountable without resorting to endless grinding. Your towers come in the form of cards. You need to collect several of the same cards to upgrade them and progress however the only way of obtaining cards is by finding them at random or by purchasing them with in-game credits. You can't choose which ones you buy with your credits though, that is also left to chance. You'll soon run out of credits though and In a freemium game you would be able to purchase in-game credits to top up if you wanted, in this game however, the only way to earn credits is by grinding. Grinding can often be fun in a game, here it is so ineffective that it feels like an utterly pointless endeavour. You grind away hoping to be rewarded with the cards you need to upgrade and progress yet all the end of level rewards feel about 3 levels behind where you need them to be, meaning the cards you want, the cards you NEED, rarely come up. By the time you've fully upgraded a few towers the game ramps up the difficulty and they are rendered ineffective. You need to upgrade the new towers. Your magic abilities are absolutely useless, the fuse and evolution function is over complicated and there are frankly just too many towers with too many different enemies with the same levels rehashed over and over. It's a mess to be honest and the in-game currency, leveling up system along with the grinding nature of the gameplay and 'daily rewards' and 'special offer's' on items all scream freemium. Yet this isn't a freemium game, so it's all a bit redundant.\n\nAll in all then Prime World Defenders' as a game is basically thus: Want to obtain more towers? Grind. Want to unlock new abilities? Grind. Want to upgrade your towers so you can beat the level and progress? GRIND. Just don't expect grinding to get you anywhere.","June 8, 2015","false","10.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

The difficulty spikes are too steep, requiring you to grind "challenges" (which are really just previous levels) constantly. By the midway point of the game, you are literally spending >90% of your time just grinding. If there wasn't so much grinding, this would be a great game, but would probably only last three hours. As it stands, it's a bad 30 hour game due to the 27 hours of grinding.\n\nOn the upside, the music and graphics are well-done.

Last edited: 27 November.\n\ni will just focus on progression system while for the rest you can read his\n====================================\n\nI have to say that your review is the only one which shares my opinion on the game. Was planing of writing "something" "somewhere" and wanted to inform ppl about it. Basically my opinion is everything you just wrote + one other thing about the progression system. i am not sure how this works so if i am posting on only your wall let me know :)\n\ni do not have a clue if this game is on any other platform but it is clear that the initial design (progression system) was with micro-transactions in mind. During the game you are awarded with "Stars" (level up, optional "quests", random draw, etc.) which you can than exchange for the "rare" booster packs and final tier upgrades (which you will need to do for sure). If they decide to place this game on Facebook/Android/iOS (or something like that) it would perfectly fit in. You even get a free random card for every day you log in (this reminded me of facebook games).\nThere is no microtransactions in the game, just my opionion is that the design the game and progression system was with transactions in mind, then decided not to have micro transactions but they forgot to remove the "grinding" part. Again, just my opinion and how i see it.\n\ni have played for 16 h of the game or so. Had a lot of fun, i quite enjoyed it, got my money worth (was on a discount).\n\nNow i am not sure if i will ever finish it (currently i am aware that i have to grind for a lot of cards/gold so that i can enhance my cards and progress further). I do not have time to grind anymore... probably just getting old :)\n\nMy recommendation:\n- if you are searching for a TD game which you would play every day for 15-20 min than i strongly recommend this game to you (every 5th day you get a rare card so will probably keep your grinding to minimum).\n- if you like to play games in a 1 to 3 h sessions (like me) than the grinding will get quite apparent at some point... now do you want to grind or not its up to you... story could be your motive to grind to find out how it all ends..\n\nin general, if discounted than yes. Full price? No. Add 5 more bucks and buy Defense Grid.","November 27, 2013","false","16.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

If you raised your hand to both of those questions, then there’s no doubt in my mind that you’ll take a liking to “Prime World: Defenders”.  This game reminds me a bit of “BattleForge”, a card collecting real-time strategy game that I was heavily invested in for quite some time.  In this case however, you’ll be collecting cards that will form your tower defense arsenal and be tasked with slaying mutants and baddies by the thousands.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my experience with this game.  I’ve thrown hours into this game and have been showing no signs of slowing down any time soon.  “Prime World: Defenders” is an incredibly addicting game that I’m glad to see has brought something new to the tower defense table.  Yes, it’s a bit grindy…but I’m finding it to be the good kind of grindy.  I also want to praise the game for not including any sort of real money store or microtransaction system, which would be very easy to do in this particular type of game.  Everything purchased in the game is done via coin, which you’ll be earning as you play.  The mission generator (which you’ll see after the first few missions) adds almost unlimited replayability to the game.  My only real complaint (if you could call it one) was that the combat and tower animations were a bit generic.  While pretty, I didn’t feel “wowed” by the towers I placed or the enemies I saw…they just simply served their purpose.  If you’re looking for the bottom line, then I’ll simply say that I highly recommend it, especially for the ten dollar price tag that it currently advertises.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2d2XsBdpOk\n\n","October 13, 2014","true","35.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

A handful of maps become "randomized" with obstacles to change your strategy from play to play, but you will ultimately find a balance of towers to suit your play-style.  The acquisition of cards/towers being the hardest part, involving lots of grinding and luck to get what you need.  The crafting system is poorly explained, but with a little trial and error it can be figured out.  Or look to the forums and guides to tell you the two important things the game doesn't tell you.\n\nWhat killed the game for me is the constant bugs and sudden loss of data.  Towers don't always hit their mark, bonuses are either not correctly applied or explained incorrectly, daily rewards and store offers disappear/reappear randomly, and achievements will stop functioning after a certain level.  This prevents any further progress through Steam's system, though they can still be earned in game.  Not long after losing the ability to gain Steam achievements my data was completely lost with no hope of recovery.  Still not sure how that happened, probably an error on their server regarding saves.\n\nLooking to the forums shows absolutely no further dev interaction, patches, or support.  This is essentially dead software.  If you are hoping for patches or fixes, either the community will have to find a work around, or you're ♥♥♥♥ outta luck.  I bought this on sale for $2.00, and certainly got my money's worth out of it.  Even if I didn't complete it.

Most crucial among those is a progression system that allows you to level up your towers between missions through a collectible card system. You can buy additional cards as well as boosters with ingame currency (no microtransactions whatsoever in the steam version) and use those to evolve your towers, unlocking the ability to upgrade them during missions, or infuse them, making them more effective. Different tower cards also have different rarities, with some being straight upgrades from their common versions. This leads to the first major flaw with the game, as the card rewards for side-missions are random, leaving you hoping for a specific tower to drop because at some point in the game, about 10-12 story missions in, you will hit a brick wall of difficulty. Once you get the next 'tier' of basic towers properly evolved and infused it becomes easier again, but getting these towers is mostly a case of farming sidemissions in hopes that RNG will bless you with the right rewards. I feel the upgrade system worked well inherently, but adding tiers to the towers completely broke it.\nDifficulty tends to be all over the place in general. For example, finishing the normal mode of the game unlocks a heroic mode and two extra long survival missions. But with the towers required to beat the last level I had zero difficulty in the survival missions, often mashing the rush button to send in more gits because my towers ground everything to paste from start to finish. The heroic modes also felt hugely dissapointing, as I was able to blitz all of them with next to no effort up to the last level, which I overcame with two retry's and a bit of tweaking the tower placements.\nThe missions themselves however, are well-built for the most part, with the only hiccup being the randomized levels you get for your sidemissions. The game essentialy re-uses previously finished levels and adds random buffs to some tiles and inpassable rocks to the other. This meant you couldn't rely on a single layout and had to adapt, which greatly increased their replay value. Admittedly it could benefit from removing the first few levels from the map pool, since they're so small you run out of things to build or upgrade halfway through the harder sidemissions and can only sit and cast the odd spell, waiting for the waves to inevitably overrun your defense.\nThe towers themselves start out rather bland with the basic all-round tower, the slow tower and the anti-air tower, but later tiers add some much needed variety, with the highest tier offering some interesting options to mix and match into all new ways to make the Touched's lives impossible.\nThe Touched is the generic enemy faction in this game and consist of a collection of fantasy villains like kobolds, ogres and trolls. The only remarkable enemy is the pink floating marshmallow... thing that occasionally teleports forward and suddenly sneaks past your defenses. No really, you'll know it when you see it... and then you'll rage.\nThe game has a story and a linear set of missions to follow along with that, but it's cringeworthy at best. There's no major twists, even if the game tries very hard to set one up for you. The voice-acting is mostly terrible, with a special place in hell for the short snippets played during the missions.\n\nTLDR: the gameplay is good, but beware that the difficulty can spike wildly between missions and most of the times the only solution is to farm sidemissions.

Sorry to everyone that bought it in the holiday/seasonal sales; it's apparently been broken for months.  I didn't notice until a few days ago.\n\nGameplay wise, the TD mechanics are solid and the card system makes for an interesting twist on figuring out a playstyle that works for you with the cards you have.  There are, however, a few missions along the way that simply cannot be beaten unless you and your cards are leveled up enough.  You simply won't have enough damage to outpace healing, for example, or you won't be able to kill the flyers and the ground units with the resources available unless both sets of towers are strong enough to hit the benchmark of cost efficiency necessary to kill stuff before it gets to the end of the maze.

Despite it being low, the game has it's good moments. At start, I loved the game, I still play it from time to time. The idea of having different towers and magic abilities, which you can customize, is great. Towers and magic are aquired through cards. When it comes to customization, it means you can customize what towers you take with you and you can reinforce these towers with fusing different cards. The crafting isn't hard to grasp, you either improve a card or evolve a card. Evovling meaning, ie. a tower can be upgraded to the next level, meaning you can in-game upgrade the tower. There are 3 tiers when it comes to evolution, default, upgraded and max evolution.\n\nIt is a great game, but playing and progressing requires you to play same map, again and again. At some point through the main story, you will get the next map which you can finish, if you can't you have three different challenges from where you get more cards, easy, medium and hard. These kind becomes your bread and butter, grinding these challenges for more cards, so that you can progress and make better towers.\n\nAt some point, you will notice that there are very little variety to the game. Challenge maps will be recycled, which imo, isn't too bad. But you will see same enemies over and over again, in different colors. The challenge will be different, even though you have the same enemy, but the only difference is that the monster can tank more damage.\n\nIf you don't mind the grinding and similiarites through the game, I would recommend this game. Good game with an good idea, but somewhat poorly designed. I think the metascore is true and correct, but that doesn't mean the game is bad or not fun. I would recommend watching some gameplay vids, before considering buying the game.

Only once (to get a full dragon tower) did it feel like a slog.\n\nAnyways, it's a fun tower defense game.  The story is... well, not great.  The voice acting could use some work, but at least the art direction is pretty good.

Each level has set achievements in place so if you like achievements this is a great game for you to get stuck into. I think it has over 150 achievements though some are bugged which is a shame because it then becomes a completionists nightmare.\n\nGraphically for an indie tower defense game it looks really quite nice. Its clean and aesthetically pleasing though interface options don't have a great deal of options to fiddle around with in terms of graphic settings and such and the main menu is very bare bones,\n\nThe game itself is ok, I enjoy it though there is alot of grinding you have to do to improve towers to progress in levels. As well as getting the max star rating and set goals/achievements, so that can turn some people away.\nTheir is some form of story but its not fleshed out whatsoever so at points because your grinding so much you will forget their even is one.\n\nFrom a tower defense perspective theirs alot of better games (Dungeon Defenders, Fieldrunners 2 and Sanctum 2 to name a few) but Prime World: Defenders is still a better than average game although it just brings nothing new to the genre. Their are coupons which i think take 75% off the price bringing it to around £3.00 so if you can get it for £3-4 its worth it i'd say but overall i'd give it a 6/10.","October 30, 2013","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has exactly the mechanics of DG (I find this a good thing) but the towers and powers are randomized drops and craftable cards, so the levels aren't so much like pre-determined puzzles and there's the thrill of opening booster packs to get a rare tower. I get the feeling that this was going to be a micropayment F2P title, but they scrapped that and switched to a normal price tag closer to launch and made all the stuff accessible with ingame loot. It's interesting to play something that maybe was designed to squeeze you dry and then it actually lets you have all the toys and fun without gouging your wallet.

Involves strategy, but allow different strategies to beat the levels, which is always nice. I hate games where you are given a bunch of options, but to win you have to chose a particular one. Never felt this was one of those games.\n\nYou eventually will have to grind, but i found it an enjoyable grinding never felt repetitive. Mainly because, while "grinding" you can beat one mission you already passed trying new cards/spells you earned. It's like you are grinding but at the same time, you are training and experimenting the best ways to beat the upcoming levels. You get the feel that you are always progressing, which i appreciate a lot.\n\nThe card evolution/fusing system it's also very interesting, and adds a lot to the game.\nThe visuals and voice acting are also enjoyable, not great, but they do their job decently.","August 4, 2013","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pet peave= If you hover your mouse over a tower or even select a tower in game, it does not tell you what tower you have selected or what tower you are about to build.  You pretty much have to learn what tower is what based on the picture or what the tower looks like.  I may be missing something, but I have been playing for a while now and always seem to build the wrong tower.  There are also places where if you place a tower there, you get a buff of some sort.  But there is no indication of what that buff does until you actually place a tower there, making it too late if you make a mistake.\n\nOther than that, the game is amazing!

Yes, to get the "legendary" stuff in this game you must actually play the game!?!? A shocker, I know. To think the devs actually want you to play the game that you just got.    Zzz...\n\nSarcasm aside, this game really is pretty fun. It blends TD, char lvling to gain new skills and also the collecting of cards to gain access to new towers and spells. You then sacrifice extra cards to towers you like to make them stronger. I honestly hope to see more games like this. This game is just as ground breaking to TD as Dungeon Defenders was. The addition of actuall loot in my mind is what makes it shine, but clearly other lazy folks don't agree and just thumbs downed the game without even trying. Granted I've only had it for 1 day but I've logged 10+hours in that time & can't wait till I wake up later to play it some more. As far as the metascore I really am stumped, this is the most fun I've had on a game in awhile and all for under $10.

Addictive gameplay that actually makes you want to play it again and again, with different strategies and scenarios.\n\nPrime World: Defenders has some real balance issues, though. At some point you realize that less than half the available towers and spells are actually worth using and upgrading. When you finish the game you unlock the Heroic mode (same stages with increased difficulty) and the feeling of progress goes down to zero because the stages are insanely hard and grinding does nothing for you anymore. There's also some randomness in your rewards that can screw you really hard if you're unlucky.\n\nRegardless of that I definetely recommend this game for anyone looking for a good tower defense (which is really hard to find). It could use some adjustements but it's fun and addictive in a way few games manage to be.\n\nEDIT: I changed my evaluation to NEGATIVE because the devs are a bunch of greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.

Overall it is a pretty decent tower defense game. You will need to collect cards and upgrade and fuse them for stronger towers and spells. It may give a refreshing twist to the game at first but down the road, the card system seems rather unnecessary and redundant because the towers and spells obsolete and replaced with a stronger upgraded version of it. Cards must be fused with the same kind in order for you to upgrade in-game. Again, this is a waste of effort due to the fact that lower level towers are practically useless.\n\nEach levels spawn 3 optional gameplay for you to grind levels and earn additional cards, stars and coins. All these features are prime example of mindless grinding and in game purchases including the daily log in reward (YES! this game has a daily reward system) which I think is great for mobile play (and YES! again this is a mobile port). If you really loved tower defense game, I would recommend Defense Grid or Kingdom Rush to this.","August 16, 2014","true","17.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes, there is a lot of grinding to do and I am not that far into it, so I am not going to really review the game yet.  Just know that I play a lot of Tower Defense (TD ) games and so far Prime World: Defenders is one of my favorite.  The 3D graphics are superb, the gameplay is fun, but might be a bit grindy for some people, the sound is great with excellent music.  Every thing else is done right and very colorful!  All the menus are pleasing to the eye and the world map is awesome!  The choice of creatures is the best feature and they are all rendered in stunning 3D!!!  The towers and animations look great!  The list goes on and on...\n\nThe only negative thing that I found was that you can only grind the maps so many times before you stop getting silver and experience points for beating them.  Then you have to move along to the next map and grind that map to it's max times.  I think you can grind each map around 10 times or so.  I haven't counted, but it's enough to get some of your perks leveled up.  The cards really only represent the towers and do not come into play during combat like the card game Magic.  You will stack them to level your towers and magic, so to speak.  There are special cards to find and add to your towers too.  This is all done outside of combat.  Combat is your typical tower defense setup, but leveling towers happens outside of combat.  Makes sense and is pretty cool! :-)\n\nThe game is a little hard, but easier than some of the other TD games I've played.  I'll have to play some more and then come back and review it.  I do like it a lot so far.  The game is solid and has not crashed on me yet.\n\nHere are my system specifications: iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8.","June 29, 2014","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As a result, many steam achievements won't unlock (although they do unlock in game, they just have difficulty  syncing up), and this is likely to never be fixed.  End game grinding is a bit tedious, as you're stuck with one of two options to obtain rare towers -- endless survival grinding for a chance at a rare card, and then a chance to pick that card from a set, or logging in every day to get a "daily bonus" which has the possibility of being a rare card.\n\nIt has a lot of card fusing and upgrading, which is kind of a side point to the main game, but it allows you to individually customize your tower set to only upgrade what you use, which is pretty nice.  The unfortunate part of this is the lack of a reliable method to get said towers.  As far as gameplay goes, it's a pretty well done TD, although your ability to path monsters via tower placement is virtually non existant, and your towers are confined to rails along the sides for the most part.  This is it's only real drawback, in that it's more like Kingdom Rush than Defense Grid.\n\nAll in all, decent game, but it unfortunately will never be great with a developer team giving it any post-release attention.  8/10.  Good for probably 40ish hours, with some additional hours if you enjoy the grind to max out your towers.","May 23, 2014","true","106.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vampire337/recommended/235360/","vampire337","Vampire337","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vampire337/","808 products in account","This is a great game in concept, marred by some lack of thought in the execution.  I would still recommend it, doubly so if you see it on sale.  Expect to get frustrated and maybe not play through it all the way, but tower defense games are usually just time-wasters anyway, right?\n\nThis is a solid tower defense game, made unique by the collectible card aspect which allows you to collect your towers as cards, and to upgrade them by sacrificing other cards.  Match two of the same card and you can "evolve" a card, and thus level it up (up to a max of level 3).  Burn a pile of otherwise-useless artifact cards, or some lesser cards that maybe you have too many of, and you can increase the level of your cards, making your towers do more damage and adding range.  The RPG aspects people speak of are pretty minimal, in my opinion.  You, as a character, do gain levels, and this allows you to buy some abilities such as larger card carrying capacity, passive buffs, and more spells/towers to pick from during a battle.  There are spells which, although pretty underpowered particularly in the second half of the game, add some extra bits of strategy when your towers are ALMOST good enough.  The comic-book-esque cutscenes are kindof neat, tho the story isn't exactly going to be the driving force for playing this one.\n\nThe balance is pretty well thought out, with one very glaring flaw.  If you are semi-lucky and get some good rare cards early on, or maybe if you stifle your spending of stars on your stats and instead spend the stars to buy card sets, you can pound through a pretty intense game.  If, however, you don't get at least a lightning or dragon tower by about the third boss, the game becomes impossibly difficult because it's balanced for actually having these top-tier cards.  If you don't have the rare towers, you may find yourself doing a fair amount of grinding, which really starts to suck the fun out of the game.  There are a couple 250-wave levels which are a good means of getting cards and money and experience, but you can't access these until you beat the first half of the game, which really sucks when you just need to build up to beat the last few maps.  They definitely could have put more effort into making the game adapt to the cards they've let you have, rather than assuming you're just going to grind until you get them.\n\nA couple tips for this game: if you can hold off evolving a tower card to level 3, you'll get 5% more powerful towers if you evolve four level 1 cards into two level 2 cards, then evolve those into the level 3.  Takes four of the level 1 cards, which can be tedious to get for the top-tier towers, but that extra punch helps for the second half of the game.  Additionally, to help combat the wunky randomness of buying a set of cards for 3 stars and finding out you wasted your valuable stars, you can go to your %appdata% folder and back up the "Prime World Defenders" folder inside it, and restore it if you get dealt a bad hand.","April 29, 2014","true","94.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Taking all you have learned (and upgraded) back to kick even more backside and finally 3 staring that one level u just couldn't beat.\n\nIt does have a bit of a grindy feel to it but there is always a pay-off for playing maps over again. Even when playing one map multiple time it is always a new enviroment as tower slot get blocked by rocks changing not only routes of monster but also the way you have to set up your defeneces.\n\nThis game is going to be one of the games that will stay installed on my pc long after all the Shooters have be removed to make space for newer and better games.\n\nIf you're wondering should i spend the cash on this game, in a word YES!","February 12, 2014","true","60.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played the game enitirely in off-line mode, so I can't speak to any Steam-related issues or capacities.]\n\nI'm a big-fan of the tower-defense genre, and have been playing them from way back in the Warcraft 3 modding-days, when there were dozens available, and many had very innovative concepts. Prime World: Defenders does a great job at incorporating many different Tower Defence elements into one game, in a way that is mostly smooth and satisfying.\n\nI'll highlight those positive tower-defence elements in this review:\n-Levels are loseable, due to failed strategy, random difficulty changes, or not having leveled up enough. This makes winning more rewarding, and the game more depthful.\n-Many towers are availble in the game, and you get to select up to 7 of them for each battle, making your strategy personal and adaptable.\n-You can use spells in addition to towers to add an extra layer of strategy and the need for awareness.\n-You can "rush" the next wave of enemies for a bonus of money to build your towers. This adds both more strategy, and an ability to get in over your head.\n-There is a leveling up system for your towers and spells, which adds elements of both luck and personalization to your resources.\n-There are a modest variety of monsters, and while I wouldn't mind more, each type has strengths and weaknesses and the balance works well for the game.\n-Ability to replay levels, either for resource farming, or to improve scores/records and secondary objectives.\n-Each time you play a level, the map is generated to have differences in the tiles. A tile could be open, boosted, or blocked. This significantly changes the strategy and difficulty of the level. The type of monsters, and the order of waves also changes/\n\nAlso positive: I find the graphics to be both attractive, and more importantly, clear- I can tell what is going on with the battle at a glance. There is a story, which while not particularly incredible so far, takes place in an imaginative world.\n\n\nThe negatives are as follows:\n-Sometimes you end up having to grind in order to buildup the resources you need to develop your towers and be able to move forward.\n-Maps are reused frequently in the beginning, and while there are changes to both the map tiles and monsters, it grows tiring to keep replaying he same maps if you choose to grind early on.\n-Sometimes the display radius of a tower does not display properly, or does not seem to match up with the tower's ability to hit monsters.\n-The tower and spell-leveling systems are very simple, but poorly explained. I was very confused in the beginning, and there are still some nuances regarding cost that I have not worked out.\n-The "percent efficiency boost" that notifies you what leveling up a tower or spell does is sometimes innaccurate.\n\nOverall I feel this game is a solid investment for fans of the genre. I think it is depthful and strategic, and brings in a lot of nuance and a fair amount of challenge. The downside is that you may spend significant time grinding instead of moving forward, so the game might be a poor choice for people who want to play and beat a game, quick and simple.","December 26, 2013","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Before you know it, you'll be shredding attacking enemies with your own totally unique strategy using your own meticulously upgraded units.\n\nPrime World: Defenders is absolutely fantastic and is completely worth Steam's current asking price of $14.99.

You have more control over which towers you upgrade and how; you have a talent tree, and you have some randomness as to when you might acquire new towers. Throw in randomized levels with the random loot system, and you have a lot of re-playability at various stages of the game - where you might decide to take a break from progression and go hunting for new cards on the side.\n\nAnother thing I find awesome is the music - it's way better than what you usually find on video games, and compliments the gameplay quite well. There's a decent storyline, and the gameplay is rewarding - this game rocks. The only down side is that the makers of the game are no longer standing behind it (no forum activity or work on game) and some minor (but widespread) bugs are still in it. The bugs won't hurt you much though; you can still enjoy a great game at a great price.","December 30, 2013","true","35.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It features character advancement (that is, experience gain and levels), two forms of long term resources to spend (silver and stars) which also help you increase your strength, and tower growth through evolution and fusion.\n\nThe graphics are well done; I generally don't play with sound on so I couldn't tell you much about the sound effects or music.  It's currently in beta but seems extremely polished for that state.\n\nThe only complain I have is that grinding for silver can be tedious at times, but I'm ignoring the very first piece of advice the game gave me, "Don't try for perfect on your first try; you can come back for it when you're stronger."  I can't really hold my personal failings against the game. :)","May 5, 2013","true","48.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is an absolute gem for Tower Defense lovers everywhere, but may as well appeal to a broader fanbase in that it has a trading card style mechanic to it. Parts of the game especially after the first few missions can seem kind of grindy at first, but doing missions over and over and collecting different cards and upgrading your towers and spells is what keeps me hooked on the game for hours. I have always enjoyed games where you have to slow down and power yourself up. Keeping you from running through the game altogether. There isnt a vast amount of maps but the replayability is insanely high. Really enjoy the game, the metacritic score is very innacurate. Dont believe me? do yourself a favor and check the user reviews and play the demo! I very well would have paid the 9.99 for the game but the Autumn sales price at 3.40 as of now should be an instant purchase for many!

It contain's many features: You can pick your preferred Towers for each level, you can level up as you are making progress, you are granted rewards by completing levels and different achievements (Silver and Stars) with which you can spend it on talents making it easier and funnier to play. You can forge your towers: Even your towers can level up with more efficiency. There is a huge arsenal available to you but also your opponents have their different units aswell. With magic you can fight too, level them up and kick a s s.\n\nPro's:\n- Pick up your towers for each level\n- Level up and upgrade your towers/magics or sell them\n- Many types of opposide units\n- Gambling on treasures\n\nCon's:\n- Short story, somewhat short game\n- Will become boring after 1/2 of the playtime since you have to GRIND MUCH sometimes items and artifacts to get your towers strong enough to survive. Especially at the end of the game you have to GRIND over again and again and again to beat the game: This is a bloody waste!\n- Since you will encounter some difficult or tricky enemy types you are left with a mini choice of your favourite towers. This means you HAVE to pick up often utility towers to replace your towers or leave you with lesser choices and fun (except you like challanges).\n\nThat's pretty much about it!
