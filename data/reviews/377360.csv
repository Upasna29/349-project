"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jimykx/recommended/377360/","jimykx","jimykx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jimykx/","207 products in account","PROS:\n-Very fun and creative game, specially if you can play with friends (locally or online)\n-It has a lot of fun ideas and inovative features\n-You can play with your own Custom created character\n-You can create your own custom background scenery\n-The Character/background creation process is fairly simple.\n-Improves your attention and typing speed for sure!\n\nCONS:\n-Takes too long and too much effort to restart a battle when it should be much faster. If you keep losing against a NPC/player it will become frustrating since you spend more time going through the menus and animations to get to the fight again instead of actualy playing.\n-Biggest problem I had with the game is how it is built around using a controller (I dont have any).\nIt is NOT optimized at all for the use of mouse+keyboard, besides the fact that you can use your keyboard to play instead of the controller. Though you can't use it to type or use the mouse at all.\n\nAs a conclusion Its definitely worth the price. In this market of unfinished and crappy games that are ridiculously expensive, Western press is and clearly feels like a complete game with enough features, stability and solid gameplay that make the default price feel like it's a game in permanent discount.","April 22","true","3.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sherlock_van_helsing/recommended/377360/","sherlock_van_helsing","Sherlock Van Helsing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sherlock_van_helsing/","638 products in account","https://youtu.be/JgWVlwjxaA8\nGame: Western Press\nGenre: Western 1v1 Duel\nDeveloper: Bandit-1\nPublisher: Surprise Attack\nCopy supplied by PCGN\n\nWestern Press is a 1v1 western dueling game developed by Bandit-1 and published by Surprise Attack. As a big fan of the western genre, I was really hyped for the release of this game, and I am happy to say that it succeeded my expectations.\n\nSTORYThe cutscene that opens the game parodies Sam Elliot's opening monologue of The Big Lebowski, and it immediately sets the tone of the game: a fun, not serious parody of the Old West. While there isn't a Story Mode, there are plenty of characters and references: Wyatt Earp from Tombstone, Ellen from The Quick and the Dead, Mattie from True Grit and many more.\n\nGRAPHICSThe pixelated art style is oozing with charisma: from the character animations to the backgrounds, everything is rich of details. The animations of the characters are fluid and the colors are vibrant, perfectly capturing the beauty and madness of the Far West.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game can both be played with bots, locally or online. I played the game using a controller, since the keyboard control aren't polished right now, but the developers are working to fix this.\nThe gameplay is very single: each of the two players has a string of 10 buttons that they have to press in the correct order as fast as possible with little to no mistakes, and the first to finish gets to shoot the other duelist. This is a very simple mechanic that is incredibily easy to understand but very hard to master, especially when playing online.\nRight now you can only play three game modes: Skill Tester, Custom Tournament and Online. In Skill Tester you play against nine bots with increasing difficulty to make you get a grip of the game mechanics. In Custom Tournament you can play with up to 16 players locally (or with bots) in a tournament that is very great for when you are having a party. In Online you can duel with other players.\nIn Custom Tournament you can also play Memory, which is basically an increasing amount of button prompts that you have to remember. The player who remembers all of them or that makes the least amount of mistakes wins. This game mode was very damn fun, especially when you get to 9 or more buttons to remember.\n\nCHALLENGEThe AI is very easy to beat in the standard mode, unless you are playing against the Very Hard bot: he presses every button extremely fast, and he won't make a single mistake, so if you want a good challenge offline I recommend playing with him. Also, playing Memory against the AI is just too weird, and I recommend having a human player to play it with.\n\nSOUNDThe soundtrack is amongst the best of western video games, bringing you back in time, making you feel nostalgic and never feeling derivative. The voice acting of the narrator is a spot-on Sam Elliot impersonator, and the sound effects of the guns are great.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThere is plenty of replayability here: beating Skill Tester is not an easy task, and if you have friends that come over you can play four or five rounds in about two or three minutes total. There are also 25 Steam achievements to unlock, and, with the addition of Steam Workshop support, more duelists to play with and more stages to battle on.\n\nOverall, Western Press is an excellent party game that works very well as a single player experience. For its very cheap price of 5$ I highly recommend this game to pretty much everyone. Being their first game, the guys at Bandit-1 have a long road ahead...\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 9\nGameplay: 9\nChallenge: 8\nSound: 9\nReplayability: 9\n\nENJOYMENT: 9\nFRUSTRATION: 6\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","May 2","true","4.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

What I found after loading the game up for the first time was a delightfully polished western atmosphere with a wonderfully narrated and cinematically designed introduction that really sets the scene and mood of the game.  While the core gameplay works pretty well and all the production aspects are quite tight, the brilliance of the atmosphere has left me wishing there were more modes than just multiplayer/tournament and a single character "skill test" linear playthrough.  If the devs continue building on this world and adding more modes like a full training mode, career mode, individual character story modes, or some sort of quest/rpg mode it would make for an absolutely incredible experience.","April 27","true","3.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/377360/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Western Press is Bandit-1’s first ever game on Steam while it is publisher Surprise Attack’s tenth. This time around they’ve delivered one of the most ingenious games that I have played this year in a gun toting wild west game that will be all over in a matter of seconds. The concept isn’t new it’s the delivery that is. Players – and you can play as a single player against a competitive AI –  aim to beat a row of controller presses as quickly as possible. It’s a wild west shoot out as the quickest to ‘draw’ is the winner just as it was back in the days of the wild west partner.\n\nThere’s not a whole lot to the game – the above is what you do – but the presentation makes the game addictive. The presentation with the setting is what makes the game. If you’ve ever wanted to know what it’s like to virtually have a quick draw at high noon then this is your opportunity. The game quickly becomes addictive – even playing against the AI – and you will find yourself playing round after round given that they are so short (less than five seconds and highly likely under three when or if you become proficient enough at the game). I appreciated the art work and the overall narration. I thought that they were terrific additions to the game and key components in what makes the game addictive. The characters have great senses of humor.\n\nThe game is newbie friendly but as great games are it is insanely difficult to master. I have yet to complete the skills challenges (the player Vs AI part of the game) because it just gets too darn quick for my reflexes which I thought were fine. I get to the 2.5 second level and that’s about the best that I can muster. I’d really love to see gameplay videos of the very best players. I think it would be insane. The way that the game has been designed leaves it very open for tournaments – which is, in fact, a primary multiplayer component of the game.\n\nI have yet to play using keyboard controls but I’ve seen reports that they need to be tweaked a little bit. I believe that the game was clearly made to be played with a controller as those controls are fantastic. This might impact your play if you don’t have any controllers.\n\nThe game has been Steamified with trading cards and achievements. There is cross-platform support for the game which should enrich the multiplayer experience.\n\nI loved my time with Western Press and look forward to arranging a local multiplayer tournament for the game soon.","May 2","true","12.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Anyone can just pick it up and play it.\nThere are some neat unlockable characters, good humour, and the sound and animations are great.\n\n\nThe game features keyboard, controller, and Dance mat support.\nIt has 2 game modes, one about pressing the right buttons fastest, and one about pressing buttons off memory. You can cheat in the memory mode quite easily however via obvious means; since it gives you so much time- but if you play local that wouldn't be a problem.\n\n\nThat being said I have had some of the following issues so far:\n-De-sync in a few online matches. Like I kill them on my screen, but on their screen they killed me.\n-I can't seem to change characters or anything unless I quit the online game and re-host the whole session.\n-The native's bow makes a gunshot effect/sound for some reason, maybe that was left in intentionally? I dunno.\n\nIn summary it's a very simple game at a low price point that is worth checking out.","April 21","true","1.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
