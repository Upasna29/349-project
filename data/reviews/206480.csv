Not the beta for F2P either, we're talking 2005. I only downloaded it on steam because I discovered I could multi-box that way but 99% of my hours playing this game are not on steam. Yes, this reminds me I need a life bad because I realized I have 440 steam hours as well at this time.\n\nFirst I must say I have a bitter love/hate relationship with DDO. I am a huge PnP D&D fan and have been since I was a kid. The quests in DDO are second to none. The way it blends classes and makes rogues feel like a real class is simply amazing and gameplay is simply fun. To date it's one of the best combat systems I've ever used and I have played a LOT of MMO's. Since it's not heavy PvP it's one of the games you can max the graphic settings out and realize it was designed very nicely and not be gimped. I have level capped so many characters and honestly if you know how to build a character in real D&D you'll have a huge advantage over other players. I've never had a character I felt was anything less than spectacular and have always felt emerged in my characters. Though I feel strongly about all my characters, the artificer (one of the semi-newer classes) has really created one I enjoy. As I said, I've got a love hate relationship with this game and even though as of now I no longer really play the game, this was my favorite game of all time and I regret the actions of turbine that made me decide to leave.\n\nNow, on to the reason why I don't recommend this game anymore. Also why after bringing everyone I know and game with to DDO, they all left too. I'll spare you the trial and error details as this game has been forced to change and evolve. Despite many of those changes coming too late after they've lost tens, maybe even hundreds of thousands of players. All of these changes were not enough to drive me away (for good anyway). Many people left because of things that were later fixed like the lack of ability to solo or lack of content. Issues I don't find so much in the current game if you're a subscriber, but that's where it ends and the problem begins.\n\nTurbine has apparently gotten VERY greedy. As they've become short staffed, under budget, and now owned by big brother warner they've gotten outright insane with their cash shop and try to leech every player for everything they can. I'll start on this with their subscription plan. Lets just say if you don't have this they will punish you. You're availability of content will start off good up to level 6 and by level 15 become almost unplayable. I always subscribed for this reason but even as a subscriber you're punished because you lose all the F2P players to group with and run the paid content. They have "guest passes" but seriously, how long will you go paying peoples way into groups with your wallet before that gets old? (answer, not long). Beyond content you're also unable to open dungeons at higher than normal difficulty until you've completed the lower ones. This wouldn't be so bad except the bonuses for "Bravery streaks" (playing content first time on elite @ level) are huge and you miss soooo much experience not being able to do it. When you suffer from the lack of content F2P players have losing 50% of your potential experience just doesn't feel right.\n\nNow even this is not enough to push me away. So I kept playing and yes in time I will admit I dumped thousands into the cash shop. Yes, thousands of dollars and no, not paying to win because those options came later. We're talking buying buffs for my guild ship, buying guest passes, buying friends and family content to run with me, buying expansions, buying character classes, unlocking storage, character slots, and so on.\n\nYes, that's right, even if you are a subscriber, you still have to pay for access to expansion content. You still have to buy certain character classes and so much other stuff it'll drive you insane. Yeah, you can live without it but you will feel the pressures of not having it. For example, F2P players don't get shared account storage. This game has tons of "Bound to Account" gear that you can pass to other characters on your account, but only through that storage.\n\nThis was not enough to deter me, so I gamed on! Emptying my wallet into a game that got MUCH more expensive after it went free to play, I still loved DDO and couldn't stop playing. Then they added the hard core cash shop content. Books that add perma experience boosts per character, supreme stat tomes that don't exist in game and getting them the hard way would be a fortune and take forever, and eventually, the ability to buy levels. Yes, that's right, you can "buy" levels.\n\nIt started with "vet status" to start at level 4 instead of 1. Then the new vet status lets you start at 7. However you take these level boosts on an airship and you can access the cash shop before taking them. You can buy all the cash shop exp buffs and instead of starting at level 7, you end up over level 8. This becomes a big deal because there is a cash shop item a level 8 character can use that makes them level 16 and gives them gear! Now, you can buff up hard, cash shop some more and instead of 16, end up level 18+ well on your way to 19 (maybe even with new stuff end up 19?). So for a game where you true reincarnate at level 20, you can start the game around level 19!? Talk about Pay to Win? I spent years leveling my characters now people can start off almost ready for TR? Regular levels cap at 20 before you hit epic levels that only go to 28. Which by the way you can't ever see without paying. Not only do F2P players not get access to the epic destiny feature, but there's almost no free to play epic content.\n\nBy the way, even this wasn't enough and I played on! Figured it would at least bring some noob high level players to run content with (it didn't). Then the game killer for me came. After tolerating my favorite game becoming pay to win, they drew the last straw for me. DDO has had astral diamonds (cash shop currency for in game purchases) for years. You use them often for ship upgrades for your guild. There are few other things they could be used for, but nothing game killing. Then they did it, they added "astral shards". Astral shards, much like diamonds are cash shop currency. However they are everywhere. Need a buff? You can buy one. Want free stuff? Toss dice rolls for free stuff with it like craps. You name it and it has astral shards now and the big winner... the astral shard auction house! (seriously, wth!?).\n\nNow games like Diablo 3 (which blows hard) have a real money auction house, so what's so bad about this? Well, in diablo 3 big brother Blizzard takes a cut, then gives the money to the seller which you can then do what you want with. With astral shards, your real money auction house only makes them money. They take a shard cut from your sales, give you the change, you use it to pay for in game micro transactions (different and in addition to cash shop).\n\nSo Turbine wants you to subscribe for $15/month (I paid $99/year as better deal).\nPay for new content even though subscribers are supposed to get it as part of their deal.\nThen drop buckets in the cash shop.\nAnd now buy astral shards to pay for everything in game with micro transactions including the auction house.\n(yes, it has made platinum almost worthless)\nIn game point rewards too small to do much with. You can buy very little.\n\nI'm sorry to my beloved DDO.\nI still visit from time to time, but I cannot play this game anymore.\nI decided originally as punishment for their greed, Turbine could not have any more of my money.\nNow I see a fraction of what F2P players see.\nAs free to play, the game is not worth it.\nSadly, this is the most expensive F2P game I've ever played.\n\nAlthough if you're a true D&D fan and have buckets of money to spend and not care.\nThis otherwise would be an amazing game second to none.","January 22, 2014","false","451.2"," 957 of 1,074 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","957","1","7","72"

However, it has started using questionable practices as  a business. For a while I decided to simply not purchase anything in game and hoped that those in charge would get the message as fewer people used their software. However, recently, an update installed that broke the camel's back. Software known as Akamai netcient or some such tried to force install itself onto my computer when I tried to use the client. It was caught by my compter's security thankfully and was blocked. Upon looking further it sends bandwidth and your computer data in a peer to peer network. This is HIGHLY questionable and furthermore a major breach to your computer's security. They have recently stopped using Akamai netclient though I still do not like how they choose  to gouge customers for money since they literally cannot find any quests after about level 10 since they require you to buy access to the content. However, if you go for a subscription then it is likely a fun game, though only if you wish to use a subscription plan and get access to all the features and zones.\n\nJust checked it again.

Do you want a truly engaging MMORPG that lets you control all aspects of your character? If so, look no further than Dungeons & Dragons Online (or DDO for short).\n\nDDO is a free-to-play MMORPG that plays like no other. First off, there’s plenty of content to let you see what this game has to offer available for free, so you don’t need to grab your wallet just yet. You may notice that there are only a few classes available for you to play for free. However, none of the classes are inherently linear and you can tweak each one to your liking. Want to hack enemies to death with blades and still cast spells? No problem. Want to play a fighter that can disarm traps? A little trickier, but possible. Now, some builds are harder to execute than others, some either being impossible or require paid content to execute effectively. However, as long as you're not going for a super-exotic character build, you won’t be disappointed. The game recommends that custom characters only be used by advanced players, but I highly recommend doing it, even if it’s only your first playing because getting to build your own character makes the whole experience much more enjoyable. As long as you are at least somewhat familiar with RPGs, you’ll be able to follow the character creation instructions just fine. (even if you mess up your character a few times) Plus, there are plenty of great guides available, including a few here on steam, to help you if you are confused. It should be noted that this game, while based on Dungeons & Dragons 3.5, isn’t like any edition of D&D. The game plays very differently from its pen and paper predecessor, which may confuse and frustrate those who are familiar with it. Regardless, it works well on its own. One thing that should be noted about the deep character customization is that if you don’t enjoy character building and spending time planning out what kind of character you want to make you may not be able to enjoy the game to it’s fullest. Just a fair warning.\n\nThe overall gameplay is similar to most other MMORPGs out there. 1.) Get quests 2.) Kill/Loot 3.) Get XP. However, the way it is executed in DDO is very different. Each quest in is it’s own private instance, taking place in a unique location where the only people you interact with are those in your party, you only see every player in public areas. This gives the game a greater sense of adventure, even if you aren’t all that interested in the story. Also, unlike other MMOs, your health/spell points don’t regenerate, making it so you must manage your resources carefully, making the game much more engaging. Rather than target an enemy and spamming skills, you actually get to fight them as you would a regular Action-RPG. This really helps shrug off that icky MMOish feel that people like me have grown tired of, and really immerse you into the game. You level up much more slowly in this game than most RPGs. However, I can assure you that as long as you're enjoying your character build, this won’t be a problem as every level up gets you a lot more here than it would in another MMO, and you don’t need to farm the same quests over and over to get a good ammount of XP.\n\nUnfortunately, with all the greatness that DDO is, it suffers from quite a plethora of issues. The first chunk of quests are all very enjoyable to play but once you get to the later quests you start encountering cheap ways to die. Traps become extremely cheap and deadly, even if you have a trapper, they can still sneak up on you and end you instantly if you’re not careful. This is almost always true on elite difficulty. Also, having good armor class is helpful early game, but later on spells are what really become dangerous and most enemies will still hit you almost every time, high armor class or not. Making fighting classes have a lower level of solo ability late game, and just less practicality overall. Also, there is a lot of paid content once you get out of the opening area. I can say that the content is worth paying for a subscription and by the time you get to a point where you need to pay for a subscription to continue enjoying the game you will have played enough to know whether or not it is worth it to you.\n\nHowever, the real problem lately is the lag, I don’t know what’s happening lately, but the game is getting more and more laggy, and seems to only be getting worse. The past few days alone I’ve experienced lag that has made me want to smash my keyboard and monitor because the game becomes literally unplayable. I remember having this game run smooth as butter several years ago, then watch it slowly get more and more unstable over the years until it finally has become a serious issue. Perhaps it is merely my system that is the problem but I know several other players have been having issues lately. This is backed by the launch screen that is rather...strange. With each download the overall progress always reads 88%, even if it’s nowhere near finished. Also the game will take a very long time to download all the update data, even after you finish downloading the game. It gets the job done, but they way it look always makes me worried that it’s not functioning as it should. I will Admit that all of these issues may be just me, however have heard that the current dev team behind the new DDO updates don’t fully understand the programming of the previous dev team, leading to quite a few technical issues. Hopefully you have a better experience.\n\nBut after all those issues, one more thing that stands out in this game is the community. In an internet where people get incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and rage debate their irrational viewpoints over the most trivial issues, DDO has a shockingly high ratio of kind, understanding players. Time and time again I have joined random parties and time and time again everyone cooperates to get the job done. There are some toxic players out there, but they’re few and far between.\n\nAll in all DDO is very unique MMO with extensive class building and filled with immersive adventures. It suffers late game with cheap attacks/traps and paid content but they still don’t ruin the experience. The only reason I couldn’t completely recommend this game is that the technical issues it’s been having lately can make the game completely unplayable. Perhaps later on this will be fixed but for now it’s the only real flaw the game has. But if you’re lucky you may not even experience the issue. This game is enjoyable solo and is a blast with friends. I strongly encourage you to play it, dabble in a few classes and builds, then if you like it, invite your friends to play and go crazy. If you don’t enjoy it, at least no money was lost.\n\nPros:\n+ Has very deep character customization, especially for an MMO\n+ Each adventure feels unique and immersive\n+ No skill spamming found here, features true Action-RPG gameplay\n+ Has one of the nicest player community you could find in any MMO\n+ Did I mention unique character building?\n\nCons:\n- Graphics are outdated and a few of the voiceovers are very low-quality, shouldn’t be too big of an issue if you enjoy the gameplay\n- Game gets cheap and you may die out of nowhere by a cheap spell or trap\n- Lag has been heavy lately, along with other technical issues it could make the game unplayable if you're unlucky. (Hopefully this gets fixed)\n- May find the game unenjoyable if you don’t like character building (and more importantly re-building)\n- PvP isn't great since not all classes are combat-optimized","August 2, 2015","true","52.4"," 80 of 93 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","80","93","6","0"

But i read it to late. I've seen the sparkling chest nestled enticingly in an alcolve directly opposite our position and i rush towards it. Stupid. The floor collapses and i fall into the misty chamber below. There are bones strewn around the room and then suddenly an elite level scorpian erupts from the ground and immediately attacks me. The rest of my group - my guild mates - leap heroically into the chamber and we engage the beast together and manage to bring it down. "we can't get that chest now, there is no way back up", says the same Cleric. "sorry" i say, and imagine my character, head hung in shame, shuffling his feet. "no problem :)" says the Cleric. My Ranger searches the room and finds the lever that opens the chamber. A gloomy tunnel stretches into the distance. We heal up then move on.\n\nThis is what D&D Online is all about and when it is at its best. The game has a number of large open hub areas but the missions will almost certainly lead you underground into a dark cavern or muggy sewer. In the hubs you can find group members, hire mercernary's, prurchase healing scrolls and potions, and upgrade gear and equipment, before venturing into the dangers below. Some quests ask you to clear out an infestation of spiders/kobolds/etc, normlly with  larger, more dangerous boss type near the end, whilst others may ask you to rescue a merchant's daughter or find a precious artifact. Throughout these dungeons there is the possibility of finding rare monsters with epic loot, normally only found by finding a hidden door or secret area, but only if you or one of your group has the riht skills. This is a game that rewards exploration, that encourages group play, and grabs wholeheartdly at that inner fantasy nerd that exists in so many of us.\n\nAs a solo experience this is a lesser game. You can clear same level content no problem, even an elite dungeon or two with the right equipment and merc's, but the exprience feels lonely and more shallow on your own.\n\nThe game truely shines as a multiplayer experience, which, to be fair, is exactly how the game is intended to be.\n\nI can over look the aged graphics and tired engine for the wonderful frill of descending into the deaths of an undead crypt with a group of likeminded advnturers. Most stuff is decided on invisible dice rolls and armor/will saves just like (almost) the tabletop game, but the combat has a degree of twitch and you can dodge incoming attacks with a well timed double tap. When you find a loot chest automtic rolls take place and loot is devidied up accordingly but you can transfer items to another group member if you want to.\n\nThe community is very friendly and I was soon in a really helpful high level guild (this brings loads of perks to experience gains and buffs) and there nevr seems to be shortage of people to go questing with.\n\nMuch like LOTRO the whole game is F2P with the need to buy quest packs for additonal content or unlocks for certain race/class types. It is fair to say that you will likely need to pnd a few quid t some point to advance th whole experience but the good thing is this can be done at your leisure and if you done wan to then, well, dont.\n\nI for one applaud this style of F2P model and for  a game that provides this much AAA fun I had not issue with spending money on it - i just purchased all of the DLC for just over £14 in the sale and thats good value by any standard.\n\nIf you like D&D, fantasy, and group style play then i can highly recommend this game. If you don't or are looking for another WOW style experience then keep looking. D&D online isnt trying to be WOW or Guildwars and I am glad of that.\n\nAs an fantasy adventure maker this game is top notch and you should certainly give it a whirl - 8.8/10","November 30, 2014","true","50.2"," 56 of 63 people (89%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","89","56","63","14","1"

I played it quiet a long time approximately 1000+ hours. We started with bunch of friends for fun but then all of a sudden it became serious we were addicted this game was amazing, we cleared lots of dungeons had the best items, paid for some expansions. After a long time i started to play it again and with a fresh ideas. My review is short and simple as always.\n\nPROs:\n-Gameplay is amazing.\n-Dungeons are really detailed and great.\n-Leveling system and classes are different than usual but its better in most ways.\n-Quests are good and not boring.\n-You can create really good Builds with a fantastic skill tree system\n-It's a game to play with a group friends. (for me the solo is a little boring) not just for fun because in lots of dungeons you need different classes and roles to have the most of it.\n\nCONs\n-The graphic are getting old and decent for our time.\n-There is a lot of, i mean A LOT OF, "paid" content like expansions, character slots, classes, races... goes on.\n-It's not a free world there is only cities , towns to roam, shop etc. and dungeons (instances) for some action.\n-Not too much players: Population is really low.\n-The game is dying and perhaps nearly dead.\n\nIt's a wholla lotta different gamplay experience. I recommend this game. I love this game. it has a different place for me. I suggest you to play it (if possible play it with some friends), experience it, than its all your decision to like it or not.\n\nHave Fun!","June 9, 2015","true","17.7"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","43","51","0","0"

The time displayed doesn't nearly reflect the time I've spent on this game, just add a good ~3,000 hours and it might be right.\n\n\nI like it in spite of the following:\n\n- There are still bugs in the game, that have been known for years. (After seven years, there was a kind of unofficial celebration of the infamous "ladder bug" on the forums. I think I'd be sad if they fixed it someday.)\n\n- The new shard exchange (read: we want your real money) dealt the death blow to the ingame currency.\n\n- The player base has been eroding for years now and new players a rare sight.\n\n- If you can't find a group / guild to join, you'll have a hard time (read: die a lot) as a new player.\n\n- If you have never before played D&D, you will ♥♥♥♥ up on character creation the first time around. And the second time and the third time,... can you notice a pattern?\n\n- If you have played D&D before, you will ♥♥♥♥ up on character creation, the first time around. And then the second and third time... but you will notice your mistakes earlier.\n\n- There are tons of low to mid-level quests but hardly any F2P-quests in endgame.\n\n- No, sadly it's not really like pen and paper D&D. Then again, I can't imagine how to make that fly as an MMORPG.\n\n(- How to put this gently: Some people will instantly hate DDO upon reading this paragraph. Why? There is no PvP to speak of. PvP only exist if you want to participate, but it's useless. DDO's character classes are based on the pen and paper version of D&D 3.5. Meaning, the classes are supposed to support each other in combat against enemies, not against each other. No matter how often you throw your virtuoso-skilled Bard against my Wizard, you're toast. If you want PvP and can't have fun in a game without bushwhacking other players' characters, go somewhere else.)\n\n\nI like DDO because of the following:\n\n- In fact I like this game so much, I've even started to like it's bugs and there are plenty of those. Some are frustrating while others are hilarious and none of them game breaking. Yep, that's a  pro  for me.\n- Nice crafting system - or more precisely - systems, as there are roughly ten diffferent crafting systems around. If you've got enough time or money or capable and nice friends / guild members, you'll have decent gear pretty soon.\n- Once you know how to look for a group it's easy to find one. If you ask nicely, the other members of your new group will probably slow down and explain why they are doing what they are doing and may even act as tour guides during quests.\n- The game is heavily instanced which I happen to like.\n- While it is easy to ♥♥♥♥ up on character creation, there is plenty of information on the forums how not to. Make no mistake, your first character will be utterly incompetent. If trying, testing and scrapping different builds of characters translates to "fun" for you, this is your game. You'll hardly find a game that gives you more freedom to create  your  character.\n- Yes, you can spend money on the game. I certainly did over the years but you don't have to. If you've got the time or patience you can farm enough of the shop currency "Turbine Points" to buy everything you need. And you'll simply earn those points by just playing.\n- The graphics are older but still decent enough.\n- No involuntary PvP. If you like really well done PvE though, give DDO a try.\n- If you need advice or help ingame, just go into the next tavern (because players idle there to regenerate and have some spare time on their hands) and ask. Send someone you see with "wings" left and right of their character's name a polite /tell and chances are good you'll get your answer or a hint where to look.\n- Huge amount of freedom when it comes to character builds, I cannot emphasise this enough.\n- Active combat! You might even have to use your brain sometimes. Just standing around while spamming attacks and holding everything on cooldown is not how combat works in DDO.\n- Always new and fun ways to die. Did you know that the teleport spell comes with the possibility of depositing you a few hundred metres above the marketplace? Hope you remember where your Ring of Feather Fall is while panicking.\n\n\nI have to admit, that the game is past it's prime but it has aged well. You certainly should give it a try if you are into D&D. After all, it's F2P.","February 19, 2015","true","520.8"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","37","42","8","0"

In other MMOs I have played, I've just ended up wandering through the starting area doing quests, never feeling the need to party with other players. In Dungeons & Dragons Online (DDO), if you want to complete the dungeons on the highest difficulty setting, having other players around is a great boon. Traps alone can give many adventurers a lot of trouble, and having(or being) a player that can disable them makes them a valuable member of a party. And, while many experienced players have ways of keeping themselves alive regardless of class, everyone appreciates a good healer.\n\nI also love the high level of customization available in DDO. You have the option to set your own ability scores (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, and CHA), allocate your own skills (Search and Disable Device are paramount for trappers, while Jump is more generally useful), and choose your own feats, including fighting styles such as Two-Handed, Two Weapon(including "unarmed" combat), Single Weapon, and Shield Mastery. Casters have the option of taking metamagic feats such as Maximize and Empower to increase the destructive(or healing) power of their spells, or Heighten and the various Spell Focuses to make them harder to resist (especially useful for instant kill spells and Crowd Control).\n\nA less desirable feature to many players may be that the game is heavily instanced. There aren't many vast areas to explore; many quest entrances are accessed directly from town, and each party will be in a separate instance of each quest or wilderness zone. While I feel that this was necessary to encourage cooperation to the extent that they have, I can understand players who may think this makes the world feel smaller.\n\nAlso, a large portion of the game is behind P2P bars, despite the game itself being Free to Play. You CAN earn Turbine Points in-game and unlock the content of the game without spending a cent, but I have heard that it is better to consider the game a subscription-based game with a limited free trial than a truly free to play game, and I can appreciate that standpoint. If you start playing the game without unlocking any content, you can feel the P2P walls start closing in on you, starting especially around level 6-8 (level cap is 30, so this is higher than it sounds compared to other games).\n\nThat said, I feel that the pros outweigh the cons for this game; feel free to jump in for free, and see how well you like it before commiting to paying for anything, and I definitely recommend waiting for sales before purchasing Adventure Packs to make the most out of your Turbine Points.","December 23, 2015","true","694.1"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","30","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XorianMadness/recommended/206480/","XorianMadness","-W3E- Xorian Madness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XorianMadness/","48 products in account","I've played this MMO for years, before it was even on steam. So really, I do want to recommend it to people. Some people looking at this game have probably felt the sting of Pay to Win games before, and to some extent for new players this can be their initial reaction. Ergo I wish to describe as fully as I can the things that made me a fan of this game, and also concede on points others would have in an argument against it.\n\nPros:\n-This game is 10 years old. That may not seem like a good thing and, it isn't inherently. The way I found this out however, is through the events they recently had for it's anniversary. It celebrated the entire game from it's conception to now, players got to crash an anniversary party, cleave the heads off of some of the more prominent and sometimes frustrating Developers via NPC inserts, in jokes abound from things such as their old web ads and finally FINALLY finding brocolli. (An odd statement to anyone who hasn't played, I'm sure.) My point with this is that it has a very well founded community. A week before this event launched, the Developers had a live stream wherein they went to every server systematically, carpet bombed public areas with loot that you can ONLY be given by devs, and punished greedy players when they stuck around a little too long by spawning dragons, beholders, and giant killer robots in the public areas where they would never have been encountered. The Devs care about the game, and most of the players I've spoken with on my own frequented server are the kind of people you could hang out with without cusswords flung at each other, which is a good thing because...\n\n-This game is highly co-operative. It's possible to solo what easily amounts to 80% of the content, give or take. That doesn't ever mean it's preferable to run through everything by yourself. Honestly this was the one MMORPG I've tried my hand at where grouping together was genuinely appealing. If I'm playing a Cleric, Wizard, Barbarian, etc. it is, from the perspective of those classes, a very very nice thing to have a Rogue in the party. Every quest is in an instance, and you can either take 6-12 man teams into it depending on the quest/raid. Some of these quests are riddled with traps, hidden doors for extra loot and experience when you crack them open and head through to find some rare enemy that wasn't really on your to-do list. The traps range from easy to walk around, placed in an area you aren't required to go through, to being a repeatedly exploding ball of pure evil that attempts to also paralyze you when you activate it, and again with every blast. Rogues can turn off all of the above traps as you run your way through. That doesn't mean rogue is an easy mode class either, since when it comes to all of the enemies you'll face... playing a Rogue, you would have some of the least HP, and you do greatly increased damage to many enemies when they are ticked off at one of your pals, not looking at you. Grouping together in quests is actually really satisfying, since you can get much more done together than alone.\n\n-EXP availability is high. All of the quests you've done once, you can do again. Furthermore quests give bonus experience for going out of your way to do things like killing a majority, if not just all the enemies in a quest, finding x amount of secret doors, turning off x amount of traps, and even just plain breaking enough things (They had it coming, that table and chair set was ugly and my Barbarian has no care for social standards, earning more XP, Win-Win)\n\n-The sheer amount, and quality of content. Look, I'll be honest here, the level cap is 30. How much content can you possibly cram into thirty levels? Well... a lot, and it isn't poorly made in my opinion either. Since the game started in early beta, when the level cap advancing to TEN was a milestone, the developers have made every quest save for a few, and the stories behind them marvelously. When I hit level 15, one of my very favorite quest/story arcs is "harbinger of madness." Not to spoil too much, but what begins as an investigation into missing persons quickly turns into dealing with fashion obsessed denizens from a dimension composed of raw insanity.\n\n-It stays as true as it can to good old, Pen and Paper D&D. Everything you do in this game is on a dice system. Not one that is ever slow to respond (unless you have a connection lag, which is better than it used to be.) but immediately shows you information like "Okay, I rolled a 20 with my great axe against this beholder. That means I vorpal hit. So, I automatically critically hit the enemy, depending on my weapon's stats and if they are dependant on that roll do a ton more damage, and since I have a great axe, deal triple my normal damage regardless. Hulk smash!" but you don't ever have to wait on that line of thinking, or really pay attention to it in a lot of cases. It will roll for every swing, for granting you every point of damage in real time. Then, remember when I said rogues were great for disabling traps? Well, they have to roll dice the good old fashioned way. They have to roll dice to find it if it hasn't already started being a thorn in your side, and a check to disable device. This is a skill they can train, sometimes so high as to let them guarantee it turns off... sometimes not. When not so, it can hilariously blow up in their face (literally) and no further attempt to turn it off can be made, depending on how poor they rolled.\n\n-It isn't the most impossible thing to obtain paid for content. When you first step into the game, I have no doubt you will be intimidated by the amount of locked races, classes, and quest packs. However, unlike most games with some arbitrary "Trade random player X amount of normal currency for X amount of "paid currency" it isn't the hardest thing to get said paid currency WITHOUT paying. Every time you run a quest for the first time on a given difficulty, you earn points towards getting a nice chunk of change in the form of Turbine Points. Even more so, the points themselves give you bonuses too. New players might want to get points with "The Coin Lords" for up to 2 extra, FREE backpack slots per character, all while earning progress towards currency to buy that class/race/quest you want, and most of which I've found decently priced... mostly.\n\nI could say so many great things about this game, and while I still recommend it, I can't ignore the negatives.\n\nCons:\n-Plain and simply this is a damn buggy game sometimes. Some bugs are exploitable, some are debilitating, some are a particular place in a particular dungeon which will get you trapped forever, some are ladders which you just can't climb in certain places. The devs are always working on them apparently, and bug reports help, but the flyswatter hardly ever seems to fall on important issues. One of my character's abilities, at the time of writing this review, CAN ROB MY TEAM OF LEVELS TEMPORARILY! It's only supposed to do so in an aoe against the, you know, ENEMIES!\n\n-There are some content pieces which I can't deny, definitely appear to be unreasonably priced. While there are weekly sales which, especially near holidays, cut prices on certain groups of items from the cash shop dramatically... sometimes you can look at two items right next to each other and wonder why the more expensive one is actually more expensive. Like most races costing 995 Turbine points (TP) whereas the most recent costs well over 1,200\n\n-Some of the best quests are paid for. Especially my favorite listed above.\n\n-There is a serious lack of endgame content. The usual system is to, once you reach at least level 20, restart your character at level one, with a choice of any class/race you have, and be stronger every time you restart. However, content at level 20+ seems lacking in scale compared to everything below so... why even push to 30?","April 23","true","173.5"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uhka-M/recommended/206480/","Uhka-M","Finnish Chicken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uhka-M/","162 products in account","I decided to re-write this review which I did 3 years ago. A lot of things have changed\n\nDungeons & Dragons Online (DDO) is an MMORPG where are both explorable areas and different dungeons and raids you can do with your character, which depending how you build them. The game also has different difficulties you can run dungeons with, as well as even harder difficulties once you get to the late game. The game heavily leans toward co-op playing with either your friends, guildies or strangers. There is actually no proper PvP in this game.\n\nPros:+ Character creation. There are 14 different classes and 9 different races. Not only that but you can multi-class in this game however you like up to 3 different classes, though it's adviced that you know then why you're multi-classing. There are also Iconic classes which gives you a certain race benefit, but "requires" you to start with a certain pre-determined class. You however do get XP enough to level right away to level 15, so you still somewhat keep some kind of freedom for your character.\n+ Difficulty settings in dungeons for both the starters and hardcore players.\n+ Co-op heavily encouraged. Gather friends and you will have fun.\n+ Large explorable areas and lots of different dungeons for you to try out playing.\n\nNeutrals:* Earning DDO in-game store money by just playing. You get a repeatable 25 TP from time to time when you do quests. You also get one-time bonuses if you do quests for the first time in that server. Highly recommended to do on all servers to get you couple of things unlocked for you from the DDO Store. However this can be grindy, and will  bore you easily. Moreover you definitely need either someone to open the quests for you for repeated TPs, or you need to make a secondary account to just do that.\n* Lootgen. The game after Update 29 loot generation was scrapped and replaced with way worse loot, which didn't fit with my equipemnt or characters at all. However for the new players this shouldn't be a problem. This is moreover a warning that you might see two different kinds of loot in the auction house for instance. Also the lootgen weapons are way inferior to any named weapons\n* Complexity. The game can be complex to new players, especially those who haven't even touched the original DnD board game. You have a lot to learn, so DDOWiki will be your best friend at guiding you through the mechanics, like spell saves and multiclassing.\n* Combat. The combat isn't nowadays like it was. You will see a lot of people and sooner or later yoruself just running through the dungeon, stopping only to kill things which are easy to dispose of, for both melee and spell casters. The combat might become boring in certain quests, but there are also fights which also makes you tense up really well, especially with a group not with people who know the quest already\n\nCons:- The game is dying. During the EU primetime the servers might as well be dead, but even during US primetime you won't see that many groups anymore. Currently I believe every server except Wayfinder has only 400 on the US primetime, and less than 200 in EU primetime. Wayfinder has only 100 during US primetime and 50 on EU primetime.\n- Character appearance. There isn't much you can do to change the appearance of a character other than pre-set hair, facial details, nose, mouth and their color.\n- Paywall. A lot of the dungeons are needed to buy first. Also half of the races and classes are behind a paywall also. The prices range from 2 to 15 euros for adventure packs and 25 for expansion packs (which can be on Steam sales for very low price). However you will be fine without buying anything if you don't mind do a little bit of running the same dungeon multiple times. Also remember you can earn these still for free by just playing.\n- No PvP. There are these arenas you can go to but no one is actively searching for PvP since it is heavily biased towards caster classes and those who are at max level.\n- Graphics are out-dated. This game is from 2004, and they haven't really still updated the look of the game in old contents.\n- No endgame. Basically once you get to the highest level (currently 30) there is nothing to do but to make your character get better armor unless you want to start from level 1 again with a thing called True Reincarnation, which makes you keep all the items from earlier, and other small benefits. Otherwise the endgame pretty much is running quests over and over again, and every third day running couple of raids hoping to get a named item from there. In short, the endgame isn't worth it at all. Hence you will see a lot of people just True Reincarnate over and over again to keep playing the levels which were interesting-ish.\n\nThe game used to be fun to play with. But with the recent changes and the paywall being way too big, I just can't recommend this anymore. The game is just too old and due to the developers only focusing on new P2P content and not even promoting it in any way, the game is dying slowly. You're better off saving your money to something newer like Neverwinter or Guild Wars 2.","May 5","false","418.5"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","35","41","0","4"

Truth be told I found it a lot more enjoyable than when I first played it when it became free. So much so that I decided to actually buy some features. The trick is... learning the tricks in the first place!\n\nThe game is free to play, and despite what others may think, you most certainly do not need to pay a thing to hit level 20 and reincarnate. While it is true you can buy things to increase your power, it does not approach "pay to win" levels of brokenness. Should you decide the game is worth spending money on, I recommend a discounted Menace of the Underdark (which is available right now if you know how to do it, or wait for the rare Steam sale).\n\nThere are a LOT of the cash shop items that try to bleed you dry. Some seem reasonable to me, whilst others hell no. Seriously, $12-$15 for experience items on a single character? For reference, farming in-game currency is roughly 25 cents an hour at best... which is kind of a poor way to spend one's time.\n\nDespite being a MMO, all quests are instanced. This means that the only time you will ever run into people is in towns. In a way it's nice, but it also feels empty for soloers in that regard.\n\nIt's quite possible to solo your way to 20, which is what my first character did. If you're a soloer, don't be afraid to hire some hirelings, especially healing ones. They are dirt cheap and they don't rob you of any experience at all. They do cause more monsters to spawn like what would happen in a group setting, but it's usually worth the increased survivability. For a rough time estimate, it took me a solid month of semi-dedicated playing and no knowledge of any quests to reach 20. With actual game knowledge, I could probably cut that time in half. With a good group, you can probably cut that in half yet again. And now there's a built in +20% daily completion bonus that should help speed things up.\n\nThe Action point/Enhancement system recently got a revamp and went from horrendous to kind of cool. Out of all the free MMORPG's these days, this is the only one I spent money on.","August 22, 2013","true","1.9"," 35 of 52 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","35","52","0","2"

The game has changed substantially since release, and in its present form is no longer for me. Turbine has made the stats excessively complicated, to the point where the game barely resembles D&D. You thought all you had to worry about was ability points, skills, feats, and equipment. Those, along with buffs, would determine your AC, to-hit and damage, HP, spell DC, etc. Now you need to think about PRR, MRR, % Dodge, Universal Spell Power, Elemental Spell Power, Doublestrike %, whether your bonuses come from enhancement, alchemical, morale, song, profane, psionic, luck, sacred...They have also, on multiple occasions, made build-breaking changes to feats and mechanics in the name of 'balance' in a game where PvP is at best an ancillary feature. The enhancement system has been completely redone at least 3 times, and individual prestige classes continue to be tweaked (or ignored).\n\nThe game has been on a freefall slide into a grindfest ever since crafting was introduced. Run raid for mats, run to next raid for loot, run to next raid for more loot, repeat on multiple characters, wait for timers to reset and while you are waiting, grind mats from zones and tokens from epic. This is the essence of DDO today. And what is the reward? Aside from playing through all of the content (much of which is quite good if you take the time to enjoy it), nothing. You can reincarnate your character for a small, stacking bonus and play through all of the content again. But good luck finding groups to run with, as most vets by now are well on their way to completionist status, having reincarnated as every playable class. Not to mention that they are (and this is no exaggeration) months ahead of you on gear. With timers it is temporally impossible for you to craft high level weapons and gear in any reasonable amount of time. You can't even claim that its a social experience. PUGs are virtually non-existent and most people are in guilds only for the buffs.\n\nTo be fair, most of the dungeons in this game are very polished, and new content is generally good. Though there is no open, sandbox world, there is a ton of instanced content and occasionally in-game events that the devs put a lot of work into. If you have a group of friends to run with, or can find a good and active guild, this is STILL a great game. Despite what you may hear in-game, you don't NEED crafted gear to complete most of the content in the game, but you can expect challenges along the way. To me that's more fun than mindless destroying content, but most high level players disagree. And who can blame them? They've been playing the same content for years.","March 16","false","76.3"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","0"

It wouldn't even install on my system (OS X 10.9.5), apparently due to some problems with the third-party downloader...which I don't see a reason for even including, given that Steam downloads all 8 GB worth of game content anway. So I haven't been able to run it at all in Steam, but the Windows version runs fine in Wineskin.\n\nGOOD:\n- The game captures a surprising amount of the feel of actually playing D&D. There's DM narration during quests, a lot of the mechanics from the tabletop game are included, and you have to do more than just kill monsters. There are spot checks to find hidden doors, traps to avoid, NPCs to bluff and even some puzzles to solve.\n\n- Soloing is supported more than in most MMOs.\n\n- Most of the game content is instanced: the only public areas are the towns, and most of the quests take place in instanced areas with a linear narrative. As a result, there are way fewer "kill 20 zebras" or "collect 10 rocks" quests than you might expect in an MMO.\n\n- It's free, so if you hate it, you're not out anything more than the couple hours it takes to download.\n\n- There are a TON of options for building a character (three trees per class and multiclassing), although several classes are behind pay walls.\n\nBAD:\n- The graphics and interface are really dated, and the voice acting is pretty bad.\n\n- The player base is small.\n\n- The downside of the character customization freedom and the jillions of different numbers brought over from the tabletop game is that the mechanics are really complicated. I imagine (I haven't gotten anywhere near endgame) that optimizing a character for raiding would be REALLY hard.\n\n- There's a lot of pay-wall stuff that pops up right out of the gate.

The concept is set in Eberron, which is a kind of high-magic crystal-punk sort of setting, and the game is played almost entirely through instanced dungeon work.\n\nThere are reasons that D&D is not played in realtime, and this game demonstrates exactly why. An instant save-or-die death spell on the tabletop can have a dramatic buildup leading the clattering of that 20-sided die; in a realtime game, you just die suddenly for no readily apparent reason, which engenders neither tension nor "what could I have done better" counterplay thoughts so much as it simply engenders stunned contempt. The same can go for high end blast spells and traps, many of which can kill characters instantly.\n\nThey'll often do so with little more than a 'klick,' too, because the sound assets in this game are the poorest I've heard outside bad indie games. Your mighty two-handed sword will do little more than sort of lightly 'dink' while it slices a devastating critical hit through a gnoll; your entire team can be killed by a sonic trap that strongly reminds one of a rather shy doorbell, while, conversely, the discovery of secret doors leads to a deafening CLUNK that overshadows the din of any battle. The upshot is that there's no feel of impact to pitched melee battles. The music has been added to in the many expansions, but never replaced, meaning the early-game music is poor and repetitive.\n\nBetween that and lacklustre animations, the combat - which is what you will be spending the overarching majority of your time in Stormreach doing, this being a fantasy MMO - feels weak and ephemeral. By aiming for a more quasirealistic if colorful fantasy look, the character art assets might have been good in 2006, but have not aged wonderfully. While I hate to contrast to WoW, WoW's cartoonier style certainly helped preserve its original, dated models for a longer functional time; these assets currently sleep at the bottom of the uncanny valley.\n\nThe dungeons are pains to navigate, the quest UI is poor to nonfunctional, power (even if not strictly necessary power) is sold via the game's microtransaction system in the form of stat-boosting Tomes and field self-revives.\n\nIs there anything positive to say? A little. The game does, unlike many MMOs, have more comprehensible mechanics to those experienced with the D&D 3.5 system, and so it's easier to see what's going on under the hood. The game also manages to successfully break the Holy Trinity (tank/healer/DPS) so prevalent in many other MMOs with a very fluid and diverse class system. Character customizability always was a strength of D&D 3.0/3.5, and that’s unquestionably present.  The Dungeon Master, a voice who narrates things your character is ostensibly experiencing, is a welcome nod to the tabletop.\n\nOutside of that, though, it’s hard to recommend it, even to fans of the D&D 3.5 system. Fantasy adventures are not in short supply at the moment, and it’s probably best to seek them elsewhere.","December 7, 2014","false","74.9"," 31 of 49 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","31","49","0","0"

Each player gets their own loot from chests which can be switched around and given to others via the chest's item drop-down menu allowing for some Bound to Account/Character items to be traded before they're claimed.\nThe leveling system in this game is real easy to learn but very complex and detailed when you truely understand it allowing for pretty much any combination of classes that don't clash to work. There are thousands of custom player-made builds to try on the forums which give you an edge over a standard build. Being able to combine up to 3 classes will also give you an edge too. Want to play as a caster but still be able to disable traps? No problem! Combine Wizard and Rogue for the easiest of them all.\nThe True Reincarnation mechanic of this game allows for endless play, as once you hit the heroic level cap of 20 you unlock the ability to remake your character with benefits. You gain +4 points for your build from Adventurer to Hero, +2 from Hero to Legend and it caps at 36. Champion characters will only gain a +2 stat boost going into Hero as they already start at 32 points. Each time you True Reincarnate (TR), you gain extra abilities based on your previous life. For example, if you were a Barbarian in your last life, you gain 10 HP. All passive past life feats stack up to 3 times. Also, you can take an 'Active' past life feat which allows for extra boosts ingame such as Barbarian's 'Berserker's fury' past life feat allowing you to use a Rage like ability in which a Barbarian has as a different class.\nHeroic and Epic levels are a fairly new feature of DDO which has only really come around in the past few years and is still massively developing. Now the level cap has been raised to 28 allowing for more Feats and Stats to be gained, giving an even greater advantage over your enemies in quests. With this came a new item system that has 4 different tiers of loot for Heroic and Epic quests. These items are paired with the difficulty they were looted in, giving boosts greater if the difficulty was too.\nThis is an EXCELLENT F2P game as you NEVER have to buy anything in the game if you decide you don't want to, as you get 'Favor' for completing quests which in turn grants you 'Turbine Points' to spend in the store.\n\nThe bads:\nDDO has a lot of flaws in its own right, but none more than your average MMORPG. It's always going to have bugs which the community are always trying to stamp out through the use of the public beta test client, Lamannia.\nDDO IS a pay2win game. You'll never get to level 28 at the current state of the game unless you get some of the epic-level addon content.\n\nSummary:\nAlthough there may seem more good points than bad, you'll find a lot more yourself from just playing in both aspects. Each person has their own preference of games and whats in them and I love DDO because it's a group-based game. You'll find it much easier to complete quests and objectives if you team up with 5 other people. DDO is an ever-expanding game which is currently on its 25th major update excluding patches for bugs. I could write an essay that makes A Song of Ice and Fire look small and easy to read on whats great and what sucks about the game, but nobody would want to read it. I'd be surprised if people actually read this far into my review. Anyway, going off on a tangent, the game is amazing if you like to team up with friends to go on an epic adventure through the levels, facing different enemies on the way from slimy, annoying ooze monsters that love to break your weapons to Acid-breathing dragons and much more.\n\nI'd give this game a rating of 7.5 out of 10, as it still has a long way to go to be able to catch up with the major MMOs such as Guild Wars 2 and World of Warcraft. On the other hand, it holds its own playstyle I've yet to see in any other MMO of group-based questing from the start.\n\nIf you do decide to play the game, Cannith is a great server! Thousands of players always willing to help you, all you need to do is ask. Just remember, asking around for help in the starter area won't get you far, you have to venture out into the world.\n\nHope to see you in-game soon! ^_^","April 1, 2015","true","515.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","3"

Essentially what happens is every 2 or 3 months Turbine releases an update that either completely alters the gameplay experience or breaks 3 or 4 old quests (or both), and they slowly hotfix about 50-75% of it (I've seen a Level 2 quest that's been around since before I started playing being unavailable for an ENTIRE update period!), and then they release a new update. As for gameplay, it's ok as far as D&D-based TPHSMMORPGS's go.\n\nLack of proper support and lousy management decisions aside, the community is good, the fanbase is awesome and there's something to do for every non-epic level (1-20) without having to pay for anything.\n\nIf you like D&D-based games that have gone off-track a little (think in the direction of WoW), this may be the time sink you need. Otherwise, there's tons of other (more populated) MMO's that might suit your fancy.","January 1, 2015","true","122.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","12","16","3","0"

The problem comes with the fact that you do not have access to every content. So with the already small population, it makes teaming harder. (The tool to find a group though is the best).\n\nI just started back at Mod 9 Update 29 and played few weeks and got really disapointed. The core mechanics of Dungeon and Dragon are no longer present. There is no longer the rule of 1d20 + attack bonus >= Armor Class. That was a simple rule and easy to understand.\n\nAlso now, monsters have ridiculours hp. More than 500 hp for normal mobs is not normal at level 14. For a boss once in a while ok, but really, its gotten out of hand. I prefered before when they had a good AC with a lot less hp.\n\nThere is also the guild airship. They can give you buffs, but now there is just too many that you dont care anymore (30+).\n\nAlso, even though enhancements (kind of feats) is fun (I used to love it because it adds some customization to the character) it became more powerful than taking a feat. It was really something when you actually take a feat (in most cases you have 7 to choose (for a level 20 char)). You have access to 80 enhancement points and for 1 point, you get 2 AC, etc.\n2 AC is what you would get with an epic level feat (21+), not a level 1 character.\n\nThe more they update the game, the more they stray from the real dungeon and dragon.\nWhile it still can be a fun game (I did not bother listing the positive and obvious negative such as the outdated graphics), it is shadowed by bad decisions by making it a greedy generic MMO that you would find anywhere.","January 6","false","167.7"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","22","35","2","0"

I don't like the world setting though as I am partial to Forgotten Realms and Sigil. But playing an adventure in DDO for the first time really does feel like a D&D session, which can be refreshing.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nHuge paywalls. All over. You can grind or buy points to unlock things but owning everything translates to spending a few hundred dollars on it, realistically.\n\nIts an MMO = repetiton. You do the same dungeons but there are a lot to play (if you buy them). The flip side is there is tons of loot. Awesome loot. Rare loot. Randomly generated loot. All sorts of cool items borderlands style. To me this does balance out the repitation a but. Then again because its an MMO it means you need to invest a lot of time with the game. Not an issue if you LOVE it but... To be fair you can play it for free an dorta 'try be fore you buy.'\n\nLeading me to loop back around and say that in order to really enjoy the game 99% of people would want to invest cash into it. Free mode is limited. But as I said you can grind it by just playing to gain points (slowly) and buy cash shop features.\n\nNew kids today would not like the graphics or art style, I don't think. Its aged a bit. I don't mind it and some of the weapons/ armors look pretty cool. But this is not visually stunning even on max everything. Looks alright though.\n\nIts an old game... community wise. Everyone is high level. If you don't know what you are doing so much then you won't be invited to play. Guilds are tightly locked with routines so its going to be a challange to find a group or PUGs for lower level content.\n\nQuickslots. I swear this ruins it for me. Years ago I didn't mind a game like this. But now a days a game with like 9 ROWS of quickslots is... ya dude screw that happy poop. I like how Elder Scrolls Online, Guild Wars 1 and The Secret World approach MMO action UIs : give me like 8 or 9 skills max but let me pick from hundreds. Make it more about tactics.\nThis one is crazy. My level 3 druid has actually 7 full quickslot rows, being 12 skills long. That's over kill. All those potions, consumables and spells PLUS the special attacks then racial and class abilities then the level perk actives... see what I mean? But ya some folks like that.\n\nITS NOT A BAD GAME! And its F2P so give it a go if you like D&D and wanna try it. Its not perfect but its not bad either just be aware of the things I mentioned above before you jump in. I give the game a solid 4/5 but sometimes I think about DDO and rate it a 3/5. Its good but I'm not that active in it and all those dang quickslots!!!","May 8","true","38.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

DDO isn't like that, DDO is focused on the 'game' part; character building (my personal favourite part, just like real DnD) and play-style are very important, so if you want an MMO with unique and interesting gameplay, give DDO a try.\n\nHowever, this gameplay focus came at a remarkable cost; the social aspect, every quest is an instance, which while making them unique, means you can't just party up with people half-way and make friends easy; you have to make groups beforehand and go into the dungeon together. Of course the Devs don't expect us to do that all by ourselves, so there is a "Grouping" menu, where people can put out server-wide messages to find people to quest with; and it works well enough. But- the DDO community has gained a very... "elitist" edge to it over time, and try as I might, I am not exempt to this rule; many in-game factors make it hard not to become rather "elitist", per se, over time. Many people are interested only in speed running dungeons for optimal xp, and have little-to-no-interest in making friends. This can make things very hard for newer players, who want to take it slow, learn the rather complex mechanics, and make some friends.\n\nAll in all, I love DDO and would love to see it thrive, but until the Devs overhaul the starter area, early levels and social aspect, (I say this, I have no idea what they could do to spice them up though :/), I can only really recommed DDO to groups - at least 2 people (max party size is 6) - who are looking for a group based, challenging PvE RPG that rewards effort and planning.","March 19, 2015","true","262.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The Eberron setting is unique and a lot of fun.\n\nThere are several classes available for you to select right from the start, and your four "basic" D&D races, Humans, Dwarves, Elves and Halflings.  And while each race does have a certain feel and flavor about them, as with proper D&D, you are free to combine whatever class you can with whatever race you can.\n\nThat said, there are some classes and races that can only be unlocked via Cash Shop.  Or you can get a subscription.  Due note, not all classes are unlocked with a subscription, and they are unlocked only for the subscription.  Best to just buy them outright.\n\nYes, there's a lot of slow going for this game, you don't just rush to the end.  But when you do get there, you can "reset" your character, causing them to be revived at low level, but with an extra stat points on your build, which lets you make an even more powerful character.\n\nIf you're looking for a D&D game that'll get you hip-deep in the mechancis of it, this is the game for you.  If you're looking for something more MMO and modern, look into Neverwinter, which is based on the 4th edition rules.","April 15, 2015","true","78.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The difficulty of learning how the game works (menus, hotkeys, rules, etc...) is not too overbearing on first-time players and can be picked up very quickly. Games such as STO (Star Trek Online), while also being a great MMO, have a much steeper learning curve when it comes to the interface, knowing where to go or how to do something is much more difficult and takes a longer time, like many other MMOs. There are some picky things about DDO, and some would agree or disagree, everyone is entitled to how they think MMOs should play. However, DDO doesn't have "grinding" or any monotonous quests. Every single one is unique and exciting. A very BALANCED (being that it IS Dungeon & Dragons) party is definitely recommended for later quests in the game. As frustrating as that sounds, I'll counter that with the fact that it is incredibly fun having a defined role in a party (Healer, DPS, Trapper, Tank, etc....) and that not many MMOs (if any at all) have that sort of specific role-placement. If there ARE any, I can guarentee that it's nowhere as refined as DDO. The leveling system IS slow, because you rank up 4 times before actually gaining a level. That being said, it gives you a huge sense of accomplishment when you DO level up, every race and class are so unique that when you level up you feel like you're creating your own unique character that no one has ever done. A huge helper is that the game is FTP, although if you get addicted enough, you WILL end up spending money. I recommend this game, and since it's FTP, there is nothing to lose. I hope this recommendation helps your decision, whoever you may be.","November 25, 2013","true","185.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

I loved its combat system, instanced dungeons and social focus.\n\nHowever, the game has taken a turn for the worst.\ntl;dr Money is basically irrelevant unless you have a lot of it. Difficulty is meaningless. Either you can solo elite or your build isn't viable. Difficulty takes the form of giving the mobs more stats instead of actual meaningful difficulty.\n\nPros:\n- Fun for groups.\n- Innovative true reincarnation system.\n- Multiclassing and build planning is fun.\n- Still updating.\n\nNeutral:\n- Grindy but not bad. If you know how to do the dungeon, it takes 3-10 minutes to complete it and you normally do it 3/5 times minimum, 10 times maximum.\n- True reincarnation adds to the grind.\n\nCons:\n- Might as well be a subscription game. You hit a brick wall at level 14 unless you're spending money. Or grinding for favor.\n- Very strict definition of what is viable, especially in the newer dungeons and at high level.\n- It's a dying game. Hard to find groups if you're not at the high levels.\n- Not recommended unless you have a premade group that plays regularly.\n- Regularly bugged. Not too intrusive, but not recommended if you don't have patience.\n- Updates aren't fixing the problem.","May 4","false","317.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","1"

The game has been around a while and has an established community.  There is plenty of content.  As a dungeons and dragons game, it has several races and classes to choose from and at each level you can choose class and skills, similar to the 3rd edition(s) of dungeons and dragons.  I found the gameplay smooth and controls easy to use.  Quests were entertaining and I liked exlporing the city.  The quests are all instanced so you don't have to compete, though you can take a party of adventurers. When my friends weren't available, I found content that I could manage by myself or with one of the game's hirelings (AI helper).  There is some content that you don't get with the free to play - extra races, some dungeon areas, and a few classes - but there is still plenty of content to keep you interested all the way to highest levels.  I do note that PVP was very limited - only in special arenas in the taverns (bar fights).  Graphics are excellent.  As expected in D&D, there are tons of spells, equipment, monster types, etc.  Stealth and lockpicking are included and work well.","March 18, 2015","true","15.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

On one hand is it' s downsides; including (but not limited to) expencive VIP sub, limited F2P options (starts really limiting you at level 8) and very slow turbine point gain for F2P players, limiting their ability to  purchace adventures. However, for those willing to pay for all the things that would need paying for, it is a jolly old time indeed. It is, by far, the best MMORPG created this side of Ultima online and Wurm. Seriously, the combat is the best I have ever experienced in any MMO ever. The dungeons are instanced: no more fetch 100 slimes or kill 50 goblins! Quests are all interesting and never a bore. Quests could range from having you go through an onslaught of foes to defeat the final boss to having you destroy crates while being unable to kill a certain type of monster. The game follows the lore of DDO very well. There is a HUGE amount of freedom in character creation. However, the business practices of WB and turbine are... questionable. The DLC packs are expencive, and you will find yourself paying for adventures because the subscription is so expencive. Even then, subscribers don't have all the content. You must still pay for stuff. All in all, I recommend this game ONLY IF  YOU ARE WILLING TO PAY SOMETHING. Buying something with real money unlocks character slots and favor growth (which is used to gain rep with factions and get free stuff like races and classes).","April 28, 2015","true","260.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

For the last few years now, since around 2010, this game has been on my Steam account collecting dust, and is the standard nostalgic game that you have on the shelf that you haven't played in years. So you walk into your bedroom, bored out of your mind, and you ask yourself what you're going to do to pass the time; that's when you see this game sitting on the shelf.\n\nYou're wide-eyed, surprised to see it, and instantly grab the dusty game case and look at it with nostalgic visions of how much fun you had with it. However, about six hours of gameplay and perhaps a few days off and on with the game, you begin to realize why it was collecting dust on your shelf, and you kind of want to put it back where it was.\n\nDungeons & Dragons Online is an amazing FTPMMO, don't get me wrong, but it's flawed; oh boy is it flawed. As a massive Dungeons & Dragons fan/player, I jumped onboard when I found out about this game and signed up and started playing, only to find true horrors to await for me. Combat is all over the place with various degrees of difficulty for more hauls of loot and experience for your character, the quests themselves are simple fetch-quests or the standard "kick in the door" style of game in which you saunter over to an Orc's cozy cottage, kick in its door and then brutally slaughter it and its family. There isn't really a whole level of role-playing IN the game, it's a hack and slash MMO and the players are forced to role-play with their friends to gain a better experience.\n\nNow the two grated problems with this game, wait, THREE problems are as followed: Character Creation, Character Development, and Character Interaction.\n\nRight out of the gate as a player, you're instantly penalized in the character creator with having incredibly low stats and penalizing you if you're not a paying member for Turbine. With that, you're tossed out onto the sandy beaches of Korthos Island with a poor chance of holding your own against the enemies that await you in the Hard and Elite difficulties, unless you min/max your character mainly into a Cleric, Fighter, Paladin, or Monk (which is a member class).\n\nCharacter development is also lacking greatly in this game, due to its constraints as a video game, let alone an MMO. In the actual pen and paper version of the game, your character has an immense amount of space to develop into whatever version of the class you choose to be. Want to be a wizard that specializes in certain spells and feats to optimize said spells? Can't do that in DDO. Want to become a minion summoning spellcaster that can command a multitude of summoned creatures to defend you and do as you will? Can't do that in DDO. You're given three to four skill trees, depending on your character's class, and race, which you put Action Points (AP) into to gain a variety of bonus abilities and traits to aid you within the game. However, while this on paper or in my review may sound like an amazing concept, in practice, the abilities are very subpar and don't really mesh well with the game. On several occasions, the special attacks or perks just seemed lackluster and a waste of my Action Points, and at times, I even questioned if they were better than basic attacks.\n\nCharacter interaction may be the biggest glaring obstacle in this game for me. Guilds, adventuring parties, and raid groups are the main defacto groups for players to interact with each other, and are the vanilla concept for any MMORPG. I get it, MMO's nowadays need to catch up to World of Warcraft's template and show that they're hip and cool, but when it comes to Dungeons & Dragons, the grandaddy of the entire role-playing game genre, you should show some more respect. Every player is required to join a party to do several questlines, even if they have started the first three quests and are on the final homestretch of the adventure, as well as being incredibly handicapped when it comes to not being in a guild with people they do not know. The way the game ropes players in to joining said guilds are with benefits such as cheaper healing prices, and low-level gear is now cheaper, however, the only way to obtain such perks is to spam other players invitations to those guilds. You see, the way guilds progress in the game, is by member count; the higher the count, the more perks unlocked. This means that a player exiting the boat from the tutorial region, is almost assailed by fledgling guilds and end-game guilds who want that finally person in their roster to get the perk they've been dying to obtain and that is just wrong. For the last 180 hours clocked in over four years, the only time I actually discussed anything in the chat with other people, were the few friends I had who enjoyed or were anxious to join me on Dungeons & Dragons Online and those times were few and far between.\n\nAll in all, and with a heavy and decisive "no", I've got to give this game a 4.5/5 out of 10.","July 3, 2014","false","178.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Harsh landscapes have been traversed and deep dungeons have been explored by those dreamed of living in another world and embarking on untold of adventure. Those were the days when such basement meetings were widely frowned upon, and those who partook in the art of Dungeons and Dragons were widely shunned or treated as pariahs. Does anyone remember the great Tom Hanks scare? What about the ridiculous ‘Dark Dungeons’ Chick tract that led many to believe D&D was nothing more than a tool of the devil?\n\nThose days have long passed and the mystery of Dungeons and Dragons has passed into legend. These days tabletop gamers meet in the open, exploring dungeons with friends and strangers alike. Lately, however(as of the last fifteen years), the RPG genre has moved online, and as a result, the game has changed entirely. You can only imagine the happiness and joy expressed by old school gamers when Dungeons and Dragons Online was released in February of 2006, even with a subscription fee. Now that the game has gone free to play, players around the world have been given the opportunity to experience Eberron in all its tinkered glory.","March 30, 2015","true","0.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It uses a hub system with various "dungeons" attached. These usually have a set of objectives that needs to be completed, which is hardly ever "kill 20 monsters". In this way, the game becomes quite different from most other MMO's.\n\nA pro and con, is that the game has almost unlimited character customization possibilities and in my opinion no clear, or dominating, "meta" besides potential flavour of the month. I have never been restricted from joining a group for playing an unorthodox build.\nThe character customization can make it complex when starting out, but also fun (or self-torturing) as there are many things to try. Generally DDO has a very friendly community. If you are playing a few hours everyday, then doing your time playing/leveling you will certainly meet the same people more than once.\n\nI am in a love/hate relationship with the controls. At times they feel clunky. But depending on class and playstyle you can easily avoid the otherwise standard "Tab-Target stand-still spell-cast-time" combat style of other MMO's. I suggest you don't get too adventurous with your first character, or those controls might give you a "Morrowind-like" combat. DDO is largely numbers-based. (But but! It can be fun to make your own custom character, don't be afraid! ;))\n\nIf you want something premade, then I suggest googling "DDO build repository". That post might be gone or old by the time you read this, then you should ask for build advice in the new player section of the forums. As I said, the game has a friendly community. Whatever you do, avoid the pre-set class builds when creating your character. They are old and nobody uses them for good reason.\n\nTwo questions I usually see on forums:\n- Are people still playing this game? Yes. The player-base on the servers are quite similar, except Wayfinder. Avoid Wayfinder.\n- Is the game Pay to Win? Or let me rephrase: Can Free to play get along? Short answer: Yes.\nSemi-long: New player builds (see repository) can be made to handle themselves, spend earned in-game currency on adventure packs, and consider spending any minimum amount of real life money on the game to make your account status to premium.","May 10","true","331.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I just added DDO to Steam just long enough to write the review.  I have bought a quarter of  the quest packs for my 3 premium accounts.\n\nDDO is a "Free to Play" MMORPG but if you want to go far into DDO, you Will have to pay real money.  DDO is more Free to Try and Pay to Win. You can grind for favor to earn a small amount of store points on your account, but you would have to work really hard to earn enough just to buy 1 quest pack.  The best way now to play DDO is paid subscription (which is $9.99 a month for a year sub). All the quest packs (except Expansions), most classes, account perks and races are open to subscribers, and you receive 500 store coins each month of VIP.  I suggest you try it out from Steam as Free to Play, then if you really want to pay, go to Turbine DDO website to pay.  You could play as Premium non-subscriber but you will have to buy most of the quest packs just to reach level 20 without grinding and be limited in your choices of avatars.  Expansions will have to be bought separately for level 20 and above content or non-Stormreach content.\n\nDDO is set  in the Dungeons and Dragon universe of Eberron and Forgotten Realms on expansion, and fairly follows the pen and paper game closely.  I liked this game better than the Dungeon and Dragons Neverwinter MMO.  The graphics and controls are good still.  In-game Loot is plentyfull.\n\nThe game like all other game has it's faults but it is better than the other games out there currently still, imho.  Give it a try.\n\nfor more info:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgS8WDsAtG0\n\nhttp://mmohuts.com/game/dungeons-and-dragons-online\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewOtkYlY9eg\n\nhttp://www.mmogames.com/gamereviews/dungeons-dragons-online-review\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WLOLWFNmqs\n\nhttp://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/163/view/reviews\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULE2Z-HWY9o\n\nhttps://www.ddo.com/forums/showthread.php/384483-Why-are-DND-reviews-so-bad?s=4c6b484cec981f479da367a70922ad72\n\nhttp://ddowiki.com/","December 16, 2014","true","170.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(MOST OF THEM)\n7) PLAY YOUR PART be a group if your in a party , why did u join a GROUP if you arent guna play as a GROUP?\n8) Press O to bring up the group panel BUT (***BYOH*** MEANS BRING YOUR OWN HEALS) basickly dont die , bring potions if you are a character that canot heal always have potions for yourself\n9) Dont be stuck in PVP, to be good there u have to get your gear and make your character a PVP PWNER\n10) ENJOY IT!!!!\n\nDDO was the first online game i ever played, I started as soon as it became F2P , i remember the days we were scared to do miserys peak on HARD (*thats the end quest of inro*) now we solo ELITE without blinking, i must have spent £200  on the game in the past 4-5 years about? The only game i ever spent money on BECAUSE it was the only game WORTH spending money on in my eyes.. But when these changes of the skill trees and all that i left, but not because of that but because of the popularity was crushed , i didint play for like 8 mounths, came back and here i am again playing the best MMO(RPG) to ever be shown to gamers but as i explained above for many reasons. I always believed that the First impresion of what u play on no matter what it is will stick with you forever,For me that was DDO , So if u know a newbie gamer who wants to become a GAME DESTROYER then make it a good ... Some of the BEST times of my life are in this game..

Can solo most quests. But if can run with one or more friends, that would be more fun. Or make friends within a guild. Even running with random people (PUG) is usually good if choose carefully.\nPublic areas permit a large number of people (note, not PVP). However the number of people that can enter a specific quest or adventure area is 6 and with raids 12 (special events may have more). That number does include hirelings (and also the not-great owlbear from Shadowfell collectors edition) but excludes summons, companions, pets.\n\nThere are currently about 100 free quests and about 250 quests that are paid (by quest pack or by expansion). There are quite a bit more free quests below level 10 than above level 10. There are also almost 20 raids and around 30 adventure areas and maybe 10 challenges. And some PVP areas that are ignored by almost everyone.\n\nDo need to get packs and expansions? I would say that if enjoy the game then consider doing so. Yes can earn turbine points to buy the packs, but for many that isn't a great use of their time. Note purchase of a pack is for all characters for all servers forever. Or go VIP and have access to all packs. However VIP memberships do NOT include expansions.\n\nOne note on VIP is that it can open up hard and elite difficulty. I find hard difficulty is a great choice for many newer players (and still a very good choice for more experienced non-expert players at higher levels). Note other account types can also open a quest on other difficulties either by completing on a lower difficulty or by a cheap store item (or in the same party with someone that can access the higher difficulties).\n\nEveryone have their own favorite packs. Gianthold pack is argueably the most recommended pack as it has lots of quests at both heroic (13-14) and elite (23-25) levels. Can search for recommend packs. But keep in mind of your play style, the usefulness of the pack and how much you might enjoy the pack. For example, I like bright cheerful explorer areas so picked up the Three barrel cove pack - a pack that is often not recommended.\n\nThe catacombs starter pack isn't too bad. The quests are somewhat interesting (opinions vary of course). As this is a purchase, will automatically bring account to premium status. Note the permenant gold seal hireling is only one per account per server so if don't have shared bank (included with VIP and a recommended option for other account types), so make sure you login to the correct character after you enable that pack. That hireling is useful for those soloing to give you an extra hand to deal with some quests mechanics, and especially with a character that uses spell points as the hireling can restore some spell points back to you. Note must be level 3 minimum to summon that hireling. For a VIP, less benefit. Note can always buy non-permenant gold seal hirelings from the ddo store.\n\nExpansions?\nMenace of underdark is recommended once reach level 16+. If it includes the Attack on Stormreach pack then would be useful earlier (level 13 pack). By level 20, it is highly suggested. (note max level is currently 28, will reach 30 by end of 2014 and unlikely to ever increase beyond that).\nShadowfell expansion - I got it, not thrilled. But as the number of quests at epic levels 26 to 28 is quite low (but growing) so for now could be useful.\n\nCombat is very dynamic, or can be. Can always just stand in front of some monster and whack away. If can kill very quickly or have enough healing or high defense and especially at lower difficulties (casual/normal) and on stupider creatures that can work. But combat often is not like that as can move around, use terrain, dodge attacks and use various tactics. Notice what an opponent is doing / about to do and react to that. e.g. hard to shoot someone with arrows or with a ray spell if the target keeps moving or runs behind a pillar.\n\nGrouping - this game permits characters to reincarnate back to level 1 multiple times. These characters are called TRs. Other people may like to run many different types of charcters (alts). So this means that in a random group you might have one or more that is familiar with the quests and what lies within (note if repeat a quest will notice that does do not vary too much, although difficulty selected will have a significant impact). And they are often equiped somewhat better to way better than a newer character. Although noticeable at low levels, it is very noticable around level 12 for greensteel equiped TRs.\nThese people often just want to complete the quest efficently/quickly (usually on elite) and as they already know the quest, they don't need to investigate or explore. This can give a false impression that a quest is easy and dramatically decrease how long it takes to do the quest (e.g. a few minutes instead of 30+ minutes for a group that isn't familar with the quest). Groups are usually labelled as Elite BB, Zerg or BYOH or similar. Suggest if don't want that type of group to post one yourself saying no zerg or not a speed run or similar.\n\nGraphics, primarly on the older quests can be dated. But it does work fairly well with low end graphic cards. There is also higher quality graphics mostly in forgotten realms that can take full advantage of a high end graphics card. Some people say they prefer the graphics style in DDO over many other mmos, so whatever. Some of the images on the DDO steam page looks like images from a few years ago and is currently is significantly better.\n\nOther notes:\nWhen starting the game, you are immediately in a quest. The whole island has several quests. However keep in mind these are fairly simple quests to show some of the facets of the game. And no, a rogue/artificer is not necessary to do any of the quests (there are a few optional chests and some traps that can be timed). Hiring the level 1 cleric hireling is recommened (costs a few coins). And if your character can cast spells, strongly suggest to take the Archivist's Necklace for the Misery's peak reward.\nEnjoy the journey, don't race to get to the end, many of the most popular quests are at many different levels. And especially true as the end game is being revamped with the level cap increase to 28 a few months ago and then finally to 30 at the end of this year.\n\nRaces. The base races are good.\nFor premium races, Warforge is very popular for wizard and sorcerer (and artificer) due to strong self heal capabilities.\nPurchase of drow is not suggested as it is easy to earn access to the drow in game (only 400 favor to unlock drow for the server).\nHalf orc and half elf, are not too popular as the free human race is usually a better choice. Note half-elf is the ugliest race. Gnomes are not yet available.\nIconics start a character at level 15. Although not too bad for TRs and alts, for most new players I would not suggest starting with an iconic. Some iconics may be included in some versions of the shadowfell expansion.\n\nClasses: The base classes are also good. (although paladin and especially bard are often viewed as weaker choices)\nFor premium classes, Artificer is a considered as a fairly strong choice. It can be gained with favor (not easily...). However for me the repeating crossbow sound was so annoying that switched to different combat style...\nMonk is considered as a strong choice for, especially if like active combat style with lots of buttons and manoeuvring around. Also popular for multiclassing with 2 (or more) levels of monk such as with fighter, cleric, artificer, wizard, etc.\nFavored Soul use to be quite popular, now not so much... maybe when 3rd prestige is available it will be popular again.\nDruid is okayish. Some can get it to work quite well, for me... meh. Might be included if get some versions of the Menance of the underdark expansion.\nDone.","January 10, 2014","true","17.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

It is rather dated, has a few issues once in a while, and lacks some of the quality of life features of some newer MMO's. However, it is a character builder's dream, with the ability to endlessly tinker with various builds and classes and the freedom to build your character however you want, with stats, skills, and feats freely allocated allowing for clever and unique builds for those who want to try something new and impressive optimization for power gamers. The community is by and large decent, and while there are probably a few bad apples, I haven't had any terrible experiences. The game is both solo and party friendly, and the more recalcitrant solo players can bring along hirelings, AI companions, to help out if the going gets tough. Dungeons can be run on four difficulties, a pansy mode for cowardly weaklings, a normal mode for weaklings, a hard mode for regular players, and expert for power builds! (Okay, I generalized there.) There is a lot of content for free, and subscribing unlocks access to most of the content for a monthly fee. Otherwise, you can buy or earn turbine points to get content packs to expand your experience. The cash shop is prevalent and offers advantages, but free to play is sufficient to get a good start in the game and there's not really a crippling disadvantage to free players that would force them to pay.","August 15, 2015","true","865.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well for starters its free. So that should have you downloading as we speak. Well plenty of classes, Build, Skills, Feats, Enhancments, and Quests,and P2P content that will keep you playing for hours. The way you can custimize your charcter is amazing. You can be a self healing monk caster or a fighter cleric its just amazing! I really dont understand why people dont play this. If you havent already or even if you have give it a other try, Its worth :) P.S I played this way more than what it says (Played it without steam) But i will say this with caution. If you dont want to make multiple toons and grind and grind for points or you dont want to buy them. Then this game is not for you. Its a amazing game. But way to much p2p content.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ddepuy632/recommended/206480/","ddepuy632","Rattlehead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ddepuy632/","296 products in account","DDO is probably the most underratred MMO out there. I wish more games in the genre would use modular content like this one does. It allows you to solo and make groups on the fly while still enjoying the content, and you never feel like you have to twiddle your thumbs waiting for a "healer" or "tank" to show up. It's an altogether better system than the traditional MMO in many ways.\n\nThe free account is limited in that you can only create two characters and they will be removed if you don't log on for a while - which makes me sad, because I really play this as kind of a pick-up-and-go game and I don't like to pay subscription fees for MMOs. That said, the game itself is definitely worth your time if you're looking for a free to play MMORPG that actually has some depth to it.\n\nIt can be difficult to find other players to group with because the player base is small. It's still a very enjoyable game, and if you're even vaguely familiar with D&D 3.5 rules you'll get into it pretty easily. I only know the very basic gameplay and I was able to jump into this without too many issues. The leveling system is more complex and robust than a typical mmo, but the game has features that allow you to select a goal. The game then builds toward that goal for you. It's a fun game to play causally. I would play more often if I had a regular group to play with.","May 3, 2014","true","34.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's graphics and combat give it a classic feel, and even though it looks old, it is updated regularly and has a large amount of players. The quests and dungeons are interesting and immersive.\nThere are large "Wilderness" areas filled with monsters and places to explore, and they even have a few rare named monsters! The dungeons are exceedingly fun, with many different monsters and 4 different difficulty settings that effect XP earned. Choose Casual and go through it lone wolf, or go Elite and bring a few friends along to conquer all those who oppose you! Grouping in this game is fun, as you learn to depend on one-another when in danger.\n\nThe crafting system is a little boring, but it is absolutely rewarding. Armor and Weapon designs are cool and flashy, with multiple different armor sets for diversity.\n\nCombat is fun, with weapons having hitboxes and a certain reach based on their weapon type. There are somewhere around 15 classes, all of which are interesting and fun to play. The game features a multiclass system, so you can make your character exactly what you want it to be. Whether you're a mage with a huge greataxe, a stealthy tank, or a magical rogue, whatever you want to be is entirely up to you.\n\n9/10, You must try this game.","April 28, 2014","true","26.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeyChildren/recommended/206480/","HeyChildren","HeyChildren [Printers]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeyChildren/","50 products in account","Verdict: RECOMMENDED\n\nBefore we get into this review, I have at least over 3000+ hours on this game, I have been playing it for 7 years I don't use the Steam version often. Oh and hey to anyone who knows Gonnakillu, Scottyj and my 17 other toons from Argonneson (add me if you do <3)\n\nThe actual combat system is definitely one of the best I have used in MMO's I have played my fair share of MMO's and in my opinion the combat system/engine in this game tops all of them, for a game that was released in 2006 (I think) it has a really advanced combat system and I would call it advanced for games today.\n\nTo actually have fun with this game you do not even have to have friends playing with you as there is a great group engine which allows everyone around the world to be connected together and play with eachother, you can mark yourself as LFG (Looking For Group). The game is also fun while soloing through quests but you can also have support from hirelings, which is an friendly AI which you purchase to hire for an hour (time doesn't go on whilst not in quests/wildernesses). Speaking of the AI's, although they are sterotyped to be stupid as a pinecone they are actually very useful to have at times and they're very well developed.\n\nFor classes/races there are so many options to pick, I think there are a total of 14 classes, but that can change at anytime because Turbine are always updating the game with new classes/races, I also think there is a total of 14 races now that they've added in Gnomes, unforunately I haven't been on to see this yet. The race you pick can also effect your class stability and changes your stats such as Charisma, Wisdom, Strength, for example a Halfling will have decreased Strength and a Drow will have decreased Intelligence, this is also a very good system that stops very over powered builds coming in game.\n\nThe servers itself are very good, I do not ever experience lag, whenever I do it is on my end, there are not many maintenances that occur.\n\nThe game is F2P but after a certain level lets say, 12 it is very hard to progress without some adventure packs and you will find yourself grinding the same quest a lot, VIP is quite cheap for a monthly subscription, but you can also just buy the adventure packs individually and in your own time. If you are P2P'ing you will have a better time with the game as you will not have to ransack every F2P quest out there as a lot of adventure packs are added frequently that you will have access to once released (as a VIP) You can also either the races/classes or get them for free with VIP, but you can also earn the in-game without implementing a single penny into the game via favor which you earn with every quest you complete, the amount of favor points you get is increased if you do the quest on a higher difficulty (please note there is a lot of F2P classes/races but there is a lot of P2P classes/races as well).\n\nThis game can also be used to make a lot of friends which could lead you into a high level guild which makes the whole experience a lot better and more fun. Your guild you have joined or created can also get an airship, you may unlock the first airship at level 20 (guild level) I believe and you will start to unlock better airships gradually when you increase your guild level, these airships can be brought by in game currency (platinum, gold, silver, cooper etc) or Turbine Points. These airships aren't just there for design though, they are able to have buffs on then which increase your stats which are very useful especially when going on high level raids.\n\nThe PvP feature is outstanding, I guilty enough, have spent most of my hours in the PvP areas which are normally located in taverns, the most populated one being the Wayward Lobster in Harbor. Although in my server it isn't as populated as it used to be once be (the good ol' days :'( ) it is still a fun feature which you can mess around with friends with, there are also game modes such as capture the flag and all of that shenanigans but I am not sure if it is working shape as I haven't heard of it for a while.\n\nThe character creation is an extraodinary engine, it has many options to pick with which can be used ot make a already built build (highly recommended for new players) or a custom build which you can decide where your points go and what spells you decide on. You can even choose your own aliginment (not sure if spelt right) In the past couple of years they've implemented a lot of good features such as new skill trees, epic feats, epic destinies etc and this has changed the game a lot as there is so much more to do. This game, in my opinion, has the best charactor creation engine out there.\n\nIf you decide to buy VIP right off the hook make sure you DO NOT start an iconic character straight away as this will take you to level 15 and as a newbie you will be absolutely crushed in quests (that is if you know how to get to quests by that point) make sure you try one of the beginner classes and start off slow and get the drift of the game first, get a character to level 1-15 instead of skipping the levels.\n\nAn outstanding feature is True Reincarnation which can be used at level 20 to set you back to level 1 but it will be like you are creating a whole new character as you can pick a whole new race and class but it will be a lot more stronger, powerful and it will give you a lot more options, if you true reincarnate again you will be stronger and more powerful than your 2nd life, after your 3rd life you will have one more boost your points you can add onto your stats etc until it will stay the same and if you do one life on every class you will get a feat that will stick onto you forever called "Completionist" this drasticlly improves your stats etc,  although this will take a lot years to do, I know a few people myself who has done it, I myself have a family member who has done it.\n\nThe community in the game is great, but they're also some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on there, but hey this is the Internet it is a normal occurance, most of the community are completely chilled and good people and are willing to be your friend have group with you to complete quests together and the community 9/10 helps you out, hey, I had someone give me 100k plat to my brother who was starting out at the time.\n\nI will probably add more to this tomorrow\n\nOh and Turbine, update your steam homepage and use it more and fix the purchases on steam, anyone who thinks they are going to purchase in game do not download on steam as it is broken, download here https://signup.ddo.com/ddo.php?ftui=DDOBlackDragon&abrs=100_1457230160","September 1, 2015","true","44.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a game I play all summer, every summer, and it brings that happy kid feeling back into me. This game is so nostalgic. I love the leveling system and how you can set up parties to play with others. This game has so much in it, I can play for 12 hours straight, wake up, and start playing. Everyone who likes leveling up, picking cool spells, or enchanting weapons like Greatswords or Longbows should give this game a try. I suggest playing to at least level 4. If you don't buy a subscription though, I think the standard cap is either 8, 10, or 12.

It's a really great game honestly and I love it. The creators are still supporting in and releasing updates and it's pretty awesome. However it's player base has started to dwindle and that is hurting it a lot. It was never what you could call high profile but it did have a crap ton of players on it. But now it can be hard to find others. It's possible to get around this if you know what to look for though. First of all, play during the day, esp. on weekends and there will be a good number of people around. Second of all, be careful what server you pick as characters can't move between them. To get around this I suggest using Argonnessen (you might have to scroll to find it). It has a really active player community still and there are a lot of guilds looking for players. Third, JOIN A GUILD PLEASE, just do it, if you are having a hard time finding people that's probably because you aren't in one. It helps, a lot, it really does. As far as finding one goes, hang around the harbor or korthos island (after you kill the dragon, you can't join one before that) and someone will probably try and recruit you to their guild. I know a guild (not mine, I founded my own a while ago and try and keep it kind of small) called Tycoons of Tommorow has been really active lately as well as really into recruiting, so they would be a good choice. Fourth, if a guild isn't helping or your fellow members aren't logged in, use the social pannel. It's there for a reason. It's made to show you all parties looking for members to do a quest. If you want to do a quest that isn't on that list, create your own looking for members party (the tool to do so is also in the social pannel). On the issue of FTP, that lasts for about 7 to 8 levels (that's a lot more than you think, you have to rank up 5 times per level and ranking up is a lot like what leveling is in another game) so you can still get some play time in before you run in to that really badly. HOWEVER, remember this is a bussiness, the company has to make money otherwise they can't have a game so eventually they need you to buy something. Don't get upset about this if you don't want to pay, go play flash games or something online it doesn't really matter. If you are willing to get over that, be willing to pay a little, you can get a subscription or buy individual content. I suggest buying the individual content which you do through the in game store, it's not too expensive and it never expires so it's a lot like buying DLC content for another game. Next DON'T expect this to be the pen and pencil game. It's different, HOWEVER, it really did inherit the heart and soul of D&D. Character building is almost strait out of D&D 3.5 edition and is very (almost deceptively) complex. It's easy to mess up so read a couple tutorials or pick a default build. Whatever you do, don't play the wizard, pick sorcerer, they do everything better and both are free. Wizards just really suck on non-reencarated builds. For beginners I suggest picking the Barbarian or Paladin classes. Both are really good and easy to play (Paladins just got an update and are stupidly powerful right now, I would go with a Human or Dwarf Paladin). Player abilities take a little ispiration from 4.0 (good things not all the terribleness) so that you don't have to make a lot of basic attacks and it's really intuitive. Quests are also really nice as long as you aren't too concerned with your exp. per minute (which honestly just takes the fun out of the game). Take your time and read and listen to the stories, they are pretty great. And lastly just have fun with it. It's free at first so it doesn't hurt at all to try. So come on and play, If you are on Agronnessen and you see a character with the surname Requiem, say hi, I'll see if I can't help you get started.","November 9, 2014","true","427.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Despite how it sounds, it's actually very pleasing. Overall gameplay experiences are positive and it's not bad on the eye either. DDO brings outstanding events (mabar, crystal cove, etc.), and I found these to be extremely rewarding.\n\nHowever, I'm kind of sad to see DDO becoming less and less D&D in an attempt to please a more mainstream crowd. I greatly enjoyed playing it over the past years, but I find myself playing less for exactly that reason. Every update comes with it's own set of new bugs and support is sloppy. Every update seems to make the game more profit oriented, the gaming experience coming in second place. And I'll admit, I have spent my fair share of money, with no regrets.\n\nPROs:\n- Hours of fun. Find yourself a capable, well balanced party and you'll be having a good time.\n- A variety of different locations, each with their own inhabitants, all equally eager to knock you down a peg.\n- A very supportive community\n\nCONs\n- After hours of gameplay, going from TR to TR becomes quite a grind.\n- "Incompetent" (By lack of a better word) parties will prolong a quest greatly. This is not always a problem, but can be quite aggrevating when it takes 3 hours to complete a seemingly simple raid.\n- Bugs and poor fixes.\n- Quest mechanics have been changed, making it next to impossible to do a quest solo.\n\nTL;DR\nDDO is still good, it just used to be better.","January 1, 2015","true","493.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Do not think of this game as free to play. You "Could" get every piece of content in the game for free, but it is highly time inefficient and soul-suckingly boring for the average person. requiring roughly 20 hours to get 1000 Turbine points (the Shop currency) also known as 10$.\n\n2. Since I have asked you to suspend your current beliefs I will supply you with some new ones. This game should be thought of as a 25$ game when on one of their deep discount sales on steam for christmas (mabye), black friday, or any other sale where you can pick up the two expansions, or a 15$ a month Subscription with free premium currency as mini rewards as you play. Remember that you can buy most adventure packs for $3 to $10 with a few exceptions. You also do not have to buy all of the packs. some can be ignored because they are not your cup of tea.\n\n3. Sales. Learn them.

I mostly play solo, so my review will be based primarily on that. Even though this game is over 8 years old, the graphics still look very nice. The dungeons and enemy designs are very well done. Its definitely a dungeon crawler. You will not be riding horses around the countryside thats for sure. I enjoy being able to hire a mercenary and summon a combat pet to help you with your solo group. Experience points are only given upon completion of the dungeon quest and not on each enemy killed. The only drawback is that you have to complete the dungeon in one sitting and some of the dungeons are very long and complicated. I started free to play and then i purchased Menace of the Underdark expansion pack during a Steam sale for $8.75 and it upgraded my account to premium. It was a fantastic buy.

You wan't this game to be so good but the bugs constantly slap your immersion right in the face.\n\nWould i wan't the hours i played back, no. Do i wan't the game to improve yes.\n\nIf you have ever played pen & paper like i did, this is a easy to digest version somewhat of the old d & d games. But it plays like an mmo of course. Theres starting to be a large variety of classes now to melt into eachother with reckless abandon. Some builds are extremely good and some are very gimped.\n\nIt takes the action based approach to a really cool place, which i really like. But that said some of its features are lacking in the sense that it's crafting system never fully matured.\n\nThe large raids require a large amount of guidance, and can fail badly and quickly because of large amounts of dammage  huge demands to mana. They removed monks ability to ressurect people which was a huge boon and needed in my opinion.\n\nSmall pets that do nothing, no mounts and no housing. Those are things id like to see in the future. And the really cool story based dungeons could lift the game somewhat, with not to much downtime mind you, it sucks to wait for minutes just looking at narration.\n\nWell if you are new to the game and are looking for a guild, im on sarlona with my own guild Nobles of Evenstar.","December 19, 2014","true","879.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/friimynd/recommended/206480/","friimynd","friimynd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/friimynd/","53 products in account","Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game.\nI have played it for years and both love and hate it.\nMany times have I deleted all my characters and vowed never to return to it.\nMany times have I relented and given it another go.\nEach time the conviction becomes stronger to leave it alone.\nFinally, I have decided to play one last time, this time not to delete.  I will be playing a warforged sorcerer, for the heals and the burst dps.  I'll be focusing on the conjuration school of magic for my feats, to improve the DC of the spells so they aren't resisted as easily and saved against, such as when the mob takes half or no damage.  I believe the conjuration school is the one with the most damage spells, if not then whichever school.  No metamagic feats, except maybe heighten, for bosses.  Having many spell points means not having to use only spell-like abilities, where metamagic feats have no cost.  At least that is the theory.  Another option would be warforged wizard, but i'm just not thrilled by the wizard skill tree, and its poor showing of SLA's.  Another option would be maximize and the other damage boosting feat with a sorcerer tree, but then you can't cast any other damaging spells without turning off the feats, which is not a big deal, but you lose the feats you would have used for the improved DC (difficulty c-something).\n.\nAnd that brings us to the reason I think this game is broken.  TR, or True Reincarnation.\nFor whatever reason, they chose to give you the option of reincarnating as a level 1 again but with a bonus feat and a couple of bonus stat points, and maybe something else.  I think it is total bs.  There are those who have done it a thousand times and are so far beyond the 'noob' who is on his 'first life' it is really quite pathetic.  And to expect any new player to embrace this concept and desire to play this way is even more pathetic.  It is really very embarrassing.  I'm almost embarrassed to be playing it at all, but I have such a history with the game that it just felt right to have a presence in it, with at least one character.\n.\nWill I eventually reincarnate and play again, with either the same class/race or some other?  I don't know.  I doubt I will ever get to level 20.  I doubt the game will last much longer.  Somehow there is a devoted subscriber base that pays for at least one developer who regularly cranks out some sort of updates that I really never get to play, having always deleted my characters before getting to that level.\n.\nThere is one benefit to reincarnating, for a f2p player like me, which is the ability to start new quests on hard or elite, on your 2nd and 3rd lives, respectively.  I don't really see it as a benefit, but the developer got to eat so they have to gimp the f2p/freemium player somehow.\n.\nThe alternative is to subscribe, for maybe a month, maybe more, depending on your bent.  I have taken a no-subscribe vow for all games, since quitting wow.  I subscribed for a month to ddo, but they charged me for 2 months, and I didn't even keep playing, it just got so lame running behind the 'ubers' trying to keep up.  But it turns out this is really every game.  Bunch of ubers admiring each other.  Back-slapping society.  The difference is that in DDO you start over at level 1 every 20 levels.  You can continue to the 'epic' levels now, but who would do that?  You will always be lacking the reincarnation feats other characters have accrued.\n.\nSome people will say, 'well, that is the game, what's not to like?'.  And I say, be nicer to your fremium players.  Don't be so exclusive.  Don't be so elitist.  Make your game inviting to all, not just a few who fall for the line you are playing out.\n.\nI've purchased nearly every questpack the game has, except for a couple of the newest ones that are very high level anyway, so I probably will never play them.  This is stupid if I ever subscribe, even for a month.  So, I will play my punk-♥♥♥ warforged sorcerer and do the quests solo, and maybe reincarnate, if I ever get there.  I was going to play a halfling sorcerer or something equally pathetic, but everyone just says, 'why aren't you a warforged?'.  As I said, broken game.  I could play any other character, of whatever 'build' is recommended, but I like the sorcerer.  Actually, I mostly just don't like the other classes, with their stick swinging whackwhackwhack nonsense all the damn time.\n.\nSo, I will see you in the game, maybe, though not with this name, lol.  Or, perhaps you will understand my reasoning and stay away.  For the most part, I will be staying away, but sometimes, just for the memories, I will come back to it, run a quest, deconstruct some items, polish my whatever item, and feel the nostalgia.  Cheers to a dead game, DDO, how ever much longer it takes for it to realize that and quit trying to reincarnate.\n.\nglhf","May 17, 2015","false","159.5"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","1"

Throw that in with their "too many enemies notice you so you are slowed down", attack penalties, movement penalties, etc, until you kill half of them off.\n\nWhile also in Wheloon prison, Shadar-kai Assassins can just spam their AoE weapon that slows, reduces attack speed, attack damage, etc, etc and stacks up to 8 times causing nothing challenging, just a pain in the ♥♥♥ of a grind fest.

I have been playing this game for 4 years prior to accessing through Steam.\n\nThis game is what a good Action RPG should be.  It has almost infinite replayability!\n\nCharacters aka "Toons" - with 8 regular races, 4 Iconic races and 13 classes......the combinations are endless.  Each class has multiple ways to build them and with multi-classing, the tweaking never stops.  This is the biggest strength of the game in my opinion.  Add in the Epic Destinies in the later levels and customization continues to increase.  Each Resurrection adds a "Past Life" bonus which keeps you grinding for more.\n\nContent - There are tons of quests! A large amount of them are set in the Realm of Eberron.  A couple of years ago they expanded to include the Forgotten Realms (Eveningstar, Underdark, etc.).  The content includes Wilderness areas, Quests and Raids.  There are a large diversity in quests with puzzles sprinkled through out.  The difficulty is adjustable in each case.\n\nFree-to-play - When reading reviews of MMOs, this seems to be one of the biggest factors for people liking or disliking the game.  Is this game Free-to-play?  Yes, it is.  You can unlock everything in the game for free......with a good amount of grinding.   It is possible to play totally free by earning Turbine Points (TP) for completing quests.  TP is the DDO Store currency for purchasing Quest packs, cosmetics, specialty potions, etc.  Is there the opportunity to pay real money for advantages?  Yes, there are.   You can purchase TP with real money.  There are also upgrades to purchase for you character like ability and skill tomes.  So technically you can advance yourself by spending some real money, however the only way to get the great gear in the game is by grinding for it.  I played 2 years for free before finally going VIP cause I love the game so much and thought, why not....this is where I spend most of my time.\n\nCommunity - The community is largely made up of older people, reliving the days of PnP online in video game format.  Guilds are a good way to meet people and also gain some help.  There are opportunities for roleplaying if you find the right people.  The majority of players are good people if you are willing to learn the right way to play.... that means listening to those who know what they are doing, sticking to the plan and playing within your limits.  There are lots of resources for help online\n\nI have enjoyed this game for a long while and will continue to do so as long as the updates keep rolling in","May 15, 2015","true","632.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yeah that has only been since it got on Steam.\n\nYes the graphics are dated and some of the base D&D mechanics are creaking under the weight of all the add-ons done over the years. Most of the problems with mechanics tend to show up at the upper level ranges (20+)\n\nMany of the recent adjustments to classes has taken some of the difficulty edge off of the lower levels as power creep has reared its head.\n-----------\n\nFor the absolute best DDO experience:\nget 3-4-5 friends that have zero experience playing. Have everyone go through the tutorial (it is solo only).\nSet up a schedule of play time and request that no one plays at all outside of the group time, no spoilers!\nDont go read about how best to play the game or the best builds , etc.\nThe exploration and learning on your own when it is all fresh to the whole crew is priceless.\n\nSome dungeons have you thinking with your fighter ,barbarian or sorcerer you are the baddest MoFo ever.\nNext dungeon you are cheering on the rogue who is sneaking around a room full of big, bad Ogres, that would squash him in no time flat if they see him/her, picking up the soul stones(dead PCs) of the entire party to take them back to the shrine to be raised from the dead.\n\n===========================\nLots to do as free to play so no need to pull out the CC right away.\nIf you follow the above plan for best experience by time you get to where you feel the 'need' to pay, you will gladly be screaming "take my money, now!"\n\n-----------------------\nOne word of caution about making characters;\nMany of the older dungeons have the unfortunate MMO min/maxer design problem.\nYou will run in to somethings that require X Strength score to open or Y skill points to trick an NPC will seem really high.\nThe desiginers couldn't make the stat requirements too low where a balanced character could complete with out making things trivial for the min/maxers.\n\nJust keep that in mind when building that maxing or nearly maxing your primary ability scores is suggested and likewise it is better to have a few skills that are maxed rather than a bunch of skills with low investment.\n~~~~~~~~","September 18, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm a age-old D&D fan, and the flexibility of this game to make the character you want, change classes, vary weapons, etc... it's just awesome.  The dungeons and combats are much more unique than most other MMO's I've played (still not as great as solo games where you are the center of the universe)... but hey, you can play it with friends which is cool.  I was worried about the reviews, expecially the costs... but some of the posts are dated and no longer accurate.  For instance, it doesn't cost any $ to level up.  I'm now about level 8, and finally blew $35 on the game and don't really plan on spending more... that might mean I top out and don't get to the highest levels, but I don't plan on playing more than a year.

The game play is pretty easy to figure out, even for someone who knew absolutely nothing of how to use any of the inventory items or how to do any moves.

The dungeons and combats are much more unique than most other MMO's I've played (still not as great as solo games where you are the center of the universe)... but hey, you can play it with friends which is cool.  I was worried about the reviews, expecially the costs... but some of the posts are dated and no longer accurate.  For instance, it doesn't cost any $ to level up.  I'm now about level 8, and finally blew $35 on the game and don't really plan on spending more... that might mean I top out and don't get to the highest levels, but I don't plan on playing more than a year.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirune/recommended/206480/","zirune","zirune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirune/","992 products in account","Dungeons & Dragons Online (DDO) plays sort of like a hack-and-slash game as opposed to a more turn-based ability-heavy MMO like WoW. You control your character with WASD as per the norm, with things like blocking and rolling available. Attacking is done by holding down the left mouse button, and items, abilities, and spells are used with whatever you decide to use them with, the default being the 1-0 number keys. Everything's in real time, though some spells, abilities, and other things can take a little while to cast.\n\nEasily the strongest part of DDO (and D&D) is the character customization. Want to make a melee mage? Go for it! Want to put some different caster in your caster, so you can cast while you cast? It'll be horribly gimpy, but go for it! Aside from alignment restrictions (Barbarians and Bards can't be Lawful, Monks must be Lawful, Paladins must be Lawful Good, Druids have to be Neutral) and the fact that you can't be an evil alignment, you can do whatever you want. Generally, any character you build (unless you want a 19 Barbarian/1 Wizard to cast spells offensively or something else silly like that) can get through quests fine if you play, gear, etc. well, though some will obviously struggle, and it'll likely be very difficult to play through higher difficulties and raids with a gimpy character. You also might get weird looks in parties, and perhaps even some rejections, but making your own party for like-minded people is easy.\n\nIt should be noted, though, that DDO works significantly differently than D&D, and many of the things in D&D (horseback riding, climbing, spell slots, multiple attacks per round, etc.) had to be changed. You don't have a set number of spells per day; there is instead a mana system, though the mana doesn't recharge on its own and you need to use a rest shrine (in place of resting anywhere with the possibility of being ambushed in D&D) or extremely rare potions to restore it. Casters can cast a lot more spells than in D&D, and since this was one of the main drawbacks of casters in D&D, casters tend to be more powerful than melees in DDO for large portions of the game. A lot of skills in D&D (horseback, crafting, tumbling, probably most of them, actually) had to be changed significantly or removed to fit into DDO. Numbers in generally are significantly inflated in DDO (to help fit the real-time combat so you don't just die instantly when beset by two kobolds at level 1), so don't be surprised to see people getting 1k or more HP by level 28.\n\nThe game world is completely instanced; instead of running about vast landscapes (though there are some of those, I'll go over them in the next paragraph) like other MMOs, you talk to NPCs to take quests, then go to the entrance of the quests and are whisked away to wherever the quest is in an instance that is completely separate from everything else in the world and only you and your party can enter. There are currently close to 400 quests, each with their own different dungeons (though some use the same dungeon in a slightly different way), and each quest has its own objectives that you must complete in order to finish it. Most of the quests are generally fairly static (as in not random), though almost all of them have optional objectives, secret areas, and things like that. Some of them have multiple ways to reach the end and some have multiple ways to finish the quest, though for the most part there's a clearly defined objective and one or a few different ways to get there. Quests are generally available in 4 difficulties (Casual, Normal, Hard, Elite), though some aren't. Raids, for instance, don't have a Casual difficulty.\n\nSpeaking of raids, there are currently 17 of them, ranging from level 6 to level 24. They're all fairly unique, though I don't have enough MMO experience to be able to compare them to other games. Some of them are rarely ran, though if you're patient or have friends/guildmates you can do any of them.\n\nThere also exists things called Challenges. These are timed pseudo-quests, where you have a certain objective you must complete in order to complete the challenge, and then 5 optional objectives that give you a higher score and more rewards.\n\nThere are also Explorer Areas, which are more traditional MMO areas that are open and have various things to do and explore inside them. They have XP rewards for finding certain areas, killing monsters, and killing rare monsters, and often house the entrances to quests.\n\nIn terms of endgame, at this moment, there isn't much. You can True Reincarnate your character, which recreates it at a lower level with some benefits (mostly passive things, though there are active ones). If you go from level 20 back to level 1 (there's also an option to go from 28 to 20) with this, you can create a completely brand new character of any class and race, though some things (like your name) remain the same. Other than that, there are currently no raids at the level cap (though there are many below it), so I would avoid blowing through everything to get to the level cap, and instead go slowly, play all kinds of characters, and try out all the content. This will hopefully change in the near future, as the plans are to increase the level cap to 30 and stay there to develop an end-game.\n\nThe community is relatively small, but still quite active. Finding groups can be a challenge, but if you create your own you'll most often at least get a few other people to come along. Even if you can't find people, soloing is very much doable for almost all of the game's content (though some will be extremely difficult or require you to use and abuse certain things to finish), even including some of the game's raids. There are also hirelings, which are NPCs you can buy and bring with you into dungeons. These are mostly useful for healing, either for yourself or to keep critical NPCs alive in quests, though the other hirelings can be useful. The game scales its difficulty based on your group size and composition, sometimes to a fault; it can sometimes be harder to do something in a group than by yourself.\n\nAs far as content restrictions for free players, they're not too terrible. There are more details on this topic here: http://ddowiki.com/page/Account_comparisons. There are about 120 free quests (see here: http://ddowiki.com/page/Guide_to_Free_to_Play) and challenges can be played once per day per character for free. 4 of the game's 8 races are free to play, though one of them (Drow) is easily unlocked through play. 9 of the game's 13 classes are free as well, with 2 unlockable through play (though both of them require you to unlock/buy plenty of quests to do so). In addition, completing quests and challenges will earn you Turbine Points (TP) over time which can be used to unlock quests, classes, races, extra benefits like starting characters at level 4, or various consumable and cosmetic items. It's certainly more stingy than more recent F2P games like Path of Exile where most things or even everything is given to players for free and only cosmetics can be bought, but it's not an unreasonable system.\n\nOn the whole, I'd recommend anybody at least give DDO a try (after all, it is free to play). It's certainly not for everyone, and there are issues abound, probably more than most big MMOs, but it can be a lot of fun. Don't be put off by the early questing, too; a lot of the early quests are sort of samey, featuring the same enemy and environment types. It's not until level 3-5 quests (depending on what you have available) that they start to get really interesting and unique.","January 12, 2014","true","943.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some of them have multiple ways to reach the end and some have multiple ways to finish the quest, though for the most part there's a clearly defined objective and one or a few different ways to get there. Quests are generally available in 4 difficulties (Casual, Normal, Hard, Elite), though some aren't. Raids, for instance, don't have a Casual difficulty.\n\nSpeaking of raids, there are currently 17 of them, ranging from level 6 to level 24. They're all fairly unique, though I don't have enough MMO experience to be able to compare them to other games. Some of them are rarely ran, though if you're patient or have friends/guildmates you can do any of them.\n\nThere also exists things called Challenges. These are timed pseudo-quests, where you have a certain objective you must complete in order to complete the challenge, and then 5 optional objectives that give you a higher score and more rewards.\n\nThere are also Explorer Areas, which are more traditional MMO areas that are open and have various things to do and explore inside them. They have XP rewards for finding certain areas, killing monsters, and killing rare monsters, and often house the entrances to quests.\n\nIn terms of endgame, at this moment, there isn't much. You can True Reincarnate your character, which recreates it at a lower level with some benefits (mostly passive things, though there are active ones). If you go from level 20 back to level 1 (there's also an option to go from 28 to 20) with this, you can create a completely brand new character of any class and race, though some things (like your name) remain the same. Other than that, there are currently no raids at the level cap (though there are many below it), so I would avoid blowing through everything to get to the level cap, and instead go slowly, play all kinds of characters, and try out all the content. This will hopefully change in the near future, as the plans are to increase the level cap to 30 and stay there to develop an end-game.\n\nThe community is relatively small, but still quite active. Finding groups can be a challenge, but if you create your own you'll most often at least get a few other people to come along. Even if you can't find people, soloing is very much doable for almost all of the game's content (though some will be extremely difficult or require you to use and abuse certain things to finish), even including some of the game's raids. There are also hirelings, which are NPCs you can buy and bring with you into dungeons. These are mostly useful for healing, either for yourself or to keep critical NPCs alive in quests, though the other hirelings can be useful. The game scales its difficulty based on your group size and composition, sometimes to a fault; it can sometimes be harder to do something in a group than by yourself.\n\nAs far as content restrictions for free players, they're not too terrible. There are more details on this topic here: http://ddowiki.com/page/Account_comparisons. There are about 120 free quests (see here: http://ddowiki.com/page/Guide_to_Free_to_Play) and challenges can be played once per day per character for free. 4 of the game's 8 races are free to play, though one of them (Drow) is easily unlocked through play. 9 of the game's 13 classes are free as well, with 2 unlockable through play (though both of them require you to unlock/buy plenty of quests to do so). In addition, completing quests and challenges will earn you Turbine Points (TP) over time which can be used to unlock quests, classes, races, extra benefits like starting characters at level 4, or various consumable and cosmetic items. It's certainly more stingy than more recent F2P games like Path of Exile where most things or even everything is given to players for free and only cosmetics can be bought, but it's not an unreasonable system.\n\nOn the whole, I'd recommend anybody at least give DDO a try (after all, it is free to play). It's certainly not for everyone, and there are issues abound, probably more than most big MMOs, but it can be a lot of fun. Don't be put off by the early questing, too; a lot of the early quests are sort of samey, featuring the same enemy and environment types. It's not until level 3-5 quests (depending on what you have available) that they start to get really interesting and unique.","January 12, 2014","true","943.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've recently come back to DDO and reactivated my VIP subscription.  After a few days I was wondering why I ever left.  I even convinced some friends to come back and enjoy the game with me.  Then I tried to purchase some turbine points and my day really great.  Opening up the store I navigated through to purchase some coins and made sure there was enough in my steam wallet to afford it.  I don't get paid till Friday, but $20 isn't bad and it's fun.  So, once I get all that set up I click to purchase the points and...error.  No problem these things happen and there's downtime soon anyway.  I'll just try again afterwards.\n\nDowntime is over, DDO is back up and now I log in to complete my purchase and get to playing.  Error.  Ok, so maybe I just can't use the steam wallet option.  No worries, I still have $25 in that account I'll just use my card.  So I type in my card info, choose the points I want and confirm.  Error.  Can't purchase the points.  Well, now I'm annoyed, but I'm not gonna let that get in my way.  I know I can go to the site, use the store there to but a code for the coins and input that at my account page.  It's not as handy, but it'll work.\n\nAlright, got everything set up, found the points in the store on the site, it get 50 fewer points for the same price going this route.  But at this point I just want to get things taken care of so I can get back to playing.  So I purchase the points, get the code and head over to my account page.  Seems simple, click a button input the code and here come my points.  or....Error...really?  The code isn't valid?  I bought it 5 minutes ago, I have the page still up, I've got a confirmation email.  I'll go see if perhaps it hasn't charged my card yet.\n\nLog into the bank and....wait...overdrafted.  Hmm...oh look I was charged for both the code I bought on the site that is invalid as well as the purchase I tried to make with my card through the store that gave me an error and told me it couldn't be completed.  Ok, so now I've moved money to my steam wallet, been charged twice from my bank account, and now we can add an overdraft charge...and I still don't have my turbine points.  What a fin day of gaming, so glad this is how I spent my day off.\n\nDo yourself a favor, stay away from trying to support this game though purchases.  If you want to play for free, it's fine.  The game play holds up well.  But until they manage to fix the terrible system they use for purchases, just stay away.","October 28, 2015","false","217.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yeah... you get the idea.\n\nThis is a pretty well made rpg game. It's got all the aspects that an rpg should have(including F2p and a premium subcriber service). Yeah kinda peeved at that because like 75% of the content ingame is P2P and the F2P stuff get's kinda boring after you grind in them for 100000000000000+ hours. Also the launcher is a little annoying on the update system as it downloads a lot of stuff if your not on for a month or something like that.\n\nNot trying to hate on the game, it has some great things like clever item systems with multiple slot enchantments and items(doesnt sound like any other rpg game...). Fun quests(for the first time you play them). and a lot of zones(Which will take you years to reach because your too underleveled).\n\nOk let's get specific. At the start of your game you get to create a character. First off some of the races and classes are locked because you need a premium account to use them. and the only decent looking character i could make was human(granted I always play human, but other games really built a solid image of what else should look like and DDO kinda breaks it). Second It takes forever to level up. They have a rank system where like every 5 ranks you level up, so in reality level 2 is more like level 10 and getting levels only come from a massive amount of grinding. So be warned rushers who expect to get final level in the like the first week of the game. Commit to the game and you might actually get the level 3 in a month. In the starter areas you get a lot of the story, but after, it just gets harder and harder to find all the details. As you continue there is less and less voice acting and dialogue in the quests. And the quests, Quests are dungeon based so you cant's just enter and leave them freely, so it is kinda annoying and takes a lot of your time to complete. If you do leave you get an XP penalty or something like that. And since there are so few F2p quests/dungeons you have to keep regrinding them to get XP.\n\nThe combat is pretty fun, different enemy types have different resistances and slimes even break weapons faster. Item decay is something you have to worry about. you can fix them or just ignore them until your UBER GREATSWORD +7123 breaks because you were too lazy to unequip to fight a blob of jello. Combat animations were pretty cool, but got pretty silly after a while. There are always specific weapons that restricted like foreign weapons that your character needs to have a certain loadout to use and skillpoints gained on every rank to advance your character skill tree, except it get's really confusing especially if you multi-class with like 6 different skill trees and only like 2 points to spend. The abilites are easy to use if you know how to use hot-keys.\n\nNow onto the life of a subscriber. If your willing to put in the money, it can be a really fun experience, you get more Xp special areas and quests that are completely restricted to the "F2p Peaseants"(A.K.A 97% of the earth's population). you get easier access to pets, guilds, items, and cosmetic stuff. Only after you dump your life savings into the game on a monthly basis though, So go be the 3% and get the right to say that you did spend hundreds of $$$ on a fake game.\n\nSo to sum it up, either be a commited and persistent person and spend the rest of your life trying to reach level 10 or go be a premium member and do a life's work in 10 minutes with the power of cash and P2W Psychology.\n\n4/10 would grind for days again","February 1, 2015","false","59.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Watch for the great sales here on Steam for the various expansions - I got BOTH Menace of the Underdark and The Shadowfell Conspiracy for less than $10 total.  I've got 200+ hours in-game as of the writing of this review.\n\nIt doesn't have to be stated that Dungeons & Dragons set the stage for all role-playing games to follow... I was there when it first started with pen & paper, that red boxed starter kit & those amazing Monster manuals(not to mention the awesomely details lead figures we would spend hours painting, letting our imaginations run wild!).  Now, so many years later(I guess I am getting old LOL), I am sooooooo loving playing Dungeons & Dragons Online.  While all the stats, abilities, buffs etc. can get rather complicated, thankfully most of that is handled in the background by the game itself. You CAN get super-detailed into your character builds, or you can be abit more casual about it and just have fun.  (if you want a much simpler but still super-fun D&D based game, check out Neverwinter)\n\nWhether playing as a stealthy elven rogue, a magic missle-casting human wizard or a great axe-swinging dwarf fighter(and many other races/classes), you'll enjoy questing thru wilderness areas, dank catacombs, spider web-laden dungeons or hellish sureal settings out of a fiend's nightmares, DDO is a fantasy trip well worth undertaking!","January 14","true","231.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I remember playing this in my uncles basement, rolling die and imagining the beholders and kabolds. Now, I just click click to make a halfling rogue in 2 minutes, then makeing the same character sheet in 30. Times have changed. With free to play abilities D&D is a great game to play. Start from choosing class and race and a rather very in depth face creation hub and your off.  Start with a races human, halfling, elf, dwarf, half -elf, half -orc, warforged with the classes rogue, ranger, artificer, warlock, sorceror, paliden, fighter, barbarian, mage. With a straight foward ''quests lead to a dungeon'' and beat the dungeons with plenty of trainers and merchants around the game. It isn't very difficult to get the hang of. Like its tabletop version, you are pretty much an adventurer off to clear dungeons looking for epic loot. The quests and coupled dungeons do sometimes have a rather good sence of humor to it witch makes for a good read and laugh. The aspect of booby traps and puzzles within the game, in witch you need to use ''example'' my rogues search or disable trap abilities, was rather fun and challanging. The free to play aspect though does get limited as in higher levels you need to unlock along with dungeon/quests of that level. That makes for a lot of stuck between levels grinding for free to play players. Then just getting stuck. Is it a good run until then? YES  but, then the DLC is kinda needed. The graphics are decent with an oldschool feel to it where you can even  change the color of your dice and hubs for custimization. The music is spot on also to what you would expect of the fantasy world and areas. For the nostalgic and those that dont mind throwing some money at to progress.","January 1","true","15.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For some reason they have it set up where you don't get a key or a sub automatically, you have to request one through their support site. And good luck finding the button or method to do so. :( Awesome game, horrible Steam integration.","November 8, 2014","false","31.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

So basically you fight and get nothing until you come upon a magical chest convieniently placed at the end of a dungeon. On top of that there is no open world just "combat zones". You work through a combat zone to discover dungeons but guess what dungeons and combat zones work the same.\nIm sorry but compared to DND at its absoulte prime aspect this games blows ♥♥♥♥. Action rpg sure but honestly its more like click on things and hope to god you swing your sword at them. Really you mean to tell me a DND game is completely based on treasure chests and crates and vases? So i kill lets say 15 humanoids and not a single one can you take their armous or weapons let alone misc gear such as food or potions. Bessssssttttt part of all is looting for example if you try to loot a single item off the ground you are required to click on it. Try clicking on a item that is sitting under two bodieds and a broken crate its ♥♥♥♥ing impossible.\nOh i feel like i forgot something.... oh yeah the DDO store. Ive played many mmos in my time but i have to say none of them is as much pay to play as DDO. You want good gear well good luck. You will run a dungeon 3000 times before you get the gear anywhere near the gear you have to pay actualy money to get. A video game that has any feature where actual currency in real life can be exchanged for anything in game is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Why spend hours playing is joe shmo can pay 200 bucks and be hundreds times better than you? gaaaayyyyy. i cant believe i spent the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time downloading this game","March 14, 2014","false","15.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Unless you're able to get into the game with people who are also starting fresh (or willing to make new characters and allow you to play a role you find interesting) you will not enjoy this game at all. There is virtually nothing you can do solo in this game; you NEED to be in a party of several people to accomplish almost anything beyond level 3.\n\nOverall the game feels incredibly slow paced and is clearly outdated. Even setting aside the graphics, there are numerous bugs that feel like they just shouldn't exist in a game that has been around this long. Expect to have to restart the client at least once every couple of hours due to one issue or another. Nothing about this game flows together nicely.\n\nThe amount of free content is minimal, at best; you will end up having to grind quests just to continue leveling up, and the interface is littered with frequent reminders of the things you could pay for. Unless you have a VIP subscription ($10/month) you will have only about five quests you can do per level, which will not offer you enough experience to advance, forcing you to redo them for even less XP than you earned the first time. The only workaround is being carried  through the game by someone 2-3 levels above you who can unlock quests on a higher difficulty, but then you'll be doing little more than watching them solo the dungeon. It's not fun, and you'll never catch up to a point where you can actually start having fun with them.","June 11, 2015","false","72.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Won't Reccommend.\nwhy? because this is a steam review.\n\nAlso, because of this, having a Steam based forum is pointless, especially seeing as how there's a recorded level of less than 200 players averaging most servers originating on steam.\n(This title should be removed from Steam completely)\n\nI'd probably say go with anything else outside of the DnD franchise.\nnot many players. pretty dead. mostly solo focused. get repetitive and boring fast.\nalso, extremely pay to win and overpriced for everything.\nthe game is old.\nvery. old.\nand glitchy, b/c its never been properly updated.\nin short, just a warning, you'll be wasting over 10 gigs of precious hard drive space for something you'll probably never play.\n\nThis is the only time I'll say, for what it'll take to get the same gaming experience, Just go for World of Warcraft. its cheaper.\nseriously. its way cheaper than this Freemium scam of a game. you can't even do most of the quests without buying your way into it.\nthe controls are very clumsy. and the graphics, even on highest settings feel wasted by the choppy gameplay and clumsy controls.\nagain, If i were to use World of Warcraft as an example, and trust me... I hate WoW and quit it after level 80 in wotlk, i'd have to give more credit to WoW as an MMO.\n\nthere's other MMO's on steam with a larger player base.\n\nanother annoyance: you have to log into a server first before you can see what characters you have saved onto it. if you forget.... you'll have a fun time of starting/closing your game.\n\nactually, another game I'll actually reccomend over this is Warframe. sure, its not medevial or magical, but you'll have a better overall gaming experience with it.\n\n\n\n\nEdit:\nThis game has some of the worst... and I mean WORST customer service I've ever seen in the history of all the games I've ever played and had to troubleshoot something out of.\n\nHave you ever had to deal with that one customer service rep who actually asks stupid things like "is your computer turned on? is it plugged in?" to that level of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ INEPT... wow. just wow. 3 weeks later, still e-mailing back and forth with them, including one supervisor, and two other department heads. averaging about one response a week, following up reporting two csr's not even reading their tickets.\n\nRun by WarnerBrotherGames, they also have no interest in ever linking thier purchases to Steam Wallet. they cheat steam by intentionally disabling the page for buying with steam from their in game store.\n\nhave a glitch? good luck. forums are moderated by trolls who will do thier best with lines like\noh, you have to phone steam to fix your problem!\n(steam support has no phone number)\n\nuninstall. and please, steam, REMOVE THIS ♥♥♥♥ FROM YOUR GAMES. PLEASE.\nand I'm a player who owns and plays uriel's chasm.\nI still call this game utter. ♥♥♥♥ing. ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAlso, I'd like to point out, the forums, including mods of their forums, will stalk you afterwards for even asking for assistance with issues.\n\nFirst time I've ever had to report a mod.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/titoshivan\n\n\nissue still unresolved as mods rather do bans than solve technical issues and only help trolls.","March 1, 2014","false","47.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I run around with some very experienced gamers like myself; which allowed us to max out very quickly in this game (TOO EASY TO MAX OUT). Pretty dull in coloring, transparency, chunky controls and stop, move, stop, move action so lacks smooth transition.  Expansions add some flare, but just turn into the same feeling of no replay value the more and more you level. Even end game lacks compared to all other games I have played that are similar and it's mainly due to it being so easy in comparison. All expansions make it last a bit longer, but very quickly get to the same result. I grew up playing the table top and think it would be better than this example.  I played this game outside of Steam so time played is a bit higher than reported thru steam.\n\nDid I have fun playing even though it required little to no effort = sometimes +1\nDid I feel there was nice character development = sure +1\nDid I like the character development = it was ok, but wanted more -1\nDid I feel boss rewards were worth the effort = Yes and maybe too generous at times given the lack of effort to earn it -1\nDid the mechanics feel satisfactory = some classes felt ok, but others felt very clunky -1\nDid I like the character skill structure = yes, it individualized each class to stand out from the rest, some similar skills among classes but not enough to be too similar feeling. +1\nDid I enjoy solo play = Only way to add some difficulty, but only lower levels, once mid-level everything was 1-2 hits. -1\nDid I enjoy multiplayer = Yes +1\nDid I enjoy the particle effects and actions = mostly +1\n\nAfter that it's actually 5/10 which hits the crossroads of either recommend or not recommend, but if given a person newer to MMOs instead of someone like myself that has a lifetime of examples I would have to give DDO another +1 because it's a great starter MMO for your first, but not after graduating from hundreds into thousands of MMOs tried with max levels in all of them.\n\nSirspoony final rating 6/10 - so play the free game or wait for a sale!\n","July 16, 2015","true","181.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

ONLY FOR NEWBS TO D&D\n\nFirst thing to look at is a comparison to Classic AD&D and this-\n\nThis game is LOOSELY based on the 3.5 Edition from 2003 and while they try to be faithful they fall short of the actual rule set especially now that the Fifth Edition is out. It is okay for people using basic D&D or Starter Sets without complete rules but anyone who has even some knowledge of the Advanced game will not be impressed by this especially since it is missing some key elements and classes that made the game so much more versitile.\n\nNext are the Graphics... and oh good Lord all mighty these graphics didn't age well. Granted this game came out in 2006 but look at WoW: Came out in 2004 and they lasted long enough for a whole decade before being completely revised in the Warlords of Draenor expansion. These graphics (even on the HIGHEST settings) still look terrible. Now I don't personally have to much of a problem as I love classic Games and graphics way over the attempt of Uber Realism now but anyone who is a CoD, WoW, etc will be less than impressed.\n\nVoice acting: Better than Two Worlds, not as good as Two Worlds II... or in terms everyone will understand: Better than Anakin Skywalker/Hayden Christensen, worse than Arnold Swarzenegger playing the Terminator (so worse than Monotone). It is not that good and leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nGameplay- Same as WoW practically. If you have played WoW you will feel at home pretty much. There are Character Creation differences but those are practically the same as Elder Scrolls Dagger Fall and Morrowind. The game plays like WoW almost to a tee in game.\n\nOverall I would rate this game 6/10 for Newbs to D&D only.\n\nIf you are familiar to D&D then this would be 3/10\n\nI don't suggest it. I suggest getting the actual board game. If you never want to play the board game then this is fine, otherwise don't get this.","March 5, 2015","false","1.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I thought WoW was bad, but holy ♥♥♥♥! First off, Subscription, it's optional, without it you get a fairly decent game, filled with things you can't do because you won't give them money. So why buy a subscription? You get to waste your savings getting fictional currency, an exp boost and one or two classes which are free after some months of subscription, 99 dollars per year.\nTurbine Points! The exciting piece, to get 23k Turbine points, it costs 200 dollars!(199.99) About 128 pounds according to Google. Rediculous, as The Druid class costs 1.3k turbine points, and to play as a half orc costs about the same, About 7 other classes and 3 other races also cost the same. You can only make 4 characters, or pay 600 points for another slot, this can be done 30 times.\nThe store is rediculous, blizzard are expensive in selling mounts for real money, but they don't come any where near the quantity of stuff these guys are smoking *Cough* Selling. 200-500 points For companions, which do nothing except follow you, Just like in WoW, but these cost money. You can only change their name once, or have to pay money to do so again.\nFinally, it's very pay to win(Or Lose at life), you can buy experience and stat points to improve your character, becoming immensely overpowered, the more money you put into it. You can also buy the in game currency, in a much more direct way than you can on WoW nowadays.\nThis game is terrible, I don't recommend it, the graphics aren't anything special, especially considering it's only 9 years old and WoW is 10. I'd suggest playing Runescape instead, the graphics are prettier, it has nicer music and it's a lot cheaper for it's micro transactions.","July 13, 2015","false","7.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","9"

I loved DDO.  I've spent countless hours playing DDO over the past several years.  The addition of epic levels and destiies (level 20+) absolutely ruined the game, turning it into a complete grindfest of completing the same content over and over again as fast as you can run from the entrance of a dungeon to its exit.  The game is entirely about XP/min now, where anything worth having is easily available to anyone with the time to grind for it, lots and lots of time.\n\nThe worst aspect of the game is the difficulty levels.  In heroic levels (1-19), there really isn't anything that can't be face rolled on the most difficult setting by a grouip of first timers.  In Epic levels, normal and hard should be renamed cinematic mode, and elite should be renamed forget about it, unless you utilize extremely exploitative builds that remove all challenge from the game (most of which require nearly endless amounts of grinding to achieve).\n\nIf you live in your mom's basement and haven't seen the sun in months, DDO might be the game for you.  If you don't have any skill but all the time in the world to grind out stats, DDO just might be the game for you.  If you suffer from clinical depression yet do not wish to seek treatment but would instead prefer to spend all day every day in a virtual world where endless grinding will make you seem like a super hero, DDO is definitely the game for you.\n\nIf you want a balanced MMORPG that you can play a few hours here and there, yet still be able to take on any challenge the game has to offer through logical build choices that match your playstyle coupled with stategic use of your abilities, well, quite frankly, you need to keep looking.","July 27, 2015","false","4.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","2"

I've played waaaay more as I've regularly played DDO since Aug'2009 just not the Steam download (predate available via Steam).\n\nDDO's a blast. Wizard's a perennial favorite but I think I've run nearly every class to at least 10. VIP, for 3 years now and counting. Highly recommended\n\nUPDATE 2014-06-16: Highly recommneded\n\nPros:\n* D&D -- lots of the traditional lore big and small. Spells, classes, general concepts, monsters and more. Cast Lightning Bolt and Cure Serious Wounds, use a Greataxe or Shortsword, wear Plate Mail and magic rings, fight Kobolds and Beholders and hunt down Ioun Stones and other classics. Nifty new toys too, but DDO draws on the rich tapestry of D&D's 40 years to provide a depth against which most games feel shallow and weak.\n* 3.5ish Edition plus House Rules -- DDO uses a variant of 3.5 Edition. I first played Basic edition (yay Elf as a *class* :P) and enjoyed AD&D, up through 3.5 and not a fan of 4th edition so yay. Turbine's done a pretty good job taking D&D 3.5 and adapting it to an MMO. Some rules changed for the transition from pen-and-paper to MMO (spell points instead of Vancian N-casts-per-day, AC/PRR/DR/Dodge instead of just AC, etc), but overall they work pretty well. There's some kinks and the rules are tinkered with every so often to improve balance or new options but all in all a plus IMO.\n* Rich(est) Character Creation -- there's many options for your character creation and progression. Go pure classed and you still have regular progression and choices of feats, skills and enhancements to evolve your character as you desire. Supports a wide variety of styles and gameplay with lots of replay value. Lots of tinkering, and the forums are full of advice on the various abilities and what works well (or doesn't) for different types of characters and playstyles.\n* Meelee vs Ranged vs Caster -- plenty of variety in gameplay to suit your preferred playstyle.\n* Active Combat -- unlike most MMOs where you click on a target and make a latte while the computer attacks for you,  DDO plays best if you put in some effort. Move out of the way of attacks, aim your spells and arrows, and generally be engaged in the gameplay. Auto-target is supported so you don't need FPS skills, but it's also not autopilot e.g. even if you've painted a target if you turn away your spell etc won't hit (or even be launched) because you do have to reasonably face the target. Some games you can play asleep (literally) but DDO keeps you involved.\n* No PVP -- it's a purely PvE game. This avoids a slew of social problems in many games.\n* Personal loot -- chests reward loot to each individual so no loot stealing, while also allowing you to assign an item to another player if you prefer they have an item instead. No stress mechanic.\n* Community -- it's pretty common to run into folks that are friendly and helpful. It varies a bit depending on the time of day, season, server and luck, but I've found the general attitude is more welcoming than many MMOs.\n\nCons:\n* Rich(est) Character Creation -- if you find WoW has the right level of character complexity (or perhaps too much), then you'll likely find DDO complicated. It's not EVE complex, but it's definitely not at the simpler end of the industry. The complexity has its merits, but it's not everyone's cup of tea. That may be you.\n* No PVP -- if PVP's your thing, you'll hate DDO.\n* No 'End Game' -- DDO doesn't really have an 'end game' like many MMOs. It's something the dev team has acknowledged and appears to be working on, though it likely will take some time to bake out. Right now when you tire of being level 20+, you can "True Reincarnate" and start a new life with some boosted perks. As there's more quests for most of the game than you can run in a single life, this seems to work well all in all. I don't reincarnate very often and have little interest in an 'end game' so you'll need to look to others or folks on the forums (http://forums.ddo.com) for more information. That said, it can take a while to hit cap (a month for experienced folks, many months or more for less experienced folks who don't play a lot) so this may may not be much interest to you.\n* Forums emphasize Min/Max-ing -- the forums (unsurprisingly) have a larger % of advanced players than the mix of actual players in the game. This is good as it provides a lot of tips on gameplay, but can also be somewhat elitist and focus on min-/max-ing characters for the most difficult of gameplay. I've played for 5+ years on multiple servers, >30 characters and yet only hit level 20 a few times, only TR'd for a 2nd life 3-4 times, never TR'd to a 3rd life yet, my highest level every was 22 and I strongly prefer Heroic (1-20) levels over Epic (21-28). But if you read the forums you'd think everyone maxes out characters (level 28 today), TRs multiple times to race back to level cap, and only runs Epic Elite difficulty (hardest of the hardest). Understand forum posters are disproportionately more old hand and very advanced and take some of the comments with a grain of salt.\n\nMixed:\n* Epic (level 20+) -- DDO invented new 'destinies' for 'epic' levels. You stop gaining in classes at level 20 and gain experience and abilities in your 'desinty/ies'. Personally I find this part of the game less interesting, but some prefer it. Heroic (level 1-20) and Epic levels definitely have a differently feel to their gameplay, character progression and enemies, so YMMV.\n* Graphics -- DDO doesn't have the shiniest newest eye candy. It's not bad at all (and has aged well), and newer areas are prettier (FR in general makes most of Eberron look a tad dull by comparison, though that may be more the choice of color palette than the graphics per se), but if you need the glitziest eye candy and don't care about gameplay then DDO may not be for you.\n* Eberron -- DDO initially used the Eberron setting, which has a touch of steampunk-ish feel to some. They've recently expanded to Faerun (in a lore consistent way) though Forgotten Realms are mainly new content for levels 15+. If you hate Eberron or simply require FR, you may find DDO underwhelming. [That said, if you choose an 'Iconic' character you start at level 15. But I don't recommend it if you're new to DDO, as the rich mechanics and options will likely leave you puzzled if you didn't learn them along the way.]\n\nPersonally I find the character customization, combat mechanics and general lore to be the most compelling facets, and never been much of a PvP'er so the PvE gameplay fits my tastes quite well.\n\nI've owned every Bioware Infinity engine game, loved Wizardry and Wasteland and more back in the day, have played most MMOs (and found most wanting, or just boring all too quickly) including WoW, Rift, Tera, Path of Exile, Champions Online, Neverwinter, ESO, DC:OU, Marvel Heroes, SW:TOR, The Secret World, and too many more to name. I've poked at plenty new games over the years, but even the best fall by the wayside. I've taken a break from DDO every now and again, but it's the only game over  the years years I routinely find myself drawn back into.\n\nBeing F2P it's easy enough to try out and form your own opinion. You can easily level to ~10 as F2P (there's actually too many quests available - you can easily hit 10 w/o running anywhere near every quest available), and you can go higher though it may take some effort as F2P quests thin out a bit in the teens. [It's still possible to hit 20+ as F2P, see forums and YouTube for more details, but if you enjoy DDO you'll probably want to spend a few by that point, for multiple reasons.] VIP is a pretty good deal if that's what you want, or you can buy quest packs as you please if you prefer. There's plenty of threads on http://forums.ddo.com about the limits and tradeoffs of F2P vs P2P vs VIP if you're trying to decide what appeals to you.","October 19, 2012","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It hasn't aged that gracefully (though it doesn't look bad by any means), and they have made many concessions to appease solo players. That being said, playing this with a group of friends, adventuring together with 4-5 people, each filling a different classic D&D role, is a blast, occasionally verging on sublime. The bite size nature of each adventure makes it work for all sorts of schedules.","June 27, 2012","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All I know is that this game is a multiplayer action game that gets it right.   The action doesn't start until you are in a private instance with your small group.     It is an ACTION game.   You don't have to select a target to perform an action.  You don't click on an area on the ground to make your character move to that direction.    There are no restrictions whatsoever.    You *can* select a target and then cast a fireball and your fireball will go towards that target.  Or you can aim your fireball whereever the hell you please and fire it a few feet in front of where the monster is running to.     The magic system in this game makes other games look like peanuts.   Select where to cast things... position a firewall vertically in a doorway to have it hit the crowd of monsters trying to push through multiple times.    Not only is everything in the environment fair game and 'within the game world' (jump up on those barrels in the stock room to get out of those spider's reach.. or blow up the same barrels with the enemies on top of it to send them hurtling to the floor.   Its the underlying system of the game consisting of skills, saving throws, rolls all put into an action game with hit boxes that literally leaves other games of the genre in the dust.   Other games just have you running through a plastic environment... here you jump through traps... maybe you were fast enough to avoid the blade entirely.. maybe you didn't in which case you have to make a reflex saving throw to avoid damage.      I highly recommend that everyone not only try out this game but also level a character to the higher levels to get a good idea of what the game is about.    Sadly they've dumbed it down a little especially the tutorial area which used  to have a very gritty steal some of these items from a grimey harbor area warehouse to now it takes place on a disneyesque island more directed at a younger crowd (I imagine to not scare as many people away)","February 13, 2015","true","135.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has come a long way from "kobold island". With advanced multiclassing, talent trees that matter, feats, skill points, complex crafting system, there exists countless viable possibilities. Be the person disarming traps, picking locks, and spotting ambushers in the raid. Be the person turning the massive piles of spare loot into epic raid-level items for the guild. Be a golem artificer healing yourself while doing massive damage with magic items. Be a dwarven skald wielding waraxe and lute. Be a half-orc paladin smashing skulls for the greater good. For options, you would be extremely hard pressed to find more. And for viable fun ones? Look no further. For while you can make a character that is useless, novices are suggested to use a standard prebuilt, you won't find a game with more useful builds this side of Ebberon.\nPros: Extreme character flexibility, viability for group play with non-combat characters, raid-level gear can be found in any max level dungeon (rarely) and crafted with (many) components from standard drops, unique setting, Magi-Tech (very few games have it, and fewer have it so extensivly. Only other one I know of in MMO form is Allods Online), advanced role-playing options, fair methods of earning premium currency through gameplay, dedicated community, really there are a lot of good things going for it.\nCons: Dodge require no-combat points to use, called tumble. Can be extremely useful, but locked behind skill-point wall. Swim is not very useful because of the starter island granting rings of 2 minutes of waterbreathing, a must have for all adventures. Diplomacy is vital for high end dps to lose threat, and intimidate for getting the threat to effectivly tank, dated graphics (but still good, if low resolution), extreme combat diffrence of top builds versus lowest (for this reason starters are reccomended to use default prebuilts), no alchemy causing potions to be scarce for low level characters (and very expensive to buy at stores), auction house has limited slots to sell items per server, most powerful race class combos (warforged and artificer for example) locked behind paywall (but any race with the right free class can come extremely close), multiclassed characters can become extremely powerful if built right.\nOverview: while its sheer number of options causes some problems, these can be avoided using the solidly built pre-built characters. The sheer options do a lot more harm that good. Very good game, 9/10.","April 18, 2014","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the flow of this game more then the old Baldur's Gate games and Neverwinter Nights games as well. A lot of the neater adventures have to be purchased- which is a drag but they're fun so if you like the game it isn't a big deal. Purchaseable gear, upgrades, ect aren't game breaking but are an advantage early on.

While it is P2W, there are certainly aspects on in that counter that. The following lists are not complete, I already feel the game calling me back.\n\nPros:\n- customizability coming out of my ears. You can play the same class and race and still end up with totally different character builds from it.\n\n- Leveling system. This is kind of part of the customizability, but on a different aspect. The leveling is much different from normal MMOs, since you get experience from quests and not actually killing monsters. While this makes grinding a bit harder, it also makes leveling more rewarding. There are also two different types of levels, ranks and actual levels. This makes it interesting to rank up due to the different bonuses.\n\n- Addicting. I don't know what it is that draws me to this game, but I just can't stop playing it. It's absolutely amazing and ccompletely fun to play!\n\nCons:\n- P2W aspects. Naturally, there must be money coming to the developers from somewhere since it's F2P. A lot of quests, classes, and races are locked to those who are willing to pay. However, I have learned that simply the experience boost from the monthly VIP is well worth the money.\n\n- Starting area. If you like to experiment with classes, you will learn to hate the first island. You can choose to skip it after your first playthrough, but then you miss a lot of leveling. And that sucks. A lot.","May 4, 2015","true","103.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I started on September 2010 (before downloading it on Steam) in the Orien server and after purchasing a character switch to the Cannith server, I am still currently active with this game. I remember the all-nighters I'd put into the game to grind for favor to purchase Pay-To-Play content. I've met interesting people over the years and I continue to meet new people in Cannith. DDO has been around for more than ten years and I give high respect to the developers for the continuing support to this game.\n\nThere are no perfect games out there of course. I want to share two of my biggest pet peeves in this game:\n- The introduction of the champion system is painful and I fear for the new players that will experiment their first "Elite" difficulty dungeons only to get massacred by a champion. Champions are monsters with a flaming crown on their head and after being slain, they drop mysterious remnants which can be turned in for items. The mysterious remnants do not reward the effort of defeating a champion because from time to time, Turbine adds in the good rewards from time to time and you're not guaranteed the items you want. Usually the rewards are mediocre and other easier methods can be used to purchase the equivalent item. I would prefer for the champion system to have been optional to all players.\n- DDO has a fair share of lag where occasionally, if you're in a dungeon, you will not be able to interact with your character even after pressing all buttons (like jump, casting a heal, etc) will not initiate action. You will be stuck and if you're surrounded by monsters, your character is good as dead due to the inability to heal and fight back.\n\nIn summary, I still enjoy DDO although it's outdated. Due to the amount of time I've invested in the game, that investment still keeps me going because I know I can look back upon the experiences and memories I had in this game. Also, I find it easier to stick to things I already know.","July 31, 2015","true","855.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/recommended/206480/","JaysonFour","JaysonFour","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/","299 products in account","Before there were games like Pathfinder, there was but one big tabletop fantasy game that saw fit to rule them all- Dungeons and Dragons. Anybody who's ever looked at a d20 while cross-eyed has either at least heard of the game, knows someone who plays, or has rolled up a character and found themselves sitting at a table with a two-liter and a bag of cheese doodles. I'm one of the latter ones- I used to have a game night in college- not much any more though. But as far as properties upon Steam, well, there are two of them I pay attention to, and they're both ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes- and both are free-to-play. Both of them have their ups and downs. In this one, I'm paying attention to the aptly-named Dungeons and Dragons Online.\n\nThere are a number of different kinds of MMO out there- there's the kinds that style themselves after WoW, with the open-world, the questing, the grouping up, the tradeskilling... D&DO isn't like that- instead, I liken it to a one-player game of D&D, where the game itself is your own, personal DM to run you through adventures of various length. Adventures are broken up into three lengths- short, medium, or long crawls. Each adventure has specific goals and offers chests full of loot for when you finish them, and the loot tables do not hold back. You won't just find a suit of plate armor, you'll find yourself a suit of plate that has five or six words describing its effectiveness and special abilities, and there are a lot of them out there.\n\nCombat and mechanics are run using either the 3rd or 4th edition of D&D- you'll actually get to see the d20's result on the screen- and yes you can still get nat 20's and absolutely wreck stuff.\n\nThere aren't really that many downsides, but they ARE there- for example, if you're limited to solo play, some classes are going to get absolutely wrecked without careful planning and a few barrels of healing potion- most of your casting classes except for healing, for example. I'd recommend a fighter or priest for your first time through, just so you don't get frustrated. Most of your treasure will be sold and converted to healing potions over the course of the game, so don't get too attached to any specific item; you'll be drinking potions like cans of Pepsi.\n\nThere is an in-game premium store, but it doesn't take Steam funbucks to buy things- instead, you need to buy something called "Turbine Points" with a credit card or gift card and use those to buy adventure packs and other things. The really crappy thing is that if you don't buy them, you'll end up hitting a level limit, and be unable to progress. They've also hidden a number of options in Character Creation away behind paywalls- races, classes, Epic Destinies (stories tailored around a specific character archetype)- if you want to run something like a half-elf, or a druid, be prepared to fork over. I can understand that yeah, they have to make a profit, but still- really, guys? I'd make an exception if you could buy Turbine Points with Steambucks, but this just kind of irks me.\n\nI think the first level limit is like 20 or 25 but I'm only at level 4 right now, though.\n\nSome adventures are tailored for some classes and playstyles over others. There's an adventure in the second hub of the game that requires you to sneak around to steal a ruby from a bunch of kobolds. You are limited in the number of one type of enemy you can kill, and as it turns out, fighters in plate mail aren't all that good at not making noise, and you'll find yourself swarmed in no time unless you're using the right class.\n\nOf special note is the fact that they managed to get Wil Wheaton to come in and DM an entire adventure pack. I haven't played through it, but to be honest, I kind of want to check it out.\n\nAll in all, I have to say that if you're looking for an old-fashioned game of D&D that gives you that feel of being at a table with somebody sitting behind a screen with a stack of adventures, ready to play as much or as little as you want at a time- this is the one you'll want to go for. If you're looking for something more in the vein of World of Warcraft, you'll want to check out my next review.\n\nTL;DR: An MMO that feels like sitting at a tabletop playing your own personal game of D&D. I like that. 7/10.","February 18","true","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unqlfife/recommended/206480/","unqlfife","rad1c","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unqlfife/","270 products in account","I have mixed feelings about D&D Online, really. I love this game, but I hate it at the same time.\n\nShort version:\nVery buggy, very laggy, feels lonely and abandoned, a game which had and still has (some investment required...) great potential but turned into a micro-transaction hell (borderline P2W). So 'as is' I cannot recommend it I'm afraid.\n\nLong version:\nPROs - I love the classes, stats, feats, weapons, the world(!), everything that makes the game really, really D&D as if it was pen and paper, including the crazy-amount of work people put into working out and programming quests and recording story telling (actual DMs' narrations!) for instances.\nIt feels like I sit at the desk with my DM, and getting all the details for a colorful, great experience. Sugar and spice!\nThe fights can go epic, the instances are at least nice but many of them are just great, clever story lines, fun characters.\n\nCONs - Controls are a little uncomfortable (but it's OK-ish, one can live with it).\nThe game's code is so messy it eats resources like a monster, sooner or later hangs up and literally no hardware or net can compensate lags to make them go away.\nBugs and sloppiness ruin gaming experience as well as the small things, like fights in instances regularly start at the same time as DM narration does, so story telling experience is ruined or is taken away from the player as one has to focus on combat. Also, item-icons are not tiny masterpieces (WoW), but minimalist graphics (e.g. "old free mmos") put together in hurry (in mspaint?) so don't look very nice.\n\nThe charm of story lines and worked out instances go away on higher levels. It feels like hard work and a lot of details were added to the game when development was started, and it just got more and more sloppy as time passed and -probably- release date/deadline came closer.\n\nSadly, this rush was not compensated later, after the game started to produce income. No release addressing riching existing content and fixing bugs, refactoring, etc... Feels like owner/devs/whoever abandoned the game, adding only new content for some $$$ sometimes, and this is it.\n\nAnother huge negative: the crafting system. It's laggy (in the extreme, "disenchanting" an item takes up to 20-30 seconds), as well as low in complexity but over-complicated.\nNo useful items can be crafted (this might change with highest profession level, but all I created were very expensive junk in my gaming hours and seemed virtually impossible to reach high item crafting skill level without shoveling huge amount of real money in it...).\n\nNext, the 'crystal' system: (crystals for $$$, spend crystals in-game).\nI'm not saying the game is P2W, but who would leave a good progress behind in the very last moment of an instance, just because of a single wipe? The bad news is wipe costs money and many times it really hurts not to resurrect and keep going.\nAfter a certain point it is also a must to spend $$$ on the game, otherwise several things will be inaccessible. It is not impossible to live without those, "but"...\n\nLast but not least, community. There aren't many players, so the game feels orphaned. This affects economics, chat q&a, server "life", everything... Guilds are either max-level and full or abandoned... I had this feeling everywhere I looked.\nSo (at least for me) after a while it felt like I'm playing an "online single player" game.\n\nAltogether, there's so much potential in this game, and so little delivered!\nI feel sorry for the amount of work & love & sweat & blood sacrificed for this game, and let it all be gone by not maintaining&developing the core - at least on a level where servers could be merged, so all the players could get in touch with each other.\n\nSo, just to sum it up: the whole game feels abandoned from every aspect and on every level, but a huge investment could turn it into a great game - and if it happens, I will be the first player to go back and start playing D&D Online again!","June 8, 2015","false","145.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/recommended/206480/","JaysonFour","JaysonFour","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/","299 products in account","Before there were games like Pathfinder, there was but one big tabletop fantasy game that saw fit to rule them all- Dungeons and Dragons. Anybody who's ever looked at a d20 while cross-eyed has either at least heard of the game, knows someone who plays, or has rolled up a character and found themselves sitting at a table with a two-liter and a bag of cheese doodles. I'm one of the latter ones- I used to have a game night in college- not much any more though. But as far as properties upon Steam, well, there are two of them I pay attention to, and they're both ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes- and both are free-to-play. Both of them have their ups and downs. In this one, I'm paying attention to the aptly-named Dungeons and Dragons Online.\n\nThere are a number of different kinds of MMO out there- there's the kinds that style themselves after WoW, with the open-world, the questing, the grouping up, the tradeskilling... D&DO isn't like that- instead, I liken it to a one-player game of D&D, where the game itself is your own, personal DM to run you through adventures of various length. Adventures are broken up into three lengths- short, medium, or long crawls. Each adventure has specific goals and offers chests full of loot for when you finish them, and the loot tables do not hold back. You won't just find a suit of plate armor, you'll find yourself a suit of plate that has five or six words describing its effectiveness and special abilities, and there are a lot of them out there.\n\nCombat and mechanics are run using either the 3rd or 4th edition of D&D- you'll actually get to see the d20's result on the screen- and yes you can still get nat 20's and absolutely wreck stuff.\n\nThere aren't really that many downsides, but they ARE there- for example, if you're limited to solo play, some classes are going to get absolutely wrecked without careful planning and a few barrels of healing potion- most of your casting classes except for healing, for example. I'd recommend a fighter or priest for your first time through, just so you don't get frustrated. Most of your treasure will be sold and converted to healing potions over the course of the game, so don't get too attached to any specific item; you'll be drinking potions like cans of Pepsi.\n\nThere is an in-game premium store, but it doesn't take Steam funbucks to buy things- instead, you need to buy something called "Turbine Points" with a credit card or gift card and use those to buy adventure packs and other things. The really crappy thing is that if you don't buy them, you'll end up hitting a level limit, and be unable to progress. They've also hidden a number of options in Character Creation away behind paywalls- races, classes, Epic Destinies (stories tailored around a specific character archetype)- if you want to run something like a half-elf, or a druid, be prepared to fork over. I can understand that yeah, they have to make a profit, but still- really, guys? I'd make an exception if you could buy Turbine Points with Steambucks, but this just kind of irks me.\n\nI think the first level limit is like 20 or 25 but I'm only at level 4 right now, though.\n\nSome adventures are tailored for some classes and playstyles over others. There's an adventure in the second hub of the game that requires you to sneak around to steal a ruby from a bunch of kobolds. You are limited in the number of one type of enemy you can kill, and as it turns out, fighters in plate mail aren't all that good at not making noise, and you'll find yourself swarmed in no time unless you're using the right class.\n\nOf special note is the fact that they managed to get Wil Wheaton to come in and DM an entire adventure pack. I haven't played through it, but to be honest, I kind of want to check it out.\n\nAll in all, I have to say that if you're looking for an old-fashioned game of D&D that gives you that feel of being at a table with somebody sitting behind a screen with a stack of adventures, ready to play as much or as little as you want at a time- this is the one you'll want to go for. If you're looking for something more in the vein of World of Warcraft, you'll want to check out my next review.\n\nTL;DR: An MMO that feels like sitting at a tabletop playing your own personal game of D&D. I like that. 7/10.","February 18","true","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love this game, but I hate it at the same time.\n\nShort version:\nVery buggy, very laggy, feels lonely and abandoned, a game which had and still has (some investment required...) great potential but turned into a micro-transaction hell (borderline P2W). So 'as is' I cannot recommend it I'm afraid.\n\nLong version:\nPROs - I love the classes, stats, feats, weapons, the world(!), everything that makes the game really, really D&D as if it was pen and paper, including the crazy-amount of work people put into working out and programming quests and recording story telling (actual DMs' narrations!) for instances.\nIt feels like I sit at the desk with my DM, and getting all the details for a colorful, great experience. Sugar and spice!\nThe fights can go epic, the instances are at least nice but many of them are just great, clever story lines, fun characters.\n\nCONs - Controls are a little uncomfortable (but it's OK-ish, one can live with it).\nThe game's code is so messy it eats resources like a monster, sooner or later hangs up and literally no hardware or net can compensate lags to make them go away.\nBugs and sloppiness ruin gaming experience as well as the small things, like fights in instances regularly start at the same time as DM narration does, so story telling experience is ruined or is taken away from the player as one has to focus on combat. Also, item-icons are not tiny masterpieces (WoW), but minimalist graphics (e.g. "old free mmos") put together in hurry (in mspaint?) so don't look very nice.\n\nThe charm of story lines and worked out instances go away on higher levels. It feels like hard work and a lot of details were added to the game when development was started, and it just got more and more sloppy as time passed and -probably- release date/deadline came closer.\n\nSadly, this rush was not compensated later, after the game started to produce income. No release addressing riching existing content and fixing bugs, refactoring, etc... Feels like owner/devs/whoever abandoned the game, adding only new content for some $$$ sometimes, and this is it.\n\nAnother huge negative: the crafting system. It's laggy (in the extreme, "disenchanting" an item takes up to 20-30 seconds), as well as low in complexity but over-complicated.\nNo useful items can be crafted (this might change with highest profession level, but all I created were very expensive junk in my gaming hours and seemed virtually impossible to reach high item crafting skill level without shoveling huge amount of real money in it...).\n\nNext, the 'crystal' system: (crystals for $$$, spend crystals in-game).\nI'm not saying the game is P2W, but who would leave a good progress behind in the very last moment of an instance, just because of a single wipe? The bad news is wipe costs money and many times it really hurts not to resurrect and keep going.\nAfter a certain point it is also a must to spend $$$ on the game, otherwise several things will be inaccessible. It is not impossible to live without those, "but"...\n\nLast but not least, community. There aren't many players, so the game feels orphaned. This affects economics, chat q&a, server "life", everything... Guilds are either max-level and full or abandoned... I had this feeling everywhere I looked.\nSo (at least for me) after a while it felt like I'm playing an "online single player" game.\n\nAltogether, there's so much potential in this game, and so little delivered!\nI feel sorry for the amount of work & love & sweat & blood sacrificed for this game, and let it all be gone by not maintaining&developing the core - at least on a level where servers could be merged, so all the players could get in touch with each other.\n\nSo, just to sum it up: the whole game feels abandoned from every aspect and on every level, but a huge investment could turn it into a great game - and if it happens, I will be the first player to go back and start playing D&D Online again!","June 8, 2015","false","145.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a dedicated D&D tabletop player. I've been playing Pathfinder since it's inception. I know how it all works. I love that this takes D&D to a new level. You can actually play without friends because you can find others online to play with you with the LFG feature OR play with friends and have a blast solving puzzles and slicing enemies.\n\nMy recommendation to people new to the game like I was, but familiar with D&D: do NOT follow the pre-built path. Build your own. It will help you so much in the long run as the computer generated paths tend to put your points in the wrong things.\n\nMake your own mistakes rather than letting a computer do it for you. This game is amazing, I would highly recommend paying for some of the features. The subscription is no worse than subscribing for any other MMO.","August 15, 2015","true","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
