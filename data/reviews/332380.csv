A lot of games I don't review, but there are some I do feel the need to, as a personal encouragement or warning to others.\n\nProblem is, this game is both. It's a solid retro RPG with very high production values, from art to music to game mechanics.\nWhich may make the faults more glaring, since everything else is just so darn good.\n\nI do love the game but yet my recommendation of it is cautionary in nature.\n\nFor instance, the main hero comes across as whiny and juvenile because other characters get something that he doesn't, so he has to make their lives totally miserable for it. And it does grow very tiresome and damages the storyline.\n\nThere's a lot of abilities to learn, and they come in three stages, but if you can't find the first stage then you'll never have that ability the rest of the game. The kicker? At an early point in the game you can't return to the areas that have those first lessons so you're completely locked out even though you don't even have your full party yet.\n\nKicker #2 - a lot of those abilities are hidden somewhere on the map and if you don't criss-cross every pixel of the overland map and bump into every wall every step you can miss the hidden area entirely, so no skill for you.\n\nGames that have a "too bad, so sad, sucks to be you" penalty on players is a big turn-off. As well as making games deliberately difficult in order to "encourage" the added purchase of game guides.\n\nKicker #3 - Finding the skill-giver is only half the problem. The skills cost gold to learn, per character. So you'll be offered the skill at say 300 gold per character, while you're fighting mobs that drop 2-8 gold per fight, 13 if you're lucky. This is on Normal difficulty.\n\nSo if you don't have the money and have to leave the hidden area to grind a few hours to build up the bank, hope and pray you can find that pixel again within that huge expanse of open nothingness, or twisty tunnels when you want to return to it.\n\nThis is why the game may take 100 hours to finish. The male hero's constant whining will make that seem much, much longer.\n\nWhen they say exploration game, they're not kidding. This is both and OCD'er dream and nightmare wrapped up in one. There's enough grinding and backtracking to make Aveyond seem like the length of a comic book.","May 7, 2015","true","34.0"," 168 of 178 people (94%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","94","168","178","17","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/recommended/332380/","doc_rock2","Doc Rock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/","485 products in account","Every now and then we come across a game that takes us by surprise and reminds us not to be so quick to judge. Asguaard is one of those games. At first glance, this old-school RPG fantasy game from Aldorlea Games[www.aldorlea.org] looks like a small indie title that you would expect to offer you a few hours of simple gameplay. I assure you that's not the case. I have been pleasantly surprised at how much depth this game offered. Asguaard is a diamond in the rough, a nostalgic throwback RPG made in the same fashion as so many of the Nintendo RPG titles I fondly played in my youth. I thoroughly enjoy playing this 16-bit adventure  and strongly recommend it to any true RPG fan.\n\nThe story behind Asguaard is rich and well-developed even though its typical for these types of games. Our hero is a sometimes relunctant and sarcastic teenage boy who has somehow been summoned to the vast world of Asguaard by a village of Dwarves in order to save their world from peril. As with most RPG's, you will encounter friends along the way who will join you in your epic quest.\n\nThe characters themselves offer a variety of abilities and talents. Players even get to decide which type of weapon they want the characters to specialize in. Plus, you can teach your characters a number of useful skills along the way. Particularly useful in this expansive endeavor is a skill called "Pathfinding." Trust me, this is one skill you definitely want to make use of. Asguaard is littered with over 500 locations and 150 secret places so using this skill will help guide you through the numerous maze-like dungeons and keep you on the chosen path to progress the story. Without it, one can easily get lost because this world is huge. Other skills can be just as useful, especially later in the game. The characters all have unique personalities and while the tons of dialogue can be monotonous at times, there are some funny "LOL" moments included.\n\nLike the 16-bit graphics and anime-styled artwork, the sounds and music of this game help add to that classic RPG feeling. None of these things will leave a big impression on you, but they are good for a game like this. The controls are simple and the game does offer full controller support if that's your preference. There is also the option to play in either full-screen or window mode. There are several difficulty levels to choose from and you also will also get to choose how often the random encounters occur as you explore the dungeon and world maps. These are definitely worth considering before beginning your adventure because Asguaard is quite long. In fact, this game offers between 50-100+ hours of gameplay from start to finish depending on your gaming style and how much grinding or exploration you choose to do.\n\nThe Good:\n=======+  Good graphics and sound for a 16-bit game\n+  Many hours of actual gameplay\n+  Variety of character abilities/customization options\n+  Numerous dungeons & secret places with many special treasures\n+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements\n+  Low CPU usage - runs smoothly on most all systems\n+  Full Controller Support\n\nThe Bad:\n======-  Controller play is not mapped out well. More of a hassle than a convenince\n-  With tons of dialogue, an auto-scroll timer would be a welcome addition\n-  Battles are very lackluster and flat. No special effects or animations to enhance them\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n===========Asguaard is not your typical 16-bit game. In fact, Aldorlea Games offers some of the best RPGMaker titles on the market and Asguaard is a perfect example. The game is well-designed, runs smoothly, and offers many hours of exploration and adventure. While the full-price may seem a bit much for a game of this type, its not unreasonable by no means considering all of the content included. True RPG fans will want to add this game to their libraries, especially if they can grab it during a discount promotion.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 23, 2015","true","41.5"," 54 of 75 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","54","75","2","3"

Ninja","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodninja87/","191 products in account","I feel the need to write this review as a disclaimer since I didn't see any other review touch on it.\n\nThis game gets everything right when it comes to old school RPG's except one thing, the story. While the general story concept is a cool idea, it was delivered terribly. Characters in this game come off as flat and obnoxious, and at some times completely lifeless. The dialogue is poorly written and your objectives don't usually make sense. Also some of the main plot points are just absurd.\n\nHowever if the story element doesn't bother you I would reccomend this game to any fan of old school RPG's, because despite the story flaws, the game is really enjoyable to play. There are a ton of secrets to find, dungeons to explore, and extra bosses to beat.\n\nTL;DR\nStory elements suck but everything else in the game is solid and true to old school RPG's plus some extra perks. 7/10","July 17, 2015","true","26.2"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","0"

That's what defines Asguaard and makes it stand apart.\nNo sidequests. Not this time. You have a mission - a boy summoned in an unknown world has to stop its destruction. And little time for it. Your quest takes you through the whole vast world - from snowy montains to lowlands, to deserts and tropical caves, to deep caverns. And even deeper ...\n\nAt first sight you might think there aren't many RPG elements in Asguaard. Only levelling and nothing more. No character customization, no skill trees ... But that's not the case. There are trainers, scattered all over the world. And they can learn you various spells and skills, such as pathfinding, picking herbs, counterattacking, weapon proficiency and so on. But you need to find them first.. Some of them are in the cities, but many are well hidden - in dungeons or even in secret locations.\nAlso, there are three levels of these spells, i.e. three levels of trainers. You need the lower levels first, to be "eligible" to receive the next-level training. The trainers can give you directions to theirs teacher (i.e. higher level trainers), but the description if often vague, such as "somewhere in the swamp". Since learning different skills changes the gameplay considerably, it gives you a good incentive for searching for the trainers. That is - for exploring.\n\nAnd exploring is what Asguaard is really about. Yes, it has a great (and moving and epic) story. Yes, there are tons of turn-based battles. Well tuned and sometimes (on higher difficulties) pretty tough, requiring a well thought out strategy. But in the end, you will remember the huge, detailed maps and tricky dungeons. And the feeling.\nThe feeling you got, when you searched the last piece of a map and found a secret location. And found a great weapon. A great weapon that allows you to defeat a boss you found eariler in cave (When you searched one of the maps, of course!) and who was to strong for you. Or when you spend an hour finding a way out of a dungeon, fighting battles and listening to the captivating music.\n\nWhen you rush through the game on an easy difficulty and don't bother exploring, you probably can't understand the game. But squeeze all the little secrets out of it, and you get an experience few games can give you.\nSo don't hesitate - this game is worth it! For me, it's still one of my top gaming experiences, even more than five years after my first playthrough.","April 13, 2015","true","16.2"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","32","46","0","2"

Vast world with oodles of nooks and crannies to explore, cute characters with similarly endearing dialogue. As with other works from Aldorlea, the story is perhaps somewhat childish, even naive, but hey, oldschool JRPG fans like myself will still get plenty of kicks out of the smooth, almost beautifully chaotic battle sequences and the nearly endless hunt for treasure and secrets.

The story about dwarfs summoning humans to fight evil...well it sounds interesting. But in the game there is nothing left. Like x-thousands of similar games you form a party, others join..and than you explore and fight.\nThere are some interesting parts: Of course you can learn skills...from NPC...for gold. Hard earned gold because for the first hours you don't get much if you grind....and there are many skills you could learn. So you must choose wisely...and don't forget you must also buy items and equipment. And don't you forget to save. Because even at the start there are some monsters that you can only fight much later...so, if the game ask you if you want to enter a location (or a friend tells you not to go further) think and save.\nAnother point worth mentioning are the many secrect locations. You can find them everywhere. Sadly only a few are\nlogical choices. That means if you want to find them....well you must walk every part of the map.\n\nI am a little unsure about recommendation. There are so many RPG-Maker games. And many have a better story (the graphic is standard).\nSo I would say...buy it, if you are a fan of RPG-Maker games without a big storyline...BU'T only if its on sale!!!","December 31, 2015","true","9.7"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

Asguaard is a land of dwarves and fairies. A wonderful place, but now in danger because the Pandora Box has been opened and seven plagues are about to destroy the land. Only a human can save the world and the dwarves manage to summon even two of them, Glen and Rayanne. Accompanied by the faithful dwarf Grom and a little unicorn they set off to find what's necessary to prevent the worst from happening.\n\nIf I should choose one word to describe Asguaard, it would be HUGE. Huge world maps and huge dungeons with many many secrets to discover. There are countless Hidden Locations (on the world maps) and Magical Rooms (in dungeons or villages ...) to be found and if you explore thoroughly you'll be well rewarded.\nSomeone asked, what's the point of secret rooms. Well, just the fun of searching and the satisfaction of finding them! If that's something you like, then you'll really get your money's worth in this game! But even if you don't - finding the secret rooms is not mandatory at all, and if you decide to leave them be, you'll still get hours and hours and hours of fun playing this game!\nOptically the world of Asguaard is just beautiful. The maps are very detailed. A lot of effort has obviously been put into creating them.\n\nAnother feature that makes this game outstanding is an extremely elaborate system of skills your characters can acquire. There are almost 30 different skills, each to be learned in 3 levels (Expert, Master, Guru). They are being taught by dwarves you find all over the world and you decide what to spend your money on. Most of them prove themselves very valuable throughout the game. Just one example out of many: If you learn "Path Finding", little arrows will lead your way through dungeons, and no matter how big they are, with this help you'll never really get lost.\n\nAlso an awesome asset is the "Friendship" skill that all characters have. You can choose who is your best friend, and according to your choice the characters will collect friendship points with each battle. For certain amounts of points they will achieve friendship statuses that will help in battles. They might heal each other, boost each other .....\nThe choice of who's your best friend can be altered anytime, so you can get the best out of every combination.\n\nThe game has invisible encounters. Fights are turn-based. Glen is a fighter, the other three characters can fight and use spells. There's not such a big variety of different spells as in other Aldorlea games, but the ones available are by far sufficient. How hard the fights are depends on the difficulty level you choose at the beginning of the game - easy, normal or hard. You can also adjust the encounter rate.\n\nTo top the game off there are several additional locations you can visit, that have nothing to do with the main quest and are optional, but you can find nice stuff there. They are to be found on the world maps.\nAlso there are a few caves with monsters. If you defeat them, you'll get nice rewards, like money or valuable items. Sometimes the monsters are fairly easy, sometimes really hard, so you better keep them until later in the game. With those monsters you can test your fighting skills too if you dare to attack them at lower levels.\n\nThere's just one thing in this game that I'd like to change: making traveling easier in the first part (later there is a way to travel that's easy and quick).\nMore teleport points would be very helpful. There are very few teleport crystals, but in order to get skills and other things you need to travel back and forth quite a lot and all the walking can become a bit annoying sometimes. A teleport station in each and every village would have been great.\nAlso, a "Go through" option for caves like in other Aldorlea games would have been very nice too.\n\nOther than that I really enjoy this game a lot. There's so much to do and so much to discover. Definitely a very recoommendable game!","April 13, 2015","true","58.2"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","22","33","0","0"

You will have around 100hp from level 1-10. You will find alot of gold laying on the floor for no reason. battles last as long as 1 turn, sometimes 2 if your unlucky or if you dont have equipment. weapon's can crit for over 10x the damage they normally do. armor can make you invincible. the story is about a kid from our world that hate's that he has been transported to this one[his name is GLEN]. GLEN is overpowered, he has a counter ability that always work's, can heal himself for alot, and by level 10 can revive himself. after he makes his way threw a long cave running into wall after wall until he finds a girl by a campfire. After being teleport to a nearby town outside the cave you travel to another town in the world to learn magic except GLEN cant learn anything, and complains about how the girl that's now following him around has learned alot of magic. I think you understand why the story is bad by now.\n\nThe other things this game has... a huge world with lots of secret places, what the hell is the point of secret places, all i found was gold in them. there was a cave i found as i was searching the area around where i was supposed to be. when i went to that cave something growled at me. after saying no to entering the cave i saved the game went right back to the cave and killed the giant wolf in 2 turns. after that all that was left was to head threw another cave that was a huge maze. at one point inside the cave i saved my game... only to do 30 min's worth of fighting and looking for a way out later, that when i found the way out, and after another part where story stop's you for nothing, i went to a spot where 2 unescapable boss-like monster killed me and i had to start from my last save.\n\nafter makeing it out of the cave again i found another cave boss. i save and tried to fight them... i did no damage and they killed my party with one spell. As for the skills i get in this game such as telepathy which just move's unreachable item's to me or knowledge of enemies which tells me about monster's weakness, they were not all that helpfull. I don't even want to know why some mosnters are weak to claw's, other's to axe's, maybe something to sword's, just wtf is the point of that, there all sharp weapon's.

To get more powerful when even the final boss was trivial?\n\nOverall: 7/10 if you absolutely love games in this style, and I do.  4/10 if you just like them.  1/10 if you think they're just OK or worse.\n\nWorth the $5 I paid.  YMMV.","November 27, 2015","true","34.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've played lots of RPGMaker games and several Aldorea games. Aldorea games are enjoyable but they usually stick to their game mechanics with each game which i personally don't like. To explain:  The biggest peeve i have with Aldorea games is that they hide way too much stuff; areas, rooms, gear, items, money. This leads to 2 problems. With such a large amount of hidden things they force you to buy the guide to be able to get a complete game experience with their games forcing more money out of customers. The other thing this leads to is searching every nook and cranny which quickly becomes boring and tedious. Not to mention a huge amount of unnecessary wear on a controller. Another thing they tend to do is have random encounters which becomes frustrating because it ruins your ability to explore. While exploring you are frequently thrown into battles and when its over your left with remembering what you were doing and what you have already done. They do this mostly with their earlier games. The last thing they tend to do is allow missing during combat. What makes the combat enjoyable is being able to implement strategies but it screws off your carefully planned strategy when your big killer blow that would drop them misses and since they are still alive they swiftly proceed to kick you in the nards and now you are taking damage and what not when you had a solid plan - this to me takes out most of the strategy for the player and is frustrating and annoying. Even after all that they are still enjoyable games for the money. I mean, how can you not have fun. I have been playing video games since pong, com64, asteroids, i was there. All that time, my first and last love has always been old school turn-based rpg games and I really love RPGMaker games. These kind of games have it all- Exploring and dungeon crawling, character and party development, cool equipment, skills, and spells to create a party to your style, quests, adventure, and you even get a story and often enjoyable music. I believe that the only reason that you wouldn't have a good time is that for whatever reason you decide you don't want to because even though during play there are some things I don't like I always have a great time. Don't poo-poo on old school RPG games and RPGMaker games, they are always fun and if you don't like them, I think it's more on you than the games. I really hope that Aldorea and all the other RPGMaker game developers continue to keep pumping out games forever. Even though they can improve they still put out very enjoyable games. I appreciate all the hard work that they put into what they do. I have talked to the developers and they put their hearts and souls into these games, earning a living doing what they love. My hats off to all involved. These games are inexpensive and a great value for the gaming hours to price ratio. Love it!!!","January 19","true","99.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There they meet Grom - a dwarf who tells them that someone has opened up Pandora's Box and let out plagues to destroy their home and only earthlings with souls can save it. So begins a story that depicts friendship, trust, dependancy. loyalty and sacrifice as each character grows and develops throughout the story. The game itself is a long game taking the player through many areas on a world map. There are 99 hidden areas and 51 hidden magical rooms to find. Some areas are only assessible once  so saving often is a must. Saving can be done on the world map but in dungeons and some parts only faries can be used to save and full heal with these cost gold. A guide  is a must if you wish to find all the hidden areas.\nThere is a 4 level option- starting at story mode and a choice of step encounters for enemies. Combat system is mostly the same as other early rpg's  and Grom can learn a skill that helps with enemy knowledge.\nThere is a skill list to customise and improve the party- some of the skills are only available to 1 member and specialized skill for their chosen weapon. Each member can choose 1 0f 2 weapons to use ( these cannot be changed throughout the game but  of course you can re-play the game using the other weapon or level). Skills are available from hidden areas and talking with npc's. each skill has 3 levels - expert, master and guru\nThe ending is rather sad and does leave the player with many questions to be answered. It would have been wonderful if the dev, could have made a second game to follow on from the ending to tie up loose ends.\nThe overall graphics are beautiful as is the music and a lot of effort was put into the making of the game.\nThere is a lot of walking in the game and returning to the same areas until you get the airship which then makes moving around the world map much easier.\nIt is not a dungeon - slogging game more a discovery and exploration type.\nOverall it is a great game to play and I would recommend it to players\nWhat I did not like about the game was the unseen enemies - even though you can choose the number of step encounters it still felt like a hassle with the enemies.","February 2","true","53.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This game is a complete masterpiece that offers a marvelous storyline that is long and involved featuring excellent character development, interesting plot lines, tons of exploration, and, of course, great battles with a huge arsenal of monsters to deal with.\n\n\nAs with all rpgs, so much depends on the story being told. And this tale of dwarves that summon humans to fend off the plagues being released by the opening of Pandora's box (where and by whom to be discovered) is captivating from the very beginning. You are drawn in to the story immediately, and the adventure and its goals are made clear at the outset. So you are off to discover what is going on in Asguaard, and the adventure sprawls over a huge land without ever becoming tedious. In fact, there is so much to see, so much to discover and accomplish, and so many variables that the game becomes one of those "just one more scene" type of games. It is very hard to find a point where you feel ok taking a break.\n\n\nPart of any good story is the presentation of the characters, and these are ones that are fun, well thought out, and unique. Even the NPCs (dwarves, fairies) are integral to the plot, and almost always offer help or guidance in your journey.\n\n\nMusic and sounds of the game are remarkably done, and add to the game beautifully.\n\n\nThe artwork (main screens, backgrounds, monsters) are all appealing.\n\n\nWith 4 modes of difficulty (including story mode), over 150 secret locations, and lots of attack variations, the replay value is high. I am playing the story mode primarily, and have also started another game on "Normal", and the differences mean I'll go through the game twice.\n\n\nThe gameplay is smooth as can be with no glitches whatsoever. The text is laid out in a manner that you can easily follow through on what to do next and when to do it. (And not a single misspelling to be seen).\n\n\nThe high production value, and the care that went into this game are obvious and outstanding. Aldorlea's Asguaard is a high quality classic that deserves to be in any collection. Very highest recommendation.\n","April 12, 2015","true","9.2"," 32 of 71 people (45%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","45","32","71","4","0"
