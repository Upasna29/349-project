Apparently they think it's acceptable to brick users' systems and expect us to put in the time and work required to research and fix it.\n\nTo that end, in the hopes of mitigating the loss to others, I will go one better and at least provide a shortcut to anyone in need of a solution: when the installer fails with an error message, open Task Manager (from Ctrl-Alt-Del menu) to terminate the dotnet* process before closing the installer (this prevents the imminent reboot that will otherwise happen), and then download and run the NetFXRepairTool from Microsoft to stop the installer from running again on the next boot.\n\nNote, however, that Steam will still not see a complete installation, and you will need to terminate the dotnet* process again when you try to run the game in order to get past the setup stage.","June 3, 2015","false","1.3"," 65 of 84 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","65","84","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bucchus/recommended/299440/","bucchus","Bucchus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bucchus/","1045 products in account","From the creators of several excellent Unreal Tournament mods comes a retail game that feels like... an Unreal Tournament mod. A good, polished mod but for 15 eurobucks?\n\nThere's two chesspiece armies fighting it out in melee, every piece is a different class with different weapons and abilities. In most modes you gain points from killing enemies which you can either spend on passive skills or save them to spawn as more powerful chesspieces. Of course, the pieces are not equal and killing a queen with a pawn is difficult and rewards you with more points.\n\nThe arena deathmatch modes are fine but if you've ever played UT(3) in melee-only you'll soon notice that despite the new character models and levels it feels just like UT combat with no guns. I find Unreal Tournament's melee janky and prefer something like Mount & Blade or Chivalry when it comes to swinging swords. I don't know if the online side is populated since I played this with bots and like in UT, playing with bots customized to one's level works fine.\n\nThe more surprising gamemode is Combat Chess which is actually quite similar to Archon if you're familiar with it. Two almost-but-not-quite-identical armies play on a normal chess board, but when a piece attacks another they're moved to a dueling arena where you assume direct control of your piece and fight to the death, with nice gory decapitations. I think this is the most unique side of the game.\n\nThere's also a real chess mode if you want something like Battlechess where you can watch the pieces fight it out on the board that is soon covered in blood.\n\nThe game itself looks nice and plays well if you enjoy Unreal Tournamenty combat with a nice suite of mutator customization options, but I'm not sure if it's worth the full price. You can get Unreal Tournament 3 for far less and install melee and gameplay changing mods to your heart's content.","December 18, 2014","true","4.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/a2bradjan/recommended/299440/","a2bradjan","DecryptedGaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/a2bradjan/","636 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n*NOTE: This is an Early Access review meaning it will be a lot shorter than a normal review but will still explain what I thought about it. A full review will be published once Rooks Keep has released.\n\nWelcome to the official blood and gore feast! Rooks Keep is an arena-based, melee combat game. A variety of game-modes, characters, maps and mutators are available. It also has Chess modes, mod support and decapitation! It's available on Steam for and is being published and developed by RuneStorm.\n\nRooks Keep is a very gory, but very entertaining fighting game. It all starts out with how well done the combat system is. There are three main parts; attacking, defending, and parrying. There are light attacks and heavy attacks, each with their own spot on your mouse. You use your mouse for most of the actions you're going to do, whether it's attacking or parrying (defending is a control on your keyboard, which is still easy to use). The tutorial allows people to learn the controls very quickly, but people will figure out that the controls are hard to master, due to the varying moves that the AI/other players throw at you.\n\nThat's another thing. The AI that you face is pretty darn good at the combat system. Although it can be improved for every game mode, it will definitely give you a challenge. You may be able to take on one AI at a time, but when you get bombarded with two or three at a time; you're going to die a headless warrior. There are also multiple different classes to choose from, which gave me a sense of freedom. The skill points, which go into play with what class you can choose, reminded me of Star Wars: Battlefront 2. In Battlefront 2, you had to have enough points to play as a certain class and it is the same here. That being said, the unlockable classes aren't necessarily better because certain classes -with the right enough skill- have the potential to defeat them. That also goes with every class and that sets up a weird "rock-paper-scissors" element to it that I haven't seen in any other arena combat-based game. To add on, you can also use the skill points to add extra, helpful "tiers" to your character that will allow for a stronger fighter.\n\nThe last thing that really got my attention was all the game modes given. For an arena combat-based game, you'd expect the typical team deathmatch and deathmatch gamemodes. RuneStorm went the extra distance and introduced a chess game mode and a combat chess game mode. The combat chess is my favorite because you get can go toe-to-toe as a pawn fighting the queen of the other team and you might even win the fight! There are also a few other game modes including Conversion, Last Man Standing, and even Team Last Man Standing. For all these game modes, RuneStorm provided a "Mutators" tab where you can alter game options and change it to how you would like it whether you want powerups, slomo enabled, or even for combatants to run.\n\nThe only issues I had were a few texture pop-ins here and there with the ground and the player models. As I stated above, the AI will provide for a challenge, but they can definitely be smarter.\n\n8.5/10 - You can view it here: http://encryptgames.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/rooks-keep-early-access-game-review/","July 15, 2014","true","24.9"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"
