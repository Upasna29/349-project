"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/recommended/375180/","bloodravensid","Blood Ravens - AWAY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/","926 products in account","I don't recommend this game.\n\nThe premise of this game is simple, a tycoon game. But as with many other tycoon games, most of them fails to deliver what is the "tycoon" itself, or what is resource management itself.\n\nHere is why the game still need to improve :\nNo competition. There is no competition at all, it looks like you are the only one selling lunch in the island.\nNo long term business model. In tycoon games, the primary income of us should be the profit of selling goods or services. Or from re-selling other person's product or services. In this game, your primary income is awards from events, such as "Best Lemonade" or something like that.\nWrong micromanagement. In this game, we must adjust how much sugar, water, and lemonade in each glass of lemonade. While this seems fun, it is not. It is not fun because it is not related to the economic model. If you add some sugar, there is no increase of your "cost of goods sold", while it should be. If you reduce the amount of lemonade, your cost of goods sold should decrease, but it is not. Furthermore, this wrong micro-management only applies when you are going to enter to an event. People on the street still don't care whether you use excessive sugar or you use not enough water.\nNo satisfaction model. Yes, if you increase the price people will refuses to purchase the product, but it is not clear enough. The above micro-management (managing the ingredients of the lunch item) is fun only if it is tied to the satisfaction of the customer. For example, if you use only few lemonades, the customer should refuses to buy your product. Or the customer would still buy if price is low enough. But that kind of thing does not happen in this game.\nNot enough data on nearly everything. You get a data on your profit each day. How profit is calculated? Unclear. Do you pay wages or something? Tax? No information at all. How much lemon is sold that day? How much candy is sold that day? Unclear. How to level-up and gain access to more expensive items? No information. How "high" is the traffic if I purchase a better food truck? Unclear.\nIt have boring music and boring animation. I don't mind this, actually. But considering the above points failure, this game is not recommended.\nWhat is right on this game :\nIt is cheap.\nIt have interesting concepts, food truck is something fun to think about.\nIt is easy, casual game. Note that some people (including me) will not be happy if the game is too easy.\nThis game is not recommended.","October 7, 2015","false","0.5"," 81 of 95 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","81","95","0","4"

My reviews will either be very positive or very negative.\n\nHowever, in the case of Lunch Truck Tycoon things are a little different. Although I anticipated I would need more time to write a fair review, I only required 30 minutes of gameplay, as shown on my record.\n\nThe game is only $0.99 USD. Sometimes we get what we pay for, but in this case, Lunch Truck Tycoon offers just a little more than $0.99 of entertainment.\n\nI've would've gladly paid $20.00 for this game if there had been more strategy and customization options.\n\nI hope that the developer has plans to expand on this game. I would definitely like to see some improvements via purchasable "add-on's" that increase the need for more strategy, and add more customization. Lunch Truck Tycoon should've been an "Early Access" game.\n\nWill we see a Lunch Truck Tycoon 2 in the future? I hope so!\n\nThe development of "Food Truck" themed games has been neglected and is, in my opinion, an untapped oil well that would seriously appeal to the people who enjoy playing "simulation, management, strategy" games.\n\nThe game's artwork/graphics are of moderate quality. The animation and gameplay are smooth and moderately clean.\n\nIn closing, if you can afford $0.99 USD, buy the game and support an indie developer! In return, you'll receive a little more entertainment than what you paid for, and you can't have a legitimate complaint about that.","May 30, 2015","true","3.9"," 64 of 84 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","64","84","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/threeohfour/recommended/375180/","threeohfour","Ben ^_^","http://steamcommunity.com/id/threeohfour/","168 products in account","I have often dreamed of having my own lunch truck from which I could sell delicious lunches to happy people attending fairs, or on their lunch break, or relaxing in the sun at the beach. My friend Ian and I discussed it for several months at one point, even planning out our ideal lunch routes and giving our theoretical burger bus the title "Well I'll Be Burgered", a name both cheeky and fun and redolent of the hot, delicious foods within. Sadly, his wife vetoed this idea, and I went on to get a job making computer games, and our dream of a food truck selling the most delicious of take-out meals was not to be.\n\nHappily, there is Lunch Truck Tycoon. My girlfriend purchased this for me with the belief that I would be a good 'Burger Man' and I hope that I will not fail her. I like the colourful graphics, the range of locations and the way that different areas change popularity depending on which day of the week it is. I have a carefully calculated chart in my notebook detailing which food items sell best in which areas of the city, to take advantage of the special opportunities, and I have big dreams of upgrading to 'The Lunchinator', the largest lunch truck available to me, at some point, should my lunches prove popular enough with the fine citizens of this town.\n\nI must say, though, that the competitions are quite difficult, and I'm not quite good at them yet. Yes, my more efficient storage system was purchased with funds gleaned from the winnings of one of these competitions, but I also feel that more feedback would have been much more helpful, as I've purchased the sign that attracts more customer feedback and still do not feel I am given adequate amounts in order to competently tackle these challenges.\n\nBesides, lunch should not be a contest. It should be a celebration; of food, of life, of flavour and culture and the joy of eating a tomato, cheddar, salt and pepper sandwich on toasted wheat bread in the sun with someone you care about. With an iced tea on the side, perhaps.\n\nIn summary, this is a fine food van simulation. I find it more engaging than the likes of Ice Cream Tycoon Deluxe, and will keep selling my tasty, nourishing wares to the proud, noble people who visit my truck in the hopes that one day, I too shall be able to call The Lunchinator my own, and in doing so, will rest easy in the knowledge that I am the greatest lunch truck entrepeneur I can be.\n\nDine well, my friends.","August 14, 2015","true","6.2"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","24","28","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/borleskort/recommended/375180/","borleskort","Din","http://steamcommunity.com/id/borleskort/","633 products in account","Lunch Truck Tycoon takes place on a dystopian, late-capitalist island known as Lunch Island; a horrible place where the same 20 second song is played over loudspeakers on loop at all locations. The days pass by in a rushed blur, yet it is always lunch time on Lunch Island. Strictly segregated by socioeconomic class, the island population is comprised of hunderds of silent and exhausted clones stemming from the same 5 or 6 white people and one brown man in a gray suit, creating an uncomfortable and unsettling atmosphere as you see the same person walk past your truck dozens of times per day. Scared of clowns? Get used to it, 20% of the island's economy seems to be from the clowning industry. The insane dictator they call "Mayor" will randomly threaten to ban products from lunch island for no reason, such as soda, though he seems to have a short attention span and never follows through on his threats, whether you successfully rally the island in protest by selling 10 soda's in 3 days or not.\n\nYou COULD pay less than a dollar for Lunch Truck Tycoon, further funding Mayor's regime of white supremacy and capitalist tyranny, or you could play something with just as much, if not more, depth for free on any flash game site.","September 25, 2015","false","3.4"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","75","27","36","34","0"

In some related tycoon games, you're purchasing ingredients and are trying to get it right so that you can sell better stuff and make more money. For this one, all you are doing is just restocking and selling it; so there is no creativity involved. There are events where you can try to be creative, but even then it isn't fun and it's all guesses. Also, the upgrades are hard to obtain. Not all the upgrades are available, you need to level up in order to unlock them. The food trucks upgrades are all available, but they are very expensive. In this game, it takes forever to get enough money to get a better truck. Getting a better truck doesn't even do anything; all it does is make more room to put food in your truck. The days are short, so you don't make a lot of money. I literally had to way months until I had enough money to upgrade once. There are events so that you can get extra money and it is a huge help, but you are still a bit away from coming close to buying a new truck. I only play about 2 hrs. worth of the game and I think I'm already done.

Like seriously, this game operates in a very similar manner. The problem I have with it though is the fact that you can't change the prices like you could in Lemonade Stand. In LS you'd also have to worry about inventory, having enough without wasting too much money and not wasting money on extra bags of ice if you didn't need it etc etc. This game more focuses on getting more money to buy more menu items and only selling certain items in certain areas and certain days of the week when the right people are coming through. It's less economic management sim and more luck based situational management sim... if you know what I mean. I'm on the fence for recommending this game because it's not that bad but it's not that great.

This review will act as my first impressions of the game, so if you are looking for an in-depth review, this is not the one.\n\nOk, so this game is very fun. Yes, it is quite simple, but it is still an amazing game IMO. Working my way up through the truck ladder is a great experience. I'm still currently with the starter truck, but I'm getting close to an upgrade. The gameplay is like Lemonade Tycoon or whatever the game was called. It is very easy to learn how to play, so a long, drawn out tutorial or walkthrough guide is not needed. The pricing component is a very crucial and GREAT part of the game. I have played many tycoon games in my day, and I always felt that a pricing slider/option was needed to make the game great. The developer did a really great job on that part.\n\nNow, yes this game is amazing, but it still has its issues. An options menu isn't currently in the game, and that is a problem for me. A resolution option also needs to be added.\nThis is a smaller problem for me and many others, but the song is very repetitive and later on down the road, maybe the developer can add more music. But I personally listen to Spotify while I play games like these, so it isn't that big of a deal to me.\n\nAlso, I love games with achievements. It makes the playing experience alot better for me. So, in future updates, it would be nice to have achievements.\n\nGreat game and idea. Props to you!","July 13, 2015","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's not worth your full attention, but this is a fun game to have on the side while other things are going on.\n\nThe player slowly builds up a food truck, unlocking levels, which in turn unlock different foods and tools.  These upgrades are linear, but the progress is rewarding enough.  This is no idle-game, but it's pretty base.  The player preps a day of food sales, picks a location, hits go and the day progresses.  The player needs to pay attention to a virtual cell phone that alerts HOT SPOTS, where sales might be better than the cuurent spot.\n\nOtherwise, the cell phone indicates 2 types of challenges.  A quick or slow response challenge based on a food and degrees of Rock, Paper, Scissor.  For example, if the challenge is to make the best Coffee in town over 4 days, the player manipulates Coffee,  Milk, and Sugar between 0-15.  A winning combination might be 12-3-10, or whatever.  But the player need to pay attention to passersby who offer on-screen comments like, "Too much Coffee," or "Fantastic Milk!"  Basically, it is the children's game of "Hotter or Colder."\n\nSUMMARY: This is not a tycoon game by any means.  This is not an idle-game.  It's a weird hybrid that requires attention every 5-10 minutes.  There's nothing to do in the middle.  Only buy of you need a simple-time waster.\n\n","September 8, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That being said, there is need for some consideraton as to how you act in this game.\nMy minor gripe with this game however is that you do not really make your cash from selling stuff, the big monetary income comes from various challenges given to you. Graphics is nothing special, but they do not need to be either as that is not what this game is about.\nBasically you have a certain amount of room in your truck (bigger trucks have bigger storage), and have to decide which goods you want to try to sell. Some stuff sells better in certain locations etc (however why hot beverages sell so well on the beach I do not know).\nA fun games for a few hours, nothing special in terms of positive or negative, but for the price it is at, I will say it is worth the cash (way cheaper than a ticket to a movie, and more hours in return).","July 10, 2015","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Casual Fun --- yes, the game is engaging on the premise of the lunchtime catering truck that is struggling to establish itself and grow.  The graphics are...average for this sort of game, not bad, but not impressive enough to elicit a nod of approval at first glance.  The figures of the customers are a bit below standard actually, looking more like the inhabitants of the streets of the 'PAPERBOY' Franchise, i.e.... blocky and non-descript.    Most of the gameplay is easy to learn, I was able to grasp the basics in less than 3 minutes.  The Text Instructions that popup at the very beginning of a game make a very direct connection to each area of info on the screen.   No long explanations, but most functions become apparent very quickly.   Overall, an enjoyable title.  Kudos to the designer for a fairly clean, uncluttered game that does what its made to do.            ....now  here comes my ..HOWEVER\n\nHowever  (see I told you it was coming), Lunch Truck Tycoon loses some of its allure from being perhaps "too" clingy to the idea of  providing a somewhat 'reaslistic' simulation of the Lunch Truck Catering business.   After 6 hours of playtime,  my Lunch Truck Persona is still struggling to get to the first lunch truck upgrade.   I have been able to afford three equpment upgrades, bhut the costs of those pieces of equipment keep placing me further and further away from upgrading my truck  ( and I am only putting into consideration that I am attempting to purchase the FIRST of 6 truck upgrades --- the ultimate Lunch Truck being the 'Lunchinator' at a staggering $195K).   Now... Considering that I am selling chips, slices of pizza...cans of soft drinks, and candy canes,  I am sure that you start to see the problem.  After six hours of playtime, I only have $8623.00 saved...  If Lunch Truck Tycoon suffers from a major flaw, it is certainly that it attempts to be much too economically accurate.\n\nWhen I considered submitting this review, I went back to the Store page and noticed something .... interesting.  On the sample pages of In-Game visuals is a 'sample'  of the Inventory Page within the game.   This Invenotry Page is where the player can order more items to re-stock their Lunch Truck, and set prices for the items to be sold.  However on closer inspection at the upper right hand corner of that sample page, I noticed.....  the Designer has obviously been 'doctoring' his/her own game, since the screen shows that He/or She has amassed more than $249,000 before reaching Level 12.\n\nNow, I played for 6 hours... reached level 23, and have less than $10K.    So, here is a little "Shame on You"  to the game designer for being a bit deceptive about the actual gameplay.   But, the game is entertaining, but so frustrating in not being able to advance, that its playability is extremely limited right now.  It seems very 'fixable' however, and I certainly hope that the Designer reads this and works to come up with an active solution to this dilemna.\n\nOne other negative to the game is that I am playing on a PC .. using a mouse/keyboard option, and on the MENU Inventory Screen I am unable to scroll, page down, arrow down, jump down turn around, pick a bale of cotton......  until, I got advice from a 12 year old relative that plays Android games a lot, they advised me to treat the screen as if it was a tablet or cellphone needing a 'flick'.\n\nSo by flicking upwards with my mouse I am able to finally see the lower section of higher priced menu items to purchase/resupply.  This made a lot of difference in my gameplay, so I am now editing my review to a positve.. and hoping the Designer can add some other features to spiceup the sluggish gameplay experience.
