"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/recommended/385860/","zerathos","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/","1102 products in account","Normally twin stick shooters aren't really my thing. I've gotten decently into a few of them (most notably Beat Hazard), but I'm not the sort of person who can top leaderboards, and twin sticks are usually all about efficiently racking up the best possible score. I suppose you could say I'm on friendly terms with the devs though, so when they (full disclosure here) gave me a key for the game to test something for them I decided I'd put the game through its paces and let them and you all know what I thought about it.\n\nThe first thing that stuck out to me was how well-designed the enemies are. A lot of twin stick shooters end up feeling the same to me because the enemies are usually few and the strategies to handle them are similar. With this game, however, they constantly throw new enemies at you, some building on old concepts and some introducing radically new approaches. I'm far from an expert on the genre, but I've played my fair share of these games and I've run into some particularly novel enemy behaviors I've never seen combined in quite the same way before. One of the early types that stood out to me was the Bull, a large ship that takes a few seconds to lock on before charging at you in a straight line, exploding if it hits a wall. Depending on the situation you might want to shoot it down, get in close and use the Explosion ability to make shooting it down faster, or just avoid it entirely and let it crash into the wall. Each enemy is usually handled differently, and the way they constantly evolve enemy variety and group up enemies in different combinations keeps your head constantly in the game without leaving a second to get bored.\n\nOne of the cooler curveballs the game throws at you is the stealth servers. There's an enemy type that will track your movements so long as you fire, and will go to your last known location when you cease firing. They start you with this one basic element, then start adding enemies that can reveal your position if you get close, or be able to come after you once enough time has passed, similarly to a Bull. Mixing in normal enemy types allows for even more possibilities. Running around while the whole world is coming down on your head, finding an escape and letting all the enemies gather around your last position, then gunning them down as they whirl back on you is incredibly satisfying.\n\nWith all that said though, the game's certainly not perfect. For example, in Level 4 you're thrown against a boss that more-or-less requires one specific loadout. I threw my face into its fist a few dozen times before I gave up, quit out, changed my equipment and went through the whole level again. The boss features one to three (they get added as you hurt it) spinning invulnerable rings with holes to shoot through. I went into the stage with the starting loadout, but the regular gun shoots too wide to be useful against the small holes (I switched to the more focused Machine Gun), the ship moves too slowly to get around the boss sometimes (switched both perks to ship speed), and the timing to get a shot through all three barriers by the end  is extremely tight (I switched to the Freezing Bomb to hold it in place). With the loadout tailored to the boss I was able to deal with it with much less frustration.\n\nI also found that I don't really like most of the equipment the game has to offer and usually stick with the most basic options. For the main gun especially the standard weapon felt the most effective. The others seem to offer a better risk:reward ratio and higher skill ceiling, but (in my hands at least) they don't feel as potent, nor have the same kind of variety the enemies do. The machine gun and missiles, for example, seem to be practically the same thing.\n\nIn a lot of ways I feel Tachyon Project is similar to Super Toy Cars, the dev's previous game. It had some rough edges, but it did what it did extremely well. In the case of Super Toy Cars, they absolutely nailed handling, making the driving experience fun and engaging. Here we see much the same thing: there's a strong focus on the mechanics, in making sure that every single second of gameplay keeps the player hooked. There's a story, but honestly it's entirely skippable (both figuratively and literally). The art is passable, does its job and little beyond that. Music's okay too, though nothing really spectacular. But what really sells this game, and why you should play it, is because it's just so much fun. I've never played a twin stick shooter that felt more active and alive than this one.","July 17, 2015","true","2.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The scoring method is inversed.  So instead of shooting things to increase your score and picking up their gems to increase your multiplier, you shoot things to increase your multiplier and pick up gems to increase your score.\n\nI kind of prefer the way scoring is handled in vanilla Geometry Wars, but this way is completely valid.\n\nThe parts that expand on the Geometry Wars formula is with the ship's configuration.  You need to advance in the game to unlock new weapons and augments, but essentially you can create a custom loadout for your ship, which is also pleasantly necessary as the game progresses (instead of just being a thing you can do with no purpose).\n\nFor instance, instead of your standard mini-spread gun pattern, you can opt for a more narrow but faster shot, like a machine gun.  Or you can go even tighter and with a higher frequency and have a laser.\n\nVanilla Geometry Wars gives you Bombs, Tachyon Project gives you bombs as well.  But they aren't level destroyers, they just do a spread of damage.  It doesn't necessarily have to kill your enemies, just injure them.  Or you could opt to do one set of bombs and one set of proximity mines, or freezing bombs.\n\nAdditionally, you get two augments to complete your loadout.  Augments such as fire faster, do more damage per shot, your ship goes faster, etc.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention is the timer.  The timer has two mechanics attached to it.  One is that it's your health.  You can gain health/time by defeating enemies.  The second is your bombs/secondary weapons use 1 second per use (each secondary weapon has a cooldown, so you can't just spam it forcing yourself to die.)\n\nBottom line: Tachyon Project is a well done Geometry Wars clone, mechanics-wise.  The visuals and sound are not up to par though.\n","July 22, 2015","true","25.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Each enemy type has a distinct look. There are various particle effects when you fire your ship’s weapons and when when enemies explode. The backgrounds and menus also look great.\n\nAudio\n\nThe sound is quite good. The ship and enemies and your weapons have different sounds depending on what you’re using. Also the music can be quite relaxing. The music ramps up during the more intense parts of the game. The electronic music soundtrack fits well with the game and sounds great.\n\nGameplay\n\nTachyon project is a very solid dual-stick shooter. The game features full controller support and the controls are very responsive. The game is also playable using a keyboard and mouse but I would recommend using a controller. I played using a wired Xbox 360 controller. The game is split into two modes, a story mode and a challenge mode. In story mode you complete waves in each chapter resulting in a final wave. The waves in each chapter leading up to the final introduce new enemies. Each wave has a goal that must be achieved before moving on. These goals range from defeating a certain amount of a particular enemy type to surviving for a set amount of time. There are also cut-scenes in the game featuring a graphic novel feel with very good artwork.\n\nThroughout the game you can unlock different upgrades for your ship. These include new weapons, increased speed, increased health and so on. I like that mines are one of the possible upgrades. The proximity mine is especially fun to use. Drop one near a large group of enemies to wipe out a ton of them with one attack.\n\nThe challenge mode is fun as well. These challenges include a limitless mode where you try to survive for as long as possible, a stealth mode as well as a timed challenge. Online leaderboards are also included.\n\nOverall\n\nOverall Tachyon is a very solid and competently made dual-stick shooter. Whether you want to play a quick challenge or dive into the story there is something here for everyone. The game works for both short and extended gaming sessions. A great addition to the dual-stick genre.","July 21, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Tachyon Project is a dual stick shooter heavily inspired by classic shoot'em ups. We’ve combined many unique enemy types, a large variety of weapons and power-ups with innovative gameplay to ensure a long lasting challenge and discovery at every new level.\n\nIn Tachyon Project you take control of Ada, a software program that has taken conscience and that was designed to hack into the most secure servers on Earth. After some rather mysterious events, Ada is thrown out of the test server where it was living and out into the Internet, but when she tries to go back there she finds she's unable to. She'll then start a journey to uncover the truth behind what happened to her creators, which she considers her parents. In the process she'll find out that things were a bit more complex than she initially thought.\n\nThe game provides an interesting story mode where you go unlocking new weapons, secondary weapons and perks as you progress and uncover the story behind Ada's creation. But you can also play on challenges that present you with unending hordes of enemies to try for the best score and compete in leaderboards. You can play these challenges either alone or with friends in up to 4 player local multiplayer co-operative games.\n\nTachyon Project also brings new ideas to the table, presenting a new stealth mode in some levels where you have to pick carefully when to shoot to avoid being discovered too early and keep yourself disguised. - Highly Recommended!","August 6, 2015","true","0.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"
