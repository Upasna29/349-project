Can only play against the AI, not against humans.  That wouldn't be so bad, except the AI is awful at poker.  I mean really awful.  For example, the AI telegraphs the strength of their hand by their bet sizing.  Also, donk leads into you after you were the preflop aggressor mean either top or middle pair every time, so you can either bluff raise on overcards or fold if you have no equity.\n\nOverall, it's just a bs cash grab imo.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gamingtrevor/recommended/322950/","Gamingtrevor","Gamingtrevor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gamingtrevor/","203 products in account","To read the full review of this game, please visit Mouse N Joypad; http://mousenjoypad.com/reviews/pc/pure-holdem-review/\n\nreviewing a poker game is actually kinda hard. If you’re reading this review, most likely, you’re already a huge Texas Hold’Em fan, and you know that these games aren’t really different in the big details, but rather in the small ones. I can imagine your primary concern being lag dropping you out of pocket aces. I can happily say, from what I played, I didn’t see many problems with the core online gameplay. The game runs smoothly, and I never experienced any dropouts.\n\nThe biggest fault Pure Hold’Em has, as any poker game does, is it doesn’t feel any different. It’s sadly the same game you’ve been playing for years. That’s at no fault to VooFoo Studios, that’s simply because you have a very simple game, that has set rules, and can’t be changed up or ‘innovated’. So, my review really has to come down to the smallest of details.\n\nSomething I really disliked was the fact that your opponents are electronic tablets sitting on a table. There’s no human models, no shadowy figures throwing chips- it’s a mini Facebook profile, with generic stock images as your opponents. Even worst, there’s no way to change your image, so any online opponents you meet display a generic cutout image. I should be able to make a profile, and use an image to represent my icy play style. Sadly, this is absent, leaving no shred of character in your seat.\n\nThere’s also no in-room chat. I know some don’t want that, and would rather play the numbers game, but I do enjoy talking with random people while playing poker. The game is void of interactivity with your fellow players. I’m dying for the day when I can stare someone down through webcam, and you can pick up on someone’s tells. Aren’t we all sitting at the same table; shouldn’t we be able to at least talk to one another?\n\nThe music is quiet enough that it does feel like a secluded casino, and the warm glow of unused slot machines surround the table. It does provide a nice ambiance, and Pure Hold’Em has set up a great mood with dim overhead lights, calming music and light sound effects. When the game wants to build tension, the camera pans into a slow motion reveal of the river, as the card slowly flips over. The overall experience is greatly increased through the game’s execution of tone.\n\nThe graphics are nice, and the camera floats around the table smoothly, keeping the flow going continuously as the hands are played out. The chips are stacked quickly, and there’s nothing that really slows down the action. For a such a beautiful game, it plays like one of those fast paced online options, but with a stunning presentation.\n\nFinally, the in-game purchases, or as I’d like to call it, “pay to sit at the big boys table.” Want to actually play with people who won’t try bluffing every hand, than pull out your wallet again and pay for the privilege. I can understand playing with money on the line can add some excitement, but we’re not playing online poker- this is a video game. The reward should be getting to the Masters table, and picking up little perks along the way (maybe some customization of the absent avatars). Alas, it’s not a big deal- maybe people just like buying people at their table a pair of sunglasses or a fish with real money. Seriously, are we still doing the whole, “gift” system in these games? Can’t we have something more useful- like voice chat!?\n\nBeing a poker fan, I feel confident in recommending this newest entry. It’s fast-paced, visually dynamic, and offers a great atmosphere in a reserved casino. The game however does feature some bizarre choices, such as playing against small electronic screens instead of people. The options are also lacking, at least until they allow you to buy different sets of cards. The game also has a pay-to-play element, that makes this feel less simulation, and more like a real casino. The game also has no voice-chat, or even chat, making the table feel void of personality. If you’re in need of some hands though, this will fit the bill- even if you feel lonely playing it.\n\nThank you for reading my review, and if you'd like to read more, please visit Mouse N Joypad; www.MouseNJoypad.com\n","August 20, 2015","true","6.9"," 23 of 52 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","23","52","0","0"
