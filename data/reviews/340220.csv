"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anrkyuk/recommended/340220/","anrkyuk","anrkyuk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anrkyuk/","538 products in account","Review Updated  8th March 2015\n\nI originaly wrote a review a short white ago and since then the dev was kind enough to message me about a patch addressing some of my concerns. Since I last played there have been two patches.\n\nCurrent observations 15/02/2015\n\nUpon loading game all saved progress has been lost, at last play I had completed the campaign to day 7 I am now back at day 1.\n\nStarted up a skirmish map, as before dead enemy units are still showing on map. Ordered up a bunch of infantry units they stoped moving across the map about 15% of the way across, yet ordered up an MLRS and went all the way. During wave 2 game crashed back to desktop.\n\nGame previously did not crash back to desktop, it just got very slow the longer a game was played ( 1 second took around 3 seconds of real time on sped up mode even worse on normal time progression by wave 16-18 and time between waves starting took around 5 mins in campaign mode, wave start delay seemed ok in skirmish ).\n\nGiven the game crashes back to dekstop so quickly I can not comment on if these issues have been fixed.\n\nThe dev is active which is a good sign and I have hopes that one day I will manage to complete the game.\n\nSadly as of today I can not reccomend this game in its current state.\n\n\n*** 8th March 2015 3rd update to review ***\n\nSo my 3rd time trying this game, I still notice that previous progress is missing, I now presume this lost, along with progress towards acheivements.\n\nStarted up a classic skirmish, ordered up 20 soldiers, they met up with 20 enemy soldiers with a slight crest between and both stood there for 6+ mins with no casualties, didnt seem to be able to shoot each other. Started up skirmish again on a different map, same again ordered up 20 to face off against first wave of 20 enemy soldiers. Again they faced off with a crest between them. I took a screen short of it this time, nearly 13 mins they just stood opposing each other with no casualties.\n\n3rd Time tried skirmish on a flat map, thankfully this time they were able to shoot each other.\n\nI have played the game almost finishing the campaign and never noticed a LoS issue before, during this play test there did appear to be LoS between the troops and bullet animations were clearly showing hits between the units, so unsure if this is a new issue or just random bad lack that has not happened to me previously.\n\nCrashes seem to have stopped. Fair play this was resolved quickly and caused by a patch that was not intended for release.\n\nMini map / radar is still largely pointless and quickly stops indincating your units and then shortly after enemy units.\n\nYour own troops still randomly stop moving across the map bunching up in a mass group, this can lead to loosing a large number of units to a single tank / arty shell.\n\nOnce a large number of troops that had stopped moving and bunched up on the map just vanished ( well behind any fighting and only on 3rd wave no no arty in play on either side ), can't say I noticed that happening before either.\n\nI would classify the current state of the game as working but frustrating. I have not tested the campaign, since Feb so can not comment regarding speed slowdown issues that occoured previously","February 15, 2015","false","13.2"," 41 of 53 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","41","53","2","5"

You spend money to purchase infantry/vehicle/tank/air units where you collide in a head-on battle with your enemy which is doing quite the same.  You only have so much money to work with at the start so you need to spend wisely.  I imagine the game's core enjoyment factor will be it's multiplayer which I have yet to try out.\n\nThe game almost plays itself in a sense, you have no real full control over the units you purchase, just in how many you purchase and when, which is primarily the strategy to the game.  If you purchase a bunch of infantry and your opponent purchases an airstrike, that's going to be a lot of money down the drain wasted on infantry.  Speaking of airstrikes there are several support options, such as carpet bombing, artillery strikes, cruise missiles, etc.  These aren't cheap, but they can take out nasty clusters of heavy armor rather quickly.\n\nThere is also the option to research vehicles, which is good to slow down the progression of a battle so you don't just pound the enemy with the biggest and baddest things you have on offer, and makes you try to manage your money a little more carefully.  I think once the game has the game-breaking bugs ironed out however it'll be a much better playthrough experience.  I'm honestly on the middle grounds for recommending this game or not, and the only reason why I'd lean more towards the negative side of things is only because the current day-skip bug.  Aside from that the game has many redeeming qualities, though I think a little more variance and strategy would help it a lot more.  Possibly in the form of building barricades to slow down enemy advancement or block projectiles, and really turning it into more of a chess-game where certain types of units are absolutely required to best others, because I feel many will just use the "strength in numbers" tactic, which can work, but it is a costly mistake if it doesn't.  Also a refresh timer on support would be a good idea as well, spamming artillery if you have the cash can do most of the work for you.","January 4, 2015","true","1.2"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","11","26","0","0"

Spent 5 minutes trying to get it to work... It didn't.\n\nWhenever I try to start the game skirmish/campaign, the game just freezes on the loading screen, sometimes with the interface/hud of the game overlapping with the loading screen.\n\nI restarted three times and failed all of them before moving on to write this review.\n\nWhat a waste of money, don't get it!!\n\nUpdate: So the creator contacted me and fixed the problem, 10/10 for support.\n\nNow that I can actually play the game, to be honest I didn't really like it. It's just like one of those games you can play on your smartphones, but with worse graphic. There are a few bugs too like how when you fast forward the game, the units won't kill each other. They'll just keep shooting until you change it back to normal speed.\n\nThe game has potential, but as of now I would not recommend it. I could get a better game for free on my phone.\n\nNo offense Conti, just giving an honest review :/","May 16, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Menu navigation didn't work and I had to alt f4 out a few times when it locked up.\n\nI love tug-o-war games, and the art direction of this is something I could enjoy. The execution of the design needs a lot of work. Many issues stand out that make this bad really early on.\n\nThis is what I would expect from day 1 early access... not something from 2014.\n\nTLDR - Refunded.","January 3","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaign is 100% disfunctional, units do not function properly, and are inconsistent in behavior. The developer(s) (IDK) consistently fail to improve or patch the bugs that make this a failing game. Don't be fooled by the trailer, music, or anything else that you may find. This game is worse than even the 74 cents that it is up for right now on steam. Trading cards are a plus. I love these kinds of games, but this is so broken right now it is nearly unplayable. Im sad to see how hard this failed.... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! (even 74 cents)","December 28, 2015","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
