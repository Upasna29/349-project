Itâ€™s an excellent experience in VR, lots of fun, and can become very competitive, very quickly. All of the minigames are well made and the controls are very natural. I found myself picking up how to play the games in less than a minute and this goes for my friends and family also. Overall, this is a great game and I definitely would recommend getting it if you have a Vive.","April 5","true","2.1"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","6","17","0","1"
