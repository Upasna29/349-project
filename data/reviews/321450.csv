For the price, I am blown away, I expected it to be a stinker but it is actually fun to play.  You start off your career with a rusty slow boat and no money and have many ways to earn it.  Racing was too hard right off the bat so I did some taxi runs, then discovered this pirate treasure mode where they just literally scatter the world with money and you just have to collect it all.  Well since there was only a couple of upgrades on the rusty boat I maxed it out and now need to figure out how to get a better one.\n\nSome negative aspects I would say is the limited selection of upgrades on the boat classes.  Maybe things get deep down the road but if the later boats have just one speed and one rudder upgrade I would be disapointed.  Time will tell though as I venture through this title.\n\nAs far as graphics options and settings, this game is fully loaded.  All resolution, texture, effects, sound (including # of voice channels), controls, AA, etc is all here in the launcher.  Everything worked on the first try as well, no crashing or hiccups.  In the game, it looks beautiful but the textures are a bit too low-resolution to be a game from 2015 however, they should work on that as the whole experience would be improved with textures many times larger.\n\n360 controller works out of the box, but there is a chance it needs to be turned on before launching the game and selected in the launcher as the input device, but I can say that you can use both the keyboard and controller for at least navigating menus at the same time, which is nice.\n\nWishlist:\n- Trading cards\n- Achievements\n- Steam Cloud\n- Online multiplayer\n- Higher resolution textures\n\nOverall totally worth the $4 it is currently.","March 25, 2015","true","0.5"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","35","50","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadrunner1/recommended/321450/","roadrunner1","Road Runner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadrunner1/","551 products in account","I bought this game on impulse, because of the low pricetag and the inability to resist. I have to say, I'm positively surprised by what I got. Note that this game was originally released in 2008 (according to the official website) It made it's way through Greenlight and was released on Steam this week.\nIt's an open world boat racing game, wich takes place in 3 area's. You start in Russia and move on to Greece and the Caribbean later. You can also quicktravel between the various locations in the game, once you unlocked them. You navigate to various point on the map to start races, taxi jobs, upgrade and reskin your boat or buy a new one, acquiring sponsors etc. You start your career with a crappy, slow and ugly boat. Races can be a bit dull in the beginning but with the various ways to make money in this game, you can quickly upgrade your boat or buy a new one. The upgrading ability is limited to just a button press for a better engine, to give an example. You can't choose between various parts. At least not where I am now in the game. While racing you can pickup powerups, like nitro or weapons to use against your opponents: rockets, torpedo's, shockwaves, mines, EMP's, oh and off course, bouncing, exploding frogs :)  So if you are looking for a realistic boat racing game, this isn't really your thing. Then there's a mode were you collect golden coins that are spread out over the map. So another way to make money.\nGraphics and sound are decent. Again, considering the pricetag, I'm just satisfied with it. Just don't expect super high resolution textures or cool lighting and particle effects. For some strange reason, the screen ratio in the menu's is 4:3. At least, on my system. However, ingame it all works with the proper resolution and screen ratio that you can configure in the game's launcher. You can set more graphics and sound options there.\nI like the game's physics too. They are not hardcore offcourse but certainly not too arcady. The boats really have some weight to them.\nThe game has 'experimental' controller support but at this moment, you are better of with just the keyboard, wich actually works fine. The 360 controller does work. However, you can't remap the buttons and the layout is a bit odd and unusual. Gas, brake and steering is all done with the left thumb stick. The triggers don't do anything with the boats. I hope the dev will add the ability to remap the buttons in a future update. It's not a huge letdown. Like I said, the keyboard works fine too.\nAll in all, I'm very satisfied with this game, which costs the same as a cup of coffee and a snack. You really can't go wrong with that.","March 27, 2015","true","3.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","2"

It can take some time to get used to driving the lakes. But once you get used to the driving you will have a lot of fun with this game. The game works great with Eyefinity and Surround setups. The music in game is pumping and fun to listen to. The graphics are well done. This racing game is fun for people of all ages.

He was the boating king of Lake Tohochobee. One fateful day, while we were on his boat, he says to me: "Son. One fateful day you're going to inherit my crown. You will become a boating king." Without even looking up from my gameboy, I murmured "that's great". Then something horrible happened. An Arabian Sea Bear burst out of the water, grabbed my father, and pulled him overboard. Then he was bitten by a snake, decapitated by a manatee, eaten by a shark, drowned by a catfish, my mother divorced him, and then he lost his wallet.  The very next day I swore that I would avenge him. I packed my bags, got in my car, and drove to Russia. This is how the story of PepsimanVsJoe: Boating Legend began.\n\nNow if you believed that story, I have an even better one for you. It's about how I got the name "PepsimanVsJoe". It involves Gabe Newell and a Riverboat Casino.\n\nSeriously though, I can't deny the appeal of cruising in a motorboat. Unfortunately, I'm a poor geek who can barely afford his car. Once again I have to rely on videogames. Luckily, there's at least one out there that attempts to capture this great experience: Aquadelic GT. This is an open-world game where you can travel to multiple locations, purchase/upgrade a number of boats, participate in races, and even enjoy some leisurely activities (like hunting for treasure or rescuing flood victims).\n\nAfter choosing your hideous and poorly-dressed avatar, you start off in Russia with a tin-can of a boat. Driving is very fluid, and it captures the right balance between simulation and arcade. The controls take some adjusting, especially if you're using a 360 pad. The throttle is on the same stick as the steering! If anything, the throttle should be on the right stick. Alas, there's no in-game option to change the controls, you'll have to use some third-party software. Otherwise, getting around is well-done.\n\nNow if you want to make some real money, you have to race. This is where Aquadelic GT goes over the deep-end. Now I've watched exactly zero boat races, unless you count the John Candy movie Summer Rental. However. that movie ended with a sailing race, not motorboats. Anyway, the point is that the races in this game are basically Mario Kart. Each track is comprised of multiple check-points, with various weapon-crates and nitrous power-ups sprinkled about. These weapons include torpedoes, EMPs, mines, exploding frogs, and so on. It's ridiculous, entertaining, but also pretty unbalanced.\n\nAll too often, these Kart-racers make the mistake, of not having a solution for the racers that break away from the pack. While everyone is blowing each other up, the one guy that manages to escape the chaos, will pull way ahead and win without any trouble. Nintendo's answer to this quandary was the blue shell, nobody likes the blue shell. Aquadelic GT has no blue shell or "realistic equivalent" to speak of. The racer in 1st has the highest chance of running into mines or nets, but races typically only have two or three laps.\n\nI don't have an answer to this quandary, but I will admit that despite this issue, the races are still really fun. A well-timed explosive can send a number of boats spinning, flipping, and possibly crashing into the shores. Collisions are also handled amusingly. Sometimes if an opponent is closing in as I'm about to make a turn, I'll do a 90 degree turn while killing the throttle. This would probably cause a t-bone accident, but instead it results in my opponent going over me and way off-track. The AI in this game is non-existent, and usually all it takes is one good crash to put them out of the race. It's too bad that the only option for racing with humans is via LAN. Single-player races tend to be too one-sided.\n\nAside from the acquisition of necessary cash for new boats/upgrades, races also lead to sponsorship deals. Basically, sponsors add a flat multiplier bonus to your winnings & popularity. More popularity leads to better sponsors, which leads to more...you get the idea. Sometimes having a sponsor will require that you take on a passenger. For awhile I had a guy dressed like a burger riding in a boat with me. Alright then. Winning races will also unlock new locations. Greece and the Caribbeans look quite nice, for a low-budget game. There's a decent amount of atmosphere, the soundtrack is good, and there are even people hanging out. Just don't look closely, as you'll surely notice that they don't move at all. It's a little unsettling, but even major franchises like Gran Turismo and Forza skimp on the spectator graphics.\n\nAt 4.99, this game will probably last you close to five hours. I might play some more races to see what sort of shenanigans I can cause, or just cruise around while listening to Sweet Freedom. I've already unlocked every location, won every race, and purchased the most expensive boat. I guess I could buy that dream home, or get sponsored by the largest company, but there's not really much else to do. Honestly, I'm fine with that. Aquadelic GT does not wear out its welcome. While it never really excels at what it tries to do, it still delivers an entertaining experience.\n\nIn short, if the idea of driving a boat appeals to you, and you're willing to overlook questionable controls and some head-scratching design-decisions, you'll enjoy Aquadelic GT.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","July 23, 2015","true","4.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"
