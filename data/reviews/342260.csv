It seriously sets the wrong tone as far as what you should expect (particularly in terms of story quality). That said, I love this game. In a time that the market is heavily inundated with low-quality indie cash-ins, Nevermind really shines.\n\nThe concept is this: You're a "neuro-prober", an inception-style therapist that can enter the minds of psychologically troubled clients to help them sort through and ultimately deal with their past traumas. A concept very nicely executed by way of subtle imagery and level design that actually makes sense in the context of the trauma you're dealing with (as opposed to just filling a creepy place with a bunch of zombies and calling it a day). Throw in some pretty great (but not necessarily final-product) voice acting and you've got a pretty atmospheric story and setting.\n\nGameplay mechanic is simple, but intriguing. You collect photographs (no, wait, it's not what you think) that slowly develop a narrative as to the events that led to the client's trauma. You earn each photo after completing a puzzle related to it. When you've collected them all, you're presented with a collage and tasked with arranging certain photos to tell the story while avoiding red herring choices meant to distract you.\n\nScare-wise, the game is pretty tense. Don't expect constant jump scares (well, maybe one or two, but the game hardly relies on them to deliver the fear) but rather a creeping, building sense of dread. Throw in the fact that the game supports a heart-rate monitor mechanic and you'll find your environment changing to compliment your nervousness.\n\nSo far, Nevermind boasts a tutorial and first client, but promises more in the near future (their Twitter feed is constantly abuzz with new information on content updates, screenshots of upcoming areas, etc.). Definitely worth full price if you're looking for a horror game with some genuine effort behind it.","May 29, 2015","true","9.8"," 88 of 97 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","88","97","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oneiropolos/recommended/342260/","Oneiropolos","Oneiropolos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oneiropolos/","460 products in account","If you have not checked out Nevermind, I strongly suggest you do so if you fit under ANY of the following:\n\n*You like Psychological Horror.\n\n*You’re interested in the concept of the subconscious holding clues to aid in therapy.\n\n*You have, or plan to get, a biofeedback device and want to try to take your coping to a game rather than the typical biofeedback software.\n\n*You want to support a game headed by a female developer, created to explore whether games can fully stand on their own but also be used to aid those to whom Biofeeedback is actually helpful.\n\nNevermind prompted me to buy a cheap biofeedback device since I backed it on kickstarter and had early access. The stories are engaging, the biofeedback is fairly reliable. Some people argue that the ‘punish’ system doesn’t work but I think those people don’t actually have an anxiety disorder. When you start panicking in real life, things do start becoming blank to you. Fuzzy. They don’t quite match up. Everything is wrong and harder to figure out. If you get too upset in Nevermind, if you let your heart rate raise too high without paying attention to the warning signs that things are getting weirder, you can sometimes be yanked to a calming area to make you focus on relaxing again. But most of the time, when you start noticing things are harder to see, you can stop, breathe, and make things clearer again. So it’s not actually a ‘punishment’ system. It shifts the game world to the way the real world FEELS when you have an anxiety attack. But if you can calm down, you can see things clearly again and unaltered. You are rewarded for making yourself calm down. All in the safety of your own privacy so none of those humiliating “How many people noticed my brain went off-line just now?” questions.\n\nThe plot of the game is you work for a dream therapy company, essentially. You’re a doctor who uses advanced technology to dive in people’s memories/dreams. What you see there is the product of how the brain creates false memories to deal with traumatic occurrences or over-exaggerates fears in the subconscious. It’s your job to solve puzzles, figure out how to get through the level, stay calm while doing so, and collect ~10 memory “postcards”. At the end of your level, you try to take in what you’ve seen through the level and figure out the five postcards that are the ACTUAL reality of what happened to the patient. The tutorial level is simply a fairy tale to introduce people to the concept. Other levels deal with darker and very real topics but have always tried to be respectful to the sort of trauma they can induce. I’d give examples but if I did that, I’d honestly give away the solution to those levels.\n\nI backed Nevermind because I believed in what she was trying to do - create games that actually can be used to help people like me gain control and yet are interesting themselves. I advocate others check it out because it is honestly a good game even if you DON’T have a biofeedback device to measure your heartrate. They really had to fight an uphill battle to get this game released (the first kickstarter didn’t quite make it) but it’s here now and it’s really well done.","September 29, 2015","true","4.7"," 70 of 87 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","70","87","6","1"

This game has taken a great step up from the early version and is well produced.\n\nNevermind places the player in the mind or subconcious of a stressed patient, one who has suffered a sort of trauma that is still effecting them. Your job is to travel the subconcious mind and put the pieces together, figure out what happened, and help the patient reach clarity or a breakthrough. However, be wary as your presence in the mind is unwelcome, causing the world to fight back to your presence. Can you survive the inner walls of their mind and help them, or will you be consumed by fear?\n\nAs the game stands in Early Access it is a great treat to play, especially with the optional monitors that create your own "fear response" - as you get more scared the gameplay changes slightly, whether increasing difficulty, pushing static onto the screen obscuring vision, or increasing the severity of the world's interactions. If you get too scared, the game pushes you back, forcing you to approach the situation with calm and collected thoughts, a truly unique experience.\n\nEven without the optional monitors, Nevermind plays as a wonderfully surreal horror-adventure game. While only two levels are currently available they are well worth the time and money as a wonderfully unique experience that I hope is only the start from this great developer.","April 1, 2015","true","3.2"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

Of the two patients you work with they are both relateable to some degree or another and you'll end up really feeling for them as you go through their fractured psyche. This is the type of psychological horror game that doesn't rely on jump scares or running from monsters beyond those imagined in the mind. The darkness surrounding everything is indicative of dealing with the pain and the surreal imagery adds that little something to showcase that the mind works in strange ways to try to cope with the trauma. By the end I found myself needing to play something a little more whimsical just to dust the cobwebs of depression out of my own head. My only problem is with the length of the game. With only two patients it's very short. I would have loved to have seen one or two more added to give a little more variety to all the types of mental illness out there. Still, it's worth playing despite the short length.\n\nhttp://www.kickstartadventure.com/home/nevermind-review/\nhttp://cliqist.com/2015/10/21/nevermind-takes-peek-subconscious/\nhttp://cliqist.com/2015/10/23/nevermind-brings-surreal-eerie-images-life/","October 28, 2015","true","2.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

This game is amazing. I was blown away by the attention to detail, you really do have to pay attention and put it all together. This game manages to convey stories in such a unique and powerful way it is truely amazing, However I would like to also say this game does not live up to its true potential. It is VERY short. This is a major con and Almost made me give it a thumbs down. With that being said the only reason I give it a thumbs up is due to the astonishing and unique gameplay. So would I recommend you buy this? Yes, I would even despite the fact it is so short.

This was actually always the amount of planned and promised content. That said, we're incredibly eager to build more levels (we already have several concepts ready for future Clients). Our capacity to build them will depend entirely on how well the game does in the next few months.\n\nIf Nevermind is successful enough to permit the development of an additional level, then the current plan is to provide it as a free download for anyone who has the game.

It left me wanting more. The devs seemed to have a knack for not just scaring you, but thrusting you into a situation that makes you feel down right uncomfortable. The game deals in heavy subject matter but is never disrespectful. One such case you undergo deals with a trauma that is near and dear to my heart. My mother experienced something similar to what this particular 'victim' experienced. I wont spoil it but, theres only two cases here to undergo not including the tutorial. Its the first case you undergo. A the one with the woman experiencing social anxiety i believe.\nWhat I went through to help this patient was harsh and true. It broke me down and all at once i understood what my mother went through. It brought me to tears as i listened to the woman understanding where it all went wrong. The wonderful thing about this game is the end goal. Helping poor souls understand thier trauma and the final words they speak in the mission end sequence that gives you hope that they will find peace. Its something I've never experienced in an indie horror game. Where other games want to hammer home dread. This one seems oddly unique. The scares take a back seat to what the game really wants you to feel, compassion.\nA beautiful, cerebral experience i will never forget.

For me, I've played these same two levels quite a bit since the testing days and I have yet to tire of them. Very much looking forward to future "cases."\n\nNevermind is a journey into the surrealistic, and often horrific, as the player assists each "case" with re-assembling the events of a past trauma. This unique puzzle game can be rather involved depending on the player's approach to the game.\n\nEach environment does an excellent job of conveying mood between what is seen, heard, and even implied - encouraging the player to be highly observant. The puzzles are rather appropriate in relation to their story and overall stress level of the environment. Interpretation of each tramautic experience is beautifully executed and, for me, highly effective. Game control is quite fluid and precise, something I truly appreciated as well.\n\nNevermind has the potential to be valuable for sheer entertainment as well as a therapeutic tool. There is enough eye-candy, basic good design, and challenge (more so with biofeedback I imagine) to appeal to the gamer in me. As for the person who actively uses gaming for therapy, I believe Nevermind to be a very solid step in the right direction.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend folks give this early access of Nevermind a try.

Part way through the second level I realized that I had played that level before, probably during its time as a academic project, although it had evolved beyond that.\n\nI played the first two levels without any biofeedback sensors. Before playing the third I picked up a Polar H7 heart sensor. It was certainly a different experience and I'd want to replay the game with it on but at some times it was almost unplayable for me so I had to disable the fear mechanic.\n\nIt wasn't that I was anxious or afraid or anything like that but rather that my heart rate was high and variable due to a short term condition. At that point no adjustments to the sensor sensitivity helped; it had my baseline at the "yellow" fear level. This is new ground, however, and  the support for the Polar H7 was more recently added so some difficulties are to be expected. I'll update my review once I've had a chance to play when my heart rate isn't all over the place.\n\nIs the game short right now? Yes. It took me about 4 hours to beat it.\n\nIs it well made? Yes. The environments and the narrative are very well thought out.\n\nWas it worth it? For me it was.

What I love about it is that the game relies soley on the atmosphere and (ir)rational fears rather than jumpscares, and that really ups the horror aspect. It's definitely creepy and it has an interesting dream-like ambience to it.\n\nThe puzzles really aren't all that difficult, but it's interesting to just get lost in the idea of it all.","April 1, 2015","true","4.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Well i'm happy to say my first playthtough of this game gave me that same feeling. I could have kicked myself for not picking up on all the clues.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSQCaegDAXo\n\nNevermind is a biofeedback-enhanced horror adventure game that takes you into the dark and surreal world within the subconscious minds of psychological trauma victims.\n\nAs you explore twisted labyrinths and solve the puzzles of the mind, an (optional) biofeedback sensor will monitor your feelings of fear and anxiety with each passing moment. If you let your fears get the best of you, the game becomes harder. If you’re able to calm yourself in the face of terror, the game will be more forgiving.\n\nNevermind’s goal is to create an unforgettable gameplay experience that can help teach you to be more aware of your unique internal responses to stressful situations. If you can learn to control your feelings of stress and anxiety within the disturbing realm of Nevermind, just imagine what you can do when it comes to those inevitable stressful moments in the real world… Recommended!\n\n","May 4, 2015","true","1.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Hopefully developer Flying Mollusk can maintain the level of quality and intensity present in the game so far and deliver a truly remarkable title.

There are 3 Clients to choose from and you have to walk through their subconcious to piece together a traumatic event. I've never played a game like this before but I would IMAGINE and I say that because I haven't played "Gone Home" but I would imagine that Nevermind and Gone Home are similar in playstyle.\nSome of the puzzles were a bit difficult for me, but as long as you pay attention to the tutorial then you should be fine. Also I don't reccomend skipping the cutscenes when learning about a new client as they are... well not essiential to solving the mystery BUT they do provide a good guideline as to what to look for. Everything was very well executed. I found myself caring about each client and feeling accomplished when I figured out what the traumatic event was. The scares probably aren't for everyone as I didn't find my self scared at all with "client 418" but I was quite scared of "client 25" at least I think 25, it was the one with the little girl.\n\nFeatures/ other things worth mentioning\nSadly I did not get to use the "bio sensor" feature which honestly sounded very cool. The controls are VERY simple, in a good way. Any person with basic computer knowledge  could probably go through the tutorial and be 100% capeable of playing with no issue. The graphics are beautiful, however just a heads up I'm playing on an i7 4790k, GTX 780, and 16GB of RAM and at 1920x1200 ( had to play windowed because of my 3440x1440 display) it ran worse than Battlefront does when I play BF @ 2560x1080 @ medium settigns, and by worse I mean both Battlefront and Nevermind had my GPU @ 99% load. I was playing Nevermind @ 1920x1200 windowed and averaged around 60fps but I was noticing it getting choppy, whereas on Battlefront @ 2560x1080 @ medium settings my GPU is still at 99% load but I don't expierence the amount of chopiness I was getting from Nevermind.\nNow I don't know if you can adjust resolution in full screen as I didn't try to until I was in game and my only option was to play full screen or windowed, I know COD won't let you adjust resolution while in game which is why I felt that this was worth a mention.\n\nTLDR: This is a great game, this is infact the first game I've purchased in a while (that wasn't over 50% off on a Steam sale) that I haven't had buyer's remorse about. The graphics are great, the music is awesome, the stories are superb and there's been talk of more content being added, at least that's what the DEV said as long as the launch goes well. So I am looking forward to more content in the near future.

However, just because a concept has been done before does not necessarily mean it's a bad thing, and this game proves that. It delivers on many different feelings, from dread and panic, to hope, salvation, and true accomplishment... if completing puzzles with psychological themes makes you feel accomplished.\n\n\nStory~: With regards to you (and the character you play), you are the newest doctor of the Neurostalgia Institute, skilled in the process of Neuroprobing, which lets you dive into the minds of trauma paitents and go through their sub-conscious minds to uncover what exactly lead them to the facility to be probed in the first place! At the time of this review, there were only three actual probings with puzzles to solve: an introduction story that was created to help aid new neuroprobers learn the tricks of their trade, a young female with scopophobia, and a homeless man taken in by the facility after a public episode.\n\nPresentation~: Like with most horror games, atmosphere is key; if you lack that, your game lacks any true impact. It is fortunate then, that this game definitely delivers on the atmosphere, where it slowly builds up the weight of the dread the [shifting] environments places on your shoulders as you delve deeper into the subconsciousness of the trauma paitents. Unlike the introduction story, the first and second clients you tend to have very serious traumatic experiences that many people may have been unfortunate to deal with, be it a direct cause of their own actions, or being completely out of their hands, and the game treats these issues on a serious note. This dedication to detail of handling the traumatic experiences ties in very well to the gameplay, as well as how small things can have large implications.\n\nGameplay~: This is a psychological horror puzzle game. In every probing you conduct, you will begin in a safety hub that connects you to the rest of the subconscious mind, which includes a large board. This board will house the ten postcard photographs you will earn from completion of the puzzles, which in addition to that, will allow you to go further into the mind and expose the trauma bit by bit. Upon gaining the final postcard photograph, you will need to return to the large board and sort out the postcards so it tells the story of their trauma; only five of the ten tell this tell, the others are included to throw you off until you've gained all ten of them and can really piece it together. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing this review, I do not own a biofeedback sensor, which is an optional input device that would track your pulse to let the game know if you are getting frightened and anxious, punishing you by blurring the world around you if you do not calm yourself down, although they are kind enough that if you get too worked up, they pull you back to a safe room to take a breather and calm down before you return to the task at hand.\nWhen you complete each probing, you are then allowed to replay the probings again, but this time to comb them thoroughly for clues that fill in the missing gaps of the trauma you just uncovered, adding to the game's replayability... and numbing you to the horrors within (except for one room in the first cilent's house; you'll know it when you encounter it...). The combing process will require you to reset the sessions you probe, although your discoveries will remain recorded, no matter how many times you may need to reset. Only a handful of the puzzles may baffle folks during their first runs of the various probing sessions, and even fewer instances of failure may occur, where the only punishment is being sent back to the safety hub to venture back to where you failed.\n\n\nFor the casual gamer, this is a short journey, more so if you remain calm and/or lack the biofeedback sensor. For the completionists, the repeats for combing the probe sessions will have you searching everywhere. Regardless of your stance to how a game is played, this is one that should be played... you may just learn something about yourself through it.","September 30, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unlike in AtS, though, there are no enemies to hide from, but the overall graphical representation and great sound effects create a pretty spooky atmosphere.  There's really only one area so far with jump scares, so the game relies heavily on the visuals and sound, and it does a nice job.\n\nStory: So far the story tells two stories: Hansel and Gretel, and the original story of a young woman who is coping with the childhood trauma of losing her father.  The original story is fantastic and left me really wishing that they had put the effort into creating another original story rather than the Hansel and Gretel one.  The HaG story is obvious from the moment it starts and really creates no tension or curiosity whatsoever.\n\nValue: Here's main the problem, though. The game currently claims to have 2 levels, but one of them is the Hansel and Gretel tutorial. This wouldn't be a huge problem except that there is only one more level that will be coming for certain. Additional levels after that are dependent upon how well the game sells during early access.  Considering how much time and money (including a rather large and successful Kickstarter campaign and corporate sponsorship) it has taken to get us the 1 and a half levels that we currently have, I just have a hard time imagining that this game will get much bigger.   In it's currrent form, it took me 1 1/2 hours to complete what is available on my first playthrough.\n\nThe bottom line is that the one original story in this game is quite good and makes you want more.  Whether much more will be coming is very much up for debate.","May 9, 2015","true","5.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

But from what I've played so far, I can tell you that this is definitely a fun game.\n\n\n\n---MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS---\n\nNevermind takes you into the subconscious of trama victims.  Where you are then tasked with helping them remember what happened during their inccident. You will find many clues, some of which are red herrings.  The deeper you go into their mind, the creepier and more disturbing it gets.  There are several different patients each with their own tramatic experiences (with more to come soon).  Also, If you are like me and actually have Scopophobia, You are going to have a bad time with the first real patient (the one after the tutorial patient).","July 22, 2015","true","2.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I fist saw it when the devs did their first kickstarter for it, and I've been waiting for their release. I wasn't able to donate to either kickstarter, but now I can still supportthe devs so they can keep working on this game. I can't wait to see what other patients they have in store for us. If biofeedback stuff wasn't so expensive, I would get a sensor just for this game honestly. I'm hoping this will be more than a game for meand help me deal with anxiety issues and learn how to better control my anxiety in situations where it ramps up, which is one of the goals the dev of this game has stated it is.

VFXs, vegetation, shadows, textures, post processing effects...everything looks surprisingly convincing and some of the set pieces look like they have been pulled away from a true triple A game.\nEverything very good so far, but unfortunately i have to talk about the worst thing of the title...\nThe game is very short; way too much according to my point of view.\nYou only have 3 clients to work with, one of which is only a tutorial, and if you have a good intuition you can complete the whole game in about 2 hours...Sure ther's a challenge mode unlocked after completing the game, but it honestly isn't that interesting.\nThe author of the game promised some more content in the future and if at least 2 more clients will be added i will consider this experimental game a true success.\nI'm still glad i played it and i still recommend it, if you like experimental videogames, but if i won't see any new content in about 6 months i'll probably change my review.","January 16","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Fine. But its 2 claims of novelty are just untrue; the story has nothing new or consequential to say about trauma. And the use of a "biofeedback" device (the Mio Link, in my case) is inconsequential.\n\nAfter an intro level with a preposterously generic story, I was thrown into my first "case". After an hour, during which the game failed to alert me that my biofeedback setup was faulty, I had begun monitoring my heart rate simultaneously on my phone. Despite genuinely creepy moments, there was nothing here to goose my pulse. 3 times, the screen DID shimmy and fade as promised, but none of these events were prompted by my heart rate. I replayed them to make sure.\n\nIn 2015, 3D horror-exploration games are a dime-a-dozen. I have personal and professional interest in the content and interface promised by Nevermind. Thank goodness I didn't spend the HUNDREDS of dollars required for the premium biofeedback setups. This game will be forgotten immediately by whatever game earnestly delivers on its promises in the near future.

I beat the game in two short play sessions of about an hour or so each. The game artifically pads its length with "advanced" levels where you just hunt through the same three levels looking for specific objects. I don't count those as levels though. As I stated there's three levels; a tutorial and two full levels. The levels theselves feature stories of real human trauma that unfolds around you in three-dimensions. Now, as a note I did not play with any of the facial recognition webcam stuff or with a heart-rate monitor which is suppsoed to enhance the experience, and I did not play using VR gear like an Oculus Rift or a Vive. Instead I played this game how games are supposed to be played, with just my mouse and keyboard. It didn't scare me that much, a little bit of unsettling imagery here and there. Most of the "Scares" come when you figure a level out and a voice explains what happened that caused their downward spiral.\n\nPROs\n-Very deep intropection on the human condition in the two actual levels, very feels-y\n-Looks pretty, very detailed\n\nCONs\n-You basically need all the peripherals to get the full experience\n-Game too short to sustain interest\n-No replayability\n-Game locked at 30fps, feels very clunky\n\nI would only reccomend this to people with the money to spare for the peripherals and even then its too much investment for not enough gameplay to justify the cost.

I didn't have a Biofeedback sensor so I am unsure how scary the game would have gotten for me as I am not good with horror games. What I do know is that after playing it without a Biofeedback sensor, I can say that the game does build great atmosphere, tension and does a good job of creeping me out, all while showing beautiful innovative visuals that reminded me very much of the twisted visuals of Layers of Fear, and if I am honest, I would rather be playing that. Not that this is a bad game, but Layers of Fear is a scary game, this isn't scary as such, more unsettling. I liked this, I liked the weirdness, the idea behind it. I liked that I was travelling into people's minds trying to resolve their depressive, ptsd disorders. I think this game could be a great tool if the testing on the idea goes ahead and is actually used to help people manage depression and anxiety. I think it's fantastic that they're trying to make something that will help people who suffer with such illnesses.\n\nThe beginning stages of the game are lethargic, text filled, slow, and make me feel like I am playing a walking simulator due to there not being a run button. The controls are terrible! Puzzles require keys to move the cursor rather than the mouse, what a stupid idea!\n\nSPOILER: I completed this in 2.9 hours apparently, but 30 minutes of that was me wandering around aimlessly because I didn't realise I had completed the game. Only 2 full stories to tackle after the tutorial stage. I thought this was terrible. I expected much more longevity from this game and it failed to deliver on that note.\n\nI don't know if they will be adding more cases to this game, I hope so because I would love to play more. My main disappointment with Nevermind is that I paid £7.50 per case (not including the tutorial), and I thought that for the money I would have been given more cases to resolve.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Creepy\n- Atmospheric\n- Surreal\n- Great concept\n- Innovative\n- Interesting puzzles\n- Powerful stories\n- Being studied for health benefits\n- You can use a Biofeedback sensor\n\nCONS:\n\n- What ending?\n- Too short\n- Controls are poor\n- No jump, crawl or run buttons\n- Not everyone has or can afford a Biofeedback sensor just to get the most out of a game.\n\nIf Nevermind had had more cases to solve, I could've overlooked some of it's flaws and given it a higher review score, but due to it's short nature AND the flaws, I can't give Nevermind more than a 6 out of 10. So do I recommend this game or not. Hard to say, the concept is great and I enjoyed playing it, but I felt let down by the end. This isn't a definite purchase by any means, but it has to be a maybe purchase. I think that all depends on the individual. I have done my best to highlight both sides of the coin as to give an impartial review. I hope you found this helpful, but for me, as I liked the atmosphere I would recommend this for people like myself.","October 7, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a really well done psychological horror, and though I have a heart rate monitor, it doesn't have a USB. For shame! Still, my computer was super laggy playing this, even on the lowest setting. Perhaps it's better that I didn't have the monitor on top of it all. The environment designs are super cool and effective. It's like Silent Hill's symbolism meets American McGee's Alice in designs with a dash of Paprika as a storyline.","February 16","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a first-person game with some limited object manipulation in order to solve puzzles, which, though few, are decently thought provoking. Your primary goal is to collect photographs in the patients' memory in order to sort out their memories.\nI would be hesitant to call this a horror game - though there's some unsettling imagery and shocks, it doesn't build a persistent, oppressive atmosphere, nor is there much in the way of threats. It excels in evocative, dreamlike imagery - each patients' mind has a unique theme and recurring motifs that make them feel their own, and oftentimes they are relatively minor details which make the game feel like it had much attention devoted to it. Rounding out the games' strengths are the voice acting, which feel very candid, and the music, which greatly adds to the unique flair of each "case". When background music from a game is stuck in my head days afterward, I consider that an accomplishment on the games' part.\nThe only real weaknesses here are some very basic gameplay - walk and click is mostly what you're limited to - and the slow movement speed of the character (in some areas).\n\nNevermind is a great experience if you're in the market for some surreal imagery and a bit of a tug at the heart strings, and don't mind pretty basic gameplay. If that sounds up your alley, then I don't think you'll be disappointed, as this game's strengths far outweigh its few weaknesses.\n\n**NOTE** - My long playtime is from the game failing to close and running idle for around five hours. There were no technical problems otherwise.","May 22","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
