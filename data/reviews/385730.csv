Haha, I love it!\n- Customization options allow for masterpieces like this one[i.imgur.com]\n- WWE Universe mode perfectly emulates WWE writing team: enjoy feuds and storylines as random and incoherent as tv product.\n\nCons:\n- No trombone mode.\n- Old glitches still persist, can't see Cena at times, RKOs come out of nowhere.\n- No Byron Saxton on commentary. Oh wait, that's not a Pros list. This one's on me. My bad.\n\nIn other news, PC port seems to be somewhat better than 2k15. Except it doesn't launch for some people (upd: I believe these issues have been patched by now). Multiplayer, for the first time in the series history, doesn't lag for me, which is a huge improvement. Customization is improved from 2k15, but still not quite on par with older entries: no custom music, no custom crowd signs for whatever reason.\nLimited number of reversals appears to be an interesting change, adding a bit of a tactical layer to the matches.\n\nThis review gets rewritten into something more useful as soon as Neville gets a push. And by that I absolutely mean replacing all the text with New Day gifs.\nUpdate: now that Neville is injured, I don't even know, this review got sad.\nUpdate: not as sad Wrestlemania 32 booking though.","March 11","true","23.7"," 166 of 184 people (90%) found this review helpful 203 people found this review funny","90","166","184","203","7"

I'm actually able to use strike in this game more than once before it is reversed which is a milestone for me! This is the first WWE video game where I actually have lost a few matches, the previous versions were all way too easy for me even on highest difficulty.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to real matches, They finally nailed the realism and pacing. If you are looking for arcade wrestling or No Mercy (or even HCTP), this may not be it for you, but if you want a realistic wrestling game, this is a must have! Some of my matches have been classic back and forth, mutiple finishers, mutiple close pins, just the overall feeling of at any point the momentum can change, and it will, very true to life wrestling. I've laid the smacketh down on AI at times, only for it to come back and beat me. Again, I enjoy the challenge!\n\nI also enjoy the ability to interrupt entrances or if you are the 2nd person coming to the ring, you can "Break Out" and control your own entrance (including attacking the person in the ring before the bell sounds). VERY COOL and much sought after feature for me. Now if we could only get a feature to attack after the match is over...But overall, I highly recommend 2K16 to anyone who enjoyed the previous installments. This may be the best one yet for me. The Roster size alone gives it a few points!\n\nRestart steam if you are having issues starting, or choose run as admin on the .exe file of the game, ignore the bad reviews about game not running, it runs perfect for me. No issues whatsoever. If there is some sort of issue affecting a lot of computers, then wait for a patch and actually try patience. My framerate, except for entrances (they are locked at 30fps), is a steady 60fps. Only one time did I notice a drop in fps, one time for a second.\n\nAlso, a tip for people complaining about targeting, choose manual in the options menu, you'll thank me later. I suggest looking at options for other "issues" as well. Don't like the chain wrestling? Turn it off. Several options and choices to alter gameplay.","March 10","true","34.1"," 83 of 95 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","83","95","5","11"

Haven't explored it much yet, but it looks good\n- New Day: just because New Day ROCKS.\n- You can beat up Nikki Bella with a sledgehammer.\n- Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens are pretty much spot on (they're the first match I played - Sami's entrance is brilliant)\n\nNegative:\n- No four horsewomen: Yes, another person saying it. The three women in the triple threat at 'Mania, and the NXT women's champion aren't included, and won't be included. Community creations may well cover it - but they shouldn't have to. WWE should be embarrassed about this.\n- Some things are a little outdated. Paige is the NXT women's champion, for example. But I guess, with no Bayley... and Emma isn't Evil Emma.\n- Amore and Cassady are included, but no Carmella. Same applies to Blake and Murphy - no Alexa. Again, a little bit lacking, considering the depth in other areas.\n- I tried to play online, but it couldn't find a match. Whether that's the game's fault, or just that no one's online, I don't know. But I couldn't play against anyone. So I have to give it a negative mark.","March 13","true","109.2"," 72 of 81 people (89%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","89","72","81","13","8"

Although I've played just an hour of game play, I will edit the review when more hours have gone into playing it. First off, I'm pretty impressed with the visuals on some of the superstar models, especially Randy Orton, however I do feel there is some inconsistences amongst the models, some looking like they're from the PS3 (Jericho being a prime example of this) and not next gen. The game is not the best optimized, I have a beast of a laptop running games like Witcher 3, The Division, Rise of the Tomb Raider on ultra, hitting 60 fps with WWE2k16 on maximum I'm hitting on average 50, but patches will more than likely fix this in the future, after all it's not even been out a full 24 hours yet. Started the showcase and it's fun living out my childhood memories of Stone Cold. The roster is ridiculous, the amount of superstars to choose from is huge. The Divas however are lacking. It's pretty sad seeing Layla or Cameron in the game and not a single member of the "4 horsewoman". The creation mod looks good and glad they've put back a lot that was meant to be taken out the previous game. I've only briefly touched on the Universe mode, which I have enjoyed so far. Overall I think this is decent game, with future patches having the possibility of making it a really good game, once fps is smoother. It's worth a buy to any wrestling fan.\n\nEDITED REVIEW\n\nSo after spending more time on the game I feel there are one or two things I should add to my review. I still stand by the showcase being great and is arguably the best feature in this game. Althought the Hall of Fame showcase is not as good as the Stone Cold showcase, it is still good to play classic matches such as Macho Man v my favourite wrestler of all time, Jake "the snake" Roberts. The Universe mode is ok, but I feel it's missing one or two things to make the mode go from ok to great. The Career Mode is enjoyable, it's pretty darn fun using my created superstar in a semi-story mode. The interviews with Renee get repetitive quickly though. There seems to be an odd bug here and there that seems to make the game crash however this has only happened to me once luckly, but I have seen on other reviews/fourms it happens frequently to others.\n\nPros:\nThe showcase mode\nMy Career Mode\nThe insanely large roster (including a decent range of NXT stars to pick from and legends)\nCreation mode is back, bring back things they took out in the previous years\nUniverse mode is enjoyable\nGame looks good and has the presentation of a TV broadcast\n\nCons:\nThe lack of divas (having Layla and Cameron but not any of the 4 horsewoman)\nOptimization (as mentioned hitting 50fps on max with a machine that smashes the recommended requirements)\ninconsistences with character models\nThe odd crash (happened once in my game, but seen it happens frequently in others)\nThe ridiculous lip sync and the fact the mouths are so big when speaking, it looks like you can shove Neptune in there.\n\nOverall 7.5/10","March 10","true","72.8"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","33","41","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NixNightbird/recommended/385730/","NixNightbird","ZeroCorpse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NixNightbird/","35 products in account","While I'm recommending this game based on what's here, I have to also talk about why I WON'T be buying another WWE game from 2K until they make some changes.\n\nFirst off, the game IS a bit buggy at launch and it may run, or it may not. Every single time you click "Play" it's a toss-up whether or not the game will launch. Once it launches, I'm good with 60 fps at Ultra, but whether or not the game starts up at all is the question.\n\nSecond, it absolutely ticks me off that we PC users don't get the ability to use custom music. There's no reason the restrictions of the consoles should remain for the PC version. We don't get stuck with the console graphics, but we do get stuck with the console limits on custom music. This is a DEAL BREAKER for me. I make leagues of my own CAWs, and if I can't give them custom music, that's half of the pro wrestling experience completely thrown out the window. Sure, modders will make it possible, but I shouldn't have to mod the game to get what I want out of it when it comes to something as basic and integral as entrance music.\n\nIt would be NO BIG DEAL for the game to let us point to a folder full of MP3 files, but they're simply not allowing it. That stinks, and it's the big reason why I won't be purchasing 2K17 for PC (or anything else) until I hear that Yukes/2K put the ability to assign custom music to CAWs back into the game. It's ridiculous that I would rather go back and play my league on 2K14 for Xbox 360 because it is technically inferior to 2K16 in terms of customization!\n\nAnother big problem is the submission mini-game. It just sucks, and the AI almost always has the advantage, it seems. It doesn't even make a lot of sense, and I find myself missing the old submission method. Again, 2K14 is making me happy where 2K16 does not.\n\nIf only I could get 2K14 on my PC.\n\nWhat 2K16 does have is great animation, excellent graphics, and a more streamlined (though more limited) creation suite. I'm currently debating if these advances are enough to make me keep this game. Frankly, I'm still pretty ticked about the lack of custom music and I've been two seconds away from hitting the "submit" button on a refund. The only thing keeping me interested is the exceptionally nice look to this game.\n\nBut graphics aren't everything, and while the models all look great, they still don't look photorealistic, and in the end I can probably be happy with my 2K14. So I continue to debate over the value of 2K16 to me.\n\nIf you're a fan of the WWE and all the "superstars" and "divas" in their roster, then you'll probably love this game. Me? I *really* don't care about the WWE characters and would much rather play my own.\n\nWhen some company makes a game like this that doesn't have any licensed characters and instead lets CAW fans make their own leagues, I'll buy two copies (if it's any good). Sadly, I think the thing that ultimately ruins this series for me is the WWE licensing, which seems to be pretty restrictive when it comes to customizing features. That's all I can conclude, anyway, because there is NO TECHNICAL REASON why WWE 2K16 wouldn't support custom music or other customizing features that are missing. So many names were removed from the announcements, so many clothing pieces, so many types of makeup, face paint, etc. and worst of all, on the PC we STILL have to go through the stupid upload process to get logos and faces into the game. WE'RE ON A PC! Why should I need to send something from my PC, to the web site, then get into the game and download it again when it WAS ON MY PC IN THE FIRST PLACE?! This is just so stupid!\n\nWhy can't I get a Fire Pro Wrestling game like this one, yet with all FPW's customization?\n\nI suspect the glitches and bugs will be squashed and eventually the game will start up when you click "Play" instead of tossing a coin and deciding at that time whether or not you'll get to play. I doubt, however, that 2K gives a crap about patching in custom music.\n\nGET IT TOGETHER, 2K.  This is the PC, not a console, and we want CUSTOMIZATION. You won't get another dime out of me until you wake up and support the CAW fans, too.\n\nConsider it a thumbs up if you only want to play within the WWE using their characters or characters that fit the really strict creation content (limited names, no music, limited clothing, limited body sizing, etc), but a big thumbs down if you're a CAW fan. They really disappointed me with this one. I'm getting the refund and going back to 2K14 on my 360.\n\nUPDATE:  Steam denied my refund request because "play time" was past 2 hours. Unfortunately, much of that time was the game "running" in the background (unbeknownst to me) after it had crashed on start-up. This IS a continuing issue with this game. Feel free to check the discussions and other tech support requests. My actual time in game was no doubt under 2 hours. My time trying to load it, trying to troubleshoot it, and dealing with technical issues was over 2 hours.  I do not think 6 hours of troubleshooting and digging into the game to see what's working and what's not working, and what's missing, is "significant playtime".\n\nAnyway, if you're having doubt about the game, get your refund ASAP. Steam doesn't seem to care that the game process continues to run after crashing, or that the game fails to make it clear that they've completely stripped the creation suite, prior to purchase.\n\nI feel like I got ripped off by 2K, here. Enjoy your 45 bucks, guys. I'll seriously reconsider purchasing any 2K title after this.","March 11","false","64.1"," 58 of 88 people (66%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","66","58","88","8","6"

Now I absolutely recommend this game without hesitation! (Original review)[pastebin.com]\n\nLast year we finally got a WWE licensed wrestling game on PC in over a decade, but it was a fairly mediocore game. 2K16 is a huge step up from that - It reintroduces many features that were missing, has a much larger roster and online is greatly improved.\n\nIn fact this is one of my all time favourite pro wrestling games. If you're a fan of the old school Smackdown or N64 games then beware that this is a much more simulation focused game. It's a lot more slow paced and more unforgiving but that allows for more strategic gameplay. With stamina you can't endlessly run away, and you may have to decide to rest a little following a big move rather than hitting another with no stamina left for a quick pin. There's also limited reversals this time and THANK GOD. FINALLY matches aren't just an endless chain of reversals anymore.\n\nIf you dislike any of that then everything can be customised; turn off stamina, reversal slots, adjust finisher damage etc. Also this year's game brings back features like Create An Arena and a much improved Create a Wrestler. (You can create females again! Yay!) The roster is massive and includes past and current wrestlers including some from NXT. Entrances are the best I have ever seen and are now completely seemless which allows you to interfere during your opponent's entrance! Awesome!\n\nIt still suffers from Yearly Franchise Syndrome™ which includes plenty of minor bugs and glitches and some strange roster ommisions like Sasha Banks and Charlotte even though Blake and Murphy are somehow in the game. And for some reason you can't use your own entrance music even though you could do it in the last gen console games. Commentary is also as bland as ever and feels like it hasn't improved since Smackdown Vs Raw 2006.\n\nHowever it is entirely modabble! There was tons of great mods last year from updating wrestler's attire and entrances to entirely new arenas, and this year is no exception. Check out Smacktalks[smacktalks.org] for tons of great mods including tutorials on how to mod the game to use your own custom entrance music.[smacktalks.org]","March 13","true","56.6"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","20","22","4","1"

Runs A LOT better than WWE 2K15, solid 60FPS in game at High settings with 8X MSAA. Gameplay is a little sluggish compared to the previous WWE games, but it helps control the pacing and makes it feel like a true WWE broadcast. Graphics are also improved a lot over 2K15, from the hair not clipping as much, to the sweat effects.\n\nVery big roster, it has a Superstar or Diva for everyone . It has the obvious choices like John Cena, Randy Orton, and Stone Cold Steve Austin, but they even added the more obscure Superstars, Divas, and tag teams like Enzo Amore and Big Cass, Alundra Blayze, and Harlem Heat.\n\n2K Showcase follows Stone Cold Steve Austin, but I haven't touched it very much as I am not interested in the story, but for what it has it's great.\n\nMyCareer is also a major improvement over WWE 2K15. Instead of having you embroiled in meaningless rivalries ("B! Blade! anyone?), you get to pick your path into the WWE and what you want to do with your career. Absolutely amazing, worth the money by itself.\n\nI would say if you have the money OR have not played WWE 2K16 on PS4 or Xbox One, definitely pick this up.","March 10","true","45.5"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","21","26","4","0"

Although that's not as big of a compliment as I made it sound, It's a very mixed bag.\n\nThe customisation options are all back and are utterly outstanding, at the moment the hours of gameplay I've had two matches and spent the rest of it customising and completing the WWE Universe mode to my liking. This is where i have most of my fun, nothing better than being the show runner and having the shows run how i want.\n\nThe wrestling in the matches i have had are still very poor, messy and so, so glitchy. Little mechanic faults and immersion breaking animation trips. Is the character trying to pick another up but he's slightly out of reach? Watch him slide into place as if on ice... Is a wreslter next to an object or even on top of it? Sit back and watch the animation freak out before either giving up or just ignoring you did any button press. It's the 2016 version, how is it still so bad?\n\nThe ropes seem to be a bug bear of the character models who spin around near them like they are electric. Getting in and out of the ring is still limited to the middle section or they freak out at lifes hard choice of weather you meant cclimb the turnbuckle, go to the apron or exit entireley, 2K need to have a little button reallocating. Even lifting an opponent from the floor can take some work as the character model struggles to comprehend what it is you've instucted it to do, often just looking down then stepping back.\n\nEverything in ring feels slower, not in a pacing way just a doddering way to keep the gameplay more 'realistic'. Sure it's realistic if you want to watch the Old age pensioner divison. Running around makes it seem like the players swapped their kneecaps for sponges and they are wearing moon boots. It's one of the ugliest movement animations I've seen in a game aiming for realisim. It's ugly, janky and cheap looking and pretty embarrasing, it's WWE it's already hard to explain to the missus why i still buy the games and still watch it...\n\nI've sweated with anger when the prompts of 'too fast' and 'too slow' pop on screen after reversing, I've sat emulating a Rocky montage trying to train my fingers to hit it right. I;'m convinced there is no real pattern, it's just what ever the game needs it to be at that moment.\nThey've capped the amount of reversals you can do at once, which is a nice feature though i feel they would of been better served actually having to play the game once they release is so they can see just how pants the system is and always has been.\n\nIt's 2016, as I'm reminded by said missus who once again asks why I like this soap opera... Why, why in the day sof 'Realistic action' can't i stop a taunt? Some of these dudes have entire dance routines as taunts which lead to your character helplessly doing the funky shuffle while a large fighter barrels towards you.\n\nIn short the wrestling aspect of this game is it's worst feature, it's poor mechanics hindered by worse colision detection, AI and movement. 2K definately have not figured out how to do this type of action.\n\nSlightly less poo yet still on the scale of "ew what's on my shoe" it's the 'Showcase'. Which is still pretty much the laziest, most uninspired useless game mode. "Hey, remember all those great memories of when WWE was good? Here, play this and remind yourself why you didn't just subscribe tot he Netowrk instead"\nQTE moments which are epicly pointless, the QTE is not so much a 'Quick Time Event' but a 'watch this clip and press the button after a few minutes of an animation playing out' And you can't enjoy the animation of an event being recreated because have to focus on the button wheel at the bottom of the screen to catch the QTE. So what's the point?\n\nI know what they are doing, they want us to go back into our memories of when the product didn't feature Roman Reigns, and by having it fleshed out so poorly it will trick us into thinking we were just remembering it wrong and it did all suck.\n\nHow many objectives per Showcase match do we have to meet? It's like a job i didn't apply for. 7 for the Bret Hart match alone, and some of the descriptions for the objectives are hilariously appauling.\n\nThe roster is the biggest we've seen yet the oddest ommisions are glaring, the womens division gets clearly the worst treatment as the best names get dropped in favour of 2 types of sting and 4 Triple H's. He's definately going over.\n\nCustomisation is amazing, the graphics are good for most of the character models although 2K still can't figure out long hair. However the actual wrestling is disgusting by and large.\n\nHere's a quote for the next poster, slap it right on Goldbergs forehead 'Best bought on sale'","March 12","true","17.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

I've had 0 performance issues, so I'm not sure what all these negative reviews are on about.\n\nEDIT: Alright, now that I've played a decent bit of this game I can expand a bit. The gameplay is a lot better then 2K15 in practically every way. The new submission system is neat, but the real star of the show are the new reversals. The graphics are nice although some player models look like complete ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥. I'm not too deep into MyCareer, but it has been fun so far. Also the creation suite is much more refined in this game. With a lot more options and some nice new features in there too. Overall I'd say it's a really solid game and you should go buy it. Also free dlc is pretty gr8. My only gripe is that as of now the game does not support 21:9 resolution, whilst 2K15 did.\nEDIT 2: So apparently people are having their save files corrupted. I'm not sure how common it is, and this hasn't happened to me, but it wouldn't hurt to backup your game just in case.\n\n8/10","March 10","true","85.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","2"

I loved wrestling games as a kid and I just spent 4 hours making a group of superstars, a couple arenas, nailing their entrances, and getting everything the way I liked it. Somewhere in those 4 hours I realized that I was having a very good time. I decided to give a match a go and it feels similar to the arcade like mashing of games like Just Bring It, but had so much more depth. It took me a match or two to get used to it, but after that that feeling came back. This is a fun game. Not just the next big thing that you feel obligated to play to be included in the hype, but a video game that just feels right. I know this is opinion based, and it could be nostalgia forcing a bias, but I want more games like this on pc. The positive review is my small effort in showing developers that when they do good work, it's appreciated and more importantly, purchased.","March 11","true","25.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I suspect an issue they'll fix, but even so I can understand this causing you to think twice about getting it now.\n-Online improved but still takes time to find matches and can have a lot of lag. For twitch reactions like reversal and fighting games in general where you're paying attention to the frame this can be really rough.\n- One thing about the pinning I would qualify as a negative is they still haven't gotten it to a point where doing things like multiple match ending moves don't end matches and that's partly due to the kick outs not getting harder sooner\n-Commentary is still garbage\n-Misc audio like strikes and throws into barriers still the same archaic sounds from years ago\n-Career and universe mode aren't very different from the past year, they could still use more branching storyline options\n\n\nSome improvements, some is the same crap. The technical issues still make me consider giving it a thumbs down, but I'm enough of a fan and enjoy it enough to push through. If you're not maybe this isn't for you right now.

If you decide to buy 2K15 but not this I will punch you in the face!\n\nAlso, if you are getting stuttering during entrances like I was, I (sort of) found a fix. Go to your documents folder (under C:\Users\[insert name here]\Documents\WWE2K16) and go into the config.ini file. Once in it, change simple_lighting to on and then change audience_tessellation to off. It's not perfect because it will turn (current day) Sting and Luke Harper into black silhouettes during their entrances. However, if you go to into "advanced creation" for Luke and Sting's entrances, change the lighting to whatever lighting you want and it'll make the character models look normal again.

Without a doubt this is a big leap forward on last years edition, graphically it's about the same, but FIFA get away with that every year too :P The real star in this years edition is the large roster and much improved creation tools, and gameplay tweaks to the controls (some such as the submission system are a bit of a faff but in fairness it's better than button mashing to win) , and revesals are vastly improved upon (you can see the shock as you power out on the other players face... hilarious). A lot more expressive animations and better cutscenes and comebacks this time around.\n\nPros - Big Roster full of classic WWE era charcters, All DLCs and unlocks included free, better creation options, smoother gameplay, expanded and improved controls, loading times are massively faster than 2k15 at the price of a bigger 40gb install size, replays are much better now (in last years game they often showed no relivant action), career mode now has more things to do. Entry cutscenes are still poorly optimised and cause terrible frame drop... even though once the match starts it's fantastically smooth.\n\nCons - Still no Diva career mode, Diva roster is improved but still missing many big names like Chyna (Thankfully there are plenty on custom downloadable area), some of the controls are still a bit sluggish and faffy to use (Submissions for example), Custom photo importing is still very poorly supported.\n\nOverall - Must have for Wrestling fans.","March 20","true","65.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The only thing better than a good wrestling match is a good wrestling game, and 2K16 is such.  My biggest gripe is no mixed matches.\n\nI wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I have.  I thought at best, it'd be a fun little game to spend a few hours in.  I've put in more consecutive time here than I have Fallout 4.  At the time of writing this, I am still not burned out on it.\n\nPRO's:\n+Graphics are mostly terrific.  Some Superstars/Divas are spot on.  Others don't seem to have had as much attention to detail put into them (not that they're ugly, just that they aren't as good as the really good ones).\n\n+Create modes. Holy isht, create modes.  Create Superstars, Divas, Entrances, Arenas, Shows, Titles... the CAW was always the draw to these games, and it has been greatly expanded upon here.  Face uploads make for creating anyone you can imagine without much effort, and with logo/texture uploads, you're really only limited by your imagination.\n\n+Sharing these creations is so easy now.  If you've used the Community Creations of The Sims 4, you'll feel right at home here.  Anything you create (even move-sets) can be uploaded and easily downloaded.  WWF CAW vets will appreciate this - no more writing down CAW parts!  Just share that sucker!\n\n+Match types.  Plenty of must-have matches have made a return.  TLC, Elimination Chamber, Hell in a Cell, Steel Cage, Royal Rumble, Last Man Standing, Submission, Battle Royal.  That's not to say they're perfect, which I'll get into in the Con's.\n\n+The Roster.  Largest roster to date in any WWE game, and arguably the best.  It reaches back into WWE history and presents dozens of favorites and familiars.  Some of these even have alternate attires or versions.  Add CAW's to the list, and you're looking at 200+ fighters.  <-Holy Strawberries, Batman, is that a jam!\n\n+Mechanics.  I spent time playing No Mercy and Day of Reckoning waiting for this release, and I wasn't sure how I'd feel about the leap from arcade to simulation.  It's not as bad as people say it is, and I usually hate QTE-type things, but I find them enjoyable here.  It's nice to have control over how you place and evade grapples/holds, and I feel missing the kick out of a pin because of poor timing adds to that "Oh, come on WWE, how could that happen?" feel you get watching the actual program sometimes.  And like No Mercy, the grapple system is multi-layered.  If you've played No Mercy, you know what I'm talking about.  It literally feels like they mashed No Mercy, Day of Reckoning, and Here Comes the Pain into one big, beautiful baby.\n\n+Customization.  This is the best part of the game.  In Universe mode, you can control who's in what show, who they face, and who their rivals are.  It's like a very hands-on Exhibition mode.  Outside of Universe, you can control how the game plays by toning down (or pumping up) the new simulation systems.  You can control what music plays in the main menu.  You can even tweak the individual Superstar/Diva stats, both in Exhibition and in Universe.\n\nCON's:\n-Some matches are not included as team sets.  For instance, I haven't seen any tag team TLC's.  Such a shame, as tag-team TLC was usually among me and mine's favorite match types.  It's a bit odd see it in singles, but not to see the beloved team version.\n\n-Royal Rumble is gender-restricted.  2K16 does not feature a Diva Royal Rumble.  Surely there are enough Divas in the vanilla version to do a 10-woman rumble, but adding CAD's to it, and I see no reason the women couldn't have one.  At least they can do the other matches.\n\n-No mixed matches.  I get it, I understand it, there is nothing that can be said I haven't seen/heard on the issue.  I do not want to be a man hitting a woman.  I want to be a woman hitting a man.  Specifically, Stephanie McMahon.   Beating Brock Lesner.  What's your problem?  The point of WWE video games is to create (or re-create) your dream matches with your favorite WWE characters, and Stephanie McMahon happens to be my favorite.  I can set males to be her enemies, but nothing ever comes of it.  We have Super Mario CAW's fighting Freddy Krueger CAW's.  It's not practical, it's not probable, it certainly isn't representative of WWE, but damn, is it enjoyable.  That's what made the classic games so great - you could have your serious recreations, or you could have totally insane stuff... or, you could be like me, and just want to have your favorite/created Diva be the face of your WWE game.  To ignore mixed matches does very little to protect women... in fact, it makes them appear more fragile.  Not including mixed matches as a possiblity speaks to the WWE's confidence in their current Diva's - both that their personalities are not strong enough to clash with their male counterparts in a digital space, and that their fanbase isn't large enough to want to do so.  Add to the fact that I have to hear Jerry "The King" Lawler spew his sexist comments during a Diva's match ("I may be too old for her, but she certainly isn't too young for me...") as a ring-side announcer, and I roll my eyes at the "respect women" excuse for no mixed matches.  I hate to make this such a political statement when I'm not really seeking equality on a grand scale, just a better game.  Ah, well, hopefully mods will fix this.\n\n-Universe can be redundant.  I'm okay with this, but I list it for those that may be curious.  I figure, Exhibition will be redundant eventually.  At least with Universe, there's a chance of seeing some good random match-ups.\n\n-Lack of notable faces.  No Charlotte Flair, no Dudley Boyz, no Sasha Banks, no Alberto Del Rio (so, no official League of Nations team).  Easily remedied through creation mode, but the over abundance of Triple H's and Undertakers makes you kinda wish these stars were included instead.\n\n-Undertaker from his Fred Durst years is the strongest 'Taker without tweaking him yourself.\n\nAll in all, this is a terrific game, and you can make any Superstar/Diva you want the center of your Universe, albeit with a few warts.  It's been a good minute since I've felt this freedom in a WWE game (pre-SvR and DoR titles), and I've never felt it to the extent I have in 2K16.  Couple this with the gameplay, and I can see myself playing this for years to come... unless 2K17 greatly expands on it (fingers crossed... 2K15->2K16 was a considerable leap).","March 25","true","296.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","5"

I have everything on high settings except the crowd population is at 60% and it runs at 60 fps. If you have a good computer i reccomend you buy this game its alot of fun and a good way to kill time. There are several little flaws with this game but they arent a big deal to me except for two. The first one is the commutity creations. Everytime i try to download a character/arena it wont show up in my game and apparenty everyone is having this issue too, so if they can fix that in a patch that would be great. The second one is the "create a arena" its a fun mode but you cant actually have battles in the arena you built. Which would have been good to know before wasting an hour building my arena (like i said a good way to kill time).

ALWAYS too late or too soon i mean just ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ yo lol. They also make your guy a total ♥♥♥♥♥ at first (which is understandable to build your character from the bottom to the top) however it's very much irritating when you lose a entire match (ANY MATCH) over something so stupid especially when you are being ranked on it. This shows it is not based on your skill of the game but more if you got great timing. It's a pathetic way to go in a game like this in my opinion.. i keep playing and playing because like i said its a fun game, so suspenful and exciting..yet VERY ANNOYING for the reasons i have potrayed. You have to be really quick on responding which adds more realisim but none the less its VERY easy to mistime a reversal or a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing mini game. Do i recomend this? Yeah but watch out if you suck at timing.\n\ni only got 5 hours so far in this specific one , but its no different then the past 2k ones..they still got the mini games.\n\nas far as the reversing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, like i said its based on how well you can predict there moves and the timing before they can sucessfuly use it. I think it sucks but in there defence ...what other system are you gonna do to reverse a move?\n\nYour skills on timing is the outcome of this game.. NO LIE.\n\n♥♥♥♥ this game\n\ni still recommend it.\n\nUPDATE: i assume the devlopers know of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t as they give you the options to boost your character overall to 90 (thats pretty good) and unlock everything by a push of a button at any time. lol","May 13","true","29.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Whenever Christmastime would roll around, my grandma would let me open one gift before Christmas, and it was always my wrestling game.

Character creation, my favorite feature, I used to be able to fill up all the character slots with creations, has simply been flushed down the toilet like a dead goldfish, with no hope of ever coming back or being great again. I've had better load times on the old  Smackdown vs. Raw  series for Playstation 2, this game refuses to let me preview what clothing and hairstyles look like on my superstar because it's too much trouble to render.\n\nI don't want to get into this.

I'm not a wrestling fan, but even I love this game, with its vast customisation, game modes, character roster and sheer amount of replay value is incredible.\n\nRunning at a locked 60 fps, WWE 2K16 sees the return of many favourite game modes, like create-an-arena, create-a-diva, match types, a whole new career mode and much more. The graphics seem better than WWE 2K15, especially with the character models and costume textures. Gameplay wise, I'm loving all the match types and going into the options menu to change rules, game hints, blood on/off and so forth. And speaking of, I also love the new mini-game-like QTEs that happen when actions like a pin, or grapple, occur. It adds a simple layer of 'fun' on-top of what is already a fun, meaty game. I love making my own movesets with my characters, making an entrance for them, and an arena for them to battle in. It's just incredibly fun and you'll be here for triple digit hours with it all!\n\nI haven't tried online, so this is an offline review. Having said that, a couple of things I want to see added in for the inevitable sequel is better audio design. What I mean is - I want to hear the occasional character scream or grunt as they pull off certain moves; giving it immersion by proportioning realism onto what is already a realistic game. Also minor, yet near-essential things like hearing footstep noises, climbing the ladder/cages, more variety in 'punch' sounds beyond the generic slap noise. And finally, better flowing commentary: it's quite jarring hearing the commentary suddenly cut-out to talk about something else I'm doing without finishing the previous sentence.\n\nOverall, as I said, I'm not a wrestling fan at all and I doubt this game will turn me to one, but I'm very much enjoying my time with this game. Perhaps a little more violence wouldn't hurt with enhanced persistent character damage, floors being scuffed and whatnot as per real wrestling. Having said that, this is a much better, improved, real letter to the fans that were left disappointed by the previous iteration or like me, just lost interest after so many features were dropped.\n\nRecommend to people who enjoy sports, brawlers, RPGs, simulators and action.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LotusAing/recommended/385730/","LotusAing","LotusAing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LotusAing/","386 products in account","VS CONSOLE\nI've played this game previously on the Xbox One. According to the Xbox, I have played at least 264 hours on it.\nSo how does the PC version stand up to the console version? I think it holds up very well. The game does have a few crashing problems for me, but so did the console version. The PC version also loads up 10x quicker than console. It would literally take a minute or more to load into a match on the console. For PC, it takes about 10 seconds.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nIf you're looking for an arcade like wrestling game, I'd suggest looking for a different title. But for someone looking to play a wrestling simulation just like the TV show, you will love this game.\n\nThe pacing in matches is fairly slow to start off as you perform lock ups. You then transition into your normal grapples, leading into back and forth action. You have limited reversal, so you have to use your reversals wisely. As you get into the big heavy hitting moves, you start to feel the exhaustion as your wrestler fights with every last strength they have. Every time you kick out from a person's finisher, you feel like you're out of breath as you and your opponent can't believe you still have fight left in you. Believe me when I say, you will feel extremely satisfied when you kick out of a finisher without using your resiliency. And honestly, it's hard to get upset after losing a match when you know you put up one h*ll of a show.\n\nCREATIONS\nFor creations mode, you have a decent variety of things to create. You can create your own Wrestler (Cool looking or just plain wacky), you can create your own title belt, your own arena, your own show, and unlike 2K15, you can create your own Woman Wrestler (or Diva, as WWE likes to call them...). The customization for your wrestlers are very good. I have been able to create some very life like wrestlers, especially with the face import tool (where you can import any face you want and use them for your created wrestler). Create a move-set is still there of course. Create an entrance is better this year, with nearly every wrestler's entrance as an option, as opposed to very little. Unfortunately, still no custom themes (but there are mods for that...)\n\nMYCAREER\nHonestly, I played this on the console version and was VERY bored with it. Very rarely have I ever gotten cutscenes and storylines. Aside from the mandatory feud with Tyler Breeze in the beginning. I don't quite have much to say for this mode since I kind of skipped out on it. I'm currently trying to go through it again for PC. So, hopefully I can give you updates on my thoughts for it.\n\nUNIVERSE MODE\nSame sh*t as the previous years, nothing has changed, lol. You run your shows, create feuds. Get occasional cutscenes.","March 24","true","100.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And finally, better flowing commentary: it's quite jarring hearing the commentary suddenly cut-out to talk about something else I'm doing without finishing the previous sentence.\n\nOverall, as I said, I'm not a wrestling fan at all and I doubt this game will turn me to one, but I'm very much enjoying my time with this game. Perhaps a little more violence wouldn't hurt with enhanced persistent character damage, floors being scuffed and whatnot as per real wrestling. Having said that, this is a much better, improved, real letter to the fans that were left disappointed by the previous iteration or like me, just lost interest after so many features were dropped.\n\nRecommend to people who enjoy sports, brawlers, RPGs, simulators and action. Worth the £35 asking price? Definitely!","March 13","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LotusAing/recommended/385730/","LotusAing","LotusAing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LotusAing/","386 products in account","VS CONSOLE\nI've played this game previously on the Xbox One. According to the Xbox, I have played at least 264 hours on it.\nSo how does the PC version stand up to the console version? I think it holds up very well. The game does have a few crashing problems for me, but so did the console version. The PC version also loads up 10x quicker than console. It would literally take a minute or more to load into a match on the console. For PC, it takes about 10 seconds.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nIf you're looking for an arcade like wrestling game, I'd suggest looking for a different title. But for someone looking to play a wrestling simulation just like the TV show, you will love this game.\n\nThe pacing in matches is fairly slow to start off as you perform lock ups. You then transition into your normal grapples, leading into back and forth action. You have limited reversal, so you have to use your reversals wisely. As you get into the big heavy hitting moves, you start to feel the exhaustion as your wrestler fights with every last strength they have. Every time you kick out from a person's finisher, you feel like you're out of breath as you and your opponent can't believe you still have fight left in you. Believe me when I say, you will feel extremely satisfied when you kick out of a finisher without using your resiliency. And honestly, it's hard to get upset after losing a match when you know you put up one h*ll of a show.\n\nCREATIONS\nFor creations mode, you have a decent variety of things to create. You can create your own Wrestler (Cool looking or just plain wacky), you can create your own title belt, your own arena, your own show, and unlike 2K15, you can create your own Woman Wrestler (or Diva, as WWE likes to call them...). The customization for your wrestlers are very good. I have been able to create some very life like wrestlers, especially with the face import tool (where you can import any face you want and use them for your created wrestler). Create a move-set is still there of course. Create an entrance is better this year, with nearly every wrestler's entrance as an option, as opposed to very little. Unfortunately, still no custom themes (but there are mods for that...)\n\nMYCAREER\nHonestly, I played this on the console version and was VERY bored with it. Very rarely have I ever gotten cutscenes and storylines. Aside from the mandatory feud with Tyler Breeze in the beginning. I don't quite have much to say for this mode since I kind of skipped out on it. I'm currently trying to go through it again for PC. So, hopefully I can give you updates on my thoughts for it.\n\nUNIVERSE MODE\nSame sh*t as the previous years, nothing has changed, lol. You run your shows, create feuds. Get occasional cutscenes.","March 24","true","100.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For the first time there is a real tension and back and forth feel to online play just like the kind of tense moments you get in a Wrestle Mania main event in WWE PPV.\n\nI am going to give the game a recommendation and thumbs up because of the above thoughts about this game however there is a big con for me with the online experience.\n\n1 on 1 normals matchs is the only match type you're able to play online in this game unless you have a heap of friends with the game who want to play with you. I enjoy the normal matches very much but it should be so much better than this. As with all large corperate game companies nowdays, you make a great game but you have no clue how to make a compelling online exerience or more likely just do not care. The system for match making is one of the worst matchmaking systems in history.  Multiplayer has been carelessly tacked on at the end and to hell with your playerbase that enjoys online competition. I don't even see leaderboards this year which makes it a downgrade from 2k15 in that aspect.  I want to be able to get into a 1 on 1 Hell in a cell match at the very least and I want to be able to at least comunicate GG at the end of a great match without having to say it through a always turned on mic. Is that too much to ask from a modern wrestling game? I think not.\n\nEasy Fix imo - Remove all the unnessassry match options from the selection screen, which are false advertising since no one can find a match in any of them. Implement 4 options instead which will be 2 players - 4 players - 6 players.\n\nAll the players get put into the same lobby and pick one of these three options. Once the players are all in we enter a vote for which match type it will me and bang .. done. We dont bother with caws online, we only care about fast effiecient matchmaking.\n\nYou done ****ed it up","March 17","true","150.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't get me wrong it's decent, but way too many QTE's, and some objectives are very hard causing frustration, and that's on the normal setting. Not to mention didn't we just have something similar a few years back with WWE 2K13? It's time to add some new flavor don't you think? Plus due to licensing issues some stuff is cut such as the enforcer at WM 14 is known only as the "Enforcer", and not Mike Tyson, and the model dosn't even look like him. Add to that there is no DX music when Shawn Michaels comes out during the same match.\n\nAdding your face to create a wrestler is a bit tricky.\n\nThe soundtrack, whle improved still is pretty bad.\n\nSome of the graphics, yes I placed the graphics as a pro, bu they are also a con because while overall they have improved, some models look nothing like the real wrestlers, or look like puffed up marshmellow men.\n\nAll things considered it's still a rather enjoyable, and fun game.

I enjoy making non-human characters and highly unlikely creatures that happen to wrestle. The good things I can say is the logo uploader, but somehow they make it really complicated to do. Entrance is the best so far, but it still needs more and use the PC to its advantage like custom videos, music and images.\n\nHow's Online?\nLaggy, even worse when playing with more than 2 people.\n\nHow's the roster?\nThe biggest roster in a wwe game to date, but is still missing some great ones. I can name a few of my personal faves that are gone, but the majority of everyone's faves are in it regardless.\n\nHow's the fighting?\nIt's good if you want a sort of realistic wrestling gameplay, but playing isn't as fun as I had in 2K14. Everything feels to advanced such as the stats, skills, etc. I much prefer the basics and general options when making a character. The reversal meter is the best addition though.\n\nVerdict?\nIf you want an online wrestling game to play, don't get it.\nIf you want to make wacky characters, you can but very limited.\nIf you want a singleplayer experience, absolutely get it.","June 2","true","30.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Lack of music for entrances and overall entrance motions, almost every hat is entrance only, and there is just a lack of good clothing options so I hope you like using the logo upload manager.\n\nIn terms of the port it's acceptable.

Then it continuously froze only on the Universe Mode screen. So I thought I'd re-purchase it on PC instead to do some modding for it, but despite having better than the recommended settings for this game, it still runs quite poorly. Even while not in full screen and the audience density or texture turned down, the game consitently provides a B performance rating. I get lag spikes throughout matches, but the worst part for lag is during the entrances. No matter how low I turn the graphics or how small the window is, the superstar entrances are slow and laggy, especially when stuff like pyro is used. This pretty much ruins the main thing I'm modding in the game.\n\nI'm just hoping I don't get the data corruption that most people (modders in particular) seem to be getting with this.\n\nI'll continue playing, but I'm not happy with this.","May 14","false","10.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","3"

I even own' the PS4 version and it's no better than the PC port only reason I bought this was just mod it and pla}|\n?y as the NPCs that should have been playable to begin with.\nThe reversal system is just garbage sometimes it will say you reversed it when you didn't or it will not when you did reverse. Trying to irish whip someone back into the ring feels like a choir because most times it will always wanna aim at an angle and just smack them againts the apron.\n2k Showcase mode is mostly reused content from WWE'13 and Legends of wrestlemania matches for stone cold so not and the My career mode just no fun at all.....\nLets talk about how garbage the AI is... I'm getting pinned in a tag team match after a finish and hal the time the AI just sits there and doesn't do anything to help costing the match so it's basically a 2 on 1. With how crappy the reversal system is you will be missing all the time while AI is constantly reversing nothing wrong with a challenge but when it completely favors the AI on normal difficulty then you've messed up....\nWhat's with all the removed stuff from CAW mode hardly anything to work with anymore can't even make a backwards hat anymore everything is so limited you be better of playing WWF WARZONE on psx.\nI haven't fully enjoyed a WWE game since Smackdown vs RAW 2007.....\nDon't buy this if you're expecting a playable game only buy it for the mods nothing else there is nothing redeemable about this game besides the mods","April 14","false","41.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The gameplay is the same old garbage, the newly added chain wrestling and resting holds don't really make the gameplay any better. Some animations look horrendously robotic, and there are a bunch of glitches. But, by far, the worst part about the gameplay is the submission mini-game which just makes me wonder how can someone in their right mind decide that this mini-game was a good idea, it's almost impossible to make the AI submit (I'm using a controller, it could be easier with a keyboard, i'm not sure). As far as the creation suite goes, it's fairly decent, but if you're looking to jget all your stuff from the community creations, you'll be very disappointed with how dead the CC is on the PC, so you're better off getting the PS4 or Xbox One version. As for the showcase mode and the career mode, I only played the first two matches of showcase mode, and it was pretty ♥♥♥♥, the voice acting was ♥♥♥♥, and major parts of the Bret Hart vs Stone Cold storyline weren't even explained, for example: the game doesn't even explain why Ken Shamrock was the special guest referee at their Wrestlemania 13 match. Career mode is also garbage from what I've seen.\n\nTo sum it all up: I wish I could get this game refunded, but it's too late for that now, rip 50 dollars.

In many ways, it seems like an experiment not well tested then, on top of that, it seems to have disabled the AI from making each other tap out. Which, for those like me who like watching AI vs. AI matches in universe, means you will be watching long fights, with multiple finishers. Many of which could, and should of, ended with a submission, but for some reason the hold is let go and the AI decides to pin soon after.\n\nAll in all, while I remain happy 2K is realeasing a PC version of this with all the DLC, after a decent first iteration and mediocre 2nd, something outstanding has to be part of the 2K17 package for me to buy this game 3 years in a row.","March 14","false","116.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I don't play the other modes:\n\n1) A lot more customization than last year.\n2) The submission system somehow got worse than last year.\n3) Easy mode is fighting ragdolls who forgot they have arms.\n4) Normal mode is highly over-turned as far as reversals go.\n5) The mini-pin game works well, if you are the PC.\n6) The same constant interview with the creepy lady over and over and over.\n7) The Authority seems like piece mail, and thier directives only make sense about 15% of the time whether you roll with them or against them.\n8) The lack of interesting matches you get to participate in.\n9) The same constant run in to start rivalries over and over.\n\nOverall, it's way better than last year, but that doesn't say a great deal. The developers are simply very lazy and anything resembling stories is non-existent. However, WWE 2K16 would be impressive if PS3 was still on top of the market.  I've bought this the last two years hoping for a decent my career mod as I grew up watching wrestling that doesn't exist anymore: Mid-South, NWA on TBS, AWA, etc.  While 2K16 is better, it's like claiming that eating a mud sandwich tastes better than dirt. Yeah, it's a little more complex, but it's still malnourising.\n\nIn short, I'd hold off on buying this one because of the WWE Universe save corrupt issue and MyCareer is a repetitive, grindfest with the same runs-ins and interview, not interviews, over and over.","April 29","false","50.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The career mode has taken a leap from 2k15, However, it still needs a lot of work. The career mode is repetitive and the game just loses its track. Events happen once in a blue moon, you cannot even start a career match without someone running in your match, the rivalry that follows that is very repetitive. The roster is a huge YES!

This was my first pre purchase ever and I'm glad I went for it. It's so rare at this age of time  to be able to play a game smoothly at launch for PC...\n\nHonestly 2K15 seemed like a demo to 2K16. 2K16 is the real deal.

Gameplay is more of less similar with a few meaningful tweaks like limiting reversals, button spamming when performing a hold. All these tweaks have improved the gaming experience. I did face FPS drop to 10-15 about 2-3 times during my 5+ hours of gameplay. But considering it's just released. I can expect it to fixed in a future fix. You also get all DLCs since day one, unlike 2K15 where they were released as an update after some time.","March 11","true","115.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not amazing. I'm not really sure it's worth the 50 bucks even with all the DLC that puts it over 100 on other platforms, but it's fun if you want a good laugh. The controls are awkward and the collision handling is pretty terrible. If you want to climb the turn buckle, it's the same button to do so as it is to tag your partner in a tag-team match, so sometimes if you want to tag out, you'll climb the ropes instead. And speaking of climbing the ropes... in a battle royal? Wanna jump off the top rope onto somebody, but there's somebody pinning somebody else, no worries, it'll just slide them across the ring and out of your way as you hit them on your way down. Yup.\n\nFurther issues include the targeting/locking system or whatever. Multiple people in the ring? Wanna switch targets? Well, by default, 'smart' targeting is on, which is hilarious as it basically means you can't switch targets. So you decide to turn it on manual switching... awesome, do it mid match, that's cool. Next match, however, it's back to default. So you change it outside battle, that's a pretty obvious fix, right? Only if you actually think that the targeting switching actually works. Guess what, half the time it doesn't. Woo!\n\nThen there's the graphics, oh man, they're interesting. It's very very obvious which "superstars" (still cracks me the hell up that WWE insists that all it's wrestlers, oh wait, can't call them that, are superstars), they spent the most time on.

I have bought over 100 games through Steam, and this is by the far the worst.   I paid 50 dollars for glorified PC port.   And most PC ports are all trash.   First, there isnt any mouse support.   You have you hit space, return, esc to navigate the menus.   Second, the controls while wrestling are stupidly nonsensical.   Almost to the point of being absurd.    Games like Elite Dangerous ( a space sim) use a ton of controls.  Were every keystroke helps you pilot your ship.    But there is absolutely no reason to have a wrestling game need all the keys to control your character.   Its almost like they took the all the different combinations of movements & controls possible from a game controller and then mapped them to indivual keys.   That is ridiculously stupid.   3rd, there is no tutorial to help you learn the game.  Nothing, no instructions, no warm up matches - nothing.   You get dropped into it, and you have to figure it out.   4th, there are 2 "mini games" - and they are not fun.   1 mini game for submissions, and 1 mini game for kicking out of a pin.   But, there is no way to practice or learn either of these, until you are in a match.   And you will quickly lose the match, if you can't figure out the mini game fast enough.   Kind of important to have a tutorial on these things.  Last but not least, this simply isn't fun.   With a terrible control system 2k games took a potentially fun game and made a frustratingly bad game.\n\n\nAlmost forgot.   I had a friend come over and try the game.   The guy is a wrestling fan, and played a bunch of the console games.   He played all the older n64 wce and wwf games back in the day.   I let him play this game, and tried to talk him through how to play it, and he was completely shocked and how bad the control system was.   If nothing else, he saved 50 dollars.\n\nIts games like this that explain Steam's game return policy.   But I want to take it a step further.   I want to be able to blacklist 2k Games from my Steam store.   I literally never want to see another game made by 2k games every again.   I never want to potentially buy another game from this developer.\n\nSteam, can you make that happen?","April 11","false","23.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nice customer service.  I tried a full uninstall and re install.  Universe still isnt saving.   I dont know if they will patch this or if I am just out $50 bucks.  I also tweeted WWE stating to have YUKE and 2k fix this issue.  It doesnt appear to happen to everyone and Im sure it is something minor but i have literally tried over 10 different things on the forums and nothing has worked.  Do not get this on PC in my opinion.  I am hoping a patch comes out to fix it and if it does I will definatley update my review.

It's not amazing. I'm not really sure it's worth the 50 bucks even with all the DLC that puts it over 100 on other platforms, but it's fun if you want a good laugh. The controls are awkward and the collision handling is pretty terrible. If you want to climb the turn buckle, it's the same button to do so as it is to tag your partner in a tag-team match, so sometimes if you want to tag out, you'll climb the ropes instead. And speaking of climbing the ropes... in a battle royal? Wanna jump off the top rope onto somebody, but there's somebody pinning somebody else, no worries, it'll just slide them across the ring and out of your way as you hit them on your way down. Yup.\n\nFurther issues include the targeting/locking system or whatever. Multiple people in the ring? Wanna switch targets? Well, by default, 'smart' targeting is on, which is hilarious as it basically means you can't switch targets. So you decide to turn it on manual switching... awesome, do it mid match, that's cool. Next match, however, it's back to default. So you change it outside battle, that's a pretty obvious fix, right? Only if you actually think that the targeting switching actually works. Guess what, half the time it doesn't. Woo!\n\nThen there's the graphics, oh man, they're interesting. It's very very obvious which "superstars" (still cracks me the hell up that WWE insists that all it's wrestlers, oh wait, can't call them that, are superstars), they spent the most time on. Most of the models for the incredibly lacking NXT roster are outright garbage. On top of that, any mid-carder, jobber, or female wrestler also look like they were made in a weekend. And that's not even mentioning what they did to poor Rene Young and her teeth. Good god almighty, she should sue.\n\nHowever, this is the biggest budget WWE game of all time supposedly, which isn't really a surprise, it just points to the fact that 2K games and the WWE don't take their fans or customers very seriously, and that the annual release schedule is untenable and leaves everybody with an unfinished/unpolished product.

Well 2K15 was garbage so I will compare this game to the last decent one, WWE 2K14.\n\n-No Custom Music\n\n-Logo system is overly complicated and public, from using a logo sizing code on a website to downloading your own images from their community creations in order to use them yourself.\n\n-Cannot setup your own title matches in universe mode.\n\n-Many people reporting crashes, especially during entrances.\n\n-Many people reporting low fps, just read through the discussions page.\n\n-SOOOOOOO many items and parts are missing from the Create-a-Wrestler, I'm talking TONS!\n\n-New disfiguration system, what I call their morphing system, has dropped the sliders and is now using a complicated image interface where you move points of the facial image to morph the face. I'm having a hard time just explaining whatever this new limited system is! Oh yeah and you have to edit the front THEN the side of the face, this includes, for example, editing the mouth under two subsections instead of one, making it far less convenient.\n\n-It takes FOREVER to launch / load, and some are even unable to get the game to load at all.\n\n-The new submission system is just weird, I haven't fully grasped it yet so I won't comment about it too much.\n\nNow to be fair, here is a few things I like about the game;\n\n-Giant roster size and they actually have more divas this time. Divas tend to get sidelined, a major failing in 2K14 imo.\n\n-Can create 100 wrestlers (that all look the same because of limited CAW, i know i know, it just bugs me!)\n\n-Much better graphics (but poor optimization for some)\n\n-Of the clothing parts they actually DO have, there is more volume and detail to them making them look more real.\n\n-You can choose a matieral such as metallic, satin, cotton, ect to give your outfits different sheens.\n\nOverall I do not recommend this game because I myself am regretting buying it. If anything, follow it and wait for 2K to address the problems many are having or just wait until it goes on sale / down in price. Its a mainstream game for a mainstream audience that cares more about graphic quality rather than content quality, action over story, stock play over customization, money over innovation. So your typical modern day corporate charged grab bag full of hot air in order to make it look full.

I'm "too early" to dodge that chair about to cripple my legs? WHAT?!\n- Can't even create your own storyline like in 2k12. I don't care if its text only, why can't you let me have my own fun? Oh right. This is WWE 2k16\n- Compared to Here comes the pain and Raw vs Smackdown 2006-2009's storyline with allusions to the attitude era, the story is just so crap. I don't feel like I make an impact in the company like in the old games. Counter argument is "B-but muh-r-realisms for being a wrestler!" If I wanted to know what it's like to be rejected and constantly deal with John Cena being the poster boy and not me I would try to run for the real WWE and not play a video game.\n\nOther than that, this is the only PC Wrestling game I can play cause the other ones aren't supported anymore when it comes to online communities. I can have a bit of fun here and there since the game at least has Steve Austin and community created wrestlers (which can corrupt your save).\n\nIf you haven't played any recent WWE games that are worse than this since you come from the old PS2 ones and stopped watching wrestling ever since, you won't recognize most of the roster and will realize how bad WWE is now. I can still have some fun because of custom creations and the WWE Legends to remind me of the old days.\n\nThere's still more for me to unlock, hopefully unlocking everything will make the game better. I'll update the review then. Behind all of the complaints, there's a fun game waiting to be played. The combat mechanics aren't honestly all that bad but the quicktime events just kills it for me especially when "Press button within split second or lose the match" is what summarizes every match.\n\n*Update 28/05/2016*\n- Game won't even start now, crashes on startup.

Since the game only adds very few things in it and still follows that stupid conga line of WWE 2k15 for having no Custom Music, that's when I came with a conclusion:"This game is a copy of the Xbone/PS4 port with the developer having zero self-awareness and drinking ♥♥♥♥ mixed with horse ♥♥♥♥ and monkey fart!" "But Chara!" You might shout, "The gameplay is awesome, man.....and that is what it all matters!" But, do you guys know that the gameplay is actually just copyed from the good ol' SvR games with some very little changes?

I bought it from an impulse buy since it was 50% OFF but even that isnt worth it. I play WWE 13 more then this game that game came out 2 years ago.

I am still playing it though, because all I do in this game is create characters, play Royal Rumbles with said creations and I have fun simulating my WWE Universe too.\n\nAnyway, let's break it down in Pros and Cons so it's easier to get my points straight.\n\nPROS  Amazing Graphics;\n\nThe roster is pretty packed with a bunch of DIFFERENT wrestlers. What I mean is - there's not many variations of the exact same character like in the previous versions. Just Steve Austin, but he's awesome so SWIG O' WATER FOR THE WORKING MAN.\n\nMyCareer isn't a joke now. Oh wait, it still is because there's a great chance to CORRUPT YOUR DATA! I'm going to talk more about this in the CONS section;\n\nYou can create your own show, your own arena, championship and of course, many characters and WOMEN (suck it, 2k15) with their own move-sets and entrances;\n\nThe move-set list is excellent!\n\nIt takes a while to get the hang of the game, but after some practice you're gonna tear the house apart with a large variety of movements, like Springboard attacks and OMG moments;\n\nEvery DLC is available right from the bat, like it says on the thumbnail. I've seen some people asking, so I thought I should add this piece of information in this review as well just in case;\n\nYou can remove the Chain Wrestling stuff by going into the Options menu and setting both Chain Wrestling bars to the lowest of the low;\n\nThe AI can be challenging if you raise the difficulty bar up enough;\n\nI may be biased because Steve Austin is my favorite wrestler, but the 2k Showcase is awesome. 2k Showcase can also corrupt your file too, by the way.\nCONS  Although the Create-a-Wrestler Mode is very well done, there's not many options to choose from designs, tattoos, body shapes and a couple other things that really bothers me, because in the older games we had hundreds of designs to choose from and in this one we have twenty or so.\n\nYeah, you can download custom logos and upload some of your own, but in my opinion it should have more vanilla designs for us to choose.\n\nAlso, if you use too many designs in your creation, your character gets 'infected' with some weird green particules all over his body, and you can fix that by changing his skin colour just a little bit and saving right after you change it;\n\nImporting faces can be kinda buggy too, and also weird as heck;\n\nEditing faces is weird, but that is just me. I prefer the old way with all the sliders. I have a problem making asian characters as well, but that is just me again I think, lol;\n\nThe submission system can be very, very random with a controller. I had no problems playing with a keyboard, but with a controller I feel it's just luck based. Just wear down your opponent and keep doing a submission move until you get it right;\n\nLilian Garcia can sometimes glitch up her lines and say something like - AND THE CHALLENGER, THE MONEY IN THE BANK LADDER MATCH AND THE WWE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION, FROM DAVENPORT, IOWA. It kinda ruins the immersion, but it is funny when it happens;\n\nBe careful when downloading stuff from the Community Creations, because sometimes the game can simply NOT SAVE and corrupt your data;\nAnd the main reasons I cannot recommend the game right now is:\nFPS problems. I have a kinda outdated graphic card (Radeon R7 200 Series) but this graphic card runs any other recent game well in medium settings. However, I tried to play a 30-man Royal Rumble match with medium settings, and after a while the game started to lag a lot. I had to close the match because there was no way I could keep playing in slow motion. Some people do not have this problem with lesser graphic cards, but I and many others do, especially AMD users;\n\nThe game still crashes a bit during entrances like Bray Wyatt's or Undertaker's and during at any point in MyCareer mode. This latest patch fixed a couple random crashes during entrances, but it still happens from time to time.\nAlso, songs do not suddenly stop playing after playing the game for a while anymore;\n\nSometimes the game decides to corrupt your data. So please, I cannot stress this enough BACKUP YOUR SAVE GAME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!\n\nBEFORE ANYTHING BAD HAPPENS, go to Steam\userdata\[YourID] and copy the whole 385730 folder, and I mean the WHOLE FOLDER, not just the remote stuff. After you do that, paste that save in a safe place, like your porn folder.\n\nNow if you get your files corrupted by just playing MyCareer like I did, at least you have your progress saved.\n\nIf that ever happens, don't panic - Shut Steam down and go to the Steam folder. Delete the ENTIRE CORRUPTED 385730 SAVE FILE inside the Steam\userdata\[YourID]\ folder and paste the one you had saved before. Now, double-click the save you just pasted and DELETE the remotecache.vdf, so Steam Cloud doesn't eff up your save. Start Steam and start your game. Steam is going to ask you what file you want to use - choose the LOCAL FILE option.\n\nYou SHOULD be good to go with this method, but sometimes Steam just doesn't upload your entire save to the Cloud. If that happens, turn off Steam Cloud.\n\nIt sucks, we shouldn't care about this, but this is such a messy port that if you want to buy this crap and have fun with it, it's a sacrifice you have to make;\n\nAlso, JBL sucks. The commentary is golden because JBL is just 'there', and the majority of the dialogue is between Cole and Jerry. Sometimes JBL says something like OH THERE'S THE FINISHER and that's pretty much it.\nBesides the obvious Cons, I can safely say that this game is great IF YOU DON'T MIND BEING EXTRA CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGRESS. However, my love for wrestling, my patience and my graphic card doesn't overcome FPS issues. I'll keep myself from playing MyCareer, 2k Showcase and a 6-man Hell in a Cell  - or any sort of a 6-man kind of match, even though is my favorite match type to play. Royal Rumble is fine now for me, but it still lags a bit.\n\nIf you have a low-end PC or an AMD graphic card - you should avoid this game for now, or at least until/if 2k releases another patch or something regarding us AMD users.\n\nTL;DR - It is a fun wrestling game, lots of stuff to do but 75% of the game can corrupt your save at any given point, and it lags quite a bit for AMD users.\nAlso, we need a doctor out here for precaution, because with damaged ribs like that it can be hard to breathe.","March 10","false","190.5"," 16 of 36 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","16","36","0","0"

Another sluggish port.  Still find characters waiting for animations to trigger.  If you find a bundle with all the DLC then you'll have a decent roster.  If you are inclined to play the Hall of Fame mode to play actual scripted matches to unlock more characters then you'll have an even better roster.  Still not fun to play though.

Sadly though as soon as i try do anything other then a 1vs1 the game goes into super slow motion and is basically unplayable.\n\nNow this could be due to my graphics card being a bit shoddy but i cant give a positive review to a game that wont work for me.\n\nThe game also takes a long time to load past the splash screen.\n\nPros:\n+Brilliant Reversal system that makes the match an actual fight and not just a reverse fetish.\n+Good Graphics ''for a WWE game''.\n+Way better reverse animations, and just animations in general.\n+Fluid gameplay (sometimes a bit slow).\n+Ability to use manual targeting systems and also being able to turn off certain features you dont like, like chain grappling and other stuff.\n+Career mode has been revamp and is actually good.\n\nCons:\n-Changing graphic settings from the highest to the lowest will change your FPS for 30-34 ect.\n-Some animations take a while and everything goes completly silent whilst ur doing it.","March 14","false","4.8"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

It has some AWESOME game design marred by shitawful implementation that makes the experience on the whole very unenjoyable.\n\nThe pros:\n- The graphics look quite frankly amazing even on lower settings.\n- The roster is humongous.\n- The customization options were largely improved over WWE2k15, including the inclusion of custom divas.\n- Career mode is fun, but...\n\nThe cons:\n- The lnput lags. And i don't mean a bit. I mean that a game where your winning or losing a match (escaping a pin) is based on a timing minigame, has a solid half second of input delay. That is unplayable. You can still win if you get used to it, but it's terrible for a company like 2K to not even be able to code a decent input manager.\n\n- Reversals are ♥♥♥♥ing impossible. Let's be real here: nobody knows ALL the moves to this game. There's just too many. Even if they did, they'd not be able to spot which is being done in time for the reversal window to matter. Hence why the input delay, coupled with the fact that sometimes the reversal prompts just refuse to show, or show too early/late, is again a huge problem that needs addressing ASAP. Considering i've read various sources saying it's been there since 2014, i'd not hold my breath for a fix.\n\n- The AI cheats. If you have limited reversals enabled (Don't) the AI will ignore that if you're gaining too much on it. It also kicks out after the second or third finisher in a match. And we're not talking Undertaker versus Sting on PPV here, we're talking jobbers on a normal show night.\n\n- Lip synching in the very few dubbed scenes is comedically bad, but nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ about that.\n\nIn summation: The game designers for this game put a lot of effort into building a simulator. The fact that the match is graded on its entertainment value is an awesome idea that makes losing feel like less of a failure, if you at least managed to get a good rating out of the match, the strategic choices when building a moveset and stats combination are as deep as it gets, then whoever programmed the whole thing took a giant steaming ♥♥♥♥ all over the very obvious effort and ruined it with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI and Input.\n\nGood job 2K.","March 13","false","14.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

If anything, it's now worse since you can't seperate it brands.\nThey still didn't fix the bug where if you change the participants in MITB and Royal Rumble, then winner loses his privellage. And of all that, they still didn't add custom music for PC. Really? It's really not a hard feature to add. The lack of features in Universe Mode makes the whole large roster more pointless.\n\nAnd why is it that I get numerous CTD's when I go through some superstar's entrances in MyCareer Mode?\n\nAnd the Submission system of course.  It's hard to control, and hard to get used to. Luckily, defensive side of submission isn't so bad, but the offense?

Even though i was looking forward to WWE 2k16 on PC.\n\nLet me dive deeper into my decision though:\nI still own a PS3, so i can't have the shiny Next-Gen Versions of the WWE games nowadays. Then 2K decided: "Hey, let's port our games to PC aswell". 2k15 was an ok port (FOR ME it was ok. I know alot of people hated the port and rightfully so. Thanks "Humroy" for pointing that out), but it lacked in gameplay. Then 2k16 came out on consoles and it looks like a vast improvement, which made me pre-order it in February, when they announced the PC Version.\n\nWell after a 12 hour download (yeah blaming my ISP there), i got into "playing" 2k16. Unlike others i have no performance issues, but the port is seriously lacking in stability right now. Once you start, you are greeted by a splash screen on Stone Cold Steve Austin for a few minutes, until the game decides to load (same happens when running as administrator).\n\nThen you get into a game, you look forward to butting heads with the likes of Randy Orton or John Cena, and new workers like Sami Zayn (Olé!) and Finn "Don't call him Prince Devitt" Balor. And that's where it starts. During Balor's entrance i was greeted by a crash to desktop. Oh well, i said, that happens in other games aswell, let's try again. Played a match between Samoa Joe and Balor. No crash this time.\n\nThen it was time to start up MyCareer which got alot of praise for the improvements over 2k15s career mode. And it looked great. I created a snobby Hollywood Heel Character, created his entrance, created his move-set.....oh wait. No i didn't. While creating the moveset, the game died twice with a "WWE2k16 is not responding anymore".\n\nAt this point i said "♥♥♥♥ it, that's the final straw" and chose my refund option. Now some people will say: "Uggggghhhh, but it runs fine for me, maybe try this or that. Must be your system!" No, i'm done with that. All i wanted was a great PC port after 2k15s port wasn't that great. Because, hell, 2k16 deserves a great port. The improvements to the gameplay are there (except the submission system, which is straight up garbage), now work on the stability of your port.","March 11","false","1.7"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","37","7","19","2","9"

There's also no purpose, men play female characters just as much as women do.

The creation suite is best suited for fans of American wrestling that want to make all their favorite WWE/WCW wrestlers with the face photo feature. The mask choice is extremely limited, so luchadores and other masked favorites are out of the question. They included the horns for Jyushin Thunder Liger, but left out his mask design. You can forget about WWF/E honoree Tiger Mask, his ears and fur are left out as well.\n\nBut hey, you can probably get Lilian Garcia to say your name.

Though I've long stopped watching wrestling, I've always had a soft spot for the games. In particular, the creating of wrestlers has always been a rather large attraction and major selling point. However, despite 2K16 having a seemingly very robust creator wrestler, it is let down by one, fatal flaw. You can no longer import or have any sort of custom soundtrack. The music that is already in the game is what you have to use.\n\nLet me repeat that. YOU. CANNOT. HAVE. CUSTOM. ENTRANCE. THEMES.\n\nIf you wanted to try and create Alex Wright and have him come out with his WCW theme, forget about it. Wanted to create a character from another game and have them walk out to their theme, nope. Frankly, this is disgraceful and removes a large element of fun from the game.\n\nIt might seem like a silly thing to rage about, but I'd wager for a fair few people, this is a big turnoff. Honestly, had I known this, I would have never, EVER, bought the game.\n\nSadly, I can't even refund it. So I can only look on in sour malcontent as this piece of software squats on my hard drive. Hopefully, some kind soul will create a mod which enable this a critical feature. And the fact I even had to type that sentence is rather obnoxious.\n\nShame on you, 2K. Shame on you!\n\n*Extended*\n\nThis is my first wrestling game since 2K14. I had no idea they'd removed this feature from 2K15, as I avoided that game given all the negative reports. Again, it seems like a silly thing to gripe about, but once you've had the option to have a creation walk out to a certain type of song (be it serious or silly) you don't want to go back. It just help establish an identity for your creation.\n\nI mean, honestly, if I can't have wrestlers walking out looking all serious and moody to the Pokemon tv theme - what is the point?\n\nNo long can I have Nintendo vs. Capcom vs. Sega vs. Sony wrestling abominations walking out to their respective themes - le sigh -\n\nI'm sure the game play and mechanics are fine once you've got used to them. But unless they're a return or a massive improvement on the wrestling games from the N64 (No Mercy, Revenge, 2000) then I don't have too much interest in playing the actual game - expect for drunken throwdowns with friends (again, where the entrance's are a major part of the fun).\n\nNo, the creation options are what I'm interested in these days and though I'm disappointed that there is no create a story, I can still create a fictional promotion and characters and mess around every now and then (See above). This isn't a serious game for me, I have no interest in the Online. This is purely for me and my friends.\n\nThe purpose of this review is for people who are in the same boat as me. If the tools are released for modding (as I'm sure they will be) then by all means, come and have another look and then judge for yourself.\n\nUntil such a time, however, beware.","March 10","false","93.7"," 9 of 36 people (25%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","25","9","36","3","5"

There are only a few of the characters this time around that look like muppets, which is a good thing.  Lex Luger looks... like he was carved out of foam rubber and someone is working his mouth hole with a hand slid up to the elbow.\n\nThe only thing I dislike is the new, worse "mini-game" you have while kicking out of a pin.  It seems like you HAVE to do it, even if it's a pin off a clothesline 3 seconds into the match.  Otherwise you're Jeff Jarrett waiting for Hogan to pin you.\n\nSpeaking of, Hogan's not there.  His leg drop isn't there.  Any Hulkamania isn't there.  And I'm fine with that.  For me it's not about racisim and a terrible sex tape... It's that I'm over him.  What bugs me is 5 itterations of a man who held up two title matches (Warrior) but only one version of old, wrinkly, moobie Space Mountian (Flair).  I mean give me a Clash of the Titan's version of Ric.  Give me a 90's short hair cut WCW Ric.  Give me long hair 80's Ric.  Why devote so much effort into a 3 move body builder who's blown after 5 min's, which INCLUDES the 3 min it takes to run down, shake the ropes, and get into the ring proper.\n\nSorry, went on a tangent.  The models look excelent, the gameplay is smooth, and I can't wait to keep going on my road to Wrestlemania.

The 'Benchmark' tool is pretty much useless as fudging with the settings is how to find your computer's happy zone to run things steady,\n\nAnyway... I figure a patch similiar to what was given to last years edition would solve this these minor issues.\n\nThat said, the roster is all there so no waiting a few weeks for the DLC like last year, there are some control commands that don't make sense to me (the new submission circle system is frustrating as all hell), and the manager on the outside causing distractions can get a bit old before they are eventually tossed from the ringside area.\n\n\n","March 10","true","52.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Haven't explored it much yet, but it looks good\n- New Day: just because New Day ROCKS.\n- You can beat up Nikki Bella with a sledgehammer.\n- Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens are pretty much spot on (they're the first match I played - Sami's entrance is brilliant)\n\nNegative:\n- No four horsewomen: Yes, another person saying it. The three women in the triple threat at 'Mania, and the NXT women's champion aren't included, and won't be included. Community creations may well cover it - but they shouldn't have to. WWE should be embarrassed about this.\n- Some things are a little outdated. Paige is the NXT women's champion, for example. But I guess, with no Bayley... and Emma isn't Evil Emma.\n- Amore and Cassady are included, but no Carmella. Same applies to Blake and Murphy - no Alexa. Again, a little bit lacking, considering the depth in other areas.\n- I tried to play online, but it couldn't find a match. Whether that's the game's fault, or just that no one's online, I don't know. But I couldn't play against anyone. So I have to give it a negative mark.\n\nI'll update it if I see anything else of interest, or if I manage to get any online games working - but overall, this is a MASSIVE improvement on 2k15, and while £34.99 (or equivalent) is expensive, if you like WWE, and can get it cheaper, it really is a must buy.\n\nSee you all in game - hopefully!","March 11","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They weren't joking when they said "The Biggest roster Ever". This definitley runs laps around 2k15 and I highly reccomend this game for people who play local co-op often as well as online. Creations this year are amazing and you can do much more now with characters (Such as painting stings face red instead of the default white). The showcase felt a little bland and the startup time for the game takes a bit but overall this game runs smoothly, guarantees hours of fun and is worth the money.

As someone who has 0 issues running or playing the game, I have one or two things that hang me up.\n\n1) I can't turn off the announcers without silencing the refferee's 10 count. The announcers have to be the worst thing in 2k16 (Which is a good thing in some ways). They're beyond annoying and most of the time their lines are lazy.\n\n2) I wish it would put you into a fued with the champion automatically upon becoming #1 contender. People seem to miss that as the qualification for a title match, and will often go months of matches without their title shot.\n\n3) I wish you could have the whole roster be present in My Career mode. Maybe enable an option disabling realism for roster? It'd be cool to have more people to fight. Unless you can and I haven't gotten that far.\n\nOtherwise, 2k16 delivers big and is easily the best thing to happen to WWE games in awhile.\n\n\n(GM mode pls 2k? pls?)","March 11","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Counter/grapling bugs, bugs, and about an elephant s*** ton more bugs that I don't have time to type/think of now.\n\nThe create a show/arena is also a big plus, but with so many issues it's a real pain in the behind to play at times, losing titles left and right due to unresponsive gameplay.

Despite being a huge Steve Austin fan looking at his shiny chrome head for 5 minutes was a bit much. Luckily the running exe file as admin trick worked out perfectly. (although it can still take some time to startup IMO)\n\nPerformance :\n\nNo complaints from me as I run this game at smooth 60 FPS (1920x1080, max details and MSAA enabled) It's a much more reliable port overall with no weird frame dips like 2K15 had. My only niggling issue would be the entrances/cutscenes being capped at 30 FPS it can be a little jarring.\n\nGameplay :\n\nIt's some how more fun than 2K15 while also being punishing to the player. I've lost a fair few bouts this time round and enjoying the challenge something that's been missing from the series for a while.\n\nOther Thoughts :\n\nHuge roster which I love but why wasn't Bayley included? Soundtrack is a lot more drab than 2K15 and I ended up turning off all menu music. Overall though I feel like I'm going to be pumping many hours into this game and highly recommend this title to all rasslin fans (and maybe those that just want to try a new fighting game)\n\n\n\n","March 11","true","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackslaughter/recommended/385730/","jackslaughter","jackslaughter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackslaughter/","27 products in account","The incredible presentation and amazing roster of characters are somewhat tarnished by the new game mechanics used for pinning and submissions.  Computer opponents will kick out of most pins no matter how battered and bruised they are unless you hit them with a finisher.  This can make matches a grind to build up your momentum bar often more than twice in order to win.  The new submission system is clumsily implemented and caused controller breaking frustration at first.  At least 50% of gamers seem to be having problems with this new system for submissions.  I researched online and found some helpful advice from gamers who understood how to use it successfuly, so persevere if you're having trouble with it!  Overall however the pros far outweigh the cons in my opinion.  The insanely huge roster spans decades of professional wrestling and includes a lot of exciting big names.  Improvements to the 'My Career' mode make it even more exciting and involving than before, in many ways this is the best wrestling sim ever made.  It's a huge improvement over WWE 2K15 and if you forgive the two new clumsy game mechanics you'll enjoy some of the rawest, most realistic and well paced wrestling action ever devised for a computer game.","March 11","true","67.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would really like to rebind the reversal button to something other than Right Trigger, because you have to press it so fast, and squeezing a trigger is slower than pushing a button for me.

It has redeeming qualities.  But I bought the game because of the MyCareer mode, and it's not got even 1/10th of the story that WWE games did going as far back as twelve-thirteen years ago.  It's just run to the ring while someone's having a match, now I'm in a rivalry with them, now I fight them a few times, a couple times where they ambush me even though I'm the heel.  And then I win.\n\nMyCareer customization is all surface level, all appearance based and nothing to do with your character.  There's a pretty good amount of options, but it almost makes you feel like there could've been more.  You can sort of Frankenstein a personal entrance out of portions of the entrances of other superstars combined together, but it looks a bit odd if the transitions are off.  There's a lot more customization options which I won't be doing myself like uploading stuff to the game, so I can't talk about it really, but it seems rather robust.\n\nBut customization ends at the appearance of your wrestler.  Obviously a WWE game won't cover the spectrum of possible character archetypes a person could make their wrestler, like anything from a fake police officer to a gorilla to a legitimate martial artist, but nonetheless, the personality they give you is so tame and boring that it's kind of pathetic.  You get 2-4 choices to answer questions, and only maybe 3 words to describe a sentence or two, so I would often choose an option and say something that I didn't want to.  It's a bad system, and reminds me of the problems with Fallout 4's dialog system.  That only occurs in post-match interviews, which are about the only amount of story after nearly 10 hours of play in career mode.  There's the "Authority" option which I've yet to unlock so hopefully that changes things, but it's a very long grind to get to what might end up being a disappointment anyway.\n\nThe gameplay is....okay.  Not good, not bad.  It's fine.  It runs pretty well on my machine.  There's some kind of save game issue which I've not run into but I think has something to do with the amount of saved information you have.  The actual back and forth of wrestling feels much less smooth than I'd have liked, there's some instances when I don't know why I did a particular move vs. another, but in general it's okay.  There's some really bad systems, like the rock-paper-scissors grapple system that I can't really understand and only comes up maybe once every four matches.  There's the submission system which is insanely broken and gives PC a huge advantage.  There's the holds system which is a little too easy, shouldn't even exist because of it.\n\nOverall I'd say skip this one.  It's headed on a decent track, but it feels like it'll be three games before this series is where it should've been five years ago.  There's really good ideas and some awful execution.","April 8","false","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nice to know that 2K stopped being sexist.\n2) In-match optimization better: I no longer have the stuttering and performance issues during the match as I did with '15.\n3) Story Mode: They added a LOT to story mode, including rivalries, allies, picking which championship you want to go for, who you want to invade, all sorts of stuff! It's still got a grind factor, but there's a lot more depth in '16 than there was in '15.\n4) Match depth: There's a little more in-depth match mechanics like the various grappling mechanics which involve a back-and-forth mini-game of who can find the "sweet spot" first. But the game doesn't really tell you how to set that up...\n\nWhat's The Same:\n1) Graphics: Virtually the same engine. The audience is slightly improved. Superstars and the scenery are pretty much the same. Maybe some minor improvements...\n2) Overall fighting mechanics: Same huge sets of moves that are hard to perfect and remember\n\nWhat's Worse:\n1) Submission: The submission mechanic is horrible. The system works like this: The defender has a blue bar, the aggressor has a red bar. The aggressor wants to have their red bar inside the defender's blue bar to fill up the circle in the center. If the circle is filled, the defender taps out. If it becomes completely blue, then the defender kicks out. Sounds fair, right? WRONG! If the body part is undamaged or fully damaged there's no real adjustment to how the mechanic works. It's all skill-based. I can understand that the bars should initially be based off of the wrestler's skills. But as the match goes on, there should be an equalizer. If you damage a body part, the aggressor should have an equalizer to help them get the submission win. What's the point of damaging a body part if you can't even take advantage of it...\n2) AI Kick-Outs: The AI kicks out ALL THE F*CKING TIME! An opponent I was against had no health, no stamina, just got Finishered, but STILL KICKED OUT BEFORE 3! This wasn't even the first time I had done the Special/Finisher combo. How are you supposed to win a match when the AI just magically kicks out ALL DAY LONG???? Then when the AI pins you, I don't even get a chance to kick out on the 1st count, have a tiny little zone for the 2nd and 3rd counts... The imba is real...\n3) Match Rating: The match rating was an issue with '15 and it's even worse in '16. They provide you with a meter in the HUD so you can see how "well" you're doing. Unfortunately, if you do a move once, it can no longer give you points for "variety." This game punishes you for using a move twice... Seriously? It should at least be diminishing returns instead of "you can use a move once, after that, too bad!" I guess the game really wants you to focus on ALL of those moves you picked in the character creation screen...\n\nFor the $25 I paid for it, it's worth it so far. I hope '17 can address some of the issues that '16 has and finally get rid of those nagging issues leftover. Seriously, get rid of the match rating or make it actually worth having as a mechanic. I could get 4 and 5 star matches on '15 and I can't get above 3.5 stars in '16.","April 17","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can also download and run some pretty well put together CAW's from the hub who look like new WWE additions, or some other indie faves or past wrestlers who did not make it in.\nIf you've got the cash now go for it. I picked up 2k15 last year for $13.99 but had no trouble getting this years offering on release day for PC at full price.\n","May 18","true","52.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As there are far more reasons not buy it frankly.\n\nCon's.\n\nStupid bugs that shouldn't be in the game at this stage.. (Some basic superstar walkin's even have bugs.. One looked like it was walking with one boot higher than the other... Stupid things like that are still in the game.)\n\nPre-scripted matches and come backs that put Bulk Bogan to shame.. and you end up feeling worse than Brett did in Canada against Shaun.. ><_><\n\nYou can honestly smash someone around for over 10 mins and then they turn in to the "counter king" and reverse everything.. and even if they have just started the comeback and you have taken your time.. They wipe you out like they have been doing all the bashing.. and then it's good night Viena for you..\n\nBogan might be wipped clean from the HoF and all WWF / WWE content ... but wow.. His screw job style is flying high in this game.. (You know.. The guy who couldn't put his P***IS over in court.) lolol\n\n\nPro's\n\nA HUGE roster and that is about it.. Some nice WCW inclusions with more WCW things to come in 2K17.\n\n","June 6","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
