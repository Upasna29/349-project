Well.. that's probably one of the reasons why I never did a review.\n\nFallout has been, still is and probably will always be my favourite game (series) of all time. Ever since I first laid eyes on the game, somewhere back in 1997, I wish I could live in that same apocalyptic world. The perfect blend of a post-nuclear environment and 50's style, makes it unique and is the reason why I would pick this game over other great games like Baldurs Gate or Planescape Torment.\n\nLike many RPG's, you start of creating your character. Besides sex, there are no cosmetic changes. You do get to alter your skill points and perks. Depending how you create your character, you might get a whole different adventure, each time. Play as a female? You might get some unique conversations. Low intelligence? You can't even speak properly.\n\nThe gameplay is real-time but turn-based in combat. You can do actions, based on your Action Points (AP) and so do your enemies. You can even aim on one of your enemies' parts; cripple his leg, shoot his head or bust his groin... it's all up to you. Your opponents often die in gruesome ways and there are tons of different weapons (melee, guns, heavy weapons, unarmed, energy), different armors for you to wear, tons of items and lots of (side) quests, so you won't get bored quickly.\n\nThe writing in the game is exceptional. Most of the dialogue are interesting and often combined with a lot of (dark) humor. In my opinion, the humor is one of the best aspects of what describes Fallout, something Bethesda never got right (in Fallout 3). Only important NPC's have dialogue, which are often voiced by (former) celebrities like Dwight Schulz & Richard Dean Anderson. The narration is done by Ron Perlman, who rightfully became a Fallout Icon, over the years.\n\nThe music, produced by Mark Morgan, is also excellent. It's without a doubt, one of the best soundtracks of any game. The experimental music creates the apocalyptic atmosphere, perfectly.\n\nI highly recommend Fallout to every RPG lover out there. I could write a lot more about why I like Fallout but it all comes down to this: It's simply one of those games you have to play before you die.","May 7, 2015","true","8.4"," 415 of 431 people (96%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","96","415","431","23","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lifeless_vagabond/recommended/38400/","lifeless_vagabond","boing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lifeless_vagabond/","297 products in account","Let me begin by noting that I was introduced to the Fallout series with Fallout 3, back in around 2009.\nI put hundreds of hours into the game between Xbox 360 and PC, and I found the world to be incredibly interesting and atmospheric. The RPG mechanics and depth were like something I had never before seen, being a teenager and my life having been more saturated with more casualized games such as Call of Duty.\nUp until I finished Fallout, Fallout 3 was my all-time favorite.\nBut now that I've experienced Fallout, it's as if my standards have risen tenfold. It may seem weird given that the game is seventeen years old as of writing this review, but I can elaborate. This game has managed to deliver an experience like no other game I have ever played with simple isometric graphics, and most importantly, a surprisingly complex and mature narrative.\nThe music, sounds, and intriguing -- but again, simple -- visuals create an ambient feeling of loneliness  throughout the wasteland. The soundtrack is hauntingly fitting, for example in Necropolis, a city of ghouls. The sound creepy churchbells amid a fine chord of a low key sends shivers down my spine.\nAdult themes similar to the philosophy of the Ubermensch, and existentialism are very prevalent as well.\nI love this game, and it has shown me the real potential of video games. Books present you with narrative. Films, with narrative, visualization, and sound. Video games, with narrative, visualization, sound, and interaction.\n\n10/10","November 11, 2014","true","18.7"," 256 of 267 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","256","267","4","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/38400/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","Where to start with this game...\n\n'It's a classic' would be a good place to start, I guess. I have no problems say that from the outset. It's only taken me 15 years to get around to play original Fallout, but I can see without a shadow of a doubt why it's so highly regarded.\n\nBefore you play this game make sure to download the Fallout Fixt mod, which is a very comprehensive community mod which fixes a lot of the bugs, and more importantly the resolution for modern monitors. Without this patch you'll more than likely experience a horrible rainbow pixalation effect during videos and gameplay.\n\nAnyway...\n\nFallout is a turn-based RPG series which offers you various ways to tackle the game. Do you want to be a stealthy person, creeping around, pick pocketing your way to glory? Sure, why not! Do you want to be a smooth talking kinda guy who can talk his way in and out of trouble? Go on, be that guy! What about a bookworm who can use his brain to solve puzzles. Yup! And of course you can be a mix of all three, as well as a gun totting maniac! YEE-HAW!\nFor my playthrough I used one of the pre-set characers (Albert) who was a Lawyer in a previous life and was set up with high charisma and speech skills. This opened up different dialogue trees throughout the game, which was nice.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed this game - I enjoyed it a lot. The characters are great, the voice acting (while limited) was pretty nice (though it did give away who the 'important' characters were) and the story itself was pretty deep. The game starts, as always, with you the 'Vault Dweller' leaving your vault for the first time to explore the wastelands. You're tasked with bringing back a water chip to save your vault before everyone dies of thirst!\nThere's a time limit to this, which (for me) cast a sense of urgency. Normally in Fallout games (Fallout 3 and New Vegas) I'm guilty of just going 'WHEEEEE' and exploring everywhere and not really caring what I'm doing. Yet in Fallout there's no time to explore, you've got to save lives!\n... if you want to.\n\nYou see you don't NEED to save their lives, if you don't want to. In fact, you don't HAVE to do much in Fallout if you don't want to. It's not a narrow pathed experience, you can pretty much choose how you deal with the events in the game (and the end game cutscene will reflect on this at the end). A lot of games claim to be an open experience, and the actions you take reflecting on the game world, yet here's a game from 1997 which actually does that. I'm not sure it even heralds that fact that it does this. It just gets on with being a pretty damn good game.\n\nThis brings me on to another aspect of the game - the many different branches of the game. People react to you differently depending on what you're wearing, what you're wielding, and what you're intelligence or charisma is. I find that amaizng now (in 2014), so I can only imagine how mindblowing it was back in 1997 when the game was released. The 'simple' graphics by today's standards shouldn't distract you from what is a very complex game. There's a lot going on under the hood of this game and at times perhaps too much.\nMy eyes were really opened up to this towards the end of the game when I was struggling with killing a certain mob. I had went about it 'head on' and was killed a number of times. Yet, after a night's sleep I came back with a different approach, a more sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s approach and it was so much easier, and strangely satisfying. I had killed the guy and he had never even seen me.\nOK, sure the wastelands were plunged into another 100 years of nuclear fallout in the process, but hey... I KILLED THE GUY!\n\nHowever, even with the Fallout Fixt mod, the game can be prone to crash now and again. I'm not sure if it's the game's memory file getting too big or a conflict with Steam Overlay (wouldn't be a first), but towards the end of the game (and a lot of different quest outcomes) it started to become slightly unstable. So save REGULARLY!\n\nWhich brings me on to another thing. This is an 'old school' game. It will not autosave for you, you must take control of your own save files. If you die you won't be taken back to the next/recent checkpoint... you'll have to load up from the last point you saved.\nThis was the only thing I didn't like, but in the end I learned to live with it and it made me realise how pampered I had become as a gamer. I didn't have autosaves and 10 minute interval checkpoints when I was a kid and I still played games all the time back then. Yet, here I am as a grown man crying about dying and having to go back 20 minutes in the game because I had forgot to save... a lesson in life this game has given me.\nAlso, this game is tough. REALLY tough. Depending on how you build your character, or which character you choose. You will die a lot.\nA lot.\n\nSo in closing...\n\nIf you're looking for an old school RPG experience than I'd recommend giving Fallout a try. I appreciate at time of writing they're no longer available on the Steam Store, or GOG, but hopefully they return one day, as they deserve to be played.","April 18, 2014","true","28.1"," 242 of 251 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","242","251","0","5"

Zero compatibility issues - they have seriously taken GOOD care of the game when they made it available on Steam (I believe it's even running on some MS-DOS emulator but you don't notice a thing about that. Also it comes with some sort of resolution patch). Also, the game is very alt-tab friendly, you can alt-tab at any time without issues.\n- Very good story so far (10 hours in, so can't say everything about it, but so far it's been really good). This game is all about the dialogue. There's an amazing amount of text in this game - and many characters even have spoken dialogue and animations when you're talking to them. I'd go as far as saying the story is on pretty much the same level as 3 and NV so far, in my opinion - with better character building than NV, but more of an RPG touch than FO3 (but I know opinions differ greatly on this part, so take it with a grain of salt, and feel free to disagree).\n- This game has aged very well. I don't exactly know how to explain it, but I actually guess the closest analogy would be the old Pokémon games, gameplay-wise. Top-down view, grid based, turn-based combat. 2D games like this never really get old. You can try to make them look better but it'll just end up looking weird.\n- Price. This game is dirt cheap, I got it for about €1,50 during the summer sale.\n\nNeutral:\n- It's a hard game. It definitely is less forgiving than Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas. Don't be surprised to find a surprisingly large group of surprisingly strong raiders in your path at an early level. And even if you've played FO3 and FONV, you will more likely than not screw up your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. which means you'll have to start over and make a new character early on. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and stats and perks are all rather complicated. I actually like it, though, despite having to start over because I have 1 strength and can't use my guns properly.\n\nThe bad:\n-Resolution. It's locked to 4:3, and although the Steam version seemed to have some sort of Resolution patch and you can set it to your native resolution which lets you alt-tab quicker, you'll still have to either deal with pillarboxing or stretching. The textures also aren't of amazing resolutions, but that doesn't bother me much personally. The art style is amazing.\n- Might be hard to get hooked. Older games aren't for everyone and I understand that. I definitely love it though - and I only bought it during this summer sale. Never played it before. Hell, I was 3 years old when this game was released...\n\nVerdict:\nI personally think this game is easily worth the price they ask for it during a sale. It's old, but they took good care of it when they made it available on Steam. Give it a try!\n\nEdit - 18-1-2016\nI actually did end up playing this game a lot. However, I played it on my phone, in an emulator, so it still shows only 10.0 hours on Steam","June 30, 2015","true","10.0"," 100 of 102 people (98%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","98","100","102","8","0"

With fewer sidequests and a shorter main story, it isn't nearly as long as Bethesda's contributions to the series, however it more than makes up for that thanks to its incredible atmosphere and high levels of replayability.\n\nNow that I've gotten the necessary comparisons out of the way, I'd like to refrain from mentioning Fallout 3 and New Vegas from this point onwards. Yes, New Vegas ties into this game's story quite a fair bit more (considering 3 is something of an offshoot), however what it comes down to is those are two ultimately different games. What you're getting here is a turn-based strategy RPG that is dowright fantastic.\n\nI'll freely admit that the game didn't have me very intrigued when I first booted it up. The graphics were plain, the controls and interface decidedly confusing, and the mechanics unclear. However, after sticking through the game's beginning and unlocking both the world's and the story's fullest potentials, the brilliance of the experience washed over me; this is a game that is entirely dynamic. Every single action your player character takes has an effect in a far more dramatic way than most games, and a whole ton of things can vastly change based on how you respond to the challenges presented to you. I am entirely certain that after my first playthrough last week, I haven't even begun to experience the full depth of what this game has to offer.\n\nThe battles in the game are initially unexciting, yet quickly become more unique. The "Action Points" system, while not entirely original, is still creative enough that so many years later it remains capable of keeping my attention and excitement at a high, something very rare of older RPGs (which are often plagued by interface and gameplay issues that could only be resolved later on with more powerful hardware and higher resolutions). My one gripe is the randomness of the critical hits found later on in the game; some seem to inflict so much damage to the player character that it is impossible not to be killed by them, even when at the level cap and using full power armor. This element of randomness is not appreciated given that it can instantly end the life of even the most well-prepared vault dweller. I also highly recommend you refrain from picking up the "Bloody Mess" perk, as it makes the gory death animations all the more satisfying when they do crop up.\n\nAnd make no mistake, they will crop up over the course of your playthrough, and when they do it is both grim, satisfying, and oddly hilarious. Watching a supermutant clutch at his stomach while guts spew out of them may at first leave you with a grimace on your face, and yet there's someting oddly humorous about the timing of the worm crawling out of his head when he's already been laying on the ground dead for a couple of seconds.\n\nUltimately, it's the little details that make Fallout such an incredible game, especially given how they're able to factor into the overall experience. If you're willing to overlook an initially obtusely difficult set of game mechanics and UI elements, as well as some lacklustre graphics and annoying grammatical errors, what you'll unearth in the original Fallout is a dynamic RPG classic that is entirely deserving of its reputation as one of the greatest Western RPGs to have emerged from the lates 90s.","April 6, 2015","true","19.1"," 97 of 104 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","97","104","0","1"

You create, control, and level up a single character, but you can also recruit others to your cause.  Unfortunately, followers can only have their weapons upgraded in the vanilla version of the game; however, with Fallout Fixit, they can level up and have the armor upgraded like in Fallout 2.\nThe game is short by RPG standards -only about 20 hours- but a low price should offset such concerns.  Furthermore, the time that you do spend in game is what I refer to as quality game play time;  in other words, there are no boring and repetive quests or other filler content that increases game time without really adding to the game.  Your time spent in Fallout 1 will be filled with lighting raiders on fire, taking headshots on super mutants, performing unique side quests, and collecting all manner of new and destructive weapons.\nUnfortunately, Fallout 1 is not without it's flaws.  For one, the grapics are quite dated.  If beautiful graphics are a requirement for you, then you might want to skip this one.  Second, the inventory interface is rather clunky.  Such an interface would probably be considered unacceptable by modern standards, but it's not bad enough that it should destroy your ability to enjoy the game.  Finally, there are other small concerns (such as the inability to move followers that get in your way).  However, these are mostly fixed by the Fallout Fixit patch.  In fact, I highly recommend this patch (see the Steam Forums or do a Google search).  It restores some cut content, makes followers more useful/powerfull, includes the high resolution patch, and much more.\nThe game may be showing its age when it comes to graphics and a clunky interface, but RPG lovers willing to look past these flaws will find a diamond in the rough.  The RPG mechanics are quite satisfying and the world and atmosphere are so captivating, that even after 15 years and 4 other Fallout games, fans still can't get enough.","December 28, 2013","true","19.7"," 92 of 102 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","92","102","0","0"

This single character classless turn-based isometric RPG is still considered a high-water mark of the genre. The quests can be completed multiple ways using multiple character types. The game is loaded with skill checks.  Combat, speech, and stealth paths are all viable and supported heavily right through to the end game. Replays are a must in order to witness this amount of depth.  The writing and voice acting is top notch and the dark/humorous post nuclear setting in an alternate retro-future timeline as imagined by 1950s America is something SPECIAL.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial element is the time limit but I'd argue it adds a good sense of urgency lacking in nearly every other RPG. Truth is it's very generous and can be extended.  For those of us who played the game many times, it's actually moot since the game can be completed in 30 minutes if you know what you are doing.","November 25, 2013","true","0.1"," 143 of 178 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","143","178","0","4"

The awesome  atmospheric soundtrack, the memorable characters you meet (often with a well-aimed critical shot to the crotch), and the broken towns and nuclear wastelands you visit during your journey through southern California all contribute to that special post-apocalyptic "feel" in ways that Fallout 2 can't quite copy, and Fallout 3 is totally unable to achieve.

The lore is deep and intelligent, and packed full of interesting characters, concepts, and secrets for the player to learn about and discover. The debut Fallout game itself is a classic RPG by an measure, and one of the best RPGs of the 90s.\n\nWhile not as accessible as the most recent games in the series, Fallout doesn't lack charm and depth, and for those with the patience to tackle a game that's part classic RPG, part adventure game, it holds a wealth of wonderful fiction to discover.\n\nHowever, As much as it was a great achievement in terms of storytelling and world-building, it is a product of its time and thus suffers from some of the problems that plagued both the aforementioned genres in the 90s: clunky UI, an isometric camera that often impedes movement and blocks items and people, combat that relies utterly on chance with little skill involved, unforgiving difficulty for beginner characters, and - worst of all IMO - illogical solutions to problems that can leave unwitting players frustrated.\n\nYou didn't think to use a radio on that one particular computer? Too bad, buddy, you're stuck\n\nFallout 2 is bigger, streamlines some of the technical issues and irons out some unintuitive features, but I think that this is the superior game when it comes to plot, tone, and narrative. The fantastic voice acting from some great performers coupled with the driving storyline really draws you in and makes you feel like there is something real at stake. The narrative and the world really are the game's strongest features. Complaints aside, I do recommend that any fan of the Fallout series commit some time to discovering this game, and delving deeper into the world of Fallout.","May 25, 2015","true","33.7"," 48 of 51 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","48","51","3","5"

My suggestion would be if you like old school turn based RPG's that can be a challenge, definitely buy this game. The story is fantastic and the gameplay is fun yet challenging. The only complaints would be the few bugs here and there as well as the ending. There's nothing wrong with the ending itself, its just that after you beat the game you cannot continue with your save.

Fallout 1 does\n\nVery few games manage to tell a meaningful dark story while also making you laugh at jokes and references. Fallout 1 does.\n\nVery few games capture the table top rpg experience without losing much during the transition to video game. Fallout 1 does.\n\nVery few games provide a level of replayability that the experience is still exciting years later. Fallout 1 does.\n\nFallout 1 gets so many things right it quickly becomes clear why it overshadowed the very material it was based upon. It has so many short comings and problems and graphically it doesn't stand the test of time as well as other games but to the individual who is willing to take the time to learn the systems and get involved in the world the game offers up will have the potential to lose many hours and restful sleeps as you always want to go on one more adventure or try something in a different way.\n\nThe game is a true role playing experience, to enjoy it for what it offers you need to become less of a power gamer and instead focus on rolling with the punches and taking leaps of faith as you forge the story and personality of your character. You need to become the person who enjoys reading text and develop a love for turnbased combat. Fallout 1 isn't for everyone and coming here from fallout 3-current is going to be jarring and difficult for some, and that is alright, but it is worth the money and time to at least give it a chance as the game rewards you with an experience no other game really has matched.\n\nThe steam version of this game runs fine on modern hardware with little to no setup however installing the fan made community patch 'Fallout Fixit" will make your experience far less buggy, crash prone, balanced, and clean.\n\nI could not recommend fallout enough and it is easily in my top ten games of all time.","November 19, 2015","true","20.8"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","2"

Either fight your way through the desert or just sneak past the things severely affected by radiation, be helpful towards people or let everyone cope with their problems, talk others into things or just kill everyone to get them out of your way...\n\nEverything is up to you in this classic role-playing game, but keep in mind that whatever you do has an effect on the world.

It's world and storyline just sticks with you and becomes part of the basis on which you judge all other games. It is a game that changes all of your preconceptions of how an RPG should play out. What is good? What is evil? Fallout is a game that ask you what is most important, the intention to do good or the end result being good despite the intention. Nothing is simply black and white and nobody's actions are simple.\n\nFallout starts out simple enough, you are a Vault Dweller. Living beneath the earth sheltered from the nuclear devastation above you have never had to worry much about anything until now. Your vault's water chip has failed and there is no spare on hand so the Overseer, the supreme ruler of the vault, nominates you to be the first person ever to leave vault and go forth and procure a new water chip.\n\nAs you leave the vault and begin to travel the outside wasteland you quickly find that you are not the only survivors in this post-apocalyptic world. Other vaults and just plain resourceful people have managed to build communities and the world is rebuilding, for the most part. As you travel around to these communities and their inhabitants question your sanity as you question them about vault's and water chips you quickly realize that a greater threat looms in the horizon, one that neither you nor your vault can ignore for long.\n\nFallout is an isometric with turn based combat, you can recruit companions along the way but the lack of any direct control over them makes them rather suicidal, or in the case of the ones using burst weapons, makes you rather suicidal. The combat is not particularly brilliant but works well enough that you won't get annoyed with it until many playthroughs in.\n\nYou advance your character using the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system, "Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck", and have a multitude of skills to help you along the way. Many of the skills are non-combat related and having high skills or stats can open up new conversation options and previously unseen ways of completing quests and objectives. Most notable is the low intelligence options. While having a low intelligence, and thus very low skills, will close off most of the normal options for you throughout the game it will also create unique dialog and options with nearly every character in the game making it an experience worth a playthrough all on it's own.\n\nFallout's open and extremely non-linear world, it's superb writing and storyline, it's strong and memorable characters and it's unique take on morality makes it one of the best gaming experiences around, worth a play even today.\n\nIt is a game that challenges your perceptions of grey and your perceptions of RPG's. As you travel through the wasteland you'll find greed, hatred, joy and sadness and you'll get to chose to help or hurt, just not always in the way you expected. You'll see things of pleasure and things of pain and you'll get to choose your own way through every challenge as you brave the wilderness of a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nIn the end you will find that your ally is truth, your enemy is a desire to do good and your only hope for victory is tragedy...\n\nBuy it if you don't already own it. Play it if you do.","November 27, 2012","true","316.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

Still good after nearly 20 years. Fallout presents a world that has been devastated by the nuclear apocalypse. Underground containment facilities known as Vaults house the last remnants of humanity and the battle for survival has begun.\n\nFallout uses a hex-grid isometric turn-based combat system. Combat blends seamlessly into its map system, much like games made with the Infinity Engine. It's a fun system, but there's only one problem I have with it - everything takes its turn one at a time. This becomes problematic when there's 20 things on the screen and you spend more time watching the computer make its moves compared to your single move. If there was a way for all NPCs to take their turn at the same time, that'd be a vast improvement.\n\nFor the most part the game aged well. The steam version includes tweaks to help it run on modern systems, which helps immensely. The chat interface is still rather confining, but you get used to it.\n\nThere's a lot of freedom in Fallout.  I have an unhealthy obsession with making and optimizing new characters to suit my play style. You can gun down friend and foe alike, devastate entire towns, and still complete the game. Even though there doesn't feel like there's a lot of quests, Fallout actually takes a fair amount of time to get through without speedrunning.\n\nBut I can sum up why we love the game - Power Armor. After mowing down hordes of raiders while wearing naught but leather, it's satisfying to procure the ultimate badass protection in the land. Oh yessss. And you can reinforce it for good measure!\n\nFallout will likely remain among my favorites for years to come. Being able to create new character concepts and impose new challenges upon myself, I will happily play the game yet again in ten more years. I rate this a 9/10.","September 16, 2015","true","19.2"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theraintransformed/recommended/38400/","Theraintransformed","In-Game DOGG™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theraintransformed/","412 products in account","This is it. The beginning of the Fallout franchise. And what a beginning it was.\nFallout (along with its sequel, Fallout 2, and the spinoff Fallout Tactics to an extent) is an isometric, turn-based cRPG. The main premise of Fallout is surviving in a heavily destroyed post-apocalyptic world ravaged by nuclear warfare. The post-apocalyptic setting of Fallout is influenced greatly by other forefathers of the post-apocalyptic genre in fiction, most notably the Mad Max films and Wasteland, the video game. Interestingly enough, Fallout established itself as an immense influence in the genre not long after the game's release, becoming an iconic flagship of the setting for years to come.\nThe game uses a top-down perspective, and characters can move in six directions, within a hexagonal grid. Combat in the game is based on using this grid-based movement system to move your character around the battlefield, and attack/do other actions using action points. Each character is granted a limited number of action points (AP) per turn, and when their AP runs out, the turn ends, and the enemy party is allowed to act. Fallout's combat system places a large emphasis on planning and forethought, and also on smart and informed character building. Fallout is apparently well-known for its difficulty, and although I disagree with it being a particularly hard game, it may still be difficult for new players to get into because of the depth of the gameplay mechanics, and how relatively badly they're documented within the game itself. While I by no means want to imply that Fallout is cryptic, there are still plenty of things within this game that are tougher for new players to grasp. The game has no real tutorial, and some of the menus are cluster♥♥♥♥s to navigate, resulting in the game taking a while to learn how to play fluently.\nAlbeit the combat of the game is relatively simple, (you can move, open menus/your inventory, attack, and do aimed attacks) the combat system is extremely good, and also incredibly satisfying, especially when it goes your way. Probably one of the best I've ever experienced in a cRPG, in fact. The combat does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it very well, and can even be exploited by players that were careful with their character's build to get great benefits, like being able to get immense criticals by aiming at specific enemy body parts (Rat was critically hit in the eyes for 666 hit points, blinding the unlucky creature. Rat was killed.) or being able to attack more times per turn by stacking AP properly. Fallout encourages powergaming heavily, and greatly rewards players that are experienced in the game.\nFallout's combat is not without its flaws, however. There is at times a frustratingly heavy emphasis on RNG, the best example of which being how the player's chance to hit is always capped at 95%, regardless of their skill in the weapon/other factors. This leaves a window for the player to be able to miss, no matter how ridiculous the circumstances. There is also a rather obscure critical failure mechanic, where if your skill in something is too low (or even if it's high enough) you'll ♥♥♥♥ up on that specific action so hard that you'll break what you're trying to do. Sometimes in combat you'll lose a turn or even break your weapon. While this mechanic was probably meant to make the gameplay more dynamic, it only truly results in making it more frustrating for players, and usually leads to players saving exceedingly often to pad themselves against the game's inherent unpredictability.\nThe game is relatively short by RPG standards, usually lasting around 20-30 hours for most (non-completionist) players, but has an enormous amount of content. While a skilled and dedicated player can beat the game in under an hour if they wish to, there is nothing stopping you from tackling on Fallout's great many side-quests and encounters. There is a heavy emphasis in this game on quality over quality, and it shows, as every event in the game is unique and there is pretty much no copy-pasted filler content.\nAll in all, Fallout is an iconic RPG, in great part shaping both the genres of modern post-apocalyptic fiction, and that of role-playing games, and is heavily befitting of being called a true classic. If you consider yourself a fan of role-playing games and haven't played this, you seriously need to. If you consider yourself a fan of Fallout games and haven't played this, you seriously need to get out.\n\nThe darkness of the afterlife is all that awaits you now. May you find more peace in that world than you found in this one...","December 31, 2013","true","93.4"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","0"

The Fallout universe is so rich and enticing. A lot of people worry they will dislike this game to today's standards because of it's bird's-eye/perspective view, but the story, dialouge, soundtrack, locations, factions and NPCs all come together so well. It is a game you really should not miss out on. If you love the newer Fallout's you should really come back to where it all started.\n\nThere is so many different character builds you can make to suit your style. It has a solid combat system and level progression feels nice. You truly feel your character get stronger as you increase your level, improve your stats and get new gear.\n\nAs you progress through the world of Fallout the way you go about your quests truly effects the world. This also effects the end game, as it shows you how you've effected the world and there is many varying endings.\n\nOverall this is a fantastic game, if you love Fallout, RPGs, tactical RPGs, stratergy games (To some extent) and games that are story driven, Fallout has it all! 10/10","July 12, 2014","true","72.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

I have to admit, that I'm a sort of a fanboy of this game (and for some extent of its sequel Fallout 2). This might be my all time favourite video game. I absolutely fell in love with it back in 1997.\n\nI love the 50s inspired retrofuturistic post-apocalyptic RPG setting. I love the character and combat systems. The overall graphics and especially the brutal ultra-violent death animations still please me. I absolutely love Mark Morgan's ambient soundtrack that reminds me of Aphex Twin's album "Selected Ambient Works Volume II". The player can approach quests multiple ways depending on the character stats. The consequences of player's actions affect the whole Wasteland. The choices really feel like they matter. This truly feels like playing a RPG.\n\nI admit there are some major technical limitations and some frustrating stuff throughout the game (Thanks Ian, for blasting me into a bloody mess with the SMG once AGAIN!), but the Fallout's awesomeness tops all that.\n\nIf you enjoy this, you'll probably also like Fallout 2 even though I find it inferior to its predecessor for screwing up the setting at some parts. (I can't recommend the other sequels and spinoffs, because I haven't played them.)\n\nBut yeah, I really recommend this!

Do some research before buying Fallout 1.\n\nWhere do i begin? You know it is amazing to see how far the Fallout series has gotten. And to think it started out like this. Most Fallout gamers will come to believe it's like the ones you see now.....it isn't. Not even close. Sure it has everything that makes Fallout very well known. But it plays extremely different. The game is two things. Turn based, and RPG. Turn base only happens during combat sequences and the RPG mechanics are completely everywhere. From the "Character creation" when you first start it. To the dialouge and choices you make throughout Fallout 1.\n\nThis game is filled with content and lore that will make your head spin....or to make you rage quit at certain moments. It is best to save often because you will be needing it.....a lot. The skills and SPECIAL sort of works like what you see now. But it handles it a bit differently. My advice, is to do some research on the skills in Fallout 1 and how they work, same goes with SPECIAL.\n\nThe only negative thing i could say about Fallout 1. Is mainly the Action Point system it's your everything during combat sequences from going into your inventory to choosing between vats mode and what i call "shootout mode" (Regular combat).\n\nI could've mentioned the story but it's best if you do the research first before buying like i noted in the "note" section above.

When I was younger, my favorite RPGs were KotOR and its sequel, and I sank like 1000 hours in both I'm sure. So I do have nostalgia out the ♥♥♥ for those games and I do have idealized memories. I played FO1 for the first time in the 2010s, and the experience is so good it stands up to and even towers over the RPGs I loved as a kid. Nostalgia is a powerful force and if you can beat that, that's a really good sign.\n\nThe port job here is actually one of the few times I can say the Steam version of an old game is a completely tolerable  version, as Bethesda has come in and spruced up the game with some updates, most importantly adding the ability to use widescreen resolutions. The game runs pretty much fine, and the only real issue I can remember is it may rarely crash, and if you alt tab, the screen will be black but it has this weird thing where you uncover the screen by moving the mouse? I fonud that bringing up the pip boy or skills menu was a quick way to fix that.\n\nAnd the game is excellent, the theming is incredible, the art design is old but holds up amazingly well to the point that the gore in this game will still make you go "OH ♥♥♥♥ THO". It's an amazingly tight experience, the quests are fun and memorable, the characters are fun and memorable with many of them depicted with these talking heads made out of clay or some ♥♥♥♥ that look cartoony but still look cool to this day. And the music is some masterpiece level ♥♥♥♥, with this and it's sequel boasting some of the best soundtracks in games ever, and this is before they had the disk space to just borrow 20 songs from the 30s-60s so it features mostly original compositions.\n\nI won't spoil anything but I will tell yout hat the lead villain is immediately one of the best in gaming history if not *the* best, the kind that can stand shoulder to shoulder with Andrew Ryan or KotOR 2's easily, but I can't go in to even basic details because spoilers.\nThe game does feature an in-game timer, however this is not something you should be anxious about because your natural pace will probably be more than enough to get you to complete said timer in time, and once you do that you have all the time in the world to explore the world. The only limit from then on is 13 years, but that's a vast amount more than anyone would ever play because even the most slow player would see all the content in the game before that's even close to being over.\nThe controls may be intimidating at first with the classic CRPG interface that we've been distanced from, but trust me, it's not all that hard to learn and most character builds can get through the game fine, Hit, I believe F1, and you can bring up a screen that shows you what everything is and does.\n\nI gotta say, from the bottom of my heart, Fallout 1 is an absolute classic gem even by modern day standards. If you're a modern day Fallout fan, a fan of CRPGs, or just a fan of RPGs, you owe it to yourself to give this a shot.","February 2","true","108.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","1"

Brown Never Changes. - An Official Waffle King Review\n~Find more here.[www.nonm.co.uk]\n\nIncredibly dark, gritty games are very bountiful these days. Almost everything is trying to be THAT game. You know the one. More shades of brown than the cast of a black sitcom. Everything's gotta be super dark and serious. This is war, man. There's gotta be lots of blood and explosions, and brown. This is serious. People die, man. Death is real. It's coming for you.\n\nIt wasn't always this way though. It used to be different. It used to be a happier, more peaceful gaming landscape. Sure, there were serious games. There were games with blood, games with death, and games with brown.\n\nSuper Mario wears brown shoes.\n\nBut you kids that are always ♥♥♥♥♥ing about not having enough color in games and all games being too dark, you don't know. It used to be something special. It used to be a unique art direction. At least until everyone jumped on the bandwagon and completely ♥♥♥♥ all over it. There was an original brown game. A game that said, hey, you know the color brown? Well guess what, it's everywhere. And it was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe original is still by far one of the bests. It's got the unique art direction, the atmosphere, and it's charming in its own special way. In a sort of, giving a Get Well balloon to roadkill kind of way.\n\nFallout is the original grit. Fallout is the original brown. Brown before brown. Rocks and sand before rocks and sand. The first Fallout. Way back in 1997. Surprise, the Fallout series did not start on 3. There was a first game.\n\nFallout is a truly spectacular game. A marvel of classic RPG's, and arguably better than some modern RPG's in what it offers. Fallout is an open-world, turn-based tactical RPG. Set in an alternate future where Donald Trump became president and everything went to hell, you must set off from the safety of your underground vault to repair the satellite so grandma can watch Spongebob again. She gets cranky if she can't watch Spongebob.\n\nThere's a pretty large emphasis on you as the character. There are a few pre-made characters to choose from in case you don't know how to choose your stats properly, but it's best if you make your own. Using the "S.P.E.C.I.A.L." system, which stands for "Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Lemons" you can make your characters as unique as you like. Assign them special skills and traits, and make them special.\n\nNot only do you have complete freedom in creating your character, but the game alters dramatically in how you play it based on your character and your choices. It's like some kind of Mass Effect kinda ♥♥♥♥, but like, before Mass Effect. Can you believe that? They had good game ideas this long ago? That's amazing.\n\nThe major choices and karma system aren't the only familiar elements. There's also a time limit. If you don't get your vault up and running properly again, everyone dies and you're left to feel the shame of disappointing everyone in your life. Also they're all dead.\n\nA tricky gameplay element. On one hand, it limits exploration of Fallout's vast world. But on the other hand, it gives you a sense of urgency in your mission. It helps to drive home that feeling of desperation, of helplessness in a desolate world. It also keeps your playthrough fairly contained and quick. There's more to the game, much more. But with so many choices and options, limiting yourself to one long playthrough instead of a lot of smaller ones limits how much of the game you're actually seeing.\n\nFallout has so much depth, and such a dynamic world. In my time with it, I experienced multiple different and unique playthroughs.\n\nIn my first playthrough, my great hero Dubya set off into the wasteland to save the world. Dubya was a strong guy, but not a smart one. Or one that survived all that long. He spent days crawling through the very first cave, killing every rat he could. Unfortunately, I chose for him to have extra strength at the cost of his accuracy, so the poor guy was trying to punch rats for almost a week. And getting bit, and dying. He finally made it out into the wasteland, where he tried to punch scorpions until he died.\n\nAt this point, I realized that Dubya wasn't working out and made a new character. Nookyalur, the agile Vault person, used her cunning wit and agility to steal some weapons, which she used to kill everything she could. She made it further, and eventually went on to die in a killing spree when she got in a fight with a merchant and his guards. She had to be left behind when she ran out of time, and her vault crumbled without its precious Spongebob reruns. Not the new ones, those are ♥♥♥♥. It's gotta be the old episodes.\n\nIt was at this time that I managed to get a grip on how the game worked. So I simply restarted once more, and didn't ♥♥♥♥ up my character. With my powerful stealth and science abilities, I was able to sneak into a military base and set it to self-destruct. So in one fell swoop, without even equipping my gun, I killed so many things. So many. I got like a million experience points.\n\nFrom there, I managed to break my way into another base, and steal some power armor. I was pretty much invincible at this point, probably. So I saved the world, discovered the mutated remains of Donald Trump's hairpiece, and foiled his plan to end immigration once and for all.\n\nIt was a pretty dank ride.\n\nThough all along my journey were other options. Did I recruit the guy with the gun into my party to help me kill things? Or did I go it alone, and use stealth to my advantage? Did I use my awesome talking powers to convince the bad guys to not kill me? Or did I slaughter them all without even blinking? Or do I agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies and decide to vote for him? I can't choose every choice in one playthrough.\n\nEven though I've played through the game a number of times, there's still so much I've yet to see. There are different endings, different choices. There are areas I've yet to fully explore, even. It's that deep and complex of a game.\n\nOn the other hand, Fallout is pretty old. It's not as pretty as one of the modern Fallout games. It's not as user-friendly with its interface either. The interface is clunky by our standards today, but still definitely usable. It also has that "old RPG" vibe of all but requiring you to talk to everyone and everything. There aren't any glowing trails to show where you're going, or any markers to show what to do. You may even need a guide to help you through some areas.\n\nThat's the only real issue that could turn someone away from Fallout. It's kinda old. And kinda dated in a few ways. At its core, it's still one of the great CRPG classics. C standing for cougar. It's that old, but it's still got it. And probably the mother of something, being that old and influential. So you could say Fallout is a milf, I guess.\n\nMilfs aren't for everyone. Some like them incredibly modern and fresh. But personally, I always had a thing for retro. Know what I'm saying?\n\nIf you can look past Fallout's clunky old interface and admire it for its genius game design and aged beauty, Fallout will be good to you. If not, hey, I bought my copy for like a dollar. Besides, now I can brag about how cultured and refined I am for owning retro classics like Fallout. Like owning bottles of wine you'll never drink. You never know when you'll need to impress your guests with how refined you are. Even if you'll spend the rest of the night throwing up and sobbing.\n\nI feel as though Fallout has taught me valuable lessons though. Lessons about life, and the world. Like, if there ever was a nuclear apocalypse? We'd pretty much all be dead. Isn't that a comforting thought? We'd all be so very screwed, but at least we'd be dead. And that's okay with me.","July 25, 2015","true","7.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","12","16","6","1"

Being the root title in the behemoth of a franchise that it has become, there's nothing quite like exploring a post-apocalyptic Southern California in an isometric view and role-playing with Interplay's primordial SPECIAL system which still offers a unique gameplay experience despite its age. It's going to be jarring to play this game coming from the 3D sequels what with the lack of explanations for the mechanics and skill checks at every turn ala pen and paper RPGs but if you take the time to learn all of its intricacies and having the mindset to play a game like this, you'll be rewarded with a one-of-a-kind experience that only old school RPGs could offer.\n\n\nAnd there you have it.","March 20","true","9.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

For this review I'll divide it into categories of the game and discuss the "Pros and Cons".\n\nGameplay Mechanics\nFallout's gameplay is entirely dependant on the character that you create. This can vary based on the perks and skills you pick up as you progress through the game. The stats of this game are "what make you  S.P.E.C.I.A.L ". Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck. Strength affects your overall carry weight and melee damage. Perception allows you to have more dialogue options, higher ranged accuracy and the distance in which you encounter random hostilities. Endurance modifies your health, resistance to poison/radiation, healing rate and hit points recieved upon leveling up. Charisma is what affects player interaction between NPC's. This stat will give the player the ability to barter more efficiantly and open up dialogue options. Intelligence allows the player to recieve more skill points upon leveling up, more dialogue options and skills. One thing I should also mention is that characters with very low intelligence are very funny to play as. I reccomend doing so if you want a good laugh. Agility allows the player to have more action points in combat and move faster in game. Lastly, Luck grants players bonuses to accuracy, critical damage chance and the gambling skill of the player. Perks also affect your character to further shape what you ideally want. For example, the perk "Small Frame" will give your character enhanced speed and more action points at the cost of strength.\n\nCombat in Fallout 1 is turn based. The amount of moves a player has is dependant on action points. Swift characters may have more action points, but could deal little to no damage if that is the only invested skill. Slow, but heavy characters can dish out loads of damage and possibly tank enemies to give companions opportunities of attacking, but can rarely move due to an undeveloped Agility skill. Combat is entirely dependant on what you want (like stated earlier). The various ways it can be shapen into is what gives this game replayability.\n\nVarious skills such as Barter, Sneak, Lockpick, Doctor, First Aid are the factors that also affect combat. For example, if the player creates a merchant character (someone with high Charisma and Barter) then that player can profit off of NPC's and have access to numerous buffs and expensive items. Characters with high Sneak and Big Guns make great Snipers that pick off enemies and assist companions.\n\nStory\nYou play as the Vault Dweller of Vault 13. The Overseer calls you as he needs your assistance in saving the vault. The water purification chip that provides drinking water to the Vault inhabitants is broken. He asks if you can adventure deep into the wasteland to bring back a waterchip and save the Vault. The player is only given 150 days to do so. This is the only information I feel is necessary to give as Fallout 1's story should really be experienced hands on. The only thing I will also mention is that the story will evolve into something more elaborate as you progress. Please, experience it for yourself. It becomes very philosophical.\n\nImmersive Factors: Music, Atmosphere, etc.\nFallout 1 has an amazing soundtrack. It sets the tone of a dark, morbid post apocalyptic world. It embodies the wasteland that Western America has become. The hatred, emptiness and agony of the people that survived the nuclear destruction is captivated in this soundtrack. Like I said before, experience this for yourself. All I can do is praise it.\n\nThe setting of this game takes place in the west coast of America. Due to the Great War sand and radiation is all that's left in the world. Throughout the game, you will discover settlements, villages, caves and cults. They're well made artistically and the music compliments them well.\n\nThe people of Fallout will vary morally. The characters of this game juxtapose nicely as many of them have different interests. You have people seeking to bring justice and law to the wasteland, greedy and power hungry individuals that only care about their self benefit and an elitest group that I do not want to spoil.\n\nOverall Rating\nIf you're a fan of RPG's then purchase this game immediately. I can say with utmost certainty that you will enjoy this game. You will be kept immersed and entertained. Let this game also prove that modern graphics aren't what make a game. This was released in 1997 and to this day it still has an incredibly large following.","December 13, 2015","true","3.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

There was lots of settlements and other places to explore. The story is great, the soundtrack is phenominal for its time. But as you know, every game has a negative aspect to it. One of them is that combat and getting from point a to be is extremely tedious and it's a little tough being patient with it. I get it, there is some strategy to this and some people like that, and some people like me don't. Probably the reason why I don't like it is because I've played Fallout 3 and New Vegas before this game so it's tough getting used to. The second thing is that you don't have the choice to walk away from a fight and the game just forces you to fight even though you don't really want to. But these issues are minor. Another thing that really catches my attention are the hilarious face models. There is a really funny easter egg in the game that when you click on credits in the menu and type "boom". It will show the creator of the games head being exploded. Anyhow, I give this game a B. Although this game is a little too similar to Wasteland (A game that the creator worked on as well) I would reccomend playing Fallout 2 more.","June 27, 2015","true","8.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Unlike Fallout 3 this and its sequel put more emphasis on role-playing. Make no mistake - there's lots of fights but not that many weapons as introduced in later episodes, plus, there's no VATS system here making a single fight like a cutscene.\n\nA propos cutscenes: there are many such events occurring when we are met by new people - people that are important in the world and can bring the story forward. We complete quests, gather experience points, converse with strange people (even the zombie-like inhabitants of Necropolis), fight mutants and huge, red scorpions - all in a post-nuclear, radioactive, infested world that looks as if the '50s technology was brought forward. This retrofuturistic atmosphere certainly gives a plus to the gameplay.\n\nWhile there are 3 characters pre-made by the creators you can always create your own here with the game's SPECIAL system (acronym for Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck). Plus, you have perks, attributes, skills etc. This is a rather complex system that later iterations of the franchise all inherited.\n\nI know Fallout 4 looks better and uses all the current-gen graphical enhancements but if you want to know where it all started and you have around 30 hours for such a pastime (this is for completionists) then picking this one might just be an exciting story for you.\n\nPS: The number of hours I invested into the game can be measured in the dozens. This was the commercial version that was released way before Steam hence the short time spent with the game here. Still, it was nice to see that the Steam edition works well and offers even a full HD resolution.","May 20","true","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aasha/recommended/38400/","aasha","Aasha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aasha/","111 products in account","Fallout 1 is an old game. It held up decently though.\n\nYou get sent out form your little hole in the ground community to get a new water chip. Because it's a wasteland full of hardened criminals and raiders - and you're the one that's less likely to get killed if you go into the world with merely a rusty knife (seriously a gun would have made more sense but I guess gaming rules have to go the route of "Start with nothing and work your way up").\n\nAs this game's lore goes somewhere in the 1950s the apocolypse happened. The details are pretty unimportant as the war is something that's from a time no one cares about anymore. It was at least a generation or two ago. But the results of it lasted: a wasteland covering the entire world as far as most around can tell.\n\nOne of the first things I discovered in this was it's very eager and able to kick your ♥♥♥. Sometimes simply walking into a public area is enough for the whole place to kil you. if you die you die perminently. if your party members die they die perminently. There's no revive in any sense of the word for this game. And it takes almost no time at all before any ally you get dies if you aren't abusing saves to redo every fight they died in. It wasn't until I managed to get ahold of Power Armor when I started feeling somewhat badass.\n\nIt's possible that I am to blame though what with having prioritized non combat skills such as bartering and speach. I garuntee you'll never have any money issues if you put heavy amounts into bartering and charisma. When you start reaching 90% shops start paying you more than you pay them. So you can actually keep trading the same items between each other and just have them pay some caps on top of that - effectively walking away with the entire store for free if you wanted to.\n\nThe AI in Fallout 1 is pretty terrible. If it's not simply blocking your way so you can't walk through a door for 2-3 minutes straight (and oh does it ever do that a lot) it's jumping in front of you in combat or worse burst firing so it'll kill everyone in front of it - often other party members and yourself. 40% of this game's difficulty comes from the party you babysit. The party doesn't level up with you so they quickly become flat out obsolete. With little to no personality or story surrounding them you really won't feel bad just giving up and letting them die when they die. They're practically faceless. I did find it pretty cool you could have multiple followers though. It actually felt like a party of travelers... until it became babysitting anyway. they lose their appeal when a single super mutant kills all of them with a single attack in your general direction.\n\nThe turn based top-down combat was not what I expected when I started playing. It was honestly pretty good once the followers weren't involved though.\n\nThis game suffered from lacking in explaination for the interface. There were some things that were vital to know - such as how to set traps or disable them, how to use stimpacks or how to use items on the environment (which left me stuck near the end of the game as I didn't know how to hook up a radio to a computer until I looked up help online).\n\nIt also suffered from some nonsense errors throughout the game - such as trying to operate a switch to open a door and getting a "no space in inventory" response.\n\nAlso deathclaws are hell. I have to point them out because ♥♥♥♥ deathclaws. The only way they could be harder is if when you killed them a second one popped out of the carcass of the first - wearing power armor and holding a minigun. And instead of bullets it shot more deathclaws out from it.\n\nIt's a good game. By today's standards I'd give it a 6/10 realistically, but a 7/10 for fan-factor.","June 15, 2015","true","83.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Is still a good classic game and still held up after all those years. You feel like you have to work up your loot, weapons and armor to survive, like in a real fallout scenario especially when you have to talk "smart" to some people and make deals to get on thier good side if you want to progress the game further, and man the beginning is brutel (depends on settings) for me if you don't know what you're doing! The only 3 problems I can think of that bothers me is the trading system has a problem and is you can only trade stuff one digit at a time.\nIs annoying if you have alot of caps. so you have to click it so many times until you reach your number of caps to trade, is ridiculous for how simple it is to fix it. The second is a nitpick and is from the beginning that you have to figure it out on your own how the controls work and which button does it do. Some that are vital like the iconic focus aim shots, I later found the feature in mid game, which I could have learn it sooner before I die alot from the mutants.\nThe third is the fighting system where depends on how many action points you have, you attack on the person, but if the person say 3 guys attack you and you only get one or two actions to attack, the others guys get 8 combine! Even if you're fighting one guy he gets probably 3 or if you're lucky 2 actions. And yes you can increase it, but is so slow to get more action points if you don't know what you're doing. You have to plan your attacks carefully and not strike it blindly which is good, but is hard if you need the exp. Yes, you can decrease the difficulty and plan making a better character but is just my take on my first playthrough.\nThere has been some crashes on my Win. 7 34 bit but only when I input certain commands or moves of the game for reason I don't know why so watch out if it happens. I don't know if it'll work on 64 bit or win 8 but I know they have patches for that on some website that I don't know if it'll work, look it up in youtube.\nI give an 8/10 rated for a classic gem series that still holds up to a fun level.","June 15, 2015","true","30.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's an isometric turn-based RPG. I gave it a shot because I find the Fallout universe so very intruiging. At first I didn't like this game at all. The lack of a tutorial hurt the game a bit and the instructions are very unspecific. But I realized that's the beauty of the game: figuring ♥♥♥♥ out for yourself. There's a lot of depth to the exploration and dialogue. You need to piece it together yourself and explore to find your next objective. The only point where this backfires is after the water chip part. You are given literally nothing to go on after that whereas the rest of the game offers at least some clues. As for the combat, this starts out pretty bad too. You start off with the worst accuracy for every weapon. That gets better but it takes a while to get somewhere with weapons. Once you increase your stats high enough the combat gets intense, challenging, and extremely rewarding. The story is decent. But the characters and locations (Boneyard, Catherdral) are really interesting and fun to explore. Soundtrack and sound effects are awesome too. Lastly, the atmosphere. Probably the best in any game ever.\n\n90/100 - The only reason this isn't a perfect score is because of the very slow start, lack of a tutorial, and after the water chip bit.","September 2, 2014","true","4.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

(and perks/traits.) And it shouldn't be played just because it's the first to do it, but because it does it very well.\n\nIt starts with a simple premise: You live in an underground nuclear fallout shelter (aka, a Vault) 80 years after a two-hour war between China and the US basically ended up in the both countries getting wholly nuked, and the water chip that keeps a supply of water to the whole Vault was damaged, and you were the unlucky one to have to venture out into the outside world to find the closest Vault and get another chip to save everyone you know. You are expelled into a cave full of rats (the ultimate and classic RPG enemy) and have to venture out, the first of your Vault to do so.\n\nFallout's system, SPECIAL, was made in a week (with the exception of perks), and it shows. The original goal of the team, when the game still had a license for GURPS (another system) was that no skill or stat should be useless. Well, first tip to creating a character: dump Charisma and get 4 free stat points. There are also a lot of mostly useless skills, but anyone with half a brain should distinguish the useless from the useful.\n\nCombat is nothing special, except for the gory death animations: When getting crits with different weapons, enemies (or you) will die in very elaborate deaths: getting cut in half by the sheer amount of bullet holes a burst fire of a mini-gun has gave you, for example! It's pretty fun, even though the combat itself lacks tactical depth (sure, you can aim at limbs, eyes and crotch, but you'll end up shooting eyes always - well, maybe crotch for some amusing banter :))\n\nIt's not a very long game, but throughout it you venture through several settlements that have been built   by the surivivors of California. You will have several multi-pathed quests and consequences, though, sadly, most of the consequences are only showed in the slideshow at the end of the game. Still, you will feel that your choices matter.\n\nThe atmosphere is great, with no small influence of the great ambient soundtrack Mark Morgan produced, and the game gets better the more you progress into it: The final two areas have the most different ways of approaching the obstacles presented, and the game ends with one of the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ "final bosses" of game history, if you choose to not kill him directly: You talk him out of doing spoiler , but your speech skill won't do it alone. You'll have to find evidence that convinces him. And then, you will be shown what you could and couldn't do. On the first playthrough, unless you got lucky, you will end up having failed to save a lot of people.\nWell, how about a replay?","January 17","true","17.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Your vault's water purification system has been damaged. It's up to you and ONLY you to wander the wasteland of California to search for a new one.\n\nReleased in 1997, Fallout is one of the most intricate and highly detailed RPG's of the '90s. All of your skills all play important parts in the game, unlike beth♥♥♥♥♥das "Charisma 4: Mass Effect Dialogue Options". There are multiple endings depending on your actions and routes taken, and it's completely up to you what you do with your time.\n\nThe original version of Fallout had a in-game time limit of 150 days to find the water chip. If you ran out, you'd get the bad ending by default. This limit was patched out in the early days.\n\nThe Fallout series has remained one of the most inspiring and amazing RPG games to ever play.\n♥♥♥♥ Bethesda, this is the REAL masterpiece. Don't mind the "fallout 4" ♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the comments of this review. If you are a RPG fan, this game belongs in your library.","November 10, 2015","true","1.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","18"

It may be really difficult for players who have never played anything like this. I'd recommend newcomers to follow a guide to progress further in Fallout, but at the same time, it'd be way better if you play for yourself without any help. Fallout is hard which makes it really entertaining. For instance, finding out what to do next or where to travel to is all up to you. Fallout never gets old as you can make fresh new characters and witness the different outcomes that can occur in game.

If you're a fan of Fallout 3/NV or like old-school RPGs, play the first two Fallout games. Though the functionalities of an older game such as this do take a little bit of getting used to, once you get the hang of it it becomes a rich, very fun experience that is surprisingly similar to what you get in the newer titles. It's actually surprising to see just how much Bethesda got right when translating Fallout 3 into an updated 3D version of the same universe. And although there are some (not uncommon to modern Fallout) glitchy elements which definitely got smoothened out in the second installment, the original Fallout is a fun play even to this day, with an amazing story, hours of gameplay, funny moments, and some good 'ol turn-based combat that features some of the most gruesome and entertaining death scenes I've ever seen.","April 7, 2014","true","83.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","6"

It was released in a time where people had been waiting years for something really groundbreaking to come by in an RPG, and Interplay didn’t miss the mark.\n\nIn order to survive a great nuclear war in this futuristic game, the survivors of humanity sought shelter in underground vaults to escape the nuclear fallout (hence the title). The character is in one such vault, but escaping the wastelands is not the only problem. This vault’s water-recycling chip has malfunctioned and the leader of the community is asking the player’s character to go to a neighboring vault for a replacement. If only a journey in the wasteland were simple.\n\nPlayers find that there are communities on the surface, and they’re scraping the bottom trying to survive just like those below. Gangs that resemble something from the Mad Max series roam the wasteland preying on those struggling to make a living. Some people have undergone transformations; so have some animals. Finding a water chip or other suitable drinking water is not going to be an easy task.\n\nThe game system takes some time to get used to, but not so much that it detracts from the enjoyment of the game. Mostly a mouse-driven game, players have cursor options to select actions, conditions, and manage inventory. Taking care of said inventory isn’t a comfortable process, as players are forced to manage all loot in a single columned interface.\n\nFallout does some things quite well. Character creation is quite thorough, including optional traits and perks to enhance characters’ starting abilities, making him/her unique. Fallout’s creators also attempted to implement a system of “right and wrong,” and player interaction with NPCs is affected by Karma. As two more examples, sound and music both compliment the story environment without going over the top.\n\nLike games of the time, there are some things that greatly under-perform. Most roaming NPCs are fairly useless for more than a grunt, snide remark, or comic relief. While players can recruit companions, they have no control over them, allowing for situations where the recruits will shoot players (and other NPC companions) in the back or block the path. They do not target what the player targets most of the time, and players will notice when trying to do something nefarious that combat will provoke NPCs to target other people, including children, which just cause one’s Karma to bust. Also, players’re forced to trade with them to provide them any resources. They don’t wear armor or gain levels making them weak and pathetic in the end-game.\n\nThe presentation of the story is both humorous and enlightening. The previously touched-on story is set in the future, but most everything looks like it came out not long after World War II. What’s left of civilization is surviving under the tow of two-headed cows while rusting autos and modern technologies similar to our era are strune about. Bottle caps are the currency of choice and iguana sticks are to die for.\n\nAll things being said, Fallout is still one of the best RPGs ever made for the PC and sparked a great trend. It is true that it came out around the same time Blizzard released Diablo, but Fallout breaks the mold.","November 28, 2013","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

With the release of Fallout 4, I felt that it would be fun to replay the game that started it all. Released in 1997, Fallout was a hit and even now playing it 18 years after its release; it essentially holds up.\n\nWhile the last 3 entries are very first person orientated with more frenetic action then the others; the original fallout is a 3rd person isometic turn based rpg that still offers an open world and an enriched story. The character creation is essentially the same as you distribute points in the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system as well as choosing skills and a few perks of choose from a few premade characters.\n\nThe base story seems very reminicent of Fallout 3, and like it once you leave the vault can do as you please. However, the game appears to be time sensitive and while I have no clue as to the consequences of failing have come across many sidequests in addition to the random encounters exploreing the map.\n\nOne thing I do want to stress is that unlike modern games; the user interface has a somewhat steep learning curve. By that, I mean asside from saving, you must manually reload weapons, and items are only used once at time. Bartering ( which later games simply became shops ) is broken down as placing items you don't want into the middle which will provide a cap value and then you choose items from the other party equal to or less of the value. ( Cap item limits max at 999. so if your trade was 1500 caps you would move 999 caps from other party and then additional 501 caps. NOTE: you can use the numeric keys for the value )\n\nOverall, Its been a blast to play this game; and while very slow paced I cant help but appreciate the amount of content here in a game nearly 20 years old. If you a fan of the Fallout franchise, you owe it to yourself to give this game a chance and I would recommend anyone on the fence to checkout out some youtube videos of the gameplay. Its regularly 9.99 but during any number of steam sales is probably 4.99 or under.\n\nIf you found this review helpful or opinions of what could improve my next review, please  feel free to send me a message.","December 22, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It perfectly blends retro-futurism, post-apocalyptic     surivival, and dark humor to create a very unique universe that is fun to explore.\nYour character matters: How you build your character and the choices you make really do change the story much more than in your typical RPG.\nI love turn-based combat. While a little rough around the edges it still holds up.\nThe game focuses on your character. While you can get companions the story revolves around you and I really prefer this to having to manage an entire team of characters as I find it more immersive and am better able to role-play.Cons:\nThere are bugs. They shouldn't stop you from enjoying the game and there are fan-patches you can get that improve the game.\nBy today's standards the game can feel a little directionless. Try to embrace it but if you get stuck or lost you can always find a guide online.\nThe combat AI can be frustrating. For example, if you give a companion an automatic weapon they are just as likely to end up killing you as they are to kill your enemies. There are work arounds of course but it would be nice if the combat was a little smoother.Bottom line, Fallout is truly a classic that spawned a huge franchise.

Well, for starters, it's a stepping stone to possibly one of the greatest game series of all time,  the Fallout series (Obviously), you may be more akin to Fallout 3 and New Vegas, but both Fallout 1 and 2 are an entire different breed of game altogether.\nThe game starts off in a Vault, Vault 13 to be more specific. A water chip, that keeps the Vault's water supply clean, but then all of a sudden, it breaks. The Overseer, sends out YOU to find a new Water Chip, setting in motion the Fallout series.\nThis game is not totally freely explorable like New Vegas or Fallout 3, it's timed, so you don't want to spend too much time in one place, it take's 150 days to find the Water Chip, which will be marked on your Pip Boy (Not a wrist pad in this version, but rather a small device), the game explains the origins of the NCR, and Super Mutants, and other places.\nThe combat is turn based, not first person, so you're going to have to take individual turns with you and your enemy when attacking, (I.E You attack first, but only for a certain number of times, the enemy attacks after, with the same set of rules.).\nThe plot can be changed, but there is a canon ending which i will not spoil, you should play it for yourself and see what you do to effect the games endings. You can check out guides and other stuff to help you along your way.\nOverall, it's a excellent game, not meant for everyone though, the time limit can limit your experience wether you want to do side quests or not, and the combat can be a little too tough aswell.\nBut i recommend it, make sure you play this if you want the full Fallout experience (Along with Fallout 2 of course.)","September 25, 2014","true","151.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fallout is hard which makes it really entertaining. For instance, finding out what to do next or where to travel to is all up to you.

There are multiple ways to play this game.  You can be a bit of a diplomat, talking your way through the game.  You can use fire power to blast away most enemies.  Or you can look for a different approach, like finding an important computer and activating the self-destruct sequence of a place and leaving.\nThis is an older game, so don't expect great looking character models.\nCharacters you find and add to your group can also be a pain in the butt at times.  They may fire at an enemy behind you, only to hit you instead.  Or they may block a door way and you have to wait for them to move.\nI did run into some gameplay issue with the more update version of the game, causing the game to crash.  I had to load up the older version to get around this.  Thankfully, this only happened in to areas of the game and did not ruin things (I was able to load up the updated version once I was past the area where the game would crash and would save there).\nThis game can be difficult at times, as things may look favorable for you only to see your enemy get a BS lucky shot on you and kill you.\nOverall, I really like this game, especially the ending.  After years of playing Japanese Role Playing Games, I got kinda tired of seeing everyone live happily ever after endings.  This game ending is harsh.  More fitting for the world of Fallout and the landscape, the Wasteland.  If you do plan to play this game, I do hope you do NOT look up the ending on YouTube.  It would possible ruin the experience for you and the work you character does in the game.","February 10","true","44.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is an incredible amount of depth to the world that you can inhabit. Time to go 'in depth' for my new review style.\n\nGameplay\nFallout 1 is an isometric RPG. It is, obviously, a little archaic. There are several different mouse pointers you must constantly alternate between to either examine, move or fight things. The combat is simple yet satisfying, with enough weapons and different combat approaches to each encounter that it can stay fresh. Moving through the desert is a harrowing, luck-based affair, with a grid-styled map that you can move through showing the world. Places of importance are highlighted in green, and random encounters stop you on your journey to keep it fresh. Overall, Fallout has impressive gameplay that stands up to the tests of time.\n\nStory\nYour vault is running out of water. You are the last hope for your entire vault. This plot hook, though good, actually limits the game. A time limit is placed on you of 150 days, and if water is not obtained for your vault before the end of those 150 days, you will 'fail' the game. This places unnecessary pressure onto your shoulders, although it is incredibly effective at keeping players on the path of the main story. However, this leaves you with little opportunity to delve into other side missions or characters. Several characters will have to be made before you can experience everything.\n\nGraphics and Atmosphere\nQuite obviously the graphics are not going to be current-day good. Don't expect high quality graphics, and if you criticize the game for it's graphics... well then, what do you expect?\nIt's the atmosphere that really sells the game. A broken landscape with intriguing characters and it's own, unique brand of humour really sells the unique vibe of a civilization that never got out of the 50's, and then got nuked. It's very enjoyable just to explore, even if there is no music.\n\nSummary\nFallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game is a game that is very much worth your time. With a low asking price and hours worth of fun, there's very little reason that you shouldn't pick up the first Fallout, especially at a time like now when the future of Fallout is coming... why not return to the past?","August 29, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Or you can look for a different approach, like finding an important computer and activating the self-destruct sequence of a place and leaving.\nThis is an older game, so don't expect great looking character models.\nCharacters you find and add to your group can also be a pain in the butt at times.  They may fire at an enemy behind you, only to hit you instead.  Or they may block a door way and you have to wait for them to move.\nI did run into some gameplay issue with the more update version of the game, causing the game to crash.  I had to load up the older version to get around this.  Thankfully, this only happened in to areas of the game and did not ruin things (I was able to load up the updated version once I was past the area where the game would crash and would save there).\nThis game can be difficult at times, as things may look favorable for you only to see your enemy get a BS lucky shot on you and kill you.\nOverall, I really like this game, especially the ending.  After years of playing Japanese Role Playing Games, I got kinda tired of seeing everyone live happily ever after endings.  This game ending is harsh.  More fitting for the world of Fallout and the landscape, the Wasteland.  If you do plan to play this game, I do hope you do NOT look up the ending on YouTube.  It would possible ruin the experience for you and the work you character does in the game.","February 10","true","44.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

THe graphics are of course outdated, but are still useable for many modern gamers. Gameplay is easy and diverse. Fallout in no-way lets railways you onto one direct path and is the true example of the unforgiving wasteland that we all know and love. Fun game you can play casually.

The gameplay and story are compelling, but the world is the real star of the show here. That, and Harold and Dogmeat. They're stars too.\n\nTips for companions:\n\nDogmeat is a machine. Doesn't do much damage, but moves ridiculous distances, attacks 4 times a round, knocks enemies down all over the place so that you can 95% critical their eyes, and, most importantly, is the emotional heart of the story. I kept him alive all the way.\n\nTycho is great. He's smart, durable, and funny. Just keep him stocked with shotgun shells and Stimpaks and he'll never let you down. Unfortunately, he died in the Cathedral.\n\nIan is a staple for the first part of the game, but by the time you get power armor he's basically obsolete. I let him go eventually.\n\nKatja can mark the Cathedral on your map. That's about it. I made the mistake of giving her an SMG, and eventually abandoned her along with Ian. Hopefully they're fine in the middle of the desert.\n\nP.S. The gory death animations are fine, but the fact that they're used as rewards for winning makes them that much more priceless.\n\nP.P.S. I accidentally dropped Vree's holodisk moments after getting it in the Brotherhood base, later realized how important it is, went back, and, months later, it was still there. The Brotherhood really needs a janitor.","June 28, 2015","true","88.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakenandLoved/recommended/38400/","TakenandLoved","Kaz (Loves Boo❤)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakenandLoved/","157 products in account","Where it all started, Fallout. Before Bethesda got the rights to the Fallout series and gave us the wonders of Fallout 3, New Vegas, and 4, Fallout was owned by Interplay and Black Isle studios. The classic Fallout games (1-tactics) were isometric turn based rpgs with a heavy open world exploration aspect to them. Now, jumping away from the history lesson and back to the game at hand. Fallout is a gritty, post apocolyptic rpg set after a nuclear war. And it really shows, raiders, super mutuants, anything in this wastland can be a friend or most likely a foe. The game can be very diffucult if you don't know what to expect. Everything you encounter, from cave rats to the brotherhood of steel, can kill you. Here's some spoilers, so don't touch if you don't want the story ruined. Ready? Alright.  You're tasked by the overseer of vault 13 to find a new water chip for the vault, as the one they have has died and water is running low. Setting off into a cave and the huge wastes, you must find a water chip and destroy the ever looming threat of the supermutant army, led by the Master. Once you complete these tasks in any order you please, you return to the vault you just saved....only to be banished.  If you're looking for a long, difficult at times, classic rpg, you should turn to the classic Fallout series. A definite must buy for any rpg fan.","February 7","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

The waterchip is used to fix up radiated water.\nOne thing i really love about this game is that you can complete all the main quests without any help or given locations.\nLike for example one girl actually knows where to find the waterchip and it is in a place that you could get a holodisk to find or you could just travel around the wasteland until you find it.\nanother thing is that the water quest is actually timed so you have about 120 days to find it or else you loose the game!!\n\nSo now i will give  pros and cons about ths game\nPROS\n-gameplay that works\n-great story\n-pretty good graphics\n- talking like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with low intellgence skill\n-TOO AWESOME\n-can be played on pretty much any computer\n\n-CONS\n\n-no journal, what i mean by that is that i tried doing a quest for someone and he said something about go west then south when you find this place and then kill them, but i completely forgot where to go and he didn't mention it again so i either had to remember it or write down on a piece of paper, it's not a big deal but i didn't like it :(\n-too short dunno man i just wanted more.\n\n-MY OPINION i only thought this game was awesome when i had good guns and protection, but that's just me and not really a con but i had to mention it.\n\n-No freeplay after main quests, this really sucks if you have unfinished side quests that play a big role but actually in the end the narroter tells about what happend to ceartain places if you didn't help them which is really cool ;D\n\nSO overall i think that this is one  of the best RPGS ever made even though i'm not a hardocre RPG'r,\ni will say that this is proabaly one of the best games that i ever played in my life, AND i cannot wait to play fallout 2 i'll just wait for a discount though.\n\nOKAY I'VE TALKED ENOUGH THIS GAME GET'S A 8.9/10\n\n","January 25, 2015","true","42.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Occasionally, inhabitants will be immersed in dilemmas which the player may choose to solve in order to acquire karma and experience points. Fallout deviates from most role-playing video games in that it often allows for the player to complete tasks in multiple ways, often choosing solutions that are unconventional or even contrary to the original task, in which case the player may still be rewarded. The player's actions may ultimately dictate the ending of the game, or what future story or gameplay opportunities are available. Ultimately, players will encounter hostile opponents (if such encounters are not avoided using stealth or diplomacy), in which case they and the player will engage in combat. Non-combat portions of the game are typically played in real-time.\n\nCombat in Fallout is turn-based. The game uses an action point system wherein, each turn, multiple actions may be performed until all points in the pool have been expended. Different actions consume different numbers of points, and the maximum number of points that can be spent may be affected by such things as chems or perks. 'Melee' (hand to hand) weapons typically offer multiple attack types, such as 'Swing' and 'Thrust' for knives. Unarmed attacks offer many attack types, including 'Punch' and 'Kick'. Players may equip at most two weapons, and the player can switch between them by clicking a button. The Perception attribute determines characters' 'Sequence' number, which then determines the order of turns in combat; characters with a higher statistic in this attribute will be placed at an earlier position in the sequence of turns, and subsequently get new turns earlier. Perception also determines the maximum range of ranged weapons, and the chance to hit with them.\n\nI Would Recomend Fallout To any fan of the Series Or Newcomer.","December 18, 2014","true","12.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I still own my original disc copy, which is still in perfect condition. I recall in '97 going into my local PX and picking up the retail box from the shelf, and reading the description of the game on the back while deciding my future purchase. Had I known now how much I would come to love this series, I would have bought another copy to keep as a collector's item. Starting up my first game and hearing Ron Perlman's words; "War. War never changes..." still sends chills up my spine to this very day. (By the way he still does the intro narrator voice for the series.)\n\nThe freedom of choosing your own way to advance in the game was different from most of which I had played at the time. The writing was witty and found my self laughing over some of the more hidden speech options. (Roll a character with a low INT, many LOLS to be had.) I found the combat enjoyable. You can target specific parts of the enemy's body, which allow you to cripple limbs and increasing critical damage. It may seem dated in appearance by today's standards, but makes up for that in quality story and plot. Now go get that water chip vault dweller.

I grew up with Atari, Apple ][e, PowerMacs, NES, and so on. Fallout uses the good old 800x600 overhead isometric view, and does it quite right. The game has a fair amount of variety in the appearance of the locations, though the "cave" areas tend to get a bit too familiar. There is a ton of variety in the objects used, and a lot of areas are just really nice art to look at. It holds up for me, personally. Objectively, it looked great when it came out, but was kind of bashed a bit for not being a light sourced 3D game. Those were the expectations of the time.\n\nThe best part about the various character models in the game is the way that they are torn apart, melted, disintegrated, exploded and otherwise ended when you discharge your fury on them. The flamethrower is good for laughs, especially. It certainly followed through on the vision of its spiritual predecessor, Wasteland, in that respect. The dialouge sequences with certain characters brings you to a great looking 3D model of the character's animated head, but other wise all characters are rather small and faceless.\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SOUND ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe music, combined with the graphics, creates a thick, perfect layer of atmosphere. The desolation and tension of this setting really is emphasized by the great music. Composer Mark Morgan totally nailed it. The various gunshots, laser beams, rockets and explosions of combat all sound great. The 10mm Handgun especially has a very satisfying "THUD" to it.\n\nThe voice acting is frigging phenominal. Frank Welker, Ron Perlman, Tony Shalhoub, Tress MacNeille, and a bunch more take care of voicing the metric ton of dialouge that exists for all cut scenes and plot "essential" characters. It all sounds so good, you will want to have the sound and music turned up nice and loud while you play. Really, really good.\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GAMEPLAY -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nMovement while exploring is similar to Diablo, point and click to go. When combat starts, the game switches to turn based mode. This is where how you build your skills and equip your character matters more than how fast you can click on different things. It is possible to gimp your character, and die repeatedly if you don't pay attention to some basic survival needs. Such as at least one strong combat skill, and average intelligence at the very barest of minimums. Intelligence is responsible for getting more points to put into skills when you level up. One or more of your various skills is going to determine your success in pretty much everything you can do in this game. Speech can be a path netting some extra information and reward often enough that I find it useful too. At least a smattering of everything will come in handy, but I personally wouldn't go without lockpick, medicine (for healing and for quests), and science. For combat, anything will do, but bear two things in mind. Be the best. Choose one of the various combat skills, and pump points into it every level until it is at least 75. Then keep rasing it, but it isn't so much of a priority compared to diversity at that point. Smal guns are the most widely available, but don't let that keep you from choosing your own path as they are all viable.\n\nIt is possible to "play the bad guy" and destroy your karmaic reputation in order to steal, murder, and otherwise plunder the shambles of a society that remains on Earth. Indeed, some quests and items are most easily and quickly performed by stealing something, or locking the door and murdering someone. But, your karma follows you around in this game. At a certain point, you will be unwelcome. Then, people might want to kill you for what you have done. I find that the path of the righteous leads to far greater reward in terms of XP, in this game.\n\nThere is a wide variety of weapons, armor, enemies, and locations for battle. The battles can play out rather slowly, and being turn based are not everyone's cup of whatever. The game can be rather challenging at the start if you aren't used to these sorts of games, but the difficulty can be changed at any time in game.\n\nThe game is kind of equal parts combat and exploration. There is a great deal of humor in both, and I have spent plenty of time just watching random NPC's interact with each other. It all piles on to the atmosphere of the fledgling civilization struggling to survive in the harsh new hell they created, only to be found repeating the same death spiral pattern of behaviors that set them on the path in the first place.\n\nIf you aren't immediately turned off by the graphics and the turn based nature of the game play, then this game might be for you. It is one of the precursors to such games as the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale serieseses.. es. Planescape Torment. Shares team members with Knights of The Old Republic 1 and 2, Fallout New Vegas, Arcanum, and a few more greatest role playing games ever. (KOTOR 2 and Greyhawk have at least been fixed and patched to greatness on PC...) But Fallout and Fallout 2 have always been my very favorites and the most replayed. If you dig a little, you will find that there is a ton of depth and character in this rather slow paced old school game.\n\n(Never you mind what the "hours played" on Steam says, my Steam was mostly offline for intermittent years. When I played the game for hundreds of hours since its release, it was the CD-rom version.)","February 5, 2014","true","26.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Its a very fun experience, but pretty damn short (I finished my first playthrough in only 4 hours, with a guide). However, the game promotes multiple playthroughs since there is a large variety in the skills you have. You can pretty much play the game without ever having to kill people thanks to speech checks and all. This game doesn't really hold your hand though and it can sometimes be easy to get lost (and was one of the reasons I had to get a guide after a certain point). It can also throw you into a lot of situations where you just end up dying, so remember to save often.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakenandLoved/recommended/38400/","TakenandLoved","Kaz (Loves Boo❤)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakenandLoved/","157 products in account","Where it all started, Fallout. Before Bethesda got the rights to the Fallout series and gave us the wonders of Fallout 3, New Vegas, and 4, Fallout was owned by Interplay and Black Isle studios. The classic Fallout games (1-tactics) were isometric turn based rpgs with a heavy open world exploration aspect to them. Now, jumping away from the history lesson and back to the game at hand. Fallout is a gritty, post apocolyptic rpg set after a nuclear war. And it really shows, raiders, super mutuants, anything in this wastland can be a friend or most likely a foe. The game can be very diffucult if you don't know what to expect. Everything you encounter, from cave rats to the brotherhood of steel, can kill you. Here's some spoilers, so don't touch if you don't want the story ruined. Ready? Alright.  You're tasked by the overseer of vault 13 to find a new water chip for the vault, as the one they have has died and water is running low. Setting off into a cave and the huge wastes, you must find a water chip and destroy the ever looming threat of the supermutant army, led by the Master. Once you complete these tasks in any order you please, you return to the vault you just saved....only to be banished.  If you're looking for a long, difficult at times, classic rpg, you should turn to the classic Fallout series. A definite must buy for any rpg fan.","February 7","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

Instead of pulling up your Pip Boy and selecting a place, you have to actually leave your current city, then travel to the next. You're shown a map of the whole area and once you click somewhere, your guy moves as in-game time flies by at a realistic and believable pace. You also slow down at mountains and stuff, to make it seem more like you're climbing them. Occasionally, you get a random event which stops your traveling and gives you more of a feeling like your actually adventuring\n\n-Combat system is hard to get used to\n-Enemies can be a bit too tough at times\n-If there are too many enemies, you're going to die, no matter how much skill or luck you possess\n-If there are enough NPCs during a battle, you have to wait forever for your turn as each NPC moves and attacks one at a time, especially during missions where you help escort the Crimson Caravan\n-During such battle, I bet I could walk away from my computer, make a sandwich, and come back and still be waiting for my turn\n-Turn based combat is annoying and confusing before you learn how it works, which is not easy because it isn't self-explanatory in any way\n\n+/- Even though it's Fallout, it has a completely different feel if you're like most Fallout players if you've only played 3 or New Vegas. I like this fact, but I can imagine that others wouldn't\n+/- Neurtal NPCs react to you unholstering your weapon.

And war… war never changes.”\n\nFallout is one of those rare role-playing games oozing quality from every pore – one might even say radiate. The gameplay is smooth, using action points for movement and combat. In addition it has one of the best character development systems you can wish for. The amazing story, great love for detail and high replayability make for an excellent gaming experience.\n\nFun fact: Fallouts retro-futurism has been inspired by 1950s pulp magazines, superhero comics of Atomic Age and classic Science Fiction films such as Forbidden Planet. There are also many references to the events and the style of Wasteland (PC game from 1988) in the Fallout series, which is why Fallout is sometimes regarded as a spiritual successor to Wasteland.\n--\n\nMy rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:\n\n-	Atmosphere\n-	Characters\n-	Details\n-	Tactical gameplay\n-	Story\n-	Combat & Controls\n\nBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading:\n\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).\n--\n\nAtmosphere: S-Rank\n\n(I am the bringer of death!

Your mission: Find water. You only have a certain amount of "days" to do that (in game the time does not stand still). I don't know what happens if you fail, to be honest.\n\nYou will have no one holding your hand in this game. No one. You have no quest log (as far as I can tell), you only find out what to do and where to go by talking to people (no, they do not have exclamation marks for quests). They give you missions, directions, intel, etc. These missions will have consequences. If you simply murder stuff or do shady deals and people find out, you get negative karma points and some people will be hostile. That being said, the choices you can make are rather nice, but can also screw you over. There are good walkthroughs out there if you want the optimal way to play, i.e. where to go, who to talk to and how to get the most XP and bottle caps.\n\nThe latter are the game's currency. Although you do not strictly need them, because everything can be bought with everything. All items in the game have a certain value and you can simply trade them in. However, items also have a weight associated to them, so the bottle caps are definitely worth having. You can, of course, only carry so much (depends on your strength value). However, there is a trick, whereby your companion, which you can hire or not, can seemingly carry an unlimited amount of items. Of course he won't give them back to you for free, but you can steal it from them and they won't complain apparently.\n\nYour starting values and skills will be important and you can already mess up the game here. Every now and then you get a level up and can choose a new perk or upgrade one (not every levelup). You can also invest skill points into your various skills, from picking locks, to sneaking, conversation, healing or different combat traits. You can level a skill up to 100%. I would strongly suggest to invest into small arms initially, as most weapons, especially early on are in that category (from pistols to shotguns to rifles). And missing in this game can be your death.\n\nCombat is done turn based with action points and initiative. The values are often hard to gauge though. In any case you will usually have some sort of firearm and armor equipped. You can swap weapons mid combat, but it costs action points (AP). Everything costs AP. You can either fire your weapon unaimed, which costs less AP, or aimed. The latter allows you to target specific parts of your opponent. For example shooting and wounding the leg causes monsters to be slower (i.e. lose AP). Shooting the arms may cause opponents to miss more. Shooting the eyes give you a chance of blinding them. And a headshot can potentially do the most damage. Of course your hit percentage depends on your skill with a weapon type and the distance to the target. Funnily enough you can also fire your sniper rifle from point blank range. Generally speaking, the more damage a weapon does, the more AP it requires. You will also have to reload at times, which also costs AP and potentially your whole move. Some weapons also offer other modes of fire. Automatic weapons have a burst fire mode, which costs lots of AP and wastes lots of ammo and should only be used on close targets, but can kill targets quickly and also hurt other enemies nearby. Speaking of ammo. Every weapon in the game uses a different type of ammo, so try to specialise on 1 or 2 weapons, otherwise you will just be carrying around lots of additional ammo, which takes up weight.\n\nIf you want to and find one you can also hire a companion...you should ♥♥♥♥ing do that. I can't imagine how to win the game without one. Tycho for example has loads of HPs and can fire almost any weapon. Be aware though that there is friendly fire in the game and the friendly AI cannot be controlled or given any orders. They will act on their own and they're ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, so don't stand in the way and try to keep them alive. It doens't help that you can't see their HPs...you can give the AI weapons and they will use whatever they deem best from their inventory.\n\nMovement and menus are a pain for modern days to be honest. Combat is "ok", but it just has this "feel" to it that makes it great somehow.\n\nOverall I like the game, though the story in general isn't very good imho. It's the individual people and missions that make this one entertaining.\n\nThere is no difficulty setting I think, so I would urge you to read some guides on what to do and how to even play the game, because there is no tutorial.","June 22, 2015","true","18.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When I first bought it about a year ago, being a fan of 3 and New Vegas, I thought "Oh this is fun." Then never played it again. Yesterday after seeing Fallout 4 be announced I decided I owed it to myself to play this game. About an hour in, I was hooked. For a simple looking game, it has very good combat and awesome quests.

They were extremely fun post apocalyptic games. The enviroment, music, quests, creatures, retro futuristic feel, you get the point. But if you play the classic fallout, you will find the fun, awesome post apocalyptic feel just like in fallout 3 & new vegas.\n\nThe story in fallout 1 is quite simple, but still very interesting. Your vault's water purification chip has  broken, and the overseer of your vault sends you to find a new water chip from a nearby vault. Of course, things dont exactly go as planned, but i dont want to spoil the story much.\n\nWhen you start a new game, you can customize your own character, or pick an arleady created one. After that, you start just outside your vault, ready to begin your adventure with a pistol that only has a handful of rounds, combat knife and couple of stimpaks. The atmosphere immediatley has the apocalyptic feel in it. The enviroment is open and quite detailed and the characters and quests you encounter are really memorable.\n\nI absolutely loved the locations in fallout 1.  From the large trading city called The Hub where you can buy or sell supplies, to the city of Necropolis that is populated by ghouls. There are more very interesting locations in fallout 1 that you'll love to explore.\n\nHowever the world of fallout 1 is not as open as in fallout 3. You can't just walk across the world map. You can only fast travel to locations on the world map. When stepping on the exit grid in any area, you will enter the world map. When you fast travel, there's a change you'll get random encounters, sometimes you'll just encounter normal folk passing by or enemies such as groups of super mutants and radscorpions that you have to fight. Speaking of combat...\n\nThe combat in fallout 1 is turn based. Fallout 1 uses an action point system where you have a limited amount of action points that you can spend to attack enemies, move around, switch weapons or look at your backpack. Once these points run out, The enemy gets the turn. Like in fallout 3, you can choose your primary combat style. There are 5 combat styles that are unarmed, melee weapons, guns, big guns and energy weapons. And i was actually surprised on how many guns there are in this game.  And there are alot.\n\nOverall, fallout 1 is a fantastic game that i highly recommend fallout fans to play. 10/10\n\n\n","June 9, 2015","true","28.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unlike those, the original Fallout is an isometric (not exactly, but whatever) and turn based RPG.\nThe main theme, concept and overall design are also shared with the other Fallout games.\nYou can still interact with every NPC, either by talking to them, bartering, stealing from them or just slaughtering them however you please. Watch out though, you'll easily die if you go up against enemies much better equipped than you or if you're significantly outnumbered.\nYou can also explore and interact with objects such as lockers, dresses, desks, etc... and search for various loot.\nMost (if not all) of the chems like Stimpaks and Psychos are here too, along with weapons from pistols and rifles, to miniguns and energy weapons. The armor is slightly different, but you have Mad Max's leather jacket and Power Armor, so nothing to complain about there.\nYou have companions that will follow you around and help in combat, like good ol' Dogmeat.\nThe way you navigate around the map is a bit different though. The wasteland isn't just one huge map. If you want to travel to other cities/areas (there's 13 different locations, if I'm not mistaken) you leave the one you're at and a map comes up. From there, you choose where to go and all you do is watch a cute little map marker (you) move towards the destination, unless you encounter something (like raiders, mutants, a corpse to loot, etc..) or you deliberately stop.\n\nThe leveling system is pretty much the same, where you allocate SPECIAL points and choose 2 perks at the begining  of the game and gain experience to level up. You can then level up your skills (which I also think are the same from Fallout 3 & NV) and earn a perk every few levels.\n\nOne thing that's noticeably different however, is the way you make use of your skills. If you want to, for example, pick a lock, you'll have to go your Skilldex and select the skill you want to use (in this case, the Lockpick skill) and then you click on the object you want to use the skill on (the lock). Other skills also work like this, where you select the skill then the target to use the skill on. Except for Sneak, which you just click to start sneaking and that's it.\n\nSo yeah, to sum it up, if you're a Fallout fan you should definitely check this one out, even if just for the lore.\nIf you're new to the series, you're better off picking up 3 or NV first.\n\nSide-note: This comes from a teenager who played Fallout 3 and New Vegas before this one, so there's no nostalgia involved here.","June 22, 2015","true","19.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you're a fan of Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas, you need to play Fallout & Fallout 2. If you're a fan of RPGs, you need to play Fallout, if you're a fan of original, immersive, interesting, and amusing games with interesting characters, quests, worlds, and items, you need to play Fallout.\n\nThe biggest complaint I hear people give Fallout and Fallout 2 is that they're "outdated" and that they've aged terribly, when this simply isn't the case. And what's worse, is that I hear this from people who supposedly claim to be HUGE Fallout fans. Fallout: New Vegas is my favorite Fallout game becuase it combines the skillful writing, RPG elements, and interesting characters and places from Fallout and Fallout 2, AND the first/third-person 3D open-world that I am used to, but even then I'm still able to turn off my FPS fanboy goggles for a little while to play an Isometric turn-based RPG because I love Fallout. I just really can't understand, if you really love Fallout, how any of the supposedly "outdated" elements of the original two games can hinder you from enjoying them, grow a pair and play them, It's not that difficult.\n\nCompared to Fallout 2, Fallout is probably a little lacking, as Fallout 2 practically improves in every single aspect of the game, a larger game world with more quests, more people to meet and more places to explore, however, the only thing FO2 doesn't really improve upon was the somewhat "serious" tone in the original, as Fallout 2 makes Fallout look like Heavy Rain in comparison. Although I myself prefer Fallout 2 for the reasons listed above, the original is still one of the greatest RPGs of all time, and of course, the forerunner for the complete Fallout series, which, for good or bad, is still going strong today. Also, don't give Ian the SMG.\n\nR.I.P. Ian, died while rescuing Tandi from the Raiders.\n\nR.I.P. Tycho, died while cleansing the Deathclaws from the Warehouse.\n\nR.I.P. Dogmeat, died while eradicating the Super Mutants from the Watershed.\n\nR.I.P. Katja, died while fighting the Super Mutants in the LA Vault.\n\nPS, game can actually run on Windows 7, *cough* Fallout 3 *cough*","June 27, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ameriken/recommended/38400/","ameriken","Ken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ameriken/","511 products in account","Released back in 1997, Fallout is still one of my favourite RPG's ever made. A spiritual successor to Wasteland with heavy influences from the 1981 movie Mad Max, this is a true blue, old school CRPG, no kiddies allowed. Don't expect any level of hand holding here. You're meant to explore, investigate, and actually think about what you do. Dialogue has meaning, and if you say or do the wrong thing, you might just ♥♥♥♥ someone off so bad you'll be screwed out of a quest forever. The combat is simple, yet deep enough to be engaging. Battles are turn-based, with action points determining how much you can do each turn. Most of the combat is driven by some heavy dice roll ♥♥♥♥, so expect to be screwed over by a bad critical hit and lose all of your health in a single turn, when previous attack dealt zero damage.\n\nMost of the map is empty space. Instead of walking everywhere, you travel on a world map to locations of interest, wherein the real ♥♥♥♥ happens. Ranging from small settlements to the ruined remains of ancient cities, these locations are teeming with mysteries to unravel, choices to make, people to meet, items to loot, and a bunch of people to murder, if you're feeling sadistic. Quests often involve multiple outcomes, with several offering the choice between two opposing sides. Whether you're a ruthless mercenary willing to take on any job, a generous saviour, or an evil monster, this game accommodates you, allowing you to approach the game any way you see fit.\n\nThe game's SPECIAL system offers a surprising amount of depth in character creation. Will you be a gun-toting wanderer who solves problems with his guns, or a smooth-talking snake who solves problems without ever resorting to violence? How about a strongman who smashes his foes with a sledgehammer but is so stupid he can't even carry a conversation with people? Yes, you can do that. No matter which perks you pick or what skills you invest in, you're character will always end up with a different set of strengths and weaknesses. With these systems, the player is given a great deal of options that allow them to fine-tune their character, creating a vastly unique playthrough each time.\n\nThe story, characters, and setting are all iconic at this point. Though much of its aesthetic is derivative in some way, Fallout carved a unique personality of its own regardless. The narrative is nothing too complicated, and yet it's well-written and impactful at the same time, leading up to one of the best endings in RPG history. There's only three quests in the main plot lines, but these are long involving journeys that will take you all across post-apocalyptic Southern California. As you go from town to town, new quests, jobs, and side activities will open up, which can ultimately serve your primary objectives as well. Know that there is a finite end to the content, however. Though there's a lot to see and do (my first playthrough clocked in at about sixty hours), the game ends once you've beaten the main quest, and outside of that, you can't explore every nook and cranny like you can in Fallout: New Vegas. There's a limit to just how much you can do, but I feel this adds more to the experience, as it lends meaning to your actions. Don't expect to get every skill to a hundred and unlock every perk in a single playthrough.\n\nAs a game that came out in the late nineties, there are definitely some issues. First, there are major graphical bugs which can be fixed, but may persist nonetheless in more benign forms, which is to be expected of a game that's almost seventeen years old. Then there's some other annoying nitpicks, like unintuitive UI that feels clunky and the odd limitation like not being able to move more than 999 bottle caps at a time when bartering. The AI can be absolute garbage at times, too. Let's put it this way. There were times when I felt grateful that one of my followers was standing in a corner and not fighting, because that means he couldn't shoot me in the back. Without the ability to control your party, things can get pretty frustrating later in the game, when you're rolling with a huge posse to beat the final boss. Hint: save often, and in many slots.\n\nSo, would I reccomend this game? That depends. Are you looking for an old school CRPG with deep combat and meaningful choices and character growth? If so, then I'll be damned if you can find a better game than Fallout.","June 12, 2014","true","69.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Since then I purchased copies on GoG.com and Steam.\n\nFallout is the standard by which every other entry in the franchise should be judged. It is the more focused, balanced, thematically coherent Fallout experience available and the only one released with main designers Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky and Jason Anderson still on board.\n\nBy today's standards the game still hold up well even without fan patches and resolution mods, which are still strongly recommended. The engine and interface does show its age and the sequel, Fallout 2, improves a few things here and there. But the turn-based system and top down camera are not products of their times. First person view and real time combat are not "modern". Changing the former for the latter doesn't constitute an improvement, but a complete change of direction.\n\nThis kind of game wasn't made that way due to technical limitations. Bethesda released its first Elder Scrolls game in 1994, the year Tim Cain started working on what would become Fallout. No, the intention was to make a computer rpg that felt like playing a pen & paper role playing game. It wasn't about player skills, but player choices. The perspective is from someone playing Dongeons & Dragons, Shadowrun or (more appropriately) GURPS, seeing the world through the maps and descriptions provided by the game master and, ultimately, interpreted by the player's imagination.\n\nIt isn't the most popular perspective but a legitimate one nonetheless, which suits computer rpgs like a glove. This is how Fallout was meant to be played and, frankly, that's how it should have stayed.","September 28, 2012","true","37.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ameriken/recommended/38400/","ameriken","Ken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ameriken/","511 products in account","Released back in 1997, Fallout is still one of my favourite RPG's ever made. A spiritual successor to Wasteland with heavy influences from the 1981 movie Mad Max, this is a true blue, old school CRPG, no kiddies allowed. Don't expect any level of hand holding here. You're meant to explore, investigate, and actually think about what you do. Dialogue has meaning, and if you say or do the wrong thing, you might just ♥♥♥♥ someone off so bad you'll be screwed out of a quest forever. The combat is simple, yet deep enough to be engaging. Battles are turn-based, with action points determining how much you can do each turn. Most of the combat is driven by some heavy dice roll ♥♥♥♥, so expect to be screwed over by a bad critical hit and lose all of your health in a single turn, when previous attack dealt zero damage.\n\nMost of the map is empty space. Instead of walking everywhere, you travel on a world map to locations of interest, wherein the real ♥♥♥♥ happens. Ranging from small settlements to the ruined remains of ancient cities, these locations are teeming with mysteries to unravel, choices to make, people to meet, items to loot, and a bunch of people to murder, if you're feeling sadistic. Quests often involve multiple outcomes, with several offering the choice between two opposing sides. Whether you're a ruthless mercenary willing to take on any job, a generous saviour, or an evil monster, this game accommodates you, allowing you to approach the game any way you see fit.\n\nThe game's SPECIAL system offers a surprising amount of depth in character creation. Will you be a gun-toting wanderer who solves problems with his guns, or a smooth-talking snake who solves problems without ever resorting to violence? How about a strongman who smashes his foes with a sledgehammer but is so stupid he can't even carry a conversation with people? Yes, you can do that. No matter which perks you pick or what skills you invest in, you're character will always end up with a different set of strengths and weaknesses. With these systems, the player is given a great deal of options that allow them to fine-tune their character, creating a vastly unique playthrough each time.\n\nThe story, characters, and setting are all iconic at this point. Though much of its aesthetic is derivative in some way, Fallout carved a unique personality of its own regardless. The narrative is nothing too complicated, and yet it's well-written and impactful at the same time, leading up to one of the best endings in RPG history. There's only three quests in the main plot lines, but these are long involving journeys that will take you all across post-apocalyptic Southern California. As you go from town to town, new quests, jobs, and side activities will open up, which can ultimately serve your primary objectives as well. Know that there is a finite end to the content, however. Though there's a lot to see and do (my first playthrough clocked in at about sixty hours), the game ends once you've beaten the main quest, and outside of that, you can't explore every nook and cranny like you can in Fallout: New Vegas. There's a limit to just how much you can do, but I feel this adds more to the experience, as it lends meaning to your actions. Don't expect to get every skill to a hundred and unlock every perk in a single playthrough.\n\nAs a game that came out in the late nineties, there are definitely some issues. First, there are major graphical bugs which can be fixed, but may persist nonetheless in more benign forms, which is to be expected of a game that's almost seventeen years old. Then there's some other annoying nitpicks, like unintuitive UI that feels clunky and the odd limitation like not being able to move more than 999 bottle caps at a time when bartering. The AI can be absolute garbage at times, too. Let's put it this way. There were times when I felt grateful that one of my followers was standing in a corner and not fighting, because that means he couldn't shoot me in the back. Without the ability to control your party, things can get pretty frustrating later in the game, when you're rolling with a huge posse to beat the final boss. Hint: save often, and in many slots.\n\nSo, would I reccomend this game? That depends. Are you looking for an old school CRPG with deep combat and meaningful choices and character growth? If so, then I'll be damned if you can find a better game than Fallout.","June 12, 2014","true","69.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It spans the entireity of the Mojave Dersert-region... more precisely, the deserts of the California and Nevada regions. You begin as a Lone Wanderer set upon a quest to restore your Vault-Tek™ Vault's water chip; the sole thing that purifies the disease-ridden, irradiated waters of the surface world so that your vault's inhabitants will have fresh water to drink. It having broken down, you're sent out to find a new one. Along the way, you'll encounter many strange people... and many deadly enemies, not-so interesting companions... but companions none-the-less.\n\n=--------PROGRESSIVE POINTS----------=\n*Elder to the first US-based RPGs\n*Turn-based (You are free to plan your next move, it could be your last!)\n*Compatability/Optimized for Windows 7+ Operating Systems\n*Compatability/Still contains the original version for 98/XP-based Operating Systems\n*Brutal difficulty (Just how you remember it)\n\n=--------CONTRARY POINTS-------------=\n*Ancient graphical detail\n*Linear storyline\n*Limited range of weaponry/gear\n*Brutal difficulty (No forgiveness for mistakes)\n*Clunky UI (For what it was back in the day, hasn't aged well IMHO)\n\n=--------PERSONAL GAME RESULTS-------=\nI give this game a 8/10\nI give this game a [LEGENDARY™ MOLE RAT STEW]","October 30, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's ancient... very old. Despite that however, Bethesda still shows love to this timeless classic created by Fallout's original makers; Interplay. This is the one that started them all. It hasn't aged well as far as graphics and gameplay goes, but it's true to the RPG format, and one of the original US Turn-based RPGs from the 90s era. It spans the entireity of the Mojave Dersert-region... more precisely, the deserts of the California and Nevada regions. You begin as a Lone Wanderer set upon a quest to restore your Vault-Tek™ Vault's water chip; the sole thing that purifies the disease-ridden, irradiated waters of the surface world so that your vault's inhabitants will have fresh water to drink. It having broken down, you're sent out to find a new one. Along the way, you'll encounter many strange people... and many deadly enemies, not-so interesting companions... but companions none-the-less.\n\n=--------PROGRESSIVE POINTS----------=\n*Elder to the first US-based RPGs\n*Turn-based (You are free to plan your next move, it could be your last!)\n*Compatability/Optimized for Windows 7+ Operating Systems\n*Compatability/Still contains the original version for 98/XP-based Operating Systems\n*Brutal difficulty (Just how you remember it)\n\n=--------CONTRARY POINTS-------------=\n*Ancient graphical detail\n*Linear storyline\n*Limited range of weaponry/gear\n*Brutal difficulty (No forgiveness for mistakes)\n*Clunky UI (For what it was back in the day, hasn't aged well IMHO)\n\n=--------PERSONAL GAME RESULTS-------=\nI give this game a 8/10\nI give this game a [LEGENDARY™ MOLE RAT STEW]","October 30, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I spent many hours playing this game and I admit I needed a walkthrough as the difficulty of this game is based on you have a limited number of days, based on the storyline.\n\nThe Story: For those who don't know, you start out as a vault dweller whose parents took shelter in vault 13 along with many others to avoid the coming nucular missiles at the height of World War 3. The residents are meant to stay in the vault until such a time as the raditation levels have gone down low enough as to not be a issue, however your vault's water chip has broken. The main source of drinking water based on a recycling system in the vault. As they have no other option, they need to send out one of the residents and you volunteer to enter a world that has completely changed since your ancestors walked the surface during the war and find a new water chip as the Overseer knows of a nearby vault (Vault 15) which may have a spare chip to use.\n\nThe combat system is turn-based and on a invisible hex-grid. It is also based on Action Points and in combat uses what was called the VATS system where you can aim for a specific point on the creature, but if you were to take the trait that lets you shoot more often (forgot it's name) you will be unable to do accurate aiming. It's a old-school PC RPG where your decisions are totally up to you and ethics are optional in how you get the waterchip or where from. With multiple endings and detailed tellings of what happened to the places you visited, after you left leaves the game open for many multiple play throughts  for endless gameplay and always discover new things and easter eggs such as "the holy hand grenade." and other references too numerous to count.\n\nA brilliant game and well worth a purchas if you are after a old-school RPG, but as it is so old and not altered for modern systems (unlike on GoG) you will need to look up how to run the game without weird graphical glitches.","February 10, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can beat this game in 9 minutes 17 seconds (literally, speedrun is on youtube somewhere) or in average 20 hours without getting bored for 1 second.

Lots of freedom, likeable characters, an intriguing backstory, a main quest you can straight-up fail, some of the greatest endings in any game, and a gorgeous dark-ambient soundtrack.\n\nOn the down side, the interface is clunky and slow, especially inventory. NPC sidekicks can be frustrating to work with and will often harm you or each other. (It's not nearly as bad as some clumsy players will tell you it is.) And a few quests can hinge on pixel hunting - not intentionally, but simply because items can be hard to spot against the dithery backgrounds.\n\nBe advised that all combat in this game is turn-based. It's fun, but it's NOT optional like you see in Fallout 3 and New Vegas. You will take turns spending action points on a hex grid, every fight. Fallout is a slow RPG. It is not by any definition an action game.\n\nHighest possible recommendation.","August 6, 2012","true","8.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

The atmosphere of Fallout is amazing. It's one of the few games I feel that has gotten its atmosphere down right, combining a dangerous and barren post-apocalyptia with a retro 1950s undertone, and maintains a great balance between feeling ridiculous and serious. The story isn't anything to write home about, but it's an effective motivating force for the game. With that in mind, know that if you pick up Fallout, do NOT consult any walkthrough or wiki when playing it because, trust me, it'll spoil the fun. Fallout is the type of RPG that's made a whole lot better when you live with your consequences and aren't certain about where the story will take you.\n\nAs for the customization, Fallout has it in plentiful supply and I'm not just refering to the moral choices available to you. Rather, it's the character customization which is some of the best. Between getting to specialize in a wide variety of weapon types to being able to having your intelligence level effect your choices in the game (Anything below an Intelligence of 4 makes you a bumbling idiot, and this is reflected in game by your dialogue options which are limited to "me have trouble thinking") there's a great amount of replayability to this game.\n\nHowever, while I recommend Fallout it does come with a bundle of bugs, some of which have the potential to be game breaking such as being trapped in a corner by an unmovable companion NPC. Because of this, I recommend you mod it. My personal recommendation is called "Fallout FIXT" by Sduibek. It's a great megamod which fixes a lot of problems, and is VERY customizable allowing you to choose between general bug fixes and improvements, or changing the feel of the game entirely. It's a great download.\n\nAnyway, Fallout is a fantastic (though not a perfect) game. I highly recommend it, ESPECIALLY if you can bag it for cheap!","December 2, 2013","true","28.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you have no knowledge of the game, don't bother throwing a cent at it.\nLenght: Unknown. At least a week. Probably more.\n\nFallout is an old classic. If you've played fallout 3 or New Vegas and taken an interest in the series and want to try this, I seriously recommend watching a few youtube vids first, as the game is very old. It's not exactly easy to adjust to a game this dated.\n\nThat said, even on windows 7, it plays without error.\n\nThe game will probably remind a lot of people, initially of the more recent fallout games. They seem do have done a great job of passing on the setting. Bear in mind that this is turn-based combat, and top-down view and isometric. It's truly an oldie.\n\nThe game is crafted with a lot of detail in mind. Each map allows for every single item to be examined, and unlike in more recent RPG's in general, you will not be told when to use skills. There is no tutorial (to my knowledge) but the game isn't super hard to figure out, and if it becomes tricky there are guides on the internet.\n\nIt's a good holiday project, but hardly a treat for a gamer who seeks a visual challenge and revolutionary gameplay. For gamers interested in gaming history or people in general who can stand playing old games, you will have a chance to experience a rolepalying game that dates to the time when people really knew how to craft a world with eye for detail.\n\nPersonally I tried fallout when I was a child, having barely a clue what I was doing. I've since stumbled on it again and again with friends who time and time again referred to it as a classic.

It can be genuinely fun, but you have to be willing to overlook a few problems.\n\nFor one, non-violent character builds (i.e. focus on skills like sneak, speech, science, etc) are pretty much impossible to play for several reasons. A) There are random encounters in this game, which you will get constantly while fast traeveling. Unless you're really, really, lucky, you will get murdered by raiders and scorpions over and over again. B) You will miss out on XP through combat, which will make you way too low level.\n\nSecondly, most skills in this game are uneccessary or plainly useless.\n\nIn order to have fun, I recomend you play the following character. Choose gifted and fast shot as traits, lockpick, science, and small guns as tag skills. Then go with 2 cha, 4 int, 4 str, 10 end, 10 agility, 10 per, and 5 luck. Trust me, just do it.\n\nIt kind of feels like a let down in that you don't get a lot of freedom to do what you want. This game is very combat-oriented.\n\nAnother problem is the graphics. It personally didn't bother me, but I know it can upset some people. If that's important to you, maybe don't play it.\n\nLastly, the game is arbitrarily hard. The first time I saw a mutant, I got blasted to bits in one hit. Make  sure to save often and I recomend playing on easy, because Fallout enemies are super unfair.\n\nHowever, don't let that stop you from enjoying it. There are many good things about it also.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed was the simple fact that no other franchise really makes post-apocalytpic RPGs. The enemies look all mad max style, how cool is that? The setting is really cool, and frankly, underused. I've always maintained that interesting settings *make* RPGs.\n\nThe story of Fallout is actually pretty interesting, even if it is rather bare-bones.\n\nI was also really impressed by the goal of Fallout: you have only 150 days to get a water chip, which your vault needs. You're on your own and you have to figure out where it is quickly. It's almost like a sleuth or detective RPG.\n\nIf you feel like the good outwieghs the bad, you should try it. It's not a perfect game and I probably wouldn't finish it gain, but it's a unique experience.","June 27, 2014","true","20.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The storyline you follow is dull, although the background information is really interesting, with the end-of-the-world scenario that kicked it all off in pretty much every game since. be prepared though, this information is pretty much shoved in your face every time you talk to anyone. They respond to a two word question with a five hundered word essay, and you have to read it all to make sense of what's going on.\n\nThe combat is what I thought the Fallout series would excel at, but I was wrong. enemies surround you far too quickly, you have to use 'action points' like a turn based strategy, in fact that's what the combat is, and I find it a hard concept to master.\n\nOverall this game is great for its story and lore but not so strong with its combat and mechanics in the modern era. Recommended if you can put up with the flaws of older titles.","June 13, 2014","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Back then I was pretty young and didn't have exactly a firm grasp of reality and the seriousness of Fallout.\n\nNow, upon purchasing the classic pack, I delved back into the world of Fallout, and after having some memories flood back and some trials and errors, I once again (without help this time) beat Fallout, I survived, I learned, I made decisions that made me question my humanity as a whole, thank god for the comic relief in game otherwise I would've gotten depressed real fast! Now that the compliments are outta the way, let me begin by saying this a game befitting anyone's game library.\n\nFallout, as a whole, makes you question and discover yourself (Get ready for group therapy session!), its amazing locales and set-up make it a unique game to play, I could actually spend hours trying to figure out what and where I find the Red Ryder LE BB Gun (Special Encounter). Beautifully detailed yet desolate and unforgiving landscapes and settlements make for a great experience, mechanics are smooth and simple, once you figure them out of course.\nI was pretty much thrown into the game without prior knowledge of the controls or how combat and interaction function, once I remembered some bits and pieces and tried different things, it was simple.\n\nA colorful cast of characters that antagonizes and emphasises on a great deal of comical and serious matters, each one, be it a "talking head" or just a regular NPC, will have you wonder "Do I join this group? Do I shoot this guy? Why does the man keep screaming about cheese? Should I prevent or stay out of this fight that possibly decides the outcome of an entire game?"\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I tried my best to explain what Fallout entails, what it does, how it makes me feel, and how much I love it. But I sadly cannot put into full detail how amazing Fallout is.\n\nAll I can say is Fallout is like a wonderful sight of a game, a whole lot of what-ifs, and lovely interaction.\n\nThough humanity may have blown itself up, that is not the end of the story, because war...

It's kind of a shame they never made any sequels to this game, but maybe that's for the best. I'm sure that if Fallout became an ongoing series, then by now, it'd be in the hands of a AAA publisher who'd be busy gutting the series one game at a time by replacing the story and dialogue with half-realized trendy gameplay elements, retconning the original game fifty times with every new installment, and leeching off unpaid work by the modding community while simultaneously relying on them to make the games playable to begin with.

I assumed that due to it's age and the companies behind it, that it would be pretty bad and boring, but I was very wrong. This game is full of a fair amount of quests that all have good story to them. The visuals are fine when the HD patch is applied. There is lack of audio in the game aside from the odd sound effect and combat related sounds such as gunshot. The game also has fairly slow paced gameplay and you'd have to be patient to deal with it at times. The game has turn-based combat using a targeting system called "V.A.T.S." that works on percentages. The games RPG elements are detailed with many perks and skills to train as well as using speech options that effect how the game plays out.\nIf you're a fan of post-apocalyptic setting, don't mind the dated graphics and slow paced gameplay.

Unfortunately, Black Isle Studios didn't have the knack to implement an abundance of voice actors. Truth be told there are only a handful of them in the entire game. Everything else is good old fashion dialogue. Sure, you might here me and other people complain about this. But let's just say, for the shake of this review. I get over the fact the game only has a limited amount of voice actors until Fallout 3. The only major problem I've encountered thus far with Fallout 1 through 2 (including Fallout Tactics) is the despicable combat system. I mean this combat system sucks.. I'm talking atari style combat.. A friendly individual fires first, then a hostile target fires second. It essentially goes back and fourth until one or the other is dead. This is extremely unrealistic, and truthfully. I don't believe there was any excuse for this whatsoever. Take my word for it, I'm a huge fan of the Fallout series; but this is just ridiculous. In closing this message, I want to add the story is of course outstanding. I hope one day they'll consider doing a remastered version of both Fallout 1 and Fallout 2.

Oh and some pretty tough game play (at least for me).  I picked it up simply for storyline and slight nostalgia.  Which is what I think most players picked it up for.  To complete the set and get that little bit of Lore you always wondered about.\n\nSeriously, buy this game only if you want to experience the classics.  It's like buying Final Fantasy 1 cause you enjoyed 10 so much that you want to know the first game better.  It's a completely different beast but worth experiencing even if you never finish it.

Its really difference and theirs a learning curve to it.\n\nThis game is old and outdated - this is true no argument about that. So it will affect my final score.\n\nMy Score system: 10/10 is a perect, 5/10 is average, and 0/10 Horrible.\n\nThis game is a 7/10, a good game. It should be played if your a fallout fan and have never touched this old cRPG classic.\n","December 18, 2013","true","26.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Glover-/recommended/38400/","Glover-","Glover","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Glover-/","483 products in account","This game came out in 1997 and it surprisingly holds up to this day. I was afraid I wouldn't like it because of how old it was and that I had played Fallout 3 and New Vegas first but I was completely wrong. It's basically the same as Fallout 3 and NV but isometric.\n\nThe classic Fallout charm is present in this game with a main story and a few side quests. Though the game seems kinda basic in some areas a lot of the game seems a lot deeper and more indepth than a lot of Modern RPG's. At the time I can imagine this was quite revolutionary setting the standard for RPG's in general.\n\nOnly once or twice I got fustrated at the game, not due to the lack of direction but due to the logic I was using to solve a problem not working even though I felt like it should. However it turned out the thing I was doing you were actually meant to do later on but I originally didn't try it again until I looked up I was doing it correctly just in the wrong area. Oh well.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the lack of direction is a big thing in this game. The first quest is "Find the water chip. Here is a place it MIGHT be." and that's it. It's very satisfying to complete quests because of this as you need to ask around and gather information to solve the quests for yourself.\n\nMy only complaint with the game is that the combat is unforgiving and can be fustrating at times as you can get instakilled just because of a random critical hit. The accuracy is also unforgiving at times as well especially in skills that you haven' trained as much. It's not that it's stupid it's far too unforgiving for what it is.\n\nThe bottom line:\nIf you enjoyed the other Fallout games (including 3 and NV) you will like this one.","June 10, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However since Bethesda has updated the game they have ruined it. They only applied a well known resolution patch which has been avaiable for years on the net to increase the resolution to fit most modern screens. However no improvemnt or bug fixes have been made. I also would like to point out that the resoution is horrible. There is no HD patch upgrade like in many other games from other developers like the stronghold HD series which is a great patch. But again like always Bethesda has dropped the ball in our belived Fallout series. If you want this game find an older version if you can.

After hearing around the whole internet that this game was definetly better than Fallout 3 and on, I decided to buy it. I was sure that the game would have some pretty bad graphics and what not, but personally I don't mind old games and bad graphix at all. What a game should have, its value. A game with a good story, a good gameplay. and a good fluidity , it's a good game. Fallout 1 only gets the story characteristic right. Yes, the story is amaing, and t gets the feeling and atmosphere right. It was amazing to get inmersed into the wasteland for the first time, but, that's about it. Honestly, even modern Fallouts get this right. The problem with this game is the gameplay, and the pacing. My god.\nThe gameplay is horrible. It is so slow, and ridiclous, that it makes it boring. It's basicaly a point and click battle system, with enemies that deal ridiculous damage and never miss, while you are too weak and are constantly missing.   It never made me feel good, like an RPG usually does, about getting stronger with EXP., and then tackling the stronger enemies and achieving victories. Why? cause, and this is the best part, at the beginning of the game, you have a stupid time limit. You can't go around exploring the wasteland and getting stronger at your own pace! Nope. You need to hurry and finish part of the main quest with as little moves as possible, so you don't get a game over. If you are like me and you don't like looking up things at google to solve games, then you'll probably have to start over from scratch more than once to figure out what to do to solve this problem. It's just not fun. Anybody that likes this game is because they feel nostalgia. That's it. The game itsef is garbage, quite honestly. Every single character is shallow, except for the final boss, and the side-quest are crap. If you lived in the 80's and 90's this game would've been mind blowing. Today, it's crap.","November 21, 2015","false","5.6"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","1"

It took me a whole 10 minutes to just leave the cave! there is no real help or objective other than a sticky note on your pip boy. Also every battle was very boring (slow) or too hard, it was nearly impossable to shoot something and monsters do WAY too much damage! (to be fair you're only given so much health in the beginning)  Hell elderscroll's "arena" played smoother than fallout 1...

The actual game itself leaves a lot to be desired, as the gameplay and story are paper thin.  Most perks and skills are useless in the game, so you'll likely need to read up on how to build your character before you begin playing, so as to not put yourself at a major disadvantage at the onset.  This is extremely dissapointing for an RPG game, as it forces you to play in a certain way, not the way you want to play.  The world is small, and main baddies (super mutants), play almost no role in the game, save one instance, until the finale.  The controls take a few hours to get used to, but even after a day of playing, you may still be unsure how to approach certain quests and objectives presented within the game.  (You need to "use" a radio to disable the forcefields at the military base, wah?, and good luck figuring that out without using google.)\n\nThere's little reason to explore quests on the side, some are only initiated with very specific dialouge (despite it seeming as though you've reached an agreement), and some quests are hinted at but don't even exist at all!  The rewards that come from completing the various quests are useless unless there's some type of loot you'll find along the way.  Don't bother saving up money to purchase the various in game weapons, as you'll find all the ammo and weaponry you need along the way.  There are only a few talking heads in the game, but other than the Mutant at the military base and the "Master" during the end-game, the characters are bland, boring, and offer little in the way of interesting information or background.  All of this takes away from the games interesting premise that paved the way for much better Fallout sequels.   Towards the end of the game, I finally realized that there's little meaningful dialogue and reason to explore the map and grinded through it, only to have the game crash at the end.\n\nGood aspects of the game include the excellent voice acting (despite most of it being shallow), and a few interesting story bits provided by the two meaningful characters.  The combat can also be fun in final stages of the game, but boring at the beggining and middle portions.  Overall the atmosphere and originality of the game and its sequels makes the games existence seem worthwhile.  However, as a standalone game it has little redeeming qualities, and at the insanely rip-off price of $10, you're better off watching the cutscenes on Youtube and passing on this so call "classic".","August 15, 2014","false","21.6"," 14 of 40 people (35%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","35","14","40","2","0"

If you genuinely think this is a 10/10 game you must have been 10 years old when you last played this. Nostalgia has to be the only cure for this.\n\nAs I'm writing this I just finally ragequit after playing an 9 hour session, in the middle of which I had to start a new character because I found out that I had basically just lost the game there and there was no way to return. The reason I just ragequit is that pretty much the same thing happened again. I went into an area from which I could not get out alive. Of course I only had one save because I couldn't ever have expected ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like this.\n\nThe game forces you to save every 5 seconds because you never know when YOU are going to ♥♥♥♥ YOURSELF over by choosing one of the wrong answers in some conversation (even though it might be a completely normal thing to say).\nIf you fail to choose the "right" thing to say from the 4 or 5 dialogue options some NPCs will NEVER TALK TO YOU AGAIN. Their hatred for you burns with the heat of the sun because you asked how they were doing instead of if they had a job for you.\n\nThe NPCs also seem to ignore the stats that bind the player. They shoot you with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ starting pistols from a mile away and do damage you can only dream of doing yourself.\nOther than that the combat mechanics are pretty interesting and work well. You can plan your moves well and do some really nice tacticool stuff. It was really satisfying to clear out the Raider Camp but after meeting Super Mutants and finding out that they have infinite health I just didn't know what the hell I was supposed to do to get more levels.\n\nSome of the objectives were also almost impossible to find out for yourself. Sometimes there is a pixel-fine line between advancing to the next area and "nothing interesting happens". I only checked a guide once to see what to do next and I am sure I would have been there for two hours and restarted the whole game after that if I didn't do it.\n\nMaybe it was all my fault and I'm really bad at video games. But damn this game isn't hard, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Mechanical difficulty is entirely different from what this game is.\n\nDon't buy this game if you want to find out about the Fallout story. Just go read it.\n\n","June 16, 2015","false","15.3"," 13 of 38 people (34%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","34","13","38","3","6"

I seriously had to force myself to keep playing the game, and if i hadnt paid for it, i would have already deinstalled it!\nAbout the reasons: The difficulty is extremely hard, as the hero is very weak, and hardly able to kill anything at the beginning. Be prepared to reload very often, as random encounters are usually much more than you could take, and as the leveling process is painfully slow!\nThen, as you would expect from such an old game, the graphic is terrible, and the game mechanics are outdated. Dont expect the comfort, complexity and polish of modern games. Without fanmods, this game is hardly playable at all, and even with, the game crashes constantly and lots of bugs remain.\nAnd finally, there is a time-limit for your mission, which causes a tough game to become stressy and annoying.\n\nPersonally, i cannot recommend this game at all!","July 30, 2014","false","6.0"," 14 of 42 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","14","42","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJZoom/recommended/38400/","RJZoom","RJ Zoom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJZoom/","138 products in account","Disclaimer: I have previously played Fallout 3 and enjoyed both the game and universe. That being said, I looked into the original games a bit before purchasing to see what type of gameplay it was.\n\nThe Basics:  This game has a top-down view with turn-based combat. The game came out in 1997, so the graphics are starting to show their age.\n\nMy Opinion: I didn't care for this game at all. There are two big things that ruined the game for me: poor direction and terrible combat.\nWhen it comes to quests, I would like some for of, "the main mission/quest is in this general direction." I want some idea of knowing how I can progress. I am not asking for the game to hold my hand. I actually don't care for games that hold my hand. However, I shouldn't have to look at a walkthrough to tell me where I have to go for the main story. It would be one thing if I didn't know where to find a side mission/quest. Sometimes people get lost in games, sure. You start out lost at the beginning of the game with no sense of direction in a cave.\nThe combat was the second issue I had. It's clunky and bland. Maybe I just didn't play far enough into the game, but it just felt sloppy and wasn't engaging. It didn't feel like I was able to do anything. You start off with all of your items, and weapons, in your bag. You have nothing equpped. Take a few steps forward and you are in your first battle. Now, almost every single game I have ever played has you start with a weapon equipped, or you fight to gain that first weapon. As I said, you have your first weapon, why the hell is it not equipped or tell you to check inventory? So after you either fail or realize, "oh hey, I have a ♥♥♥♥ing gun that nobody told me about," you finally equip it. Now you can fight rats and point blank range with a gun. You shoot, you miss. You shoot again, you miss again. Meanwhile, this rat is going to beat the hell out of you and you lose half of your health while shooting and outline of the rat around him.\n\nConclusion: This game isn't for me. The sloppy direction and combat are what drove me away. Maybe the game is too dated. Maybe if I had tried it a few years soon, I might have been able to enjoy it. The fact is that now I don't find the game enjoyable at all.\n\n3/10","June 8, 2015","false","1.3"," 10 of 34 people (29%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","29","10","34","3","4"

Since I played the newer games first I probably grew to expect fast paced combat in all the games, but instead you get slow, and I mean SLOW, turned based combat.\n\nThe action point system really annoys me as well, Ive got like a 9 out of 10 for agility or endurance (or whatever) in my stats which I expected, like in the newer games, would make me run faster and for longer but Ive got like 10 "action points" instead which I know sounds big and you think you might be able to do loads of stuff with them, but each 'action' takes about 3 or 4 points, so you end up only being able to do like 2 things per turn. Oh and by action, I mean: Walk around, look in inventory (which takes 3 action points by the way), shoot/attack something, look at something, or literally anything really. So when compared to the incredibly slow combat, with you maybe, (if your lucky) getting 2 shots, or attacks, on an enemy each turn, you get an even more slow and boring game.\n\nThe story isnt that great also. All you need to do is get a water chip or something so your told to go to another vault and find one, so then when you get there you're literally just told: "OH ITS NOT HERE, PROBABLY SOMEWHERE ELSE THEN". I got bored after that and just stopped.\n\nThe game makes me feel really tired, honestly about 30 minutes of gameplay and I need to quit otherwise I might fall asleep.\n\nI know that Im being harsh but because I grew with the newer generation Fallout games like Fallout 3 and New Vegas I felt really disappointed by this one. This is just my opinion by the way but if you do get bored quickly and if you hate slow gameplay then this is NOT the game for you.\n\nI give it about 4.5/10","July 21, 2014","false","2.9"," 13 of 44 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","13","44","0","5"

Set in a post apocalyptic world, Fallout starts out with you (the hero) leaving the safety of your underground village to search for a water purifier which is essential for the continued survival of your village.\nThe outer world has a similar feeling to the 'MAD MAX' movies without the cars. Through many towns you interact with seperate factions and gangs, often invoving your self in quests, or trying to avoid being killed!\nYou can design your own character or use a predesigned character. You have several statistics which combined with some 'characteristics' give you a list of percentile abilities (e.g. small gun 65% - meaning you have a 65% chance of hitting an enemy in normal conditions!).\nThe world is set out in several sections. Based on a vast grid, you have many wilderness boxes and several 'towns' such as Junktown etc. In the wilderness you can encounter travelling tradesmen or evil creatures out to get you.\nThe game is very intuitive allowing you to do most things with your mouse. The combat is particularly easy, aiming at an opponent gives you a pecentage chance of hitting. You can either shoot or try a different opponent. You often meet peole who will join your group, but be careful not to stand in front of them as they often manage to accidently hit you in combat!\nThe graphics and sound are very atmospheric adding a little excitement to the game. Although the plot is weak, I found the game to be very enjoyable with some neat touches here and there. This game is definately a must for most rpgers out there.","December 22, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can loot, kill, and do just about anything.  It is alot more forgiving than Fallout 2 but it isn't as long.  The story itself is unique and well paced.  I never felt while I was playing the game was taking too long.  I liked how you can find all the cool easter eggs that most companies don't ever put in their games now.

He had been trying for weeks to get me to play, I finally gave in a decided to try it and I LOVED IT! I went on a Fallout binge, often playing for 10 or more hours per day. Then I finished the game and moved on to New Vegas.\nRecently I decided I wanted to go back to the beginning and play the earlier games. I wasn't expecting very much, especially since it was made in 1997; but when I first started it I felt like it was a waste of money(even though I bought the bundle while it was on sale). After getting my butt kicked by Radscorpions and not knowing how to get better equipment I was about to give up, then I started goofing around and found out what I wanted to know.\nSo far I haven't progressed ver far in the main questline, but I have developed a new found respect for the original, in my opinion being better than the newer ones. The areas are quite large, the music is addicting,and the combat system is not as bad I though it to be.\nMy biggest challenge when I started playing was adjusting to the combat system. Since I started Fallout playing Fallout 3 it took some time to get used to the combat system in this game.

Character customization even in this early installment still gives you a lot of control over your character and their capabilities, and plot lines altered by players' decision give the player a sense of ownership over the outcomes. Games like this spark the fire that become today's RPG gaming. Turn-based game play involves a little more forethought in strategy than fans of modern games are used to, you find less quick reaction is useful and more preparation and anticipation of combat needs will save you.

Set in a post apocalyptic world, Fallout starts out with you (the hero) leaving the safety of your underground village to search for a water purifier which is essential for the continued survival of your village.\nThe outer world has a similar feeling to the 'MAD MAX' movies without the cars. Through many towns you interact with seperate factions and gangs, often invoving your self in quests, or trying to avoid being killed!\nYou can design your own character or use a predesigned character. You have several statistics which combined with some 'characteristics' give you a list of percentile abilities (e.g. small gun 65% - meaning you have a 65% chance of hitting an enemy in normal conditions!).\nThe world is set out in several sections. Based on a vast grid, you have many wilderness boxes and several 'towns' such as Junktown etc. In the wilderness you can encounter travelling tradesmen or evil creatures out to get you.\nThe game is very intuitive allowing you to do most things with your mouse. The combat is particularly easy, aiming at an opponent gives you a pecentage chance of hitting. You can either shoot or try a different opponent. You often meet peole who will join your group, but be careful not to stand in front of them as they often manage to accidently hit you in combat!\nThe graphics and sound are very atmospheric adding a little excitement to the game. Although the plot is weak, I found the game to be very enjoyable with some neat touches here and there. This game is definately a must for most rpgers out there.","December 22, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do NOT go into this game thinking you will automatically kick but, YOU WON'T.

Before going out, he peered his head into my room and left an Xbox 360 copy of Fallout 3 on my table for me to borrow. I was addicted. The start of the summer of 09' was spent wondering the DC ruins and soaking up everything that that insane game had to offer.\n\nA year later in 2010, New Vegas had came out. I ravenously guzzled it down within a month and was still hungry for more. For a massive history-buff like me, and all though it's set in the 2100's, the Fallout series offered a unique experience and had me totally engrossed in it's seemingly endless codex-like information and lore.\n\nSo, some time later it is payday December 2013. By now I am on Steam (albeit still a noob) and I am searching the store. I get home from a freezing night of Christmas shopping with the girlfriend, and I notice the 'Fallout Bundle' going for around £3. Was this real?\n\nAs soon as Fallout 1 had Installed I jumped on in.\n\nIt took a while to get used to the old turn taking system, but you have to be open minded. Playing game series backwards in age is going to be off putting so you have to try and enjoy it for what it is. Saying this though, I got bored (Guilty as charged) and didn't play it for about half a year. As much as it pains me to say this, I just lost my will to play it entirely from sheer boredom.\n\nInto the not-so-distant future and the Fallout crave had started to come back. I reinstalled F:aPNRPG and jumped on into a new game. This time round, I curbed my ego and instead of playing Fallout 1 like I played Fallout 3 and NV, I decided to take a completely different approach.\n\nI forced myself to remember, this game was made when I was fifteen months old. Times were different back then. So I dumped myself in the desk chair, grabbed a tall drink of cola and walked out into the Vault 13 Caves.\n\nI didn't look back, and what a game it was. A solid 10/10. A beautifully minimalist/simple and believable plot too. Try it for yourself.\n\nIf you are approaching this game from the future like I did, then be open minded. Only play it when you crave to. Otherwise you'll get bored and this gem will be missed out on.\n\nNext up, Fallout 2.","September 24, 2014","true","37.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He had been trying for weeks to get me to play, I finally gave in a decided to try it and I LOVED IT! I went on a Fallout binge, often playing for 10 or more hours per day. Then I finished the game and moved on to New Vegas.\nRecently I decided I wanted to go back to the beginning and play the earlier games. I wasn't expecting very much, especially since it was made in 1997; but when I first started it I felt like it was a waste of money(even though I bought the bundle while it was on sale). After getting my butt kicked by Radscorpions and not knowing how to get better equipment I was about to give up, then I started goofing around and found out what I wanted to know.\nSo far I haven't progressed ver far in the main questline, but I have developed a new found respect for the original, in my opinion being better than the newer ones. The areas are quite large, the music is addicting,and the combat system is not as bad I though it to be.\nMy biggest challenge when I started playing was adjusting to the combat system.

War never changes.\nA concept that has driven a younger self to delve into the depths of human history and indulge in the ages of humanities stife.\nFallout and its proceeding series has taken a Post- Nuclear apocalyptic outcome of humanity, peeking subsequently in the attitude, culture and design of 1950's United States of America...  on October 23, 2077 a final Nuclear showdown between the powerhouses of the world finally push the resource crippled Earth to its limits.\nThe aftermath that ensued is what caries the Fallout series...\n\n2161... 84 years after the grand conclusion to Man's pinacle.\n\nUnfotunately, the scarred earth was not left without it's demons looming. Pulling humanity ever downward or to one binding will or another.\n\nThis did not mean all was lost though... Emergent groups; once sealed away long ago before the world went silent still had a chance to re-inherit a land all but forsaken by it's previous masters.\n\nThe time had come for the those fortunate enough to hide away in sealed underground fortresses known as Vaults. These Vault Dwellers experienced a different form of life... Far from the raptured barren lands of the nuclear wasteland that was now the Americas.\n\nFallout will take you through the Western United States of America, your mission... Save the Vault, your objectives, retrieve a Water-purification chip  and return with any details of the land.\n\nWith the goal established you are pushed onto a desert frontier, far from the lush lands that once beheld the view.\n\nThe game plays from a Top-down view of your characters, combat revolves around Action Points and maybe a bit of luck ;) to resolve any experience. Weapons range from rocks, spears and knives... To sub-machine guns, rifles and shotguns... Chainguns and rockets all the way up to the sci-fi laser and plasma weaponry in similar previous fashions.\n\nThe Vault Dwellers or later to be known to most as The Wanderer... journey is one that always kept smirk of satisfaction on my face. The stories created here are later on exemplified in later games from the series.\n\nTL;DR: A game that was likely overlooked if you're in your early 20's and younger. Take the time, see how the story began and enjoy some good old fashion hexa-based combat.","November 23, 2014","true","50.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was amased by the game. The wasteland and its characters, the dark humour, the intense atmosphere, the kind of game you could just dive into. Being completely new to the fallout universe, I didn't knew anything about the original Fallout or Fallout 2. Since I liked Fallout 3 so much, I decided to try the original one.\n\nThe game is GREAT. The graphics, a bit shabby for today's standards, don't diminishes it in any circunstance. In fact, they are very nice, considering it's a very old game. The atmosphere was there from the start. From the introduction, to the gameplay, dungeons, characters, quests, the same eerie yet enthralling wasteland feel. The turn-based gameplay it's very interesting, considering it forces you to have a real rpg experience, differently from Fallout 3, that could be played as a "action" rpg. The music and sound effects are deep and enhances the experience a lot. The valt dweller's mission makes you really worry while travelling. Gathering information is a must, and every new bit of information leads you to new places and new experiences. A great game indeed. If you play it and like it, I highly recommend playing Fallout 2 also.\n\n","August 4, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fallout is the story of the vault dweller......no duh. He is sent out to look for a water chip because the one in his vault has died. It is a race against time to save your vault and meet some rather odd people along the way.\n\nThe atmosphere for this game is great. It is rather dark and sometimes rather depressing, however, it has some of the best dark humor I have seen in a game to date. The only problem I have with this game is that it is slightly unforgiving and will take a while to understand what you need to do and where you need to go. There is also a time limit at the start of the game, but it goes away after you main goal is done (Well, it gives you 13 in game years, which is more then enough time to finish all the side quest and more).\n\nI give Fallout a nice 4/5  for being a great game that holds up rather well for today's standards.","June 22, 2013","true","33.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some people say it's the best RPG of ALL TIME! I have found out the truth behind this claim.\n\nIt's a third person isometric game from 1997. It ran fine on my widescreen Windows 7 set up. Note you need to running a patched version where some bugs are taken out. I played the Steam version that ran fine.\n\nThe game is set in the USA in a post nuclear war era where much of civilisation has broken down or turned to dust. Some people have survived the nuclear fallout out by living in specialist underground bunkers called Vaults without much knowledge about the world above. You are tasked with saving your home after the water production breaks down.\n\nBefore you jump ship and begin the quest to SAVE THE WORLD by killing some rats, you need to define your character. I found there was no right or wrong way to do this. Just that each choice will affect your adventure. Choosing a low Strength attribute won't allow you to lug around all the junk that you find. Agility effects action points in combat and how many gun shots you can attempt. Luck, usually a garbage stat effects your critical chances and also your random encounters. You also have skills and traits to choose and develop.\n\nYou can't have a character that does everything well so you need to make choices on your play style. Go mighty sledgehammer or become a thief and pickpocket to riches. Specialise as a sniper or as a psycho killer, destroying everything that gives you a dirty look. Mwuahhaha!\n\nSaving your vault from water starvation is a small part of the overall story. It really gets interesting later on as you explore the desert and come across large towns and even a giant cathedral. Necropolis is full of zombie like ghouls and a super mutant group are on the rampage killing all before them. Then we have Deathclaws - legendary creatures that I found extremely vexing and impossible to take down. Eventually I figured out how shoot them in the leg or eyeballs.\n\nSo, read the manual and figure out how to interact with the world. There is a learning curve and at the beginning you will feel lost. Damn - where are those pointers saying go there and do that. The end story was quite interesting and I really wish I could do a third play through - but on to Fallout 2.\n\nOh - and don't ignore the timer to complete the initial water quest. I did on my first play through and the game promptly stopped when it said it would.\n\nOh, I came across a TARDIS in the wastelands and then an alien ship that had crashed that contained a picture of Elvis. I also found an alien blaster that was awesome.\n\nFantastic gem of a game. 8/10 as a modern game.","September 21, 2014","true","58.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it back in 1997 on CD-ROM and have owned a couple of other bundles which included it since, and have completed Fallout at least a dozen of times since first release.]\n\nThis was the very first of the Fallout games, and it is still in my all-time-favorite games list today. With added community enhancements, hi-res patches and unofficial updates, this game is still fun, unique to play, and more complex than it was on its release date; and the best part is, even a low-powered netbook can run this just fine. The post-apocalyptic world is diverse, the humor is brilliant to say the least, and this game is just worth being played just for the random encounters alone.\n\nThe character creation is fun, you get a wide array of cool weapons (such a modified shotgun based pistol!), and even after a number of playthroughs, there are still new items to discover. If you love RPGs, if you love a post-apocalyptic sci-fi setting, and if you have an affinity for the Fallout universe (even if you started with Fallout 3), then you should certainly give this a try, even if it might look a little dated. The graphics, as they are, in fact help the atmosphere. I probably completed this game over a dozen times.\n\nGiven the fact that Fallout is from 1997, a time in which video games were not quite established yet as a socially accepted entertainment form, the voice acting provided by actors like Ron Perlman, Michael Dorn and Dwight Schultz is also superb! If you don't like this game, you were born a generation too late and I feel sorry for you!","September 30, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is usually dark in most cases, kinda makes you feel like when the npcs' say, "It's dangerous there!" You feel like it's actually dangerous there. And speaking of danger, THIS GAME IS DIFFACULT. Half the time you die you don't even know the reason! Moving on to weapons and armor. New weapons and armor are quite rare, so actually finding a new weapon makes you feel great for finding it. I personally love this game, but it requires a lot of time, a lot of saving and a lot of imersing yourself into it, kinda making yourself feel like you are actually you in the game. I give it a 9/10.

Before going out, he peered his head into my room and left an Xbox 360 copy of Fallout 3 on my table for me to borrow. I was addicted. The start of the summer of 09' was spent wondering the DC ruins and soaking up everything that that insane game had to offer.\n\nA year later in 2010, New Vegas had came out. I ravenously guzzled it down within a month and was still hungry for more. For a massive history-buff like me, and all though it's set in the 2100's, the Fallout series offered a unique experience and had me totally engrossed in it's seemingly endless codex-like information and lore.\n\nSo, some time later it is payday December 2013. By now I am on Steam (albeit still a noob) and I am searching the store. I get home from a freezing night of Christmas shopping with the girlfriend, and I notice the 'Fallout Bundle' going for around £3. Was this real?\n\nAs soon as Fallout 1 had Installed I jumped on in.\n\nIt took a while to get used to the old turn taking system, but you have to be open minded. Playing game series backwards in age is going to be off putting so you have to try and enjoy it for what it is. Saying this though, I got bored (Guilty as charged) and didn't play it for about half a year. As much as it pains me to say this, I just lost my will to play it entirely from sheer boredom.\n\nInto the not-so-distant future and the Fallout crave had started to come back. I reinstalled F:aPNRPG and jumped on into a new game. This time round, I curbed my ego and instead of playing Fallout 1 like I played Fallout 3 and NV, I decided to take a completely different approach.\n\nI forced myself to remember, this game was made when I was fifteen months old. Times were different back then. So I dumped myself in the desk chair, grabbed a tall drink of cola and walked out into the Vault 13 Caves.\n\nI didn't look back, and what a game it was. A solid 10/10. A beautifully minimalist/simple and believable plot too. Try it for yourself.\n\nIf you are approaching this game from the future like I did, then be open minded. Only play it when you crave to. Otherwise you'll get bored and this gem will be missed out on.\n\nNext up, Fallout 2.","September 24, 2014","true","37.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it back in 1997 on CD-ROM and have owned a couple of other bundles which included it since, and have completed Fallout at least a dozen of times since first release.]\n\nThis was the very first of the Fallout games, and it is still in my all-time-favorite games list today. With added community enhancements, hi-res patches and unofficial updates, this game is still fun, unique to play, and more complex than it was on its release date; and the best part is, even a low-powered netbook can run this just fine. The post-apocalyptic world is diverse, the humor is brilliant to say the least, and this game is just worth being played just for the random encounters alone.\n\nThe character creation is fun, you get a wide array of cool weapons (such a modified shotgun based pistol!), and even after a number of playthroughs, there are still new items to discover. If you love RPGs, if you love a post-apocalyptic sci-fi setting, and if you have an affinity for the Fallout universe (even if you started with Fallout 3), then you should certainly give this a try, even if it might look a little dated. The graphics, as they are, in fact help the atmosphere. I probably completed this game over a dozen times.\n\nGiven the fact that Fallout is from 1997, a time in which video games were not quite established yet as a socially accepted entertainment form, the voice acting provided by actors like Ron Perlman, Michael Dorn and Dwight Schultz is also superb! If you don't like this game, you were born a generation too late and I feel sorry for you!","September 30, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like most games, Fallout has its quarks and times when you get a little frustrated at a small detail or lack there of. However, for myself, when I began to play Fallout I was enthrolled with the world in which I was to explore. Being a vet of Fallout 3 and New Vegas I wasn't sure how I would feel about a tactical turn based combat system. I was pleasantly surprised to find out how much it felt like I was playing a tabletop RPG. All in all, Fallout is a game I will always remember fondly with its exciting quest plots and interesting characters and situations. But it's downsides were slightly taxing, I would say it is worth $10 but if you get it on sale it is absolutly worth the time and investment.","August 3, 2014","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was amased by the game. The wasteland and its characters, the dark humour, the intense atmosphere, the kind of game you could just dive into. Being completely new to the fallout universe, I didn't knew anything about the original Fallout or Fallout 2. Since I liked Fallout 3 so much, I decided to try the original one.\n\nThe game is GREAT. The graphics, a bit shabby for today's standards, don't diminishes it in any circunstance. In fact, they are very nice, considering it's a very old game. The atmosphere was there from the start. From the introduction, to the gameplay, dungeons, characters, quests, the same eerie yet enthralling wasteland feel. The turn-based gameplay it's very interesting, considering it forces you to have a real rpg experience, differently from Fallout 3, that could be played as a "action" rpg. The music and sound effects are deep and enhances the experience a lot. The valt dweller's mission makes you really worry while travelling. Gathering information is a must, and every new bit of information leads you to new places and new experiences. A great game indeed. If you play it and like it, I highly recommend playing Fallout 2 also.\n\n","August 4, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are also possible to pick up books to acquire skills to a relative high level, and in this game you can even buy them from a store in the Hub. I suggest Saving often, especially before you start quests and the like because the game run on its own time table once you take a quest, and the bad guys might kill the good guy because you used to long. Which is one of the things I used to love about this game.\n\nGetting a Power Armor really makes things easier as it boost your strength with 2 so you never really need more than 8 in strength as 10 is maximum, Ranged Fighting is definatly the way to go so I really suggest stacking agility, perception and intelligence above the other stats (or cheat all the stats to 10 in everything :D) Anyhow the story is amazing, the music gives me goose bumps, and blasting muties to high heaven with a rocket launcher or saw em in half with my lazer gatling gun or Turbo-charged Plasma Rifle..... Worth every god damn penny.\n\nI think that Bethesda never did Fallout 1 or 2 any justice, it was like Fallout Tactics was placed in 3D, without the option for multiple party members.  I know I am a Bioware Fanboy, but I think they would have done a 1000 times better job with the game series than Bethesda ever could hope to come up with.

Although the world offers a lot of depth, it affects the player directly enough to inspire purpose. For example, it has more story compared to Icewind dale, but is not as long-winded as Baldur's Gate. Nevertheless, the writing is superb and combined with an amazing soundtrack it creates a memorable retro-futuristic experience. The game is also more open – there is a map, but it's up to you to discover if, when and where you will travel. Even though combat is turn-based, it is surprisingly packed with action. Just make double sure to turn combat speed all the way to maximum in options. Even today, one has to appreciate the animations when you blow a hole through an enemy's torso or cut him in half with a laser rifle.\n\nI think that since its release, I completed this game at least 50 times. So why do I still consider it worth playing after so many years, since I pretty much know its world like my own backyard? Despite all of this, there is still plenty of variety in the game. You see, the player has a great deal of control over how linear, open, short or long the playthrough is, even though you do not realize it at the beginning. So first, there are so many different approaches and play styles simply related to what kind of character you design and act as (commando, sniper, spy, librarian, doctor, pacifist, Hodor, etc.). Then there is the absolutely amazing diversity of how you deal with problems. When you complete it more than one time you will sometimes think: “Wow, I did not of this before!” Let me just point out that it is possible to complete Fallout 1 by leaving behind hundreds of corpses or by never killing anyone (I am not kidding). It all depends on how you observe, interpret and act upon the game world.\n\nAnd finally, there is our mistress random chance. Her effects are subtle and never in the game you get the feeling that regardless of your skill it all comes down to a coin toss (like in FTL, for example). But they are present enough for the game to be able to surprise you regardless of how well you know it. For example, in my many playthroughs only once I had such amazing luck that after leaving Vault 15 I was ambushed by a well armed party and after disposing of them I received a much better armor than is expected at that point in the game. Almost immediately after that I encountered a merchant party and decided on a whim to be an evil materialist. I put my above average gear to use and slaughtered them all. As I prepared my backpack full of goods to be sold later and thinking things can't get any better at this point, I received the Alien Blaster special encounter (never happened to me so early in the game). So before I even got to the Raiders or Junktown, I was already outfitted well enough to be a real threat to basically anyone in the game with the correct use of tactics. And on the other end – only once I had such bad luck that before reaching Vault 15, I was ambushed so severely that there was no way to ever win and I had to try very hard several times to even escape alive.","June 24, 2015","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
