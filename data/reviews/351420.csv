(Most Importantly - It Really Needs Full Screen)\n\nIt looks entertaining, and plays like an old Mortal Kombat, but the lack of Full Screen is a big draw back. Plus, local co-op without gamepad support is kind of a joke. Co-op on a single keyboard with about a dozen required keys for each player? No.\n\nThe music fits, and it done well. The "atmosphere" and dialogue gives the game a unique personality. Good.\n\nBut there is some poor programming in the game:\nBecause player 2 keys are default bound to WASD, you need to change player 2 keys to something else before you assign them to player 1. The program is not smart enough to remove the current keybindings (but it does not show an error in the settings...it just does not respond when you press the keys).\n\nI really think if they fix the key binding issues, allow full screen (even if they have to force a resolution change), and some of the other minor programming mistakes, they'll have a decent product. Add controller support and this is worth it.","February 16, 2015","false","1.6"," 42 of 53 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","42","53","3","5"

And not in a good way. My brain actually hurt after trying to wrap it around this game.\n\nI'm all for stupid fighting games. I paid full price for Girl Fight on XBLA. But I feel like no one making this game actually touched a fighting game in their lives.\n\nThere's Low/High Punch/Kick, then a Block button, then an Extra button. It's called the Extra button. The commands for special moves are mind-boggling. Block, Block, Extra, Low Punch for a normal special move? Did they just throw darts at a board to decide what commands are for things?\n\nIt's just a bad game, period. There's no modes that aren't just reskinned arcade mode or quick fight. There's no controller support. The AI is terrible. There's basically nothing to salvage here. Don't buy it.","February 20, 2015","false","0.6"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","0"

For a game that was meant to be taken as a joke I find the character roster totally uninteresting (infantry man, officer, pilot, sailor, nurse, cabaret lady, etc) and find the presentation to be somehow silly.\n\nThe worst part of the game is the combat itself which is broken because of the horrible hit detection. Also, there is just no way to counter a combo meaning you have no choice but to block until the whole thing has been performed. Even worse, you don't even need to learn the silly combo and special moves to be good at this game even when playing on the hardest difficulty. You can just use the same tactic over and over until you reach the end of the Tournament mode, which takes only 10 minutes to complete.\n\nAlso, let's not forget its technical limitations : the game doesn't feature any fullscreen or widescreen mode! And it doesn't support gamepad neither which is a shame for a fighting game.\n\nBasically, what you see on the store page is what you get. Veteran Combat is nothing else but a silly game that was meant to be played as a joke. It might entertain you during the first 10 minutes but not beyond.\n\nSee for yourself :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twF7PFidJvM\n\nRating :\n2.0","September 11, 2015","false","0.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

But I was wrong. Basically, this game kind've gave off the impression that this game was meant to be not taken seriously, supposed to be a homage to classic games that had live-action prerendered graphics and all of that, and a lot of people dig that especially people who like to stream silly yet obscure games, which is cool. Classic, retro and decided to take a modern spin for this indie title.\n\nWell, it HAS that but there were a few things that ruined this game from being funny and interesting to unplayable. All they had to do was have it so the game was controller-friendly and compatible. Was not even reading my ♥♥♥♥ing 360 controller which kinda bummed me out. Also, reconfiguring my keyboard was not registering certain keys. Now at this point It's not even letting me experience the true nature of the game simply because they were unwilling to add controller support, which is sad.\n\nAll in all, how you guys advertised the game made it a silly game to the point where there's no controller support and the configuration on your keyboard is absolutely horrible. and no resolution adjustments too! If you can fix this for me I would reconsider changing my score. Until then please fix this! I still have hope for this game.","September 9, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

It's a game that had me smiling, even when basic features like having the combo list IN game, or controller support weren't there. It's not hard, It's got an interesting mechanic regarding a god mode after doing a 6 hit combo, but all in all, it's just pure dumb fun.\n\nFor more information about this game and gameplay footage: http://youtu.be/Wm6VsNRs3BQ","February 16, 2015","true","1.7"," 29 of 58 people (50%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","50","29","58","6","6"

It seems to be easy, but try it on level hard! Dr Bloodpressure blocks me all the time :P The manual is great, it includes all the special moves and some funny background info of the characters. This game really brings back the feeling when we gathered with some friends back in the '90-s and played Mortal Kombat the whole night :)\n\nIf you play only the latest high-tech games then don't even spend that few bucks on this one as this game is not for you. But if you'd like to have an instant fun and want to relax then it worth buying this one. You can even compete with your friend on one keyboard like in the good old times :) How cool is that? :DDD","February 16, 2015","true","2.8"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","8","22","2","0"
