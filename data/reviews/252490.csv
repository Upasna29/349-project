"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abhorred/recommended/252490/","abhorred","karn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abhorred/","285 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote "Sorry guys :D" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be "shoot-on-sight?" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players.\n\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.","December 24, 2013","true","10.3"," 11,186 of 12,216 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","186","12","4","177"

Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.\n\nAte some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.\n\nI slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.\n\nThen I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.\n\nIts now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah, I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation, but thats a problem for later-me.\n\nIn a tiny hut on a mountain with my sleeping bag and meager belongings after 12 hours of playing straight, I can probably safely say I'm enjoying this game.","January 16, 2014","true","135.2"," 1,350 of 1,477 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","350","1","8","21"

(They will run up walls if they feel like it)\n\nControversial Features\n• Sleeper servers (Even when you log off you are still in-game, and able to be killed. Pretty much forces you put in time to build a stable base before leaving the server. Or risk being killed.\n\nRelateable Games\n• H1Z1\n• The Forest\n• DayZ\n\nConclusionRust can be a very fun survivial game, especially with friends. I put "DayZ" as a relateable game, but let me assure you they are two different games and should never be compared, other than them having a survival aspect. Rust can sometimes feel very slow pace on the official servers, so If you want to quickly build and join in on the action, id suggest a modded server with faster crafting and gathering. Overall, if you have the money, i'd suggest looking into buying this game. It is currently in Alpha, so really look into it before purchasing.\n\n\n(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)\n\nMy Profile: Click here\n\nCurator Page: Click here\n\nOne of the coolest girls on steam: Click here","July 24, 2015","true","110.5"," 612 of 662 people (92%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","92","612","662","35","9"

And the game can be very frustrating, but also very rewarding, so  I wanted to reserve my judgement and not write a negative review because I died, or write a positive one because I liked the novelty of the game. In the end, I want to like Rust, but I think it has too many issues in its current incarnation which are not being addressed to be enjoyable.\n\nFirst, the time investment needed to make just about anything from scratch is substantial. It takes a good few hours to go from having a rock to having  a small stone base, even assuming other players don't intervene. Finding a location that has all the resources you need on hand is more frustrating than ever now with the random map generation system; and it's important to understand that nothing you build in Rust is actually permanent; all servers will wipe on a regular basis, and all structures can be destroyed by other players - albeit at varying difficulties.\n\nSo that's all well and good - it's tough to find a location but it can be done; it's time-consuming to amass resources but that makes it rewarding, and it's fun to create something and try to defend it, right? Right. EXCEPT...\n\nOther players are going to be ahead of you. And they're going to make their bases right next to the beaches where players spawn and just camp the hell out of that area for no reason. If you find a resource rich area, good luck even farming anything in it - let alone trying to make a base - without getting shot. If you don't have a gun, you are not going to survive long... and the process of crafting guns is even more arduous than the process of crafting a base, because having a base is nearly a prerequisite for crafting guns.\n\nCombine that with the fact that there's an open-mic system and you often get whiney 12-year-olds complaining that they're getting killed or armed to the teeth and doing the killing... it really ruins the mood to hear someone who's not even the appropriate age to own the game piping on the other end of the mic, victim or victor.\n\nAnd the community are going to laugh at you when you mention that you've worked hard on anything. There are no friendly souls in Rust. You will be killed and lose everything on a constant basis, and you will have to spend hours or days trying to rebuild something that will only last for a few hours.\n\nIn short: resources are too rare, the disparity between the haves and the have-nots is too huge, the potential for (and encouragement of) abuse of noobs is too strong, and the accomplishments you can make are both fleeting and disproportionately hard-earned. If you want a survival game, find a survival game. If you want a base-building game, find a base-building game. If you want an FPS, for god's sake find an fps. Rust tries to be all three, and is about as big of a cluster♥♥♥♥ as you'd imagine that would make it - no structure, no rules, just endless trolling as far as the eye can see, and unless you've been playing for a long time and gotten quite lucky, you will only ever be on the receiving end.\n\nEDIT: Fixed some typos.\n\nAlso, I've seen several people suggesting that I move to a modded server; I will say all of my experience is from the official FacePunch servers without any mods. If you're interested in trying to find modded communities, some of what I've said may be untrue. I have a hard time believing that most things here would change, however, so I'm going to leave this review open.\n\nFinally: I've been accused of getting raided, then getting butthurt and writing a poor review because of it. I've also been accused of being 'too casual' or 'missing the point' of the game - so let me say I assure you that's not the case. Sure I've been raided, I've also done the raiding. I've played with friends and without, and across a few official servers. I enjoy a good pvp experience, and I enjoy a trollsy community; but I feel that Rust fails to provide any kind of entry point or protection from extreme grief. I actually think a possible solution is to make raiding easier, so noobies can break into it faster - an idea that would INCREASE the level of chaos on a server, but also close the gap between noobies and veterans. I LOVE the new epidemic of survival-sandbox games that have been cropping up, and I want Rust to compete with them. My problem is largely the inability of new players to stand up to anyone, and because they can't stand up to anyone, they can't catch up either - short of logging on in the dead of night to snag a few blueprints while (hopefully) nobody's looking. The issue at play here is that a significant portion of players I see starting this game - not myself - can't break into it... and when they get on chat and talk about what's stopping them from progressing, they get laughed at rather than helped - or even ignored. Again, I've put enough hours into Rust that I think a 'he got raided and got mad' argument doesn't really apply - can anyone with over 200 hours of gameplay in Rust NOT have been raided many times? That's not the issue, and I didn't write this review immediately after getting raided.","December 4, 2015","false","243.7"," 1,935 of 2,236 people (87%) found this review helpful 144 people found this review funny","87","935","2","144","95"

NOTE that I have 1500 hours put into this game on my main account plus a few more on this account so im a long time rust player. Now on to my story and experience.\n\n\nMONTH 1-2\n\nThere i was in the open field trying to figure out how to craft and make stuff. First shack I built I thought I was safe, no I was just a prey for players. They tore my shack down and told me if I wanted a room. Without clear thinking i said yes and soon after they trapped me in there house and I was made a slave. I joined another server and with a minutes I made myself a pipe-shotgun wooo!!!. As I went to farm i noticed 3 guys loaded with gear and heavy artillery. I thought this was a caveman game with no high tech weaponry, nope i was wrong when they shot that bullet in my face. Though i loved everything this game had going. A week passes and I find a hidden somewhat made base and without thinking again make my room right on top and start farming and making new things. Next day I wake up to find 2 guys building on top of the base I made and we have a short stare until they said they are sorry. They thought the base was abandoned. As I return from my farming routine I find a player stealing my stuff from the bottom part which I was going to use. His name was lunch  I took it to shoot him right away, but he shuts the door and managed to stay safe. We soon talked it out and made an agreement not to shoot each other. I trusted him and that was the start of a new friendship.\n\n\nMONTH 2-3\n\nMy roomates on top dissapeared out of nowhere and in the end it was me and lunch. We did what any rust player does survive and find new things to make. Then we found a player named tanaka. He was a fellow rust player and could make bolt rifles so we made a deal to offer a trade. after the trade me and lunch were thinking, shoot...kill... I chose not to shoot him. The three of us form an alliance and go out hunting for people and yes its the most fun satisfying thing in RUST and I hate it. Everything was perfect until we encountered them. A hacker out of nowhere aimbotted us and from then on we were careful to go outside with valuable stuff because you never know when they will decide to aimbot you. That didn't stop me and lunch until a hacker found our base one day. Turned out he was a little boy and wanted our codes to our house. We said no and he aimbotted us and destroyed everything we had and took so long farming for. That is when we decided to go to a community server as we said bye to the rust players and tanaka.\n\n\nMONTH 3-4\n\nNothing much to say but we just enjoyed our new rust community hacker free or so we thought. Even though there are admin there is a 50% chance that there is a hacker hiding his hacks or clipping inside houses when admin is gone. It was a fun time as me and lunch made new friends and enemies. Though as time went on less players showed up and thats when my good friend lunch left the game RUST. There i was alone but couldn't leave this damn game as i loved it so much. Yes i went back to the official servers and once started from scratch, or so i thought....\n\n\nMONTH 4-9\n\nThere i spawned i saw the one person i remembered, the one I didn't shoot, the one me and lunch hunted with. Tanaka{Robin}. He offered me a bed and my own room and we chatted for awhile and thus i told him about lunch . Days went to weeks and weeks went to months and slowly me and robin were building more bases and trusting each other with our items. We decided to spend all our wood on at the hanger and thus in a few weeks the batcave was born. During these times i also gained reputation good and bad. Most loved me and I made more friends who would later help me with my enemies. Those that were my enemies called me nothing but a low hacker hiding my hacks. My other sort of rival to own lands was a clan named RST and a few encounters i had with them i shot without any say. Then came another man who i would get to know more as the days went one. His name was doc baby ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I didn't really talk to him that much but enjoyed his say when a plane dropped an airdrop. ZE PLANE ZE PLANE. Me and robin didn't see him that much as he was in the other side of the map but he was an enjoyment. Everything was normal each day in RUST. Nakeds players, friends, hackers and more. FYI Doc refers the nakeds as hobos. Even later I slowly made friends with RST and respected them. REP(incinerator,pie,maddy). Then the horrible day came as me and robin encountered the servers first wipe.\n\n\nMonth 9-11\n\nMy love for Rust didn't make me leave,which i hate. NO, instead i went to another server and Rst was nice enough to lend me a small room. Heck i even saw doc and his ZE PLANE ZE PLANE. Robin was with me but made a different base and in that short time EA3 was back and everybody returned. Though not everybody I once knew were there as some of my friends and allies left Rust. It wasn't long until Yes even Robin left right when the server came back up. You will be missed. Thus it was me and my rock. Though there i was addicted to this damn game playing and playing. The batcave was rebuilt,hackers were doubling and players started to vanish because of hackers. there i went solo for a while then one day Doc visited my base and introduced my to Mr ROtten. We went out to kill hobos and later i gave them a guest room. I enjoyed their company and they are one main reason why i stayed in rust more. From friendly player i was turned into an asshat, No we turned to ZE Asshats. I trusted even more and gave them the codes to my entire batcave and so came the chapter of me and the asshats. Then out of nowhere it came again, dam servers.\n\n\nMONTH 11-PRESENT\n\nNew server new fresh start and new players. Me Doc and Rotten made a T tower and do what we do best which is snipe hobos. Its been a year and few months now and i'm slowly players are coming back though i'm not sure ill stay here any longer. I've been raided,c4ed, no clipped, befriended, Shot etc.. I have raided, killed, c4ed, and have done it all. I know every trick that rust has and still could possibly learn more things. RUST is a game that shows how you feel about players and what you are willing to do to survive. Rust has one main story and that is your story. I love this and and hate it at the same time. I will never forget how many friends i have made and friends that have left me. who knows i might have an encounter  with them again. This is my Story and history in RUST. I hope you will give this game a chance as developers are even making a new RUST. Thankyou and remember the name of the game is RUST not TRUST(sometimes).\n\nYar....\n","December 4, 2014","true","278.4"," 602 of 676 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","602","676","5","41"

We are from the UK and the local Russian crew that were working together made this fortress we went to raid. There was some in game rivalry between the Russians and, well... everyone not Russian. They went as a crew of around 15 and just hunted and raided everyone constantly.\n\nEn route to the base that day to recover some of this taken loot were about 20 of us, most from the UK. We only had 4 c4's but decided we wanted to try anyway. We got to this massive base, 20 odd storeys high and taking 2 mins to run all around. We discovered from 2 scouts we sent that there were only 2 Russians in the area, chatting on in game chat. We went for it!\n\nWe managed to get to the base, 20 of us charging, we killed the first guard, c4 on first metal door, dwarfed by this fortress. We got in and through the first 3 secure doors...Killed the second guard who was overwhelmed inside.\n\nWe were in the main section! We saw at least 100 boxes, all fully stocked with ALL of the best loot, 1000's of guns, 1000s of armor sets, 10000's pieces of ammo etc,etc,etc ! Literally months worth of time had gone into this base and the hording!!\n\nThe guard we killed first had set a spawn in a small building not far from the main base, he ran and replaced two of the metal doors we destroyed to get in, we were all too busy grabbing all the good stuff!\n\nAll 20 of us were trapped!! 1 C4 left. No way out of this metal fortress at all! We didnt have enough c4 and they had left none in the boxes on that floor!\n\nWe ran upstairs as far as we could before stopped by more metal doors and could hear the Russians shouting at us on the mics. Both parties knew we weren't getting out. They called reinforcements back to the base and a shoot out began, us from the upstairs windows and them surrounding the base! Around 50 of us all in within 10 mins! They tried to get in but we held them back, gun fighting in the entrance corridors.. they reset the metal doors. Totally trapped!!\n\nWe werent getting anywhere, taunts still flying on the mics back and too. We decided we would have to sucide or die, whichever way we were not getting out with the loot. Not a single item! So we grabbed everything and threw it from the crates onto the ground, it then disappears permanently. We threw EVERYTHING to vanish forever!!\n\nSo crazy watching all those hours worth of loot vanish in front of the 20 of us, whilst I played 'God Save the Queen' full blast down my mic to the Russians after we told them what we were doing with all thier loot.\n\nThose Russians were pi**ed off! You have never heard obcenities like it I can promise you that, in funny English accents. I still remember, 'YOUR FATHER, I PIG MATE REGULAR, YOU LIKE!!'\n\nThen we all commited a mass suicide!\n\nMartyrs of Rust.\n\nGreatest and funniest moment ever in gaming history for many of us included. You had to be there really, but still funny :)\n\n10/10","January 25, 2015","true","310.2"," 563 of 630 people (89%) found this review helpful 614 people found this review funny","89","563","630","614","15"

Ask them to enjoy it with you! Together, it's much more fun.The first 2 ingame days maybe a pain, but with friends you can easily build things up.If you are more the "solo survivalist", no problem! Search for a hidden place, maybe behind some big or small mountains where its unlikely that someone in the next days will come.Build your little shelter for the first ingame week and begin to harvest wood to begin to build you dream survival house.Let's go hunting! First for animals, then for humans.Better don't run up the streets the first week without a gun.Things can change very fast.A sunny wood harvest day can easily be a struggle when doing so.But check it out yourself!

My friend and I go outside, and see them waiting.\n\nThey said that they were friendly, but we didn't trust them. My friend and I got out our shotguns and told them to leave. They didn't listen.\n\nThen the war began.\n\nThey got out guns and shot at us, firing at all directions. My friend got hit, and yelled at me to get inside and lock the door. My friend barely got inside, but when he did, it was already to late- they were inside.\n\nLuckily, we had a panic room for this kind of situation. It had an iron door, which could only be broken down by C4. We rushed down there as the scavengers began to search our house.\n\nAfter a few minutes, they'd discovered we were in the panic room, so they began swinging at it with the pickaxe I gave them. It didn't work. When suddenly, I heard a boom. They had C4.\n\nMy friend and I discussed what we should do. We agreed that when we get taken hostage, we run like hell.\n\nThey eventually got in, took all of our gear, and we were naked again. They were about to execute us when suddenly, my friend got up and began to run. He ran as fast as the wind would take him. They missed every shot they took at him, so I decided I had nothing to lose, so I ran as well.\n\nIt was pitch black outside. I felt around and felt a bush, so I hid in there. In the distance, I could see torches everywhere. My friend saved my life, but the enemy was searching for him. There was nothing I could do, so I ran off, and began my new life.\n\nTo this day, I don't know what my friend is doing. Dead or alive, he's a hero. The enemy army got raided by an even stronger group, and me?\n\nI'm surviving.\n\nStories like this make Rust such a good game. It truly is an experience. I highly recommend this game. Although the glitches are a bit annoying, you get used to it.\n\n9/10","November 11, 2014","true","192.9"," 360 of 400 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","360","400","5","17"

Rust used to be filled with cheaters and I am pretty sure there still are some. If you dont play in a server with active admins or any higher authority, it can be very frustrating.\n-You have to be ready to devote your time into this game. If you have school the next day or work, don't play. You need about 3-4 hours to start yourself up. Finding food, getting clothes, finding supplies, and etc. Getting wood is a lot of work and finding a place to camp is also very hard. Your playing needs to be very consistent.\nThis game also has a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Say hello get shot. Give food get shot. Have nothing but a rock get shot.

Would I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you know what you're getting yourself into.\n\nWell, first off, Rust is a game of "Survival". But their definition of survival is... well... different. To be bluntly honest, the nature of the game encourages and rewards you for being an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. For a game that plops you naked on a beach with nothing but a rock, there are alot of guns and powerful weapons players can get easily and very early on. The game appears to cater to clan and group wars, which I'll admit, makes for some excellent videos. But the fact of the matter is most people (myself included) don't want to play that way. This game becomes a HUGE investment of your time as typically, it will require hours to build a "raid-proof" home. And once your home is finished, you'll look out at the beautiful sunset and log off, confident your hard work has paid off, despite the fact that your home is only 30% actual home and the other 70% is pure armor. But when you log in less than 24 hours later, you find yourself waking up on noob beach. Because for every hour you spent building your home, some prick has spent double that left clicking the attack button with one hand while furiously fapping with the other to wreck your hard work. But if you can manage to build a good home on a good server, the game can be a very rewarding experience.\n\nRust for me had alot of disappointing, infuriating moments, which often keeps me from coming back to play. But it also had alot of great moments. The act of logging on alone was an anxiety, waiting at the loading screen wondering if I've been killed or if I was still safe. The intense feelings of paranoia from the presence of other players and of protecting my home. The adrenaline rushes of being shot at, and of going on intense raid missions. The excitement of assassinating a powerful kingpin (who deserved it) or gunning down a warring maruader. And finally, the feeling of looking out the window of my beautiful home at a beautiful view of the sunset or a full moon on the ocean. A game has never before invoked as much emotion out of me as Rust has.\n\nI would reccomend these tactics for staying alive:\n- Play "Native American" style. Plant your sleeping bag in a bush where no one will find it, and live a life of very little materialism. If you die or are robbed, you lost very little\n- Hide. Build your home where no one will find it. Consider sacrificing a fort for a smaller home. It will be easier to raid, but harder to find. Raiders will assume there is a bigger bounty inside a bigger fort, but might decide not to waste their time on a smaller home because they'll think you're poor. Stay far away from the West and East coasts (where new players generally spawn), away from the middle of the map, and away from the road and rad towns. Build next to clusters of big rocks, or terrain that would be unappealing for travel (for example, tundra), and never in the open. You will likely be found eventually, but I have had games where I was either never found or if I was, players just left me alone. And it will give you lots of time to estabilsh your hold.\n- Play the game RIGHT after servers wipe so that you're the first person to start on a brand new island\n- TRUST NO ONE. You may find players that will like to trade or who will actually help you. But always practice your politics very carefully. Most players will shoot you on sight\n- Get a feel for the population of the server. I usually go to servers that appear abandoned and play alone for quite some time. Sometimes it works, sometimes the server suddenly becomes popular. You can refresh the server lists to constantly know how many people are on a server at all times. On rare occasions, you can find servers where the strongest players are friendly's who will actively hunt the kind of people who seek to ruin your day. You can collaborate with these people\n- Understand raid tactics. You can lock your door, but can they blow a hole in your window? Come in from the roof or the foundation? Did you destroy the stairs so no one can get up to you? Did you build a third floor in case they blow up the first floor ceiling? Did you armor the hell out of your cupboard so they can't build their way around? There are lots of things to consider, and the game is constantly updating in ways that require new strategies.\n- Raid a few homes yourself. I'm generally a peaceful player, but if I see someone setting up camp too close to my territory, I treat it like a threat. Because let's face it, it generally is. The players will eventually find your home if they haven't already, and you can't trust them not to come after you. Again, you can check the servers for population and you can scope out targets to determine if the player is currently online. Exploit weaknesses, get in, loot, and get out as fast as you can. Know how long the travel will take and take advantage of things such as the cover of night. Stay out of the road and weave through trees, bushes, and etc. Make sure no one sees you, catches your name, and make damn sure you aren't followed.\n\nGood luck and happy hunting","December 9, 2015","true","406.3"," 516 of 602 people (86%) found this review helpful 103 people found this review funny","86","516","602","103","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Audie_Murphy/recommended/252490/","Audie_Murphy","AudieMurphy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Audie_Murphy/","284 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've played this title off and on since legacy, and watched it change a lot as I've racked up the hours. An apt summary of this title would be that it resembles an (M) rated minecraft with guns and very heavy teamplay and PvP requirements.  These are coupled with gathering/building elements, with a dash of survival tossed in.  The build tools are functional and fairly robust.  The gunplay is solid.\n\nSo, why can't I reccommend it?\n\nWell, there are still issues.  Lots of them.  Hackers are everywhere, and if you play on the official servers you'll encounter this almost right off the bat.  Headshots thru brush in the dead of night, people flying around, noclipping thru walls, it's really bad.  Private servers are better but still not immune.\n\nAnother issue is the grind.  Holy mother of grind.  I hope you like hitting rocks, son.  And trees.  For hours and hours and hours and hours and hours on end.  Seriously, 9/10 of my played time was spent hitting objects with a hatchet, pickaxe, or hammer.  And then, once you assembled the materials together, you queue up a batch of gunpowder and then alt+tab and go watch youtube for an hour.  Then you come back, see what you have, and start making stuff with the gunpowder.  Alt+tab again.\n\nIt takes over an hour of queue time to make a single C4, on top of the assembled materials and smelting.  That alone will turn many people off.\n\nOn top of the time investment required to make high-tiered goods, there is also the matter of protecting it.  Which is where the main reason I can't reccommend this title comes into play.\n\nRust is a social experiment.  Anything you craft in-game can, and probably will be raided and stolen, no matter the defenses.  People will add you to their friends list for the sole purpose of knowing if you're offline or not in-game, so as to determine the perfect time to steal all your items.  Rust is a soul-crushing digital manifestation of what happens when the world breaks down and guns and explosives are the only form of barter or negotiation.\n\nIt is a beautiful game.  The sunrises and sunsets are majestic.\n\nWhat it does to people. however, is the exact opposite.  Rust is a more brutal, unforgiving, and relentless online arena than EvE Online - as even in EvE. you could park your assets in a neutral station and wait for the storm to pass.  Here, the storm is everywhere... right outside your door, crawling on your ceiling, while you're asleep in your bed.  Waking up to find your assets intact in Rust can be considered a major accompishment, and usually only practical for those in large clans which cross multiple time zones.\n\nUltimately. the game is fun, but the community makes it very difficult to enjoy for individual or small group gamers.  The mechanics are stacked so heavily towards larger groups and resource pools that banding up is a necessity.  Trust then becomes an issue.  Political conniving and intrigue and backstabbing ensues.  Hilarity sure to follow.\n\nI would echo other players' sentiment in that this title holds one of that most atrocious, obnoxious communities in gaming that I have ever experienced first-hand, rivalling LoL and DoTA2.  This is not a problem isolated to one server or group; it is pandemic across the entire community and as of date of this writing, it still exists in spades.\n\nThe core progression curve and experience is, on paper, rewarding.  It's a shame that the actual gameplay 90% of the time is 3 guys with guns chasing you down for your rock, ad-infinitum.\n\nOccassionally, as a solo player, you'll find a decent lowpop server which enables progression.  And the server admins will wipe your progress randomly midweek because they don't GAF about lowpop servers.\n\nIn all honesty, in spite of the many hours of immersion in this title, I think that nothing short of the mark of Cain could adequately rate this product, and of all the gaming experiences I've had in my life, this has been among the most frustrating and painful... on every level.  From random wipes, to hackers, to admin abuse, to 90 % of the community being total and utter mouthbreathing ♥♥♥♥♥♥-bags, any and all of which will destroy days or weeks of progress.  I wouldn't wish my time spent on this product upon my worst enemy, and I mean that.\n\nBased on what I've seen on rustafied, twitter, and devbuilds, the dev team seems totally disconnected from the gameplay experience, and their focus is not being spent in areas that positively affect gameplay.  I do not have faith that it has a long-term plan that will result in a well-received title by most gamers.  People have been asking for some type of legiimate PvE activity since legacy.  What they got was an attack helicopter that flies around the map murdering freshspawns as they try to farm blueprints without a weapon that could even hit the chopper.  Oh, and did I mention that the helicopter drops unique components for building automated turrets that you can only acquire in this manner?  What this translates to is that new and solo players now have an even larger curve to overcome, and the large clans that run every server now also have automated gun turrets all over their bases.  Balance.\n\nIt should also be noted here that this latest release still contains known bugs, some of which can cause your system and internet to hang or BsoD, leading to hardware damage and data corruption over time.\n\nIf you are going to purchase this title, make sure you have a large group with a high threshold for self-inflicted injuries and a LOT of time on their hands, and a recent system restore.\n\nFor me, this game exposed a darker part of the human psyche that I haven't seen for a long time, and hoped to never see again until the wheels fall off.  It's a beautiful game, hauntingly so.  But the amount of time investment to get anywhere is preclusive for most.  And for those who invest the time to dig deep into the game, they might not like what they find in their fellow gamers within this arena.\n\nThis is one of the few PC games where I can justly declare that there are no winners.  The only way to win at Rust is not to play at all.\n\nHow about a nice game of Chess?","June 29, 2015","false","047.5"," 951 of 1,162 people (82%) found this review helpful 205 people found this review funny","82","951","1","205","40"

Another negative game review for a game that is getting great press. How could this person be so ignorant of the majesty that is RUST? However, there is a specific reason I'm giving this game thumbs down. It will not go anywhere, it will take your 20 bucks unless you get it on sale, and say thank you for your money, and it will leave you feeling in some way molested after the experience of playing it for a few days.\nLet me first start off by saying the game is fairly well put together as far as it’s landscape. The game map has very few clipping issues, or pit falls that will leave you stuck, and unable to retrieve your gear if you can get back to your gear before it disappears. The higher end guns and ammunitions work fairly well together, and the graphics are pretty good up to this point in the games development, so I can’t give it bad marks in these regards.\nWith that said I must commence with the game breaking negatives this game has to offer. After a few romps around different servers it has become clear that the game engine of this game is so full of security holes it could be used as a cheese grater. What could have been an awesome game has been reduced down to a slew of game cracking trolls that spend their time finding exploits to the game that allow them to fly, summon in anything they want, and know exactly were you are on the map at all times so that they can kill you and laugh. After reading up on the web about this wonderful game breaking experience, I was sad to see that the game engine used for the game is the cause of this slew of security problems. In short, the game designers would have to completely port this game over to another game engine just to fix the issue of hackers galore. Meaning they would have to start from scratch.\nThis game is in Alpha stage, and I understand that the company still can say that it’s in Alpha stage and it will still have problems. The issue is the game will stay in Alpha stage. The majority of people that want/wanted to play this game have come and gone, the player base has been destroyed. For a game that is to be a multi player game it will not have the multi player community after it’s all said and done.\nPlease, I beg of anyone thinking about playing this game to just say no. If you want to end up either dropping the game after a few days of play, or turning into a Troll, please stay clear of RUST.\nIn truth please stay clear of any game that says ALPHA in its description. At least with a BETA game you can say it’s past the majority of its development issues. I don’t care what age, race, or gender you are. It’s your responsibility as the player to put a stop to game companies wanting to get the juice out of a lemon before it’s ripe. And in the case of RUST I will chalk this game up as a learning experience.\n\nEdited 7/3/2014\nOK, so I have to give the makers of this game major Brownie Points. they're actualy going to restart the game over on another game engine. Seriously this takes big man tenders to actualy accept the fact your product isn't going to work, and put forth the effort to fix it. Hats off to you guys working on this game, but still until the new release commes out, and it proves to be a lot more stable I'm going to keep this review up on your site. maybe some day I'll switch it over to a recommended.","May 26, 2014","false","51.5"," 437 of 516 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","437","516","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stormrhodos/recommended/252490/","Stormrhodos","Stormrhodos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stormrhodos/","250 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRust definitely has potential to be a good survival game,and in some aspects it already is. However, most of these good parts are countered by gamebreaking flaws in game design or massive issues caused by the community.\nI cannot recommend it at this stage because of the glaring problems that lie in the core structure and the Developers mentality. Even "it's an alpha" can't excuse some of the awful design decisions made by the developers,especially when it comes to core aspects of the game like Server administration and Balancing.\n\nThis review is mostly focused on the negatives because there's plenty of rose-tinted reviews upvoted on the store page anyways if you're just looking for something to convince you to buy it, so here's the most gamebreaking problems in it's current stage:\n\n- The big One: Server administration! The developers decided to give all the power to the people who are willing to pay for hosting Servers. Server administrators have a cheat console. In a game based on survival. Yep. They have Godmode(!!!) on command, can teleport any- and everyone where they please, spawn in items for themselves or others, change server Rules on the fly without anyone ingame noticing,wipe the entire server and reset everyone's progress to zero, ban/kick anyone they wish without having to give reasons...the list goes on and will probably expand if the developers decide to keep this "feature". Some people think this is a good thing.  The notion of admins flying around in godmode without taking damage from anything,spawning in explosives to destroy bases and kicking people just because they killed one of the admins or something ridiculous seems entirely fine to some people because they think of the game like Garrys Mod. And those are the same people whose recommendations based on an hour of gameplay you see upvoted on the Store Page.\n\nAnd if you think "surely admins won't abuse that power and it can be used for good only because admins are good people", you couldn't be more wrong. Giving admins a cheat console is ASKING for abuse. And don't get me wrong, there neeeds to be administration,someone to kick hackers and griefers (which there are plenty of,see below) but you cannot give anyone who decides to pay for server hosting a cheat console and expect them to only use it for those things.\nDedicated servers hosted by the game are scarce and fully populated and don't have proper administration, so griefers can flourish for days without ever getting banned.\nAnd the solution is so simple: DON'T give admins a cheat console. Give them the tools to get rid of hackers and griefers, and give those tools to the community too. Votekick! An option to report players. An option to atleast SEE which admins are currently on,and what the names of server admins are, and an option to report those admins if they are abusing their power,which happens all the time on many servers. All of this is currently missing, and it can easily break your experience of the game.\n\n-Server-bound progression: Everything you do in the game is bound to one server only,the server you are currently on.Now this sounds like it would be good at first,and yes,it is necessary to keep the balance and avoid serverhopping. But couple this with the cheat console admins and think about it. You might play for hours building up a base and then discover that all of it gets blown up by an admin with godmode on who decides to spawn in explosives and destroy all your stuff because he feels like it. Anything you do ingame is in the hands of the admins of the server you play on,and that is a huge issue which many people don't seem to realize until they experienced it themselves.\nThis would not be an issue if admins wouldn't have as much power as they currently have (and if hackers wouldn't exist) or if there were dedicated,modded servers with websites,active admins and features like votekicking or an actual working Banning/kicking software other than Steams VAC-banning which often takes several months to be processed and even then only bans the current account, not the IP. I don't doubt that those servers will start to form once the community has access to or developed new tools, but right now every server you join is a gamble, you might play for hours and get all of it destroyed by a power-abusing admin or hacker.\n\n-The big issues caused by the community: Killing on Sight (KoS), Griefing, Hacking,abusing admin Powers, regular DDoS-attacks, Killing freshspawns, camping spawnpoints, VoiP without mute feature (enjoy your 12year olds squeaking or teens trying to be bandits), the list goes on.: This obviously depends on your personality and if you care or don't care,but even if you don't care you WILL see it,and quite often,and won't be able to ignore it. Rust has no age restrictions, is quite cheap, has similarities to Minecraft and DayZ,and is hyped just as much because...well,it's a survival game and we all want a good one. So enjoy your hordes of wannabe bandits, squeaking pewdiepie fans and teenage godmode admins wrecking your base because you didn't comply with their wannabe bandit demands. Hacking is common, abusing admin powers is essentially the same and happening all the time. Killing on Sight seems to be standard because that's the trend that DayZs banditry hype sadly set. Camping spawwnpoints and shooting fresh spawns happens all the time because some kids just need to stroke their epeen on a daily basis by shooting unarmed freshspawns or people with far inferiour gear.\n\n- Balancing: People who have played on a server for quite some time will have all the best gear you can get. Kevlar-clad players with Holo-scope silenced M4s with laser sight and flashlight who are able to instantly heal themself up with large medkits at the press of a button are the sort of thing you'll inevitably face,naked or in cloth armor that barely protects you,with your rock or hatchet or maybe even 9mm Pistol if you managed to set up a shack before you got oneshot randomly for no apparent reason. The combat system is barebones, most weapons oneshot or kill a fresh spawn in about 2 seconds flat while kevlar armor seems to absorb Pistol bullets like a spongue, not to mention how much easier it is to hit someone with holo sights and laser designation. The blueprinting system seems fun at first and adds a layer of progression into the game but once you encountered a fully geared out person you'll see the issues with it: to even stand a chance of winning versus someone who has played on a server for a long time and has a base with tons of supplies somewhere you will need dozens of hours of gathering,crafting and farming zombies and "radtowns" for blueprints and a good bit of luck paired with the constant danger of getting oneshot or your base raided by snowballing fully geared "veterans". On high populated servers your base will inevitably get raided quickly before you can even build enough defenses to stand a chance, and the people who already played a long time on the server will simply be able to break through anything with c4 anyways.\n\n\n\nTheres plenty more issues with the game but those are the most potent gamebreaking ones you should know about. A lot of people don't know about these issues because they haven't encountered them yet or ignore them because of the hypetrain, and "it's an alpha" seems to be an excuse for bad design choices and massive core structure flaws nowadays, so I'll leave it at that.\nRust undoubtedly has positive aspects and I've had my fun building stuff with others, but until they decide to strip admins of their ridiculous godmode powers or dedicated servers with policing are established I simply cannot recommend it to you. I want a good survival game as much as everyone else but unfortunately Rust isn't it,at least not in the current state. If those glaring issues get fixed/ proper dedicated servers are established I will change the review/recommendation","January 1, 2014","false","28.9"," 1,454 of 1,846 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","454","1","0","53"

And then a funny thing happened.\n\nI saw a small house. It had no windows, but still it looked enough comfortable for me.\nThen I had a brilliant idea! I decided to destroy the door with my axe. I thought that the house will be full with stuff, but sadly it was almost empty. I was very surprised, when I saw that there isn't a sleeping bag on the ground. Then I decided to take over the house. But when I placed a new door, I heard steps. I put a door lock as fast as I could, typed in a super easy password (8888). And it was the real owner of the house. In front of his eyes the walls got upgraded to stone walls, the door got upgraded to metal door. He multiple times said:"Open the door, pu(t)a!"\nI had nowhere to go. Only one door.

I never left this world but instead began my time mingling with the local flora and fauna, once mauled by a bear in the dead of night as I was escaping from angry Russians with Assualt rifles and another gunned down by an angry helicopter as I inspected by loot, stolen from the corpse of an unsuspecting man.\n\nI started with my small 2 x 2 hut which lasted the staggering time of 27 minutes before I was beaten to death by angry men with rocks - Note to self, I really must get a lock for that door. They took my Wilson, torch, stone hatchet, blueprints and hammer, then disappeared into the night.\n\nLurking around on chat I found an active community whom deemed me friendly, I joined them only to discover they were actively at war with another "clan" - the lonely noob was cast into a great battle and was soon geared and ready for combat!\n\nIt ended in a hail of gunshots and looked like a scene from Mafia as my body was thrown against a stone wall from the sheer quantity of Thompson bullets hitting my frail body. I respawned in my bed, aptly named "Liquids S**g sack" and collected my meagre belongings - they team assisted me in taking a small and poorly guarded home on the airfield for myself. I joined with a few other solo'ers as we crafted and reinforced our little part in the world, we sent out supply runners and traded with the larger clans, all whilst maintaining good relations with the other server dwellers.\n\nThe day before the wipe, everything changed. Darkness fell that night as usual, I sat atop my tower with a team of three - we waited for the sunrise but little did we know we would be cast into a recreation of the purge. It started small, a few skirmishes here and there, the odd burst of gunfire or stray arrow but soon out outer wall was slowly chipping away. The Russians had found us and they were determined to get in, I moved around silently on our upper tower and peaked around, only to be met by the sound of my skull crushing under the weight of a finely timed rifle shot. I respawned quickly at the tower sleeping bag and retrieved my equipment, shaking I moved around to the lower firing platform and thats where I saw them, several members scatted on the rocks - I look aim - FIRE! I direct hit, his wails could be heard and my position was met by a barrage of fire. Wood splinted and the stone clanged as the air was filled with lead, we had lost the base, the encampment that has stood the test of time but in the end we were undermanned and out gunned.\nMy allies fell and with no local sleeping bags made were banished to the unknown of the darkness.\n\nA messaged appeared in the chat - "We are coming." - Our saviours had arrived, the local smaller groups had combined into a roving kill party to assist us. As I sit under my stone stairs bandaging my wounds, the cackles of fire eminated from outside, the rumbles of F1 granades, the sound of whizzling lead and the thrum of arrows was all around. Dirty, bloody and glorious.\n\nThe fire fight died down outside, I crept towards the sniping perch and peered out. It was done, we were victorious. We lost some brothers in arms but the day was won, I ran down stairs to greet my new brothers, opening my airlocks and reaching the front door. The door flew open as the electronic lock pinged, the team had assembled outside I walked to towards them and  ... BANG. BANG. I fell to the floor, screaming and bleeding. The voice chat icon appeared "We are sorry", they stepped over my body and began looting my gatehouse.\n\nSo ended my Rust adventure.\nThe treacherous "allies" will fall, I swear this.

Game was designed to play with friends or clans. If you play alone you will be severely disadvatged from minute one and you'll never catch up.\n\nLet me describe typical first 20-40 hours of this game.\n\nYou start naked with stone. For the next several hours you'll be grinding away to collect wood and rocks to build a basic house (storage). Be prepared to get killed a lot during this stage by better geared people who run in groups.\n\nFive hours later you have nice storage that should stand up to basics raiders. At this point you have to start going to high-risk areas swarming with better equipped people to collect "blueprints" that spawn randomly in bins. Now, without these blueprints you're stuck with basic gear and bow (no guns like you see in video, no armor etc.)\n\nIt takes A LOT of blueprints to get even a basic gun, problem is that to collect more of these you have to go back and forth to base, otherwise you're risking being killed (happens a lot) and being looted of all your hard-earned blue prints. Why going back and forth is a problem? Maps are huge and you typically spawn at the edge of the map near water. All the high-risk areas are towards the middle of map. It can take anywhere from 5-10 minutes of real time to walk to in one direction. Why not walk close to high-risk area and built house there you'll ask me? Because old-timers build their houses there first, typically right after monthly reset with group of buddies. So unless you log in to server right after reset and run close to airport and somehow manage to outplay local clan for territorial superiority, you're SOL. Hence, build house out outskirts of map where no one bothers to go to and walk for 5 minutes to find some bins.\n\nIf by some miracle you manage to collect enough blueprints (we're taking 1000+, when you typically get 20-50 per bin, which are pretty rare themselved) you have to build those weapons & armors using tier two materials (iron, gun powder) which you have to refine. That takes lots and lots of resources and can not be acomplished in one gaming session.\n\nNow you log out for the day, having collected enough blueprints and accumilating some tier two materials. You'll get more tomorrow . . . you followed guides and built raid-proof honeycomb base . . . you'll be allright.\n\nTomorrow comes, you log to game only to see your base raided and all your loot stolen. In some cases it would be pretty obvious(hole in wall, etc), but in a lot of cases you don't even see how it was breached. Hense the exploits and bugs in game which are constantly being used by hard-core gamers. There is no raid-proof base, hense there is no advacement in "solo" mode, you'll be outplayed by clans and groups in each case. They have collective power to get more resources, share gear, share C4, cover each other during raids, ganks lesser players in groups.\n\nSo now, 30 hours later you're back to square one and you dont' even know how your base was raided, you are nowhere near close to that gun or rifle. You're sitting naked with stone in your house ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nDo you start over or go write a review about the game and move on?

I think to myself why did i buy this game? I contemplate even respawning but i do. Only to be greeted by a man named Pablo. Pablo was a man of many talents, he took me under his wing and told me to follow him back to his base. I was not anticipating getting locked in a jail cell along with many other fresh spawns beside me, each in their own cell. Each cell had a window and i was on the ground level of the compound. I looked outside, we were surrounded by high stone walls and there was no way for anyone to get in and rescue us i thought, I was wrong. That night i heard explosions and looked out as i saw a wall come crashing down before me, it was a group of 3 people, but they were no match for Pablo, he shot all 3 but not before 1 chucked me an AK through the window... I wondered what i could do with this, could i kill Pablo having only played the game for half an hour? I waited for him to come with food and i launched my attack, he opened my door and i shot him in the head. I looked in his corpse and saw something i never thought i would, he was holding the rocket launcher the 3 men used to break through the walls previously. 7 Rockets were also there, i ran to the exit and blew out, using 4 of the 7 rockets in the process, Pablo was outside, i used a 5th rocket and blasted him. 2 left. I look to my left, there it was, the hole in the wall but i wanted more revenge, i decided to head further into the compound using my last 2 rockets to blast through a wall which had Pablo's sleeping bag and Tool cabinet in it. I struck gold. I authorised myself and destroyed Pablo's sleeping bag - I was now the ruler of Pablo's prison.

Next life, went to a house, they were performing a satanic ritual. We prayed to Shrek over the fire without any pants on. Someone began playing All star and we were shot immediately. We tried to stealth kill a boar, and it wasn't a boar. It was a bear. We made a shed, and I locked all of my friends in. We began to expand, and we got some decent gear. We met someone named Anal, and he said he could suck us up. We killed him because he wouldn't give us his pants. We met someone who would not shut up with an Asian voice, and continued to say "Ding ding madafaka" so we took about 10 minutes to kill him with arrows and rocks. We lost our house in the process. We finally found out house again, and it was inhabited by what I like to call "The Machine Gun Men" one of my friends began playing "This is the End" as we made out final stand on the roof. We jumped off, broke our legs, and were unmercifully killed with M4's. We found Anal again after we all died. I then met someone called Iron Tarkus whom I had recently summoned in Dark Souls. We made a group oath about killing the Machine gun men. We met the "asian" man again and he challenged us. Bears and wolves began to chase us as we attempted to kill him with rocks. Iron Tarkus, Anal and I finally managed to kill him. We were making a new house when a Machine gun man broke in. He was wearing a towel over his head and gave me a MP5. I decided I would have my revenge and killed him. Anal, Iron Tarkus and my friends met up again and we met someone called Kim Jong Un. He asked us if North Korea was that way, and we told him he'd just missed it. He typed kill in console after screaming "NORTH KOREA!!!!!!" Ironically enough we met Joseph Kony not far afterwards and we decided to keep him in our group. Kim Jong Un found us again, and we shot him once again. We then had a battle with the machine gun men while unarmed. We lost. I met a very generous individual who gave me multiple shotguns and tons of ammo. While we were setting up another army of sheds the "asian" man had found us again. He kept screaming "ding ding ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥" once again. He said we couldn't kill him, because he had his die move. I then proceeded to shoot him, but on sunglasses and say "Good thing I brought my kill move then."

They built the starving african village where they all lived in shacks no one had a weapon better than a bow or a metal hatchet they went to the radzone and found zombies to kill and food and some sacks. One day great warriors came and built a massive mountain of wood 50 steps from thier home. then every day three times a day they attacked the village and demanded tribute the africans hid in thier huts and left food and charcoal in the fire pit for the great warriors. The africans were sad and no one had any clothes except one man with a turban. One day the great metal sky god apeared and dropped his gifts to the world and the invaders left to recieve his gifts and blessings. The starving african village took the whole day to build and got a small long house and a great weapon that fired metal which they put a metal torch on and hid next to the metal doors of the longhouse in a sack. The africans felt strong they all had clothes and hatchets and bows and a single fire stick that could be held in one hand the next day they left no tribute for the great warriors and they attacked the long house and used explosives on the doors of metal the africans fought back and were utterly crushed and forced to leave the land of thier ancestors where they had starved to death so many times before due to lack of chicken and they were killed everywhere they went every time. THIS WAS THE BEST TIME EVER IN THE GAME\n\nI got the game during the dutch auction phase which proposed it as a primarily eve survival game with zombies and extreme threat of cold and hunger. Now there are no zombies because they were removed ( dispite this bieng promised earlier when it was originaly released) and there is nothing but pvp they only focus on that adding weapons while water still does nothing and there is not thirst. its really sad all people do is attack freshspawns and take thier stuff even though they only live in a shack and have 1 piece of chicken a stone hatchet and a pair of socks and a hand full of rocks.\n\nNext complaint sleeper system... Worst idea i have ever heard. Combat logging was the only way freshspawns and friendlys could keep gear and now they cant log off safely even outside of combat. One time i was given a full kit of m4s shotgun c4 and full kevlar the server was laggy and i disconected. Join back 2 mintues later i have been killed with a rock and have nothng.\n\nNext complaint combat. It is entirely unfair people who have kevlar and m4s attack people and are impossible to kill for anyone without incredible weapons. it doesnt matter what you do shoot them 5 times with your pistol send an arrow literaly through thier skull so you see it going in and out both sides or unloading clips of ammo on them because they have medkits in thier hot bar so all they gotta do is press 5 when they get hit 6 times and they wont die dumbest idea to have instant healing kits.\n\nRadzones are now so hard to get into people either block them off or there are so many bears/ wolves that you need guns and armor and pills to get in and out so why even have them its not like the loot there is even that good\n\nthe map itself is actualy pretty small and only has one road\n\nand how long has this been pre alpha its terrible\n\nTHIS GAME HAD POTENTAIL IT WAS SOMETHING FUN ONCE BUT I WAS LIED TO AND IT IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT IT WAS PROMISED TO BE INSTEAD OF A GREAT CRAFTING AND BUILDING ZOMBIE FREE ROAM RPG EVE THIS IS A PVP WITH BEARS AND INSTA HEALS AND YOU LOG OFF AND WAKE UP DEAD WITH NOTHING NO MATTER WHERE YOU LOGGED OFF I HATE THIS GAME NOW AND I HAVE UNINSTALLED IT\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME ITS TRASH","December 14, 2014","false","34.4"," 183 of 217 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","183","217","0","1"

In Rust you may choose to play alone or with others to survive, build, and loot.  The game is at its best on its community servers as the official ones tend to be overly crowded and very intense for a beginner.  In Rust you spawn in a random area of the very large map with nothing at your disposal but a rock, a torch, and bandages (Depending on the Server).  With that rock you begin your seemingly overwhelming journey of gathering supplies, supplies allow you to create tools, and buildings.  From there most players choose to explore their surroundings and upgrade their defenses.\n\nThis game while enthralling is a time consumer and requires a lot of your attention, other players can kill you and loot your corpse.  I've spent hours upon my intitial spawn working in a community of players building a small city and upgrading to metal walls.  We traded supplies, hunted together, looted nearby rad towns, and even slowly accepted new players into our ranks.  Our small group had become a society, we aided those who needed help and defended our small city from other players masked as bandits.  We had come to know each other by first names and trusted that our things be safe while not ingame, as there was always another player on watching over your city.\n\nThis game is perhaps the first game to create a challenging but engaging true to life experience.  Things I had never experienced in a game before such as trying to decide amongst your fellow founding members if the lone newbie could be trusted behind our walls?  Do we let him in?  Should we make him bunk in the Newbie quarters overnight until he pulls his own weight?  Are our walls truly safe?  Who should be allowed to carry rifles?  How can we expand our society and truly be able to keep our loot safe?  All of these questions come into play at any given point.\n\nPlay with the right people, on the right server, and you too can have this experience.  As for that society?  What led to our unavoidable demise?  One lone player trusted behind our walls was able to level everything in just a few hours.  That is part of the game though, that experience, is what defined for me what games should be aiming to deliver a one of a kind experience I can experience nowhere else.\n\nYour experience may vary, your story may differ, but mine definitely enables me to recommend this game to the average player.\n\nIf you enjoy working hard at something, having a totally different survival experience, definitely buy this game.\n\n*I can't recommend this to someone who enjoys a quick shooter game or fast paced experience, it is slow but the rewards are so much greater.","October 4, 2015","true","70.2"," 125 of 141 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","125","141","4","5"

Create alliances with other players and together form a town.\n\nWhatever it takes to survive."\n\nExcept you can probably just shorten that middle paragraph to the "Protect yourself from other players" bit. The other aspects are pretty much non-existant. In the mere hour or so I played of Rust, I died more times than I can count on my fingers from players. Not ONCE did I suffer a death of hunger, cold, or at the hands of any NPC. This is no exaggeration either. Literally 2 seconds from joining my first server, a naked guy screamed on his mic as he beat me to death with a rock. Admittedly it was hilarious at first, but the ♥♥♥♥ grows incredibly tiresome. Being attacked by everyone on sight, when you have nothing at all to loot, is not just frustrating but downright silly at times.\n\nI walked up to a player and asked him how do you even craft in this? It was legitimately my first hour or two playing. His answer? "Welcome to Rust" as he gunned me down with his M16 looking rifle(which you can convienently craft in a post apocolyptic world!). Three more tries of asking different players just how to do basic ♥♥♥♥, only to get killed in return with sarcastic "hehe i troll u" comments. I looked up a guide instead, to which I think I died 3-4 more times while reading it through the steam overlay.\n\nThe PvE aspect of this game is next to none. The zombies, wild life, or any other potential threat not player controlled is spaced so far apart, you're more likely to die from another person 10x over before even seeing your first boulder that you can harvest from. The building part is not necessary to "survive" in any sense, unless its to take cover from other players momentarily. The only part of crafting you'll ever really find yourself using - once you craft some of the basics necessary to progress - is the weapons and "armor"(clothing) part, very much with the reason being to defend yourself. There are no alliances with other players or forming of towns unless you already knew these people beforehand. There's honestly no incentive to trust outside people anyway, considering they can just break into your ♥♥♥♥ and loot all your stuff while you're logged off or are not present on the server.\n\nIt seems like this game is geared more toward just being a PvP FFA, with minimal emphasis on the crafting/resource gathering elements past a certain point. I mean, looking at the Twitch channel for this game the entire first 8 streams right now are of people with guns just hunting down people with little to no gear. For what purpose? I guess a sense of empowerment when killing defenseless players? Kind of pointless to me, but I'm sure people might actually enjoy it. However, like I said, I don't. At the moment I can't really recommend this to anyone, unless you enjoy a very PvP, grief centric game.","December 16, 2013","false","2.0"," 2,568 of 3,523 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","568","3","0","117"

In rust you need resources to build, if you "steal" another players resources i.e. (blow their brains out and take from there corpse) you can build faster and protect yourself better. There is also an advantage to forming a group but this comes with its own risk i.e. could I tolerate this squeakers voice for more than 10 minutes, will he betray me, is he utterly useless, is his cod piece bigger than mine. :)\n\nEvery encounter is a adrenaline fuelled adventure leaving your heart pounding and your butt cheeks clenched, oh and either the euphoric thrill of victory from defeating an enemy or resisting the urge to punish the keyboard when you get shot. No other game I know of lets you grind your enemies into dust quite like rust, first you kill them, then chop the body up for meat, then destroy their base, then take all the resources they spent hours collecting, and last up dinner time "fillet of enemy" whilst telling the guy you killed your eating him in chat :).\n\nYou start with nothing but a rock and a torch but with enough time and dedication you can build an empire. You don't need a team to survive in rust although it does make it easier. Anyone can have a big base with all the trimmings if you play smart.\n\nI have over 1200 hours in this game and have only every seen a few hackers, if you play on a server with active admins they will ban the hacker immediately. If anyone wishes to buy the game but does not want to play alone then add me on steam and you can join my group of players and we can give you the rust crash course.","May 5","true","352.2"," 182 of 222 people (82%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","82","182","222","35","9"

This game is absolutely brutal, but it's ridiculously fun. You can spend hours gathering stuff and building an amazing base, only to have some jerk come by and blow it up. I've been killed by bears, chased by helicopters, and shot by strangers. I've claimed an island for my own, built up an arsenal of weapons, and lived in a cave. I've made some awesome friends and dangerous enemies. Once you learn the basics, this game is an absolute blast (sometimes literally... heh, c4).\n\nMy advice? Find a small, well managed community server to play on. I've avoided official servers so far and have had a blast on an unmodded community server.

You get a rock and a huge map to go do rocky things with your new friend.\nI quickly discovered that life in Rust is very hard. The animals are ♥♥♥♥♥, the other players are ♥♥♥♥♥, and someone made a ♥♥♥♥ out of campfires.\nNow you may be asking yourself "Does this help me survive in Rust?"\nNo, it doesn't. So as you play, you may be asking yourself important questions, such as:\n"Why do deer give chicken meat?"\n"Who's that naked man with a rock?"\n"Can I kill that naked man with my rock?"\n"Who are all these people doing cult dances around me?"\n"Where the hell is all my cooked chicken?"\n"Admin, please stop calling in airdrops?"\nThese are good questions to ask, and they have very good answers.\nBut **** you, I'm not answering them. Just play the damn game and play Chase The Chicken. With a rock. Because that's all you do during the first hour of gameplay anyways. Now I shall detail out the pros and cons of this game.\n\nPros:\n1. Chicken out of everything. If you're a vegetarian, screw you, meat is godly.\n2. Rocks.\n3. Managing to craft an M4 out of metal sheets complete with "Made in China" decal.\n4. Radiated animals that go out of their ♥♥♥♥ing way to chase you over rocks\n5. Player vs player gameplay\n6. Gunfights that heavily favor rocks\n7. I found an M4 in a crate once. It was glorious\n8. Unlimited replayability. *snort.*\n9. Throwing flares into people's bases in the middle of the night yelling FLARE PARTY\n(Note: number 9 might get you shot. Just throw more flares and run)\n\nAnd of course, every game has cons. Here are a few I noticed:\n1. No Nazis to shoot. Every game needs Nazis to shoot. Please update this\n2. They removed the zaombies. Wait, this is a pro.\n3. Rocks\n4. Did I mention we need Nazis to shoot?\n\nThose are the only cons.\nSo all in all, I give this game an Apple/10, please add Nazis to shoot at.\nAnd remove those player controlled AI bots.

I've been gaming for over 10 years on both pc and consoles, I've played hundreds of different games. But I can say with certainty that Rust is the best game I've ever played in my entire life. It is life-ruiningly addictive and even more fun most of the time. But don't get me wrong the game will make you angry, take the maddest you've ever been at a game and times it by 50 and that's how angry rust can make you.\n\nI've actually just spent $5000 on building myself and my girlfriend a new rig each so we can play rust on max settings. (Since we've been playing for a year on an 8 year old desktop pc, and a very basic laptop).\n\nI've played around 1,500 hours at the moment, and once I get my new computer I can easily see myself doubling or maybe even tripling that number.\n\nThe game truly is a work of art, it has amazing graphics and even looks good on low graphics settings.\n\nNo other game out there can get you on the edge of your seat, blood pumping, heart racing and shaking like crazy from anxiety while in a gun fight or even just running away from a naked that has a spear while you have an inventory full of supplies while your out of ammo or simply can't kill him.\n\nIt has an incredibly complex and fun base building aspect. I know players who play the game mainly just to build giant castles and whatever else they can think of.\n\nGun fight's are probably the most realistic out of any game I've played and they can get really intense at times while also being quite fun (if you're not getting killed all the time.)\n\nOn top of all that the developers of the game, FacePunch. Really do seem to care about this game and where it's going in the future. The game has progressed so far in the 12 months I've been playing it. I can't wait to see where the game goes in the future.\n\nDefinitely the best early access game out there, and its going to be an absolute game changer once it's released.\n\nI could go on all day about what I like about this game but I'll leave it short.\nBest. Game. Ever.\n\nIf you're thinking about buying the game I would definitely urge you to do it, you won't regret it.\n\n\nEDIT: Unless you have a question about the game, or something positive to say. Do not comment on my review, I don't really care for others opinions and I am sick of all the little trolls. If you decide you want to be a troll, I will simply delete your comment and forget you exist.

I’m not a fan of the traditional roadmap. I don’t want us to feel tied down to features and timescale. We’re hobbyists at heart – we’re not a game factory – we don’t need that kind of pressure."\n-Facepunch\n\n\nTLDR:  If you buy this game, expect it to never be more than an alpha close to its current state. The developer sees no need to hurry, nor even to finish this game. Consider the game as it is, the finished product. As such, I can't recommend it.\n\nElaboration:\n\nI've put a lot of time into this game over it's life, as you can see by my hours played (though a lot of those hours are simply having Rust up, not actually playing, but still). It's been a simple game due to a slow development pace, and then the remake of it. Even still, it has been tons of fun even through all the hackers, shoddy networking architecture requiring you to restart from scratch every week or two, and lack of content (though I would say I've had so much fun due to the bond's I've formed from interactions in the game). I've been patient throughout all the issues Rust has had and tried to enjoy myself, but that above statement pretty much sums up the state of development for this game, currently, in the developers own words. It's a shame that a game that has had so much support from the community has become a game where the developer has already written it off as a success due to the amount of early access backers and don't feel a need to put much work into this game anymore. They can't even be bothered to update the video for this game, which is currently showing the old version and numerous features, which simply aren't implemented in the remake.\n\nThis game has always been developing slowly since it first came out, and now you're lucky to get more than one feature per update (and updates may come every month or two), and when I say feature I mean like a new type of lock, or one new building improvement/addition, not even anything that big. Don't get me wrong it's moving, albeit incredibly slowly, in the right direction, but there's simply not enough content to justify anyone buying this game since the remake, nor does the developer seem to care about ever actually finishing this game. As they say, they're hobbyists.\n\nThis game seems to be going the way of DayZ, though at least DayZ hasn't gone backwards with starting over again.","December 14, 2014","false","120.2"," 385 of 513 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","385","513","0","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkrieg/recommended/252490/","blinkrieg","Blinkrieg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkrieg/","272 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game started off as a magnificient survival game set up in a sombre atmosphere, with a unique art style, a huge map with tons of details, a building system like no other we've ever dreamt of, an unbelievably caring and cooperative community and lots of adrenaline rushes caused by strangers, zombies, and rad animals. In short, it was about primitive men—some better geared than others—versus nature, making friends and enemies along the way.\n\nAt some point Rust was rebooted from scratch. That made a lot of sense back then because the amazing concept behind the game was being hidden by its modest technical level, and the messy code in Good Ol' Rust supposedly hampered developers’ progress to an ill extent. Getting more features and a better game seemed optimal. This new thing was labeled Rust Experimental.\n\nNow, two years later, Rust Experimental is simply known as Rust. A lot has changed since the beginning of said massive revamp. I'll give you one thing: it looks fantastic. It totally does.\n\nThe negative side? The game has totally turned from a survival to an FPS. The community is now crowded with players who are intellectually uncurious at large: they are not interested in interacting, they will never ask for food nor will they try to convince you about letting them in to spend the night, and they will not cooperate in any way. If any of the previous ever happens to you, it will be to kill you and to raid your house. Most of the times they will refrain from using these old tricks and just shoot on sight with an AK-47, rocket launcher, flamethrower, or sniper rifle with a 4x-zoom scope if they are able to. Everyday they stay late at night with one goal in mind: use C4 to raid as many houses as possible right when everyone's logged off.\n\nPeople are simply not open to expanding their friend circle, and so the hilarious and creepy dialogues and situations that made Rust the best game I've ever played they're all gone. The developers' ill emphasis on military weapons has taken this too far away, to the point that I've found myself playing DayZ trying to recover some of this experience while still visiting Rust from time to time to check on the progress of users' devastating mindset and the building system, which I still enjoy quite a bit.\n\nSome other bad bits that are in no way nearly as defining as the ones above: developers are poorly organised and seem to tackle issues randomly instead of as a team, developers' progress is tedious to follow mostly because of their lack of focus, realism and priorities (although they manage to pull some decent weekly devlogs), performance is poor and seems to be slowly getting worse, the building system hasn't received barely any update in a year (bugs are virtually the same ones as back then), developers' only goal in life is adding modern weapons to the point that even this new FPS-addicted hostile community is feeling wrong about it, procedurally generated maps are losing features for no apparent reason (amazing desert and snow biomes, forests and canyons suddenly just flew away), caves have never worked properly and old Rust's rock formations which allowed players to hide, build shelters where they'd never in a hundred years be found simply don't exist anymore. Animals have not worked at all for two whole years and they want to have it fixed by June (!).\n\nNow let me tell you a story. Facepunch didn't like the zombie fashion, they took them out of the game, put rad animals instead and took them out again when moving to the new Rust. After that, they spent years deliberating about adding NPC hostiles (there are none), doing intellectual work on the topic, coming up with amazing new beings that would terrify survivors, thinking of refined concepts that would shatter the world as we know it. After all that effort on a paramount subject, the only NPC threat now in the game is... guess what. A cannibal tribe? An ancestral monster? A wizard in a tower? Nope: a chopper, a ♥♥♥♥ing chopper with a machine gun. You still think it's not that bad, huh? Okay, picture Facepunch staff would be replaced by one CoD-mad 14 year-old, tell him to develop a concept for The Boss of a game like this and give him two hours instead of two years. You and I know even he would've thought of something better.\n\nAnd have I said this game requires too much time? Several hours daily. And also that it includes a few pre-gun powder weapons who no one can use thanks to the mindblowing number of guns?\n\nThere are a lot of minor points I could make too, but I'm lacking the energy and time for it.\n\nIn case you are considering this as an FPS purchase, I firmly believe it makes no sense for you to go through the annoyance of building a house, gathering blueprints and resources, crafting weapons, trying not to die at night, and moving from wipe to wipe if all you want is to simply shoot down some people. Of course, this game allows you to shoot down some people who really care about what they're doing and who're expending a sick lot of time putting effort into building their place, which I have come to understand motivates a bunch of people. (Sigh)\n\nIf you are still going to play it, bring some friends from real world and enjoy the bloodbath or simply get abused non-stop playing solo.\n\nRust is opposite to what made it different.","February 3","false","730.3"," 287 of 375 people (77%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","77","287","375","22","13"

Garry and the team at Facepunch have done right by the community in revamping the game and really putting a ton of effort into it.\n\nFrom my perspective, I think the game looks great, runs much better, and has some cool mechanics. Aside from those points, I really cannot say this is a good game. It simply requires too much time - and no matter how much time you're spending on it - someone else is spending more time than you. It's a neverending circlejerk.\n\nYou spawn with a rock and a torch and you have to build up from there. Maybe you make a small hut the first night. Let's just say you wait 2 days between the time you made that small hut and you log in again to continue your progression. Guess what? Your hut is gone and you've been killed. This doesn't just apply to new players - you constantly have to restart because there's always someone who will be on when you're offline.\n\nRust players will tell you "build on a rock" or "hide your base". Well yeah, that works, except you have to bascially use game breaking stuff to do the first part. People will climb huge rocks by using foundations ( a building element) and then deleting them. As for hiding, some people find cheaty ways to make their houses in a rock or use indestructable stuff to surround it with.\n\nI would love to recommend this game, it has a lot of TLC put into it.

I've noticed a lot of bad things about the game so far, a lot more than good things... I know the game is only in Alpha, but a lot of what I write in this review probably won't get corrected. But for the record, this isn't my official review of the game... as maybe I'm currently just having a bad experience with it so far.\n\nPros:\nVoice chat with a limited distance to a player is a nice feature. There are a few nice players in the game which try to help new players out a little by giving them armors and weapons. Whether you like the game or completely hate it, if you love the survival aspect of it, then it is somewhat addictive. It is fairly difficult to handle the recoil of the guns which I like cuz it adds a need for skills to handle them properly. The survival aspect of the game seems to be well done in the sense that you can get cold, hungry, bleed to death from a bear or zombie attack, etc... and you always have fear on the brain because you never know who will attack from where or if a zombie or bear will pop out of nowhere to attack you.\n\nCons:\nEditing game options hardly works at all: Raising or lowering graphics detail does nothing, only resolution changes have any effect, editing control options before launching the game does nothing as you need to change it again once in the game, and the in-game UI seems to have minor issues too and feel too basic. Half the players are bandits and shoot on sight or pretend to be friendly until your guard is down for just a second. The map may be big, but the terrain all looks the same... it's so ridiculously easy to get lost in the game or lose the spot where you placed your base. Also, while the map is big, it still always feels crowded with players even with a 50 player limit. There's only 1 non-PvP server out of hundreds and it's only 128 players and is always full so don't ever expect to be able to force your way in there. There's no way of knowing which player killed you or trying to kill you unless you were up close to him and had a chance to see the name before dying... The detail in graphics are only slightly better than 7D2D (although they have plans to greatly improve that) and yet it requires so much more out of your GPU (first game I've ever needed to lower my resolution and even then could only average 45fps until a gun fight breaks out lowering it to about 20fps). All the good items in the game require you either find blueprints or find research kits which seem to be extremely rare because I never once found one in the 15 hours of play and I explored a lot and visited the rad cities a lot. Night time leaves you 100% blind or if you use a torch or flashlight or make a fire, makes you a really easy target for bandit players... therefore the only safe option is to hide for 20 minutes of the game in total darkness until it's daytime again which is really boring. No matter how much effort you put into making your base secure, they'll always get in the moment you log out... or will destroy the base with C4 with you in it... The few players who are friendly are so nervous that even they sometimes shoot on sight out of fear of being raided... It's just a game loaded with frustration and stupidity... speaking of stupidity... I shot a naked guy in the head with a 9mm 3 times and he was still trying to attack me with a rock (then the bear clipped through the floor and killed me). Wearing a complete set of leather armor hardly protects against bullets... you still die in 1 or 2 seconds depending on attacker's aiming skill and it requires so much effort to make the armor so in the end, you're better off just running around naked and pretending to be weak since you have pretty much the same chances of survival in a gun fight. And new players with nothing worth mentioning in inventory and completely naked get killed for no reason, they have no weapons and give clear signs of non-hostility (jumping and/or voicing friendy in chat), bandit players seem to kill anything that is near them and are always in groups so you tend to not stand a chance against them even when in your base. Animals can clip through structures to get to you without warning (can reach you on the top floor while the bear is underneath). In the 15 hours of play, I still felt as though I had nothing worth fighting for in my base... I was so limited because I couldn't find blueprints that I needed or even a research kit to be able to make my own blueprints. PvE is a bit challenging at first until you have your first true weapon, then they become easy prey (if they remove zombies from the game, PvE will really have nothing left in terms of challenge, so they'd need to add something else to take it's place). You're very limited in how you can build your base in terms of materials used, where the walls and doors can be placed, if there's terrain clipping through the foundation, you can't place anything near it, etc...\n\nIn the game's current state, I'd rate the game below average and is no competitor of 7 Days to Die because 7D2D, which is also in Alpha, has so much more variety in every meaning of the word and effort put into the game and allows players to fully customize their servers and you even have the option to play offline which is still lots of fun because PvE is being designed really well. I haven't tried DayZ Standalone yet, but I hear that game has just as many issues right now, so maybe DayZ is a good competitor with this game. I might put in a few more hours into this game later on if I can find a non PvP server that isn't always full, but till then, I kind of regret buying this game, especially at full price too. While $20 isn't a total rip-off, knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have paid more than $5 - $10 for it.","December 16, 2013","false","15.2"," 394 of 534 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","394","534","2","13"

I guess you 500 people who disliked this review feel pretty stupid at this point, huh.\n\nShame the game has been made with 99% of the exact same disgusting development mindset, but now instead of having the option to dedicate time and effort to harvest materials, your progress is instead capped on a daily basis through rétarded time-set spawns for both rock deposits, animals and even moreso random blueprints dropped from barrels that are required for literally everything past flimsy stone buildings with physical keys (that drop when you die) to your doors while deathmatching and utter devastation of anyone that is even remotely new on a server is more prevalent than ever.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn excellent example on how you can take an absolute brilliant piece of concept and turn it to utter rubbish by messing up the execution part. Rust is so severely plagued with moro nic developer decisions, It's physically and mentally painful to play it for more than an hour.\n\nStarting off right from the bat is the horrible community. Trolls, griefers, "Bandits" and hackers make up for most of the population as any new player entering the game will be utterly bullied down to the ground without remorse by the veteran players, simply looking to kill some time with a near-infinite amount of hi-tech guns, ammo and bodyarmor, all made by hand. "Testing" phase or not, the percentage alone of people looking to simply ruin the experience for others is stomach sickening and we have the pacing of the game to thank for that which is expanded upon more below.\n\nSecond major issue with this game is how fast you can turn from slapping a rock against a tree to a gun-blazing maniac with hundreds of bullets. All you need is some iron ore, stone and wood, all being open for grabs within the first couple of seconds of playing as slamming your free starting tool against a nearby rock deposit will supply you with 66% of the ingredients, trees (that are everywhere) being the remaining 33% and you're good to go to create weapons that can 1-2 hit any fully-armored newbie player from 25 feet away making the game a thing of deathmatching rather than a case of actual survival against nature and all It's elements & trials since resources are nowhere close to being scarce. I wrecked up about 400 units of metal ore within 2 hours of first setting my foot into the game and that's enough to build over 15+ firearms with ammo to boot considering I also had significant amounts of sulfur (all being harvested from the same, generic rock deposits)  which is a compontent to create gunpowder.\n\nThird problem would be the game mechanics. Glitching through doors & walls is more than a common occurance, leaving most methods of banking extremely unsafe and when player constructions aren't as easy as butter to go through with either hacks or abuse, they are instead utterly impenetrable in the form of having Metal doors (also, very easy to make) that require over 11-15 blank-range hand grenades to be destroyed or 3+ plastic explosives which are one of the most expensive items in the entire game.\n\nThis means you'll not only need some of the most rare recipes there is in order to even be able to break into other people's houses without wooden doors but you also need to grind SIGNIFICANTLY to even have a chance to raid any half-decent base that has more than a single metal door. 3 C4 costs over 900 gunpowder to make (amongst other things) so If you plan to raid a mediocre house with say, 5 metal doors in it (which requires only 1000 metal fragments and some wood), you'll need:\n\n------------\n\n4500 Gunpowder (2250 Charcoal + 2250 Sulfur / 400 Sulfur Ore)\n\n2250 Metal fragments (450~ Metal Ore)\n\n1125 Sulfur (200~ Sulfur Ore)\n\n450 Low-Grade Fuel (900 Animal fat + 450 Cloth)\n\n25 Leather\n\n15 Flares\n\n------------\n\nJust those numbers of supplies will hopefully come across as a lot, even for those of you who haven't even played the game yet. And all of these requirements for C4 makes the alternative of hoarding up on a whole bunch of ammo, building a tower in a populated area and then taking pot-shots to 2-3 hit kill whatever person/newbie that comes within 1-2 miles of range a routine no-brainer time-killing choice for anyone who played the game for more than 6-10 hours on one server. And If you play on a server with decay activated, (which a majority of all servers currently have, about 70-90%) just waiting for someone's house to wither away is a much more viable method than spending days upon days on mindlessly grinding supplies for explosives as can be witnessed by the common scenario of someone raiding with C4 and being laughed at in the global chat due to the cost to gain ratio.\n\nAnd as described vaguely above, there's also a rather dumb rule where you need to find "Blueprints" in order to create anything more advanced than an 9mm pistol/dirty shotguns/cloth armor which you find rarely by looting world-crates and red bears & wolves which are often complete suicide missions for any newbie due to the rampaging deathmatching going on everywhere. But suicide or not, if you do find a blueprint, you can simply "use" it and your character will learn it permanently even through death which may sound like a good idea at first until you realize that every guy who played on the server before you will have an insane, massive advantage with that development decision in place, easily being able to create high-tech body armor and assault rifles as you are constricted to recoil-heavy 9mm's & dirty shotguns while wearing clothed diapers.\n\nOne may argue for a skilled FPS/Survivalist player, this would not be much of an issue.. Except the health & damage system in this game is so depressingly shallow, restricting itself to "Health points" and "Statuses" such as bleed being thrown at you during certain injuries which can instantly be healed by consuming bandages. It's the same disgusting design philosophy seen in games such as The War Z where you can jump around like a complete psycho & hide and wolf down health-kits like nobodies business.\n\nSure, this may seem acceptable at first but when you are facing an overwhelming foe and say, you headshot him 3 times in the head with your 9mm pistol as he ambushes you with an assault rifle from a nearby tower and he still doesnt die but instead rub his buttocks to the left a few inches, healing back to full HP within seconds, there's something seriously wrong with the game. Throw a grenade if you have one you say if they're behind cover? Sorry, but they are completely useless as you require up to 3 consecutive, blank-range exploding grenades to have a chance of killing someone UNARMORED. If they have any range from the explosion impact and armor while healing, you could be talking about tossing 15 of them and still have nothing happen.\n\nFor this game to have ANY hope whatsoever, the developers will need to REALLY re-think a majority of the decisions they've made, be it making guns a RARITY (as there are other ranged weapons like bow & arrow which require actual skill to use) while remaking the method of raiding others or revamping the entire health system completely to have things such as infections, concussions, broken bones and bruising instead of the current, despicable health-kit mouth-absorbing simulator that has no longevity other than mindless grind of ores and certain blueprints while bum-rushing naked to airdrops in hope to get explosives to even have a chance to raid other people's houses which currently litter every inch of the current Rust map before disappearing into thin air rather than having any meaningful player interaction.","December 17, 2013","false","110.3"," 1,483 of 2,102 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","483","2","3","30"

I have had it with this 'Game'.\n\n\nTo be perfectly clear, I have no problem with a game being hard; in fact, I play permadeath games whenever possible, I love the dark souls series, and I only play skyrim with a super difficult and realistic Requiem mod set.\n\nWhat I have a problem with in Rust is the utter lack of anything resembling a community, the chat is constantly filled with some of the most racist and hateful crap that I've ever seen in text form, there almost never seems to be a mod watching chat, the fact that you can spend hours and hours and hours working to make yourself as safe as possible before you log out to use the bathroom, and when you come back, it's all down the toilet...\n\nThis was a total waste of my money and for the first time ever, I'm going to search for a way to permanently remove 'Rust' from my games list. This crap is why I used to torrent games before buying them.\n\n-10/10 (I've never given a game a negative score before)\n\n\nP.S. a few more things; (will edit as I think of them)\n\n1. Even though I have a 1,400 dollar PC that is only 1 year old,AND running game boosting software, I have to run Rust on absolute minimum settings just to not lag ALL the time. even still, the wildlife tends to clip through mountains and run up and down 80' slopes like the frigging roadrunner.\n\n2. Every update seems to halve my Framerate even further while not actually seeming to provide anything useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n******EDIT: After thinking about it, I'me going to try a foriegn server. One where English is likely not spoken often. Hopefully by doing this I can evade the 'hate chat' and maybe by building my house in the middle of nowhere and build it very small, I can stay below a hackers notice?... sigh... I spent good money on this, and I WANT to like it.... Ging to give it another shot...\n\n\n\n*****2ND EDIT:   Tried it again, received some VERY rare kindness from a fellow with a house near mine. Paid it forward by supplying a noob with useful tips and basic tool and food, made a secure stone home, logged for the night, and was house hacked AGAIN and locked inside with no way to escape or respawn or kill myself or anything.\n\nMy initial review was done in the heat of the moment and I was rather upset at the time, but I'm crystal clear now and stand by everything I said previously. I gave Rust its second chance. Rust ♥♥♥♥ed me over and I will NOT be giving it a third chance unless my friends tell me that every single hacker was BANNED from the game( not likely).\n\n\n*****EDIT TO RESPOND TO ALL CURRET COMMENTS:       To the people saying that I'm just a crappy player, that's relative and has nothing to do with the performance problems, the lack of trust, the lack of anything social beyond someone trying to tell me that they wont hurt me but still trying to stab me with a spear, etc.\n\nTo the people saying that hackers mostly arnt a problem, I tried playing on around 8 or 9 different servers with the same EXACT problems on all of them.\n\nTo the people saying that i wasn't actually hacked, but people were beating down a wall/door/ whatever and boarding me back in. I already knew about that and I find that difficult to believe could happen in the time it took to log out for a bathroom break(less than 1 minute most of the time, not that you particularly needed to know that).There were 2 or 3 times that I suspect that DID happen since the new door/wall was wood and not the upgraded stone, but those times were when I was gone overnight. i DID build small and i DID build fast and I tried to find the most desolate and hidden places to build. I never set a fire at night and tried not to kill anyone so as to NOT give away that I was even there in the first place. I also played on the LEAST populated servers. I would STILL have people 'SOMEHOW' getting into and back out of my upgraded and trapped home in under 2 minutes. it was friggin ridiculous.\n\n\n\nAs far as my computer stuff goes, I'll try the nvidia control panel stuff the next time I have a similar problem with a game, I have no desire to try it now, but I'll keep it in mind :)\n\n\none last bit...directed towards anyone having a problem with me using torrented games to test drive games when deciding what to buy. consider that big games nowadays cost around 50-60 bucks. who in their right mind is going to simply lay that cash down on a game that they dont know they'll like? if ALL games have a decent demo and you could KNOW that you wouldnt be dissapointed by Galactic Civ 3(since it feels like clone of GC2 with somewhat better graphics and a repetetive ground combat system.), then would you put your cash on a game that you torrented/demo'd and KNOW you'll like? or would you risk it on one that you had to rely on reviews for?","May 24, 2015","false","20.6"," 298 of 410 people (73%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","73","298","410","49","22"

With your rock you painstakingly knock a tree over, and crush a boulder into little pebbles, which you then fashion into a hatchet.  You use your hatchet to craft yourself a bow in order to hunt game.  You use your bow to take down a wild boar, which you then cook over a campfire.  You use the leather from the boar to fashion some makeshift clothing to protect you from the cold.  You smile, knowing that based on your intellect and hard labour you have managed to fashion a respectable existence for yourself on this forsaken island.\n\nThen the same guy with the submachine gun shows up and one-shots you.\n\nYou respawn on another beach with nothing but a rock and a torch.  You gather your wits about you and retrace your steps.  Soon you once again have a hatchet, a bow, and a large pile of wood.  You get to work on building a home for yourself so that you will have shelter to protect yourself from the elements, and so that if you die you don't have to start over from the very beginning.  You carefully set down a foundation, and then build walls.  Soon, all that remains is to put the door in place, and your new home will be complete.\n\nThen the same guy with the submachine gun shows up and you fall to the ground in a hail of bullets.  As you roll around screaming on the ground, he pulls out the very same bow you crafted in your second life and delivers the coup de grace.\n\nYou respawn on a beach.

You knock on the door, and submachine gun guy, the new owner of your house, pops out and murders you.\n\nIn a rage, you respawn on yet another beach, with nothing but a rock and torch.  Furiously you knock over a tree with your rock, retrace your footsteps, and about two hours later, you finally have a house of your own.  You gather stones and solidify the walls.  You create a furnace and start smelting metal, which you then use to strengthen the walls.  You gather blueprints for advanced weaponry and armour, and soon are kitted out in the very best protection that exists.  After three days of this, your home is now a fortress, daring anyone to test your mettle.\n\nArmed with your rifle, you set out in search of submachine gun guy.  There is hell to pay.

When you return, he flies out of the building and rains bullets from the sky, ending your life.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/252490/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOverview:Rust may seem just another average, run-of-the mill multiplayer survival early access title you see pop up on Steam every now and then, and for the most part, you'd be right. However, seeing the vast community that Rust has managed to put together, and seeing it on sale, I decided to give it a go, and boy, do I have a tale to tell! This game is both good, great, and horrible at the same time. Keep reading to understand why.\nWorth Noting: I won't talk about really specific things as they are always subject to change. This will be a review of the overall experience you will get out of the game.\n\nThe Pros:Great Maps - Each server has it's own procedural map (which you can see here[playrust.io]) and it is pretty huge. Plenty of nice landscapes, biomes and landmarks to explore. With different spreading of resources and rare goods spots.\n\nPowerful Crafting - Crafting is intuitive, takes time to do, and offers many items to choose from, and even more to risk your life gathering ingredients for. Brings the balance between a sandbox builder and shooter. Building your base is also a pleasant experience once you've gathered the resources.\n\nThe Social Aspect - If you don't have friends that play rust, you're pretty much doomed if you can't join a clan or small group. Rust is ruthless, with players jumping at each-others' necks for survival. You will be hunted, harassed, and you are expected to do the same, lest you risk being killed yourself. Teamwork and lack of trust in strangers are emphasized and crucially important here.\n\nIntense fights! - When people get greedy, they tend to rely on others to do the hard work for them. Enter raiding bases, and defending your own. If you happen to be online when you are attacked, raids are blood-pumping, scary, but also tons of fun, no matter on which side of the wall you are. Guns, crossbows and explosives everywhere!\n\nStrategy Based - Rust rewards brain over brawn. If you can make a good base design, place your home somewhere strategic, kill enemies from cover, or even deceive them, trap them etc. brings a whole world of rewards and will keep you alive for longer than flailing your assault rifle.\n\nBi-weekly Updates - Even though this game has been in Alpha for 2 years now, updates are rolling in about two times a week, and it's nice to see a steady development flow. Still, it may be unfinished for a long time, but definitely playable nonetheless.\n\nModded Servers - Want to freebuild? Want to get all resources and just focus on killing? There are a lot of community hosted servers with mods just for that!\nThe Cons:Ruthless! - Every one will try to kill you on sight, no questions asked. Everyone will try to raid your base, even though you just started. You will end up entering the game only to find everything you had stolen and your based turned to ruins. I myself with a group of 3 other friends just lost 50 hours of playtime each to an overnight raid, which brings me to my next point:\n\nRaiding is too easy! - Once you get your hands on a few C4 and / or rockets, raiding becomes too easy to perform and too hard to defend against. In order to have a well defended base, you will need to sacrifice actual inside room, if you want to actually be able to build it. Offline raiding (attacking once the players are offline) is also sadly available. You may have lookout towers and a lot of guns. But with no one to operate them, you will lose 100%.\n\nBuilding Sucks! - I said it's fun, and it is, but in order to combat abuse, you are only allowed to remove structures you placed 10 minutes after you place them. If you notice a mistake, or if you want to expand the building and say, replace a wall with a door, then tough luck, buddy! You'll have to raid your own base. So, start small, think in advance, stack resources and only build once you know what you want!\nConclusion:I recommend this game. It's fun, and it's frustrating, but it's fun because it is frustrating. Don't be afraid to lose, and try to have fun! This game is great with friends, and it has a very large community built around it!\n\nEarly Access Disclaimer:As with all Early Access titles I review, I urge the reader to consider that this is an unfinished product and it can change for the best or for the worst during development. Unless you are happy about the current state of the game, or want to support the developers, then do not purchase this game. You run the risk of not liking it later / being abandoned, and you will have only yourself to blame.\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

From what I know, this game had something going in its previous incarnation, now called Legacy. That is no longer the case.\n\nIt took no expense of time for me to realize that Rust is a prime contributor to the disgustingly lucrative business of perpetual alpha, money-grubbing early access survival games. They are very efficient at exciting the imaginations of customers with the prospect of what "could" be without ever fulfilling that potential.\n\nRust was actually very fun at first. I got so caught up in building my stuff and trying to set up my survival regime that I pulled an all-nighter building a large forest complex seated atop and around a big rock. There were some dumb things going on along the way, like my walls getting destroyed by guys with shotguns and non-responsive wildlife that teleports short distances.\n\nHowever, as you can see by my invested play time, that fun did not last. I returned to the game the next day to find that the entire complex I spent over 12 hours building had vanished and random chunks were left floating around. After inquiring about it in the global chat, I learned that Rust's servers cant even handle its own infrastructure. My forest complex had been destroyed by the game itself, which apparently struggled just to allocate where things go and failed miserably. Aside from the plethora of issues that I consistently experienced with connecting to the game, Rust's servers have to be wiped out completely several times per month just to avert their inevitable destabilization.\n\nThe aforementioned glitchiness of the wildlife was also attributed to the game's servers and poor script. Further compounding this madness is the decimation of your framerate that occurs near concentrations of objects or light sources regardless of how powerful your graphics card is.\n\nA game that is six months into development after its reboot cant even handle the basic stress of having player-created constructs across the map. Mind you, the game's map is bare-bones aside from grass, rocks, water, and resources. Given this, I'm supposed to believe that Rust is going to somehow become a finished, fully functional sandbox game with full terrain and even more complex multiplayer features?\n\nI could go on and on about what's wrong with Rust's gameplay, which isn't even a bad thing. It's an alpha and flaw is to be expected. The game obviously still needs a lot of refinement and that's okay. It's another matter entirely when the rudimentary infrastructure of the game is ♥♥♥-backwards, volatile, and unstable. I'd cut this game some slack if its total development time through Legacy and its current incarnation didn't span several years.\n\nTo put it simply, this game is in ♥♥♥♥-poor condition given the circumstances. It may look pretty, and it may seem promising, but it's just another siren singing you to your demise. Rust is built on asinine coding, upheld by unstable servers, and can barely limp into functionality after an unreasonably long development cycle. It's quite clear that the developers don't give a rat's ♥♥♥ about accomplishing whatever dreams were put forth in Rust. They've made the money they wanted by whispering sweet nothings into your ear and now lack the incentive to fulfill their end, despite very strong support from the community.\n\nI wanted to like Rust but it did a great job of disappointing me in a very short time.\n\nDon't buy this piece of ♥♥♥♥ excuse of a game. Unless you'd like to run around with a shotgun and repeatedly murder players who are powerless to stop you, steal their belongings, and blast their homes into oblivion, then start all over in a few days, because that is the epitome of the experience Rust has to offer you.","January 5, 2015","false","24.7"," 394 of 563 people (70%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","70","394","563","20","15"

It is up to the developers to see that potential. Currently in alpha state Rust is filled with PVP and raiders/looters. True, the game is meant to be survival, but they are not raiding to survive. They are doing so out of boredom, for the lulz, and to ♥♥♥♥ people off.\n\nAs it stands I do not recommend Rust in its current state and only time will tell if the developers attempt to foster cooperative gameplay or nurture the gankfest.\n\nUPDATE: As the game originally released as the Early Access version is being rebuilt from the ground up my older review might not be accurate.

You awaken to see a field, there are deer and other creatures walking around.  A tiny chicken struts by as your vision becomes more clear... next to it you notice a rock. You pick up this rock and stare at it intensely, it becomes your new best friend. You stand up with rock in hand and realize... you're in the post-apocalyptic world. You look into the distance to see the remains of civilization. Where did the grand cities go? Where are the roads and people? Where are your pants?\n\nYou continue to look around in a daze, holding your rock close. You decide you cannot sit around any longer, and start walking forward. You head forwards a road you spotted earlier. On your way to the road, you notice a pile of wood. You run towards it, smashing it with your rock. Wood falls beneath your feet. You eat it. You continue to walk, now noticing a big, shiny rock. You repeat the same process. You now have a supply of wood, rocks, and metal fragments. You wonder what you can do with those. As you get lost in thought, you realize you've made it to the road, but something is wrong... Bears and wolves with a red coat start chasing you. You run at high speeds, swinging your rock in defense... Is this the end?\n\nYou continue to defend yourself, realizing your rock has betrayed you. It does not affect the crazed animals. You continue to run, but they will not stop. You strain your eyes and see something ahead, a shelter! You seem to have no stamina so you sprint to this shelter for protection from the animals. The shelter is a cluster of buildings, seeming to be an old town... you're overwhelmed with joy as you notice the animals giving up, wait though... You feel dizzy, sick, and odd... You realize you're getting radiation poisoning!\n\nThis will not be the end. You see boxes inside your shelter, you run to them and dig... you're lucky! There are rad-pills! You take these pills and instantly feel better... you abandon the town and continue down the road. You start feeling a cold sensation, you realize... it is turning night. You hurry into the mountains to build your first home to survive the night. As you climb, you slip... and fall. You break your kankles. As you're injured you lay in agony, wondering if this is how your life will end... 5 seconds later you recover and continue ahead.\n\nYou make it to the top, overlooking the lush landscape. You cough up your wood from earlier and mold it into the shape of a shelter, and you place it into the dirt below. You walk inside, building a campfire to stay warm... as you fall asleep. You suddenly wake up to the sound of gunshots.... Where could these come from? How? Isn't everyone living like cavemen? You realize this is a very bad sign and decide to leave your shelter behind and run for your life.\n\nYou will not stop running. You run, and run, and run... until you find a backpack. You stare at it in awe... and cannot contain yourself. You open up the backpack, and pull out a saliva covered rock, with a stick tied to it... it looks alot like a hatchet. You take it and run into the distance, your primal instincts telling you to hit more wood piles and big rocks... and so you follow your instincts.\n\nYou slap, and slap, and slap all the resources you see in sight. Something is very wrong though, you realize you're starving to death. You must find food fast! You run into the woods and see a boar. You run towards the boar, brutally beating it to death with your hatchet. As you gather food from it, you realize it is fresh, raw, chicken meat. You eat it raw, not remembering how to function like a normal human being, and you throw up for hours... What has your life come to?\n\nYou finally recover from your sickness. Now you will cook this "chicken" you have obtained. You spit up all of the rocks you've collected so far, stack them and create a beautiful furnace. You lay the slab of meat inside, and let it cook on a rock. 3 minutes later, it is finished and ready to eat. You bite into it and it is the best piece of grilled chicken you've had in a week. Life is looking wonderful now!\n\nYou now feel fantastic! You're ready to build a home. You take the wood you've gathered, and mold it into one piece at a time... stairs, doors, foundations, walls, everything. When you finish these pieces, you stack them... and make a magnificent house! You put all of your belongings you've collected over the last day into a box in the corner on your new house. You're now ready... to go fight the red animals.\n\nYou run out, with your junk waving around, and your hatchet high into the sky... you feel overwhelmed with joy. As you're running towards the army of red animals, you hear a funny sound... you feel very strange... a hot sensation comes over you, as you reach for your head... you grab an arrow that has now become your unicorn horn. You realize your life is now in danger. You try to run, as more arrows fly at you. What will happen to you now?\n\nYou haven't made it far, and you see a man wearing full black. You feel saved. He starts shooting the naked, crazed men behind you. You're life is no longer in danger. He says hello to you, and you say hello back. Is this a new friendship? ...No. You were mistaken. He holds up a gun, and sticks it into your face. He demands your rock. You want to save your life, so you give up your precious rock... and it is the last thing you'd do. "Thank you for the rock, now I'll be going." he says as he shoots you in the face. As you fall over, you throw up a backpack and fade into the black... You have a feeling you will get revenge in the future...\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...\n\n...Next time on Rust...\nYou see a man in the distance,  it does not feel so lonely out here anymore. He reminds you alot of yourself. He has a rock, has no clothes, and looks exactly like you... What will you do? You have a gun in your hands... You feel the primal urges again, what will happen to this poor, naked creature?\n\nTHE FINAL VERDICT: Rust is one of my favorite games and I highly recommended this game! Though it has its flaws, some of those flaws are what makes Rust the amazing game it is! What other game can you get chicken from each and every animal? What other game do you fight with rocks... for more rocks? Rust is amazing! Alot of these flaws will be fixed though, because Rust is still in alpha. If you're okay with the story above becoming true events, then you should buy Rust! I give Rust 9/10 rocks, and chicken breasts.","October 26, 2014","true","227.5"," 139 of 183 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","139","183","0","13"

Rust Legacy, though it was buggy and rough around the edges, was incredibly fun. The community was not nearly as bad as the new Rust. Some of the best times I've ever had in any multiplayer game were spent in Rust Legacy. I miss it.\n\nThe developers have added little new content to the game in its nearly 3 year Alpha development. Instead, they have highlighted and refined features in the new Rust that brings out the worst in its community. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why the new Rust that strips away many "survival" aspects and turns it into a cancerous FPS. With hackers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s running wild, the game is nearly unplayable unless you play with a group. There is no cooperation. It's 100% KOS. You will die and lose everything as soon as you log out.\n\nThere isn't a clear direction for the game, either. Most of the dev updates are bug fixes here and there, new buyable in-game items and textures, and petty things. The anti-cheat system is practically useless. The optimization is terrible. The community is - saying it again because I cannot stress it enough - absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing horrendous.\n\nThere are a few good things to say about the game, though. For one, the graphics are quite nice if you have a high-end PC that manage to run it on high graphics settings. The building system is also pretty good, though Legacy's was better. The maps are huge and procedurally generated (if that's your thing - personally, I preferred Legacy's predetermined map much better).\n\nI don't regret buying it because of the many wonderful hours (over 200 if you count the hours from my previous account) I spent in Rust Legacy. However, I cannot recommend the current version. This game is dead to me.","March 24","false","72.1"," 280 of 396 people (71%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","71","280","396","17","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RogueSpectre/recommended/252490/","RogueSpectre","RogueSpectre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RogueSpectre/","166 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRust is such an interesting game. It's a very original concept, having to survive from literally nothing, and building yourself and your clan up to be the strongest in the server. Only, there's several major problems with this game, and that's why I can't reccomend it.\n\nConcept: Like I said, when I first started the game, I loved the concept, from nothing to riches and power. However, when you get into the specifics, there's really no end game. You either build yourself up enough to be strong and not be radied (boring) or, you become the raiders (which almost always stops being for fun and turns ugly and volitile.) So essentially, this game unintentionally breeds a bad community. Also, there are far more chances to lose than their are to win. You either are the strongest and don't get raided, or work constantly only to lose your stuff to a group of people who spend more time in this game. Time + Group = Win. Nothing else works.\n\nCommunity: The community in this game is, frankly, horrible. It's kind of a domino effect - new player sees a group, group kills him on sight, --> new player learns that game is about getting a group together and killing on sight. It's gotten to the point where maybe 1 in 15 people I see in this game do not kill me on sight, even after stating I'm friendly.\n\nDevelopers: This is probably one of the main issues with the game, and surprisingly, it's not something I see adressed often in reviews. To me, development of this game has halted. For a game that's reportedly in "early alpha" for over 2 years, the last thing players want to see is the devs changing the size of rocks and plants and calling that an update. My defintion of developing a game, espcially one that is in "early alpha" is adding new mechanics, not tweaking already existing things in the game. This game follows the same exact formula of the piles and piles of steam games which have been abandoned half developed, but I'm sure there always will be hopefuls to tell you differently, there always are.\n\nThere's also a hacking problem which the developers are trying as hard as they can to ignore. The addition of anti cheat didn't seem to change a thing.\n\nOverall: This game is conceptually flawed, failed from the beginning. The devs had an amazing idea, but failed to fix the specifics, and the game slowly descended into madness from there. While some people may have a fun time playing this game, the foresight that I have, that there is literally no end-game, makes any time or effort I spend on this game abolutely futile.","April 8","false","64.5"," 204 of 283 people (72%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","72","204","283","10","5"

Constant updates, and a good community! Overall, I would rate this game 8/10 and definitely recommend it to others!\nNow, I shall tell a story!\n-Once upon a time, there were these 3 naked men who found M4 rifles and killed everyone within sight. One day, these 3 men decided to kill some annoying child whom was spamming their mic. (We) went and took over his base, finding many resources and, yet another, M4 rifle. We went and found another trustworthy person to base with us. We decided not to kill everyone, only people who were stacked with gear and were killing everyone. We helped a few newbies out and built our base. I chose to build it under a rock cliff so it would look like a cave. While building, we noticed this small crack since there wasn't enough room for another wall. I stuck a barricade (very weak) to keep intruders out. The micspamming kid found our base, and got hackers to kill us. They didn't know that we had beds to respawn in there with. We respawned, got our gear, and started improving the base. They couldn't get in since we had good walls (and didn't notice the barricade). Then, the kid came back with some n00bs claiming they had C4 to break in our base. The chopped and chopped with their rocks at the door, and we just kept building walls behind it so they couldn't get in. Then, they left to go get gunpowder, so we went out the secret exit to get resources. We needed to craft bullets. One at a time, we went outside, making sure it was safe. One guy fell off the cliff and died. The other was mauled by a bear. It was down to me and one other guy. We got all the resources and returned to the base, rebuilding the barricade. We crafted and shared all the bullets. The next day, we were all laughing when that kid came back. I told one friend to break the barricade while I distracted. Then, we all jumped on top of the cliff and reigned fire upon the kid's army. One of or men were shot by friendlies in the crossfire. But then, all of the enemy was defeated. We did it! We returned into the base, went and picked up the fallen ally and returned his gear to him.\n-\nThis game is an amazing game!

From there you try to gather as many resources as you can. This is a game in which resources are key so acquiring them by any means necessary is fair game. Yes, that means you can kill the guy farming a tree for 5 minutes and take all his hard work. Or you can be killed by a guy while you're farming and subsequently lose all your hard work...or kill the guy farming then get killed by another guy. That is why you always want to use move around and look around while farming. To make sure you do not lose all of your resources, you must invest them into making a house. No house is ever 100% secure as enough explosives will break through just about anything. Clans are difficult to fight, but nothing is stopping you from gaining their trust, and then completely destroying them from the inside out. There is no such thing as "morally wrong" in Rust. You do what you must to survive, and survive what you must to continue doing so.\n\nAs for progress, how much have you hoarded so far and how many blueprints have you learned? The more you have learned - the more you have progressed. Eventually you will have all the blueprints studied - and you will have nothing better to do. At this point most clans just start wars with each other - this is the type of stuff you see in Raid cams. On most vanilla servers you will have blueprint wipe cycles the first of every month so all your blueprint progress is reset- and map wipes weekly or every two weeks whereas the map is cleaned of all houses and sleepers, without touching players' blueprint progress.  If you fancy permanent blueprint progression, less grinding or any other variation on normal gameplay - you are always free to play on modded servers that each offer their own mix of mods.\n\nThis game can be very unforgiving, but it is ultimately up to the player to decide whether or not they will persevere through the hardships and turn the tides of battle to their favor.","November 4, 2015","true","358.1"," 61 of 71 people (86%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","86","61","71","12","0"

In greater detail my experince was quite an amazing one right up until about 5 months into the life-span of the game, that is of course when the hackers pretty much took over the servers and ruined the game for everybody. During that time there was no real implemented of a anti-cheat but it was heavly being worked on from what we heard, so the only real engagement with the hackers were admins and thier powers, and my gosh that got out of hand too, those who got punked on by cheaters would host thier own servers and abuse admin powers. But I stuck with Rust from day 1, just trying to play the damn game, getting rekkt by hackers everyday losing gear and building supplys having to find a new server every 5 weeks.\n\nThat is all until CheatPunch, the anti-cheat they had been working on for so long! Yes finally!(little did I know...)\nYou might be wondering did the hackers go away?   No.\nDid the slow down or atleat stop coming?    Ha, not at all.\nWere Admins starting to use powers and not abuse?  It got worse!\nDid the Devs do anything to fix it? Not a damn thing.\nWas the anti-cheat tested? I don't believe it was.\nDid it help anything? Help me see I wasted $20\n\nInfact the anti-cheat is such garbage I got wrongfully banned in the Alpha/Legacy and can no longer play Rust, I thought there must be a mistake and e-mailed FacePunch. After waiting and waiting and emailing several other devs I was told that they can't/won't do anything for me and to buy a new copy on a new steam account. Lol. Right.\n\nAfter 550+ hours and a hard belif that Garry knew what he was doing because Gmod turned out so well,\ngotta wake up and smell the coffee, nobody makes games like they used to.\n\nWish I never bought this one.","June 18, 2015","false","552.3"," 171 of 241 people (71%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","71","171","241","24","19"

We decide to find each other by heading towards the setting sun. A long 20 minutes roll by when we finaly find each other. We decide to go try kill a deer. On our aproach a man shows up and says "Hello. What are you guys doing?" "We are hunting this deer". Togethor with the stranger we manage to corner the deer off. Apon finally killing it the man pulls out a shotgun and shoots me in the face then wounds my friend before he runs out of ammo. My friend managed to escape.\nNow we had to find each other again. Apon my journey, I found a road which I promptly followed to the west. I found a small shelter which had a few supplies, 2 tins of tuna and a radiation suit. I Headed off further toward my destination, when a man aproached heading east, I had already learned not to trust any man. He worryingly said "sir do you have any food to spare I am in desperate need of it". I threw 1 tin at him then ran on my way. I eventualy found my friend further down the path. The sun was still high but we knew we didn't have long to spare before night would be apon us. We decided to collect resources to build a small encampment to wait out the night. We had all our supplies at the ready and headed into the mountains to find some cover from wondering bandits. Apon climbing into the mountain not too far we found an abandon hut. It was in a state of disrepair. We decided to fix it up for the night and make it home. Once we had put up all the wall's and door's we noted there was a window they may be reachable with a well timed jump from a near by boulder. We thought nothing of it and set up our bed rolls to wait out the night. Later on as our fire grew low my friend decided it'd be best if he stepped out into the darkness to fetch some more logs for the fire. He opened his door then promtly shut it. "Theres a man outside the door" "Quickly put out the fire". We hid in the corner as we waited silently. I took a peek out the window and there he was. Standing atop the boulder. He turned his torch on, so I quickly ducked from sight. We hid in the corner waiting in horror for what may come. He started circling the cabern, we could see his torch shinning through the cracks in the wood. then another torch appeared. and started making the rounds also. Then I heard "Thanks for the can of food earlier" "No problem" I replied, then threw some more meat out the window as an offereing. "Please go away" my friend stated. We waited. The torches disappeared. We waited...... The torches lit up on top of the boulder out the window. We waited. They jumped... We ran at them with our crude stone axes and they mowed us down with guns blazing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmurfstomper/recommended/252490/","thesmurfstomper","Smurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmurfstomper/","112 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI am seeing a lot of negative reviews on this game and I wanted to shed some light to people on the fence about buying this game. I have over 500 hours of gameplay at the moment and I am still currently playing it. This game is a hardcore survival game and I do mean hardcore. Most people you encounter will in fact kill you, even if you are a fresh spawn carrying a rock. However, it's in game voip allows you to communicate with others and I have actually talked my way out of being murdered and my precious rock being stolen  This game is a mix between DayZ and Minecraft. You can farm wood and ore and build up a base and fortify it. You can also craft weapons, gear, explosives and raid other bases and kill people. The reason why I can't give the current version of Rust a 10 is because 1.) Servers rubber band sometimes which makes it a struggle to line up a good shot on people. 2.) They should update it more often. (I know they are rebuilding a new version from scratch at the moment and it's alright so far. There are some bugs like going up up stairs.). 3.) This game can be played solo but it really is built for group play. That being said I have played at least 2/3 of my hours alone and still had a blast. Overall, this game is a time sink and you will be looking at the clock wondering where the time went. If you are a hardcore surival fan. The new version barely has any hackers from what I can tell. So they have fixed that so far.\n\n\nIt's at Alpha but the game already has a decent playable content and a huge player base. Developers are pretty active and they give news about new implementations every week but the updates still take time.\n\n\nPersonally, I love this game. I have given it only 8.5/10 for several reasons though which I will list below.\nThere is a huge learning curve that accompanies this game, for the first hour or so you may be completely confused on how to play, but that is the same with most games. If you do figure out how to get started quickly, it can take you maybe 30 minutes to get well established with a house etc.  This game is very dependent on a number of factors, including server, friends, and overall attitude.\n\nSome servers that you get on in the game have a hacker. Mostly large servers. It is sometimes a challenge to find a server with good staffing and admins, but once you do, this problem is almost non-existent. If you continue to have issues with it, do some research to find a good server, and try to befriend an admin or two so you know when they are on.\n\nThis game is also very heavily group-based. If you find yourself a good set of friends to play with, it deters a lot of people from attacking you, as well as making starting off easier. Try to find some people to play with and your game play will increase tenfold.\n\nI also put attitude here, because you have to be okay with dying. If you have a problem with that it's not the game for you. People try to kill you. That's it. The game is kill or be killed, or hide long enough to get settled. If you cannot get started easily, try to find a friend or two to play with and it makes dying not as unbearable. Also, the friendlier you are to others, the friendlier they will be back to you (usually), with this in mind you can make allies and trade with others, but it all depends on what your mindset in-game is.\n\nThis game is not for people accustomed to being spoon-fed by developers. Read that twice, so it sticks. This game is not for people accustomed to being spoon-fed by developers. Read that twice, so it sticks.\n\nRaiding, defending, gathering, animal - hunting, the paranoia of not knowing other player's intentions, Rust will make you feel like you're a survivor. Or it will send you crying back to games where you're told where to go, what to do, and when to do it.\n\n\nEnjoy.","May 30, 2015","true","595.2"," 53 of 60 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","53","60","3","1"

It started as one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had, followed by the absolute worst experience I've ever had. Let me explain.\n\nRust "Legacy" (the version previous) was a very fun survival game. You had basic loot gathering, a map that took some time to memorize, base building, base raiding, fun PVP combat, crafting, etc. It was not a perfect game, but being "Early Access", it was easily the best purchase I made in 2014. And then the new "experimental" version was rolled out.\n\nThe developers decided to completely scrap the old engine and do a rewrite from the ground up. I am a developer and I can appreciate this mindset. However, the new version of Rust is a far cry from what it used to be. The new procedural generated map is a cool idea but it is so incredibly bland. Combat is weird. There are no base raiding mechanics in place other than shooting a player's door down (they've reimplemented raiding with C4). Basic UI features are missing. The new version is an absolute mess and is not very fun at all.\n\nA new player looking at the reviews in Steam may be misled into buying it because of the "Very Positive" rating it currently holds. BE WARNED - Most of those positive reviews are for LEGACY. You can still play the Legacy version but it is now unmaintained and riddled with hackers and the experience just isn't the same. There is also a very large exploit which allows players to get into bases without having to raid and it is widely abused.\n\nIt was borderline irresponsible for the developers to push out the old version so quickly and alienate their fanbase. I get that the game is "Early Access" and still has a way to go, but they took a step in the wrong direction and I doubt they will be able to get back to what made this game so special.\n\nEdit on 3/17/2015: raiding is now in place. Game still not as fun as legacy.","January 22, 2015","false","669.8"," 112 of 152 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","112","152","0","2"

Its just like that.\nbut for more detail...\nGood Game, Good Idea, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community. For example here is the prey chain in rust: You spawn, you have one rock, you kill another fresh spawn for their rock, someone kills you for your two rocks, they then have three rocks, then someone kills them for their three rocks, they then have four rocks, then someone kills them for their four rocks, then the guy with five rocks runs to get wood, then the guy with five rocks is instakilled by someone with a bow. The guy with a bow, burlap clothes, and six rocks gathers wood, Guy with bow, clothes, and six rocks, gathers a rock, the guy with bow, clothes, six rocks, some wood and some stone, is shot by guy with bolt action rifle. The guy with seven rocks a gun and the other guys clothing, logs out for the night. Seven other guys with bolt action rifles break into his house. Steal all his rocks and stuff. Those guys (a clan) contiune to prey on everyone else. My advice: dont buy this game unless you have a group of friends to play with. If you are trying to gain respect, show them your giant rock collection (of the early cycle if you got out). Then respawn cause they killed you for your twenty seven rocks. This game may actually instill you with extreme trust issues that carry on to real life. You may be in the hall way walking to class or a meeting, but the guy behind you IS planning to kill you with his book/breifcase/rock, you just dont know it yet.

The better you understand that no one or nothing is truly safe anywhere, the more relaxed your play through will be.\n\nThe game is updated on a regular basis, and this version is already smooth to play.

One of the best open-world, sandbox-style games I've ever seen. But the 5% of bad is really a game-breaker.\n\nI understand that this is Alpha and will be sticking it out hoping these things get improved. In detail: I LOATHE the lack of protection for logging out. This game penalizes you for sleeping, working, or doing anything else IRL. To be successful in this game you would literally need to replace your real life with it. When you log out you face-plant on the ground much like in the movie "Avatar" - leaving your body and everything you're carrying vulnerable to anyone who can get to you. I support that there is no way to completely defend your base from raiders and would never ask for that to be changed, but it is utterly soul-crushing to start with absolutely nothing every time you log in.\n\nI understand that this was implemented to prevent "combat-logging", however there are other games that have already solved this problem. Things such as log-out timers have been implemented for ages. Create an active timer counting down from 2 minutes (or another arbitrary time value) and have the character disappear after that time. Provide the same static wait time upon a d/c/alt+f4.\n\nTLDR: Though I love the old-school style punishments for failure this game is TOO punishing. Don't expect to be successful unless you can LITERALLY live within it's world.\n\nP.S.\nAs a secondary minor issue, metal is far too rare given how important it is to the game. More spawns, or ability to pick at mountains the way we pick at trees.","December 17, 2013","false","114.8"," 86 of 114 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","86","114","0","3"

Speedhacking, flying, teleporting, spawning thousands of c4 in to lag the server out, spawning with the best imaginable gear, god moded players who leap all around the map and kill all players as fast as possible, when that becomes tiring they simply ddos the server and make it crash, Stay in your home? it'll get blown up and everything that you worked for is gone, Hackers will frequently teleport inside kill you and blow everything you had up. Leave to get supplies? same thing, Log off for the night? expect to log back in with the same thing. Try to hide from them? good luck they know where you are at all times, kill you through solid objects rocks metal walls ect. wanna fight back? expect to only be shot in the head via aimbots\n\nThe worst thing of all is the producers have not even awknowledged that this is a problem and have done absolutely nothing to help (besides the case of all servers being ddos'd at once,\n\nSteam anticheat? if you like players banned only after several months of continually doing this then go right ahead and keep telling yourself it works\n\nHackers banned?

It is as if, having bailed on another zombie game, they attempted to convert a sandbox game into a free-for-all deathmatch. You will be killed for virtually no reason at any time and then insulted over public chat for daring to suggest this might not be very fun for you.\n\nBut 1200 hours, you say? Well, yes, when Rust first emerged it was challenging yet after a medium learning curve was manageable. I stop in for a few hours every month, and I am less and less impressed. The "game" itself continues to improve... and yet is less and less fun every time I play. Expect to spend upwards of 20 hours gathering resources over and over, only to be murdered for them. Expect another 20 trying to find "blueprints" (The new "spin" to try to reenage players with this garbage heap) and then not finding anything useful, literally having to suicide to get a new rock to mine more rock. Sound fun? Maybe if your choice is between this and Flappy Bird, yeah.\n\nRust is rapidly becoming what WoW became: Trolling children, homophobic insults and ranting, and new players being abused and crushed for the enjoyment of the people who are "regulars". Id beg for a refund if game developers (In particular, Garry) weren't greedy self-important narcissists.\n\n0/10\nSave your money. Get a coffee for some homeless guy.

My hunger meter was fine, but I'd feel better if I knew I had some rations to fall back on as I travelled.\n\nI decided to walk off and get my bearings while my chicken cooked, taking a quick stroll around the area. I stopped to admire the view of the plains in front of me, the way the grass swayed. The orange tinted sky would have made it look even more beautiful, had I not had the settings on low.\n\nDamn FPS.\n\nI turned back towards my temporary resting spot, surprised to hear a man growling over voice chat, "This my chicken!"\n\nHe'd already seen me. And he'd attempted to steal my food.\n\nI yelled at him to back away and pulled my hatchet free, strafing around him as I approached.\n\n"This my chicken boy, I'm takin' it!" The naked man rushed at me, raising the rock he was gripping tightly in his hands. "MY CHICKEN!"\n\nWe exchanged blows, the rock doing little damage in comparison to my sharp blade. As he crumpled in a bloody heap, I whispered "I win" as I scavenged his backpack.\n\nHe'd had a stone hatchet, why hadn't he equipped it? No matter. I took my chicken and his hatchet and went on my way. Not but ten seconds later did I see a man being chased by a wolf, obviously helpless. I yelled that I'd help him, sprinting after the wolf and swinging the hatchet down into its back.\n\nOnce he realized I wasn't trying to attack him, he turned and began to bash the startled wolf with his rock. Within seconds it fell.\n\n"You can have the stuff the wolf drops," I told him as I turned and began sprinting away. I didn't trust him and thought for a moment he might chase after to attack, but I felt a small bit of glee when I heard his voice faintly over VOIP. "Wow, thanks bro!"\n\nUnfortunately, this is where I ran face first into a bear.\n\nFortunately, it didn't detect me. At first. I felt irony wash over me as I switched positions with the man I'd saved-- but I knew his rock wasn't going to cut it. I'd just have to make Usain Bolt proud and sprint away.\n\nThe sun was starting to set, and I could hear the heavy steps of the bear behind me. It was dead set on catching me. If I didn't lose it soon, it would likely catch me as I stumbled around in the darkness.\n\n"I was checking his steam profile and.." What was that?! Oh hell- I'd run right near someones house. I could hear two men chatting inside, and while I feared they might attack me if I spoke, I figured it was worth a shot.\n\n"Heyguysdon'tmeantointerruptjustpassingbynotathreattheresabearchasingmejustwantedtoletyouknowincaseitstopsbyyourhouse!" Casual enough. They'd obviously heard me-- my voice echoed through one of their headsets and they went silent.\n\nI heard a door open behind me, and a moment later two loud shots. I feared they'd taken to shooting me, and yelled. "Motherf(steamcensored)s!"\n\n"We got the bear... we weren't shooting at you," this revelation made me facepalm. Of course. I was running in a straight line.. had they wanted me dead they would have done so. And I'd just insulted them after they wasted precious ammo and helped a complete stranger.\n\n"I- oh. I was calling the bear a motherf(steamcensored)r. Thanks guys!" I don't know if we were close enough for my words to reach them.\n\nMultiple shots mere seconds later suggested they hadn't.

It is but its got semi-automatic guns, C-4 and rocket launchers etc.\n\nGame tends to bring out the worst in people and massive QQ from people on chat.\n\nThe thing is Rust is really fun but it does take a decent few hours to build a base not to mention gathering resources for guns and so forth. Because of this when people get raided some tend to have a nervous breakdown on Rust chat.\n\nYou get to log in and mix with some truely socially dysfunctional people whom display some of the worst online in-game bullying actions and behaviour. One has to sit in awe viewing a screen witnessing such online carnage. Marvelous!\n\nThe theme of the fully geared Rust player killing a naked Rust player in KoS (kill on sight) is a political issue online. The nakeds argue its wrong but once a naked is geared most tend to become the KoS`er of nakeds blaming the mental trauma they experienced as a naked in Rust as the reason. Fantastic!\n\nRust dev team are steering the game towards building towns and trade areas between factions/clans. The community is so against it they rage in forums / steam feedback and generally blow the crap out of every base possible, loot everything and leave the owner QQ`ing on chat in CAPS. Ive even seen a naked bashing a wooden foundation with a bow and arrow repeatedly in a desperate attempt to destroy someones hard worked base and loot all it contains. The community are utter savages.\n\nIn Rust its best not to loot random items in certain areas for possible craftable blueprints. If you enter an area like this 99% of the time you will be shot at by fully geared people on safari - shooting nakeds. In fact some tend to build bases in these areas purely for the purpose of pursuing the gentleman sport that is KoS`ing nakeds.\n\nThere is no way you will be able to play this game and create a community for long. The barbarisim of the online community beats zombies any-day. You will NOT survive, you WILL die repeatedly and you WILL get robbed. No one is your friend, everyone wants to exploit you. Rust even has an emerging slave trade. Sometimes someone will have a massive QQ  never to return to the server. We dont know if that person died of a heart attack or went to another server. True dat.\n\nThis is Rust.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","November 8, 2015","true","032.1"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","89","47","53","26","0"

If you’re looking for a game that offers stability and doesn’t require constant tending, pass on this game.\n\nFirst of all the game is still early access and seems to be rather far from being finished. There's weekly updates that require the servers to be wiped clean so even if you don't get robbed blind by other players you will still lose all your progress every week. However, that isn't much of a problem since the main objective of Rust seems to be to break into as many people's bases as possible and hoard as much of their stuff as you can. To top it off when you log out your body lays sleeping unprotected on the ground, so even the things in your pocket aren’t safe. Yes, there are a few honest players that want nothing more than to gather resources the honest way. However these people are few and far between. Even the friendliest public servers are packed with scavengers looking to make a quick score. If you’re just looking for a game to build or a game to gather resources in, stick to another game. (Unless that is, you enjoy the repetition of re-gathering all your resources weekly at best.)\n\nSecond, gameplay is buggy at best. Every update fixes one thing and breaks a dozen more. http://i.imgur.com/HTisMpC.jpg ← Pretty much sums it up. The team seems to be more preoccupied with retouching textures and models each week than they are with fixing known issues. But hey, at least one team is consistent. Kudos, texture artists and modelers of Rust! If updates were put off to perhaps once a month, included larger fixes & were better tested and refined that in itself would make Rust slightly more bearable.\n\nThird, it is WAY too easy to be raided. There is no such thing as a raid-proof house in Rust and the glitches that pop up and the cheats that people come up with only make it easier. I found it tiring to spend hours to gather resource and build a house just to have it broken down, find myself dead and all my supplies missing each time I logged in. This is where the insanity of expecting a different result comes into play.\n\nThe best part of Rust for me is that I get to walk around with my junk hanging out, since I don’t get to do that in RL. Mostly because I don’t have manly-bits in RL. Everyone is a man in Rust and most of those men look exactly the same since even clothing options are limited. It doesn’t bother me and I often joke about it, but it does make it harder to tell one person from another. There’s no form of character customization so telling one person from another at a distance is often limited to asking them to jump twice or flicker their torch.\n\nI do understand this is E.A. and you take that chance when you buy an early access game. I will say though that Rust is the reason I have not bought and will not buy another E.A. game. If repetition and senseless violence and hoarding is your thing, give Rust a try. If not, I hear Minecraft is real nice this time of year.","February 12, 2015","false","140.9"," 151 of 218 people (69%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","69","151","218","32","10"

First, the pros and cons:\n\nPros    Cons            Build your own base\nDestroy other bases!\nLots of exploring, base building and crafting options\nPretty!\nMany server mods\nVery slow development. Updates are regular but tiny, consisting mainly of tweaks\nVery buggy. It's still in Early Access after years of development\nNewbie unfriendly\nMany cheaters\nNo effective anti cheat solutions\nRegular forced wipes of all servers\nGrinding. Lots and lots of grinding\n\nWhen all goes reasonably well, the game is fun. You build a base, try to secure it properly agaist raiders and go raiding yourself. When you get raided, you can see how they got in and work out how to prevent them doing the same next time. Raiding a base is also great fun - find weaknesses in design, carefully step around the sleeping bodies and search for the cupboard and loot room.\n\nThere is, however, a lot of grinding going on. You'll spend most of your time chopping down trees, mining rocks, gathering other resources and playing lottery with blueprints. This is part of the game, but when you spend weeks building a nice base and the developer decides to make a minor update to the map generator algorithm, all servers are forced to wipe their maps, meaning you'll have to start from scratch again for no good reason. Which would be okay if the grinding wasn't such a.. well, grind.\n\nAs a newbie, you would do better to watch "How to play" videos on youtube first. Learning through playing is slow and tedious. You will get killed, a lot. Most people are hostile and will kill you on sight. You'll need blueprints to survive or to make a base that stands a chance of staying in one piece. Just gathering and trying to build a small house from the start will leave you frustrated. It's not until you've gained a lot of blueprints and mastered some of the weapons that you stand a chance of holding your own. Unfortunately, you'll have to redo this on every server you play, and again after every blueprint wipe.\n\nWhen all doesn't go well, there are cheaters. Many, many cheaters. There is no effective server side anti cheat in place, and no data is server side validated. Which means it's incredibly easy to create and use cheats in this game, and that's exactly what happens. Anything from flying and wallhacks to Godmode, aimbotting and item duping. Some cheaters are blatant, but most are more subtle and require online admins to catch them in the act. Which most servers don't have - especially the official servers. One of the most annoying doubts you'll keep facing is: "Did they cheat? Were they really that good or lucky? Can I retaliate or would that be futile?".\n\nI've enjoyed playing this game, but I've reached a point where I feel development gets in the way of the gameplay, and the many bugs, glitches and cheats just leave me more frustrated than satisfied. I'll try again in a year, maybe two.","March 21","false","313.4"," 55 of 67 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","55","67","2","0"

Garry and Facepunch have found an awesome model for revenue stream. Riding on the coattails of Valve, these non-programmers turned game developers have used 20 year old techology and recenly have tried to put "lipstick on the pig," so to speak.\n\nThis group has never heard of things like testing on the development server, process engineering, or menial things such as making milestones to try to achieve goals like getting out of the alpha stage. Their model to stay in alpha leaves them lots of room to make knee-jerk changes with little forethough, documentation, testing, among the few, and say, "it's in alpha..."\n\nSo after 1500 horus I can tell you, it is a non-polished, buggy, broken pvp game, with little or no objectives. The PVE elements are mostly broken.  The tree graphics are laughable. I can go on and on about the short comings of the game.\n\nThe positive is it can be addictive when it comes to building, but honestly the building engine is fair at best and very broken. The terrain can be nice other than the laughable trees which look like 8 bit nintendo all over again from a distance of 150m in game.\n\nThe phsycis engine is horrible, and there has been no mention to change it. However, they do hang their hat on metrics like; stability, etc...\n\nToo simple, it will never be finished,\n\nDon't waste your money/time.","April 18, 2015","false","252.8"," 331 of 506 people (65%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","65","331","506","53","40"

You will get on here because it is the modern tragic play, you feel better about yourself if you destroy something someone else spent weeks on.\n\nRust will show you alot about life, teach you that every movie youve ever seen is a set of circumstances, the hero who pulls through every one unscathed, doesnt exist. maybe one or two close calls, but otherwise they would be dead and forgotten, to put it poetically, you learn that the heroes dont exist, theres just the bad guys in the movies\n\nAnd we are all, the bad guys.","January 12","false","21.5"," 107 of 153 people (70%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","70","107","153","31","3"

If you're into survival, naked people, and being able to build anything from a small shack to a large compound with very little limitation on HOW you build it, then this game might be for you.\n\nThe game throws you into the wilderness with little more than a rock.  Use this rock, to help you gather supplies until eventually you go from that naked guy with a rock, to the dude with a big metal mansion, full armor, and a bunch of guns.\n\nDepending on the server you are in, there might be tons of supplies/materials or very little, and there might be lots of PvP to almost none.  Personally, I enjoy building and hunting so I've found myself a server with lots of materials/supplies and almost no PvP.

It has nice graphics, great gameplay concepts, and an active dev team.\n\nHowever all is not well in the land of Rust even though many will try and convince you that it is.\n\nThe rust general population, not including player owned servers, is insanely toxic, to point of legit psychopaths using this game to grief other people. The game does open up the community to a dog-eat-dog world and honestly I like that it's open to that. I do feel like the developers encourage a toxic atmosphere with the way they interact with the playerbase.\n\nThe developers are incessantly abusive, they go out of their way to play jokes on players and give asinine sarcastic answers whenever they do feel like addressing customers. Facepunch is, by far, the least professional, least respectful, and most vulgar company I've had the displeasure of interacting with. I can only assume they feel justified in the way they treat others because a few of their upper level developers have made a name for themselves among gamers by producing a couple of "first in their genre-niche" games and think that makes them too valuable or too big to fail. You can tell this ruffles my feathers quite a bit.\n\nThe devs are pretty slow on development, new features take months and months to push out and bug fixes take a few weeks to a couple of months. Gameplay quality and player feedback aren't a top priority here. The game's supporters like to hide behind the "Alpha" or "early access" tags as if rust were really treated as such. How many unfinished games do you know of with an item shop?\n\nThe rust's graphics are beautiful, that coupled with fantastic sounds makes it incredibley easy to lose yourself in this game's world. However nothing is immune to the ever present bugs and glitches. Heads warping across the map of dead bodies, glacier shadows stretching over mountains, seeing player shadows through objects, the list goes on but you should get the point.\n\nServers are another issue, with the revenue Rust generates for Facepunch I would expect servers paid for by the developers to be fiscally sounds choices. However more often than not, once a month every single month servers will go down and about 2/3 will take close to 24 hours to come back online or some will never come back. The developers are oddly mute when it comes this. The servers will lag, harshly, and players will rant about how they're being DDOS when it's more likely that Facepunch pays for crap service.\n\nNow don't get me wrong I had fun with Rust. As of writing this I have pretty close to 500 hours. What made it so much fun is what I built and defended with my friends however losing it is harsh, we never reached great heights. We aspired to much and accomplished a fair amount but couldn't compete with those who spend day and night playing in massive groups or against all the hackers who pop up on a regular basis. On top of that there's no end game content theres no goal other than conquer all and kill all. Furthermore, there's no balance as of now this game is a grindfest which only the groups containing the most members can win. You can be the most skilled shot and most cunning ambusher with the base design skills of a god but it means nothing except a handful kills at the end of the day when the clans come and take two days worth of gathering from you. There are bosses in the game which you can build defense items from but again you need a group in order to accomplish that.\n\nI wish this game was better, and it might get there in a few years but i would be remiss if I recommended it to people in it's current state. Save your money and, most of all, save your time. Follow this game and wait for it to mature into something worth investing time into.","May 5","false","547.0"," 142 of 210 people (68%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","68","142","210","8","11"

With that said it is early alpha so a lot of content is missing from whatever product they have envisioned for the full game. That is one of the main reasons why I have to say, don't buy it yet. I was lucky enough to get it for free but overall for the price you are paying there are many completed great games. This game has a great foundation for success, I think it just needs more time to iron out what type of game it wants to be. It seems like it is a poorly mixed group of genres. I put about 35 hours into it and had to stop due to myself feeling as if I hit a plateau in my evolution within the game. Since it is early in its development content isn't the only factor on their minds so it is kind of simplistic as of this moment. Once you are the guy with a decent sized house and a good amount of stockpile there is only so much you can do from that point. The raiding is fun and sense of community is great when you connect with other players from trades and what have you but I felt as if I had "beaten" the game. Meaning ran out of things I wanted to do. Obviously you can have multiple servers with new and creative builds and new communities but as of right now I don't want to do that. So I am going to wait for more content and follow the games progression. Now if you just want to support the developers with your money because you love the idea and want to add in its development with ideas and what not than it is definately not a bad buy, but as I said there are plenty of titles that are finished and will give you more enjoyment most likely.","January 5, 2014","false","38.4"," 74 of 101 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","74","101","0","0"

This game is the biggest time sink I've experienced in a long while.  But let me sum it up for you:\n\n- Work really hard to gather resources and build a base that's heavily protected.\n- Get griefed while offline, all your stuff is gone, all your time invested gone.\n\n- Repeat first point.\n- Server wipe the next day.  All work gone.\n\nUnless you seriously plan to camp out at your base 24/7 (as in, you have no life) - then you're gonna get raided, constantly.\n\nTo the people who might say "That's the point of the game" - great, fine, dandy.  But this is my recommendation, and I simply cannot recommend this game to anybody.  I genuinely regret my time in this garbage.\n\nThe devs are all over the place, constantly adding pointless new content but yet they don't have a long term goal or even a game scope in place.  This game is destined to be in early access forever.  Sadly, people continue to buy it, so it will continue to be super popular.\n\nSkip this title, go for something else.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/252490/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n-Quick Review-\nRust is a survival game developed by Facepunch Studios (Rust has been in Alpha/Early-Access since late 2013). In Rust your greatest enemy is other players. Once you join a game, you gather resources to build shelter, weapons, and armor.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: Your story is completely unique based on who you play against. I have the regular whiny noob story that depicts the wonderful, positive, and cheerful personalities of the player base. (If you don't care to read about Atratzu's first three deaths: Just skip the story section)\n\nFirst Death: Atratzu the first ran into the world starry eyed and ready to explore the brand new world of Rust. Too be Atratzu the first, was killed thirty minutes later by someone with a gun.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=496577579\n\nSecond Death: Atratzu the second, had no intention of repeating his predecessors mistakes. He quickly gathered materials and tried to loot an air drop. A naked man resembling Adam (Bible joke) ran up and asked to team up. Atratzu the second, was no suck-up and ignored the fellow. 5 minutes later Atratzu the second, was interrogated and promptly killed by Adam's friend... whom naturally, ...had a gun.\n\nThird Death: Atratzu the third was by far the most successful, he joined a server that had just reset, so there was no forecast of raining bullets upon his corpse. He settled up in the corner of the world, discovered how to build a house, and was now happily farming the resources close to him.\nOne day later he see's several distant figures running towards him. Atratzu the third has no intention of making enemies, because he fights honorably. But as a show of force, he equips his bow and backs away from them. The threat seems to work as the figures back down.\nAtratzu the third goes back to mining (keeping them in his field of vision) suddenly he hears the whistle of a spear sailing by! Thankfully Atratzu the third had learned how to use the bow and successfully killed one of the attackers. Unfortunately he was overcome by adrenaline and couldn't finish off the other attacker.\nAtratzu the third was murdered but respawned at his base, and heard the “patter patter” of footsteps outside his base. Upon hearing the “CHUNK, CHUNK” noises of a forced assault at his door, he exclaimed “Really? Really impressive, three of you vs one of me?” The attacker had the audacity to say “You shouldn't have attacked us you little {obscenity}, now we're going to take your stuff”.\nThere was no justice, there was no defense, there was no time to craft armor and weapons the thugs beat down Atratzu the thirds door, and killed him in cold blood. No armor, no bow, no defense, there was but one thing he thought when he faded into the dark abyss... “I'm not playing this game by myself anymore”.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=496967985\n\nGameplay: Here's a good tip for anyone planning on getting this game, look up a PvE server first, you'll have much more time to learn the game. Many people will still be insolent, your base will be raided, but at least you won't need to deal with mass noob genocide.\nI recommend reading a guide too, if you want to get into the game faster. I fancy myself a quick learner, but I couldn't figure out how to build anything aside from the default platform with the blueprints.\n(Tip: Remember that with certain items... holding down the right mouse buttons give you more options. So to change what your blue prints do, hold down the right mouse button. Saved you an hour of experimenting.)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497000410\n\nThere is a lot that could be said about how the game works functionally, however the last detail I would like to highlight, is that you can play the “Legacy” version of Rust. (and that's what I'll be playing with my friends who already own the game) The Legacy version doesn't have as many flashy GUI (Graphical User Interface) elements, but functionally and fundamentally seem to be mostly the same to me.\nI'm sure people who avidly play Rust have a stronger opinion on Legacy vs Experimental, but to someone who plays more passively, the difference it mostly aesthetic.\n\nAchievements: There are no steam achievements for Rust, Thankfully. Don't add any, I don't want anything to do with that nonsense.\n\nPrice: Rust is priced at $19.99, if you can get started in the game (cough cough, get a gun, cough cough), you can easily pump hundreds of hours into this game, by defending your base, your items, and your loot.\n\nConclusion: This game is not for me.\nI genuinely have a distrust for strangers, but I don't want to raid other players, I don't take gleeful delight in making someone else miserable.\nI DO delight in defending my base, I DO enjoy challenge, and I DO enjoy playing games with other people. But all in all this game caters more for people who enjoy taking advantage of others. I'm sure I'll play more Rust with friends, but my solo days on Rust are very much over. Everyone I met is too aggressive, too vulgar, and dishonorable.\nI recommend this game to people who enjoy constant struggle and competition with other players, have thick skins, time to burn, enjoy raiding other players, enjoy defending their own bases, or want to experience humanity's worst.","August 25, 2015","true","9.7"," 50 of 63 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","50","63","4","0"

But the reason for a new rust being created is simple: the team cannot code at all. they couldnt progress rust legacy any further because of the web of issues that were created.\nSince they started anew i have gone from having a good opinion about its changes... to a dreadful one.\nThe changes to graphics and "shinies" in the game are vast, lots of new clothing, animals  and graphics are pretty much overhauled.. HOWEVER the optimisation is nothing short of dreadful, it gets WORSE not better with every update made to the game. On the rare occasion an update IS made its to introduce more "shinies" instead of tweak with the crushing perfomance problems. I play this on a computer that NASA would be envious to not own, and i still have terrible framerate and freezing issues. Playing this a month ago it was BAD.... and now its even worse than before, which tells me one thing: very little is being done to improve these issues, they are in fact in my mind stepping BACKWARDS instead of forwards.\n\nI will now state what i think is disgusting of any game company and should not be tolerated whatsoever.\nToday after loading up rust i have noticed on the main menu of the game a list of devblogs, as many people who may have recently logged into rust may have noticed (02.02.2015). Garry or one of his team members has written at the bottom mockingly "tell us how bad we are at our jobs on steam!" followed by a steam review picture with a thumbs down. This is nothing short of childish and shows that either Garry and his team lack the decency to address the feedback of the community and possibly the maturity to even CARE. The people who have invested in this game have every right to review it´s quality, and so far since the RELEASE i have seen nothing but one mess after another. at the start of the game there were zombies, a solid and fun enemy to battle. however after being terrified of being called a DayZ clone they removed them, a foolish decision in my mind but this isnt what i want to talk about. This shows to me that to some extent they DO care about their reputation but possibly have cracked under the stress of the community being angered by their work (or lack thereof) and have simply lost the will to give a flying monkey´s.\n\nIn Summary: DO NOT buy this game if you are expecting to get anything new from the game, its been a slow and utterly dreadful development of the newer rust and i have had nothing but poor experiences. If you want to buy this game to play rust legacy then sure, go nuts. Just dont expect your opinion to be valued for what it´s worth from those in charge.\n","February 2, 2015","false","402.6"," 184 of 285 people (65%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","65","184","285","15","13"

But there is a fundamental flaw with this type of game which is that unless you plan on playing 24 hours per day, everything you do will be for nothing. Your base will be raided when you log off, regardless of whether it takes a few hours, few days, few weeks. There is nothing you can do to stop it. This would be fine if it didn't take so much time and effort to build a base. Also, even if you do make a nearly unraidable base, a hacker will eventually screw you over anyway. All in all, this is basically just a deathmatch FPS with some crafting thrown in.","August 15, 2015","false","257.3"," 97 of 142 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","97","142","7","0"

The more recent race/gender misdirection is not why I recommend against purchasing the game.  If you're looking for a survival game - this game has very little in the way of PVE mechanics.  If you're wanting a PVP game, there are much better - and this one necessitates joining a clan on larger servers.  If you want a sandbox game, Rust is somewhat solid in base building mechanics - but has broken physics and you're going to get tired of the forced monthly wipes.  If you want an honest development team that won't lie to you and say things like, "We're not putting this game on sale until it comes out of Alpha," then consider a different game.\n\nThe game has now gone through three distinct iterations: legacy, early 'experimental', and the current which is distinct in game mechanic, environment, pvp, etc from a year ago.  There is still no direction - the "mind map" is a set of features, but with no point to tie these features together.  The game mechanic most people loved in Legacy has changed   in a way that makes it less unique than others.  Half-thought and half-implemented items, like the guitar, were added because similar games introduced musical instruments.  Raiding continues to be broken, unbalanced.  The game itself is a huge grind, meaning you may spend many hours crafting while you're asleep or AFK.\n\nThe financial success of Garry's mod and Rust make it hard for Facepunch to hear constructive critical feedback from the community, on simple things.  Common excuses the team and current fans use to downplay their lack of technical skill include:  It's alpha, Unity has problems.  Other Alpha games don't have problems with entity count and physics, don't have forced wipes, have great PVP, less hackers, work fine on Windows/Linux/OSX, a smaller team, possibly even less money.\n\nThe bottom line, check out a different game in the same genre, maybe 7 Days to Die, and wait for Facepunch to bring their game out of Alpha.  They've had way more than enough time to respond to customer feedback to develop a product people might want, except that the entire industry already knows that customers want this kind of product.\n\nPros: Lots of great concepts that never get implemented, good art, a previously interesting procedural terrain/world generator that is as of the third iteration, boring.","April 12","false","826.4"," 72 of 101 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","72","101","4","2"

My first experience was terrifying. I woke up naked and alone on a beach only to be chased for five minutes by a naked man with a machete until he cut me down. My next attempt at survival went slightly more smoothly. I sucessfully made a shanty! Ensuring my little hovel was adequately protected, I logged off with a confident mind. I logged in the next day to play and, once again, awoke naked and alone on the beach. My beautiful home had been destroyed, and I had been murdered in my sleep. I began to detest the other players. I lived in fear. Cold and naked. I HATED the "raiders". I didn't understand why they wouldn't let me live my life.\n\nOver the next couple of weeks I struggled to survive, living in the fringe of society. I studied the collapsed ruins of once-great bases and forts. I searched feverishly for blueprints. I stalked other players, learning to sneak around unnoticed. I watched.\n\nThe server performed it's monthly wipe, leaving me with the blueprints to success. Using the knoweldge I gained from exploring raided forts, I was able to build myself a fortress - ensuring that I did not make the same mistakes as the ill-fated survivalists of the past wipe. I farmed for what felt like days. I created weapons. I murderd anyone who DARED to settle within range of my sniper tower. I ruled my kingdom with an iron fist. I have become what I hated.\n\nI love this game.","December 13, 2015","true","180.0"," 41 of 50 people (82%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","82","41","50","29","0"

(sorry for my bad english)\n\nShort Version:\n\nPro:\n+Graphics,Art,Visual.\n+Environment,Atmosphere\n+Interesting game/building mechanics, Fairly complex crafting system\n+Weekly updates less or more.\n\nCons:\n-Time consuming grinding\n-Immature bad community(not just in rust) !!!\n-Exploiting rock base building\n-Bad Anticheat protecion\n-Less cooperative/friendly but more agressive/fighting players.\n-Game in alpha state (less content) but its still OK\n-No offline mode to practice\n\nPros Long:\n\nThe game looks nice with the new version and yes it has requirements but my mid-end PC can run the game well on max settings. It has the atmosphere and I like the game visual style. The game has potential in almost every aspects. I have to say I like this game even it is in unfinished state. You can spend time in game dont worry.\n\nCons Long:\n\nAs I said Rust has potential BUT GUYS we all know that potential is a waste if you don't use its power I don't say Rust is going that way but its on the edge in my opinion. The game has the same hardcore system like DayZ,WarZ if you die you'll loose everything and respawn elsewhere with the rock and torch (Your learned recipies remains right now its very good at least) this mechanic is good if you like this kind of hardcore elements BUT Rust doesnt support any peacefull action, only the outlaws can win and this is frustrating because you'll loose if you dont shoot everything on sight and it force you to don't trust other players. MY main problem is not in the game itself but the bad people and yes the game creates a playground for them and you'll be the toys. I'm not antisoical or emo I'm a normal man but guys there are a lot of mentally damaged gamers with serious problems they are just looking for conflicts and bully. This is just a game but how you act thats a portion of you. I like action and shooting elements but there are just KILLING without reason and no peace or nice communication now it's just a shooter where you loose every stuff. I built a base with almost fully upgraded defense far from everyone and it didn't last 1 night when i went to sleep and I put like 10+ hours to build it. And listen guys it's good that I can loose but they didn't just break in (dunno how easily) and robbed my base which is OK but they searched for my spawnpoints and destroyed it for what reason do they need that for survive or what? Nah this is about just f*ck with each other for no reason to hurt someone. Games are for fun but games can be for adults as well but immature people cannot handle the power when they have a chance to shoot or not shoot a naked guy who means no harm just running around survivng the elements they will shoot you like a dog because it's fun for him for no reason. If you are normal guys with less time you will get bored/mad so lads we are living a modern stone age where you kill just for fun Rust is a nice mirror what reflects the connection between people and very sad that the player base like 80% d*ckheads 10% just running away from you when you are talking to them and the rest 10% is normal who you'll never meet it's pretty bad ratio I'm sad. There are cheaters as well I met with only 1 that's not much but on offical servers it's bad. Also you have to grind and run/look for resources in the game it was obvious.

Not because of the community, not because of the graphics or sound, not because of the features.\n\nThe only reason I don't recommend this game is because the developers took the game from a  community-based survival sandbox  (i.e. Rust Classic) to a  Survival FPS.\n\nI have  a number of interesting stories and enjoyable experiences stemming from Rust Classic. It had a certain magic to it. At the time, no one really understood the game too much and the game wasn't so focused on FPS. With threats ranging from zombies, wildlife, radiation, and hunger, you could work with people and create a group of players all struggling to survive. When I played, I tended to be more diplomatic - and you could do that in Rust Classic. See what each player's about, build "alliances" with certain people, while defending said alliances when necessary. At one point, my house was a meeting spot for a good part of the community I played on. People could go to my place to make trades and meet up, knowing they wouldn't be shot at unless they came across the wrong way. At one point the community we created was so tight, that when a band of raiders started attacking people's homes, a domino effect occurred. An all-out war across the server sprung up. Some people died and lost everything, however the bandits were hit hard and lost their explosives. It easily ranked as one of my tensest and most enjoyable times while playing a video game.\n\nThe gameplay now doesn't seem to get like that anymore. It could just be how I'm playing nowadays, but my experience with the game has become solitary due to the nature of the current state of the game.\n\n\nRust today suffers from a number of things:\nNo sense of direction from the developers.\n\nWhile they keep improving and updating the game, they're all on features that were already there. That isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't focus on the bigger picture. The focus is to survive, but aside from other players, it's pretty easy to survive in Rust. Focusing on what they already have, instead of venturing into new idea territory, consequently made the game more of an FPS.\n\nLack of interactive environment and context.\n\nThey've improved the graphics a lot. It's beautiful. You'd think that they'd make it a harsh environment with aggressive wildlife to complement it, or add features to the world to put everything into context. They could add NPC factions to put the Rust world into perspective. They could add seasons which would alter gameplay depending on the environment. There's towns with radiation, weapons ranging from wooden spears to fully automatic Assault Rifles with attachment slots, random attack choppers hunting people down and an airdrop that comes every so often. All of this with absolutely no explanation. Their goal was to make it a survival sandbox, but since it's more of a Survival FPS now, they should put it all into context if they choose to keep going in that direction.\n\nFocus on guns instead of survival.\n\nOr should I say lack of focus? Because of the earlier point about no sense of direction, they stuck with improving weapons instead of surviving. It's kind of an easy and safe way to create a sense of danger when you're allowing players to get semi-automatic weapons, instead of focusing on survival gameplay mechanics. They could expand the medical area, such as adding various contagious or noncontagious diseases, or a trauma mechanic that makes players fix broken bones from falling, remove bullet slugs, sew up cuts or bandage abrasions.\n\nLong story short: Rust isn't really a bad game, but I can't recommend it. Over three years of the development and it seems to be running in place. They add graphical improvements and update regularly. I've played this game when it first came out and play still today... My experience has largely stayed the same. There's no venturing into new territory for this game. Because they don't want to try something new within Rust and stick with improving features already present, it inadvertently shaped the game from a survival sandbox to a survival FPS.\n\nMy review may have come across a little harsh, especially since it's still in Early Access - don't get me wrong, it's a good game in its own right. My fear is that it's becoming stale over the course of its development, and may end up becoming a game stuck in Early Access because of a lack of direction. I'll make changes to my review later in the future.","March 3","false","218.0"," 125 of 191 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","125","191","5","7"

What they give you is an unfinished game, and then they rake in the cash.  Following the release of the game, two things usually happen:\n\n1.  The game is neglected.  Substantial changes are not made to the game, and the developers refuse to fix things that need to be fixed in the game that would make the game that much more enjoyable (DayZ, for example).\n\n2.  The game is redone over and over again.  New core mechanics are implemented into the game, so that by the time the game is finished or drastically reworked,  It is not even the game that you paid for.\n\nRust is a game that had so much potential.  I had so much fun with the old rust, but randomizing maps makes it so that it is more difficult to find your friends, so the fun is lost.  Gary had a vision for what this game was going to be, and I commend him for making a game that he wants to make, rather than something that the fans want.  You have the freedom to make whatever game you want, but since I invested in a completely different game, can I have my money back?","December 8, 2014","false","114.6"," 78 of 113 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","78","113","0","14"

Heading alongside a Mountain and I look into the Forest and Whats this ?\nA strange army green box was there. It was a Airdrop.\nI looted a Bolt action rifle ( with 2 Bullets) and a SMG ( with 6 Bullets) I thought that these would come in handy.\nI found some big broken Satellites and decided to loot. Found no loot and it was getting dark. I heard a noise and hid in some Small metal room and waited... I ran out and fled for the hills but came back at Dawn. I hit a barrel and ran away, It did not explode so I beat it up and it game me loot ! I went around hitting all the barrels I could find and soon I had: a Crossbow, Salvaged Ice Pick and some blueprint fragmets, Lots of those ! I then thought that I will build a base, I built a 2x2 block wooden base with a wall 1 wall high and I furnished my base with a Forge and set some metal to forge. While the Forge was doing its magic I went around and found more barrels to smash. I went back to base and found that my forge was empty. I went back to busting up barrels but then... I found ... candy bars... on the floor in bags... I took those like a little child, Eating food on the floor ! I then was heading back to base and I stoped to cheak my inventory but was interrupted by a Golden light and a Loud noise. They had come. Bandits. I ran to a Bush while I was being shot and the Shooting stopped... I pulled out my SMG and waited , I man came and looked at me , I knew what Rust players were like and I thought that I would rather Defend my homeland or die trying so I pulled the trigger and let off my 6 bullets like a mad man, all missing his head, I waited for a few secounds and I was on the floor crying for help and I died. I respawned by my sleeping bag that I had hidden in the bush and I saw them, I ran to the base and closed my door... My door would protect me but no... they just opened it like a civilized person would, I screamed into my mic Please don't kill me ! They then said ok Daniel is friendly, game me back my Bolt action rifle and a random Pipe shotgun and left... I went back to my base and logged out.

This game is a blast to play with friends, yet it falls short on the community. You'll spent hours, if not, days, collecting supplies for your base, to be raided by some players who have used an exploit. It's also common for people with weapons to run around killing those who have freshly spawned, and to see people 'act' as frendly fresh spawns, just to pull a gun on you when you act friendly back at them.\n\nFor me, that's where the community falls short. There's no 'honor among thieves', or even just common courtesy. There's a line between killing someone because they have good stuff, and killing someone to just tick them off, and in Rust, there doesn't seem to be that line. A few players find it amusing to place a wooden wall in front of any and all entrances to your base, making it impossible to enter/leave without C4, and that stuff is pretty hard to get hold of until late in the game. It only takes a handful of trolls, griefers and just down right mean people to ruin a server for the rest of the players.\n\nAt the moment, I don't recommend the game as it is in early alpha; yet, if they were to focus more on the actual survival aspect of the game, and not the whole "who has the gun, wins" type of rule, then I would be happy to reccomend the game.\n\nI also hear they will be removing military guns, which I fully endorse, because this game seems to be more of a first person shooter then an actual survival game, because lets face it, surviving in the wild should not involve body armor and assault rifles.","March 25, 2014","false","112.2"," 53 of 72 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","53","72","0","5"

What I can say about it?\n\n-Lag was significantly been improved meaning I don't feel much lag now compared from last month\n\n-Improved AI for animals. Way better than before since now it attacks you continuously but still need more improvement on their movements and how they attack.\n\n-Clothing is still the same it doesn't help you from radiation or probably they will come up with something for that.\n\n-The best part of it is the reworked of buildings. This for me is a very huge update and I can totally say there putting a lot of work on it. The pie selection is great. The demolish building concept is superb and how you upgrade your house has been rebalanced which is really great since you need a lot of resource to upgrade your house and instead of you hammering your house to death just to get it upgraded you only need to hit it a few times and it will automatically upgrade itself on it’s on. Really cool concept if you ask me.\n\n-One major idea that they added is the tool cupboard. This item basically prevents other people to build structure near your house in a certain meter. This for me is one of the best idea that they come up with since it prevents trolls from putting walls in front of your door or building stairs to get up on your house.\n\nIt’s still not recommended for me since bugs are still noticeable but this was a great update and I can see that there’s a huge improvement from before. I’ll wait for more updates and will edit my review base on whatever they came up with. For now, kudos for Garry for this great update.","October 11, 2014","false","150.1"," 84 of 124 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","84","124","0","19"

I find it very surprising that there is that many negative comments about this game. But if you take a second look you will realise that the majority of the comments, are people who is comparing the new rust with the old rust (i played both). And the matter of the fact is that it is two different games. if you would ask me to review the old rust, i would tell you that i personally got fed up spending days, running in and out of rad towns, cause that is all there were to do. The new rust on the otherhand is more about creative thinking. its more about playing it smart. Consider yourself being left behind enemy territory. if you saw a guy in a uniform, could you honestly say that you would run towards him waving your arms, and not expect him to shoot you? Like i said, play it smart, stay in the shadows. When you have set your base up, and you've catched your breath that is when the fun starts. there are endless possibilities when it comes to building a base, just keep in mind, the flashier you make it, the stronger it has to be! if you consider to buy Rust, here is my advice for you.\n1. DONT TRUST ANYONE\n2. convince your friends to join you\n3. stay in the shadows until you are set up.\n4. at the end of the day, if you have more kills than deaths, you are doing alright!\n\nhonestly, the game is alot more fun if you find a couple of people to play it with. i met my crew ingame, so there are nice people around aswel!\n\ni would give this game 10/10  and i would recommend this to everyone aslong as you have just a tiny bit of patience, this isn't counterstrike.","March 14, 2015","true","538.5"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","37","46","3","0"

Read on for more information.\nWhen I first bought rust about a year ago I wasn't surprised by the amount of bugs the game had. It was Alpha and I expected this kind of thing. I was surprised by the fact that even though this game had bugs, (don't forget the hackers as well) this game was quite enjoyable. The main thing of the game is that your stuck on a huge island and you have to build a shelter and defeat other players to survive, along with going to 'rad towns' and getting supplies, (which let me tell you is not always easy when you have a ton of rad bears and wolves coming at you). The game gets pretty addicting and fulfilling especially when you get guns and start raiding other players. There was food and cold but you didn't have to drink water to survive and the game was pretty simple. The other players are the problem, and many of the reviews you read trash this game not because of the reasons I am about to tell you, but because they felt the game was too hard. Most of those reviews are written by players who've played 100 hours or less. Don't read those, they haven't played long enough. The real reason this game is terrible has nothing to do with the way the game is (or was, (read on), the real reason is because of the developers. See this game is probably better than most I have played, until about 6 months ago. See when I first bought the game a year ago this game was not updated until 6 months later, and the developers said that for six months they were developing a newer version, and better version,  and that the old version was now called Legacy. Well for the next six months and up until now that newer version is no newer version at all. Legacy which was the older version that I loved and enjoyed has been torn into a buggy mess that has real updates once a month. Oh yes you will be told they update about once a week, but when you look at what they are updating every week you'll see the crap they are doing. You see all sorts of things like 'lets make this chicken have better textures' or 'look at this new bandage were designing'. Eventually about once a month they'll have an update that will 'fix a whole bunch of bugs and add many new things'. Those updates every month made the game worse, and eventually they started going somewhere when they added all these building updates. You could make all sorts of cool buildings, but then guess what the dev's told us they wanted us to explore and not build, they released a brand new update that limited our building. Then everyone started complaining and they told us 'were hobbyists'. These dev's know nothing of what they are doing, they release patches that ruin the game and they take away things we like to do, like building. Eventually this whole 'new version' which was released 6 months ago in replace of the legacy version was scrapped again! Now they have a Brand new version which was just released in January. The updates they are releasing seem way more promising than they did before, but seriously this game has been out for a year. A whole year it took to get a better version! Take a game like H1Z1, which was also just released in January. The game which is in Alpha right now when released had an enormous amount of bugs. The amount of bugs have now been reduced so much within a month that the game is very much playable and provides us with more 'items' in the game within a month than rust has added within a year. In fact Rust has not added really any 'new' items to the game at all. This new version is still being built up to the amount of the Legacy version. Either way Rust has been rebooted several times now and if I were them I would just scrap the whole thing and go back to the Legacy version and start updating that version again. This game used to be a hell of a game, and now all we have to look forward too is another version of 'chicken textures updates'. H1Z1 looks like a much more promising game as the devs are responding to us much faster than the devs of Rust. If I were you i'd save your money on Rust but dont forget about Rust. This game is still in Alpha and if the devs can manage it maybe we can look forward to a Beta with more features and less bugs.

This game is truly my favorite game on the Steam market. Rust is not for ragequitters or sensitive types. You will die by cold, hunger, thirst, drowning, fall damage, animals, and most of all, other players. You will lose everything you spent hours, maybe even days, to acquire. You may even get harassed by other players. Nearly everyone has these experiences at some point in Rust. As a primarily solo player, I absolutely love the thrill and challenge of surviving in Rust. I'm pretty terrible at PVP, but Rust notably has some of the best PVP. Building in Rust is unmatched by other early access games (including H1Z1 and ARK). Building in Rust has to be strategic if you want to survive the night. Not to mention, it is extremely time consuming (and sometimes difficult, depending on the population size of your chosen server), to gather enough resources to build and fortify your base. Rust is hostile, vulgar, and full of trolls, but it is also challenging and beautiful. It's that one game I will always recommend to my friends. It's not an easy game to play solo, especially if you're on a high pop server where there are likely multiple clans or groups that PVP and raid. My only word of advice for anyone who is new to Rust is don't give up. You're going to rage in this game sometimes, but don't quit. Survival was never meant to be easy.","December 5, 2015","true","183.1"," 57 of 80 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","57","80","7","0"

Joined a server.. got shot.  Talked in chat, was told to F off.  Then chat was spamed for ten minutes. Tried respawning with my rock and was shot on site.  Joined another less populated server (<20 people) and built a shack, but realized there was no player interaction at all, so why play just to do nothing with literally no PVE interaction or interesting crafting.  Joined a mid sized server, was shot on site.  I asked why shot a naked guy with a rock, they told me to get more skill.  Thanks!  i just bought the game, and spent about ten-twenty minutes on Wiki just to learn what the heck to do b/c players are extremely toxic if you dont join a group before playing.  So, I respawned and was looting a rock, then got shot.  Respawned again.. get the story?\n\nWhere is the player interaction?? Is it just griefing brand new players and KOS.  Is the goal of this game just to be lucky enough or have a big enough group to get geared just to grief naked players and KOS... I have no ability to plan a route or avoid players because I have no idea where I am, and cannot even see the players shooting me with guns I will never be able to get.   If you are looking for cheap thrills and no skill kills.. this is your game.  I am giving this a temporary not recommended.

I've tried DayZ and realized that game is going nowhere (let's hope it will start to move on toward something good). So 've jumped right in Rust, and boy, did I fall in love! We had a beautiful server (Rust Survivor), a great community and it was all about having fun. There were bandits, workers, builders, server police, airdrops, even one admin was a living jukebox that used to visit during night to ease the tension. I've played almost thirty happy hours of Rust version that's called 'legacy version' right now. Thirty hours may appear like nothing to you, but in my life - thirty hours is a whole lot of dedication, believe me.\n\nAnyway... I've faded away because of my obligations and when I've decided to reinstall it, I've figured out my beloved server and people are all gone, legacy version is hacker and cheaters infested heaven turned hell and Rust's experimental version became officially the new and 'stable' one. OK, I said to myself, time to move on.\n\nYou may call me an 'old fart', but after playing one hour of new stable (formerly known as experimental) version of Rust, all I can say is... WTF?\n\nGame is over the top buggy, clunky and badly compiled, failing where previous version succedeed. There's no more atmosphere, no more fun and certainly no more addictiveness that was the thing why I've loved Rust in the first place.  Certainly, they've added a lot of new things since legacy, but the general impression is they've manage to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game in so many possible and impossible ways.\n\nWhy they didn't keep legacy up and running with good antihack protection, I will never understand, but Rust at this particular moment is a good game gone bad with an experimental stable version that's way too experimental for me to have fun. I'm not in the mood to spend my precious gaming hours figuring out how to get ride of thousand and one bug that I occur and I will not tolerate it because I've seen Rust in a better shape.\n\nSo, as of now, as a Rust fan - I don't recommend you to buy this game.","December 2, 2014","false","31.7"," 48 of 65 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","48","65","0","0"

The talented team, with king Garry from Garry's Mod in the front are constantly delivering plenty of updates right now that you can watch in the blog where they report everything.[playrust.com]\n\nThe old engine (legacy) is what is being showcased in the videos/screenshots on the steam page right now, and it's probably the version many people played when they first bought the game. Now it's way, way different and better and it's getting more work done.\n\nNot to mention, the graphic and random terrain generation overhauls are superb.\n\n\nThe gameplay:\nIn rust, the focus is on three things:\n- base building\n- resource gathering and hoarding\n- base raiding\n\nIf any one of those is something you are interested, you'll have a blast.\n\nWhat you want to have to get the best out of the game:\n- friends\n- time around the clock\n\nThe experience is hardcore, and basically requires you to play it regularly to keep what you build.\n\n\nBasics of the game:\nThe map is either custom made or randomly generated, and really varied.\n\nThere are other players on the server, and when you log out your character sleeps where he is and can be killed/looted.\n\nYou have needs like hunger, thirs, cold, wetness, comfort and more to be added.\n\nYou gather resources by utilising tools on the resources in the map (tress, rocks) and hunting animals.\n\nYou build bases in a modular fashion, where you place foundations, then pillars, then walls, then doorways, then doors, then locks on those doors. Bases modules can be square or triangular. Door locks can be key based (where you craft the key to the door) or pin code based.\n\nYou can destroy buildings by hitting them with axes/pickaxes (it takes maybe an hour to do so on high upgrades) or use explosives like C4 detonation or rocket launchers (that are hard to craft or find).\n\nBases modules can be upgraded by hitting them with tools and using up resources in your inventory. I think the stages at the moment are: twigs, woods, stone, iron, reinforced. Each of them can withstand more punishment before going down.\n\nThere are some objects called cupboards that authorize building in an area around them. Meaning if you click on them, only if you're authorized you can build around it (to prevent grief building around a base you own).\n\nThere are plenty of weapons and gunplay is fairly hardcore. Need to aim down sights. Shotguns, tommyguns, pistols, AKs, bolt actions, all of them really artisanal and rusty looking.\n\nMost items have durability and degrades / can be repaired.\n\nThere are random air drop events around the map where a rare package gets dropeed with supplies and weapons. Encourages PvP.\n\nFriendly fire is of course enabled.\n\nWhen you die, you spawn to a bed you own (there is a 200+ second cooldown on respawn on bed atm) or you can just spawn randomly along a coast.\n\nYou can request a friends bed so that you can spawn on it through a command. (so you can meet up with friends if you just joined on a server).\n\nThere are radiation zones, with buildings that spawn loot barrels, but you receive damage over time if you are not protected in those areas.\n\nYou have to research items if you want to KNOW how to craft them. Either find the blueprint as a drop, or research at a research bench for a chance to gain the items knowledge, and destroy it in the process.\n\nThere are plenty of flavourful items in the game right now, like paintings, guitars, signs, campfires, roofs.\n\nRoleplay as much as you want, since people are generally really fun to play with. Set up a shop, be a militant general, be a hunter, be a city manager, be a lone wolf, be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Whatever you want, you can play however you want.\n\nPeople start naked, and if you deactivated censoring you can see pinis in front of your eyes while you're hurled up in your base.\n\nAll characters are male now, for good reason. You have a random race and skin color when you sign in that's tied to your steam profile and cannot be changed.\n\n\n\nSo much ♥♥♥♥ to do, so much fun to have.\nA great time sink for the hardcore survival lovers.\nDo whatever it taeks to survive.\nGather some friends and play the night away.\n\n9/10","June 2, 2015","true","324.9"," 44 of 59 people (75%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","75","44","59","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamonyx/recommended/252490/","iamonyx","onyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamonyx/","244 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDisclaimer: I have had RUST before it came out on steam more than two years ago in Closed Alpha. I was heavily into base raiding and PVP. If you plan on playing in carebear PVE servers, skip this review. But here are my two cents about its current status otherwise. Take it with a grain of salt if you will...\n\n----------------------------------\n\nYes: The developers are more active now than ever.\nYes: It gets frequent content updates.\nYes: Game's a blast when playing with a group.\nYes: Graphics are looking more spectacular now than ever.\nNo: Glitching/hacking still exists. (It's just the nature of this type of game, more on that later)\nNo: Game feels like a clunky mess after being rebuilt numerous times. (It was very responsive originally.)\nNo: Janky new mechanics are a hindrance in a situation where you need to be responsive against other players.\nNo: The game is STILL in Alpha Early access after two years. (Not unusual if you look at DayZ, but still.)\nNo: Updates are slowly transitioning towards content only updates, with less and less technical updates from Garry. (Which is what this game needs in my opinion; more on that below.)\n\n----------------------------------\n\nWith that being said, the two biggest issues is that the game has been rebuilt from the ground up constantly, and the hacking/glitching issues.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n1. The game used to be responsive, though with the introduction of each rebuild it turned into a more and more unresponsive mess. Movement and responsiveness are huge factors in a game where aiming and positioning are the two most important things when PVP comes into play. This leads to unsatisfying deaths feeling like your character should be moving one way but turned out to be kind of glued into a certain spot. More often than not the game looks like a testing ground for Garry to practice his coding, the game worked as is initially, and now too much time was spent redoing the entire thing just for it to look nicer and feel smoother.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n2. With hacking and glitching overall: It's hard to blame Facepunch Studios on this one, as they have taken a lot of measures to prevent hacking and glitching, but it's such a huge issue in these types of games. You can't stop someone who constantly works against you in coming out with paid/private hacks when they have a price incentive for customers who are willing to skip the games week grind if it means killing a top tier base and being at the 'end game' instantly, along with having the edge and never dying. Dying and losing your stuff is a huge net loss, both morally and game wise.\n\nFind a hacker in CS:GO? Report him and move on, you only wasted 30 minutes of your time, and you most likely never see him again. Hackers in DayZ/RUST? Your entire weeks worth of work is down the drain. With all the anti cheat improvements, RUST is the type of game where even one hacker/glitcher getting through can ruin the game for an entire server. Though with the type of game its hard to even identify one, granted if you're offline and your stuff is just gone with the doors/walls still up, you'll have no person to point at. Even with wallers/aimbotters, it's hard to tell with no spectate option, unless you get shot in the head 5 times instantly. But a game such as this can't be expected to have a spectate option. Like I said its just the nature of this type of game.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nI expect this to be in Alpha for another year honestly, if it ever leaves Early Access is another question entirely. I honestly can't recommend a purchase at this point knowing that the formula is said and done, and if you're looking for a game like RUST, then there are others way ahead of the curve. I feel like a games experience shouldn't come down to an admin trying to police a server, which is what happens here. The game itself should be designed with preventative features like that in mind. Games like these apply a human band-aid in the form of admins, who can be more often than not, biased, and given/give special treatment, though its hard to argue when you own the server. Still the thought of an in-game admin is archaic and should be left in the past along with the games that lacked proper mechanics that required a person to log in and manage a game.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nAll in all, I feel like the game just isn't worth it. The current direction its headed reminds me of ARK:SE, which isn't a bad thing, but ARK:SE already got there first. Even worse is that Facepunch Studios is working on the next Garry's Mod, which means Garry will focus his time on the next project and leave this one up to his community managers and content staff to finish up the main bits, while he adds a shiny new effect here and there.\n\n----------------------------------\n----------------------------------\n----------------------------------\n\nFor all old rust players out there reading, the game was a definite blast when it first came out. Now it's just a complete mess of a project trying to play catch up after struggling to redefine the game so many times. For new rust players, skip this one and go for another game in the genre.","September 11, 2015","false","115.0"," 121 of 191 people (63%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","63","121","191","16","4"

Except for the fact that one of the admins of Facepunch Singapore 2 official server is very biased. Admin Holmzy you know what i'm talking about ;)  The said admin, Holmzy, decided he should side with some of his in game friends at the said server that i have always played at. What happened was simple.. My clan raided another big clan on this server.. We wrecked their bases pretty hard and blocked off all entrances and exits so that they wont be able to use the base again after we raided them. The clan who got wrecked then decided to be some sore ♥♥♥ losers and called on their friendly neighborhood admin Holmzy to help them. Holmzy then proceeded to remove all the blocks and walls that my clan had placed in their bases so that they can re-use their beautifully wrecked base again and not have to start afresh building another base.. I think we can all say that that was a perfect example of Admin Abuse.. And to think that it all happened in the official facepunch server, by an official admin... Unbelievable. I wont be surprised if i see my comment deleted by Garry :) I'm not trying to say that i wont be playing this game anymore.. This game is amazingly fun. But if admin Holmzy continues to be bias and just spoils all the fun, then i would like to have my money back. After playing this game for over 500 hours, i have never experienced this type of Admin Abuse until just recently (Yesterday)..\n\nIf you are planning to buy this game, by all means do it if you want to. I'm not saying its a bad game. Its just that Admin Holmzy loves it when someone ♥♥♥-licks him. So if you're not into ♥♥♥-licking, then i suggest playing in a modded server would be better. Its alot more fun there but admin abuse is also unavoidable there. Have fun everyone.

Let me be a serious voice in the crowd.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW. THIS GAME IS THE VERY EXAMPLE OF WHY EARLY ACCESS GAMES ARE A BAD PURCHASE.\n\n**EDIT 7/17/2014**\nI came back to this game after months of inactivity, to see if it has changed enough for me to want to play it. It has not. This game is every bit as bad as it was to begin with. This time around, I chose a server with 0 population and played for 5 hours in blissful peace. No one to bother me, only survival. I amassed quite a wealth of items and gear and was just starting to get to the point where I could decently explore my surroundings without dying. I logged off inside of my home, determined to come back later.\n\n24 hours later, I logged on to find myself stranded in the middle of nowhere, with nothing on my person. I tracked down my 2-level house, nestled in the mountains near the coast, and found it utterly destroyed and my defenses wrecked. Someone had found my home while I was logged off, destroyed everything I had spent my time building and collecting, killed my unconscious avatar, and stolen every single thing inside my home that was not nailed down. I feel cheated and frustrated. There is no point to this game, it seems to be lacking development for being early access, the community is still awful, and it will only punish you for purchasing it. Please do not buy this game and do not support it's development.\n\n**************************\nCurrently Rust is in a VERY early alpha. The game is currently broken, in a number of different ways, and many people are having issues even looking for a server without crashing. From the standpoint of PvE, the game is entirely easy and it takes very minimal effort to stay alive past the first few days. Enemies and hazards are few and far between, and so laughably avoidable or killed that you genuinely don't have to worry, so long as you've had the foresight to build a hatchet or bow. Servers reset frequently with even small updates, though, so you will lose everything you've spent time building/collecting and it feels like pulling teeth. The game is also very rough and explains nothing, so your first few hours will be frustrating and hard without a companion who knows what they're doing, and that's IF you find a community server that doesn't have terrible latency or weird settings.\n\nNow for the meat of this review: The community SUCKS. I'm not talking "Oh, they have poor attitudes" sucks. I'm talking a HUGE percentage of hackers, modded servers that are intended to troll by making it impossible to get certain items, and outright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gery on a level you have never seen. People always shoot you in the face first, no questions asked, without any regard for your progress. Hackers regularly (I'm talking 60% of the time) enter servers and spend their time destroying every house they come across, just for lulz. Often, when someone raids you, they will destroy your sleeping bag, so you can't even find your house again after they kill you for the 15 or 16th time, just to hear you get angry. Every house I have ever built has met the business end of a block of C4 within two days of creation, regardless of how remote the location I have placed it in, and that's only if I didn't get shot in the face while I was building it. And trying to communicate with this pack of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is like trying to rip my fingernails off through my colon.\n\nThere is currently no incentive to play this game, past the first two or three hours of nail-biting exploration and the one or two decent people you meet. It is NOT worth the $20 price tag at present and will likely frustrate the hell out of you unless you are fortunate enough to run your own server. Wait until it either hits late beta or goes gold, then re-assess whether or not it's worth the purchase at that time.","January 6, 2014","false","9.0"," 45 of 62 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","45","62","0","4"

I found a server with a low population and it was fun for a few days , but you have to spend hours at a game like this. So if you are a  casual player make sure you have friends who also play or you wont get anywhere in this game. If youve played  War Z ( now infestation) or Dayz or any of those types of games youll have an idea of the community in this game . some mean well but most just want to kill you for fun , or your loot. Thing is in this game you are never truly safe . Youll get raided non stop . to give an example 5 minutes prior to writing this review i relogged into rust only to find my base being held under seige by a group of players in kevlar. Even if you have a base players can put up ramps to get in or even break/blown down walls and doors Which i really dont find fun if you have spent so much time in the game , but hey it happens. Oh also i forgot to mention since the game is still farely new it patches quite frequently so servers will usually get wiped , so all your goods stored away and your bases will go poof and sometimes so will your crafting recipies. I also wouldnt recommend joining full servers because ppl will just run around as nomadic nudists killing you >_< and yes that had happened to me the first time i ever played this game. If youve got the time , dedication, and friends then be my guest and drop $20 on this . if you dont .... well i'd figure surviving out in the wilderness irl will be more fullfilling\n\n**Update** so as of recently like last weekend , early April i decided hell ill play rust again . within a few minutes i ran into a player luckily i had a revolver but all in all he was friendly , we teamed up / talked over skype and eventually ended up with a 3 man team ! , however we switched servers the next day and started from scratch it wasnt so bad i suppose xD ,  we were playing on a no repair and instant craft server which will save u some time but wont save you enough , as i mentioned in my previous review this game takes alot of time to play ... i mean alot , youll find yourself getting sucked in with a mental to do list of crafting and there goes 1... 2... 3 hours . also you should understand in this game its raid and be raided blue prints are your friends , sleepers can be your downfall ,and c4 left in your base will be used against you , whoops let me get back on track. oh yes so time wise youll end up trading away a good weekend or your soul into this game to realize that you got raided , so what it happens its a part of the game but it truley does strike at your morale and begins to get really repetitive after awhile , i havent tried but id assume the only way to get anywhere in this game woudl be to join a clan and build a base with 4+ ppl , but 2 c4 can wreck your perfect base , my 3 man team ended up taking out a base with 4 sleepers and god knows how many sleeping bags but on our way back we were gunned down by 2 players , sad but true , Rust is very unforgivening so you have to be unforgiving back . also from what ive heard there are alot of hackers , is this statement legit ? hell idk my accuracy with guns in this game isnt top notch so id be a fool to accuse but be on your guard , good luck out there , and oh ... you might want to fork up that air drop signal b4 my buddies and i take it with force :) enjoy !","December 31, 2013","false","47.7"," 45 of 62 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","45","62","0","0"

My friend asked me if I had heard of Rust, the new survival game that was coming out. A week later, I was equipped with a rock and a torch on a dangerous server with 75 other naked men. I spent the next two weeks running around, killing zombies with an iron fist and my rock. But as I was killing the last zombie in Rad Town, a stranger wearing all black came up to me. He yelled over the sketchy Voice chat"Come." He showed me his castle, a giant metal structure rising hundreds of feet into the air. He ushered me inside and equipped me with a mediocre pistol, and some pants. As I left the building, he asked me what my name was. I responded, "Shrek". From then on I was known as shrek the zombie slayer. I would roam around the colerful land of rust killing zombies mercilessly with my handgun. Then the Clan came. They took my wife, my kids, my house. And I was lost. Then the man with the metal house found me, and gave me an m4 with a lazer sight. He told me tonight, we take over the  clans base. I was afraid, they had my wife and my kids. They even took my furnace! There were 7 of them and two of us! But we went under the cover of night, with our rifles, and snuck through their open door. We found them in the corner, passing chicken meat and kevlar armor around. As they were distracted, we unloaded our rifles on the clan. They fell one after another, not reacting to our shots. The man of the metal house said follow me! He led me to their sleeping bags, which we promptly destroyed with our rocks. The man of the metal house then looked at me and shot me in the face. I never saw him again.\n\nThis was probably the most fun I have ever had in a multiplayer survival game. Broken, buggy as hell, but still the best multiplayer sandbox experience you will ever have.","December 14, 2014","true","71.6"," 117 of 185 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","117","185","3","6"

No Zombie, no Monster needed. People in game is bad enough which is amazing game system.\n\nThe more you play the more you get to it. It's best game addiction ever. Well.. Before we go deeper I think it's important to understand why are you playing game. I have my job and responsibility over family therefore game is something for relaxation not a second job!\n\nRust, game play is amazing, The game engine is not bad at all. Good game idea and system. Graphic is improving every update.\n\nThe more I play the more I found there is no balance in the game and it's purpose less.\n\ngood shooting and intelligent skill are not enough in Rust. It requires all your time and energy to become best in game or in order to survive. I play both Solo and Clients.\n\nWe manage to become best clients of snow region. We have over 30 people. Massive base and really well organize. At first it was fun cause you have friends and enjoy it but later on. It really became a second job. You need to maintain  the base and ♥♥♥♥. Many more problems comes like friends are not on-line together. You get kill  and robed by playing solo. Stuff got stolen in base. C4s has been use by no one know who used it. Doubt on each other. Blaming others cause not everyone work hard as others.\n\nAfter hours of playing you soon will realized time is wasted for nothing. Server wipe every freaking month or at least two months. Depends on the update.\n\nThe point of the game is simply how to be a big mafia in Server cause you have all guns and C4s. Then raid others cause they mess with you then you get revenge by other cause you raid them. All your hours and hours of building base are now destroyed for nothing.\n\nThat is pretty much how Rust is.\n\nThe conclusion is if you have enough time to keep up with the game. This is totally perfect otherwise this is not what you are looking for :)","May 15","false","710.2"," 49 of 69 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","49","69","2","8"

Soon I noticed a totally decked out guy and his naked friend walking along with assault rifles. So I jokingly ask the guy on the mic if I can have some stuff. Expecting to be shot, I was surprised when he dropped his clothes, assault rifle, and ammo for me. I suspiciously took it and then tagged along with the guy for a while. All the while I've been seeing chat messages of people saying they've "been frisked for their rock" or "were held at gunpoint for their rock". Next thing I know, the guy who gave me the equipment (named Secret Service) is frantically explaining into the mic to a panting guy holding us up with a pistol that his rocks were all in the bag on the ground. The guy holding us up is named Aquaman. He starts hissing into the mic "WHERE'S MY ROCK?????!!!?". While this holdup was going down I sneaked off and looted a couple bags, picking up a shotgun and 8 shells in the process. So I walk back over and, entertained by this guy and his novelty rock collection, willingly throw down my rock to expand his collection. All of the sudden I see the laser from his pistol sweep in my direction as he angrily screams into the mic "GIVE ME YOUR SHOES THIS IS PRISON THAT'S HOW IT WORKS!" he continued to ramble and in my panic I sunk a shotgun shell in his stomach before he could finish his next sentence, while my two new "friends" Secret Service and Misguided seem to be horrified. They're frantically explaining into the mic how I'm going to regret this, and I start running because surely this guy will respawn near his stash of weapons and whatnot, and he seemed like a psychopath. This kid can't even be 14. So as I'm running I fall off a cliff and break my legs, so I slowly am escorted to Secret Service's home where he gives me some medical attention and begins building me some supplies and a sleeping bag. I asked in the mic how Service knew about this kid Aquaman and asked if he was insane and next thing I know I hear the kid say "Yes I am *cackling*" as he drops through the roof and shoots me in the head. I never found that bunch again.\n\n10/10.","July 14, 2014","true","53.5"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","32","40","2","12"

What an amazing accomplishment for Facepunch! The game has every element of a blockbuster survival game, and if I may say so, really showed DayZ how it's done. Even in alpha, I can already tell that this game is going to be the dominant survival game as the maps get bigger and respectively as Facepunch gets bigger and more innovative features are added. This project will definitely be their main focus and with such positive responses from the majority of players, how could it not be?\n\nThe game went right by taking what a survival game needs, challenges and obviously survival, and then brought it to the next level by allowing players to create their own bases / spaces and topped it off by requiring players to get resources to make those bases, which created a unique work and reward system. The game is designed with a narrow enough objective scheme (survival) to keep players on track while allowing them the room to make moral and creative choices. For example, you could help a new spawn or kill him and take his rock, LOL, or build a house here or maybe over there ;). Each blueprint, each won firefight, and each new floor to your house gives you that sense of adrenaline and accomplishment.\n\nFor me to have seen Facepunch grow as a company in the half decade I've been around here, as Garry's Mod was my first game on Steam and the game that made me decide I wanted to make games for a living, it's an incredibly inspirational and happy moment to see FP hit this one out of the park.\n\nAddicting and perfectly designed - 10/10.\n\nGo Garry, go! :)","February 1, 2014","true","193.7"," 81 of 124 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","81","124","0","19"

Remember, it is an early access alpha, and it is about to change as I will change this article as well accordingly.\nThe game is fun and has HUGE potentials. You can get lost doing the basic stuffs like gathering resources, building, exploring or doing PVP. The real fun comes from the interaction with other players, who can be friendly, natural or hostile and you never know what they will do when you meet them first. You should always care for what you build or what you have and this puts a constant intense experience in the game.\nHowever the cheaters make life hard at the current state, and there are some bugs or server problems (lags) which may also reduce the fun a bit, but the main problem is cheat. It can be really hard as a new player to get along, but once you learned what to do and what to avoid, it will be much better.  You should be ready to start over your character due to cheaters or resets because of the development. If you can't handle it, I would recommend to get rust later, but if you can cope with this, I heavily recommend to start playing because it has tons of fun for a fairly cheap price :)","February 3, 2014","true","445.6"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","30","37","0","1"

You might notice I got 900 hours of rust. I know this game since legacy, back when there were still zombies, so I've seen the developement of both the games and Facepunch. 3rd speaking of dev. I'm not gonna compare Legacy with the new Rust, since like people said before, they are kinda 2 different games (altough they are implementing always more stuff from legacy to Rust), so I will speak a bit of both.\n\nAlso let me say that I got this game recomended by a RL friend, who said there's a hype about this totally new and innovative game where you have to to survive in a world, eat, craft, hunt and build a house, where there's open PvP, made by a indie company, only catch, its an early access game. I thought I would still give it a try, have fun with my friend and help this company make their goal true, like crowd funding (which I kinda got to regret later). He stopped playing after a couple days.\n\nGame developement itself:\nWhy is there even 2 versions of Rust? Because the original Rust (Legacy, new rust is just Rust) is a mess, engine and performance-wise. When Facepunch realized that the very foundations were crap, the best solution was to restart and do it right from the beginning instead of reprogramm everything. Rust has and always had troubles with bugs and performance, while graphically not being that impressive, specially in legacy. While the new rust definetively looks much better and can look great in full graphics, dont let the screenshots fool you, its still no skyrim like many ppl like to say, and noone plays like that as the fps drops to an unplayable state. I still always read from people with supercomps that get low fps and lags. Cheaters is another common problem specially in legacy. While they tried to fix that in Rust with EAC (EasyAntiCheat) which indeed did help at first (always more hackers find their way in), it also added half-dozen problems like EAC: DIsconnect, which added to the other half dozen problems of the game itself like some people getting black screen or others not finding server list, made alot of people not be able to play new Rust (me included) till recently and some still not to this day.It is really only recently that the game has become somewhat stable and playable, altough performance still lets wishes open, and usually for every change or fix, there come 3 new bugs which sometimes are released from dev test server even when obviously bugged. And they have changed the whole system so many times one would think they dont even know what they want, which direction they are heading, but it only keeps changing, not evolving (much atleast).Now I perfectly know this is still an EA game and in alpha, far from finished, but alot of people put alot of money in this game, and consindering how they handle developement, their attitude, and after all this time, one cant help but be disappointed in this game and company that call themself hobbysts while having made millions of an alpha game, often not listening to the suggestions of the people but implementing unnecessary stuff noone asked for.\n\nGame itself:\nRust used to be something kinda new (only to be compared with DayZ that time I think) that, altough it originally had zombies (which got replaced later by red animals), is mainly caveman themed, with the radiated towns the only hint of some lost modern society, where your goal is to survive. But while one thinks this is kinda a fallout online, its just mainly a PvP game where you walk alot, because there's not much else to do after having built your fortress and having gotten all weapon and C4. Now while I had my share portion of fun in this game by creeping people in their houses at night with predator sounds (this game LIVES from voice chat and would be dullier than usual without) and laser sight, playing both alone and in groups, playing both pacifically and as raiding bandit, after building a base, getting raided, rebuilding, raiding, server wiped, building, raiding etc and repeating this process a hundred times (if you can't handle people bullying you and robbing/wasting your resources and time, dont play this, many people will backstab you), you can't help but feel this game needs much more to keep it interesting. While the thrill of the hunt (or being hunted while full of loot) can be exciting and make your heart race, there are so many other promising survival games that look better, are more interesting or devs work faster ( zombie survivals, dino surivals, mutant survival. I specially am interested in the co-op PvE of The Forest other EA games coming out, PvE in Rust is just kindergarten). So unless you like being a bandit, murdering and robbing other players, destroying their house and progress, eat their corpse and are ok with people doing the same to you, then I don't recommend paying for this game.\n\nNow with all this said, since I cant sell or trade the game, I'll keep playing it from time to time, hoping that maybe in late future the game will finally be completed. Or until I completely loose hope and C4 it.\n\nUpdate1: They added now Rocket Launcher. A fun addition, but that means the game becomes even more PvP and less survival. Now newbies and casual games will only "survive"  12 hours instead of 24 hours. Alot of other people complaining about this too saying it becomes Battlefield/CoD.\nIf you're looking for PvP, play CoD. If you're looking to build, play minecraft. Survive? The Forest.\nLooking to troll? Buy Rust.\n-Did a little research, just found out the probable cause of all the signs disappearing. It seems like Rust saves every sign, at every stage of the painting, on everyone's local computer folder, resulting in everyone on the server having several versions of everyone's signs.\n\nUpdate2: Ok I'd like to start with some people blaming me for A) giving an EA game a bad review and B) giving bad review after 1000 hours. A) Yeah its EA. Its been for 2 years. I think that gives me the right to criticize it honestly and fairly. B) yeah it took me 1000 hours and 2 years to come to this conclusion and be able to give a fair review about its developement and features. Oh and btw, how do YOU know if I had fun in all those 1000 hours? Do you realize half of that is AFK crafting and much boring farming???\nNow to the updates: the last 10 updates were mainly more PvP and gunz and ammo updates. Only 2 real good things were implemented: Farming crops and female characters (atm only for admins). Oh and some PvE server command that I dont know what good it does. Aside from these 2-3 changes, the rest has been PvP changes. Sure, I guess its nice to have incendiary ammo, but WHERE is the SURVIVAL in that? The survival aspect in this game is the PvP. PvE is still a piece of cake. And unless you got a big active international clan going, you will most probably get raided. Now if Rust intends to be a Troll vs Troll game, thats fine with me, after all they did warn us that game content could change anytime. But please, don't sell it as a "survival" game then if its just a big-map-running PvP game, because that's what the (OLD) trailer is basically telling us what Rust is. I thought I was buying sometihng in the lines of "The Forest" or "Savage Lands" but they removed Zombies and Mutants and you only got players to fight now cause else you bore very quick. I will admit thought, the game's got slightly better in those years since its first steam release.\nThat is my veridict. If you're a sadomaso and into trolling people and getting revenge this might be your game, else, stay far away from it. This is probably also my last update.\n\nOh btw, maybe you find this more helpful: Got raided, got mad, went bazinga and got revenge by making whole servers go rage-quit. 3/10 wouldn't do again.

Kill or Be Killed! Any cliche saying you can think of in regards to survival apply here. Is it the most realistic survival game out there? Probably not. But imagine this:\n\nYou've just spent countless hours harvesting materials and avoiding dangerous cliffs, wolves, bears and even radiation. You finally find your way back home after being lost in the dark for the last 20 minutes. By your sleeping bag you place your large wooden storage crate which holds everything you have to your name... then you hear it. The feint footsteps grow louder. At this point, the adrenaline within you takes over.  Even the slightest sound begins to make you breathe heavy.  "What was that clicking noise?" you ask yourself. The light from a flashlight mounted upon a gun stares directly into your eyes and into your very soul.  In almost an instant you find yourself not within a finely crafted base, but within a tomb you have worked so hard to seal yourself within. You have a bow, a few arrows, some raw chicken, and a few wood planks.  "What could they possibly want?" you think to yourself, "The items I have with me can't possibly be worth much! Perhaps they want what little metal I have stored in my chest!". "FRIENDLY!" you call out in desparation, "Friendly! I just bought this game like a week ago!". Silence follows; however, this silence is maddening. "Hello?!" you cry out. "Is someone out there?". Just as you are at the intersection of "what do I do?" and "where can I go?" you hear a loud "YOOOOOHOOOOOOOO!!!" coming from outside.  Your heart sinks. Your sweaty palms now grip what little you can feel of your mouse. A quick rememberance of playing minecraft on your favorite server flashes in your mind.  But gone are the days of punching trees and finding glorious diamonds. Gone are the days of advanced red stone technology and crafty agricultural designs. No. Here in rust, there are no diamonds. Only shotguns -- obtrusive, glaring, pantless shotguns. "Hlep!" you quickly type in chat, "Help!*, I think someones raiding me!". Within seconds, the ticking you thought might have been coming from an analogue clock on the other side of your room turns into a loud, life threatening boom! Again, tick tick. tick...boom! The lights come in almost as fast as the shots ringout in your ears.  You notice at the bottum right of your screen a red bar shows up. "Bleeding" it states. "BLEEDING!" it now yells. Red flashes appear all around your screen. You hold your left mouse button on your bow in the hopes of shooting something, anyting within this chaos.\n\nYou die. All you hear are the sounds of zippers. The sound: An old friend but now your mortal foe. You remember the cheerful moment of when you killed your last bear in order to have the resources required to finely craft the perfect cloth helmet.  The moment is further sweetened by the fact that the game has aknowledged your accomplishments and awarded you some raw chicken breast -- because surely chicken breasts do not come from bears. The smooth zipping sound of when you put that baby on now resonates in your ear as an abrupt, tearing off of your flesh. "[BOT] Butcher_catmike killed you using a shotgun with a shot to your head" says the white message in the middle of your screen. Now you begin again naked with only a rock in a field you have never seen before.\n\nThen you see him.  A poor, naive fellow running up to you rock in hand. "Hi! :D" he types. "Do you have some food?!".  Is he mad? Does he not realize what I just went through?  Your blood boils. You look down at the rock in your hands. "No!" you tell yourself. "I will not put him through what I just went through".  Then you realize it. You look down again in confirmation but it is unfortunately true. You. Have. No. Legs! In a moment of pure rage, you raise your rock of doom and slam it down on this beggers face! One time. Two times. Your bloodthirsty emotions get the best of you and you start to take chase as he runs yelling, "♥♥♥♥ dude, just stop!".\n\nThe man lay dead at your feet. "That's odd, I didn't see him wearing a backpack before" you think to yourself. A white message pops up at the bottum left of your screen stating, "DUDE WTF!".\n\nWelcome to rust.","February 28, 2014","true","564.1"," 34 of 44 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","34","44","0","3"

You will die. You will lose everything you worked for. The players in this game are not afraid to rub salt in the wound. Not only will they kill you on sight, they will laugh and taunt at you and tell you that you are worthless, and will make every effort to find your fresh-spawned butt so that they can just kill you on sight again. Expect all of these to happen within your first 10 hours of gameplay in Rust.\n\nIt doesn't matter if this game will come out of Early Access. It will still be a survival game in its core. You must be prepared to lose everything you worked for in a blink of an eye. If you get angry easily, or if you have a job or going to school, then this game is not for you because you need an hour or two of initial gameplay JUST to be situated, even with a friend.\n\nWhy do I have 500+ hours of gameplay and am still writing a negative review, you ask? Because I believe I am literally insane. Every week or so, I just wake up and say "Hey, maybe Rust will be fun today!" But no. It never is fun.\n\nI've had groups hunt me down, with absolutely nothing on me, for sport. I've had 5-6 rude players pickaxe my measly stone-walled base with armored doors for fun. I've had "friends" who would betray me for resources after working together. And the worst part is that I'll launch this horrible game in the next 2-3 weeks so that I can re-live the pain, because I'll somehow convince myself in the most stupid way possible, "Maybe it will be different this time!".\n\nIf you REALLY want this game to become tolerable, grab at least 1 friend (in real life) to help you start out. The more, the merrier. Solo play is near impossible.\n\nNothing is sacred in this game. Buy at your own risk.

Early access is a scam and anyone itching to buy into early access games should not do it, even if the games cycle is at a low point, which I think is what spawned this abomination in the first place. I'm not even sure its a good idea for game developers to put their games out as early access. Out of all my friends who own this game, (11 is not a high test pool to be fair) the highest amount of time played on this game is 18 hours. I'm giving Rust the brunt of my aggravation but this was the game I thought had the best potential and so I'm using it as the best example of why early access is a bad idea as a business model.\n\nServers for this game refresh all the time. Why? Because once a tribe has built their fortress and geared to the max its impossible for new players to get a foothold in the world. If you die in this game- you are likely to lose everything, especially if you die in your base. This encourages server abandonment and loss of interest in the game. Thats the worst thing about this game- theres no achievement no matter how long you toil at it.\n\nThe second worst thing about it is the fauna. Smaller game are completely indecipherable in the weeds that cover most of the off road map until you're standing on top of them. Everything else like bears and wolves have a similar camoflage when standing in cover and their aggro range is predictable and robotic. They have zero AI- they are automatons in wildlife skin clothing.\n\nThird and fourth are tied for the absolute horror of your avatar and its postal 2 grade animations. Every player looks like Maynard James Keenan and they skip across the landscape like Army Men- absolutely no pitch or yaw or realistic movements. You crouch to hack at a lump of ore sticking out of the ground with a rock or a wood handled stone hammer (and these ore veins poke out of the landscape like zits on a teenagers cheek)- and the material gets whittled away in goofy chunks.\n\nIts clear what the motive behind the game was by what the dev's got right- spot on gun mechanics and sound. Whoever did the sound for this game knows what an automatic rifle sounds like when its being reloaded- cheap and plastic. The sound of a sniper round chirping across a moonlit landscape is sufficiently creepy. And the sighting and firing has the stink of realism as well, but in this game you can't have your cake and eat it too- although bullets are appropriately deadly no matter what your armor- you may find yourself firing at an opponent who has the movement capabilities of an insect or UFO.\n\nThis game wants to be ultra realistic in its approximation of sub-modern warfare and it wants to be minecraft at the same time. It could have done better for itself if it hadn't lured gamers with the promise of completion down the road. Now that its all that closer- I don't know a single person who is interested in it.","October 31, 2014","false","43.3"," 90 of 142 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","90","142","0","3"

It said "Killed you using an MP5A4 with a shot the the head", so right away I was like "This guy had shot about 10 bullets in such a short time no way that was a legit RPM of the gun, he has no name and last of all it was to the head." I respawned to find him in my house. The only way in was the roof that wasn't there because I hadn't had enough wood to finish it. He didn't build anything to climb in so he obviously jumped over the walls to get in.

Because I couldn't build my own god damn house with out some trigger happy 12 year old who plays all god damn day walking up behind me and shooting me in the head with an LMG. Why'd I have to not go out side the nearby radius of my house? Same reason. Why did I try to build a wall? Cause before I couldn't finish building some sort of roof to keep people from jumping over, some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a gun jumped over, shot me. Got on top of my roof, shot me. Looted my house, put a sleeping bag down at my house, then put a stone barricade infront of the door to my base so I couldn't get out. Also he wrote a ♥♥♥♥ on one of my signs. The community is cancer. And for that reason I can not give this game a thumbs up. They need to put a mental health system in place. Cause 14 out of 15 people in this game will try to kill you regardless if you try to be friendly or not. Doesn't help that the devs don't do ♥♥♥♥ (Like all the developers of the Survival Genre of gaming) and the head dev thinks he's hot ♥♥♥♥ for making a survival game or something.

It's been a while since I've written a review, and this review is certainly late for the party. I've been playing since legacy, so I think my opinions are valid for such a time requiring game. Anyways, off to the review!\nNOTE: I will be reviewing experimental, because it has grown enough to be considered the main game.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOptimization: This game is generally well optimized on its own, but it can be unreliable at times because your framerate also relies on the server host. Other than that, this game can run on all current PCs, but to run it on lesser ones you must also lower your graphics(as expected). (9/10)\n\nGraphics: The game looks amazing for what it used to look like back in the 'Legacy' version of the game. I'll find myself completely absorbed and immersed because of the atmosphere this game introduces through the sunsets, the views, and the changes in screen overlay depending on the scenery. However, there are still some shading and shadow issues, which can ruin far terrain sometimes. (8/10)\n\nGameplay: The game is very fun, don't get me wrong, but I feel that it lacks in certain areas. It is time consuming and difficult to build a base good enough to let you sleep and go about the week, let alone protecting yourself from larger raid-clans and dealing with building decay. From this, it becomes very tedious and the overall result makes you sad to go back to it. In the end, you do have some good memories colaborating with the community, which is why I give this section a (7/10).\n\nOriginality: Everyone likes an original game, don't they? Well sometimes you have to borrow assets from other games to make said game original. Rust takes most of its communal elements from concepts used (and poorly delivered) in DayZ, and then combines it with other more sandbox like games to create a truly original game. You'll find yourself in wars, disputes, and towns because of the community colaboration's odd concoction with the sandbox elements. In the end, I think this game gave me some unique memories that I'll never forget. (10/10)\n\nSocial Ease and Affect: My special category for this game is social ease and affect. By this, I (of course) don't mean how many players have social deficits. Rather, I am judging how the game allows and effects communication with fellow players. Anyways, the microphone compatability along with other people being able to manipulate you when you're offline really adds a sense of realism when it comes to social interaction. You'll find yourself having similar social disputes you'd have in real life, just on a more paleolithic scale. Social interaction is easy, as it is just the hit of the V button. Also, mouths moving when words come out adds a nice touch. (10/10)\n\nThe total score of this game is an 88/100, or about a 9/10. Basically, that means it is rising far above most AAA games and is DEFINETLY worth your time, if you have a lot to spare of course.","May 6, 2015","true","307.0"," 53 of 79 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","53","79","6","0"

The legacy version was horrible, gameplay was too simple and too easy. Hackers everywhere and no way to stop them. Thankfully Garry noticed all of the flaws in the unity version that was used in the legacy version and decided to remake rust on a more up to date unity engine.\n\nI loved the new rust as it came out. Everything ran great, the gameplay was flawless, and it gave me hundreds of hours of gameplay with my friends and community to make giant bases and wage war on other groups. Recently however (last 4-5 months) it has become impossible to play. The performance has got so bad that i get an average of 8 FPS. And i got a computer that can max out everything on ultra settings and get over 100+ fps. Yes i have older hardware but 2 GTX 680's getting 10 FPS on a sandbox shooter is just wrong.\n\nGarry and the team have countlessly noted that their performance sucked. And it would be fixed this week, next week, next month, in 2 months, in 3 more weeks, etc. As i continued to wait, and wait. It was months that i could not play the game with my friends. Months i could not play something i paid for.\n\nThe more stuff they update and the more content they add it seems to only make the game worse. Every single update they have done my FPS has got worse and worse. I am a pretty patient person but when i got to wait more than 6 months for a optimization fix that still has not been released. Nope.\n\nThe game is great, addictive, and the weekly updates is nice. However the players are toxic, finding friends to game with on here is nearly impossible as everyone just shoots you in the face and insults you or stands outside your home and threaten to kill you in real life and "hack/ddos" your computer unless you give them your stuff. I am one of those players that tried very hard to be friendly, not shoot people on sight, help new people with gear and show them how to play, only for them to use the very bow and arrow i gave them to kill me.\n\nGarry/Facepunch/Rust Team need to realize that 80%+ of their players have older hardware. And a lot of them have nVidia. I have tried playing this on my AMD computer and the FPS difference is sickening. It seems like they are providing performance support for their own choice of hardware and the rest of them can go shove it.\n\nif this games performance is fixed i may change my review but as of now thats all ig ot to say.","November 16, 2015","false","523.7"," 161 of 268 people (60%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","60","161","268","19","18"

Fear, rage, anger, devastation.. The list goes on!\n\nLegacy started to get boring with no updates and hackers everywhere with a new hack/trick every hour of the day, so I stopped playing for a while. I didn't like the new version as it was laggy and boring the first time I played it.\n\nA few months later I went back and fell in love all over again. It is an awesome game, you meet some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and some helpful people. There is so much to do/learn on the new version that it takes a while to get your base up to scratch and ammo/weapons etc. This is why I stopped playing, the weekly wipes bored the crap out of me. I will 100% go back to the game, just waiting for more updates and hopefully the weekly wipes will have stopped.\n\nFinding a good server is so hard, but once you have one that's good the game becomes brilliant.\n\nThis is the best game I have ever or ever will purchase.\n","June 18, 2015","true","517.4"," 39 of 56 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","39","56","4","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deejld/recommended/252490/","deejld","Deej","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deejld/","233 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIMO probably the best current and most promising early access Survival game on Steam.  Rust has all of the necessary elements already in the game for a solid Survival game and is only adding to that pool with every update.  I highly recommend you check out the Dev Blog which is updated every Thursday.\n\nThe Good...\n\n-Updates every week\n-Developers care about cheaters and ban them constantly if correctly reported (check twitter @rusthackreport)\n-Rewarding gameplay (pvp is important, resources are crucial and every encounter gets your heartrate going)\n-Extremely fun crafting/build system (and is still growing with more options for players)\n-Unique biomes that impact what resources are most available (where you decide to try and live matters)\n-Combat is brutal and has a high skill cap (practice makes perfect but there is always someone better)\n-Support for Twitch Streamers already in early access\n-Optional cosmetics are available\n-UI is easy to use and understand considering how deep and broad it is\n-Game is HARD (might turn off casual players) but rewards those seeking something more in your face\n-Optimisation is ongoing and always getting better\n-Audio work is solid both world ambience and weaponry\n\nThe Bad...\n\n-Really hard to solo, you have to play a lot smarter if you are trying to play alone.  Bigger groups have an advantage\n-Not really new player friendly, make sure you read some guides before you get started because otherwise you are bound to be completely lost as there are no real ingame tutorials or hints on what you should be doing\n-AI for animals is very stupid, but the roadmap plan for them should change that in 2016\n-Weapons IMO are changed too often, I understand it's early access though so can't knock them too hard for this.\n\nConclusion...\n\nRust rewards players seeking a deep hardcore experience Survival game.  The building/crafting system is deep, robust, and ever growing with more updates planned.  The frequency I see the game updating, dishing out bans for cheaters, amount of new content being added all tell me the developer really cares about their game and it is only going to keep getting better.  While Rust might not be for everyone, it does not try to pretend to be anything other than what it is, a brutal, challenging, unforgiving game where you can be riding on cloud nine having a really strong base, only to have a crew roll up and take it all away in a matter of minutes if their offense is better than your planned defense.  I've not had time to put a whole lot of time into Rust just yet but in the little I have and hundreds of hours I've watched my favorite Twitch streamers play I have a lot of praise for Rust and what it has already been able to accomplish.  Knowing that this is still in early access and is already such a solid experience, I can't wait to see where this game is a year from now.","December 26, 2015","true","150.1"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","2"

First, the game is wildly addictive and fun. I play on my own low population server since most players are jerks. I'm hoping they add in some more environmental threats and NPCs to give people something to do other than kill and grief eachother.\n\nWithin the last few months the game has finally surpassed legacy in playability and fun. The choice Facepunch made to basically start over is paying off. We're starting to see new stuff added much more frequently and the Workshop is really cool if you're into cosmetic items.\n\nThe game is much more tedious if you're a solo player, but it's also rewarding to build a whole base by yourself.\n\nEvery time I play I'm struck by how beautiful the game has become. Just running across the island lets you see so many amazing landscapes.\n\nFinally, I love the weekly dev blogs. I've learned so much about the development process from keeping up with this game. Facepunch does the best job of listening to the community while filtering out all the idiots that are constantly complaining.

Now, I'm not sure just how great it was since I didn't run into any players that weren't sleeping, but I'm sure I was having fun in some way. The house building mechanics are definitely more improved now, but I feel like it was ten times harder to navigate and find my friend. The severe lack of landmarks across a majority of Hapis had me searching for nearly two hours. Also, we just up and find C4 blueprints now? I feel like I've been cheated out of my time/effort from the old days when hunting a C4 down just to copy it to a schematic was like end game stuff, and now this? Damn. Overall, I just hope this game will feature less kids next time I get on and there's more than my friend and I on our server we chose. It'll be really awesome to meet all of the new and interesting players that will KOS because they've swrorn to role play as bots from a late-90's fps games like Quake.\n\n**OLD REVIEW**\nIf I had payed $5 more, I could have just bought 7 Days To Die Instead when I had originally blown $20 to buy this. I regret nearly every hour put into this early access game so far when I look back at it. I'm even referring to the hours that were spent in laughter of stupid things company and I were doing. It was all for naught, and Facepunch only updates this game once every so months now. I think I invested a better $20 into Valkyria Chroncles just the other day.\n\nPoint: only buy this game if you feel like you hate yourself, and can't afford an extra $5-$10 for a better early access game. Actually, just do yourself a favor, spend under $10, and get 100% Orange Juice instead. That seems to go on sale every other week for less than $4 to boot. It's more playable with friends minus wanting to pound nails into your male reproductive organ.\n\nAlso, the community is full of annoying kids. That's the worst part about it.\n\n**UPDATE**\nThe meta-game isn't fun either. It's just like playing the real game, except now it's just a text adventure with kids.","November 8, 2014","false","132.7"," 75 of 121 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","75","121","0","68"

As the sun set on this world devoid of humans a flicker of light caught my eye. There it was at last! Humanity! A sign of life! Quickly I made my way over to them where I was then held at gun point by two players. I begged for a sign of mercy, I explained that I was merely a lone survivor looking to group up to take on the world. It took some convincing but under their wing I went. They taught me how to build my first house. They found me food, clothing and weapons, all things I so desperately needed to survive. How ever food was scarce, ammo was low and people were slowly moving in on our territory. I quickly learned that this relationship wouldn’t work, I had to survive. It was me or them and I was playing to live, because of this I had to do one of the hardest things, take the other two out, with the very gun that was given to me! It was me or them and I had to survive. Its situations like this that make this game so worth while, to observe how other people act towards one another when pitted against starvation and limited resources. The results will scare you. Rust is a survival open world crafting game that is currently available for PC and in this players are dropped into a world with no direction, no objective, no help. You are simply put into the world and forced to learn. For some the game is a lot to take in and I can admit that even I was overwhelmed in the beginning but you grow into it, and once familiarize with your world, you get lost in it. Rust is a time consumer in that you are always prone to attack, players work with one another or work against one another in trying to take the resources that you have worked so hard to obtain. Rust is a high risk high reward game in where a death results in the loss of everything putting you back at square one. Its not for the faint of heart but a definite worth of the 20$ price tag it holds. I find myself discovering new areas, people and structures in Rust everyday that keeps me coming back. I would definitely recommend Rust, not only for the game play that is easily learned but the feeling the game gives you when you set out to raid another playing and the adrenaline rush that comes from knowing that you might not come back from this alive.","February 27, 2014","true","159.2"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","29","40","0","0"

Basically, if you need to read reviews to find out if this game is for you, it isn't. It likely means you don't have a group of friends that play it and you aren't playing it already.\n\nI know it's a survival game, and that you have to expect to die, a lot. The issue is the massive imbalance inherent in this particular game.\n\nTo give you an idea:\nIn the 12 hours I have played, I was killed about 4 times. In the 3 hours I played before being killed, I ran around and hid, chopped down trees in the night, tried to find rocks and animals, finally built a rudimentary shelter. Put down a sleeping bag. Walked out of my "base" and was shot. That person then destroyed my sleeping bag (spawn point), took everything I had, then camped there for when I came back and kept killing me. I had a wooden axe on me and this person had an automatic rifle.\n\nI was working towards the "having fun" part of the game where I would get to try and craft neat items and figure out how the game worked... but it was near impossible to get there.  I certainly am not going to continue to play the same part of the game over and over until, by chance, the 100 players that are 74 levels higher than me decide not to kill me. Everyone that wasn't naked that I ran into, killed me instantly... along with any other new player near me.\n\nThis isn't just one single case, it  happened 4 different times on 3 different servers. People chatting in game say the same thing and experienced players say "stop crying", "learn the hard way" etc... So, if you have a bunch of buddies that play the game, it is probably a lot of fun. For me, it ended up being basically a Call of Duty sniping clone, or a schoolyard bully simulator.\n\nUntil the devs put in some type of mechanic to allow the new players to advance, don't expect the community to give you a good game experience. Which is unfortunate because you would think that smart experienced players would realize that only by nurturing new players will the game make money and be able to grow.","April 20","false","11.6"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","30","42","0","1"

That was in March of 2015 (I think) Anyway, I have played Rust for almost a 1000 hours at this point. It has been one of the best games I've ever played. The dev team tries to fix bugs as fast as possible. They are active on reddit and reading the communities suggestions. They are OPEN to good and bad opinions. They are very transparent. They are aware if something they put in makes the game worse or better. FacePunch is probably the best dev team I've ever encountered. I watched a stream yesterday and a FacePunch dev was in a official server deleting bases of those who were glitching inside rocks.\n\nIf you have 20 bucks to spend and you want endless hours of fun. Buy it. No it's not fun if you lone wolf. Get a few buddies. Buy it. Build. Have fun! You can build massive castles or just small secretive shacks. In Rust you play however you want.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NovaTheGreat/recommended/252490/","NovaTheGreat","Nova | kickback.com","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NovaTheGreat/","58 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRust is a game about survival. But that takes time. Initially, it's just about death. It's about freezing to death, and starving to death, being shot to death and getting bitten to death; occasionally mixing things up a little by slipping on a warm radiation coat and fading faster than your faith in humanity after being stabbed in the back by a supposed friend's hatchet. Sometimes you get gored to death. Other times, bored to death. It's not easy, surviving post-apocalyptic civilisation with nothing but a rock - especially when your enemies have guns, and double-especially in a game that makes you work just to earn a pair of basic trousers.\n\nEven this early into development, Rust's mix of DayZ and Minecraft (the easiest comparison, though Wurm Online is more apt) has won it no shortage of fans - some of them not even psychopaths, hackers and trolls on the hunt for new victims to murder and mock over voice chat. It's the kind of game that's less a shooter than an engine designed to tell stories. Those stories are mostly, as ever, in the field of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥om, but there's scope for some humanity amongst all the pranks and murder. It's also a world that focuses on demanding effort rather than promising to reward it: starting players out naked and hungry and alone, dangling the potential of going on to build forts, craft weapons, and finally savour the air at the top of the food chain.","May 28, 2015","true","360.7"," 40 of 60 people (67%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","67","40","60","11","2"

I'm quite upset I even bothered to purchase this game when it was advertised around as a fun survival minecraft clone, whereas it's truly just a grief and grind fest.

It had so much potential but the developers have changed the game and not for the better, I played today for the first time in a year and the game felt even less finished than previously. The graphics are better but the whole design, UI, controls have become clunky and guttered. There was less hacking but everyone seemed to have get a hard on for killing people who held nothing but a rock.\n\nYes Rust is about survival and no rules apply but there it is more fun when there is collaboration not just mindless killing, the backwards step combined with the 12 year olds lusting for killing makes me dislike what Rust has become.\n\nEDIT: Came back after a friend bought the game and tried it out, some new features were interesting and everything looked better however, the graphics are much more intensive though and my computer struggled to handle it.

With the ongoing development of this game I have seen the devs actually remove more content than they add.  Many of the things removed were major parts of the game(zombies, rad towns, etc).  The survival is way to easy resulting in most of my enjoyment of the game coming from my interactions with other palyers but the community is becoming more difficult to enjoy as the game goes on.  I found it nearly impossible to avoid greifing and rading by glitchers and people cheating their way into my bases.  I have also found that once you go offline pretty much anyone can have their way with your base and your items which you worked so hard to get becasue there is no defense for offline players.  There is also no chance of having complex interaction with anyone in this game due to the extremely toxic community as you are simply shot on sight by everyone, this removes the entertainment value of being able to communicate and interact with other players like the game intended.\n\nTLDR- Survival is way to easy and the community sucks leaving nothing to enjoy in the game itself","January 10","false","81.0"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","1"

A year later it's broken, with bad combat mechanics, laggy, still poorly optimized AND it's almost unplayable for solo players or even small teams. So the only positive point for me (fun experience) went down the drain.\n\nIn other words, with the new features added these last couple of months that can only be built and maintained if you're part of a 5-6 men group or more, Rust became almost unplayable for casual solo players, including myself. I can't really be bothered nor do I have the time to commit to this game to such an extent. Organized teams get most airdrops (which contain op gear), helicopter drops as well (which will soon contain exclusive parts for turrets according to the devblog), build large bases with space for all the high capacity furnaces and other processing facilities, quarries etc.\n\nAs a solo player, you can't get online and just gather some resources, build a small house, put a couple of furnaces and start collecting stuff - no, you'll get raided as soon as some team's scout spots your house and decides to tear it down with a couple of C4 charges (that you, as a solo player, don't have access to).\n\nOne last point: the community. Russians, children, hackers, sociopaths, you name it - Rust has it.\n\n","October 25, 2015","false","176.4"," 134 of 228 people (59%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","59","134","228","36","21"

Go for it and gather an army, you want to be an evil ♥♥♥ and take over the world killing everyone in sight? GO FOR IT! The players make the laws here!\nUnless you play on a pve server to just build bases (which is kinda boring)\nI cannot wait to see this game progress.

Tons of future updates on weaponry and vehicles zomg cannot wait! this game will grow to become one of the best game you'll ever play.\n\nAlso check out my videos of my adventures everytime I turn on rust, You cannot believe how much fun this game is even if you aren't playing the game correctly. the interaction between players in this game is kodak memories.\n\n+Awsome open world gameplay multiplayer online only\n+weapon crafting and base building heck yes\n+More stuff coming\n+Its only alpha and has so much\n+Players set the law\n+server holds up to the hundreds\n+maps will be huge, vehicles, more weapons inc.\n+Animals all drop chicken breast\n\n\n-Graphics are ok, could be better, everyone always turns off the grass so its impossible to hide in it so perhaps it'll be perma on in the future\n-night only last 15 mins or so\n-too many hackers atm","January 3, 2014","true","199.4"," 94 of 157 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","94","157","0","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aeroisticon/recommended/252490/","aeroisticon","aeroisticon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aeroisticon/","49 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDate purchased: April 21, 2014\nDate Reviewed: Jan 7, 2016\nReview Updated:May 6, 2016\nTime played legacy: about 20 hours\nTime played new Rust: 100+ hours\n\nGraphics:\nIt feels like the game almost can't decide whether it is cartoony or realistic, but I know one thing for sure and that one thing is that there is absolutely no personality to it. The visuals are pretty much like the opposite of legacy Rust. Legacy Rust's graphics were pretty bad, yet they had a tremendous amount of personality. New Rust's graphics are OK at best when they are turned up in comparison to other modern games, but they feel like they have no personality or original atmosphere.\n\nThe graphics on the terrain are pretty sharp, some of the visual effects are impressive and the lighting is great. The game looks good when you are standing still. But when moving, there is very clear, ugly texture pop in, trees look horrendous at any distance, and you can see blotchy shadows just appear out of no where. It all just feels very unstable and super sloppy. Graphics just don't feel crisp or smooth at all.\n\nSound:\nIt's still in alpha, so I'm not going to be too hard on it. But don't expect any beautiful orchestrated music or realistic sounds in general. Practically every sound in the game sounds like a pitched up or pitched down version of each other. One thing I do admire about the sound design is the realism of gunshots. The pop of the muzzle actually causes you to fear the person who is shooting at you.\n\nThe HUD sounds are nice and I can appreciate the fact that crouching mutes the walking noise allowing for a stealthy playstyle.\n\nGameplay:\nGunplay in particular where Rust excels. The gunplay is very realistic and challenging even if it can be unbalanced from time to time. Melee fighting is also pretty fun when it does occur. Crafting is a rather repetitious and grindy task, and can get old quickly if you don't have a lot of patience. There is almost no sense of discovery, as procedural generation creates very generic and repetitive scenes. The first few times you play, the post-apocalyptic feel will feel great, but sooner or later you will find yourself sighing at the sight of an abandoned town or partly destroyed bridge. You collect blueprints and items from barrels, which spawn comepletely randomly. This adds to the grindy feel of the game and subtracts the discovery feel even more.\n\nThe game feels very empty at the current state and it feels like once you see all the game has to offer, the game just becomes very useless. It's basically the same cycle over and over again, not allowing for variation.\nSpawn--->Collect items--->Build a base--->Loot monuments--->Get raided--->Repeat\nThere currently is not much PvE which really hurts the replay value of the game, but I am looking forward to seeing what Facepunch has in store as far as PvE goes. The entire game is basically a large battlefield at it's current state.\n\nThe AI is godawful and is possibly the game's biggest flaw. Bears and wolves run through landscapes, aren't reactive to anything and have horrible animations. There is very few variations in AI, and all of the models look pretty bad. It's embarrassing and disappointing how Facepunch has yet to even address fixing this when the AI has been this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ since new Rust was introduced.\n\nCommunity:\nRust has gotten a reputation for having an absolutely horrendous community. And it has that reputation for a reason. The community is probably worse than any other game community combined. Hackers run rampant, people will be ♥♥♥♥♥ for no reason, people kill you for no reason, ect. The game's community is one major flaw that I'm afraid the dev's can't fix.\n\nStability & Optimization:\nLike many other early access games, this game runs like a nightmare. There isn't much else to say. If you plan on buying this game, make sure you don't have any sub-par hardware or else you are going to suffer. There are tons of bugs, many of which get fixed relatively fast though.\n\nGame Support:\nFor anybody that is unfamiliar with Facepunch's support, it is pretty mediocre. All I have to say about that.\n\nVerdict:\nRust has a very strong foundation to be a great game. It has some good ideas, they just aren't executed well at all. With proper tweaking and removal of the grindy feel, I think this could quite possibly be one of the better games in recent release though. But the entire game still just feels very incomplete and sluggish at the stage it's in. If you are debating on buying, save your money. Wait until the game nears completion that way you will really feel that you got your money's worth. I honestly can't say that I would recommend this game at the state it's at.","January 7","false","197.1"," 43 of 66 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","43","66","3","0"

I'd like to write a lot of thing but i don't want to be harsh.\n\nPros+ Game is really fun even it has a lot of frustrating points\n+ It has potential\n\nNeutral= Good time killer. My hips...\n\nCons- Bloodthirsty, disrespectful savage community\n- You can't play "Rust Legacy" anymore Apparently you should select it on Properies window/Betas tab. It'll overwrite your current Rust, so, remember to backup your game first. (thanks to Sphyro for their kind comment)\n- Optimization problems. Plus, if the server you're playing is full of buildings, you'll loss 5-10 fps more.\n- Still in alpha since 2013 Q4\n- Gameplay is unbalanced in my humble opinion. If you're playing alone or with a few friends in a crowded server, good luck. You'll be ravaged. They will raid your house over and over again easily. Are you naked and unarmed? Who cares, you'll be killed and looted and they could even eat you! Are you naked but you have a mere bone club or wearing something while showing your ♥♥♥♥♥ off everyone you meet? Who cares, you will be killed by a OP NPC helicopter!!! (who added this event anyway, that's not fun at all! Especially for weak, developing players).\n\nConsequenceDon't buy it yet. It has a lot of problems and most importantly, community is toxic. Kill or be killed. Loot 'em all. That's it. Each of them are killing machines. Everyone is maniac in this game (good servers and players excluded, which i never encountered).\n\nFacepunch Studios must fix the game performance and give all of the players another events in-game to focus. Otherwise that's just a Hokuto no Ken or Mad Max with good sceneries and without vehicles (except that goddammit attack heli!)\n\nMostly played Rust Alpha, win.796.47 before writing this.

It had zombies, which have since been scrapped.\nIt had pretty good building system, and it was fun to build huge house or fortress with your friend, while still defending it, so that other players wouldn't raid it.\n\nRaiding, one big part of the game. What is yours, is mine. After airdrop, you might have been lucky, and gotten recipe for C4 crafting. Then you would've crafted few explosives from hardly earned materials. Then, waited for a while. Gathered your group, and silently found best entrance to enemy's fortress. You raided their home, stole all you needed, and ran. Next day, this might happen to you too.\n\nRust Legacy, the old version of the game, is still available to play, if you so desire. It's basic survival at it's finest;\nSpawn in a forest, start chopping trees, build your first shed. Start gathering materials to build bigger home.\nAfter a while, you'll start getting metal materials, which is more durable, and thus harder to raid by others.\nYou should have crew, and each member should have a weapon. For first, melee weapons will do. But later on, you'll find weapons, or recipes to craft them. Once you'r crew has those weapons, you can start raiding, or create huge castle.\nBut that's pretty much what legacy is all about, it just ends. After a while, there is nothing more to do, and if you don't want to start from beginning, or keep raiding, it's all you've got.\n\nDevelopers saw this, and started building Rust from the very beginning,\nThis is now called Rust Experimental. While it still lacks some features that Legacy has, it's going to be greater, bigger, more awesome in every way.\n\nExperimental has better graphics, if you care about those. It has randomly generated map, and improved crafting.\nSome day, it will be better than at the moment, but it is still fun. For now, if your'e looking for more complete version, I would play Legacy. Every update to Experimental adds features, and soon it will be the better version. And boy it will be good. This is one of the gems of early access.","January 24, 2015","true","99.6"," 58 of 93 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","58","93","6","1"

It's developing quite fast.\n\nWhat's good about this game?\n- Graphics (Really amazing graphics, weather and effects.)\n- Sound (Realistic and atmospheric sound. It's really necessary in order to get that "real" feeling.)\n- Gameplay (There is a lot of things that you can do. Craft, hunt, build, raid, kill & meet people. What's really important is that it doesn't get boring fast. Actually I'm still not bored of it after 150 hours.)\n- Option to choose between playing Legacy version & new version.\n- Good anti-cheat in new version compared to Legacy version.\n\nWhat's bad about this game?\n- Playing alone. It's really hard to play alone because 90% of people on server are in clans and you really have to spend a lot of time collecting resources and trying to build a safe base. Every single base is raidable but when you are alone it's hard to make a big and "safe" one.\nHowever take in mind that this is an open-world multiplayer game with a large community and because of that it's really easy to find people to play with together. But some people love to be lone wolves and survive alone.\n\nOverall\nIt's a really good game. As I previously said there is plenty of things that you can do. I don't know what to write anymore. You just have to play the game and experience it for yourself.\n\nJust a little tip: If you want to stay away from people, go into winter biome. It's hard to survive in winter biome but it's well worth it when you do. My 2 bases in normal biome got raided as soon as I logged off but when I built one in winter biome, all the people that were near it came knocking on my doors asking for food because they are starving. But then I fell into water and froze to death.

He said "We build video games not anti cheat, you can write your complaint to EAC." - Thanks\nWhy hackers really exist... People who play legit, spend a lot of time in game. Hackers only show up to grief and ruin peoples fun, they aren't trying to win. They are only there to make the fun you are having, go away.\n\nThere are so many great games out there that put more effort into anti cheat. Also, it's not because its early access. Rust is basically done, they will just keep adding content to keep people interested.\nI pay close attention to updates. The past 2-3 months, the devs haven't really done anything creative on THEIR end. It's mostly been stuff that the community pointed out and wanted fixed or added.\n\nAt the end of the day, Face Punch Studios makes a fat paycheck every month because hackers buy their game 3-4 times a month. Eventually anti cheat will ban hackers, but they can buy Rust for 2$-7$ bucks and cheat again for another 70-300 Hours.\n\nThis is why I can't recommend Rust.\n- Nick\ntwitch.tv/nickiamx","May 23","false","147.7"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","2"

The next day I ran back and forth between my house and a place known as 'Rad Town' (where lots of good items spawned regularly) for a few hours (while occasionally dying from an aimbot hacker who would headshot me with a pistol from impossible distances). After 5 hours, I had gotten the best gun in the game with full attachments, and lots of resources. Then about 20 minutes after getting the best gun, one of the 5+ hackers on the server flew into my house with noclip, instantly headshotted me, took all of my weapons and resources (thus erasing all progress I had made), and then flew off to find the next victim. And apparently this sort of thing happens regularly across all of the servers in Rust, from what I'm reading on forums and such.\n\n*DO NOT buy this game until they manage to get the infestation of hackers under control.

Besides waste your time, at least in Minecraft/Terraria you have a persistent world where you can keep your stuff and you can move your stuff between worlds with your personal character's inventory...\n\nThere's quite some clever things in Rust like the persistent randomly generated characters based on your steam ID, the differences between the crafting system of this game and other survival games out there, how vast the world is even if it's pretty choresome to explore it trying to find animals to kill for 20+ minutes, With the bugs and glitches, the horrid performance, the chore fetch crafting, PVP raiding, constant 1 GB+ updates every two or three days which lag your computer horribly when installing and unpacking (Non-SSD) and lack of any real progress at all the game definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nMaybe the game will be more playable and will actually run decently in 2 more years, who knows, all i know is that the bad core mechanics will most likely never go away so someday we will hopefully have a non-buggy, optimized Rust that has pretty bad gameplay mechanics but people will still love, I would probably love having to do the exact same crafting over and over or ganking little kids after farming an AK for 5 hours if i didn't have any better games to play.","August 15, 2015","false","6.1"," 55 of 89 people (62%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","62","55","89","8","24"

I bought this game in March, 2014.\n\nIt's been some time now, and I would like to share some of my experiences with this great game in this review.\n\nBack then, there was no "new" Rust, no new engine, just the good old Rust. I have 200 hrs on Legacy, time in which I made new friends, people who I speak to even today, just because of this game.\n\nHere I've made enemies(mostly Russians), who have been killing me all that time, hunting me in the mountains while I was trying to get away. I can even remember the first time when I was hiding in my shack and got a visit from 3 ruskies, who kept telling me "Open duur!" and choped at my wooden door. That was the first time my heart pumped hard in that game, and the first time I got killed. I didn't know how the game really worked back then, so I thought that if you disconnected, your body dissapears, so i took all the important stuff and disconnected, to find the next day I was dead.\nHell, I even went past 2 guys with kevlar sleeping on the ground, in a shack with a open door, and I thought that they were dead. Only If I wasn't a fool back then. Still, good memories.\n\nProblem was, that after a month and a little, time when i put almost 200 hours in the game, the Great Remake happened.\nNewman decided that they couldn't continue the game on that engine, so they started once again, from scratch, on Unity 5.\nThis is where the "dead time" starts.\nAfter about a year, in March 2015, the game was pretty much in the same state as Legacy, it was pretty playable, but I still waited for some more time. Around summer till the end of 2015 I've put another 100 hrs in the game. I didn't play as much as before, since it was in heavy development, and I really didn't feel like playing with the same excitement, since the "Legacy" feel was once gone. At least it was still fun.\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWell, the game progressed in the right direction and was amazing. I can say that I can have a blast while playing this.\nAt least, I thought I can have. Everything was somewhat good, until last week, when they updated the game, so that there is a chance of 50%, that you can become a woman. They first made my ♥♥♥♥♥ smaller with their random features, and now, they might just take it away. Great.\nWell, to my surpise, I connected to a server today, after a break, and to my horror of pressing TAB, I see that I am a woman. Why? Because Garry doesn't know how to implement a feature, and just says "♥♥♥♥ you." and "♥♥♥♥ this."\n\nSo... yeah, Garry decided to bring in a forced gender, based on your Steam ID, so it's tied to your account forever.\nHe even states that they know that this might make us "not play the game anymore, but whatever, we are still going to force it, because you aren't worth ♥♥♥♥. We already have your money. So deal with it, or go somewhere else."\n\nHe also uses as an excuse the fact that "We are just not used to be forced", while saying that this also "Technically nothing has changed, since half the population was already living with those feelings." So basically he says that 50% of the playerbase were women who played as male. Only if that was any close to accuarte. He just made things worse for the majority, good job. The way Garry expresses on this is just some kind of a femministic point of view, in my opinion. He is just shoving this down everyones throats because "♥♥♥♥ you."\n\nI've never seen anything like this in my entire life, such ideology being forced in a video game, It makes me wonder what is next, for a game without any freedom when it comes to identity, where you cannot even identify with your own gender.\nI find it uncomfortable to be forced to play with a caracter who I cannot even relate to, even in gender. All of this is just some kind of social experiment for Garry, who thinks of us like some lab rats. He does controversiall ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like this, and wants to see how people react to it, what they say, how the cry about it like me, etc. Not to mention the others who are laughing their asses off because they still have their sausage, while the others lost it.\n\nIf I recommend this game? If you want to be a lab rat, go ahead, you are welcome to give Garry your money.\nIf you do not, then I recommend to keep your wallet closed for some time, and wait to see if there are any changes done.\n\n(I will UPDATE this review IF THERE IS ANY CHANGE TO THIS "FORCED GENDER" SYSTEM. But I am very skeptical about it, since from what I know, it's permanent.)\n\n---THIS IS ONLY MY OPINION OVER THIS - I DO KNOW THAT PEOPLE MIGHT TAKE THIS REVIEW AS BEING CHILDISH AND/OR A WHINNY ♥♥♥♥♥, THING THAT I AM NOT SURPRISED ABOUT, AFTER ALL, I ONLY WHINED ABOUT THIS FORCED GENDER THING---\n\nTo conclude, that feature was only added to make this game more controversial, only to bring more attention to it.\nThey also state that "if they gave us a choice, it wouldn't improve the gameplay in any way."\n\n*They are right, they wouldn't improve the gameplay, but at least they wouldn't make it worse, by forcing it.*\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE 15 / MAY / 2016:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo, I've found they added skirts for women, but at least noone will be forced to wear clothes to the coresponding gender, so at least there won't be anyone to ♥♥♥♥♥ about it on Reddit.\n\nAlso, for the "gender thing" I had a suggetion. Ok, so noone will be able to get a choice? Well, as they said, rust is not about identity. Unfortunatly the thing that makes this about identity is the fact that you have that certain character forever. So, it will pretty much represent you (to an extent) in game, for the rest of you exsitence. The only solution I have for this is to randomize the characters for everyone each month (or some given interval).\n\nThis way Rust will truly not be about identity.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you for reading.","April 16","false","360.8"," 57 of 93 people (61%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","61","57","93","6","1"

And allowing you to build your shelters with an adequate amount of control is a definite plus.\n\nMy biggest issue though was it being intended for both PvE and PvP, since the AI's are way too harmless to consider being a survival game. It's definitly a PvP game, which for me, this game is not yet good enough to buy simply for PvP.

The game itself is mostly brilliant. The world is large but not too expansive and the survival and building mechanics are fun and interesting and a good challange. The game hits the toilet when you factor players into it. It feels as though you must have someone on at literally every hour of the day to stop other players blowing up your base and stealing all you progress and after the third or fourth time it can be really deflating. also the fact that players can kill your character while you are offline means that if another player has progressed to the point they can reach your safe area they will most certainly take you out and lift whatever gear you have. The majority of players like this also remove your spawn casting you back to the wilderness. With going on a tirade, the game is fun, but you will not spend long on it without a large group of friends willing to be the bullies of the server.","January 16, 2014","false","31.4"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Too bad it is plagued by hackers to the point where it is unplayable. I have gathered guns, resources, constructed towers, but in the time I have been playing I have lost everything to hackers a multitude of times. I have been killed inside my enclosed house by a headshot where bullets aren't supposed to pierce walls, killed many times by hackers with aimbots that will headshot you from across the map, speed hackers, jump hackers. There is rarely a day where you don't meet a hacker at least every hour. If you're lucky they won't kill you, if your lucky they'll only kill you. Although infuriating, that isn't even the worst of the hacking. Around every two weeks a hacker comes on each of the official servers and spams that he will cleanse the servers. He then runs a hack that allows him to kill everyone, destroy all crates, and furnaces, essentially leveling you entire week's work in minutes, and eliminating all items in game. In the 2 weeks+ I have played this game this has already happened twice. There are hackers with keyloggers advertising selling keylogged accounts. This game is so broken, and its ok because it is in alpha. Listen to me when I say this, save yourself the nerve and don't buy the game until a beta comes out that patches the hacks. You will lose everything not to raids like the game was supposed to be played, but by hackers.","February 26, 2014","false","168.8"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","2"

But don't forget it's survival ,if u get ganked by people your loss :) . Basicly here is a small tutorial for starters , and to make a ideea before buying.\n\nThe 2 Moast Important Things:\n1.I Recommend a Microphone! By the time you write friendly usually you get a bullet in the head!\n2.Not all people are Friendly Be CAUTION , i recomend stay away from them!\n\nAnyway,\nU spawn naked , with  a rock , a torch , 2 first aid (first aid is used only to stop bleeding! ).\n\nWhat should you do first?\n-Well you start with 1250 food that should last a while but the main this is find some food (pig / chicken / rabit the only ones u can kill with rock easy) , after that gather wood (wood should be gathered if available from the wood stacks not from trees) , and finally get some stones (they help you make the stone axe wich is quite usefull and good , if u know the game you can get to that first)\n\n-How to make a house and where?\nFrist of all the idle zone for a house is near resources , zombies , and places to loot from .This is a hard question to say , there are 2 ways of building a house:\n\nA. Build it in the midle of the resources to get them asap and raise a huge tower surounded by spikes.\nB. Find a place near resources in mountains and build so it's not very visible to others (i will explain why below).\n\nIf you are the kind of person that will play this game 12/24 hours a day i sugest A. But if you play less i sugest a hidden house because the wood door breakes easy , the metal door easyer xD (don't forget doors dissapear in a few days u always have to fix them with either wood either metal fragments)..\n\nEverything is build on rust to be destroyed easy (one thing i don't enjoy that much) , and if you play on a sleeping server (normal mode) , you have to always take care of your character where he sleeps , the house to be guarded , cause u may wake up naked again :)  .\n\nOk so you build your house what now?!\nSearch for bloody weapons it's a survival after all !  :) You can get these from:\n\nA: Crafting (with metal , melten in the furnance)\nB: Kill other players to get them (it may be hard considering u have a axe or a stone).\nC: Kill zombies , this is actually not hard after you have a bow , you have to just one shot the moast. The black ones die from 4.  From zombies you can get basicly everything weapons , bules , blueprints (blueprints are used to learn stuff like leather , kevlar , m4 , 250 pistol , shotgun , F1 grenades , Explosives etc etc etc) and many many more stuff don't want to ruin surprises :) .\nD: Loot places , this is the easyest asuming there are no radiations in the area ^^. Loot places have boxes that have the same drops as zombies.\n\nWarning , if you have for example a M4 weapon from a fallen player , and you don't have the blueprint you can still learn it. How?! Well it's simple you need to have a salvage kit and paper , dropped from boxes , zombies , players.\n\n\nOh yeah and to warn you one last thing silencers  lower the range xD i died a few times not knowing.\n\nThese are actually the main and base stuff u need to know , telling more will spoil the fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/viperior/recommended/252490/","viperior","Viperior","http://steamcommunity.com/id/viperior/","130 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOne of the most exciting games I have played in years. The thing I love about Rust is that your actions are meaningful. The players shape the in-game world by being able to free build structures anywhere there is flat land. No rules PVP makes your interactions with other players very important.\n\nYou first lay foundations and then walls, doorways, windows and stairs anywhere you want within your structure. It's not the level of freedom granted in a game like Minecraft, because the grid system you build with is larger than Minecraft's and you can't dig into earth or place just any kind of item. However, the system still offers a lot of customization and creativity that will appeal to players who enjoy virtual architecture. Build windows high up in your tower to shoot down on enemy players trying raid you. Erect spike wall barriers and even build a gate and fence around your entire town. How you build will determine how easily other players can break in, stealing everything you have but your tears. And, of course, you can build any shape or size house you can gather materials for.\n\nOn PVP servers, anyone can be a threat, even that naked guy running across the field holding a rock. Will you kill him and take his resources or befriend him and gain a new ally? On my second day playing Rust, I randomly encountered two players travelling down a road. I nearly shot them on sight because I thought they were zombies. Just before pulling the trigger, I hear them calling out to me that they are friendly. I introduced myself and they ended up leading me back to their city and giving me 1000 wood to start building a nice-sized home. Had I decided to attack them, I very well may have started a war between our villages instead. What I chose to do in that situation really mattered and changed the game for me.\n\nThe progression is also quite fun. You start off completely naked, with nothing but a rock, torch, and bandage. Your first day will likely involve chasing pigs through a field trying to smash them with your rock and harvest some meat before you starve to death. Without clothes you get cold at night, causing you to burn calories faster as your body shivers, making a campire at night a must. I hope you didn't forget to gather enough wood and food to last you through the night, because stumbling around in the dark (at least during a new or crescent moon) can turn you into a quick snack for bears and wolves.\n\nIf you aren't ripped apart by wild animals or starve to death, you can gather enough materials to build yourself a hunting bow and arrows. Collect enough fibers from animal pelts to fashion yourself cloth armor for protection against the cold. Later you can craft a pistol and ammo to truly enter the modern age of weapons. You will progress through weapons and armor that start in the stone age and end with kevlar armor and laser-sighted assault rifles.\n\nIn conclusion, this game rocks. Don't let some of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking screenshots turn you off. They did for me for a while, but I eventually had to try the game based on things I had read about it. I now consider Rust one of the coolest and engaging games I have played in my career, and that is saying a lot considering how new this game is and how much exciting development is yet to come for the Rust community.","December 20, 2013","true","174.1"," 51 of 83 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","51","83","0","0"

There is zero insintive to not shoot someone on sight and most of the people that play seem to be greifing kids that do exactly that.\n\n\nEdit: They have been progressivly pushing out solo players each update and I see no end in sight. I really wanted to play this game but i see that wish coming to an end. I spent 3 hours building a base today just to have 2 dudes rip it apart in less than 30 seconds. waste of time/waste of money at this point, until they add an insentive to not KOS or spawn camp fresh spawns stay as far away as possible.","February 20, 2015","false","345.9"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","25","36","0","0"

Those players already found everything when the population was low, and now they just go around with their assault rifles shooting everyone that has a rock and found some wood.

Unstable servers, unoptimized level designs that cause major client/server side lag, making it impossible for you and the server to ever be in sync, so good luck trying to kill that guy you just saw... by the time you get close enough and swing, he will lag in and out around that area and you will miss.\n\nAlso, despite the "massive map" size, the area with trees, resources, and people is limited to less than 20% of the map size, making the other 80% just barren mountains with nothing other then a demand of your time to treck up them.\n\nFinally, the developer is non other than Garry Newman, the creator of GMOD, which despite being a great game, Garry was very slow with updates, and any update he did release was unaccomdating to the servers and historical always broke all the custom servers made for garrys mod.

First and foremost, it is in beta, any complaints about lag, glitches and the like are just silly because that's the whole point of a game going through alpha/beta, otherwise it would just be called released.\n\nSecond and what should be more important: gameplay. The concept is basic but great, you wake up with nothing (realistically no stat pants couldn't hurt haha) and every piece of resource you need you have to gather. One issue on some servers is that resources aren't spawning quickly enough or at all from what I hear, but that's because the game is in alpha... aside from spawning rates resource execution is great, maybe in the future they will reskin some rocks to look like discarded metal for realism, but as far as gameplay goes it's all the same. In a real survival situation you wouldn't find piles of a variety of resources naturally, just some wood and minerals. Animals are scarce in some areas and that's completely realistic too, unless you're on a farm, if there was real life apocalypse you would not see bears and boars walking around main paths constantly.\n\nThe sleeping bag is a great feature. You can save a spawn point and use a metal door to hopefully keep your things safe. This allows you to actually form alliances and make friends, but doesn't add a "haven/neutral" point in the game which makes it so much more exciting.\n\nLastly community discussion. Yes, the people are mean and vicious, and perhaps they are kids (I like how that's become an insult these days, it's a videogame for Christ's sake!). This is what makes this game great. Who expects there to be tons of people out there willing to help others and extend trust and a welcoming hand to total strangers in an apocalypse? Most people you run into will be desperate and selfish, some well run the other direction because they are scared, lots will become bullies because they can and a few will begin to band together in these beginning stages of hard times. This is what I've come across so far playing the game, and this is what makes it pee your pants scary...what I assume you were looking for when you bought this game.\n\nFor anyone who wants a nice community with easy to gather resources and mobs that hit you for 3% of your health, play minecraft. For those who played for 30 mins or an hour and got tired of crap server lag and crashes, and glitchy gameplay just keep in mind it's in alpha and will get better. If you don't have the patience put it on the backburner for later enjoyment!","June 9, 2014","true","174.6"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","2"

Everytime you spawn into a world, everyone has already made a huge city around the spawn, making the world feel less like a huge expanse of land that needs to be explored and more like a city with an outer wall that you go an look at for some reason. You can find basic materials like wood and stone laid out on the ground, presumably the excess from the owner of the towering castle in front of you. And to top it all off, the game feels more like an fps with the end game being able to craft or find a gun and mess with other people. This is also apparent in the newly adapted Battle Royal mode, which it totes it borrowed from Arma 3 on every official server screen. The problem with it being an fps, is it's not even a good fps. Controls feel clunky in a fire fight and even worse when trying to fight someone in melee range. One time, I had a guy actually kill me at melee range and he didn't even make a swinging animation.\n\nThe game looks nice, but is poorly optimized. My rig is able to handle most games on high pretty fine, but chugs like a used car powered by soda when I try to get anywhere close to it. And I don't know if it's me, but it feels like there's this smeared-on white type filter over the screen. It makes everything seem brighter than it is and it's kind of annoying.\n\nI think the icing on this dirt cake is this game has been in alpha for about 2 years. They had revamped the game once, at one point calling it Rust Experimental. The move was nice, making the game look more refined and even changing the island. The game got a little better, but personally not enough. Now the devs are selling people's creations as store items. I'm not big fan of this from games who aren't even out yet. Especially when some of them get as pricey as $20. Fine as long as you want to support the devs, but it seems this game doens't have a release date in sight.\n\nThere are better survival games on Steam. There are better fps games on Steam as well. This game isn't quite steer clear. Many people like it, so there's a possiblility you might too. However, if you were to ask me, I cannot reccomend this game.","February 28","false","9.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","3"

Finding the right server and community to play with, being part of that community, getting friends, getting betrayed, and a lot more is included in this game.\n\nThe company developing this game, Facepunch, developer of Garry's Mod, keeps the game updated, and it contains loads of fun, especially if taking into consideration the fact that it's still in alpha-stage. Bugs and such do exist in the game, though usually they are minor, and the most major ones are fixed by the team in few weeks, even days.\n\nGetting started in Rust is going to be a long journey if you have no knowledge of the game. Gathering enough resources to craft your very first Stone Hatchet is a satisfying trip to learning more about the game, and what you might find when proceeding closer to the end-game gear. Got your base ready, set of Kevlar equipped, enough weaponry to beat anyone who comes at you? Go and blast a wall of another player. Grab all the loot you can. Get the hell out. Developed better tactics for... Whatever you might need. Raiding, building, surviving, trading, there are several things where you can develop.\n\nTl;dr, if you have any doubt if you should buy this or not, I recommend to do so.

All of us left to go to bed, the next day our place was ransacked. That annoyed me so I decided not to play. The next time, my friend was trapped inside his house by someone blocking the doors and walls with more layers.\n\nThe only reason we started playing again was because a friend of ours rented a server. Making the experience more enjoyable. As we were able to try to simply survive not get harassed while playing with other people killing us or ransacking or trapping us in our house.\n\nGameplay:\nWhen you get to playing - the 3D version of crafting, hunting, building is fun. Sometimes, there are issues with bugs - creatures going invisible, creatures standing up after killing them, Doors not opening, or unable to place platforms or building in an area. Past these bugs, the game can be fun.\n\nCommunity:\nThis is the turn-off. The big one for me that stopped me wanting to play until a friend chose to rent a server. If the server is not renewed, I do not think I would play unless there are some changes. Like house protection, trolls who trap you removed, but that is hard to control.\n\nIf you know the server and people you are playing with, I recommend. The concept and idea of the game I recommend and think could be great fun. However, if there is no longer a private server to play this on, I probably will not be going back to a public one.","March 16, 2014","true","18.2"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","24","36","0","1"

You basically start from scratch progressing and log on back next day and you can start from scratch again due to exploiters and hackers who raided your house. Community is teenage nerds who failing in their real life. No chance to socialize so chat is not even needed since it is always full of crap from total imbecils.\n\nExperimental: Developers are trying hard. Game is far from finished and really terrible at this stage. However, game have some potential, but this matter not since the community is even bigger garbage than on legacy. Naked morons killing each other for nothing. They wont get anything from you, just kill you. So typical example is 11 year kid chasing you for hours screaming hello, hi, hello. When you get tired of him and stop he will ofcourse kill you :).\n\nI'm huge fan of full loot FFA games, but this is beyon my understandings. There is no pvp atm, it and I would not even call it multiplayer since it is battle royale style game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bugs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ people, terrible gamplay and UI, no point of socializing, no point of doing anything you do.\n\nTitle is correct it is all about surviving where the best way is to own nothing, run naked and grief other players.\n\nMorons, nerds and raging teenagers who fail in their RL will definitelly enjoy this game. If you are non of previously mentioned just save your time and move along to another game.","December 30, 2013","false","352.1"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

I have a more than capable computer but the rendering is terrible and frame rate drops are awful even though I'm playing with a spotless internet connection.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with lots of atmosphere and a very strange dystopian feel. I really expect the final product to be something quite amazing but most of the satisfaction I get is balanced by boredom and frustration. Animals can run up sheer cliffs to escape or attack you,  the hit detection for weapons can be awful, hacking is abundant, and eveyone wants to kill you.\n\nNow, that last point is fine. It gives the game an edge, with every human encounter being excpetionally complex and dangerous. However I have never made an ally, and whenrver I don't kill somenone they stalk me and blow my brains out. I know it's a complex social experiment but when someone is never on your screen for more than a second because of lag or hacking, and you've spent 4 and a half hours getting all your equiptment together it gets frustrating. Most of my close range engagements with human beings end in failure because the game doesn't know where either of us should be. Long rang encounters end with me dead, as I've just spwaned in with a rock in my hands and someone has build a mile-high tower and just sits at the top sniping people with the bolt action and scope he just made.\n\nI want this game to work, and I could put up with the terrible animal behaviour, floating rocks, almost impossible to aquire upgrades, and all that other atmosphere destroying nonesense if it wasn't for the god-awful performance as a whole.\n\nBuy it when it's finished (in 10 years time) because right now it's not worth the money.","March 11","false","17.1"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","0"

I would definitely recommend giving it a try. Here are some things to ask yourself before you commit:\n\n+ Do you like the sound of an immersive, first-person, survival crafting game? If yes, good! Now ask yourself if you're going to be able to handle it when another player murders you, takes your stuff, and starts living in your house.\n\n+ Do you have friends with whom to play this game? If so, then Rust is a great choice. This is a game where both the triumphs are sweetened, and defeats softened considerably when shared with friends, from both a practical and a psychological standpoint. If you play Rust alone, the paranoia may cause you to go feral and never log off.\n\n+ Does the Man-versus-Nature theme appeal to you in any specific way? Stylistically, the focus on the fundamental needs of survival in nature is one of Rust’s most unique characteristics, so I’d give it a hardy recommendation for anyone with a proclivity for the outdoors. Conversely, if you hate going outside because you're afraid of being eaten by bears, this is a good chance to simulate the experience.\n\n+ Aside from friends, are you interested in dealing with other people? Rust is a pretty social game, and interaction beyond the usual scope of highly-structured, competitive gameplay is almost unavoidable. You will have some positive interactions, but you will also have some negative ones. I would not recommend it to the thin-skinned.\n\n+ Are you interested in trying out an “early-access” title? It’s hard to know what you’re getting into these days with unfinished games. However, I feel comfortable stating that Rust, for its part, is already at a pretty solid place in its development, and feels like a genuine effort to create something people will enjoy by letting them participate in the process.\n\nIf you like this review, check out the full article at:\nhttp://www.protagonistcomplex.com/rust-hell-is-other-people/\nOR\nJoin the PCPLX Steam Group!","February 12, 2014","true","241.7"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","1"

They've also removed the zombies and I'm pleased to say that I'm happy about both of these changes. With the banhammer swinging wild, the game is safer to play and enjoy. You're still gonna have all of your hard work ruined, but at least it won't be by some teleporting, C4 hurling god. The other change, hte removal of zombies, is also good, because hte game was never about them. Let's face it, they were never that big a threat. They were too weak and too few to be a threat. The game was more about surviving your needs and fellow man from the begining. With these changes implemented, I'm happy to change my review to a positive one and recommend this game again.\n\nUnless you really love working hard just to have everything blown up, don't bother with this game yet. Don't get me wrong, the game itself is great. For an alpha, it's really functional, with very few game breaking bugs. Exploring the wilderness feels dangerous and tense, and getting a group of friends together to build and defend a fort is awesome. But as it stands, server crashes, bad lag, and worst of all, hackers are completely ruining this otherwise great game. Valve Anti Cheat is used on every official server, but that seems to do nothing. People will still spawn in the best possible gear, teleport into your house, kill you and your friends, and then, for fun, blow up every last shread of your fort which took you days to build. I'm not concerned with the 'bandits', the players who are aggressive towards others, have a shoot-on-sight mentality, and will do anything to steal your gear. My issue comes from the vast ammount of hackers. In the future, if they can make hacking more difficult (I'm well aware that hacking can't be truely stopped), this game will be playable again, and it will be a lot of fun. But as it stands, you'll only be spending money on a tool to frustrate yourself.","December 31, 2013","true","30.2"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","29","46","0","0"

The game is fun, has some good crafting aspects.. Great for playing with friends.. But heres the problem.. The original rust, is dead.. So don't even bother playing.. The devs don't update it, and anyone who bought the original game back in the day basically got ripped off cause the new rust isnt optimized and has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fps. The new rust at least has a new anti-cheat system that stops hacking right? No... Hackers still exist, and you will run into them if you put in more than a few hours a day into a normal size sever at least once a week. But official servers are safe? Nope... Sorry. Ummm Official servers at least have active admins on the new rust tho? Nope.. I've seen people asking for admins for days.. Sure those servers get shut down, but how does that help the player who just wasted all their time and effort? Soo.. What am I buying?

There are countless bugs, which they don't seem to ever fix. I get 60-90 fps on other games consistently with high graphics settings, but I get about 20 fps with the lowest possible settings on this game. You have to play this game for at least 6 hours without stopping (not including the countless times that you'll be killed off spawn by people with guns already) if you want to get a decent base that won't get raided the second you get off. Even then, just give it a day and you'll be raided. You need a team to do practically anything. There's no real progression. After about 12 hours of playtime with a team, you've done all you can and you wait for the server reset that happens every week or so, depending on the server. The only real progression in the game is the fact that blueprints carry over after resets, so you can still build all of the overpowered equipment that makes people who started playing this game early on so unbeatable. This being early accesss is no excuse for it being an awful game, especially considering how long it's been early access for.","June 13, 2015","false","19.7"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","23","35","3","0"

I'm giving it a chance, I really am. There's just too many problems thanks to how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the community is. It's even worse than DayZ. Rust may have less people who are ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but the people who are take things to the next level.\n\nEssentially every server has a gang of 3/4 people. Sometimes they even go and have 20+ player gangs (CML) and they stockpile supplies and weapons. These people will have full kevlar and M4 rifles ready to go as they wander around shooting any and every single person they see. You just spawn naked with a rock? Here, have a bullet from my rifle.\n\nThis group will harass every person on the server, and if there's raiding? Oh boy, you better imagine they'll have 20 stacks of c4. Which still wouldn't be a problem except thanks to the sleeper system you're constantly in danger. So all these people have to do is spend all day getting airdrops (The only way to get C4) which isn't hard when a server has a limit to playercount for drops; then they wait till it's 5AM, log on, and blow all of your work up while giggling about how you essentially just designed a base and gathered all their new supplies for them.\n\nSo unless you have a group of people in different timezones constantly watching and on guard or if you have absolutely no life, you're going to wake up every day repeatedly with all of your stuff taken. So where does this leave you? Well, if you have no friends to play with then you're screwed. If you do have friends you better hope they aren't idiots like mine.\n\nOf course, just like DayZ there is zero incentive to not KoS, so this pretty much just makes an endless cycle of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I guess the game is fun if you get your kicks out of beating down new players over and over making sure they never get anything better than cloth and a makeshift pistol. And judging by the way the veteran players act, I guess it is fun.\n\nBasically the entire appeal of the game is to be a massive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Anyone who isn't an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is going to get killed by one over and over. And judging by the epeens of the community that's a big reason to play. Oh and bonus points for the fact that Garry is working on several games at once while selling this.","July 28, 2014","false","53.9"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","23","35","0","10"

In that time, they've upped the graphics and fixed a handful of bugs. Weapons and transportation have changed a lot, but no biggie. I've never enjoyed it much, but several of my friends have a few thousand hours in game. I mostly watch them- it's not my thing. The community is garbage, and it's fun for a time if you like the chaos. After a while though, everyone gets tired of being screamed at by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ children and having their base razed to the ground each night. When we play as a group, it's okay because we are agressors (kill or be killed). We trash others' hard work and ♥♥♥♥ on their fun. None of us play solo because there's no fun to be had. I'm not looking for a great community -I have over 2000 hours in DOTA 2 ffs, it's almost all garbage- but this one is generally far worse than any community I've ever encountered. The forced, unchangeable character model is ♥♥♥♥ as well. Many people who've recieved female models are leaving the game because a) they don'r identify with their character and b) the community is far worse on female models than male ones. I've read a lot of reviews about how they got a female body and were chased around with kids screaming "♥♥♥♥ the ♥♥♥♥♥" until they DC'd. Sounds about right. That's what Rust promotes.

At first I didn't like the game simply because I was joining the wrong servers and was getting killed by other players before I could even get my first item.  Then I found a great server with helpful people and a good atmosphere,  I had finally created my first house and was well on my way to producing my first weapon.  Then things went downhill.  I had spent 5 hours playing on this good server and was in need of a quick break.  I logged off for about 30 minutes and when I logged back in I had found that all my items were gone.  This had not happened the last two times I logged off this server.  Turns out that the doors on houses are glitchy and will randomly delete themselves.

This game is a wash.\n\nThere are so many reasons I can list to not buy this game.  Lets start with the hacks. It's the most hacked game I have ever played on Steam.  Noclip hacks, Duping hacks, Suicide hacks, and those are the hacks you'll see with in the first hour of playing on an "Official" server.  There has been a suicide hack out for the last 4 or 5 days and the Dev's have done nothing, thereby making the game unplayable.  I can not fathom why they do not even have one admin on the official servers.  They've made enough money to pay someone to admin the official servers at least.\n\nAnother reason to stay away from this game is the Developer.  It looks like they are more interested in making a micro economy then fixing the hacker problem.  I don't trust a Dev that sells me a game with more hacks in it then you can count then goes to Steam Dev days and sleeps thru the VAC talk.  http://garry.tv/2014/01/19/steam-dev-days-day-2/  He missed the two things most important to his game, VAC and the engine the game runs on.  The first thing posts about is trading and getting Rust stuff into the steam marketplace.  How about getting us a playable game first?\n\nMy advice on Rust is to wait.  Maybe the Dev will realize that making the game actually work takes priority over trivial stuff like tf2 hats and dreams of future windfalls from microtransactions.\n","January 19, 2014","false","512.6"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","30","48","0","3"

YES\nthis game is fun and intersting for 2 month after that is pointless!!! i gathered a lot of woods and other resources in 2 month and lost them in 2 days!! you cant even trust your friends, some of them are trustable,many of them are not!! they can easily stab u in back and loot your valuable stuff,u easily lost your stuff in this game even if they are in safe place. servers are full of hackers!!\nThe game is as alpha as it gets; so I'm giving it some credit for the massive potential its concept has. But the execution so far has been poor...and the "community". The people who play this game? Foul, antisocial adolescents.\n\n\nUnfortunately Valve/Steam released the Alpha at 20$ a copy, well before the game was playable. Between the constant server downtime, massive lag spikes, and hackers galore, I'm not sure who is enjoying their experience with Rust, Especially since you can't save your game. Nothing more frustrating than losing everything to a rad wolfes and bears and even looters...\n\n\nHACKERS and CHEATERS will ruin your game, there is no doubt about that. this is an alpha, so we shouldn't expect too much as far as appearances, gameplay, etc. HOWEVER, it would be nice if it were actually possible to find resources (e.g., minerals or rocks) in the vicinity of all of the damned rocky hills in the area. I'm running around for a half hour just to find some rocks so I can make a hatchet, and there are none to be found, even though the scenery looks like what the glaciers left behind when they retreated. The game clearly needs a lot of work,Stay as far away from this game as possible!!!  Everyone will probably shoot you on sight without any reason and even if you are a newbie and still learning the game.\n\n\nThis is early alpha stage and is full of bugs and glitches and then the developers decided to make it even easier and they removed only enemy type that was dangerous and that is ZOMBIES. There is no enjoyment getting killed over and over again. You have no protection anywhere and you can be killed and looted even when you leave the server, which is outright annoying and idiotic.\nToo many people are giving in 10/10 within the first 10 minutes of playing thinking it is the best survival game ever created but its not. DayZ may have a catalogue of woes itself but it is probably the best in the genre at this stage. Rust is not unique in any way; it's just a first-person survival game with glaring technical and concept issues that are years from rectifying.\n\n\nObviously, this game is so bad that it make me laugh, but only for a few seconds. The combat is ridiculous bad and there's nothing good about this mess. Stay away from this garbage and please try real FPS games. and atleast i must say i waste lot of time in this game and gathering many stuff, but when i woke up at morning none of them were there... dont waste ur money on this game guys, you can buy better survival games!!","September 21, 2014","false","53.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","8"

After 70 hours of gameplay *cough* in roughly a week and a half.. I can honestly say this game is super fun. Yes this is still in the alpha phase so there are some bugs. But do you want a game that is so versatile that you can do what you want when you want? This is for you... Don't want to deal with people killing you? Fine just go in a non pvp server.. Want to get put on a beach somewhere, naked with nothing but a rock surrounded by people who know what there doing, fighting your way through the elements? Well they got servers for you. I have never had this much fun exploring the different ways to progress. I admit that I am a little bit of a glutton for being put in impossible odds situations, so some of rusts servers have definitely provided that.\n\nAnyway enough of my rambling.

This was a great game intill the big changes.\nIm going to list a few reasons why Legacy was such a better game\n\n-Graphics were simple and had a nice feel to the game\n-You could actually run the ♥♥♥♥er, the new rust is for Beast CP's now Medium range Computers cannot stay within the 50-60 Fps range now (My R9 380 cant top 58 on Medium settings, and when i farm it goes down to 30, In legacy i could easily get 100-130 fps)\n-It had a nice Survival feel to it unlike the new rust, it had a sense of "Wow, im actually going to need to survive here"\n-You didnt have to worry about getting guns or weapons all the time since your main concern was to hide from animals and zombies\n- The community wasnt cancer back then, you could easily ask someone if they wanted to survive with you instead of getting KoS from just about anyone ingame\n-There was KoS in legacy, and it wasnt rare but people seemed more pleasent to be around.\n-The Building was not as good, but it gave you more realistic buildings, since you know your here to survive not become a realistate desighner\n-Gun play seemed arcadey wich isnt the best way to describe it but it was fun, entertaining and didnt feel to much like a FPS\n-Guns felt more like a tool then a weapon (sounds weird i know) But you used them most of the time to hunt animals or defend yourself from zombies rather then something you only use on other players\n-Raiding was intense, you actually had to plan your attack, for example you had to look between the gaps in the walls to see were the stash was and then plant the bomb. Now its just a bunch of rockets and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t\n-The Map was something else (there was only 1) It had bunch of eras wich had different feels to them each and you had to plan were you wanted to set up camp since those spots all had unique things going for them\n-I personaly hate random generated maps, especially when most of the time it makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense at all, i mean a random "Rad town" in the middle of a snowy feild and right next to it is a huge globe that looks like a Wonderball i mean what? Atleaste legacy has a road and towns and such that made sense\n","March 29","false","462.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","2"

Trust no one except the real life friends you bring with you. People will infiltrate your groups just for the chance at getting your stash. In gun battles always watch your back because a sneaky sniper can turn a charge forward into the dreaded "zip" that we all hate. Lastly, build big with as many doors as you can.  The bigger you are the harder  it'll be to raid you. All in all, if you haven't bought this game yet you're missing out on something truely breathtaking.\n\nEdited Review! 7/17/2015\n\nMy friends and I have been playing the NEW Rust for my YouTube channel and it turned out to be a pretty good series for the channel. There are a lot of things you can do with Rust when it comes to YouTube and it's one thing we're looking forward to, but for now we're enjoying raiding and the stupidity of trying to raid with spears! Check out the playlist below for the videos I've posted so far!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw6d9Sst6yfDO105pGhj-iL2veDqLSZIv","February 19, 2014","true","682.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

There's almost nothing else to do other than stare at rocks and trees for hours on end just to have your progress destroyed 2-3 days after the server wipe. At this point, I can only recommend the game to people who are in groups. The reasoning is, because if you play solo, the chances of you being able to raid and defend yourself are slim to none once the bigger groups keep taking everything you have - leaving a huge gap between you and them. Other than raiding, there's really nothing to keep players occupied (Raiding is the single point of this game it seems). There's more ways to break into a base than to defend it. The defences are extremely weak for the short time it takes to get the resources needed to attack. Most of the Rust community is full of cancer and trolls. and the likelyhood of you finding someone that's actually friendly is almost slim to none. Although it can be fun at first, enjoy loosing everything all the time. People will attack you for no reason, and likely tease you as you're downed before helping you up and killing you instantly.\n\nTL;DR - Game is full of trolls. Nearly everybody is KoS. Hours of gathering for seconds of weak defences against overpowered raiding tools. This game is essentially basic math in the sense of raiding and how long you'll bother to bare with the emptiness. All in all, don't buy this game until it's out of EA (Early Access).\n\nI'll update this review when there's more to do in the game and defences are less pathetic against the raiding tools\n\nP.S. Rockets shouldn't be in the game.","May 21","false","842.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

That seems to be the comparison thrown around the webs. I would maybe recommend DayZ, but I can't recommend RUST and I'll give you quick rundown on the things that bugged me the most.\n\nThe server list. Joining a server on DayZ is very simplified. You can filter, refresh, select a desired server and then click 'connect'. Not so simple in RUST.\n\nIn RUST, the server list populates and shuffles around based on the filter, and to connect to a server, you have to double click that server. Doesn't sound bad does it? Well, imagine trying to double click that server name while its being shuffled up and down your screen, flickering in and out, at the speed of blink. I've never once joined a server I wanted to, because there is no way to stop the list from populating, so when you click on a server, by the time you get the second click off, that server could be 2 pages back. NOT A JOKE. In DayZ, when you click a server, that server stays on screen, everything is simplified. Also, when you join a different server on RUST, ALL OF YOUR STUFF IS GONE. You start over on that server. On DayZ, all your possesions cross servers. In some rare cases where a private server is using a different(older) build, then yes, maybe.\n\nBoth games are in Alpha. Which is more Alpha? RUST. DayZ is missing a few core elements, but Rust is missing a lot more substance, which being a game centered on crafting, is huge. Although what stood out more than that was the quality. I started the game at night and the sky is horrible. I questioned the graphics after seeing tons of screens and videos, but after playing I can tell you that the graphics are pretty bad. The sky is obviously boxed. The stars are square pixels and the moon had no effects, just halo within halo of slightly darker color. The wildlife and zombies also look horrible. Guess whats worse? The sound quality. The sound quality in this game is really bad. I was chased by a wolf to some rocks that it couldn't climb on and so its bark just looped. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bark. It was hilarious and I laughed. And its everything too. The sound of you banging your starting rock on trees to gather wood will give you a headache.\n\nRust seems to really be centered around crafting or building everything from your weapons, clothes, food, and shelter. All of which you need to survive, but this is the main sell and is the only reason I can give to get this game. If you like gathering resources(which are scarce) and building a shelter, home, or whatever and protecting that, then you will like this game. It is a very unforgiving survival game, yes, but that all revolves around your crafting first and foremost.\n\nThe community is what everyone complains about on RUST and DayZ. No one likes to die or have their posessions stolen. Despite all the complaints, I've been fortunate to have come across decent players on both games. But which is worse? I'll tell you which community is more annoying. RUST. There is a global chat in rust(text only) that gets spammed by crybabies constantly. No such thing in DayZ. Mostly its people accusing other people of hacking. On that note, I've personally seen players running at 20X normal speed through fields and other players suiciding in their presence. RUST has no official servers so you will be at the mercy of hackers and admins. I have never seen or heard of a hacker yet in DayZ, but every single game of RUST I've seen accusations thrown in global chat or witnessed myself.\n\nI did have fun with RUST. My first encounter involves a man peeking through a square hole in a house that I found and occupied. He said," Hello there, my boy! I see you have a nice fire there!" We had a pleasant conversation, after which hilarity ensued, a chase, and then a mortal contest. I nearly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself from laughter. However, I can't recommend this game because so much of it is bad and/or unfinished. My thoughts might change a year or so from now, but pesonally, I recommend you take that 20 bill and spend it on a better game or beer.","January 15, 2014","false","20.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

But I recommend to play this game with your friends just to have some crazy stuff happen. The game is growing every week a new update, and you notice the changes every week. Dont doubt to get this game cause its Early Access, its a finished game with every week updates. This game is Multiplayer so you need a decent Internet connection to play this.\nThere are 2 kinds of servers: Vanilla servers (for the hardcore players) or Modded Servers (for the people that want to be rich) I usually play at the Modded servers because Vanilla servers are really difficult. Believe its really difficult, dont even think that if you're from Minecraft and play this game that it will be easy to master Vanilla, Its really hard to get stuff and you need patience cause if you craft stuff it can even take 10 minutes to craft stuff. That was the problem that I had with Vanilla so then I switched to modded.\n\nMelee Weapons:\nRock\nTorch\nStone Hatchet\nHatchet\nStone Pick Axe\nPickaxe\nSalvaged Ice Pick\nSalvaged Axe\nWooden Spear\nStone Spear\nBone Knife\nBone Club\nSalvaged Hammer\nMachete\nSalvaged Sword\nMace\nSalvaged Cleaver\nLongsword\n\nRanged Weapons:\nHunting Bow\nF1 Grenade\nBeancan Grenade\nSurvey Charge\nCrossbow\nRocket Launcher\nEoka Pistol\nRevolver\nSemi-Automatic Pistol\nSemi-Automatic Rifle\nWaterpipe Shotgun\nPump Shotgun\nAssault Rifle\nThompson\nCustom SMG\nBolt Action Rifle\nTimed Explosive Charge (C4)\nM249\n\nHandguns:\nEoka Pistol\nRevolver\nSemi-Automatic Pistol\n\nShotguns:\nWaterpipe Shotgun\nPump Shotgun\n\nSub-Machine guns:\nThompson\nCustom SMG\n\nRifles:\nAssault Rifle\nBolt Action Rifle\nM249\nSemi-Automatic Rifle\n\nExplosives:\nTimed Explosive Charge\nRocket Launcher\nF1 Grenade\nBean Can Grenade\nSurvey Charge\n\nWeapon mods:\n4x Zoom Scope\nSilencer\nHolosight\nWeapon Flashlight\nWeapon Lasersight\n\nOther:\nHunting Bow\nCrossbow\nAuto Turret\n\n(Sorry for putting all the weapons in this review, I'm sure that there are soem people that want to know that.

Yes, female characters were needed.  Multiple races were needed.  Players should, however, be able to freely choose.  I know it's not very original, but being able to customize your avatar as you see fit is important in a game like this.  Whether you want the character to look like you or not is irrelevent.  The point is Facepunch is forcing its players (i.e. its backers, since it's still early access) to play a character not of their choosing and one they may not necessarily like.\n\nI expect there to always be men who play female characters and women who play men, but if it's their choice, then I'm all for it.  But voice-chat will ruin any immersion.  I've heard the argument "so does a kid's voice coming out of a man's body."  Well, seems interesting considering this game is rated for adults only, and if not then why are no children character models in Rust for them to play?\n\nThat being said, it's a game.  It's supposed to be fun.  Remove enough of the choices that tend to make a game more attractive and pretty soon people will make the choice to not play anymore.\n\nHad a lot of fun while it lasted.

Wrong.\n\nRust has been in development for more than one year now and apart from the graphics, nothing has changed.\nSure the game may look fancy in most occasions, but you won't get to enjoy that anyway.\nThe game gets frustrating really fast if you're playing alone.

Playing alone is a rather tedious task, especially on servers where you can't set a home and have to start over every time you get killed.\n\nOn top of that, the performance is terrible. Especially in the new version, where they removed the option to disable the grass - which is by far the biggest FPS killer in the game.\n\nTL;DR: Buy this game if you want to play with friends.

"Food please. Give me Food Please" is what he as he stared me down with his Bow. I thought to myself - "is this a stick up?".. so I closed my door. Waited 2 mins opened my door .. An Arrow whizzed past my head. I quickly shut the door. I waited another 3 mins and ran out the door, my bow equipped. That is when I seen the other 3 guys. All of them armed with Bows. I lasted about 10 seconds.\n\nSpawned again - no idea where my shelter was. Spent another hour gathering until I finally gave up on my orignal shack and started building a fortress. Found a real nice place on the top of a really high hill. Figured easier to defend and can see bandits coming. Problem was - animals and resources were very scarce. Eventually gave up and exited server (after 4-5 hrs total)\n\nServer 2. Tons of players, tons of resources, tons of zombies. Lots of structures and people seemed generally nice. Punched another 4 hours gathering and building. Locked my doors and logged out for the night. -- Next morning I logged back in to find the door to my building blown off and all my stuff gone. Essentially meaning - 4 hours the day before was for nothing.\nAfter speaking to people currently on the server they came off to me as a bundle off @ssclowns.  Decided best to leave.\n\nServer 3. A small amount of friendly people. Lots of Zombies and lots of resources. So far so good. I found myself a nice little spot up in the hills over looking the zombie camps and resources. Hoping this might work out better.  After making a little shelter and some improvements I locked my door once more and logged out. Hoping this time when I log back in everything will be as I left it.\n\nAt its current stage (alpha) I find it hard to recommend. Im having some fun but its a little stressful playing for hours and thinking "If I log out, when I come back my progress may be all gone" ...\n\nWill update this as game gets updated as well.\n\nUPDATE 1: (Feb 1st, 23 hours played)\n\nI'm changing my recommend to a Yes. Reason being.. obviously Ive been playing the game more. Server 3 I mentioned above has been more fun. Most of the people are nice and no admin abuse. Have myself a nice little place started and have learned alot.\n\nJoined a fourth server. One with a whole town of good people. The only rule is, if you kill within the town (and boundary) , there's a bounty on your head. So there is a safe haven while building within its gates. All bets are off though once you leave the town and hunt/gather etc. Very fun and much more balanced then previous servers. Only problem with this setup however is there is sometimes alot of lag in the town. Game isn't really meant to have that many structures in the one place.\n\nThis game is not however recommended for people that drop things quick. Its too easy to have my experience I listed above and uninstall forever. With as many games as I do and as little time, the acceptance with RUST "Nothing lasts forever .. or even between logins" is a MUST.\n\nAnd clearly you have to watch out for @ssholes. If you don't believe me? Check out some of the comments so far on this review alone. :D\n\nUPDATE 2: (Feb 1st - 2 hrs later)\nAnyways I think Im done with Rust (for now) ... After building a nice little house in a very friendly server.. went offline for sleep.. 8 hrs later.. log back in.. spend 1 hr trying to find my house.. find it.. Only to find out.. someone built stairs up the side of it (bypassing my locked door).. went into the window and stole everything... AGAIN.. Yes its apart of the game.. But.. I dont have the time to waste playing a game only to be shutdown (while Im real life sleeping) ..\n\nFinal Thoughts ..\nYou ever play a game for 8 hours straight .. Save it. Go to bed and turn on the game the next day only to find your Save game is corrupt or lost? That is the feeling I get from playing this game. Alas Im done for now - until they add Traps or AI or something to guard your things between game sessions.","January 26, 2014","false","35.0"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","22","35","0","9"

I'll get into the game itself first.\n\nSo I never played old Rust, but from what I saw of the old Rust compared to the new version this is much better. The crafting is time consuming at times but not unfair, it's optimized better than the other survival games I've tried (dayz and h1z1 pale in comparison to this game in my opinion) so I can actually run this game around high settings even though I only have a 750ti. Without overclocking I do have a drop every now and then however so I do put them a bit lower than high when I'm not overclocking it. The weapons are pretty cool, and the building system is actually really good, and while there are a few small things that bother me, the only really annoying thing is how the animals act. You'll be chasing a deer ready to shoot an arrow at it and all the sudden it'll fly 20ft. up a rock instead of running around it, bears will randomly attack sometimes and wolfs don't act like wolfs at all. Instead of traveling in packs, you'll just see one random wolf running in circles (all the animals run in circles just about unless it's running away from someone or chasing someone) and it'll do a heck of a lot of damage. I feel like they should do less damage and be in a pack instead of the way they currently are.\n\nI haven't gotten to exploring the entire map on the server I play on but that's mainly because the majority of people do freak out and shoot you even if you're a fresh spawn, however some will be nice and after looting to see you are a fresh spawn they'll pick you up, sometimes even give you an axe or other resources to give you a small headstart into surviving. But...BUT...you can NOT get off this game almost ever, not in just the fact the game's addicting (it really is) but because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who raid you while you're offline because they're too scared to fight anyone in a legit fight. I stayed up all night making sure I'd be A-Okay with some buddies, and got off for about 3-4 hours before going to watch Deadpool because I had to see that before someone spoiled it for me. After getting back, only taking about 6 hours off the game which is basically the amount of sleep the avg person might get in, the base had already been raided, all the beds/bags were destroyed, and there was an autistic sign with a pony on it showing me that it was ♥♥♥♥ing bronies that did it. Of all the cancerous people that decided to be wimps and raid offline people, it would have to be bronies.\n\nI get that getting raided is part of the game by the way, I'm not complaining like "wah I got killed in a game about killing and surviving I'm gonna ♥♥♥♥♥ about it online now", that's how it works. But when you can't keep everything unless you spend every waking moment on the game, it really makes you mad and just not want to try anymore, and the annoying part is there's no point in rebuilding because the server wipe is only in a few days so it'd be a waste of time.\n\nI'd still recommend buying this game despite this if you want a good survival game, because it's the best out of them and you can have a ton of fun on it when you're not getting screwed over. Just remember that you will be attacked a lot, especially if you build your base poorly.\n\nNow if you excuse me, I have a base to cry over.","February 14","true","156.4"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/carbeano/recommended/252490/","carbeano","MORSOV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/carbeano/","62 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is my actual, serious review of Rust, after playing the game for upwards of 30 hours.\n\nDon't get this game if you're expecting a multiplayer survival experience. It's not remotely close to that. The environment in  Rust poses a very minimal threat; maybe a slight inconvenience, if you happen to just have spawned. Freezing to death can be circumverted by crafting yourself the most basic set of clothes, and heat appears to be broken, because I lived in a desert for the entirety of my stay in a server. ran around in polar gear, and could not observe a negative in my character's ability to perform. There are two hostile animals, both of which are formidable if you run straight at them and try to mulch them with a torch. Otherwise, they can be easily dispatched through the use of the wooden spear, which can take a whopping thirty seconds to a minute to obtain. House building is the most interesting feature on this game, as it's quite flexible and can really lend itself to impressive structures- that will be blown into and pillaged, their inhabitants massacred, in less than a day. No, if you actually want your base to last, you have to build a bunker, which isn't very artistic or creative, but it's the only thing that will let you survive long enough to get a gun, which, by the way, can be found in the literally hundred barrels that are scattered around the map. But the shoddy little SMG you found (and will loose shortly) isn't very impressive when there's people running around with full body armour and automatic rifles, is it?\n\nThe problem with Rust in its current state (it's in alpha, or beta, or some kind of letter from the Greek alphabet, so I expect some things will change) is that there's no depth to it. Your gameplay roadmap will invariably look like this:\n\n1. Join a server for the first time.\n2. Spend an hour or two (possibly more, depending on how populated your server of choice is) collecting resources, in which you might be killed by a bored player looking for something to do.\n3. Build or find a place to live in.\n4. Spend more hours improving your place to make it player-proof, or at least, bored-player-with-C4-looking-for-something-to blow-up-proof.\n5. Try to find more advanced equipment to protect yourself against bored players.\n6. Either a) Eventually loose your ♥♥♥♥ when players catch wind that you might become a threat and hunt you down b) Somehow come out on top.\n7. Become a bored player that is looking for something to do.\n\nLiterally everything- EVERYTHING- in this game is aimed towards PVP. You can build machines that help you mine resources faster, sure- to get  metal (for guns), or fuel (to make explosives). That in and of itself isn't bad; DayZ and Unturned are similar games that are very PvP-oriented. The problem with Rust is that getting to the level where you can actually PvP takes hours, or even days. Thus, when killing a player, or raiding a base, you are destroying a HUGE amount of effort and time. And since you also put in a lot of time to be where you are, you do it so your own work is not destroyed. There's rarely any human interaction; only kill or be killed. And once you're at the top, staying there is relatively easy; have clan or group to play with, wipe out forests and mineral fields, make a multi-layer base out of solid metal. Ammo becomes spare change; why not shoot that guy with the bow and arrow, who can't put a dent in you? Three or four shots kill him and the four hours he spent scrounging for wood to build a house, and if by some freak accident he does manage to kill you, you can instantly respawn, get one of your fifty replacement sets of equipment, and try again.\n\nThe game definitely has potential. It's very visually appealing; it has an amazing dev team who put out updates with amazing regularity. Making killing someone actually mean something to you (or nothing), by making ammo and weaponry more scarce- or, on the other side of the coin, dramatically increasing the rate at which you can find equipment to even out the playing field and make it a casual post-apocalyptic FPS with a huge map and certain survival elements- would make the game a lot more enjoyable. For the moment, though, I wouldn't recommend it. It's a time sink that will net you nothing of value (there's practically no learnable skills except game knowledge and shooting a slow moving target) except the ocasional cool human interaction, which you can easily get from a different game in the same genre.","September 30, 2015","false","60.4"," 39 of 67 people (58%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","58","39","67","8","1"

The game is totally different and seems like a lot more fun, it had seemed like the devs had made the game a lot better in a lot of ways. I then noticed that my character was female, which took away from my immersion, so I got off the server to try and change my character. It took me about five minutes of looking through all the options in Rust before I looked it up and found out that character appearance was determined by your Steam ID and was permanent. Maybe some people don't mind this or even think it is cool, but for me it ruins the immersion and makes the game pointless to play for me. Makes me wish I had never bought this game, if you are looking for a game where the devs seem to be doing everything pretty well, look into Ark: Survival Evolved. It is about the same price and is far more fun in my opinion.","April 12","false","88.1"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","0"

Seriously worth getting. I always try to justify games by the hours played, unless the story is just THAT amazing, however this game has no story, at least not yet, and I have 200+ hours on it.

Rust has many addictive features it nearly ticks all the box for gameplay, fun, interaction, base building and a feeling of achievement when you work for something. The one and only issue which is a big one is the serious amount of hacking and cheating that goes on during gameplay not only should someone be band for hacking but there Ip Address aswell. Aim Boting, flying, Teleporting, Opening your coded doors without knowing the codes, Glitching through barred up windows and walking through your base... These problems are endless and is not being taken care of quickly and properly enough, You can spend days and hours building your base for it to be taken by hackers which nearly beats the purpose and the time you've put into the game to begin with. If you get raided by non hackers then no problem thats part of the game and part of what makes Rust good not knowing if you got raided while your offline by non cheaters. All in all I have uninstalled the game with no intention of playing again until the hacking has completely stopped and I think the game is going to lose alot of Players that won't return back because the interest has been destroyed by the degenerate people that feel the need to cheat in a GAME.... Great game, Great concept, Slowly but surely being ruined. For now I would not recommend this game for the sole reason of hackers your wasting your own time putting effort into something that you can't do anything about to defend.","September 9, 2015","false","293.2"," 42 of 73 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","42","73","3","5"

Rust has it ups and downs. You can make friends or foes, you can battle with your friends against your foes, control whole areas, build allies around you, and dominate the land. For me Rust is a game that isn't going to get old soon. The various multiplayer servers allow you to choose what you want. You can choose a higher gather rate if you want a fast pace PvP and base building experience. Or you could play on one of the official servers if you are more on the "Wanna-Be Survivalist" side of the experience.\n\nOverall:\n~8/10~\nSorry, didn't go way into depth for this review bc its 1am and I should be asleep lol","June 21, 2015","true","165.0"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","17","26","6","0"

Out of the clear blue sky, I saw hell itself descend from the mountain tops; dressed in black, like a tar bath that took the lives of a many dinosaurs. The only thing I could do was press down on the microphone key, screech as loud as I could, and run my defined, muscular gluteus maximus back to my cozy little beachfront property.\n\nSo close to death, yet, I couldn't give up my abundance of chicken and charcoal - the blackness almost took my naked soul when out of nowhere, the naked armada came riding in like some kind of Lord of the Rings move. Naked rockmen, naked bowmen, even naked men with modern firearms! They swarmed the blackness with the force of a dozen savage natives; of course, the majority of them didn't win; their necks stretched out like piece of chewed bubblegum past its flavor prime. One bowmen took the mantel, though - his brave, white aryan features, and marksmenship expertise; he took the shot, and the darkness was no more - only his intolerable cries would be heard over chat. As I ran up to thank my savior, he turned to me for a moment, and for that time, I thought I had met my true love - then, he drew another arrow and drove an arrow right through my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-I-N-G skull.\n\n10/6, don't trust black savages disguised as white men, always lift to keep the body you deserve, and always flee from conflict.\n\n: - )","June 22, 2014","true","184.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","10","13","4","2"

It is one of the most addicting games I have ever played, spent 9 hours straight playing. Only downside is it was impossible to find rocks but majority of the community is extremely friendly and are always helpful or want to make a town with you and then you end up starting a mini-town. I definitely would recommend this game to anyone who loves survival type games or just wants to try out a new game.

I build a shelter and then I died. I died a few more times and then I disconnected. Maybe I should "git gud" and "lern to play". I could play with friends and share resources with a clan. Killing bambis because thats what you do in multiplayer games (its funny).\n\nWhy can't people join factions and have protected faction areas like in minecraft? I want to be able to set an arbitrary home somewhere and go hide there when I'm scared. Maybe I should play minecraft or something.\n\nAt least in minecraft you could run 50,000 blocks out in some random direction, dig to bedrock, build a farm, eat carrots for life and not have to worry about your base RANDOMLY GETTING DESTROYED BECAUSE THE SERVER JUST FELT LIKE IT. Apparently if you don't play for a while, ur base gets raided by itself and rip goes ur stuff.\n\nThat kind of feeling you get in minecraft that your base is safe and you can mess around in there is gone completely. Everything feels like a deathmatch with huts. When I say "huts", I really mean massive sky scrapers made out of giant logs. Which will also evaporate if you stop using them.\n\nI kinda like it. You never feel safe, until you are. Then you arn't because the hacker connected and hes yolo hopping into ur base liek a bird on a trampoline.\n\nIts a game that isn't going anywhere. The devs will work on it until they are satisfied. Thats what I believe after seeing how the game has changed over time. The game changes more than most early access titles. I look forward to seeing the community grow and I'm curious for the future of the game.","June 4, 2015","true","41.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","11","15","5","5"

The game is also very laggy, in more than one respect. The servers obviously, but the menus also freeze for a not so insignificant amount of time when navigating and choosing options.

Awesome!".\n\nThey removed the zombies.\n\nIt's really a survival sand box... and when I say sand box, I mean it's filled with children who want to kick over your sand castle you just built, because nobody likes them in real life and they need to take their aggression out. Every time the devs 'fix' something, 10 things break. Servers constantly wipe and game play has gotten to the point to where you can't play... at all.\n\nThere is no reason why you should waste any money on this game.\n\nI would like to extend my gratitude towards FacePunch studios for one thing, though. I would like to thank them for opening my eyes into the 'beta' world. Whoever thought of the concept of opening beta games up to public use and 'gather real players opinions' on game play should be shot in the face.\n\nFacepunch Studios: Fininsh your ****ing game, and stop listening to the public.","January 25, 2015","false","401.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

You need to find food, avoid rads, craft weapons, clothes, doors, walls, basically everything. You begin with no more than a rock,a torch,and a medkit.From that, you will have to store wood, rocks,craft everything you need for survival.You can become allied with other players and share a home or fight; you can find blueprints to research new technologies. Everything seems perfect.\nUNTIL...\nWell,imagine you passed two days of your life gathering resources and building your home, and some raiders with C4 blast your wall and steal everything. You could say"well, it's a realistic game, this could happen in real life".Yeah,right; you are perfectly right.But try to imagine: 20 hours, 20 effective hours of gameplay wandering and collecting resources, getting killed, doing it over and over again until an ***hole armed with C4 makes this whole thing finish within a second. No coming back, no saves. YOU ARE DEAD. And you will find yourself with a rock,a torch and a medkit.Again.And again.And again. And do not think it was bad luck to find some raiders: you will be killed several times during that 20 hours from various people and obviously lose all of the stuff you were collecting.Oh fun fact, these people are armed with 9mm, M4, grenades, and you will will confront with them with a rock, or at the best a stone hatchet.This could be enough...if you are a Jedi.\nDo you think it ends here?NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!\nIn facts, Valve anti-cheat engine works as good as a french fries-powered plane,and you cannot imagine how many cheaters are out there.People flying, people running at 80 miles per hour, people with 40 C4. And they will regularly kill you without reason, just "'cause it's fun".  Additionally, people who bought this game some time ago had the opportunity to have a desert world to prepare for. And you, the last arrived, find yourself with a rock fighting again laser pistols.Not counting all the cocky 12 yo kids,thinking they are in CoD, which will constanly talk about their plan to conquer the world and kill your mama blalbblabla, doing everything to interfere with your work.And trust me, there's NO diplomacy on this game.The story should be that the island is an asylum, because people are all crazy.The acronym you will read most in this game will be KOS:"KILL ON SIGHT"\nCONCLUSIONS\nI bought this game because I was a huge fallout fan, and I had great expectations; and I have to admit that my expectations were met. I am terribly sorry for this negative review, because the idea is very good and the game itself is very good,and I understand all the work behind this.But the game is just unplayable.there is too much cheating and there is too much imbalance. It is not possible to have to begin from nothing every time a super-human player or more often a damn cheater destroys your house and steals the result of days of storing.It's a game, not an agony.I do really hope that in the beta they will find a way to give players the opportunity to survive more than 5 minutes.\nWhat to say?Buy it?ABSOLUTELY NOT,  if  things  keep staying like this, but if you hope like me that all this will be balanced form alpha to beta version, buy it because it has a great potential","March 13, 2014","false","55.0"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","21","34","0","9"

It's just a complete wast of time to gather the necessary materials to build a base only to have 3 or 4 players slaughter you, take everything and destroy your base.

Initially starting out naked with just a rock and a torch you are in quite a vulnerable state. So you gather wood and stone to build a hatchet and a pick. You then start building more and more until finally you are reasonable comfort. Or so you thought! Bears and Wolves are gonna eat you, but if you kill them then the reward is sweet. The idea of having neighbours who you are weary of but you are willing to chat and maybe help out sounds fun.\n\nThen reality hits you. This games community is hell, they will kill on sight and even if you are naked and shout "Friendly" they will still waste ammunition on you (which can be expensive) because they can. Your character will always remain online and thus you at the mercy of people who will break down your base easily and kill you in your sleep. No one wants to help anyone and assume automatically you are going to kill them so they kill you, even if you have your back to them.\n\nNow as I said, this is a good game. But eventually getting people who have basically reached the end game killing fresh spawns over and over gets tiring.\n\n7.5/10 Gameplay\n1/10 on Community (9/10 times they'll kill you)\n3/10 overall score.\n\nPlease bring friends along, you can achieve more in groups of 5+ than anything less.

That means gameplay is subject to change and anything you might see in the game now could be gone in a few weeks.\n\nI came into this game not knowing anything about it, just a buddy that told me to try it out.  I did, and I'm having a blast.\n\nI was trying to write the Pro's and Con's to the game, but when I think about it, every part of the game can be thrown in both.\n\nThe community, which can be an absolute nightmare, is very rewarding once you find people you trust.  Now keep in mind, I've already had this community coming into the game.  I can imagine it is even more rewarding if you find people you can actually trust.  The people in this game write the story for you.  This is what people complain about, but define your gameplay experience.  You are surviving, and the people are your number one threat.  Keep your distance if alone, and get a damn place to put your stuff ASAP.  I would suggest learning the game on a low population server.  Don't expect a good time jumping into a server with 100+ people.  You will die a lot, and frequently.\n\nBuilding: great for making a base you can defend, but a nightmare for getting a lot of people into it.  If you want your base to be secure, you're going to need to need a LOT of material.  You're going to need a lot of metal doors.  If you build your place out of wood, you will need to make sure any wooden walls are not exposed to important places inside your base.  A couple explosive charges and someone will be in your base and looting everything you worked hard to get.  Our base has multiple levels with doors at the top of stairs. You can't blow through ceilings, so at the top of the stairs we have 3 or 4 metal doors (if the stairs are on the outer wall you don't need to protect one side.)  All of the important stuff you want to keep is at the top.\n\nBuilding explosive charges is expensive and time consuming, so the more layers of protection will make it that much harder to breach.  Only the person who puts the door down can use it.  This is annoying.  We've had to make multiple layer paths into the base in order to accommodate for each new player from our community who wants to join up.  Then only a few people can actually get to the top levels without needing help getting access (opening those doors).  I hear they are adding access codes which will allow multiple people to use these doors.  This will make fortifying much better and until then this part of the game is a hassle.\n\nResource gathering, go with people.  Go armed but only bring things you don't care about losing.  It might even help making a small base to retreat to or a place to dump your stuff down in intervals.\n\nKnow your surroundings.  If you know there is a clan that has a huge base and is very active.  I wouldn't go knocking on their door to see whats up.  They probably already know you're there and will kill anyone coming up to their place.  This is what our group does, and we guard the resources near our base.  We communicate a lot and we guard our territory very heavily.  Don't expect to take over a territory alone.  You'll need to scout and use your in game voice to discover things to help you out from other players.   If an airdrop is near you, expect a firefight.  They have explosives that you can't learn on your own or from blueprint drops.  You need a research kit and loot/learn one of these explosives to learn how to make the charges entirely.\n\nWe are the end game.  Our group has managed to make a name for ourselves, and the entire server knows who we are and where we're located.  While it kind of sucks hitting the ceiling and having pretty much everything we can get.  The only option is to raid bases and take other's stuff while defending/fortifying your own.\n\nThe game promotes aggression to the core so expect an aggressive community.\n\nTL;DR - Stay with friends, make friends, build a strong base.

You know that feeling you get when everyone knows what to do in a resource run that quickly escalates into a firefight? Your sharpshooter is on point with the spot, your armored point is in cover and everyone makes it out alive +yield. Feels sooo good to get it right.\n\nOnly thing that can ruin that experience is a hacker. When you do everything right, and you still get chased down by speed/aim/wall hacks, it ruins the experience. When those hackers aren't quickly, and effectively b& it can ruin an entire server.\n\nGreat game. I highly recommend it for a hardcore solo experience, as well as the budding "competitive" squad play. I would definitely be careful when considering purchasing, though. Are you emotionally stable enough to have everything ripped away from your lifeless corpse by a smug, piece of ♥♥♥♥ hacker? It can definitely happen, and it continues to. Until the servers are more secure from these embarrassments I have to give it sub-par reviews.\n\n\n----\n\n\nwanna eat fingers?\nwanna live off of the fingers of your enemies?\ngo ahead, do it.","September 1, 2015","true","317.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I have around 70 games in my library and rust is by far the most frustrating one I have. Now I'm not talking about bugs like when you have items in your inventory which stuck there forever or game crashing while trying to connect to certain servers. I'm talking about game mechanics itself - the fact that being afk your character can be (and WILL be) robbed, sodomized and killed is NOT entertaining. After spending hours or days gathering resources and making a bunch of crap you will have to disconect from the server and that's where the most interesting part kicks in. Every player on the server can do whatever he wants and usually that means stealing all your loot, destroying or hijacking your structures and killing your character (the last one is merely important, but losing all your ♥♥♥♥ means you spent all this time for nothing, have fun doing it all again lol). Unlike some other multiplayer games where it mostly your skill which matters, in Rust you will be bullied around by some douches who's played for a longer time than you have. You will be shot on sight, you will be robbed again and again even though they don't need your petty resources, it's made for fun. And eventually the same scumbugs will be ♥♥♥♥♥ing about how there are very few people left online. If someone wants to tell me I'm noob and should l2p - go f*ck yourself, I've played a lot of games and this one is the gayest. Imagine playing Diablo and having your character standing around on a monster location after you saved. And having all this loot on him disappeared. Would you buy this game? It's not something they tell you in the trailer, huh? But back to Rust - I built a house with stone walls, floors, roof, metal door with a lock. Well, guess what - there is always someone who's spent more time in game and has some OP ♥♥♥♥. When you have a rock they have guns, when you have guns they have freaking bazookas, or simply wait untill you afk. If you build a house with hardened walls and doors they will bring some C4 and will blow your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hut up, then grab everything they want, ♥♥♥♥ your sleeping character in the ♥♥♥ and kill him. Enjoy!\n\nCons:\nRead the text above.\n\nPros:\nIt has some nice graphics, much prettier than in Minecraft.\nYou can roleplay a cuckold who gets pwnd over and over again by some 12yos.","October 27, 2015","false","16.1"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","63","17","27","10","3"

Having the resources to create an actual game, garry decided to take our money, do nothing and feed us with promises, concepts and one bug fixed every week. Any respectable developer with resources can make 100 times more changes than they make a week. Garry has millions of dollars from Garry's Mod, but still develops a game with a pace of a 100$-in-a-pocket indie developer. This game either will get in "beta" stage in the 2018 year, or they will just make some pathetic excuses why they need to abandon it and develop some other "super original, new and fun" EA title. And either way I feel being scammed.\n\nLong story short, do not buy this game. Even more, do not visit the store page until, like 2016. Then if they managed to do something more than adding 20-40 models, fixing some bugs, telling you how they spent their christmas, painting 100 more concepts and adding 1198239812391 features which will be implemented "in future", you may actually consider buying it.","December 21, 2014","false","60.9"," 29 of 50 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","29","50","3","0"

Rust is probably the most fun out of a survival game.

Back to the Game, I've found the game has become less laggier over the time, which is good. I was upset when I saw that there was no SP (Single Player), but I guess they make it up with easy servers to access at any time. The Game was a good buy. I think they could introduce things such as ; Farming, More hunting & Gathering, bigger and better shelters (So our houses don't all look the same).

They're right. The first version, now called legacy was excellent and you can tell from my hours I spent far far to long playing it but then the hackers came and the 50 hours you'd spent building a base or collecting supplies were gone in seconds. When I started playing back in 2013 and they still had the Zombies it was great. Hackers were rare but when I quit there were hackers on almost all servers all the time. Usually Russians too who didn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about revealing their hacks. They ruined the game. I quit, I was fed up of losing all that gear.\nPlaying Experimental months later was just a huge case of WTF. Friends of mine said they'd get the game together and I have to admit after 10 or so hours learning it I did enjoy cracking some skulls and raiding bases but it was nothing like the legacy.\n\nFor me there are 2 huge mistakes.

In the beginning, there was Rust. It was playable. It was monotonous, but it was playable, and it was fun, and we all looked forward to the development of the game. Since then, the developers have focused more time on being pretty and less time on actually being enjoyable to play. Since I first played this game, the functionality of the game has degraded immensely.\n\nTo my knowledge, there is no way to remap controls, now. Also, you can't even open a controls option to see how to operate things, loot bodies ... or even open your inventory. Whoever has developed this since it was first introduced has simply forgotten that other people are also playing the game, and we don't know the controls the developer has mapped.\n\nNext, your first tool, a rock, can now break. What do you do if your rock breaks? Get a new one? Nope. Can't happen. If your rock breaks, and you don't have any rocks, you're $crewed and may as well kill yourself.\n\nFinally, we have lots of trees but very few rocks to harvest. Oh, sure, there's rock everywhere, but it's just texture. Rock deposits are extremely rare.

My first Blood.\n\nAfter that i was like Hungry and hurt, and it was getting dark, i managed to create a camp fire and heal my self and also made a Helmet and a bow with the cloth i had from the wolf, after that i run a little more and find the place that is called as Resource Valley, there i found 2 foundation's on a high place that would gave me a better view, i started building my house with it, made more 2. And i left to hunt stuff, and i found a guy coming my way, i was really afraid so i said Stop, and started saying if he was friend and wanted to join me up, he knew the game more than me since it was my first day, and helped me build my home, after that we found 2 guys that lived close and made an alliance.\n\nDuring one night a guy come with a HELL OF A VOICE OF A ADULT SAYING "HELLO" IN THE FRONT OF MY HOUSE THAT WAS THE SECOND NIGHT IN RUST. He looked to know how to play and after that he was gone.\n\nDays in game after, some guys found my house, and... that was the most incredible fight for life in game i ever had. The guys come yelling stuff that steam don't leave me write xD. And the PVP started, there was like 6 guys outside and it was incredible they had guns and i had like a revolver and my mate also only one, and one shotgun on the Storage, we started fighting and yelling... AND ON THAT DAY I FELT THE MOST HIGH EMOTION IN GAMING.\n\nI felt in RUST, alive, i fought for my work, for my house, for my stuff, i felt the adrenaline, it was like i was really fighting. Not in game, but if it was real life. My hands started shaking in real life (YEAH) and my body got warm like hell. I was in the fight, we did our best but my house in the ThirdFloor had an openning, and that made possible for they to breach in. I died, lost everything.\nBut i felt the most amazing experience in a game in my whole gaming life (i play since 1 year old). Rust will have you fell a true MMO Survival experience, it has some bugs, and some stuff's. And now they are working on another rust.. One that i'm waiting a little while to talk about, the next time i come to talk about rust will be about the New, and i'm going to report all my adventures.\n\nRust world is a place to find yourself as one with the nature (xD)\nThe game has good Graphics and a lot of things to do\nAnd it has one of the most intense combat system in Survival's.\nBuy it, the price for some is high. but is worth every penny.\n\nI know my review is not a real review i just sayed stuff that happened in game. But thing about the adventures i had is only possible on a good game, and rust made me a new gamer.\n\nWhen i write about the New Rust i'll make a true review.\nBE ONE WITH NATURE BOYS.","December 30, 2014","true","346.6"," 44 of 79 people (56%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","56","44","79","11","4"

Where am I? What am I doing here?  With a rock in a hand and one makeshift torch I venture to explore this uknown land to find out what the hell is going on.\n\nRust is one of the number of survival games which have emerged on the market after the success of the original DayZ mod for Arma II. It has been in development since the late 2013 and is made by Facepunch studios lead by the well-known creator of Garry's Mod, Garry Newman. It is still advertised as alpha although the game is already pretty well fleshed out. Similar to other survival games, players are pitted against each other in harsh enviroment to fend for themselves and do their best to survive.\n\nFirst things first, single rock just cannot do. I need to eat and beating something to death with a rock is a harsh ordeal. Good thing there are so many trees around. Few minutes of hitting are enough to grant me enough wood to make a spear. Next on the list is filling my belly. I heard some rustling in the bushes and soon enough, as if called by my hunger, a pig appears. One mighty throw and the poor piggy is lying face down on the ground. Filled by its grilled meat I am ready to head out.\n\nTo survive in Rust you ought to fulfill your basic needs. If you do not eat or drink you will die really quickly. Finding food on a densily populated server may be hard for a new player but as in all survival games you are much less likely to die of hunger than by getting killed by other players. Indeed it is the fellow men you ought to be afraid of most. In Rust this is emphasized even further by the sparsity of other threats. There are no NPC zombies that would eat you like in DayZ, at least not anymore. You can ocasionally run into a wolf which you can easily beat with basic weapons. Be wary of bears though which are deadly to even well equipped players.\n\nWhile sneaking through the bushes I hear a familiar sound. It is a human voice. How happy I am to find a fellow human, I was beginning to worry that I am stranded here by myself. Immediately stepping out of the bush I catch the man unprepared. He visibly flinches after seeing me and his hand clutches his own wooden spear. Seeing my smiling face and after hearing my friendly voice makes him relax a little. That is his downfall and stabs him to death while I watch in fear. I immediately rush to my newfound friend and help him up. He is hurt but lives. Now is the time to deal with the assailant. We circle each other carefully and both of us throw our spears at once and hit. Urgh, lying on the ground in pain I look up to my friend but instead of helping me, he rummages through my stuff with a smirk on his face and leaves both me and the guy who has attacked us to die...\n\nThat should do for the introduction. Now the real question is what exactly do you do? Right now I would sum up the game with the words "Survive, gather, build and prosper, just to have everything taken from you by raiders." While you can just run around in the beautiful world of Rust, explore and die, the real fun lies in building your own sweet home. To do that though, you need to gather enough materials first. For starters you can work with wood and stones which are quite easy to get. From the very beginning you can craft a stone hatchet and pickaxe which will make gathering much easier. Once you have got enough materials you can get to building.\n\nRust has a pretty intuitive building system. First of all you create a a base for you new house. You do that by stacking square or triangular pieces together until you get a desired shape and size. After you have your base ready you can add walls, windows, doors and even a roof. The system is open to creativity, which is encouraged, because your house is going to be under the constant threat of being ransacked by other players.\n\nOnce again I wake up at the coast, yeah, you heard right, once again. Since my first encounter with other people everything just got worse and worse. I got as far as building my own house, oh how beautiful it was. Three stories high with its own large furnace. I felt really high and mighty until I came across the wrong people. You see, my neighbour was spying on me so as cautious as I was, I shot a warning arrow to let him know I do not tolerate such behaviour. Half an hour later he was back with his friends with GUNS and EXPLOSIVES and in a couple of minutes my walls were breached and my house was in ruins...\n\nSo far we have gone through gathering and building part of the game but that is just a half of it. Second half is all about fighting. For your encounters with other players the game has a whole arsenal of weapons to have fun with ranging from basic weapons like swords and bows to semi-automatic pistols and assault rifles. The combat itself is pretty satisfying. There are no crosshairs but with guns one can look through the iron sights to aim precisely. Shots are affected by physics so arrows and even bullets lose velocity and drop down as they travel into distance. Everything in game is designed to look like a makeshift weapons, even the most advanced rifles and it does look awesome! Compared to ranged weapons, melee combat is very basic. Basically you just swing your weapon, eventually throw it at your foe but there is no blocking or alternative moves. Bringing a melee weapon into a ranged fight usually ends badly.\n\nWhen you feel like you have already done everything you could, have a nice place of your own, plenty of weapons and resources you can always join other players (after making sure you can trust them) and go out raiding - attack other players bases and steal their stuff. This is basically Rust's end game content and requires one to be quite knowledgable about the game as it is necessary to know different base designs and their weaknesses as well as to be proficient in combat since blowing up walls makes a lot of noise which is sure to lure in other groups. This is probably the reason why most of the raids happen during the night (in the real world) since the owners of the base are likely to sleep and there is much less players lurking around waiting for their opportunity to rob you which is kind of a shame since I believe that base defense and fights tied with raiding are when the real fun starts.\n\nAs I have mentioned before, from a technical standpoint Rust looks pretty good and not at all like an Alpha. Running on a Unity engine the game looks pretty slick, I would even go as far as to compliment the looks as amazing when you set the settings on high; However it is important to say that it is insanely demanding on hardware. If you are looking for a fluid experience with stable 60 fps on decent settings you will need a high end machine so optimalization definitely still leaves a room for improvement. Apart from that the game looks finished although Facepunch is still working on improvevements with regular updates.\n\nIn its current state I would certainly recommend Rust to everyone who likes survival games as well as to people who would like to find out what is all the surival ruckus about. Not only does everything work properly despite it still being an early access but devs also keep bringing in new content into the game quite often which keeps the game interesting in a long run. Rust is definitely worth the asked price!\n\nAfter four months I am finally getting the hang of things and the future looks bright. Despite having to start over and over I am always learning. With each breach of my house I find out what mistakes I made when designing it and my next is a step closer to perfection. While I might never build an unbreachable house, the experience taught me that it is impossible, it is getting harder and harder for people to get in and I keep enjoying myself more and more. Being stranded on this strange island slowly went from ordeal to an enjoyment and I simply LOVE IT!","May 10","true","489.4"," 25 of 43 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","25","43","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IFuckingHateMemes/recommended/252490/","IFuckingHateMemes","Horizontal Pancakes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IFuckingHateMemes/","427 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRust is a naturally occurring phenomenon when certain metals are exposed to oxygen and water for a length of time. The actual chemical make-up of rust is 4Fe + 3O2 = 2Fe2O3. The only metals that rust are steel and iron. Other metals may become corroded but they do not rust. It is an actual chemical change which takes place when metal starts to rust.\n\nEverything around us is made up of different chemicals. These chemicals are made up of atoms. The atoms can join together to create new chemicals. The atoms can also join and make up chemical compounds. Rust is a chemical compound. The iron atoms fuse together with the hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The formula for water is H2O. Adding the water creates a chemical reaction. The result can be seen as rust.\n\nLeft in a totally dry environment, iron or steel will not rust. It is when moisture is added that the oxidation process starts to occur. Because the air we breathe has moisture in it, oxidation will occur even if there is no water added to the metal. There is enough hydrogen and oxygen in the air to allow the atoms to bond with the iron. This creates the chemical reaction known as oxidation, or rust.\n\nThere are things you can do to prevent rust from forming on your metal surfaces. The first is to keep things like tools in a dry area. Rust may form even if the tools are stored in a tool box. However, the process is much slower because the exposure to the moisture in the air is decreased. If you are in a humid area, you may consider investing in a dehumidifier. This machine also decreases the moisture in the air, reducing your chances of rust forming. Things which are normally stored outside, like bicycles and lawn mowers, can be covered or moved indoors.\n\nThere are products which will allow you to keep moisture from ruining your tools and other things. Silica gel packs help to dry out the air in small places like drawers or tool boxes. Keeping a couple of these packs in your tool chest will ensure your tools are not susceptible to rust. Also, when items which are made of iron or steel become wet, dry them off as soon as possible. This keeps the oxidation process to a minimum. You can prevent rust in this manner.","June 3, 2014","true","28.5"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","15","24","6","5"

Then a couple of guys invaded an airdrop we found and decided to shoot us on sight.\n\nThis was the worst mistake they could have made, since they had no idea how vengeful the two of us were.\n\nWe regrouped and the two of us synced back up to start building a new place. We got very lucky and got a random airdrop that had C4 and explosives, and we happened upon research kits to learn how to make both items permanently.\n\nThe next day cycle in game, we went on the hunt and found where these two jackasses, and their friend were located. One of them left all of the doors open to their cabin while going in to regear. I instantly jumped inside, tracked him down and shot him in the head twice to kill him. The other two came in to help him as I killed the guy again as he spawned.\n\nMy friend killed one of them three times in a row before I finally got pinned down between the three and killed. My friend got away though.\n\nThen we waited...\n\nOnce the next cycle came in game, the three of them had logged off and it was just my friend and I left...Bad news.\n\nWe took two C4 charges with us, as that's all we could make at the time, and found their base  again. Instead of trying to blow through the series of doors, crafting more and more C4 and hoping that we were able to get in, I found a structual weak spot that lead us right into their main room. Two charges later and we were in. They all three were asleep inside, and all they had were in large containers. First thing we did was kill all three of them in their sleep and chopped their beds up.\n\nThese three had a stockpile of equipment and materials that was at least 5 days worth of full harvesting of air drops and resources from all three. My friend and I took all of the important stuff we could (C4, Explosives, material to make them both, high grade weapons, research kits and building materials) and then made a run home to unload our haul.\n\nThen we came back to raid what was left and what we didn't want, or couldn't carry, down on the ground so it would despawn and the three it all belonged to would have nothing coming back into the game.\n\nWe are now fortified more heavily than anyone on our server, and we keep finding those guy's camps and raiding them forever since they decided to kill us for no reason at the start. Sucks to be them.","January 31, 2014","true","742.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There are a lot of "quirks" in the mechanics and gameplay but overall it is fairly polished.\n\nIf you enjoy hardcore, in your face, paranoia PVP, this is the game for you.  The PVP is insane, which is not always a good thing.  The problem as with any open world PVP game is that the KOS (Kill On Site) mentality runs rampid....  Don't bother joining a server with more than 15 people on it unless you expect to get killed while neked and holding a rock.\n\nTo be successful on larger populated servers you HAVE to join up with other people, Lone Wolf does not work.  It could I guess, with A LOT of patience an slow play, but to me it isn't worth it to play that slow. But there is good news for people that want to play solo, or in a friendly environment...  There are a few player created PVE servers out there (My two favorite are Slipy's World and Lewy K's PVE Land).  PVP is turned off on these servers, and the higher damage C-4 items are either nerfed or removed....  You just have to look around for a server you like, it took me a couple of dozen servers before I found one I liked, then I created my own  (64.20.17.130:28045).\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty simple, and after an hour or so you get the basic ideas.   Kill animals for food and materials, gather wood and stone, and start building your fortress.  The controls are pretty good, context menus are available for most things, and the flow is simple to understand.\n\nFor $20, this is the best money I have spent in a long time on a game and I look forward to what Facepunch has in store for the future....   As a note, avoid the Rust subforum on the FP site....  Trolls run amuck, and the environment is very hostile to suggestions and change.  This is not a reflection of the game, or its developers, just a bunch of kids with too much time on there hands. ;) ;)","February 21, 2014","true","963.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

From if you end up starting up a rebel clan to abolish a facist bandit clan on a server that a 50k youtuber plays on or building a skybase 300 stairs high to protect you and your freinds from raiders and enemies rust offers all this and more.\n\nMy favoirite game before playing Rust was Minecraft and i must of put in a good 2000 hours into that game but only after 12 hours of playing Rust and i knew it was my new favoroite game and it is only in alpha stages!\n\nRust at the moment can provide endless fun for months on end, with all of your freinds and is still being built on, it has the potential to be so much more than it already is...\n\nworth £15.00 for a try?\n\nF**k yeah!\n\nbest £15.00 i ever spent!
