So, has the game evolved into something better with Evoland 2 or is it just more of the same with more of that gimmicky gameplay? Read all about it right here!\n\nGameplayTo be short and to be honest it really is more of the same. But it’s done way better, for the most part. While the first one was to-the-point and focused (maybe a bit too focused) this sequel takes the time to expand on pretty much everything. But, like everything, this has some positive and negative effects.\n\nFirst of all, the script has been upgraded. This in turn makes the story much, much longer and more fleshed out and it might possibly make you feel for (one or more of) the characters that accompany you on your journey. There are some funny moments and a whole lot of references to popular movies, TV shows and other games. It all still is rather linear, though, so I guess that hasn’t changed, and it also feels too ‘old school’ at times, but just wrapped in a more modern package.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531355732\nThe engine has also been upgraded to allow more types of gameplay to be shown. While there are still gameplay sections in it that you have also already played during the first game there are now many more. I can’t list them all I’m afraid, partly due to the character limit and my memory, but a few of the new gameplay types included are puzzles (clearly inspired by Professor Layton), music segments (clearly inspired by Guitar Hero), shoot ‘em ups (‘bullet hell’-like games) and stealth (clearly inspired by Metal Gear Solid).\nI personally think it’s incredibly impressive to have an engine that can handle and show all these different types of gameplay and graphics without breaking a sweat. And I haven’t encountered any loading screens either, now that I think of it (except for the initial loading screen, but that speaks for itself I think).\n\nThe problem with having many types of different gameplay is that, even though there are a lot of fun ones, there will always be genres that people just dislike and maybe even hate. Now that most of these gameplay types have been expanded upon it’s possible that parts of it might start to drag or bore sooner than the developer had hoped for. I personally hated the shoot ‘em up part; it felt that it took too long and it was also quite challenging. But, then again, you can’t please everyone. But they certainly tried, that’s for sure.\n\nHowever, none of the added gameplay types really add anything to the game, but like the first game it’s a fun ride if you’ve been playing games all your life or if you are just interested in game history. You will see a lot of different types of gameplay come by during your playthrough.\nBut I can’t help but wonder if the game would’ve been even better if they had focused on just a couple of gameplay mechanics (the ones you would normally see in other RPGs plus a few unique ones) instead of adding tens of different, sometimes even useless, genres and mechanics. Probably not, though.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531355768\nAnd even though it’s just a small part of the game the puzzles are, everything considered, well done, except for one or two. Unfortunately one of them even ‘broke’ the game for me as it became unsolvable. I am talking about the mammoth puzzle, which I was unable to solve on my first try. It’s actually really easy, but I did something (read: chose poorly) and wasn’t able to solve the puzzle because of it. With no way to reset the puzzle or fix it I had to load up my previous save game, which was fortunately just one or two minutes earlier. A bit sloppy, but I can forgive them.\n\nAudio & VisualsThe music is exactly what you would expect in a game like this. It has a modern, symphonic soundtrack, similar to a lot of other soundtracks from years and games gone by. Rest assured: it’s not plagiarism. And somehow it also still has that retro feel.\nThe sound effects are also great, with a lot of beeps and ‘plings’ that we all should be familiar with I think. There is no voice acting, by the way.\n\nLike the many genres included the game also has many (although not as many) different graphics. These range from 32-bit 2D and 2.5D to 3D, and each has its own style. It all runs at a solid 60FPS, too, and the colors just pop off the screen; they’re very vibrant and sharp, which I always love.\nBut in comparison it looks mostly the same as the first Evoland, with naturally some improvements added here and there.\nAll in all Evoland II manages to keep the graphics quality very consistent for the entire duration of the game. Another impressive feat for such a lengthy game!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531355823\nLength/Replay ValueWhere the first Evoland took roughly 3-4 hours to complete the length of the sequel has been increased to at least 19 hours, and most of it feels like proper content and not just filler content.\nYou can put in even more hours than that if you want to collect absolutely everything so all things considered it’s definitely worth the asking price. It might not be interesting for the entire duration, but almost every game suffers from that problem in my opinion.\nIt’s also not a game that you will replay often; once you’re done with it it’s likely you won’t play it again until at least several months/years later, and most of you (including me) probably won’t ever play it ever again. Still, absolutely worth the asking price if you ask me.\n\nConclusionWow, Evoland II sure managed to impress me. I expected more of the same to be honest, which is definitely true, but the sequel pretty much improves on every aspect of the first game. It doesn’t make the game perfect – there are still a few flaws here and there – but I absolutely like the direction it’s heading into. There are also still a few too many gimmicks gameplay wise, but if they promise to take care of this in Evoland 3 (either by removing them or fleshing them out) then I’m sure it will be nothing short of amazing. An amazing love letter to videogames (as well as other media)!

It never really did anything with the "changing game types and dimensions," and its story was bare bones simple, and at times non-existant. It was all a vessel for a continuous joke, or reference, that if you didn't enjoy, would not keep you engaged.\n\nThis game manages to out-do what the first one did by having a solid foundation with its gameplay, and story that actually means something. I'm 2 hours into the game and it has yet to throw any of the previous progress I've put into it out the window for the sake of a joke. Any reference they throw in, whether it be Professor Layton, Zelda, or Final Fantasy feels surprisingly in place with the type of game this is, and far from forced like in the first one. On top of that, the writing is really enjoyable, and so is the musical score. The only part I didn't really enjoy so far was a stealth section, that lasted a bit too long, and wasn't even that enjoyable to begin wtih. Overall, the game is just a really enjoyable experience so far, and I highly recommend giving it a check, even if you weren't such a fan of the first game.","August 25, 2015","true","2.3"," 92 of 103 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","92","103","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/myrhdin/recommended/359310/","myrhdin","Myrhdin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/myrhdin/","269 products in account","I didn't play the first Evoland game, but when I had the opportunity to meet up with Shiro Games on gamescom 2015, the first thing they told me was that they took the time, over a year, to analyse what could have been better on Evoland and make sure that their next game would show an improvement. I just finished the game, and I can clearly tell you that they did, all in all, a good job with this new Action-RPG title.\n\nOne of the most critical points for Evoland was that it was far too short and it somehow let people empty-handed. My first playthrough, played very casually but still trying to unlock additional content, just clocked at 23 hours, in-game time. Even if some stages or scenes can feel a bit lengthy, there's always something to do in this game: you can progress through the story, you can explore the world and try and find hidden chests or new items or you can spend hours trying to defeat tough opponents in their card game.\n\nYou are never bored when you explore the world of Evoland: there is always a hidden reference for you to catch. You will be meeting up with characters from your favorite video games (Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite, Sakura from Street Fighter, Lara Croft...), you will notice items coming from different universes (mention to the Valley of Wind shop with Captain America's shield on a wall just next to a Buster Sword and Link's Hylian shield). To be honest, at first, I even thought it was too much, all the time, and I had the feeling that this game might even get sued for being just a huge pile of copyrights infringements. But when you decide to play the game for what it is, a sort of homage to past glories like Chrono Trigger or Secret of Mana, you are just having a blast.\n\nNicolas Decasse, one of the developers, introduced himself as a huge fan of Chrono Trigger, and the scenario of the game clearly shows it: the plot of the game will have you travel through time, using magic stones erected by a now disappeared civilization, while making sure you learn that this power shouldn't be messed around with and that your actions can have dire consequences. As every hero, Kuro, your avatar, will meet new friends on the way, and create special bounds with him. They will help him explore his environment, and he will be able to call on their power to progress through the game, by removing obstacles or creating paths for him. Once their power is fully unlocked, you will be able to use special summons for each of your three partners, like you would be able to in Final Fantasy 6 or 7.\n\nTime travel is represented in a way that a lot of retrogamers are going to enjoy: depending on the era you're in, the more old school the graphics. 8 bits for the past, 16 bits for the present and isometric 3D for the future, you won't be able to forget in which era you're wandering. To explore certain areas, you will have to switch very regularly from one era to another, as some of the puzzles will involve removing obstacles or getting specific items in a different era to progress in the timeframe of your mission. This feature is very nice, but to be honest, from times to times, it just hacks the story telling: backtracking to one of those special stones to change something in another era before going back to the original era you come from and go back where you were is just a pain, at least in the first hours when you have no way of transportation.\n\nHowever, Evoland 2 always finds a way to renew your interest, by breaking the habit and having the player to explore regularly new video game genres: you will have for instance to defeat a boss in a versus fighting mode, you will try to save an entire civilisation playing a tactical RPG mode, you will have to escape a mountain fighting your way through a bullet hell... You never know what to expect in your first playthrough, and I certainly didn't expect to have to play a mix of Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero in an Action-RPG! My only problem with that is that it reinforces the general impression that the game is just a pot pourri of references and that it lacks a bit of personality: you play a game that talks and shows more of other games than itself.\n\nOne of the main criticisms I'll have for this game is that some of the puzzles it offers are just extremely hard to solve, and not because you need a master's degree to solve them.  No, I'm just referring to some tricky hitboxes or silly point of views that actually make you think you're stuck when you just have to move a couple of millimetres to see where you need to go or finally manage to destroy something that was blocking your way. I spent one hour looking for an exit in a forest, knowing where the only exit was, and not managing to open it because of the hitbox of the bush I was supposed to destroy was very tiny and made me think that I couldn't go there just yet. But all in all, the puzzles are kind of tricky in the game and you will have to think for a couple of minutes to solve most of them (just have a look at the discussion boards on Steam and check the numbers of "Blocked in XXX" threads).\n\nAll in all, I can only recommend this game to all players who are somehow nostalgic of the golden age of Action-RPGs, who have a massive geek culture or who are just looking for an enjoyable game to entertain them for about 20 hours. It has some downsides, for sure, like the fluctuating rhythm in the action or the fact that allies are reduced to a very supportive role (you never get to fight as one of them), but the diversity in the gameplay and the many references, served with a brilliant soundtrack, are making Evoland 2 a very enjoyable game.","August 27, 2015","true","37.2"," 57 of 66 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","57","66","0","0"

No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nThe original Evoland was somewhat of a surprise gem, utilizing some of the best features and gameplay from RPGs of the past. Expertly blended together, Evoland was a fun unique experience. Evoland 2 does nothing less than the same, crafting a wonderful experience using gameplay elements and mechanics from not only RPGs, but many other genres and series as well. You will see a lot of influences from many games, and many direct references scattered throughout. Even some pop culture references!\n\nGameplay\n==========\nEvoland 2 is an action RPG first and foremost, but at times it changes up its style for periods of time. In one segment of the game, you are able to explore the field much like in the classic Secret of Mana style, attacking enemies that wander around the field. In the next segment, you will be platforming through a dark dungeon very reminicent of the old Super Mario titles. This change of style helps keep Evoland 2 fresh, and it lends this feeling of excitement to the game where you press on to see what type of changes come next!\n\nAs the style changes, so do the graphics. You will start your adventure with what looks like the classic Game Boy look, black/white/grey pixels makign up your character and the world. This quickly evolves into a better 2D top-down look, in full color and a bit more detailed. Further progression sees full 3D being implemented, increasing the depth and overall look of the game. The original Evoland was all about going through the history of video games, and Evoland 2 still retains some of that feature.\n\nThe original Evoland had a traditional turn-based RPG battle system, with a few changes here or there. In Evoland 2, combat is much like Secret of Mana or The Legend of Zelda: enemies are out in the open--you can walk up to them and whack them with your sword while avoiding their attacks. Much like Secret of Mana, you also get a few companions as you progress. But unlike Evoland, they do not join you in battle directly and take their own turns. Instead, you can charge up a Focus Attack that will cause your partner companion to unleash a special attack. After using this, a short cooldown occurs before it can be used again. These Focus Attacks are not only ways to battle enemies, but they are also used to interact with the environment. Menos' attack, for example, can be used to damage groups of enemies or destroy blocks, boulders, or other such obstacles on the field. These abilities can be upgraded as you progress and collect Maana.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nThe overall look and feel of the game changes as you progress the story. At first, it's very simple: pixelated and colorless. But as you progress, it goes full 3D and filled with color and detail. No matter which stage of the game you are in, even the very beginning, the game looks amazing. It just keeps getting better as you go!\n\nCharacter sprites at the beginning look nice enough, and when they hit 3D mode you really notice the little details. Attacks looks better, environments look better, everything just looks so much better as you go! It's really amazing how well the art direction of this game was handled.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nOne of my favorite parts of Evoland 2 is the soundtrack, especially in the Haunted Forest. The soundtrack perfectly matches each situation you encounter, the town you are visiting, or the dungeon you are exploring. Cheery, playful tunes for the towns set the mood for them well, and the dark, foreboding songs of each dungeon really make you feel like you are really there in the damp darkness. There is some very light voice acting, at least thus far, in the form of shouts, grunts, and other similar sounds. Swinging your sword is satisfying, as is the sound when hitting an enemy.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nEvoland 2 runs flawlessly on my rig, which I like to call a low mid-tier build. 60 FPS at all times, with no lag or slowdown. No frame drops whatsoever were observed. It plays perfectly with my Logitech F310 controller, with no prior setup. The default controls were spot on and easy to acclimate to. That being said, a controller is highly recommended.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nIf you enjoyed the first Evoland, you will undoubtedly enjoy Evolnad 2 as well. It's a great nostalgic throwback to the games it draws some of its features and mechanics from, and you will surely recognize where a lot of them come from. Tons of easter eggs and references are scattered throughout too, making it an even more nostalgic experience. A must buy for fans of the original Evoland!\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/FS6R3o6Q3yU\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","August 29, 2015","true","7.1"," 49 of 59 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","49","59","5","3"

Some of the different gamemodes are just a blast, I especially digged the tactical rpg part, but some of them (I'm looking at you, Bejeweled) are just -horrible-. I played the entire game on hard, except for this one Bejeweled part that is literally impossible when your enemy just deals 90% of your life in a single swipe.\n\nApart from that, here's the deal. The game is amazing, yet it manages to annoy you every so often. Some parts are super tedious, occasionally, I just wanted to see if I could re-enter a certain gamemode or stage and then I had to play the entire level again because there's no option to turn back. Same thing with some sort of stealth segment, turns out, if you talk with a certain guard and hit yes (I wanted to see what he replied...) you go straight back into jail. However, even though there a lot of bugs and glitches, it was still super enjoyable. Because the plot is well done, the music is amazing, the gameplay feels (for the most part. ♥♥♥♥ Bejeweled.) good and the controls are tight and responsive. It really sets you back with a bazillion references to older games. I don't even want to spoil a single one, so you can experience it for yourself. So, after this short wall of text, let's review.\n\n+ Amazing Gameplay for the most part.\n+ Stunning visuals. (Mostly the Pixel Art though)\n+ Amazing humour. Yes, it is THAT good.\n+ Stays true to what it does. (Basically, the different gamemodes feel like they should, is what I'm trying to say.)\n+ Time Travel Mechanics really add to the plot.\n+ Now that I mentioned it, the plot is pretty sweet too, with a satisfying ending.

I did notice some people complain about it being too open ended, which is not really the case.)\n\n- Tedious Mechanics, occasionally.\n- Bejeweled\n- Bugs/Glitches appear way too often, expect to restart the game or quit to title occasionally.

The progressive graphic and gameplay improvement is not in this game, and it focus A LOT more on the story than the humor. Don't get me wrong, there is definitely humor and satire, but less so than in the first Evoland. Now, on to the real review.\n\nEvoland 2 is a fantastic game. Absolutely fantastic. Evoland 2 is mainly an RPG that plays very similar to The Legend of Zelda (like A Link Between Worlds or The Minish Cap, not like Ocarina of Time or Skyward Sword). You may know Evoland as a game that tried to make fun of the other types of gameplay and gaming itself. Evoland 2 doesn't "make fun" of others games, but it mimics them. For example, you'll be running around in LoZ style gameplay, then you enter an area, and all of a sudden it plays like Final Fantasy, or it may play like Fire Emblem in another area. Just note that the main gameplay is LoZ RPG style, but you'll be forced to play very differently in some areas. Note that when it does change gameplay, the difficulty isn't all that hard (except the Street Fighter spinoff...ugh...).\n\nThe different gameplay can vary from a side-scrolling brawler to a match 3 kind of thing, or from a tactical RPG to a rhythm game. The different gameplay is actually what seems to keep the game interesting. Honestly, if it stayed like LoZ, it would've gotten terribly boring after awhile.\n\nThe story is a much bigger focus this time around. The first Evoland didn't really focus a whole lot on the story, and this game makes up for it. If you don't like convoluted storylines, then sorry. But both the gameplay and the story work really well, and if you're the kind of guy that skips the story, it's still a fun game, you'll just be confused. Also, see my playtime? That's 1 regular playthrough. Not a 100% run, not a speed-run. I ended up with 67% completion, if you need a scale of reference.\n\nAnyway, do I recommend this game? Absolutely. Yes. This game isn't just an RPG, it's a lot more. If you're not sure what kind of genre you want to get into, and you like RPGs, then get this game. There's a lot of diversity, and it's a lot of fun. Even if I mentioned a certain genre that you don't like, get it anyway. You might like it.","October 19, 2015","true","18.8"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","0"

There all fully fleshed out with a lot of depth to them and could perhaps make complete games in their own right.\n\nReferences: It features tonnes of references to movies, games and TV shows as well as others. Some are rather obscure and others are very stand out but all of them add a lot to the overall experience. These include things like doctor who, mario, zelda, star trek and probably loads more that I didn't even notice! I believe they even made a reference to themselves at one point by making fun of the random encounters in the first game.\n\nStory: One of my biggest flaws about the original evoland was the boring story that it had. But this isn't the same with the sequel. The game is a wonderful intriguing story that holds itself well throughout the entire game. It features twists and turns. Each character is unique its own way and there are loads for you to talk to you. The dialog each character gives you is fantastic and it really gives them a personality. The story is set among time periods as you travel backwards and fowards through time.\n\nGraphics: Each time period has it's own unique graphics style. They represent different periods in the eras of RPG's. The game styilizes these periods excellently and manages to put so much detail into them. I'm particularly fond of the games present era which I believe to be styilized the best of them all and I was always amazed by the beauty of it whenever exploring the world.\n\nSoundtrack: A wonderfully crafted soundtrack full of so many different songs. Each area you explore seemingly has a different track attached to it. The game even has varients of many of the tracks for different eras of gaming. The tracks perfectly fit the areas you are exploring and greatly and to the experience.\n\nLength: The main story took me a full 21 hours to complete. A great length and such a difference to the original that only took me 3 hours to complete. There is still tonnes more for me to do in the game as I am currently at 70% progress.\n\nBosses: Some of the best bosses I have seen in a game before. Each are unique and completely different to anything i've seen before. They are all frustrating difficult to complete though. The final boss took me over an hour to complete.\n\nNeutral\nChanges: If you absolutely loved the original then you definitely won't find the same experience here. It doesn't teach you about the eras of RPG's very much at all in this game. It definitely isn't it's main focus. But instead you manage to get a well fleshed out experience. I'm neutral on this because I believe the original concept of the evolution of RPG's was too limiting for them to fill a full game with it.\n\nNegatives\nBugs: I did manage to unfortunately experience a few game breaking bugs throughout. These included getting stuck in the world and a boss fight that froze and wouldn't finish. They hit me a few times meaning I had to restart the game to be able to continue. They were frustrating. But luckily you shouldn't have to deal with these problems. I posted onto the steam forums these bugs and the devs managed to fix them within only a few hours!\n\nLeveling up: The game features a leveling system when you pick up experience points. When you level up you gain either life, defence or attack statistics. The problem I have with this is that you don't actually get to choose what's upgraded. The game chooses it for you leaving it feel rather pointless. The other problem I have is that the entire world seems to level up and get stronger with you meaning you don't feel the progression. This may be more of a general problem I have with all RPG's though.\n\nControls: I would strongly recommend a controller for this game. Keyboard has horrible key bindings that can't be changed.\n\nOverall\nI mean overall evoland 2 is a fantastic well fleshed out RPG with tonnes of variety and a great story. My negatives aren't too big of an issue and won't cause you to have too bad of an experience. So I think this game should appeal to everyone and should definitely be played by everyone! The price may seem a bit steep but for the amount of content you get it is well worth it!\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!","September 6, 2015","true","27.2"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","25","30","0","0"

From overhead slasher and turned based fighting to a platformer or even a street fighter style fighter. This may seem like way too much for one game to have, but all of the segments are done well and are tons of fun. Another great part to Evoland 2 is the endless easter eggs and references to other classic games. (Everything from Super Mario to Metal Gear Solid) Throughout the game you get to travel through different time periods trying to figure out who you are as well as helping your friend return to her home. While you are going through the different time zone the games graphics change from SNES all the way to full 3d. I am not the biggest fan of this game genre, but I can really appreciate a good game when I play one. Evoland 2 does almost everything right. The two things that I didn’t like about this game. The first glaring problem is the many glitches, sound and visually. I had many problems with in game sound constantly repeating even when trying to reload the game. (I had to completely close and restart the game to fix the problem) The second issue I had was the fact that the games combat didn’t really become harder after the first 4 hours, but the change of gameplay helped fix this for me. Aside from these two problems I enjoyed every second of my time playing Evoland 2 and would highly suggest picking it up.\n-HiPFiRED\n\nPros\nGreat Soundtrack\nChanging Gameplay (All of Them Are Fun and Well Done)\nChanging Visuals are Awesome\nThe Narrative is Very Interesting and Well Woven into the Gameplay Elements\nLoads of References to Many Classic Games\nThe Characters are Very Memorial and Funny\n\n\nCons\nCombat Difficulty Never Really Got Harder\nMany Visual and Sound Glitches (Most Can be Fixed with a Game Restart)\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n","August 31, 2015","true","16.3"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","31","41","2","0"

The game’s world is rich with backstory, the characters are entertaining and the original content is far more enjoyable than I ever imagined. The game is however buggy, and you will need to restart the game a few time. Small patchable flaws aside, this game is a thoroughly enjoyable tale of time travel and destiny. The use of different graphical styles is something truly memorable and engaging, and this time it’s been used as an effective storytelling tool as opposed to a gimmick.\n\nFirst and foremost, Evoland 2 does almost everything better than the series’ overly disappointing introduction. The use of different graphical designs are now integral to the narrative, representing what era your group of time traveling heroes are currently in. The story has been drastically improved, offering a much deeper lore, with pivotal moments in its history. The characters are engaging, and their dialogue is fun and sometimes even heart-breaking. Simply put, if Evoland was a shoddy attempt at a good idea, its sequel is the redemption.\n\nWhile the first game felt like it was pandering to its audience, throwing any random gaming reference at them, Evoland 2 pulls back the needless illusions and allows the gameplay to do more of the talking this time around. This pleasant change allowed the developers more creative freedom, and it shows in this instalment.\n\nThe story is about a young man who’s discovered in the woods by a girl named Fina. The two of them venture out, seeking his true identity when they end up getting involved in a confrontation between an empire and a group of enslaved demons. They’re suddenly whisked many years into the past, and begin their journey towards discovering your identity, stopping a destructive war and returning everyone home.\n\nWhile Evoland barely had a story to speak of, Evoland 2 addresses the problem with a vengeance. The plot thickens as you progress through a story clearly inspired by Chrono Trigger, as new twists seem to pop up after every new quest. Themes such as free will, destiny and prejudice are used as a driving force, and it makes the game all the more enjoyable. You constantly want to get to the next quest, and I was delighted when I was rewarded with new exploratory options. There’s something about old RPGs, where something as small as getting a paddle boat is somehow amazingly liberating; something that many modern games don’t seem to get right.\n\nLike the classics mini-games of the past, Evoland 2 nails mixing up the gameplay. In one section, you’ll jump into an Active-Time Battle system ala the Chrono series. These ideas could’ve been phoned in, but the developers at Shiro Games included a nice simple selection of moves and even environmental conditions for this mode. You’ll have to time your attacks, as the lights cut in and out or when you’re avoiding electrified floors that’ll nullify your attacks. These modes are not just RPG inspired either- they also have a space shooter segment, where Galaga fans will feel right at home blasting their way through enemies. There’s even several bosses, all with their own patterns to figure out. There’s a 2.5D fighter segment, side-scroller platforming, Bomberman inspired levels- and it does all of them right. There’s even a card game. Okay- that one does suck, but has there ever been a good card game in an RPG?\n\nOne thing I can’t ignore though, are the glitches. Oh man- this is truly heart-breaking. I had to restart this game more times than a thirty dollar android phone. Graphics would simply drop out. Mine carts would randomly appear on the tracks preventing me from progressing. Sound effects would suddenly loop in-game, even when I went back out to the menu. My goodness, what a horrible state this game is being released in. While it was annoying, backing out of the game is fast, and I could always get back to where I was quickly- but I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention these grievous oversights. I will say, the game feels ambitious, so a few glitches can be expected, but these were pretty hard to swallow.\n\nAnd I think that might be my biggest complaint about the game; all the references. While I laud the developers for running with a ‘parody all the games’ mind-set, they’ve now tuned the machine so well, it’s actually quite good without a gimmick. When you stumble upon a reference, it only pulls you out to remind you that you’re playing what’s ‘pretending’ to be a game. The reference may be light enough, like seeing Sir Dan from MediEvil in a dungeon’s corner- it’s when that reference becomes too obvious or obnoxious that it really hurts the overall mood of the game; like finding a mystery box straight out of the Mushroom Kingdom. In a game packed full of allusions, some are going to work, and some are going to make you shake your head in disappointment. Thankfully, the game has more winners than losers, but those stinkers reared their head in all the wrong places, including a poorly timed Professor Layton reference right at the beginning of the game.\n\nThanks for reading a selection of my review.

Still I have to admit that the easier difficulty level'd be good enough for any player afraid to be excessively frustrated and most people'd be able to complete the game without wanting to throw their keyboard/ controller out of the window if they stick with it.\n\nIf you find its action rpg roots, mix of gameplay and tons of homages interesting then Evoland 2 is an easy recommendation and will easily give you several hours of good, old-school fun.","December 20, 2015","true","19.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

However, while it does use some technology stuff, it is far from the focus of Evoland 2, and instead it decides to look at the games that have made gaming stand out. It looks to the various generes that have come and some of gaming’s best ideas, and plays with them some, while celebrating everything gaming can be.\n\nThe standout thing for Evoland 2 is the writing. Evoland , is quite simply in my opinion one of the smartest and wittiest written games I’ve seen in a long time. While Evoland 2 utilizes a lot of the same Hero’s Journey path you’re used to seeing in games, it executes it incredibly well for the most part and utilizes what is there to the best of its abilities, while surrounding it with a lot of incredibly smart writing.\n\nRead the full Review[techraptor.net]","August 25, 2015","true","31.6"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","26","41","0","0"

Do note that I try to prevent spoiling as much as I can as I write this and this is all my opinion.\nA little background, I played part 1 (Evoland) and enjoyed it, though it was more of a time killer than a real game, which in my opinion isnt bad, but could be better. The sequel changes this and is a worthwhile game!\n\nEvoland 1 was lots of fun, where the game evolved as you played through the game, music became more detailed, colours popped up, 2D became 3D, 8-bit became 32-bit music, I loved every little part of the game. But the only issue I had with it was that it was incredibly short.\nThe sequel doesn't grab the same "evolving gameplay" that Evoland 1 had, however it does so differently which really suits the game. You see lots of different game genres that most of us have enjoyed through the years, from the 90's to the 00's games. All boss fights are different with new kinds of strategies necessary (literally, because the game mechanics keep changing from Double Dragons to Megaman to top-down shooters).\nThis everchanging gameplay allows for loads of enjoyment and sometimes even surprise because some titles were enjoyed in the past, but sadly the names were forgotten. This game brings them all back and allows you to re-live your most cherished moments in gaming history with just a single game.\nThe little card game also allows for an enjoyable time waster (in a good way, because I enjoyed it). The mechanics of the card game as really easy to grasp, pretty similar to Yu-Gi-Oh or Hearthstone in a way, but then you get to enjoy the thrill of collecting all cards and a good aspect as well is that if you win from a certain person, he will give you the card you are supposed to win. Nothing random, although winning once from a single person is enough, because the wins afterwards are just for funs and gigs.\n\nThe only issue I have with this one is that the replayability (finishing the game more than once) leaves some things to be desired once you have cleared it 100%. (But I will most likely still play this game again some time soon in the future.)\n\nSo in summary,\nYou cannot really complain about the graphics of this game because it just looks awesome, playful and changes all the time by swapping from past to future.\nGameplay is very enjoyable, there are some hard bits if you aren't used to the way those games are meant to be played, but they are easy to understand and require some practice.\nThere is the possibility of leveling, giving you more health, it helps but it doesnt allow you to become overpowered, which is good in my opinion because it keeps the challenge present, while also giving you an edge of not taking the effort of leveling at all.\nThe music was enjoyable, from nostalgia to pleasant, in my opinion nothing weird.\n\nIf you like to have a good time playing a game, enjoy a few laughs, collect cards (without having to spend ages for getting all of them), don't mind the nostalgia trip this game will take you through, I'd say get it!\nYou may want for it to become cheaper, because in my opinion 20 euro's may be a just a tad too high, because the replayability of this game isn't very high. So anywhere from 10 to 15 euro's and its a good buy (in my opinion! <-- important, because opinions differ).\n\nHope it helps those who aren't sure of investing in this game.","May 8","true","33.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The chests also gave you reason to hunt down all collectables into hoping that you would upgrade the game... however in Evoland 2 that feature is gone and the game developes as the story does... although this is fun it gave little fun of discovery the chests in this game only lead to continue the story or have collectables inside.\nI know I have talked about the chests alot but that is what gave the first game so much charm.\nthe story in this game is quite engageing and the game itself had many references to other games that almost everyone knows and loves.\nThe visuals are to be as expected, with them being better than the firsts but not as stunning as most modern rpgs\nThe controls are very natural and nothing all that complicated or hard to remember.\nBut all in all this is a wonderful sequel and a great game however I would probably recomend the first game over this one mainly due to the fact that the game Evolved as you ventured.\n4/5","August 26, 2015","true","16.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

As you progress along the story graphics change from 2D top view (ancient pixelated looking one), side platform and the last part is 3D top down view, which shows how advanced these developers were to pack everything into a nice game that is totally worth buying. I spent only 7hrs playing it, but it offers alot more - 24+ hrs of gameplay on story itself, or 50+ if u're looking to get all the achievements.\n\n\nAs a fan of APRG games, Diablo, Grim Dawn and Van Helsing series I must say this game just got a place in my heart and i would definatelly recommend it.","October 13, 2015","true","7.8"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

Recommended for any fan of 2D Zeldas and anyone who enjoyed the first game. If you're in neither of those categories and the concept alone doesn't make you desparate to play it, wait for a sale.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nGameplay:\nIt's impossible to delve into too much detail here without spoling what games Evoland 2 mimics, and that surprise is the heart of the game. Like the first game, E2 takes place primarily in three eras representing approximately the NES, SNES, and mid-early 3D eras of gaming. Also like the first game, it apes Final Fantasy (and now Chrono Trigger) in its story and most frequently takes its gameplay Zelda titles like A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening. E2 remains highly competent in this department, but problems start to arise when the gameplay tries to explore other genres. The game steadfastly refuses to use any buttons beyond the arrow keys, shift, space, and tab even when that means compromising essential functions of the games it's trying to imitate. The benefit to this approach is that the game never needs a second tutorial, but the price is that some segments feel incredibly simplistic and suffer as a result. Other segments were simply outside the expertise of the development team and have serious design flaws. Still others are poorly explained.\n\nThankfully, none of the bad segments stick around for long. You'll remember the frustrations for how egregious some of them are, but in terms of time there's far more to like than dislike. The game knows it's better at certain genres and largely sticks to them.\n\nSound:\nInconsistent. There are a few really good tracks, a lot of mediocre ones, and a theme that was so awful I muted the entire game for the brief time it was playing. The sound gets the job done in-game, but I can't possibly recommend buying the OST for full price.\n\nThere's a lot of audio-skipping/freezing in the game as a result of a nasty bug that occurs seemingly randomly during transitions and loading of certain special attacks. It happened around two dozen times in my game and sometimes lasted around 5 seconds.\n\nGraphics/Performance:\nThe 2D sprite worlds are quite well done and the 3D graphics do what they need to. I didn't run into any performance issues except on my laptop (Intel HD 4500), which struggled with the 3D world. Loads are all very quick in spite of the above audio issues.\n\nStory:\nE2's story follows E1's theme of being a blatant Final Fantasy parody, but this time around the writing is better, more serious, and more extensive. It's not about to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, but there are some geniunely funny moments and the plot as a whole does a great job of staying entertaining. It even manges to be a time travel story without too many blatant plot holes, which is a rare accomplishment.\n\nValue/Replayability:\nLasts around 16 hours if you're just trying to get through it. Completionists can probably add another 5-6 on top of that for optional puzzles and quests. There's no NG+, but you can load your pre-final boss save and continue playing with access to (almost) everything.","September 11, 2015","true","18.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It was a game that I had high hopes for, seeing how it claimed to be the game exploring why we love video games. Instead, what we got was a joke, a parody. Something that wasn't worth it's price point. There was so much potential in it that just never got realized, and while Evoland II doesn't full realize everything, it still delivered more than what anyone expected. This isn't some kind of parody game, this is the real deal. This is Evoland II.\n\nPros:Way better than the original in every way; all of it's aspects have been ramped up.\nLonger but better paced\nMore Gameplay styles\nGreat Graphics\nGood Soundtrack\nCharacters and Story are likeable\nMore game references, but it doesn't obnoxiously make it the only part of the game\\nBetter presentation\nEnjoyable Writing\nNitpicks:Soundtrack can get grating at times due to looping\nDifficulty Curves and Spikes\nRPG mechanics like XP aren’t deep and somewhat unnecessary\nController must be on before you open the game, otherwise it doesn’t detect it.\nStory is while simplistic, also very abrupt at times. Something happens, and then it’s forgotten for the rest of the game.\nCons:All gameplay styles/genres are not half-baked, but basic and don’t have much depth\nFairly buggy\nPacing can utterly be messed up by it’s puzzles and changes in gameplay\nThe Review\nEvoland II starts out pretty slow, and you'll know that despite the tutorial mimicking the first 2 minutes of the original Evoland, you jump straight into the Present day, which's graphics look a lot like a typical 16-bit JRPG. Evoland II's art style and graphics are a significant step-up from the original, with great pixel-art and it looks a lot more interesting and lively. The 3D areas lack some polish regarding graphics, but they still are nice. The artwork in this game is great, it's clear that compared to the simplicity of the original game, Evoland II strives to make itself presentation-wise much more bigger.\n\nGameplay-wise, Evoland II is way more bigger in terms of scale and mechanics. There are a lot more puzzles now, some which could take a bit to get through. Compared to Evoland's laughable "puzzles", Evoland II offers some neat challenges. They had a Professor Layton-themed puzzle right at the beginning, and it was pretty cool (and really easy as well). A lot of the combat is still more of the hack-n-slash kind of repetitiveness you'd probably expect, but the game mixes it up with tons of different game modes. Up to the 2 hour mark, I played through your typical Zelda/Secret of Mana gameplay found through the most of the game, 2D platforming (Which to my surprise is probably one of the gameplay styles you'll play a lot), stealth (which will certainly remind you of Metal Gear), and a Diner Dash-themed minigame (Which while a bit ehh, certainly wowed me, because Diner Dash!). There's probably way more different types of gameplay styles and genres to be found here, and they seem to all have different playtime. However, Evoland II is always the Zelda-like RPG it is and these extra game modes simply break up the gameplay when possible.\n\nThe emphasis on puzzles in this game is greater. No longer is it pushing boring switches or going to different corridors, they're full-on challenges that's difficulty can be that of Zelda. The game doesn't explain everything traditionally, and you'll most likely figure things out trial-and-error. It's one of those games where you'll walk around for 40 minutes looking for an objective and realize it's right behind you. It's creative with it's puzzles and while they can stump players very, very hard, they are quite unique.\n\nThe thing about these genre/styles is that they're down to the core. They all work and are playable, but are very basic and down to the core mechanics. The RPG mechanics (Which is a large part of the game) such as leveling and getting gear just provide simple stat boosts that won't change a lot of things beyond said stat boosts. This means that they all don't have much complexity or depth to it, and this is also compounded by the fact that the game's button layout is basically like the Game Boy. I've only been using the X and A button on my Xbox 360 controller in addition to using the LS to move.\n\nEvoland II's double edged sword is how it explains things. The tutorial does not specify what buttons work, and the game itself generally asks you to figure out things for yourself. This creates a sense of a Zelda game, but because the mechanics in the game (As well as how some gameplay styles work) aren't explained well for the player to make the best of it, it faults those who don't know how to play a lot of these gametypes. The game throws you into something and expects you to know how to play through it. A simple picture depicting the controls would be fine, but Evoland 2 makes the transistion both simple, and confusing. The worst example of this is the Bejeweled-like gameplay mode, which has a lot of complexity to it that isn't explained well, thus making it difficult.\n\nThe game is also quite buggy, which is a shame. Graphical errors like a particle effect randomly displaying, things not appearing, and more can happen while playing, which requite a restart. It also doesn't detect a controller while the game is open. If you turn on your controller when the game is already open, it won't detect it. A minor nitpick. The audio stutters, the game struggles to load textures correctly each time you boot up the game, there was a point where the developers made a dungeon impossible to pass through due to trying to fix a bug. Shiro Games should have more communication with us players on the game via Update Notes in the game's announcements or their twitter, because it seems like Evoland II has not been fully patched to be more polished.\n\nEvoland II's story is passable, but it marks a lot of sins by simply not explaining things. The ending is cryptic, weird, and ultimately kinda unsatisfying, and the story likes to drop major events like they never happened. Regardless, the writing makes up to it. Evoland II makes up for this by showing it's confidence through it's writing. While it does play not-so subtle game references everywhere, there's times when the game is just legitimately funny and successfully convey these jokes in a less bothersome manner, like how your main character has this blank, emotionless stare in it's dialogue portrait, like how a lot of your dialogue options are simply "Yes or No", it plays with the aesthetic found in many of these games, but doesn't overplay the joke. It's over the top, but in a way that makes it feel unique on it's own. The game doesn't always have to make jokes or references to make you laugh, sometimes it's just what the characters say or what happens.\n\nSo what do I think of Evoland II? It a fantastic redemption of a once-shallow game, and pays a good homage to everything I love about video game.\n\nTL;DR - A cool, nostalgic game that's entertaining for all.

If someone else has made a game, we'll reference it!\n\nSigh...I enjoyed the first Evoland as a fun, quirky trip through RPG history without to much substance.  Evoland 2 tries to have a more grandiose story and more varied gameplay, but...it's so frustrating, clunky, and...unfun.  Where do I start...the music is repetitive and painful.  Turn it down early and often.  The graphics are charming and we go through a number of different palattes but overall it feels very thrown together.  The story and script try very hard to be funny, but they're...just not.  Not really.  And the game modes...Evoland 2 tried to throw as many game modes into a blender as possible to appeal to everyone.  If you've seen the trailer, it probably looks cool, right?  The rpg modes, the fighting game modes, the shooter modes...except that no one thought to ask if these SHOULD be thrown together.  These modes are all very clunky and clumsily executed, go on for way too long, and are frankly, tiresome and frustrating.\n\nThe game, on the whole, is glitchy and buggy in many small ways, from controls locking up after passing doors, to the poor hit boxes, to the overall inexperience and clumsiness we feel in some of the newer modes, fighting game especially.  In some cases, there is a distinct lack of clever level design, such as the frustrating megaman style jumping sections on disappearing and reappearing blocks when we shift to side view.\n\nThis game feels like it was trying to copy Chrono Trigger in story and be a grand ride through game genres in execution, but it fails to do either.  The story falls flat for me and the game modes, while varied, are poorly executed at best, especially the 3d segments.\n\nGive this game a pass.","November 6, 2015","false","5.5"," 51 of 98 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","51","98","3","4"

Just like any RPG there are people to talk to, items to find, upgrades on weapons and powers, bosses to fight, etc.  Because the Evoland games make puns and witty game references there's humor too.  The developers really did a good job with this one!\n\nAs for game content you'll be happy to know this game gives a shout out to lots of classic video games even TV shows and movies.  Some game mechanics or things you find in the world are obvious of where they originated but some are subliminal and may miss it if you don't pay attention.\n\nSome of the obvious references and gameplay that's in this game:\nLegend of Zelda (lots of similar gameplay and I even found the sword and shield hanging on a wall, right next to Captain America's shield)\nChrono Trigger (time travel and game mechanics)\nMario Bros.\nJRPG's\nBejeweled\nBomberman\nPokemon\nGuitar Hero\nHearthstone (yes there's card battles in this game)\nDr. Who time vortex\nArcade Fighters (including Street Fighter)\nVertical and side-scroller jet shooter\nSide-scroller and 3D overview gameplay\nHack & slash and turn-based battles\nRetro and modern graphics\nThese are just a few.\n\nSome of the subliminal content:\nHarry Potter\nMinecraft\nCaptain America\nTomb Raider\nTMNT\nTerminator\nStar Wars\nEvoland 1\nFrozen\nChronicles of Narnia (I could be wrong on this but it came to mind.)\nAgain, these are just a few.\n\nPros:\nLots of gameplay and story.\nDoesn't get boring and repetitive like EL1.\nMix of retro and modern graphics/music.\nReferences...references everywhere!\nOne game but feels like lots of games in one. (Mixed gameplay)\nGood ending.\n\nCons:\nSome dialogue is a bit lengthy. (Only in a few places.)\nNo "quest marker".  This isn't like Skyrim where you have quests but if you take a break from this game for a couple of weeks you may return and forget where you were going.  I've had to look up walkthroughs on a few places just because I didn't know where to go or where to find a certain item.  I wish it had a marker to nudge you where you need to go.\n\nSide note:\nIf you were like me and wanted to play the card battles, don't rage quit.  Just like any other card battle game you'll lose a few before you start winning.  When you gain new cards you'll start to win some.  I originally was going to list the card battles as a Con because I thought they were unfair but later on I found the game is fair and after I won several cards to add to my deck it became easier to win.  Just keep trying and you may have to travel around and find a few easier opponents to win cards.  It's not required for the story so don't sweat it.","January 9","true","28.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you have a nostalgic pixelheart then Evoland 2 is the perfect game for you. The game is much longer than the first Evoland and it has many nice references to games you would call "classic". The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Prof. Layton, Mega Man, Street Fighter, Super Mario and Bomberman are a few examples for that what awaits you in Evoland 2. In spite of everything Evoland 2 is primarily a rpg. But do not expect a serious story with full of emotion. Evoland 2 combines alot of humour with an interesting but shallow time traveling story.

The game does not lack wit or character, but I feel as though it lacks reward. Other than fan service and heavy-handed references, the gameplay felt like it existed simply for the sake of the story (which I feel was rather convoluted). As a player, I laughed a lot and got frustrated more often. Not to mention I felt it lost sight of what made Evoland special in the first place: the gimmick.\n\nAs a favor to yourself, play the game halfway through and then delete it. The entire second act of Evoland II is rife with tedium and frustration; it almost feels like the game is punishing me for wanting to see it through. The only reason I continued playing (especially through the TERRIBLY designed side-scrolling bullet hell) is because I felt invested.\n\nPlay it, enjoy its quirks, but don't expect a masterpiece.","May 13","false","25.1"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

I'll try to keep updating the review as I progress through the game.\n\nFor the moment here's what I think:\n\nPros\n- Nice and colorful\n- Lots of (quite obvious TBH) references to other games\n- Witty item descriptions\n- Really nice animations and more generally sprites\n\nCons\n- Dialogues seem to have been written for a *very* young audience (but then the game is full of references to Metal Gear Solid, Super Mario, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and many other games which makes you think that the game is actually targeting people around their 20s and older). I wasn't expecting amazing scripts but nonetheless, sometimes the dialogues are just.... meh.\n- Mechanics are a bit clunky for the moment (in the 2D top-down view it feels like you should be able to swing your sword diagonally rather than just up/down/left/right), don't know if they'll get better as the game gets more "modern"\n- Similarly, save points. Seriously - you have a chance of making an retro-style game with modern mechanics. Save points are horrid, just let us save from the pause menu.\n- Main character does not say a word and always replies with "..." but it can interact sometimes with yes/no choices. I feel he likes of personality and you can't really make it up yourself because of the standard "..." answer. The game doesn't let you imagine what he's saying, it *tells* you what he's saying, and he's saying that he's just a big duck.","May 9","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

With Evoland 2 - just buy it, I can guarantee you'll love it.\n\nWhen I first began playing Evoland 2, I won't deny it, I was initially disappointed. It isn't exactly like the first game, which is pretty much what I expected. I would have been disappointed if it had been a carbon-copy of the last game because there wasn't much you could roll with, but that was what I EXPECTED. You get thrown into the brand-new storyline, and it wasn't anything like the previous game at first. When you first play, if your initial expectation is Evoland 1 but with... I don't know, new graphics? You're going to be disappointed. Do not let this colour your experience of this game. Don't listen to those reviews - if you're after Evoland 1, go play Evoland 1 - this is Evoland 2, it is bigger, better, and far more enjoyable in my opinion (and I thought Evoland was great fyi)\n\nEvoland 2 is a fantastic game, it's well rounded, the storyline is FANTASTIC, the game mechanics are done well, the soundtrack is killer, the characters are full of depth and they're original, they aren't your classic cliches. It literally has a bit of everything, just like the previous game - we've got sidescrollers, your traditional RPG, your new 3D RPG landscapes, there's stages of fight em' up, space invaders type scrolling, tower-defence style RPG, tekken-style fights, pretty much everything - heck, there's even a secret island that's full of Zelda-inspired cuccos!\n\nThroughout the game there's a million and one easter eggs with throwbacks to your favourite classics, done tastefully. There's even a card game on the side that is done incredibly well - you'll have just as much fun finding the cards as you will playing the game - heck, it's something I think would work quite well in hard-copy.\n\nI've spend 24.5 hours playing this game in the last two weeks alone. This says a lot - it was so much fun to explore, so much fun to play, so much fun to experience. Yes, there were some insanely hard stages that I found very difficult to pass, but it didn't detract from the game, this was merely a reflection of my skill (ie. I can't play Guitar Hero for sh*t).\n\nAs an added note, I highly recommend playing this game with a controller. It is playable with the keyboard, and I played through about half the game this way, however, you will probably find that playing with a controller makes it a lot easier to mash buttons when needed - but it is in no way a necessity - I would definitely recommend it for players who struggle through some stages (like oh my god the Biblus miniboss, my poor fingers).\n\nOverall - I think the only criticism I have of the game so far is its replayability - when you're all done, you do get warped back to the very last save point before the final boss battle - which is okay because you have all the opportunities then to go back to each time period and find the remaining stars or cards you might have missed - but that's literally the only negative. I haven't enjoyed playing a game this much for quite a long time, and I highly recommend it.","December 7, 2015","true","24.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Ok, first of all, buy this game, buy this game now. It's byodiful, it's got so much content in it that makes me think the developer is an actual time traveller to have enough time and money to put it in. But...BUT...and this is a big butt (I'm so sorry). This game...this game is hard as nails at some points. Ok, evoland, I get it, the first one was pretty much just a joke game, and now you want to make sure we're aware you're a proper game now, I get, but for the love of god, don't put the words "Challenging but fair" on your default difficulty, this game is challenging but fair the same way dark souls is challenging but fair on its default difficulty. A lot of the bosses have the infuriating tendency to use a move that is ffffricking specificaly made to take advantage of you in the dickiest way possible "YES, EVOLAND, I'M AWARE I GOT KILLED, COULD YOU TELL ME AT WHAT POINT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SURVIVE THIS BOSS CLUSTER BOMBING THE ROOM?"\n\nBut the question with difficulty is "Is it difficult in a good way" to which I would reply "There is no good kind of difficulty, I wouldn't thank my landlord for making me go through a death gauntlet to get to the empire biscuits" but its actually quite good. It feels very retro, which is bloomin' ironic because funnily enough most of the excruciatingly hard parts take place in a retro feel. Aaaand that's about as far as i can go without going into spoiler territory. Basically, this game is like my last girlfriend, it's good parts are very, very good, but when it wants to f**k you over it will do so and leave you with a significantly lighter wallet...ok maybe not that last part. 9/10 almost almoooost perfect.

The first one was open and went between different games all the time. This game throws that out the window and let you keep playing the same style over and over again. You will see different styles, but only for a few minutes. Two I want to point out are the shoot-um-up and the street fighter genre. They are both not good made and feel weird if you played another game from this genre. the shoot-um-up doesn't respond well and dying sends you way back. the street fighter genre is even worse. you have no time to try the style out and the one youre fighting knows all the moves. SPOILER WARING: But in his second face he just spams the moves. It could be a great game but when I played this section the moves didn't work. I played on a controller but every time I tried anything the boss got cheap and just kept spamming attack after attack. Last is the Professor Layton puzzles. these are not good. What made professor Layton games so great and helped the gameplay were the notes, the well thought out puzzles, the text to always knows what you were doing again and If you good the answer randomly good, you at least could see why it was good because the game told you. This game does not have any of it. some of the puzzles are good and some are just guessing. If you don't read what you had to do and didn't write it down. you had to start all over again by watching the cut scene, talking to person again and trying it all over again. This may seem like little things, but if you played the layton series and liked it, you will get annoyed by it. This game could be great but does so many things wrong.\n\nShort version:\n\nIf you liked the first game and how it worked, don't buy this. Its not the same. It has a lot of genres but they are worked out poorly. Just play the official games of the genre.

It's byodiful, it's got so much content in it that makes me think the developer is an actual time traveller to have enough time and money to put it in. But...BUT...and this is a big butt (I'm so sorry). This game...this game is hard as nails at some points. Ok, evoland, I get it, the first one was pretty much just a joke game, and now you want to make sure we're aware you're a proper game now, I get, but for the love of god, don't put the words "Challenging but fair" on your default difficulty, this game is challenging but fair the same way dark souls is challenging but fair on its default difficulty. A lot of the bosses have the infuriating tendency to use a move that is ffffricking specificaly made to take advantage of you in the dickiest way possible "YES, EVOLAND, I'M AWARE I GOT KILLED, COULD YOU TELL ME AT WHAT POINT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SURVIVE THIS BOSS CLUSTER BOMBING THE ROOM?"\n\nBut the question with difficulty is "Is it difficult in a good way" to which I would reply "There is no good kind of difficulty, I wouldn't thank my landlord for making me go through a death gauntlet to get to the empire biscuits" but its actually quite good. It feels very retro, which is bloomin' ironic because funnily enough most of the excruciatingly hard parts take place in a retro feel. Aaaand that's about as far as i can go without going into spoiler territory. Basically, this game is like my last girlfriend, it's good parts are very, very good, but when it wants to f**k you over it will do so and leave you with a significantly lighter wallet...ok maybe not that last part. 9/10 almost almoooost perfect. The only reason im not giving it a 10 is probably to blackmail the developer to make a third installment.","September 7, 2015","true","25.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has an interesting story, with lots of twists and it is pieced together as you play the game. I enjoyed the story in this game more than many books.\n\nThe game starts as a hack-and-slash with puzzle elements. For some sections there will be a sideways perspective instead of top-down, and you will be able to jump and use sword beams. In most modes you will be able to call in assists from your party members.\n\nAs you play Evoland 2, you will travel through time, and as you travel through time, the graphics change. Traveling into the past will make the graphics less detailed, while traveling into the future will make them more detailed and 3D.\n\nAlong with changing graphics styles, the gameplay style will also change. This happens very often, and incorperates gameplay from a large number of classic games, such as Bomberman, Street Fighter, Double Dragon, Fire Emblem, Guitar Hero, and many more.\n\n\n10/10\nHighly Recommended","November 29, 2015","true","29.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm not a completionist for most games, but this one I intended to do all the 100% work before beating it - that's how much I liked it. This game is very challenging and switches combat styles as you play the game. (some last longer than others, but all are no pushover) It's intended to challenge avid gamers. Not to mention, it has a lot of gameplay. I'd say about 24 hours AT LEAST. I spent 37 hours on the game.\n\n+ The game's storyline is very strong and that's something the original didn't have (the storyline for the first came in later on) I quite enjoyed all the silly commentary from even the most remote of characters. A large part of the first portion of the game is actually figuring out what's going on.\n\n- The biggest gripe I have is this game adopts the Mega Man style of bosses that touch you and you take tons of damage, but it feels so good to take out those bosses!\n\n+ Another joy of this game is finding all the "easter eggs" in the game. References to all sorts of games are all over it, even if you are not currently playing in that game's style.\n\nIf you like Mega Man/Megaman, The Legend of Zelda, Street Fighter, Final Fantasy, Pirate101, unique games, or challenging games. Evoland 2 will certainly perk your interest.","December 29, 2015","true","48.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

I spent ~16 hours going through the main game.

The game adds different game genres midgame and, crazy enough, they all seamlessly flow together. This game went beyond what I was expecting (video game tropes for the entirety of the game and rushed sections for the added genres.)  Evoland 2 brings tons of original concepts and overlays them on top of established game mechanics (and still includes the tropes that I was expecting.)\n\nHands down\n10/10\n","December 30, 2015","true","18.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Evoland 2 is a game that puts Gameplay over Story. The graphics in this game range from the old "Gameboy-green-yellow Graphics" to new 3D-Models. This Evolution in graphics was the matter in the first game. This time Gameplay gets a lot of changes and it is a welcome change. While playing the game, the game will swap between different Combat-Styles. You have the "Street Fighter" Combat style at some point, later you command your own army and sometimes you just solve puzzles to defeat the enemy. When you don't have to fight something Evoland 2 wants you to explore the World. There is lots of Stuff to collect and details and references to discover. Also sometimes you get to a 2D Platforming section.\n\nIn the end I really recommend this game, since it is something different than most games. If you are into retrogaming you will surely like this game more than others. Still I am sure that also other people can enjoy the 18-30 Hours of playing they are going to have.","November 29, 2015","true","22.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Period.\n\nEvoland 2 is the perfect game if you need something to kill time with, or looking to have some fun. It includes many different game styles, with none of them feeling remotely awkward next to each other. This game also looks great, and sounds great as well. What other game will have you command an army like Fire Emblem only to lead up to a Guitar Hero boss fight, or a platforming section that leads up to Bejeweled, all while being able to play a smaller version of Hearthstone on the side. To top this off, this game is overflowing with references. I don't even know how many there are (but i suspect that there's over 9000).\n\nRating: 10/10\n\nIf you are a lover of all kinds of video games, you will love this game.","January 6","true","27.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay is extremely varied, it has a unique mechanic regarding time travel that alters the graphics of the game, and there are also lots of references and jokes to other games in the genre making for some funny moments in a somewhat forgettable story. The story itself isn't bad, but it's nothing special. As long as you don't take it too seriously and ignore some of the paradoxes they've most likely created, you should find the story somewhat enjoyable.\n\nSeriously, this game has the most varied gameplay I've ever seen. A good amount of the game is spent in the Zelda style top down view but there are sections where it goes completely 2D and turns into a platformer, a section where the game goes Final Fantasy style completely turn based, a Street Fighter style boss fight, a bullet hell segment, and even a village where you fight people in a modified version of Bejeweled! Every time I get to a new section, it feels like I'm playing a different game. This game does a lot to make sure it's not repetitive.\n\nAs much as there is to experience in this game, gameplay varied to this degree does have it's drawbacks. When you have so many different genres melding into one game, you're going to lose people at one point. Some sections you'll have a blast with and will be disappointed when they're over, while other sections will bore you and you'll be glad when that segment ends. Personally, I enjoyed the Bejeweled section but I was having a hard time getting through the Final Fantasy part since it felt like all I was doing was the same commands over and over again for every battle. Another unfortunate problem is that since the game has so many different mechanics regarding all the genre shifts, they aren't as fine tuned as their respective games. This was especially true during the Street Fighter segment. The controls were pretty clunky and when I pressed pause, it would show my moves list but not only did it disappear if you go to another tab but it also didn't list the move that uses your special meter.\n\nSince Evoland 2 borrows a lot from other games, it only makes sense to have a little fun with it. I had a good laugh when one of the ladies in town said I should be wary of a boy wearing green clothing who goes into people's houses and smashes their pots. As for the main story, there's not much to say really. The game starts off with a main character with amnesia cliche but after meeting the girl who took care of you while you were out cold, you quickly start your adventures through time. The characters all have funny dialogue and do have character progression. It is a time travel story though so expect some paradoxes and the usual confusion that comes with quantum physics. With the amount of jokes it makes towards other games and even at itself, I don't believe the story is too serious. As long as you don't expect it to be the next Mass Effect or something with it's storytelling, you'll most likely enjoy what the story has to offer. Now the interesting thing about time travel in this game is that when you go back in time, the graphics do much of the same. It starts out looking like a Gameboy Advance game but when you go to the past, it looks like somewhere between NES and SNES. Going into the future makes the game go entirely 3D which could definitely pass as a late Gamecube/PS2 era game. With a mechanic like this, it makes exploring the world in two different time periods interesting in more ways than one.\n\nEvoland 2 is a pretty decent game. I finished the game in 15 hours with a 67% completion rate so for you completionists out there, you can easily get another 5-10 hours out of this game. While the first Evoland was more of a brief parody of the adventure game genre, this game was more focused on standing out on it's own. They've taken a bunch of different gameplay styles and mashed them into one game. With all the references to other games, this game feels like a retrospective of not only what the adventure genre has branched off to, but also to what gaming has evolved into in general. We may have started out with simple games like Pac-Man and Super Mario but now we've got side scrolling beat em' ups like Final Fight, strategy RPG's like Fire Emblem, shoot em' up games like Star Fox, and so much more. I feel like that's where this game shines the most. It does have it's problems but in the end, it was nice to experience a taste of all the different genres the gaming industry has created.","January 9","true","15.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While you travel through three main eras (think NES, SNES, and modern) there are many times where it switches to a totally different game genre for a one off joke or a boss fight.\n\nYou'll fight someone a la Street Fighter, play Bejeweled with some dudes, and shoot down enemies in both over head and side scrolling shoot 'em up style levels.\n\nAnd here's the problem.\n\nSome of these new modes control like crap, and are just awful in general. The over head shump was by far the worst part of the game. Not only is it a really bad shump, but it drags on for way too long. It also does this with a segment that wants to be an endless runner.\n\nThe game isn't all bad. There are some neat time travel mechanics that remind me a bit of Chrono Trigger, with your actions in one time having an effect on another.\n\nThere's also a card game you can play against various NPCs, but it is really bad. Your deck just consists of any cards you have, so if you unlock some crappy cards before some awesome ones (which is bound to be the case) have fun drawing those useless things since there is no way to edit the deck.\n\nYour opponents in this card game also have life values that jump all over the place, while you are locked at 20hp. It feels like they are giving them more life to artificially make them more challenging fights instead of actually constructing better decks for the opponent.\n\nWinning at the card game puts you at the mercy of the RNG. You can lose a fight time and time again, until it finally decides to give you a decent card order, and then you'll stomp it. It's sad, because there is a decent CCG hiding in here if they had just worked a bit more to make it something you can actually apply strategy to.\n\nMy biggest complaint, by far, is that there is no run button. Your character movies painfully slow, and I can't believe they didn't think to let you run. There are tons of unused buttons, so I don't know why they did this.\n\nEvoland 2 is much longer than the first game, and I think it's worth the price, I just wish it had gotten a bit more polish.","February 11","true","22.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This leads to some interesting changes in the future as you change the past, and makes getting all of the collectibles fun. The game is somewhere around 25 hours long, but it is even longer if you try to get everything. The different genres are done well, and the main story is even pretty deep; there are some crazy fan theories about the ending. Overall, the game is very fun and I strongly recommend it if you are interested at all by the trailer or the game descriptions.","December 13, 2015","true","32.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Game.\n\nIf you enjoyed the first Evoland game, you might be in for a slight dissapointment. But, before you go on and rant on how it's not exact. Read on. The reason for this 'dissapointment' is because Evoland 2 steps away from the linear straight-forward evolution of video game progression. Instead, Evoland 2 gives you all that the first Evoland had, improves, rewrites, and adds to it in a fantastic blend of multiple gameplay, graphics, and also a satisfying story that will keep you on your toes.\n\nThere is multiple genres of gameplay, including 2D platforming, Mortal Combat-esque battle, Tactical Turn-based, and also many, many others.\n\nIn Evoland 2, you start within the 'present', which is a sprite-based full-body graphical style. Evoland 2 main story-line involves Time-Travel. Going to the past will have graphics revert to more 'ancient' looking apperance, but still retain a modern fludity that will leave you breathless. As you go toward the future, it will transition to an 3D graphical apperance.\n\nWith Time-Travel comes the different gameplay methods as mentioned above. Though they will make their apperances as you progress through the story-line.\n\nOne of Evoland 2's main features is its companions. These memorable friends of your character each have their unique personality and abilities. Their abilities are neccessary for both story progression and completionist objectives. I personally found my first green-haired girl companion, whom I named 'Sinai' to be my character's best friend. I truly cared for her comments, personal story, and the way she acted.\n\nThere are a few segments I did find a bit irritating, sometimes overchallenging. In a few instances I had to tone down the difficulty from classic (Normal) to, uh, this game's version of 'easy'. If only just to get past and continue the story which I eagerly awaited to see it's next part.\n\nThe true Final Boss was not totally unexpected, and also seemed to come a little out of nowhere. It was one of the few kinks in the story that lacked some development. I wished they had fleshed out the Final Boss's story a bit more for me to actually care about the character instead of viewing her like somebody I just had to beat to finish the game.\n\nAlso, there are references everywhere... I spotted three clearly Dragon Ball Z references. And a whole lot more. But it's not a bad thing, it adds a certain flavor that fits well with Evoland 2, given its prequel.\n\nMy personal rating for this game is a solid 9/10. It's fantastic, keeps you interested, is fun to play, but does have a few annoyances and story-related holes. But don't let that deter you, Evoland 2 will keep you wanting to play, and if you love collecting things, you'll expand the 18-20 hour story to an addition 22-26, possibly more.\n\n","November 24, 2015","true","21.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Plenty of funny little details are also in there, so it's worth exploring and also seeing what the world looked like in different times.\n\nIt also provides a small challenge in the combat which isn't always a walk in the park and also a couple of cool puzzles.\n\nI recommend this game for anyone to play that enjoyed their GB-NES-SNES-N64-etc. games.","March 10","true","25.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Evoland 2 is one of the eye-candiest games I played.\n\nPlot:\nIn this game you control <insert hero name here>, who travels through time-space using ancient artifacts. The different time periods are easily recognizable by the different art-styles (Big fat pixels, pixels, 3D). After a kind of accident, you end up in a different era and your quest is to go back in time, to the time that is yours(?). However, on the way then (not there, *then*), you discover what the future holds and... well it's not all fun and roses. So like any good time-space traveler, you decide to alter it. Hum.\nThe story is very, very rich. You might at first think there are caveats, but fasten your seatbelt, you're in for a number of surprises.\n\nArt:\nThe art is incredible. The game is very lively, colors chanting.\nThe music is nice, too, though not exceptionnal IMO.\n\nGame style:\nThis game is one of puzzles, retro games, old-school boss fights and parody. You'll certainly meet lots of people from other games, find books written by famous people.\nPushing pipes around, serving in a restaurant as fast as possible, jumping on roofs, good old platformer levels, use a flying machine...\n\nLast notes:\nI didn't expect to play so long. I didn't expect the game to be so long. I pushed some extra $5 on the humble bundle (that, at time of writing is still ongoing) to get it after thinking "oh, that looks fun with a Street fighter remix and Pokemon-like graphics". Now, I'm contemplating when I'll ever finish this game and go back to my time to play some other games of the bundle... ;-)","May 12","true","26.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I couldn't finish the game.\n\nI really loved the original, but the "evolution of gaming" magic is gone. It happens so late and after so many story hours (3.5 hours that felt like 3.5 years), that when it finally started, I just wanted to keep playing like I did. The 3D polygons felt so nasty that I just couldn't keep on caring about the characters. The game that I got used to was replaced with something that I wanted at first, but now it was too late. I just wanted to finish my pixelated adventure.\n\nThe game was fun at times, but more frustrating than not. Everything felt slow and sluggish from start, heck, you can't even run, and up to the point I was playing it felt more like a classical SNES era JRPG - with some bothersome mini-games that I just wanted to get over with.\n\nPlay the original Evoland instead. There, the "gimmick" is really a part of the game, and not just a bothersome mini-game.","May 17","false","3.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's just the same as the first 2 hour game stretched to 20 hours. Both games have really dull gameplay, but what kept me motivated in the first game was the constant evolution of the graphics. Not only is there less of that in the second game (which is 10 times longer), they also changed the way you get these upgrades. In the first you started with nothing, got better graphics, controls, music and so on. In the 2nd game you start with like 16-bit graphics or something and already have music. Then go BACK to 8-bit or something (I don't know if these terms are correct), then you go forward again to 3D-graphics. The feeling of progress is lost because of this.\n\nThe story is more fleshed out in the 2nd game and the dialogues are well written, compact, but have depth. However there are also a lot of cliche things and obvious developments which make this story feel like it's just there to be there. What's really annoying is when the developer tries to be funny. I examined a chest, my character says "I could open this if the developers had the time to design this feature". That is like the most wannabe 4th wall break I've ever seen and it's not the only one, there are a lot of lines like that.\n\nWhy am I still recommending this game? Because it's not so bad that it deservers a negative recommendation, gameplay is dull, but functional, story is simple but motivating, and with 20€ the price is not too crazy. Most people won't regret the purchase, but if you want to be sure you should definitly wait for a sale. However I refunded my purchase, because it didn't feel like a game worth playing (which doesn't mean it's bad).","September 8, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

It had charm, and though it was short, it didn't have any real padding to speak of. Disappointingly, I can't say the same for its sequel.\n\nIn the two hours I have played so far, I have seen so many mind-numbingly cliche sequences that if I didn't know any better, I'd say this game was just a paint-by-numbers exercise in game development. I've already gone through the boring tutorial, the forced stealth section, the generic coliseum, and I decided it wasn't worth continuing when I hit the sewer level filled with insta-death pits and bats. That's not even mentioning the plot so transparent that at least 2 of the major "twists" are already in plain sight, or the unimaginative characters.\n\nI'm sure that there are people who will argue that it's satire, or a loving parody or somesuch. Thing is though, simply implementing a well-known setpiece doesn't make something satire. Satire requires you to implement it, point out its prevalence, and then give an alternative, or twist it somehow so it's not the same as every other time you've seen it. I would have greatly appreciated it if, for example, midway through the stealth section your companion just knocked out a guard blocking the way forward, letting you bypass the circuitous route through the patrols. Instead the concept is played completely straight, right down to the cardboard box.\n\nI want to love this game. I really do. I might even keep struggling through its numerous flaws in the hope of finding something good underneath. But if you want a skilled satire of RPGs, I suggest you look elsewhere unless you have a strong desire to waste a few hours on tedium before anything fun shows up.","May 10","false","1.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yooniqda/recommended/359310/","yooniqda","ㅇㅁㅇ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yooniqda/","62 products in account","IntroductionThis game is a MASTERPIECE, the idea of the game itself (evolving gameplay) is a very brilliant and unique concept and it already deserves a plus point just because of that. The length is very acceptable, completed my first playthrough with 100% completion and 100% achievements within 20 hours++.\nI won't talk about the game itself, like what you can find in the game, but I'll talk about my impressions about the game.\n\nGameplayGameplay is the strongest point of the game imo. Evoland 2 offers you a variety of gameplay and the game really able to accommodate the concept to the game. All the changes in the gameplay is smoothly corporated into the storyline. Yes, there are a couple of genres that feels a little bit 'forced' but in the end it doesn't break the immersion. All in all, I feel like the storyline and the gameplay complements each other very well.\n\nThe thing is, you won't find any deep gameplay system. Some people might find it as the weakness, but I find it as the strength of Evoland 2. With the 'shallow' gameplay, you don't need long tutorial and most of the time, you basically will be able to play purely with your instinct only. And with the constant changing, you'll be able to explore what each gameplay able to offer just in time before you move on and change into another genre.\n\nThere are only 2 weaknesses that I found.\nFirst, just like someone else mentioned, you're bound to find a genre that you don't like. Especially, naturally some genre will have more playtime compared to others.\nSecond, some genres are repeatable, but some are not which is a pity because I enjoyed some of those genres.\n\nThe difficulty itself is quite fair. I find it doesn't too hard but still challenging. I was able to get into level 30 with just a little bit of grinding. The puzzle in various parts are quite challenging too. It's like, it's not that obvious, once in awhile it still has that 'AHA!' moment for me.\nThe collectibles and achievements all are reasonable. They need some effort but not too annoying that forces you grinding like hell.\n\nAlso, I don't know whether it's just me, but I really enjoyed the Card Game. Actually it will be fun if we able to play it with other players.\n\nStory & ScriptFirst, all those references to other games, I think it was very interesting and funny sometimes. It makes me keep entertained and keep on wondering whether this particular dialogue is just another script or a reference to something else.\n\nNext, about the story of the game itself. This part gave the biggest impression for me, simply because I didn't expect it at all.\nOn my first hours of playing, I thought the game will just have a simple story. However it does able to keep me entertained and hooked until the end. It's a little bit linear, but I'm not a fan of open world game myself, so it does it just right for me.\nThe most interesting part is, right after I finished the game, I still thought the story is too simple and such. But after that, I pondered more about the story esp the ending of the game. Then I looked for discussion about the ending to confirm it and I was right. When you really pay attention to all the small details throughout the game, the story is actually pretty awesome. It does play with your mind and left me fascinated with it. There are still indeed lots of lingering questions in my mind. But overall it's very nice. In fact, it gave me the same feeling like when I finished watching a Nolan's movie.\n\nOthersThe changing graphics is actually great and makes me feeling nostalgic too.\nThe BGM are pretty nice too.\nI saw some people complained about hit boxes and such, however I didn't find any bug or annoying technical things like at all.\n\nConclusionEvoland 2 is a very recommended game, especially when you're familiar with various popular title from different genre since the older generation of console. During my playthrough, I kept on looking forward what's the next genre that the game will give me and also what reference of other game that I'll find.\nThe various genres, the jokes, the story, the changing graphics, all of them complements each other so well that they  make a complete and almost perfect package.\nEvoland 2 is a very unique title and I can see myself replaying it again and again in the future :)","February 3","true","22.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A story taking the best of Chrono Trigger, The Legend of Zelda, and Lufia, is merely the tip of the iceburg.  Including full sections dedicated to other games including Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, Double Dragon, Fire Emblem, Professor Layton, Raiden, Gradius, Street Fighter, Mega Man, Metal Gear Solid, Bomberman, Chrono Trigger, Guitar Hero, and Secret of Mana among others, Evoland II shows the best of these games' genres without holding onto worn out mechanics.  Sprinkled with 4th wall jokes and pop culture references, each new moment in the game brings fun and nostalgia with small allusions to great games, such as waking out as Chrono, or the chain walls from Super Mario World.\nWith an absolutely great ending, Evoland II is a most player for all gamers, even those who didn't like the original.

The soundtrack is okay, no songs really stuck out to me, yet none of them bothered me either. The story is about as generic as you can get, and the characters don't fare much better.\n\nFor what Evoland tries to be, I think it succeeds, and that makes it a game worth picking up.

Nothing is necessarily difficult as long as you're good with different types games or a fast learner.

On ths plus side, the game does save rather frequently, but I've had enough. Sound also "stagggers" and cuts out momentarily at random/\n\nIn addition to the technical issues, this game does not feel like a sequel to the first entry in the series at all. The first was a very, very brief adventure in which you collect upgrades to the very -world- you play in, such as music, 32 bit graphics, etc., and the game concludes not too long after you've obtained all the upgrades to the world, giving a short and fun experience.\n\nThis sequel, however, appears to be trying to make a legit action RPG that will last in the teens or twenties of hours (I took a peek at Howlongtobeat.com and confirmed this), and even goes backward from graphical improvements at times. The biggest problem with this is that the story is very old school / simple with a lot of cliches and references to pop culture/other games, meaning it's the same thing as playing a lot of the RPG Maker games out there, except this one will look far worse for much longer because of the deliberately retro graphics.\n\nThe reason the first game worked was because the graphical improvements were progress, and the game was so short that the ugly graphics at parts didn't outstay their welcome. Here, the retro graphics set up shop for what appears to be hours on end. Please keep in mind that I like the old Doom better than the new one, so graphics are hardly my normal go-to for enjoyment of a game.\n\nThis game isn't awful, but it's deliberately an eyesore and goes on for far too long to have such a hum-drum story. Neither the plot nor the game mechanics have me wanting to continue, despite my enjoyment of the original.","May 22","false","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I really do. It's just not very good. The story is a blatant rip off of Chrono Trigger, but not in a funny or interesting way. There's no satirical commentary on RPG tropes to justify it, it just is. The humour consists entirely of referencing other video games. Every reference makes me cringe. "A guy dressed in green did a thing" is about as creative as the humour gets. It's lazy. Plus "It's dangerous to go alone. Take this" automatically loses points in my eyes. For shame.\n\nThe varied gameplay styles just amount to a bunch of half-baked underdeveloped short games. The base gameplay is a mediocre Zelda clone with a charge mechanic. It's nothing special, but it kind of works. Everything else is tedious and drags on way too long and the pacing is all over the place. The last straw for me was going through a long frustrating vertical platforming segment (with ♥♥♥♥ing disappearing Mega Man platforms - those are bad enough in a game with tight controls let alone in this mess) directly to a boring top-down shooting segment that never ends and then right in to a bad Street Fighter clone where you win 4 fights in a row by button mashing. It's all completely unnecessary. I wish they scrapped all of the boring underdeveloped fluff and just polished up the base game more.\n\nThe main gimmick, the changing graphical styles, is pointless. It's kind of neat at first but has no relevance to the plot and doesn't affect the gameplay at all.\n\nI can't imagine why people are rating this game so well. I grew up on NES, SNES, and PS1 RPGs. Many positive reviews state that this game brought them back to childhood. I disagree. This game just makes me wish I was playing one of the old games I grew up on instead. Evoland 2 does not respect the time of the player. It is padded out and tedious. The references to old games are heavy handed and unfunny. Give this a pass. If you really want nostalgia, just play a good old game.","May 26","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

A statue whose inscription says: “lorem ipsum dolor sit amet”. The most prominent issue I have with Evoland 2 is its inability to take itself seriously. It lingers in a weird limbo of humor and seriousness without fully committing to either. It’s littered with dank memes and clichéd, self-referential jokes which downplay the game's attempts at evoking emotions.\n\nDungeons, upgrades, levels, collectibles, dialogue options and NPCs are all ingredients to a decent RPG adventure but they’re not enough for an excellent one. The progress in Evoland 2 isn’t easily perceptible because the story is a convoluted mess. It sort of keeps moving and throwing twists, most of which overstay their welcome.\n\nI also begun to hope that the NPCs would alter their lines the second time I spoke to them because I found myself repeatedly doing that by accident. The occasional meaningless yes/no choice adds nothing to the script, and there were some cases of continuation errors where my characters were talking about an obstacle they hadn’t yet seen in the game. Then there was the quite literal manic pixie dream girl calling me and my party member a bunch of pessimists, continuing to spout a mass of motivational quotes, which made me skip dialogue until my wrist hurt.\n\nMusic isn’t bad, it’s mediocre. The Haunted Forest area has an uptempo rock tune with a church organ giving it a Castlevania vibe and making it sound like a comedic boss battle. Compared to the music in Zelda, for example, Evoland 2 sounds like a Disneyland ride. Zelda’s Lost Woods tune is more ambiguous in its harmonization. It creates a contemplative ambiance, despite being upbeat.\n\nThe 3D environment simply fails to appeal. The saturated colors and the low-poly props look like they don’t belong on PC. The isometric world doesn’t encourage exploration because you can’t view a single vista in perspective.\n\nMinigames in Evoland 2 are fine, but their framing isn’t. There’s a library with eight small puzzles. In Professor Layton the puzzles pace the gameplay through interesting locales. You’re compelled to investigate and just happen to come by tiny puzzles here and there. In Evoland, I ran from NPC to NPC and solved all eight puzzles in a row for "study credits".\n\nI could say that the main problem is that Evoland 2 is a jack-of-blah-blah and master of blah. While that is true, one of the biggest problems is that it doesn’t induce nostalgia. It falls into the trap of covertly name dropping specific games, without the pleasure of mastery that the referenced games provide.\n\nI play Ocarina of Time annually and I know others who do this. Why? Because I get something out of it every single time. Sometimes I think about Link as the Hero with a Thousand Faces and sometimes of Ganon as the face of good that has been corrupted. But every time I find pleasure in the mastery. It’s subtle, it’s elegant, it’s titillating. Evoland 2 is none of those.","May 6","false","16.2"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

After 30 minutes of trying the game and losing hundreds of gold, I figured the game was cheating. So I looked it up and it was. This is not fun. Not fun. Games are meant to be fun, not waste my time. I have better things to spend 30 minutes on than blindly trying to complete a minigame that is unwinnable without any real feedback that I should move on.","May 8","false","8.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

You started out with a monochrome pixelated game that slowly evolved into something a whole lot better.  Evoland 2 decided to just throw together a whole bunch of random crap and call it a game.\n\nClearly the designers had no idea on how to enhance their first game, so they went for everything. So far I've encountered the low resolution monochrome game play, the 8 bit colour, the 16 bit colour and the modern 3D graphics game play. Those parts aren't too bad, however, instead of just using those features, Shiro Games threw in everything else, possibly including the kitchen sink (I haven't found that yet).\n\nYou now have forced on you, platform gaming, turn based RPG, endless running gaming, street fighter PvP and poorly implemented puzzle solving.  The only type of game I haven't come across yet is FPS, but I'm sure that's coming.  Adding to the unnecessary mix of genres is the tedium of being attacked over and over and over again in some of the levels. It is quite deliberate as a homage to these past genres.  It doesn't sit well in today's gaming style.\n\nAdd to that the convoluted story line, which has as much text to read through as Wikipedia seems to, and I find myself struggling to want to finish the game.\n\nI won't comment on the music, I never listen to game music, I've never enjoyed any game music since the C64 days. If I want to listen to music, I'll play an MP3 or put on a CD.\n\nAre there any positives ?  I like the mix in graphics, I just don't think it's done well this time around. In the first game the changing graphics showed progress, in this game the styles change constantly for what feels like no rhyme or reason.\n\nBottom line ? If you like tedious, repetitive and tedious and repetitive game play then look no further, however if you'd rather play a game that doesn't frustrate the crap out of you, go play something else.  Buy it on special or in a bundle if you must.","May 13","false","42.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

But I was eager to see what Shiro Games would do next, and if they would follow through on the sizable potential of the core idea. The answer with Evoland 2 is...a little yes, a lot no. It's been expanded to a full game, but to what end? The story is barely more memorable than the first one (and the first one hardly even had a story, as best as I can recall), and placed in a framework lifted rather brazenly from Chrono Trigger (as mentioned above). The writing is...iffy, littered with winking referential "jokes" that are only a step or two above "over 9000." The core gameplay is uninspired Zelda-style top-down hack-and-slash. The devs seem to realize this, and so it's padded out with really, REALLY bad minigames. Seriously, I've put about 6 hours into this and have spent at least a third of that being forced to play crappy minigames. Admittedly I haven't finished the game yet so this might change later on, but the game doesn't even really take advantage of the central conceit that drives this whole darn thing. The graphical sophistication changes depending on what era you're in, and that's it. The game barely even comments on it. It can't even muster a feeling of novelty, beyond the non-sequitur genre parody minigames that are as hee-larious as they are fun to play (note: they're not fun to play, and many of them take forEVER to slog through).\n\nIn short, it's a game that doesn't respect the player's time--I'd say it's an idea in search of a game again, but not even the idea seems to really be there anymore.","January 25","false","5.9"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Having played the first one, I thought it would be a natural progression from the first with some fixes to the complaints about the first. And it was, for a short amount of time.\n\nThen you start getting hit by spikes you're nowhere near. Okay, fair enough, maybe I actually *was* barely touching the spike that instakilled me. At least the checkpoints are generous.\n\nThen you get thrust into an unskippable fighting game scenario where the game doesn't tell you the controls, just what street fighter combos they decided to toss in, but the enemy you face can combo you for 75% of your health from the milisecond it gives you control of your character. Maybe I just don't know how to play fighting games and there's some weird trick to break out of combos they didn't mention were in the game.\n\nThen you get forced into an auto scrolling rooftop run where the enemy will keep throwing energy attacks at you, each dealing more than half your health. Get hit more than once? Start over. Didn't break a box in enough time? Start over. Mash the jump button 100 times but still run off the edge? Start over.\n\nThen you get put into a megaman style boss with an assload of health that rarely stops moving and does more than half your health per hit again. A mix of running in melee and throwing balls at you, at the default difficulty the balls are at a height such that you need to jump, but one more is just above you to hit you if you jump, and by the time you land the enemy is running or jumping at you, and you go from full to dead in a moment.\n\nI won't say I'm great at videogames, but I don't consider myself the worst either. The first game took you through different types of RPGs from NES games to Playstation games. This one is a bit different in that it goes through different genres of videogames like shmups and fighting games, but rather than do one thing well, it does a bunch of things pretty poorly. It's one thing to have a difficult section or a ramp up, it's another to force the player to mash through dialogue before a fight just to have your character being attacked immediately when they die in 2 hits. It was fun at first, but you can save yourself some money by looking at screenshots or a handful of videos as it goes through each stage.","January 14","false","9.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

I enjoyed the game to start, but at about 10 hours in, I think I'm ready to set down the controller and let this one go unfinished.\n\nFor myself, Evoland 2 just does not have the depth to hold up to the increased campaign time of ~20 hours.  The base RPG mechanics are fun, but not twenty-hours-fun.  This is a game at odds with itself -- the same things that made the first game great (and made the start of this one just as fun) are what were wearing thin for me as the game went on.  For a handful of hours, the simplistic mechanics are great -- but when you feel like you're on your 50th short fetch quest, that simplicity begins to grate at you.  And while I love some of the altered game modes, it was a Rayman boss-esque auto scrolling chase sequence that made me quit.  The side scrolling platform action sections?  Decent enough! The fighting game boss fight with the prophet?  Silly but fun.  The Shump section?  Dragged on to long, but not terrible.  But the boss runner -- no thank you.\n\nI really hate giving a game with this much heart a thumbs down, but it's hard to recommend a game that, 5 months later, I just have no desire to finish.  Rather than take what Evoland did and do it better, I feel Evoland 2 just does more things -- but doesn't really do any of them very well.","January 22","false","10.9"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

I felt thoroughly disappointed and bored halfway through the game.  If you were to rename the game, it could possibly hold up on its own, but as it stands, it ignores the very core concept that made the original Evoland such a wonderful discovery of a game.","December 29, 2015","false","16.5"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

This game just outright failed in that aspect. I liked the idea of the first game constantly improving the visuals and mechanics as you played. Here they just make you time travel back and forth from some horrible pizel art to some bland generic 3d models that belong on a DS. There's constantly memes and references thrown at you left and right so if you enjoy that this is worth your money. It's just not really what I expected or wanted, in retrospect I wish I had played it sooner after buying so I could refund it.\n\nCombat is boring for most of the game time, puzzles are pretty simple and often border on monotonous, humor has a small selection of good jokes and lots of unfunny ones.

Besides the odd graphical shifts *every few flipping hours* of gameplay, this is nothing even remotely like the original, and contains very few of the unique mechanics of the original.\n\nIt is essentially an EXTREMELY LINEAR 2D, story-driven RPG. That's about all there is to say really. You can easily miss half of the chests be going through "points of no return" that you couldn't possible predict as well (due to "story flags" preventing backtracking).\n\nUh, and the pop cuture parody references to other games of the eras it depicts are laided on so thickly they aren't even the least bit funny. I mean, there's even a stealth section where you hide under a cardboard box FFS.\n\nSo no - I do not recommend this game. If you were looking for something similar to Evoland, look elsewhere.

There are a handful of fun-to-play parts, but the majority of the game is either tedious, mind-numbingly easy filler or unreasonably difficult. I respect a challenge, and am trying to 100% the game still. However, even with all the best armor and weapon, there are parts (like the flying challenge) that make me want to scream. I am wearing full Orikon armor and a beetle can kill me in 3 to 4 hits. Maybe the developers should have realized that you can't make a good game just by making it quirky and nostalgic. Either make a tough game that is back-to-back action; difficult, yet satisfying. Not once have I felt satisfied after finishing a challenge. I don't feek accomplished playing this game.

It pulls together all of these various genres and creates this magnificent patchwork of their gameplay. You'll move from rpg to stealth to turn-based combat to puzzles to so on and so on. The gameplay is solid, with minor flaws here and there that don't affect the actual game it's self. Really I had to go into the options to find these flaws, and even then they're nothing to detrimental to the experience.","August 25, 2015","true","26.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StellerWhite/recommended/359310/","StellerWhite","Podunkle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StellerWhite/","219 products in account","Have you ever seen a tag line read "a loveletter to the glory days of gaming" or something like that? Usually for a kickstarted indie game with pixel graphics and bleepity bloopity music? Well the first Evoland tried to pull that off, but failed because it focused more on its references and in-jokes than actual gameplay features. Well Shiro is back to right their wrongs, and actually make a game instead of an interactive "Get it?" simulator. And for the most part they do.\n\nThe original Evoland had some pretty good ideas behind it, most notably using the evolution of video games (say, from 8 bit to 16 bit) to progress, but Shiro didn't expand on it at all, and the game was mostly references which we've all seen before. Evoland 2 however took the better approach, and built a story and a game to play with the references, instead of having them drive the story and game. It kinda does this Abobo's Big Adventure (which if you haven't played that, google that ♥♥♥♥) thing where it divides itself into different genres and gameplay styles, like shmups and Chrono Trigger for example. Chrono Trigger actually seems to be a pretty heavy influence on the game, what with the time travel and red-haired protagonist. Speaking of, the time travel is one thing the game actually does quite well. Instead of doing the CT thing and letting you choose different time periods, the game's time travel is scripted and advances the story, which I think I prefer. Of course it makes the game so much more linear, and there's little to no exploration to do.\n\nIn conclusion, once again i find myself dissapointed in this game, because instead of expanding on previous ideas, it tries to fix what wasn't broken and changes what made Evoland interesting. That said, it is certainly a far surrperior game to the original, and for fans of references that not everyone is going to get, the game is easy to recommend. What Evoland did wrong, this game does right, but at the same time the opposite is also true. I say pick it up durring a sale or if trading cards are ever implemented.","August 26, 2015","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you call yourself a gamer, you can easily feel the heart that went into this game with all its easter eggs (which there are so many of that you'd be forgiven for thinking the easter bunny came and 30 pounds of taco bell with the game developers).\n\nStory's great, there's at least twice as much content as the original Evoland. Keep in mind though: THIS IS NOT EVOLAND. Evoland 2 is a different approach to the same format, often letting the gameplay itself reference other games while the narrative speaks for itself through exploration.\n\nGameplay is solid through and through, I've encountered bugs that I'm sure will be patched in like a week and are in no way game breaking. There are times where it is really frustrating though, such as the Cherry/Plum Boss Fights or the Wikings Bejeweled Minigame. Also the Card Game is hard af.\n\nHonestly buy this game, as well as the original. If you're a True Gamer when you buy it, this game will be 500% better, with entire segments that just make you wanna say "Oh My God I Love This".\n\n\ntl;dr Remember that Segment in Bayonetta 2 where if you bought and used the Fox McCloud Skin, you could play Star Fox in Bayonetta on the Final Level?

Their are many different mechanics in the game most of them i greatly enjoyed but even the one or two i didnt care for its only a relative short section of the game and was still cool to have different mechanics. The only way i would recomend you not buy this game is if you hate zelda style RPGs cuz although their are many different styles in this game that and a 2d platform (Think Zelda 2/ castlevania) are the majority of the combat and exploration you will play through.

This was on luck only and no skill was involved in this fight. Without any potions on this part, the game would have been rendered unbeatable for me.\n- the trading card game is not very good. You have to fight people in a specific order to obtain new cards which will then make you more powerful and able to beat higher ranked opponents. Again, no skill required, just get the better cards.\n- pathfinding can be a little bit frustrating, as its possible to travel through time, adding more paths to go to and lose yourself on the map and timeperiod. But it was never too bad on my run.\n- you can power up certain characters ingame and get new abilities, but its too bad you have to find hidden items to get these. I didnt get to see all the flashy superpowers.\n\nThe game stands tall as one of the greatest RPGs in modern history. I loved every aspect of the game and hope for another installement in this franchise.

Players will be forced to enter different genres. Not a huge deal for those who are used to them, but this can cause players no familiar with those genres to get stuck.\n\nDon't come into this for the story. I know I probably shouldn't have to say that after the first title, but it's equally true here. If the way Mass Effect 3 ended ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off, you'll need to brace yourself with this one. A nonsensical ending to the story, which doesn't even wrap things up in every area. Unfortunantly I can't think of how I would elaborate on that without it being a spoiler, so I'll just leave it there. Just know that there are loose threads. It feels like they were nearing completion, got impatient, and just winged it on the ending. The game wasn't amazing by any stretch of the imagination, but it was satisfiying until the patch work at the end.\n\nIt appears some items are missable. Even with the dragon radar I can see exactly where certain items are, yet have absolutely no way of accessing them. And yes, I am familiar with the way that game sometimes uses intangible walls to create paths, I still can't reach certain chests.\n\nThe card game is inferior to the original, and still commits the deadly CCG sin of not allowing players to make their own deck. You'll cringe as you win cards whose ONLY use it to discard for points knowing that you'll wind up drawing them later. Won a card with zero attack? Enjoy drawing that rather than something useful. Not only does the AI get to use decks using only good cards while you're forced to use the weakest ones, sometimes the game even starts with the AI having up to twice as much health. While there are of course strategies you can use to mitigate risks, it ultimately relies on luck far more than any decent CCG should.\n\nThe game does get a bit confusing towards the end. You're told to go find 5 pieces of something, and you're given a hit to where each peice is. The problem is....that you might assume like I did that they were all valid choices to decide which one to go for first. In actuality, certain pieces have to be obtained for others, you so might waste hours looking for pieces which can't be obtained yet as I did. I think it would've worked better if the game told you which pieces to get in order.\n\nI reccomend it because it is still an impressive feat. It is hard enough getting one set of mechanics to work when designing and programming. These guys had to make several sets of mechanics work, and aside from the bad design of the card game, they really pull it off. An enjoyable adventure which will eat up about 20-25 hours of your time if you 100% it. Don't expect game of the year material, but if you've got a weekend to burn then it's a quite enjoyable experience.","September 20, 2015","true","33.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You've probably played it all before, but it's all done well. it's hard not to like.\n\nA con is that the dialogue isn't as witty as it thinks it is when it tries to break the 4th wall.\n\nPerformance wise, by the time you're far enough into the game to go full 3D you have no idea whether or not your computer can handle it.

It appears to be an issue on both my computers, perhaps an issue with my aging hardware.","November 23, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While Evoland 1 was more of a fun gimmick with little story, the sequel stays within the gimmick of progressing through the history of changes in JRPGs and builds it into a fully fleshed out game. The gameplay is done very well, even with pulling from all of the vast archetypes of games over the last 30 years, it manages to not get too bogged down in trying to implement too many features. Definitely worth a pickup for any JRPG fans.","November 17, 2015","true","29.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What the first one lacked, the second has in spades. From a rather addicting card game, to the classic secret star search this game has it all. The only downsides I found were in a couple rather difficult game mechanics, such as the bejeweled wiking fights (may I never play that part again in my life) and the street fighter pirate battles.\n\nThe game doesn't disappoint when it comes to the blend of RPG elements throughout the ages. From side scrollers and tactics to 3d dungeon crawling and more. The story is also leagues above the original, and rather touching in many places.

I was extremely pleased to find that Evoland 2 takes concepts from the first game and refines them, and adds one of the better stories I've seen in any game for a long time. I beat the game with 95% completion in about 24 hours of play time.\n\nThe game is an action/adventure/RPG game along the lines of Zelda (except you gain levels and HP), but throughout the game are homages to a surprisinly wide variety of genres, such as Bomberman, Street Fighter, Bejeweled, vertical scrolling arcade shooters, Chrono Trigger styled turn-based RPGs, DDR/Beatmania, Metal Gear Solid, Fire Emblem, Mega Man, side-scrolling shooters, platformers like Mario Bros, and even cameos of Pong, Snake, Space Invaders, and Pac Man. There are some challenging but clever puzzles throughout the game.\n\nThe music is good, with a few great/memorable tracks, but you will hear the same tunes repeated and re-used throughout the game. Not a problem at all for me since I enjoyed them, but I could see that being a low point for others.\n\nThe plot is definitely a strong point in the game. While it is fairly predictable for the most part, there are a few twists to keep it interesting. Overall, I found myself really enjoying and wanting to proceed with the game just to find out what would happen next, something that an RPG hasn't done for me in forever.\n\nThis game easily ranks as one of the best jRPGs I've played. It's at least as good as any classic SNES title.","January 1","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Easter eggs and video games references are everywhere. One of those that put a smile on my face was a hidden puzzle referencing the Konami code.\n\nBut make no mistake, unlike its predecessor, Evoland, Evoland II is not just a short trip trough video game memory lane. It is  a fully fledge RPG with a coherent (tough small) world and a mind bending storyline that has fans debating interpretation on reddit to this day.\n\nWhen it comes to value for money however, I would recommand waiting for a sale. 20$ is a bit too much for my taste, so I bought it half-priced. No regret, this game was a very good time. And now that I've completed it I am considering purchassing the soundtrack to support the developpers.\n\nIf one day Evoland III becomes a thing, I will gladly purchase it full price.","May 11","true","33.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's the kind of game I want to like and reccomend.  The quality is excellent.  It feels like a Nintendo 3ds title, but with higher resolution (once the time period allows 3d graphics).  On the easiest setting, the game is mildly punishing but not too bad.  I had to level up in order to pass one part which I didn't expect to need to do.  The puzzles can be time consuming, and there are a good deal of non-combat tasks that can be frustrating and seem to take forever.  It is also easy to get lost at times, and there is no map or minimap to mitigate this.\n\n7/10, conditionally.\n\nYou have to enjoy a game that takes a lot of time to play, moreso than the moderate combat difficulty would seem to suggest.  I used to like this kind of game when I was a kid in the 80s and 90s but that was because games were expensive and I didn't have endless supplies of money.  Games are cheaper and more plentiful now, so I don't want a game that punishes me or that I get lost when playing in order to last me longer.  Personally, I'm done playing it now, it just takes too much work...that feels like work to play.

The seconds one goes away abit from this and mainly goes from 2D 32-bit, to 2D 16-bit (has to do with the story, which it actually now has one) and to 3D (+ 2.5D later on). Instead, this iteration explores the different styles of games (top-down RPG, 2D platformer, Fighter). It makes for a nice variation of gameplay and style, something the first one was abit lacking of.\n\nNow, for the trouble of this game being unplayable when getting to the 3D section which I've seen some people having trouble with, I finally found a fix (if you have 64-bit Windows atleast).\nGo to 'C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash' and find the file 'mms.cfg'. In it, put these two settings:\n\nDisableHardwareAcceleration=0\nEnableHardwareAcceleration=1\n\nIf that doesn't work, try first reversing the '0' and '1', start the game, get to the laggy part, close the game and set the settings back to what I've written. Hopefully that helps!","September 16, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some reviews say that the non-rpg elements are too hard, but playing the regular difficulty level, I've found it challenging at some points but forgiving (I've found that the harder it is, the more save points there are). I'll also point out that my awesome 2D scroller skills have disapeared in the ~20 years since I've last used them.\n\nThe base game of Evoland 2 reminded me very much of Dragon Warrior (Dragon Quest), one of my favorite game as a child. I guess it's not that hard to emulate the graphics, but I was amazed at how the dialogues from the useless NPCs were in line with how it used to be. I absolutely LOVED the variety in gameplay. That mix of elements is something that I've been wishing for for a long time, without thinking I'd ever see it realize.\n\nAfter completing the game I rushed here to buy it and encourage everyone that tries a lot of games to do the same thing: I've seen too many great indie developpers go broke through the years. I will at least do another playthrough to try and beat my completion percentage (currently 86%).","September 17, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Players will be forced to enter different genres. Not a huge deal for those who are used to them, but this can cause players no familiar with those genres to get stuck.\n\nDon't come into this for the story. I know I probably shouldn't have to say that after the first title, but it's equally true here. If the way Mass Effect 3 ended ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off, you'll need to brace yourself with this one. A nonsensical ending to the story, which doesn't even wrap things up in every area. Unfortunantly I can't think of how I would elaborate on that without it being a spoiler, so I'll just leave it there. Just know that there are loose threads. It feels like they were nearing completion, got impatient, and just winged it on the ending. The game wasn't amazing by any stretch of the imagination, but it was satisfiying until the patch work at the end.\n\nIt appears some items are missable. Even with the dragon radar I can see exactly where certain items are, yet have absolutely no way of accessing them. And yes, I am familiar with the way that game sometimes uses intangible walls to create paths, I still can't reach certain chests.\n\nThe card game is inferior to the original, and still commits the deadly CCG sin of not allowing players to make their own deck. You'll cringe as you win cards whose ONLY use it to discard for points knowing that you'll wind up drawing them later. Won a card with zero attack? Enjoy drawing that rather than something useful. Not only does the AI get to use decks using only good cards while you're forced to use the weakest ones, sometimes the game even starts with the AI having up to twice as much health. While there are of course strategies you can use to mitigate risks, it ultimately relies on luck far more than any decent CCG should.\n\nThe game does get a bit confusing towards the end. You're told to go find 5 pieces of something, and you're given a hit to where each peice is. The problem is....that you might assume like I did that they were all valid choices to decide which one to go for first. In actuality, certain pieces have to be obtained for others, you so might waste hours looking for pieces which can't be obtained yet as I did. I think it would've worked better if the game told you which pieces to get in order.\n\nI reccomend it because it is still an impressive feat. It is hard enough getting one set of mechanics to work when designing and programming. These guys had to make several sets of mechanics work, and aside from the bad design of the card game, they really pull it off. An enjoyable adventure which will eat up about 20-25 hours of your time if you 100% it. Don't expect game of the year material, but if you've got a weekend to burn then it's a quite enjoyable experience.","September 20, 2015","true","33.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Secrets were easy enough to find. And the gameplay styles were awesome to experience. First we'll have my complaints, then we'll move onto why you should play it.\n\nMy only complaints are that:\n1. Some of the gameplay styles just weren't fun to play.  Didn't really enjoy the Candy Crush part and the Double Dragon part got tedious near the end.\n2. There isn't any meaningful side content. Sure Stars are a great way to show completion, but I felt no incentive to find them all before I completed the game.\n3. Difficulty scaling is off in some parts of the game. You may encounter a really easy boss fight, but the next may be really challenging. Then after that they get easy again.  Could use improvement.\n\nWhy you should play it:\n1. Characters are written in a nice way, if they aren't too important to the story, they aren't too fleshed out, if they are, then we will see some character development.\n2. Story is easy to follow. It's a really nice story to play through with an overall theme that you will learn about, that is inspired by Dark Souls.\n3. Not too difficult and not too easy.\n4. It has a decent length.  It's not too short like the first. Without going for optional upgrades, you could easily sink 12 hours into this game.  That's more than most AAA games can offer today.\n\nTL;DR\nGet Evoland 2, it's worth the money more than the first.","February 15","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved the first one, and as much as I liked the story in this sequel better, my biggest problem with this game is how bloated it is. Almost every section lasts way too long. I loved how focused the last one was, and this one was much larger. Near the end of every so called section (i.e. bullethell, beat-em-up, etc,), I found myself really wanting it to end. By the end of the game, I just wanted to finish it. I wasn't really having too much fun. The first one did that better. It still had the cute references, evolution of gaming styles, time travel, and cliche story. But it was much shorter and more focussed.\n\nEvoland 2's story had clunky exposition and cliches, but that added to the charm of the game. I liked it, but I liked the first one better. It's not bad enough for a "Do not reccomend", but I would only reccomend to someone who loved the first, and wanted more - a lot more.\n\n\n\nAnd Fina is one of the most annoying sidekicks ever.","February 15","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You've probably played it all before, but it's all done well. it's hard not to like.\n\nA con is that the dialogue isn't as witty as it thinks it is when it tries to break the 4th wall.\n\nPerformance wise, by the time you're far enough into the game to go full 3D you have no idea whether or not your computer can handle it.

Evoland 2 is a great game; the best rpg I played in 2015.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nEvoland 2 has a variety-show sort of gameplay.  The "core" combat system in the game is a Secret of Mana-esque combat system where you can summon one of three allies to defeeat enemies or open up new paths in the environment [breaking boulders, clearing vines, freezing water, etc.].\n\nHowever, the game likes to mix things up from time to time by introducing a new combat system for a boss or gameplay segment.  It helps keep the game fresh throughout the 20 hour playthrough.  You'll have segments of gameplay that use the mechanics of Bomberman, Tekken, Shoot'em'up's, and many more.  Personally, I loved the card game a little more than I should have, given how simple it is.\n\nCombat and quirky game mechanics aren't all this game has.  There is a lot of platforming in this game that mix simple platforming mechanics with the game's core combat system.  It also has some very interesting puzzles.  The puzzles are often Legend of Zelda-style block manipulation and activation of switches from afar.  However, once you unlock the ability to manipulate time, the puzzles can be immensely fun and surprisingly difficult.  Even progressing in the plot can be a "thinking with time travel" style puzzle to figure out what you need to do in what timeline to make progress  in the story.\n\nSTORY:\n\nAs mentioned above, this game is about time travel.  The game's story should instantly draw comparisons to Chrono Trigger.  However, the game seems to take a very different stance on time travel than Trigger.  If Trigger is about using time travel to fix everything and build a beautiful future, Evoland 2 is surprisingly sober about the topic.  This game is more an exploration of fate, destiny, and inevitability.  Even though you can travel through time, everything that happens was destined to happen and Evoland 2 successfully tackles the question, "if we could alter time, should we?"\n\nThe story of the game was excellent and it was the most memorable game story I have experienced in a long time.\n\n\nOVERALL:\n\nThis is an amazing game for people interested in time travel, sci-fi, and it successfully blends elements of many genres.  10/10 would play Evoland 3.","November 27, 2015","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Evoland 2 does a great job of poking fun at us the players and these classic games, without it feeling unnatural or forced.I'm finding its difficulties to be accurate.  I picked challenging, and indeed it is challenging.  However, not as challenging as some of the games Evoland 2 is saluting.\n\nThe game keeps the story rolling with mercifully placed saved points, and your ability to level up on the fly will pretty much assure your success.  The various types of puzzles found within this game haven't been annoying or tiresome.  I've found them to be fun to solve, and make sense to solve in relation to what is going on in the story.  The game's dialogue is well written, easy to follow, and necessary to the game play.  The PCs/NPCs are very likeable, and don't chatter on(except for one).\n\nThe card mini game has been entertaining, and particularly because a match is quick to play, the winning is fun, and the acquired cards are well done.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that you can't sprint? Yet?\n\nEvoland's creators have done a great job of capturing the essence and innovations of classic games and woven them into their own game, which is equally as fun.\n\n","December 6, 2015","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, what should have been optional minigames became mandatory segments of the game, such as the rhythum boss fight and the Wiking tournament.  Also, far too many of the enemy attacks were not based on any gleanable patterns, and were almost entirely based on chance.\n\nIn a game of skill, applying RNG is an incredibly stupid thing to do, a terrible design flaw...\n\nFor sections such as the Wiking Tournament.. allow people to skip it. Penalize them a bit, make it cost gold\n\nFor the most part, while I do consider this game otherwise great, until there's a means to skip these ridiculous sidegames, I can't say it's truly GREAT..\n\nThe ONE severe flaw is actually a deal breaker, and unless you are incredibly lucky, as statistically, you will eventually become, You will not be able to beat the wiking boss, and this shouldn't be the case at all.\n\nI finally beat the Snowman after what I can only describe as "Groundhogs day hell" and totalling over 5 hours altogether at that boss alone, so I am editing my review.\n\nBUY this game, it's pretty cool, but exercise caution. MOST OF THE BOSSES are unskippable, unavoidable, and keyboard smashing minigames, many of which there is no actual manner to gain an upper hand, and for which changing the difficulty setting has no impact.\n\nYou've had fair warning, which I was not given. That said.. This games Action/RPG with OPTIONAL minigames is pretty damn cool. Remember Final Fantasy 7s theme park? The Arcade?

One minute, you're playing a hack&slash RPG, and suddenly you're playing a platformer...but as the same character, with the same abilities and stats.

For one the evolving gameplay that both this and the first Evoland provide are just amazing, its like you're playing multiple games in 1 game. Sure some people might find this annoying but I assure you its not. The only 2 cons that I would say are there are the puzzles, and the other being the last boss of the game. So pretty much most of the puzzles will take you like 10 minutes each if you are not use to puzzles in games. The puzzles in zelda have NOTHING on this game. On for the 2nd con, the last boss.... People will agree with me that the last boss is a ♥♥♥♥♥. Its honestly the only reason I have not finished the game.\n\nDon't let these 2 cons deter you though, it really is an amazing game just easy difficulty doesn't feel like easy at all. So I wouldn't suggest going above easy unless you like a good challange.\n\nOverall I give this game a 8/10","December 10, 2015","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lets go over the major points:\n\nGameplay:\n-This is one of the only things relatable to Evoland 1. Only difference is it has A LOT more variety. There are more genres introduced than you would think could fit in a game.\n-The different elements of gameplay are a lot better introduced and more seamlessly fit into the game than Evoland 1.\n-They completely removed the chest mechanic of finding new gameplay types to make it seem like the gameplay changing IS the story (which I will talk about later). Instead they will just surprise you\n-As with the other game, if any section of the game is too hard or boring for you, you can tone down the difficult to greatly speed up the game.\n\nStory:\n-Evoland 2 is a much more story driven game than Evoland 1. If you don't like dialogue in games or don't like story, Evoland 2 might not be for you.\n-The story fits the theme of Evoland 1 (progressing though gameplay and graphics) directly into the world without breaking the 4th wall.  The changing of graphics is given a reason and is a cannon part of the world (I won't spoil any more than that)\n\nMusic:\n-Great soundtrack, although only a slight improvement from Evoland 1\n\nGraphics:\n-Compared to Evoland 1, they are "worse" at the parts their supposed to be bad, and better at the parts where they are supposed to be good.\n\n\nOverall:\n-Evoland 2 is more of a game complete with plot, whereas Evoland 1 was more of an ongoing gimmick.","December 30, 2015","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well Steam is wrong. I have completed the entire game story-wise. (http://imgur.com/kHCnj79). On to the review!\n\nIntro\n====\nThe original Evoland was surprisingly good. Its main focus was on the gameplay and the concept of 'evolving' the game with sound effects, music, graphics and gameplay but the storyline was very simple. Evoland 2 took its predecessor and improved on pretty much everything!\n\nImprovements\n===========\n-Shifting through time (changing graphics) is used lots later in the game and the shift is done very well.\n-There are so many different locations and most contain their own unique gameplay or genre.\nThere's the main gameplay of the Legend of Zelda, 2D platformers, Street Fighter, 1942, Fire\nEmblem and so many others!\n-Each gameplay genre also has its own boss and if you are good at it/enjoy it, they won't last\nfor too long so that you get bored\n-The game has a very deep storyline and will give you more hours of playtime than the first.\n-Leveling up is relevant now! Your stats from leveling up carry through *most of* the different gameplay types.\n-The card game is better if you want to waste time playing it. You find people to battle scattered across the map in\ndifferent times and you unlock more cards from beating other people.\n\nConclusion\n========\nEvoland 2 is a great game that improves on everything from the first Evoland. There are many different gameplay genres, the time travel is improved greatly and if you play through it all the way, it will provide you with much more playtime than the first. It doesn't provide me with many - if any major negative comments at all. Fantastic game!\nEvoland 2: A Slight Case of Space Time Continuum Disorder - Highly Recommended\n\nNote: Be prepared though because if you are bad at a genre that shows up or just don't like it, you have to complete it so if you find it too difficult, the only thing to do is practice, practice, practice.

Tons of variety, a complex overarching story with lovable characters, expanding the original's length to a fantastic pace, and the gameplay is the best of Secret of Mana Zelda and Chrono Trigger combined while making it legitimately funnier than the original. I prefer witty writing and snark over hey! Look here! The Cake is a Lie! LOL The antagonists are also everything that makes a good villain compared to Evoland where the villain is just a more vain Sephiroth with no personality.

It goes from graphics that is pixelated like a Gameboy to 3D like any modern console or PC. The main gimmick of this game is time travel and actually uses the lesser quality graphics as older times.

A vast improvement over the previous installment. The basic premise remains the same: this is the ultimate chimera of a game, mixing all the genres and volumes you can possibly think of, within the grand frame of a JRPG. However, while the predecessor was more focused on simulating the gradual improvement of gaming and graphics technology over time, this one is no longer merely just a homage to the technological development of the video game field. Evoland 2 is a proper game in and of itself - perhaps even two or three games in one.\n\nI'd finished Evoland 1 in about 8 hours, and I jumped into this one expecting much of the same, but I ended up spending over 40 hours getting up to 100% completion. (Though, considering how much of a perfectionist I am, you will most likely take a far shorter time in finishing the game.) The game's got good volume, and it stays fresh all the way through, thanks to all the different genres the developers managed to implement and squeeze into one game.\n\nI have but a single con I can mention about this game, and it's that the plot leaves something to be desired (after all, that's what tends to happen when you have heavy time travel involved in a story), but it is my firm belief that it's the journey that matters most, not the destination; and the journey has been nothing short of spectacular indeed.\n\n\nNeed I still say more?

A very enjoyable throwback not only to old school Action-RPG but video game history at large, with distiled gameplay snippets from legendary titles, such as Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy Tactics, Chrono Trigger, Galaga, Gradius, Street Fighter II, Double Dragon, and even more recent hits like Hearthstone. Easter eggs and video games references are everywhere. One of those that put a smile on my face was a hidden puzzle referencing the Konami code.\n\nBut make no mistake, unlike its predecessor, Evoland, Evoland II is not just a short trip trough video game memory lane. It is  a fully fledge RPG with a coherent (tough small) world and a mind bending storyline that has fans debating interpretation on reddit to this day.\n\nWhen it comes to value for money however, I would recommand waiting for a sale. 20$ is a bit too much for my taste, so I bought it half-priced. No regret, this game was a very good time. And now that I've completed it I am considering purchassing the soundtrack to support the developpers.\n\nIf one day Evoland III becomes a thing, I will gladly purchase it full price.","May 11","true","33.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are countless subtle references (and many straight-up emulations) of a wide variety of games, and to spoil any of their appearances here would be a shame.\n\nIf you strip all of the nostalgic elements away, and judge the game for its story and gameplay alone, it's still an absolute masterpiece.\n\nThe only gripes I have about the game are the lack of character customization (there is virtually none) and the time-travel plot driver, which is almost point-for-point lifted from Chrono Trigger. And to be fair, those are hardly criticisms at all, as not every game needs to involve 20 minutes on a character creation screen. And Chrono Trigger was incredible, so you really can't blame them for retelling that particular classic tale, with a few new twists.\n\nI find it incredibly hard for a game to capture my attention these days, but this one offered up just the right mix of everything to keep me from tabbing out and browsing Reddit after a few minutes.\n\nSolid 9/10.

There are several of these genres/games that I either don't get or dislike for various gameplay or design reasons, and all of these are unskippable and integral to the game itself. There are no alternative paths; if you come across a section you dislike, you'd better buckle up, go tryhard mode, and beat it, because you can't leave it now. These sections also all vary in quality, from cheap ripoffs of the original games, to well-designed homages. The "Jack of all trades, master of none" saying definitely applies here.\n\nI'm not actually sure what my verdict on this game is. It's pretty good, I guess. Not amazing, but ok. I love me an oldschool fantasy RPG with decent story, and this game definitely hits that mark well. I'd prefer if it were less scattered in execution and was less heavyhanded with the pop culture references, but it was alright. I enjoyed it for what it was. Unfortunately, it's a game stuck in the past so much that I don't think it really realizes what it's not. And it's not an improvement on any of the genres it emulates. Which is a royal shame, because some of the aforementioned game formulas could definitely be improved upon with just a little bit of originality. And there is zero originality to this game. Every single piece of it you'll have seen before.\n\nThis may seem like a negative sort of review, but it really isn't. The controls are tight. The story is good enough (though the twists in the story are often quite obvious). The transitions between game modes make sense and are oftentimes brilliant or seamless. The pixel art, like most pixel art, is passable. The 3D animations are pretty solid. The attention to detail in a lot of areas is fantastic. The music is forgettable or sometimes annoying. The puzzle design is really solid. It's a good game. It's just not a great game. Grab it on sale and enjoy it for what it is. Through all of my gripes, I had a blast, and I'm sure you will too.","May 15","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's solid all on it's own, but if you're a veteran of the genre -- or really any gaming, you'll find it all the more enjoyable, with lots of clever references to everything from Mario, to Guitar Hero, to strategy games, to match-three, to Bomberman, to Lord of the Rings, to Game of Thrones.  It's very funny, never taking itself too seriously -- for example, on purchasing another sword, the game notes that an axe would have been a nice change-up but that the art team didn't have the budget.\n\nThe music is excellent, the art is great (jokes about the budget notwithstanding), and the gameplay is a perfect mix of tight controls, well-executed puzzles, and every RPG fighting convention you can think of (and then some.)  The level design throughout is fantastic and I can't speak highly enough about the excellent puzzles in the last few chapters of the game.  The gimmick -- switching from one time period to another is represented by different graphical styles from early Gameboy, to 8-bit, to 16-bit, to full 3d -- never feels like a gimmick.  It's organic within the confines of the story and is the source of both interesting challenges and lots of humor.\n\nSpeaking of the story, it's intriguing and doesn't end the way you'd expect.  It has some pretty deep philosophical underpinnings, something a bit surprising to find in this type of game.  It's a good length and doesn't overstay its welcome.  There's plenty to collect along the way as well and some (small) recognition for completing the game at various levels of completeness.\n\nIf you like JRPGs or ARPgs, you should play this game.  It's highly recommended.  I can't wait to see what Shiro Games comes up with next.","May 15","true","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game was incredible!\n\nEvoland 2 exceeded the high expectations that I had coming into this game.  I was a big fan of the first Evoland, and was expecting a similar gametype (of "unlocking" game features as you play along).  What I got, however, was a fantastic game that didn't rely heavily on a central gimmick.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nThe Story - The story in EL2 is phenominal.  You aren't held by the hand and force-fed the lore except for crucial game moments.  Without spoiling much, know that there are many plot twists that will keep you guessing and wanting more even up until the final moments of the game.\n\nThe Genres - I won't begin to explain the different levels and concepts.  Partially because it would contain spoilers, but also because the shock value of realizing what is going on is too rich to pass up.\n\nThe Card Game - I'm a sucker for RPG card games, and this is an optional part of the game.  The card game has a "magic the gathering" feel to it, and I would love to play more of it.\n\nHumor - This game is full of witty humor and outlandish situations. At times, a character will say what we are thinking, and you can't help but laugh at the\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\nProgression - Since EL2 has an open map, it is easy to spend countless minutes trying to remember where you are supposed to go and what you are supposed to do.  Later in the game, this became easier when a character gave clues as to five main objectives, but there was a few moments I had to google where I was supposed to go next.\n\nWalking -  I would have loved a "run" feature.  Spending time walking around to get to objectives and hunting down key items\n\nReturning Events - I would also like to replay certain side quests.  There aren't any "missable" items, but missable game features.  Perhaps using a NPC to initiate former mini games and game modes would have been great.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend Evoland 2 to any fan of RPGS, Platforming, or gaming in general.  You will not regret this purchase.\n\n10/10","May 20","true","23.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you played the first game then you get the idea of this game evolving through classic RPG styles.  Yet Evoland 2 goes beyond what the first did.  The larger more in depth story line along with going beyond just RPG game play, but including elements from every classic game style of the early arcade and console generations.  Platforming, side scroll shooter, top base shooter, side scroll beat-up, one on one combat, DDR, tactical and so on.\n\nYou are no longer exploring the evolution of the RPG game.  You are experiencing the all encompassing game world.\n\nYou follow the story and don't know what will come next.  The game style switches fluidly from one to the other.  No game play style feels out of place.  While there are types of games I am not good at *COUGH DDR*.  Each style provides that bit of challenge but is not impossible even if you hate that style.  Don't like mortal combat game play, well it's a part of the game but you can do it.\n\nThere is not enough that can be said about how great this game is.  I don't want to spoil anything.

It was a nostalgic walk through some of the best games like Legend of Zelda & Final Fantasy, and it was very fun & educational about the history of games.\nEvoland 2 is in a whole other category.  This is a long game, it's deep, it's fun, there are secrets and puzzles, and the time travel aspect is SO COOL and SO elegantly constructed.  One minute, you're playing a donkey-kong style platformer, and the next you are in a tactical turn-based battle.  The story is great, and I really loved how big the map was and how many different styles of games were included.\nWhen I play RPG games, I /never/ play the card/dice mini games... But with Evoland 2, (the "game of cards" resembling a much-simplified version of Magic the Gathering), I was OBSESSED with collecting the cards and playing with random characters throughout the universe.\n\nWhile I love this game and would absolutely recommend it to everyone, I would say to play the original Evoland first:  This game is really good, but I think the elements in the original of slowly picking up game engine advancements like music / different bit images / etc as treasures along the way was a really great way of showing how games developed over time.  As a sequel, this game definitely surpasses the first, but I think they should still definitely be played in order.","May 24","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

MY REVIEWS WILL HAVE SPOILERS IN THEM!\nI Gotta say i enjoyed Evoland 2 alot. The base game is a zelda style hack n slash with a huge twist! The graphics change up from 8bit, 16bit and 3D graphics non stop..each one is an actually time traveling back and forth in the game story line! The game play changes up constantly aswell between hack n slash, flying shooters, fighting, card battle,puzzle battle, guitar hero, Final Fantasy 7 style, platformer, Bomberman style,final fantasy Tactic style, side scrolling beat em up, and lots of mini games!\nThe story itself was actually pretty deep, better than i thought a game like this would have for a story! The main character (you) gets shot out of his time zone (old school gameboy graphics) and into other graphic realms where he meets the other 3 characters that will join you through out the game. Humans are trying to rule the world from demons and anything else that is not human pretty much. The humor was funny but kinda degrading to men alot i felt..the female characters acted as all the male characters were pretty dumb! The humor was also kinda rude just all the way around but still got a laugh out of me time to time.\nLots of old school Easter eggs flowing through the whole game, Even game of throne reverences are there!\ngame was overflowing with Nintendo and Final Fantasy Reverences for days!\nAbout 5+ hours in the game becomes very open world. Half way through the game you unlock the ability to time travel anytime you like which was pretty cool!\nthe puzzle battle and beat em up modes were pretty repetitive and annoying..i personally did not enjoy them. The card battle mode was epic and lasted throughout the whole game, there were 60 cards all together and every person you beat would give you a card..the card challengers were placed all around the game for you to find and battle. The fighting game mode was street fighter 100% but sadly lasted less than 10 minutes then never again which also made me sad. The Final Fantasy Tactic style was personally my favorite and i made it last a good 2 hours of the game. You could upgrade the army and do some pretty cool charge attacks!\nI would say the average time it will take to beat this game would be around 20 hours, i beat it in 23 hours with 73% of all collectibles found, 5 more hours and i would of got 100% but i was about done with the game and just wanted to see it finish!\nthe ending of the game is a huge cliffhanger followed by a 3D picture depending on how much you completed the game. 73% got me 3 of the 5 main characters on the beach playing volleyball. all 5 characters would show you a little secret about the ending.\nOverall i liked the game and i would recommend it to people who enjoy a decent adventure game with alot of throwback twists! The first Evoland was fun and for the cellphone but was pretty much a arcade game that changes up..Evoland 2 is beyond better with lots to do and a pretty good story. The game is on sale alot on steam for $5-10 which is great but even the full price at $20 is still worth it\nEvoland 2 gets 7 pixel's out of 10!\nGO PLAY IT!\n\nIf you like this review join us on FACEBOOK at League Of Extraordinary Slackers!","May 29","true","41.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sequel, Evoland 2, took everything thing that was great about the original, improved upon it, expanded on it, and generally took things to 11.\n\nI highly recommend this game --- especially if you liked the original. My only gripe, if you can call it that, is that the game has a bit of a slower start than the previous game. This, however, is understandable when you consider the difference in size and scope.","June 4","true","40.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a wide variety of genres in this game, so sometimes you can get a bit stuck when one comes up that you are not good with.  For me, it was the roof-top runner section, which I had to attempt a lot before finally passing.  The good thing is that there are a lot of checkpoints, so you only have to repeat a small section of material for each attempt.\n\nAnother minor issue is that the plot can get a little bit messed up if you do certain sections out of the expected order.  In one part of the game, there is a blocked path and a hint that you need the help of someone from a nearby dungeon to open the path.  There is nothing stopping you from going to the dungeon before finding the blocked path, which results in your characters asking for help unblocking the path prior to actually learning about the path.  This does not break the game's plot, but it is a bit of poor forsight.\n\nAll in all, this game is a lot better than the original Evoland (which was also a pretty good game).","June 5","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
