The aesthetic and gameplay work really well together for the right feel. I enjoyed the little touches like scan resolution being tied directly to the battery power. The radial scanning view is a neat concept that forces you to tap into that ever shrinking memory system that we as a society have been trying so hard to phase out.\n\nThe limitations of the drone view add to the tension in a good way. The game reminds you that it is important to pay attention instead of just forcing your face into the dirt like these type of games can.\n\nPaying for this game is an investment into a solid game concept that I believe will mature into a great game!","October 11, 2015","true","2.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Well I gave it a shot anyway and, sorry cannot recommend. If there is a demo play it first befoe buying. Really getting tired of these Early Access games and the number that fail to hit the mark. Too bad.","February 14","false","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I personally think in later versions there should be some form of randomness involved and my dynamic enemies.","March 3","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the early access (demo) is short, it gives a clear instruction about how to play this game. Clone keys, gain access to open gates, find evidence, enter the code. Then the demo ends. Easy, right?","March 24","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
