Fans of the genre will find a lot of novelty here, as the game takes some creative risks you don't see very often.  Unexpected themes include oddly-child-friendly  casual nudity, existential/societal angst, meaningful playing at dress-up, and amateur planetary exodus.\n\nThis sounds like nonsense, and it is, but it all comes together into a package that works surprisingly well.\n\nIf you don't agree, at least there will be plenty of marshmallows.  Go for it!\n","February 9","true","11.5"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","38","48","4","0"
