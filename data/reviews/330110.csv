How cliche.. but FUN!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaC531nSO3w\nEquipped with a basic pistol you slowly work through the levels collecting loot for purchasing and upgrading of weapons along with boosting base attribute points. Weapons included a range of pistols, rifles and shotguns that all had procedurally generated stats. Levels are generally segmented into arenas, clearing each area reopened invisible barriers allowing further progression until eventually facing mini-boss fights. Each boss used alternate weapons, attack patterns and insults.\n\nComedy wise it's quite good, bit of a shame there was no voice-work. With a decent little story it really would have added to the overall immersion but the soundtrack and artstyle are very spaghetti western and do a wonderful job on their own. Control wise both kb+mouse and gamepad was suitable and responsive, while all the keyboard controls were able to be remapped\n\nWith co-op support, decent price point and tight twin-stick western shooter action, can easily give Wild Frontera the big thumbs up. Did not have a chance to try co-op but I'm sure that would only be more enjoyable. Cheers folks. :)","April 26, 2015","true","3.7"," 39 of 54 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","39","54","2","1"

While it's a little on the short side and could benefit from some voice acting, fans of top-down shooters and games with a Wild West setting are in for a treat.","April 22, 2015","true","4.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

I DARE you to play the only F'ing "twin stick shooter" that I had to change from gamepad to mouse and keyboard. Impossible with the gamepad. This is no twin stick shooter by any traditional means.\n\nThey want you to be so deadly accurate with the aiming. Bullets will zip by enemies with less than a millimeter between them but if there is a trap on the ground, better be a mile away from the thing or you're dead. Guy throws a bomb and you're just outside the circle of damage? Dead. Devs, at least be consistant with the BS.\n\nBombs: few and far between, if some bs happens like your guys gun seems to jam 50 times in a row or you just happened to be within a mile of a trap, you just lost them all and they will not reappear. Doenst really matter, they dont do much damage. You only get three at a time and never go where you want them to anyways.\n\nI quit this game after I finally saved enough money (game is very stingy with money) and bought a good revolver. Next shop, I go to click exit and just happened to hit the wrong button and bought the worst gun in the game. No buy backs, no getting back the gun I worked hard to save for. Yeah, I suppose I should have been paying attention to where I was clicking, but anyone (and im sure im not the only one) could make that mistake with the half- ♥♥♥♥♥ design.\n\nBottom line: I've certainly played worse, but to say this is a twin stick shooter combined with poor level design gets a thumbs down for me. Other thumb is up my butt.","February 29","false","5.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","15","18","3","3"

I liked the graphic style and it was close to being good, but it failed on a few fronts. Finished the game in 2 hours, and it spent most of that 2 hours annoying me.\n\n- Most deaths feel due to bad design rather than something I should have seen\n- No pause function\n- The night levels have really low contrast, so you can't see anything\n- Took me 5 stages to realise there was a dodge button\n- The guns feel sluggish\n- Confined spaces make it hard to avoid getting cornered\n- Frequently killed by things I couldn't see","September 28, 2015","false","1.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","1"

It has good audio and visuals, some good arena fights, and a decent array of weapons to keep things interesting. Unfortunatelythe loose gamepad controls that turn it from challenging to frustrating, and generally ruin an otherwise good game. Using the mouse and keyboard make the controls much tighter, but my I prefer using twin sticks to control a twin stick shooter.\n\nMaybe a couple updates will fix the issues I have with it, but until then I can't really recommend it unless you prefer the mouse/keyboard controls for this type of game.\n\nEdit: clarifying the control issues are with gamepads, not keyboard/mouse.","June 21, 2015","false","2.0"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","25","41","0","3"

The fluidity and responsiveness of the game seems to be lacking that of the top-notch twin stick shooter games, and it gives the game an overall little bit of sluggish feel that brings down my over-all first impressions score from what I feel it "could" have been with just a little more work.\n\nI like that up to 4 players can play online co-op, but I think i was the first one to buy and play this game so that aspect wasn't able to be tested at the time of this early review.\n\nThe game is challenging early on, and a lot of fun, and the controls aren't horrible by any stretch, they are pretty good, but certainly not nearly as crisp and responsive as I like to see twin stick shooters like this.\n\nWith the developers stating about a 2.5 hour expected play through, and then having to wait for additional content and game modes or playing the game again at an 'extreme" difficulty level, it's hard for me to see a ton of value in this game even at the low initial price point of $9.99 USD.\n\nStill, I believe the game is pretty fun, with pretty good (just not great) controls, and it does offer an eye-catching western beauty style that I enjoy myself.  It it certainly good enough to make me wish it was just a little bit better.\n\nMy overall first impressions review based on Stage 1 play solo play...  72% (out of 100)","April 21, 2015","true","0.9"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","21","37","2","1"
