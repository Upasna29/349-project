It's a classic for a reason.\n\nPac-Man Museum may be a better deal, especially for the never released on PC elsewhere Pac-Man Championship Edition (Not DX), but that game is locked to some ridiculous resolution settings. This will run just fine in a window with no complaints. Ms. Pac-Man as well is probably a better product too, but, hey, this does what you expect it to do.","April 19","true","0.1"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","18","26","3","0"

The yellow ball with an eating disorder is back again, and is already beloved by many even on this very day. Obviously this is a straight port from the arcade to Steam. But I'm not complaining. It's still addicting as heck. Who could not enjoy gobbling up Pac-Dots, Fruits, and the main course, the Ghosts.\n\nEven if you're not born from the 80's, you can discover the true origins of how Pac-Man became a classic hit just by playing the game.","April 26","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Lag and random unresponsiveness plagues this game, much like Ms Pacman.  I found myself wondering why it's going left when I pushed up on the joystick.  Or why it does nothing at all at times.\n\nGreat for nostalgia and the game looks great.  Seems to play much like the original.  Just needs work on controller / input.  It feels more like playing an 80s arcade booth with a broken stick.  Do they not test these with any real game play before release?","April 24","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsKool/recommended/394160/","ItsKool","KoolWranch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsKool/","102 products in account","Pac-Man was originally supposed to be called "Puck-Man" but was changed to Pac-Man after the developers found out how easy it was to be changed to F***-Man in every English country.\n\nREAL REVIEW\nIt's the exact 1980s classic.... on PC.\n\nBefore I played this, I was expecting a horrid PC port that was just a laggy emulation of the game. After playing a few games of it, I came to a conclusion that the port was not perfect, but was passable. The game is emulated almost perfectly. The only thing I noticed is that every once and awhile Pac-Man seems to get stuck sometimes when he turns. I don't remember if that was supposed to be part of the game or some glitch (If it isn't this part will be removed), but it can be prevented by turning just at the right moment or if you do get stuck press any arrow key to get moving again. The last imperfection of this port is that the game has no mouse support and to exit the game you must click the red "x" on the top of the game's window (or Alt-F4 if you prefer).\n\nThe last few things you should know about this game is that it has Steam achievements and leaderboards, that is what separates this version from all the rest other than the fact that it's the only way to own the original Pac-Man game on PC offically (excluding the Pac-Man collection, that port was much worse that this).\n\nHopefully my review was of some help, thanks for reading.\n","May 8","true","0.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

From the sounds to the textures, the difference between the arcade version and this one are nearly seamless. If you have been searching for a version of this game like i have, than you are in luck. The only negatives i could find are the unintuitive menus. All in all this is a near perfect adaptation of this retro masterpiece of a game. KILLZONE Gives this game a 8/10. Highly recommended.","April 24","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some very basic functions have been missed and basic input support has not been offered. Unless these aren't fixed quickly, then I would suggest avoiding these or getting a refund if you have already purchased them.","April 27","false","9.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I;ve easily played a hundred hours of other ports over the last few years.\n\nI can't recommend this port.
