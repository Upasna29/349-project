"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/288930/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","I think trying to view The Charnel House Trilogy as, well, a trilogy, is what made it the most difficult to fully comprehend. Though it’s split into three acts, each piece of The Charnel House is neither its own self-contained experience, nor a strictly sequential collection of three distinct stories. Each act may feature the same characters to tie them together, but it’s the subtle thematic elements that ultimately connect them meaningfully, requiring each part exist on its own so as to allow a better appreciation of the whole.\n\nEverything begins with “Inhale”, the first and weakest episode but the one which serves to divert your expectations of what The Charnel House is before moving on to the main course. It’s the shortest episode and the one most grounded in reality. Alex Davenport is preparing to leave her apartment after a nasty breakup has left her life in a rather unpleasant place, too connected to her current residence to allow her to stay there any longer.\n\n“Inhale” feels important because its tone is so drastically different from the acts which follow. There’s a lot of references to video games and gaming culture, at times being a little too self indulgent and making it hard to buy into Alex’s character when she’s constantly cracking jokes that tend to fall flat. This isn’t what The Charnel House is though, and why I feel it doesn’t largely detract from what follows. We’re introduced to the lead characters in a way that’s a little eerily unnatural. It gives the impression something is off about all of this without ever actually showing it, which left me unprepared for the horrific turn the next two acts would take.\n\n“Sepulchre”, which was actually originally released on its own years ago, takes us away from Alex for some time to introduce us to Doctor Harold Lang and possibly the most important character in the game: the train our characters find themselves mutually travelling on. It’s an inexplicably empty locomotive for what is ostensibly a regularly used passenger train, and those who are present seem all too calm and deflective when asked where exactly the other passengers are.\n\n“Sepulchre” is horror that is constantly trying to reassure you and tell you it’s not. Character interactions become odder and odder, hinting at histories neither you nor your character fully understands, as they continue to try to believe it’s all a bizarre dream. The act got under my skin the more time I spent trying to make sense of it all. Very little is ever shown, but it’s what’s included, and how increasingly distressing that becomes which truly terrifies. It’s probably the only episode which could effectively be taken on its own, but in the greater context of The Charnel House it acts better as a foreshadowing of what’s to come.\n\nThe final act, “Exhale”, is when the pieces are aligned and The Charnel House stops playing with supernatural horrors in exchange for the far more alarming terrors of reality. We meet Alex again, now on the same train as Lang, but in a wholly different environment of her own making. “Exhale” is more terrifying than either previous episode, and it’s do to its horror being a product of the world we live in.\n\nThe monsters here aren’t demonic abominations, but twisted, disturbing people whose delusions are unsettlingly real. The Charnel House never presumes to be more clever than it is, but that only makes the plain evil and panic expressed by its characters that much more affecting. It struck a nerve with me the way no paranormal entity could, each line feeling like a raw plea for help when nobody is listening.\n\nIndeed it’s how relaxed everyone but Alex stays that hit home the most, mirroring the dismissive ignorance so often shown by people when someone tries to tell them something horrible is happening. Empty condolences are made, blind eyes are turned, and it’s not until Alex’s life is threatened that anyone seems to understand exactly the extent of what is happening. It’s a kind of intensely grounded psychological horror that I find most chilling, because it’s something you don’t want to believe is real even though you know it could be.\n\nI didn’t know what The Charnel House Trilogy was going to be when I started it up. I assumed it would be narrative focused, perhaps in a traditional adventure game format, with a cast of familiar (and surprisingly competent) voice actors. What I got was a somewhat uneven, but ultimately remarkable horror story that seems to be only starting. Part of me is saddened by the current lack of resolution to many of the arcs began here, but more than that I’m excited with where this could go from here, having surprised me as much as it did.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","April 20, 2015","true","2.3"," 45 of 48 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","45","48","0","0"

Wasn't this an astonishing experience? When I decided to give this one a go, I wasn't expecting neither that much spiritual depth, nor such qualitative narrative. The Charnel House Trilogy - one game with separate acts, actually - is an incredibly well arranged psychological horror adventure.\n\nI'd try to give you the baseline for the story, but the events, the characters that they are surrounding and their in-depth meanings are completely dependent on a perspective, and it is near impossible to define any character that we encounter within the game without pure speculation. Charnel House is what you get from Charnel House. Thus, I'll only present you some facts.\n\nYou begin the game as playing Alex Davenport, a young woman who is trying to recover from a bad break up. For some reason, she decides to go on a long train journey, in hopes of reaching the Island of Augur Peak at the end. During this odd journey, she encounters an odd British gentleman, Dr. Harold Lang, who is the curator of a museum and visiting the same island for an archeological expedition. The only seeming bond between them, is their lonely destination, and a series of uncanny encounters they shall endure during their journey.\n\nThe Charnel House Trilogy consists of three separate acts, as if taken from carefully planned scenes from a theatrical performance: Inhale, Sepulchre and Exhale. Inhale is tied to reality, with a bitter taste of past experience. It feels old, dysfunctional and hurt. Sepulchre is the sublime passage between the real and that shadow on the corner of your eye, descending into the very Heart of Darkness, the horror itself. Exhale is the triumphant delusion, breaking the barrier between the reality that we coddle ourselves with and the cruel fact that logic doesn't work anymore. It is weaved with pure manifestation of raw emotions, raising more questions than it answers.\n\nThree acts come together to compose an elaborate setting of carefully chosen subliminal details. The story is full of literary references, thrilling anecdotes, grave yet elegant symbolisms and interrelated details that will give a shiver down your spine when you realize their relevance. Don't expect your common jump horror. The art of absurd is the game's primary weapon against your psyche. This is a great psychological thriller.\n\nThe gameplay is no different than your casual adventure. There are some very minor puzzles, but nothing that would hinder your progress. As long as you keep exploring, the story reveals itself. Graphics are nothing extraordinary, nearly same as Blackwell series themselves, familiar and simple. Encountering something this eerie in this basic environment is probably down right uncanny compared to facing a grotesque enemy in full HD. When you finish the game, you cannot keep yourself from repeating exchanged dialogues in your head, trying to decipher hidden meanings.\n\nIf you've come to like the game, I'll suggest reading Ashton Raze's - the writer of The Charnel House Trilogy - Bright Lights and Glass Houses, which is a novel that reveals some more information about the game's characters. I also recommend playing the game twice for the patient, just to watch events unfold in day light. I'll be anticipating the sequel until it comes in 2016!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 23, 2015","true","9.2"," 52 of 59 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","52","59","2","7"

In Inhale we play as Alex Davenport and we try to find our ticket for a train heading to Auger Peak.  In Sepulchre we play as Doctor Lang, a man also heading to the same island and with him we explore the train and then in Exhale we again play as Alex who also has to explore the mysterious train.\n\nThe Charnel House is a weird title and I will try to explain it the best I can. The game is more or less story driven, so don't expect that many puzzles and when you do get a puzzle now and then, they are so simple to solve you shouldn't even break a sweat.  I wish the puzzles were a  bit more complex are had some layer of difficulty, but I found myself breezing through the entire game without even having to stop and think on what I'm supposed to do.\n\nThe graphics are great and shows that if you want to make a great pixel adventure game, the adventure game engine is the way to do it.\n\nThe soundtrack is also really good, It helps build mood and tension and also brings out atmosphere in some of the darker moments in the game.\n\nThe voice acting is also really good. Everyone does a great job including Jim ♥♥♥♥ing sterling son who portrays his character in a very creepy manor. If Jim is reading this (which of course he isn't) he should do more voice work in the future.\n\nThe game however has a few negatives.\n\nThe story has a very rough start. The first chapter is so slow I thought to myself that this game will bore me to death and I've heard so much good stuff about it. But once the ♥♥♥♥ starts hitting the fan it get's really good, not to mention the final bit is really disturbing in it's own way.\n\nThe puzzles as mentioned previously are way too easy and I wish they could have come up with a better way to do them, but even then some of the puzzles are very fun to do.\n\nThe game is not filled with jumpscares, so if you're wondering about that you don't have to worry, you are safe from jumpscares, but you're not safe from disturbing voice acting by Jim Sterling and disturbing material.\n\nOverall I can safely say The Charnel House Trilogy is a great game and definitely worth your time. The game is spooky good time and if you like adventure games or horror in general I highly recommend picking this gem up.\n\nFinal Rating:\n8.5/10 - Great\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 9","true","4.6"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","34","35","0","2"

Point-and-click part is very easy and, with story being linear, it is basically 'use that on that in an obvious way'. Disturbing mood is nice and some situations are sincerely unnerving (but I'm scared easily). VA is ok, some voices are more ok than others, some are less; maybe people need more practice. Visuals are acceptable. Music is good for each situation: no blazing trumpets on suspence scenes.\n\nThe word 'trilogy' in a name of the game may give an impression that there are three games, but in fact there are just three scenes/episodes, first of which is very short.\n\nBut I can't say I didn't enjoy the game. Could really go without video-games references in 'Inhale', though.  And with less cliffhanger at the end. While Alex story kind of ended up soundly, Kat's story and Lang's story (and writer's story and maybe Gloria's story) are all unresolved.\n\nDon't regret buying it and hoping for continuation(s), but it might be not your cup of tea if you like more of point-and-click puzzles, Lucas Arts or Sierra-style, and longer length.","April 16, 2015","true","1.9"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","0"

If you'd rather read a Lovecraft story than watch Paranormal Activity, The Charnel House Trilogy may be for you.\n\nThe gameplay is simple point-and-click, optionally using arrow keys to move your character.  The plot is laid out in a very linear fashion, with very simple puzzles to advance the story.  It's a slow-burn, dialogue-driven horror experience without cheap jump scares.  There are rare moments where something disturbing may flash onscreen, but there's nothing designed to launch you out of your seat.  The gore is rare and mild, even more so with the low-fi graphics.\n\nThe voice acting is done well (including Jim f'ing Sterling, son), and the music usually is effective at setting the mood.  In the later acts it tends to switch from room to room which can be a bit jarring, especially if one area is meant to be creepy and the next one not.\n\nMy only real gripe with the game is the way it leaves things unresolved - the credits promise a sequel next year, which will hopefully complete the story.  Throughout the game there's a strong sense that you never know what is going on.  This makes sense as it mirrors your character's confusion, but without answers at the finish, the game's ending feels a bit rushed and unsatisfying.\n\nWorth picking up at its current price.","September 5, 2015","true","6.0"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

It isn't a terrible experience, and I really liked the beginning of the game, but there are some points which seem misleading from the get go.  The store page advertizes this as "Three thrilling, horrifying adventure games in one" and that is just not true.  Not only is this not three adventures, it doesn't even feel like ONE whole and complete adventure.\n\nThis title contains three short scenes, which are loosely related and leave an open-ended interpretation of what actually has occured during the course of the story presented.  The first scene is excellently narrated, introduces the main character and piques the player's interest and, although very short, draws the player into the world.  The second scene is a bit surreal, does not exactly correlate to the first scene, but does still allude to it, and brings a bit of a psychological teasing to the narrative.  The third and longest scene is best described as "meh" and kind of diffuses the interest that was piqued in the first and second scenes with a haphazardly thrown out, cliched type of story.  And the very end of the game is an allusion to that fact that another game may come in the future which will bring the player back to learn more of what may or may not have happened in the course of this game.\n\nAnd "game" is used in the loosest sense of the word here.  There is hardly any game at all.  This is more of a psychological experience where the story is narrated (with some excellent voice acting for the most part) and the player is allowed to click on a few icons for added description while the story unfolds itself.\n\nI actually enjoyed most of this title, but as this is being billed as multiple point&click adventures rolled into one, I think that many people who are going to purchase this title are going to end up with something that they feel disappointed with when they have finished.  Also the rushed and unfinished story that the third scene leaves the player with just doesn't lead to a satisfied feeling upon completion.  I am 100% for a psychologically baffling story that people can have long dialogues about long after they are over, but more of the picture should have been presented at the ending rather than forcing people to purchase a different game at a different time to get the satisfaction that completing a game should give.  And for these reasons, I would not recommend this title to fans of the point & click genre.\n","May 13","false","4.4"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

Classic point and click adventure game with an old school mystery/horror story that was at times funny and at times creepy.\n\nFeatures Jim Sterling voice acting as one of the creepy characters, but I actually thought Madeleine Roux stole the show (although she did play the main character, so that would be appropriate). I think the first book wasnt as well acted as the other two, but you can tell she really hit her stride for the third book of the trilogy. The other voice actors did a good job as well.\n\nThe actual story was quite well written, and worked perfectly with the minimalist setting the game offered. The graphics were simple and yet evocative and worked perfectly as well. The gameplay was simple as point and clicks generally are, and functioned with no issues at all. There is also a manual save system, which I always appreciate.\n\nThe game did a great job of tying its story together while still managing to end on a cliff hanger, which is expected to release later this year I believe, although I haven't yet looked into that to confirm. I will be interested to play the next installment.\n\nAll told, I give this a solid 8 creepy train passengers out of 10 possible.

I say little not to be detrimental, but because the game is extremely short. In that short period, though, you’ll be treated to an excellent story with some nice twists, complimented by some good voice acting.\n\nYou being as Alex, a girl who just broke up with her boyfriend, in her apartment. You’re taking a train ride to a place, Auger Island, to meet a friend and hang out. Your first order of business is to check on the delivery status of your train tickets, which requires a password, which requires you to find out what said password is.\n\nAt its core, the game is a point and click adventure title. There are only three major environments, and there are a few unimportant items in each location for you to click and get some information on. Items you need to progress aren’t highlighted, nor do they twinkle, but they’re easy to find.\n\nGraphically, it gets the job done. It has a purposely retro look, with jaggy characters. Backgrounds have some basic details, as do your items, and everything combines to do a decent job. It’s far from a good looking game, but I don’t think it was intended to be anyway.\n\nSound and music work well together for the most part. A few sound effects seem off, and in the later chapter, music tends to turn on and off as you enter different rooms, which is a little bit jarring. The voice acting, for the most part, is great, and gives the characters actual depth. There are a few instances where the acting is a bit blah, but there are not a lot of those.\n\nThe gameplay in Charnel House Trilogy is pretty typical for its genre. You click on items to either get something from it, or to hear a quick note on it. Combining objects is done through your inventory, like dragging your lighter over your cigarette pack to light one. Item combinations are pretty straightforward to guess, and the inventory flashes momentarily whenever you pick something up that can be used.\n\nWhere the game lacks, however, is in its difficulty and length. It’s a very easy game. You will be unlikely to need a guide, as rooms are locked until you need them, and when you do, it’s obvious: for example, a previously locked door will be cracked open next time you go by, indicating it’s time to go in there. It’s also a very short game, easily finished in under two hours. It has no replay value, unless you’ve missed out on some achievements, but there’s only a few of them that are missable; most are tied to the story. Even so, you can save and load as you please, allowing you to go back and collect them if you so choose.\n\nProsGood story with a good twist\nGood voice acting for the majority of the game\nCharacters are interesting\nSound and music complement each other well\nLots of easy achievements for collectorsConsVery short\nNo replay valueSummaryThe Charnel House Trilogy is an excellent horror title to add to your collection, especially if you like point and click adventures. It breaks no new ground, but does what it does well, and is worth your two hours.

The simple mechanics and powerful narrative make this a truly enjoyable title with a very attractive price. It is also supported by a fantastic musical score and full character dialogue audio.\n\nIn this 3 chapter game; you begin by playing the role of Alex Davenport - a young woman who has to embark on a personal journey to Augur Peak by train after receiving some bad news. En route, you meet Dr. Harold Lang and this is where a routine train trip becomes an incredibly eerie experience. I wont elaborate on this because it will spoil the chilling and absorbing events that follow, but it will leave you deeeply engrossed throughout.\n\nThe game mechanics are fairly basic which makes this a title that you can pick up and play straight away. Each chapter is fairly short though and solving the occasional 'puzzle' or what to do next to progress isn't all that challenging. These aren't criticisms though - the way the narrative champions itself outweighs any depth or difficulty concerns.\n\nThe only real disappointment surrounding the game is the length - it will take you about two and a half to 3 hours to complete and the first two chapters are fairly limited although everything you accomplish has some bearing as the game flows nicely. You aren't walking around or searching aimlessly at any time so you feel you are always engaged in the product and everything has some merit. Despite the completion time; you will certainly get your money's worth for what is on offer and the intriguing writing.\n\nOverall, The Charnel House Triolgy is a terrific game that delivers a powerful and absorbing story supported with a truly unique art style.

For how cheap it is, especially as it is on sale at the time of this review, it may be worth a pick up if you enjoy this particular genre of point and click.]\n\nThe Charnel House Trilogy, is a point and click project developed by Owl Cave, and recently released on Steam. It tells the tale of two characters on a train journey to the mysterious Auger Peak, and this is split across three sections - Inhale, Sepulchre, and Exhale - which form the ‘trilogy.’\n\nHaving previously played the second act of this game, which was released as a standalone piece several years back as ‘Sepulchre,’ I was looking forward to seeing what The Charnel House Trilogy exactly was. Sepulchre had a very intriguing mix of Lovecraftian psychological creepiness, and grim morbidity - I expected a similarly enjoyable interactive story.\n\nThat is just what The Charnel House Trilogy actually is - an interactive story. There is no real failure state; just a series of simple puzzles which are easily solved by paying basic attention and using basic logic. Therefore, the game rests entirely upon its narrative; because of this, I will try to keep to generalities, as to avoid spoilers. I would also like to quickly mention that the options menu/etc is completely fine - limited, but appropriate for the game.\n\nThe first arc of the the game, titled ‘Inhale,’ is a seemingly self aware 15 minute introduction to Alex Davenport (voiced by author Madeleine Roux) - one of the two main characters of this game. While the player clicks around her apartment, Alex comments on objects in typical point and click fashion, in a condescending way which seems to be a form of satire on the genre itself; likewise, the chapter offers a lot of ‘in-jokes’ about the games industry/PC gaming/games journalism, which are obviously meant to appeal to the player. But they simply do not. Instead of being presented with a wry wit, they are just quite annoying, falling suspect to the things that they seem to be mocking. When you add in the cameos from people in games media, such as Jim Sterling and Cara Ellison, the first part of the game really just seems littered with references which do not offer any real grounding to the narrative. They do not sow the seeds of a committed pastiche (as The Bard’s Tale was to RPGs), nor do they offer any real comedic value.\n\nWhen the game reaches the second arc, however, the game does become more enjoyable. ‘Sepulchre’ switches to a more curious setting, with a better written, and more likeable character - Dr. Harold Lang. I was rather fond of this section when it was in the standalone form, but when it is played straight after the underwhelming ‘Inhale,’ a lot of the immersiveness and atmosphere is heavily mired. Whereas ‘Sepulchre’ is a committed confident ghost story, on a train with a layout which lends itself perfectly to the point and click genre, the questions it made me previously ask myself several years ago, are unnecessarily drowned by lingering memories of ‘Inhale,’ and confused expectations of ‘Exhale.’\n\n‘Exhale’ brings back the character of Alex, but it does not bring back the shortcomings of her previous arc. I actually found the character herself to be a bit more likeable, and the setting of ‘Sepulchre’ is recycled in an interesting way which lends itself to the gameplay. These points are far outweighed, however, by a complete change of everything which made the narrative in arc two enjoyable; the sly, creepy horror, which could have been a lost chapter of The King In Yellow, is now replaced with a frightfully naff stalker/ex-boyfriend… thing. It still takes place on the supernatural train, but this works negatively, because answers you expect are left vague, and the writing seems to adopt a method of not explaining anything, which just creates a covering of pretentiousness, rather than the gradual clever unveiling one would expect.\n\nWhen you wander from the narrative aspects of the game, there is actually a lot of praise to be given. The art style is beautiful, and definitely one of the more recent examples of pixel art done right. Likewise, the music, which is ever-present, but never intruding, provides a really gorgeous tone, which compliments the developments well. The voice acting is incredibly hit-and-miss, with poor writing magnifying a lot of otherwise passable lines (e.g. Jim Sterling delivers the one believable use of the word ‘♥♥♥♥ing’ in the entire game). I found myself more inclined to just read the text myself, and skip through, more and more as the game progressed.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to showcase one particular scene which explains everything I felt about the game at once: at the end of ‘Inhale,’ Alex gazes out of her window at the street across from her New York apartment - the soundtrack is very fitting to the fantastically drawn rainy scene. This is intruded, by a very badly written monologue from Alex - it reminded me of a GCSE creative writing task in style, with an uninteresting set of descriptions slowly ruining an otherwise pleasant visual experience. This echoes the game itself, which has one genuinely decent chapter (Sepulchre), overpowered by two completely unfitting ones.\n\nThe game seems to hint towards a future installment in the Charnel House series of games, and it could be quite good, if it fills in the gaps that we are left with at the end of the Trilogy. The issue resides in the fact that these gaps are in a ground comprised of already ill fitting narratives, badly written characters, and aspects which will be tough to explain enjoyably.","April 22, 2015","false","1.5"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","21","33","0","0"

But, it's barely even worth that money.  Good only to experience as a curiosity.  Game is >>very<< linear, and not very articulate at it's storytelling.

Lovecraft was a master at fully fleshing out characters through thought and behaviour, and weaving a mysterious world in which those characters exist and interact.  This game, on the contrary, is just a convoluted mess, and a very pale comparison at best.  Definitely no replay value at all.  Don't get me wrong.  The actual concept was creatively a good base, but the final result was poorly executed.  But, I still encourage the developers to hang in there.  The only way to improve your craft/art is to continue doing it and learn from your previous attempts.  Lovecraft, just like any other artist/writer, had to endure a few "misses" in order to hone the skills to create true masterpieces.  So even though I don't rate this particular game highly, there is something "special" there, so I'm looking forward to some new and better work from these folks.","December 17, 2015","false","1.9"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

Heavily laden with symbolism and angst, this little goth-story is seemingly no more than a teaser for a hopefully more fulfilling experience that is to be released in 2016, that shows quite a bit of promise. It is kinda eerie but did not reach "The Last Door"-levels, which the "sequel" will hopefully rectify in the future.  Regarding the writing, the "dramatic reveal" towards the end was a bit too pulp-y for my taste and put too much emphasis on the main characters real world problems - which seemed kind of out of place (considering the place), but then again this will perhaps be explained at some point in time and feel more fitting all things considered.\n\nThe artwork is fantastic, I love the backgrounds, animations are a bit stiff and sprites are too thin and tall for my taste - nontheless, the game is beautiful and with the exception of Jim Sterling that was just Jim Sterling to me, the voice acting is pretty good - puzzles are really straightforward and very easy, allowing maximum focus on the events that take place and the story that unfolds. As some other reviewers pointed out, this is more of a visual novel disguised as a point & click adventure.\n\nA neat, little thing if you are into the whole goth-thing.

I enjoyed some aspects of it while at the same time despising others. It was, essentially, not the game I was hoping to play.\n\nWhat do you expect in a horror/adventure game?\nIf you want to be outright "scared", this is probably not the game for you. Rather than all-out fear, the game tries to create an atmosphere of suspense and unease. It succeeds in that, somewhat.\nIf you want a game that feels like a complete story, this is not for you either. The developer has said on the forums that they believe the game constitutes such, but I disagree strongly with that analysis. The Charnel House Trilogy largely feels like an extended prologue for a game that doesn't exist yet.\nIf you want a lengthy experience, this game does not provide that. It can be completed in two hours, and for some players quite possibly less.\nIf you want to feel a strong connection to a game's characters, that isn't likely here. Given the game's short run time, the personalities of its two protagonists never become fully developed. They are rendered sympathetic but bland, which in my case lead to a disconnect regarding the story. I was interested in the story itself, but did not care about the characters or their fates.\nIf you want challenging puzzles, this isn't that kind of game. This point I think actually worked in its favor. The complete absence of "adventure game logic", that perverse and inane guessing game of the developer's intentions that would require mood altering substances to even vaguely resemble coherence is entirely absent. That was refreshing, at least.\nIf all you want is a dark, somewhat intriguing plot, The Charnel House Trilogy provides that. If you want to kill a couple hours, you could certainly do worse. However, the resounding thought I had during my playtime with the game was a feeling of "incompleteness" that is difficult to fully describe. I liked the game's atmosphere and sense of mystery. I liked the kind of horror it attempted to create. Even so, there were too many things I disliked to truly recommend it. If and when the game's sequel is released, perhaps they can be recommended collectively as a complete story. For the moment, however, The Charnel House Trilogy is one best left aside.\n","February 25","false","2.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I tend to burn out on point and click adventure games some where around the half way point. When puzzles don't lend themselves easily to rationally explained or logical solutions; and you must resort to combining every item with every other item or try every item on every interactable object there tends to be an extreme amount of fatigue that grows exponentially.\n\nThis game does not do that. Almost at every point. The inner dialogue of the player character or NPC's tell you, essentially, when and where to go. There is almost no puzzle solving. Or in some cases there just aren't any useless items to distract you from what may actually work in the situation.\n\nThere are 3 chapters. The first, “Inhale”, being surprising and extremely short. Remains very well paced.  and has a very strange reference to Ayn Rand and BioShockThe next 2 chapters “Sepulcher” and “Exhale” Both increase in length from the predecessor. However the whole thing is roughly 2 hours long.\n\nI really like this look of this game. It seems sort of... childish. Which makes the things that are not childish that much more effective.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=429569165\n\nThe voice acting isn't the best. But that's mostly because the characters say things to explain things to the player. Things no one would ever say that seem extremely out of place.\n\nMy only complaint is the ending doesn't truly wrap everything up. Its left sort of ambiguous. And some aspects are a bit predictable. Though I personally think the way its told make up for that.\n\nAll in all, nice little adventure game that doesn't overstay its welcome.

There are some very postive elements to the game, but in the end I can't really recommend it. If there was a "maybe" option, I'd probably pick that, but since it's "yes" or "no", I am unfortunately leaning towards "no".\n\nPOSITIVE\n+ Interesting protagonist. She makes you want to know more about her and her story.\n+ Atmospheric visuals and music.\n+ The story has elements of creepiness/weirdness that is appealing to a horror/pulp fan like me\n\nNEGATIVE\n- The game is too short. I like short games, but this one was completed in two hours. It's a trilogy and yes, the two hours includes all three chapters. Even for a short game it felt more like a prologue than an acutal game.\n- There is a bad balance between unexplained/mysterious story elements and overt exposition. In the beginning everything seems almost normal, but some weird things are introduced. That's interesting. Then in chapter two some very weird things are introduced that makes you go "is this story just a dream?". And in chapter three it continues, but then all of a sudden an antagonist is revealed and he pretty much just tells you what has happened in the past, in the real world. But in the game you are stuck in a world that's obviously not real, and there's no explanation for that.\n- The voice acting is very mixed. The protagonist (who does most of the talking) is really good. But some of the others are bad because of three things: Some of the voices has bad audio quality, some are badly acted/read and some voices simply don't fit the character. I read somewhere that some of the voices are done by guests from the gaming community. That would explain the mixed quality.\n- Too linear gameplay. I understand that a story like this one cannot be totally multidirectional. But in this game you literally leave one train compartment to find that all other compartments are locked except one where the door is visually half open. Then you enter that compartment. When you are finished and leave the compartment another compartment is now open. Then you go there. It's simply too linear.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend the game if it was perhaps two times bigger, less linear in the exploration and if there was a better balance between story elements that are suggested versus overt exposition.\nIf they continue development of the game (they should - it definitely has potential) they ought to aim for a balance where there are more things the player can explore on his own to make a theory about what's going on and less things that are told in linear dialogue. Right now the player is trapped: As players we are told exactly what we are told - no more, no less. And for a player like me, I really wanted to explore some things further, while in other cases I actually wanted less verbal exposition. But all players get exactly the same in exactly the same linear order. So you are trapped in a story where some things are too explicit while other things are so unexplained and impossible that you end up going "fine, then it's just a dream, that's all".","February 22","false","2.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

So take my main criticism with a further grain of salt until I investigate it and update my review accordingly.\n\nI haven't been this conflicted about a game in a while. Let's see, what it does well? The presentation, the music, the atmosphere are all excellent. This is a horror-ish game and the mood, pacing, suspense are superb. There are some banal elements here and there but oh boy, do I genuinely wish all horror developers learned from this game. The game is more focused on being unsettling than trying to be outright scary and that works out amazingly. The unique mood the game immerses you in is hard to forget.\n\nThe writing is solid, and the game tells some interesting stories, both explicit and vague. The characters are vibrant, distinct and interesting. The personal stories presented here are a very decent and satisfying part of this work. A certain theme is prominently present in the game, and while it can be considered technically kinda thrilling, it can also just as well be considered mundane. The metaphors and symbolisms surrounding the theme are probably some of the best I've seen, which is both impressive and slightly disappointing as a waste of potential. But wait, there is some intriguing underlying lore that can possibly redeem this if it's interesting enough. The whole Charnel House thing, yeah? If only the game actually told you, well, anything substantial about this story branch.\n\nWhich also happens to be titular. Oops. And that's the major shortcoming of the game as far as I'm concerned. It merely teases you with its titular story branch, only giving some bare hints at what it might be about. And look, I'm all for mystery but here the game leaves me in the dark about even whether I really like it or not since for me a significant portion of judgement depends on how interesting the underlying context is. But I can't evaluate it because the game doesn't expand on it that much. It does somewhat openly promise a sequel, and while I don't see anything wrong with that per se, it depends on the sequel a bit too much for my liking, remaining a very unfinished work on its own. Which also isn't inherently wrong, but it becomes hard to judge for me because of it. And well, there simply are better, more satisfying ways to present a mysterious unfinished narrative. There got to be. Also it's worth pointing out that I found Alex definitely sympathetic and I absolutely enjoyed learning about her life, but also I honestly can't say I like her enough to prefer that to some cool intriguing supernatural storyline. And since the game isn't called "Alex's Life" I dare to suggest this imbalance of story branch reveals favoring hers is a bit of an actual flaw.\n\n\nSo yeah, if you can tolerate vagueness, unfinishedness and merciless cliffhangers then by all means go for it. There is a lot to enjoy here and it does horror differently from how everybody else does horror. As you can see, I definitely enjoyed it enough for this to remain a cautious but positive recommendation. But if not, then I suppose you should wait for the sequel first. Because if the sequel provides a satisfying explanation, or a more satisfying mystery at least, then this was all very good apparently.","April 17, 2015","true","2.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It feels like every character was written to sound slightly tired and distant, to showcase a dreariness to the world, yet unfortunately no-one seems to be able to sound like anything more than entirely bored and disconnected to the project. I made me skip ALL of the dialogue in act 3 because I couldn't bear to listen to a cast of people who seemed like they didn't want to be there.\n\nThis game is also criminally short, which doesn't give the premise of the story time to breathe. So before you so much as get into the groove of things. It's over with a tiny little bow on top, though it leaves a little more to use in a possible sequel. In simpler terms, this game is at dire risk of being played through and then refunded, since it can be beaten in 1.5 hours if you're quick. Yikes.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are also not the most interesting. They can all be just considered fetch quests with a liberal amount of backtracking which comes across like backtracking, the fact that act 2 & 3 essentially use the same art assets cements this bad taste.\n\nI like some really key things about this game, but for $6.50 I would rather have gotten myself a burger.\n","July 24, 2015","false","1.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","10","15","2","0"

Completely unbelievable, especially as a 29 year old myself.\n\nHarold Lang is a lot better and all the other characters are pretty cool. Lang's reactions are more believable and realistic. I like the train conductor Ol' Don the best though. I will say I love the old pixelated style a lot and the concept of being on a train where everything goes wrong.","April 16, 2015","true","4.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

There is no conflict of interests making this disclosure necessary, but please bear this in mind when judging the balance of objectivity to subjectivity in my assessment of this product. It is because of this and the inherent flaws in a numerical rating system that I give no score.\n\nThe Charnel House Trilogy may not be a game in the conventional sense, lacking a challenge to overcome, but the alternative genre and take on point and click do not at all detract from the interactive narrative. And this is what sets it apart from so many of its would be peers on the digital shelves. Owlcave didn't make this choice vainly, in a gratuitous or vacuous manner; the genre and narrative serve each other well.\n\nMechanically, the game is competentently executed but not without flaws. The voice work seems recited rather than acted at times, a flaw that Exhale seems to soundly move away from. Variable resolutions would be appreciated, but my main complaint lies in that there is no option to mute sound on focus loss — resulting in rare sound artifacts and looping glitches while tabbed out if you happen to alt+tab at an inoportune time. This appears to be purely an inescapable glitch with the engine rather than an overight.\n\nNarratively, I'm quite frankly astonished. Whether it be the genre's saturation or my own expectations, I expected quality but not quite this much.\n\nThe trilogy was originally Sepulchre, an installation in which doctor Lang, an archaeologist on his way to conduct research on Augur Peak and experiences a series of increasingly surreal events of a symbolism he is clueless about. Inhale and Exhale later completed the trilogy, more fleshed out installations that give the original context and bring it into the build up to what is setting out to be an intriguing canon by adding a fresh perspective to an uncanny journey. A journey where time, memory and identity are warped beyond the boundaries of sanity; a burden each protagonist deals with differently.\n\nAlex Davenport, protagonist of Inhale and Exhale, is a well rounded character that significantly strays from horror and alternative storytelling conventions by retaining a degree of roots to the mundane but not deluding herself into denying that she is departed from it. What sets her apart in this regard is that Exhale features a very well written transition from being suitably shocked by to actively partaking in the disturbing ride that something more twisted than fate conspired to involve her in.\n\nNeither losing itself in the esoteric for the sake of padding its dialogue nor playing it safe, The Charnel House Trilogy is a short but oh so sweet breath of fresh air for the genre.\n\n\n\n...Oh for the love of- Alex, will you put on that coat, it's raining cats and dogs out there.","April 16, 2015","true","5.2"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","27","49","3","0"

In the first chapter, Inhale, we meet Alex, a 20-something woman who seems to be working to overcome some hardships – a recent break-up that’s still in the forefront of her mind, a sick father.  Alex will be going on a journey. This first act functions mainly as a set-up for the rest of the game, and introduces us to the characters and themes that will be explored more deeply later on. Act 2, Sepulchre, was actually available as a standalone game for a while and is made stronger by the bookending chapters. Sepulchre focuses on Harold, who boarded a train with Alex, and has to deal with strange events that are happening. While Harold seems to be in an almost fugue-like state, Alex is plagued by her memories, which weigh heavily on her. Act 3, Exhale, goes back to Alex and does an amazing job at tying everything together.\n\nIt’s hard to say a lot about the story without giving things away, but the titles (Charnel House, Sepulchre) should certainly give you an idea of the direction it takes. While it is a horror game, it’s not scary in the traditional sense, but provides a gradually increasing sense of unease that worms its way in and turns into dread. The writing by Ashton Raze is on point. Dialogue goes from sounding completely natural to Lynchian levels of bizarre. The best praise I can give is that from Act 2 on, no line is wasted. Everything has a purpose, and is building towards something. It’s a very well constructed story with a self-aware script, and it gets better as it goes.\n\nFor a game that maxes out at a 320 x 200 resolution, not a pixel is out of place. The style is very reminiscent of the Blackwell series (Ben Chandler did work on both this and The Blackwell Epiphany). The character portraits that pop up during conversations are lovely and the backgrounds, few that they are, are attractive.\n\nThe soundtrack often blends seamlessly into the background, but when it becomes more prominent, it’s really quite great. I highly recommend playing this with headphones, I put them on halfway through and was immediately impressed by how great it sounded. The voice acting is competent. Madeleine Roux’s Alex started off a little flat, but got better as the game went on. I have no complaints about the rest of the main players. Jim Sterling did well in his turn as a too-friendly neighbour, and the smaller parts were also generally well done. Though to be honest, I can’t hear Abe Goldfarb without thinking of Joey Malone.\n\nThe game is light on puzzles, but since the story is the star, that works out. There’s no mindless combining of inventory items or pixel-hunting for objects. Gameplay is quite straightforward, and I think more challenging puzzles would have been a distraction.\n\nI only have one real complaint about the game. Inhale is peppered with in-jokes and nods to the voice actors. In-jokes are okay, but the first 10 or so minutes of the game consisted of little else, so that it was a bit of a turn-off.  Once the game got that out of its system, the story started steaming ahead and I was more than happy to go along for the ride.","April 16, 2015","true","3.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

A train voyage in the middle of the night, where things just get wierder and creepier as things progress. A fair bit of mind screw in the plot that defineatly feels like it's going somewhere(which presumably we'll see in 2016).\n\nIt's short though. I clocked in at 80 minutes for all three episodes complete, which is probably due to a lack of puzzles(and what few puzzles are in the game are simple ones). However, I enjoyed the story and the atmosphere quite a bit, so the short length leads to good, tense pacing.\n\nThere were a few small annoyances for me. The main character, Alex, comes across as kind of emo and annoying in the first episode(thankfully, she's a lot more relatable once she's on the train) . The other annoyance was the fact that Jim Sterling-son voice acting is intially distracting. It's not that he does a bad job(far from it) but knowing his voice from other places made it hard for me to see him as a character and not Jim Sterling's voice coming out of someone elses mouth. At least intially. As the game went on I got used to hearing it and it didn't bother me. All of these were minor issues for me and both inherent to the first(and wearkest) episode.\n\nVery much reminds me of the Last Door and if you liked that, you'll likely enjoy this.

I wouldn't have bought it if I had known how short it was.\nI honestly am not seeing why other people have given this such good reviews, it did nothing for me.\n\n","May 5, 2015","false","2.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Far from it.\n\nThe story of the game is your journey to Augur Peak, going there in the middle of the night ridding in a train that would change, explain, confuse and reveal everything to the main character that you play as, Alex, a young charming woman with a troubling life.\n\nAlong your fateful journey you meet all sorts of interesting characters from who knows when or where, and each of those characters have their own story to tell but all of them come back connecting to the main character, and to the destination Augur Peak.\n\nThe gameplay is like any other point and click of recent years, click on anything that is of interest, one that you can interact with, and the character you play as would then give her / his thoughts on the interacted object or person. Collect items whenever you think you can or need so that it can be used to solve a problem / issue later on, which aren’t that difficult and mainly goes with the flow of the game.\n\nThe game is rightfully creepy, the story is mysterious and grabs your interest and attention in the first five minutes of playing it. The story progresses as I’m in a fateful train, keeping me intrigued as more characters appear and nicely written dialogue backing it up. After entering the train I found myself playing as a different character, one with a.. somewhat confusing but still understandable and nice end.\n\nAs I walk through the hallway of the shadow of death in the train Playing as the first main character again, exploring and progressing through the game in the train and meeting yet new and old unexpected characters, revealing twists and turns throughout the end of the game. Speaking of the ending, it’s a great one as it left me hanging and excited to see and play the sequel, and it did it in a common sense and satisfying way.\n\nThe Charnel House Trilogy is a fine piece of point and click adventure game, one that looks great, plays good, and sounds wonderful, a game that I’d rank up high along side games like Blackwell Epiphany, but what I really loved about the game, aside from the soundtrack, is how dark and twisted it is, and how it has the balls to be dark and give dialogue that we barely see in other games, if there is any with such dialogue. It is a short game but a damn interesting and entertaining one, and gave me an experience that I I’ll never forget any time soon. After playing this game, I can’t wait to see what comes up next in 2016.","April 16, 2015","true","1.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","0"

The reason for calling it a thingy rather than a game is because the puzzles are waaaay too easy. Its probably the easiest point and click game i have ever played. The art style is awesome, sorta reminds me of older point and click games like Beneath a Steel Sky. The voice acting is really good (except for just one extra) and the naritive is driven through voiced dialogue amongst the three parts of this game that make up the trilogy. The story itself is... i wouldn't call it horror, more creepy or earie. Even the background music sets the tone. I would recomend this to anyone who is looking for a short and strange, well written experience.\nI should say that the demo is available for free download on the store page and consists of the second part of this trilogy. Also i should mention that this game did not run well for me in full screen, and the resolution was not adjustable, it basically gave me strange mouse issues. However runniing it in windowed mode was a really great experience and fixed that completely. Also, it is just soo short and i wish it was longer.\nNOTE - If you are visually impared, this is one of those games that is entirely voiced. More over it works well in windowed mode with windows magnifier, even though the text is also very large and legible. Now and then there might be an object that you might miss but this game and its levels are so small, you will probably find it faster than you might expect.","June 29, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story, while at times strange and disjointed, is compelling enough to keep you playing without holding your hand through solving puzzles or providing thorough explanation.  You start playing as Alex Davenport, an apathetic 27 year old with some serious distress in her past.  She, along with archeologist Harold Lang board a train for Auger Peak Island, where they hope to find... something?  The train itself could be many things, but 'of this world' is certainly not one of them.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in classic point and click adventures, or horror games with something a bit more than faulty animatronics or yet another zombie infestation.

This is something that seems to happen in a lot of point and click games, but not here.\n+ Decent pixel art graphics (if you like that sort of thing)\n+ Great story which has chilling moments - it's a subtle terror, though\n+ Liberal dose of swearing (I realise some may see this as a con, but this isn't a game for kids, and it fitted the situation and situation)\n+ Voice acting is OK (not brilliant though).\n\nCons\n- Very short. Calling it a 'trilogy' really does give the impression you're getting three games here, which isn't the case at all. There's 3 short chapters in an overarching story and is one of the shortest games I've played for a while. (It probably goes without saying that there's no real replayability here either)\n- A few minor irritants - for example, in chapter two, for most of the hotspots you can interact with, the dialogue is the same whether you select 'examine' or 'interact/use'. In the context of gameplay the responses you get therefore don't always make sense. This isn't the case in the other chapters, so although it's a small thing it just seems like a weird thing to cut corners on\n- Gameplay is very easy/basic - although I play a lot of point and clicks, I'm pretty rubbish at them and usually have to refer to a walkthrough at least point during a game. Definitely not the case here - the game actually drops heavy handed hints even when you don't need them, basically telling you what to do in places. I know other games tend to give you hints after you've been pootling around for a while and are clearly stuck - I'm not sure why this game tells you pretty much what you should be doing before you even have a chance to try anything (example scene - 'I could kill for a cigarette right now')\n- Story is a little more ambiguous than I would like in places.\n\nOverall\nThe pros outweigh the cons - this is is a great little game that's worth a look if you like point and clicks or horror themed games.\n","August 25, 2015","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think this is a marvelous piece of point-and-click style art.

Very well put together for a nice atmosphere.\n\nTo say that this is a "horror" title... I don't know, I'd say that it's more a thriller of sorts. It starts off slow but interesting, then the second chapter leaves you questioning what exactly is happening, when it is all gathered up nicely in the third chapter. Excellent writing for a short story! Also, a nice little sequence in the end leaves some room for future titles which I, for one, will be getting for sure.\n\nThe only "downside" of the game, if you can even call it that, is that it's relatively short.

But it's a good story.  I'm looking forward to future titles from Owl Cave.\n\nBefore you buy it, though:  calling it a "Trilogy" and billing each chapter as its own game is very misleading.  All together, this is just one game, and a fairly short one at that, with a plot that's left hanging for a sequel.  The six dollar priceline is probably reasonable if you're used to paying 60 for triple-A garbage and want to value art appropriately.  As a broke person, I don't regret grabbing it while it was on sale-- 2 dollars for 45 minutes of great storytelling is relatively good.\n\nGenerally, if your only pressing criticism of a thing is that you wanted more of it, that's a good sign.","February 28","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I saw this game from a review by a YouTuber by the name of PushingUpRoses. I saw her in depth review and it seemed like something that I would really enjoy. It was a game that caught my attention, especially when I found out that Jim Sterling had played a voice over role in the game. It starts out nice enough but slowly makes that downhill descent into the macabre. It slowly gets under your skin and stays under. It allows you to piece together things but then slowly breaks them apart until you really do not understand whats happening. The game can at times be disjointed, but in a way that's what the game is trying to do. It is trying to get you to keep guessing at what will happen next. As for the story, its all very eerie and I can recall certain times in which I got the cold shivers from what had been going on. The voice over work is done very well, there is absolutely no "Moon Logic" in this fun little point and click adventure. Its a brisk journey through a portion of the horror genre and I really enjoyable one at that. I picked this up while it was on sale and I am really happy with my purchase.\n\nIf you're a fan of point and click adventure games than you will definitely enjoy this one, even more so if you appreciate the horror elements. So check it out.","February 9","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I liked the ideas behind it, and the characters, and the voice acting is really excellent -- but the sort of trippy horror atmosphere where you're never sure what's real didn't work for me. I love that style of horror, and I know that's the feeling they were trying to evoke, but the fact that you're so railroaded, unable to explore and unable to fail, ruins the immersion and the sense of danger and mystery. In addition, the fact that it's called a trilogy made me expect a longer game that explored the lore in more depth, not a 2.5 hour game with lots of hanging threads and a sequel hook.\n\nIf you like short adventure games, I'd say it's still worth checking out for the things it does well. (And honestly, if the game were sitting at mixed reviews instead of very positive, I might have marked this review thumbs up instead of thumbs down, just to balance things out.) Just adjust your expectations before going in.","March 26","false","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, once I got sucked into it, a whole new aspect opened up to me.\n\nRemember that time when you were little, and your parents left you alone in the house for the first time? You felt oddly excited, even a little courageous... until you heard a bump in the next room. At first you were sure it was nothing, but then your little childish brain began to run wild, and told you that there was something wrong. You couldn't put your finger on it, but there was something about it that all of a sudden made you want to rush to your parents, but they weren't there. You were alone, and your only recourse was to curl up in a corner and wait out the storm.\n\nCharnel House is the video game equivalent of that memory. Although it doesn't assault you with blood and guts, there's something about it that's just... off. As you work to unravel the mystery, the entire story begins a subtle, but noticable descent into madness. It gets to the point that you'd rather a monster did jump out and try to tear off your face, because then you'd have a definite answer to the question of what's out there.\n\nIt's short, but every gosh-darn second is packed with atmosphere and tension. Slowly but surely, an overwhelming sense of hopelessness seeps over you, and the plan becomes not to survive, but to figure out what's going on before you die.\n\nIt's definitely one of the better games to come out this year so far. Sure, it doesn't have guns and explosions, but who needs that when you're slowly urinating down your own leg?","November 8, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Here's my full video review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/m5GFDFsEs8k\n\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHello viewers!  Welcome to another episode of A Bird's Eye View.  My name is Endeavor, and today we are reviewing The Charnel House Trilogy.  Developed by Owl Cave and published by Mastertronic,  this game was released on April 16, 2015.\n\nThe Charnel House Trilogy is a point-and-click adventure with a horror twist.  The story is told over three parts and revolves around two protagonists taking a train to Augur Peak.  Alex Davenport is the first character we follow.  She’s a seemingly average woman in her twenties that has just experienced a bad breakup.  She meets Doctor Harold Lang, our second main character, as they depart the station.\n\nIn the beginning, the ambiance and feel of the game gives the impression of a slice-of-life story, albeit with a few darker notes.  As the story progresses, the game reminds us of its true genre.  While the first two parts introduce us to the elements at play, it is the final chapter when everything comes together.\n\nThe storytelling in The Charnel House Trilogy is superb.  The themes, writing, and plot are more than strong enough to earn a recommendation on their own.  This is not a horror game that relies on jump scares and gore to shock the player.  Instead, expect to be slowly unnerved by the atmosphere as the game presents seemingly innocuous things-- things revealed over time to be far more sinister than it at first appeared.\n\nThe game leaves you with many unanswered questions.  How much of what Alex and Harold see on the train is real?  Are we to take what happens metaphorically, or is the train granting the protagonists an insight into their lives?  These questions lingered in my mind long after I finished playing.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it is similar to other point-and-click adventures.  The player has an inventory to store found items.  We walk around, talk to people, and interact with the environment with mouse clicks.  The puzzles in the game are not very complicated, and most can be thought through logically (unlike other point-and-click adventures which can require an almost compulsory level of trial-and-error).  I found the simplicity of the puzzles to be in the game's favor, as the central focus was on the story.\n\nEach episode of the game averages about forty minutes long, so the whole thing can easily be completed in two hours.  This is mostly due to the limited scenes and the ease with which the puzzles can be solved.  While the game left me wanting more, I feel that my time playing it was well spent, so the shortness of the story is only a minor criticism.\n\nThe voice acting was great for the most part.  The actors sold their roles well, and the audio was good for the major characters.  There were only a few spots where things could have been better (which had more to do with sound quality than actor performance).\n\nThe game's retail price is $5.99.  For a short but well put together horror story, I give The Charnel House Trilogy a strong recommendation.  It's currently available on Steam for Windows computers.\n\nAnd with that, my review draws to a close.  Thank you for watching, and don't forget to hit the “like” button if you enjoyed my video.

This game has terrific music that really makes you feel as if you are there. The game is short, a few hours of gameplay, but the adventure element and the story are tied together very well.\n\nThe adventuring aspect of the game is nothing overly complicated; the puzzles and choices are not that complex, which can be appealing to those new to the genre, or looking for a not to heavy experience. What is especially well done with this game, however, is\nhow well the story ties into the mechanics of the game.\n\nThe story is astonishingly good; well done, and backed up by well by the music and  atmosphere. You play as a young female traveling on a train to see a friend, and sort out your life. The story takes more of a dark turn however, and becomes an adventure of oneself through the darkest parts of what they may fear to face. To come out on top and try to realize who they are if they are able to. You never feel like you are lost; if by some chance you get confused in the story, you are easily able to get back on track. The story and adventure draw you into the experience, and by the end of the game, I was ready to do whatever was necessary to fight in my own way to help the heroine. I felt connected, I wanted her to succeed.\n\nWhether you are a hard core adventurer genre player, or crave a more casual experience, this game does an excellent job of bridging the gap between both. The story is great, the simplicity of the graphics and the music weave together seamlessly to create an amazing game.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch\nif you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho\n","September 27, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I mean I get the idea, but it's not developed enough and leaves you wondering what's the purpose of this place. The closest thing I can compare the enviroment to is Silent Hill, where people face their fears and vices by the power of the town, and it's supposed to change people who go in there. It's kind of like that, but without the purpose part, soo it feels pointless for me.\n\nOther than that, I think it's a good shocker story, but nothing groundbreaking. It's worth a quick spin if you're a horror, or just thriller fan. But it offers no more than that unfortunately, as the game also lacks memorable characters or moments for that matter.","March 10","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is not a spoiler, this should be a disclaimer for people who are gonig to buy this game and want resolve.\n\nGameplay is obviously not the main focus of the game, where puzzles - calling them that for a lack of a better word - have trivial answers right there or with the game itself smacking you in the face with the solution under the mask of a 'hint'. Gameplay has to make way for the game's selfindulgent story, that start off with so much winks and self referential in-jokes that made me cringe.\n\nWhile I understand the tone that the game is trying to set with atmosphere, the game writing is all over the place that I hardly know what the game is trying to say? Is it about breaking up? horror? teenage drama? The sheer amount of cringe worth dialogue and flat wooden voice acting made me stop caring almost 10 minutes into the game.\n\nThe voice acting in particular does the game a disservice, as sometimes it fails to convey the gravity of the situation and thus making it way less impactful than the creators probably intended for it to be.\n\nIt's lack of attention to detail like that turns the game into a bore at points, most of your time in the game will be spent walking in between 2 carriages to do one single element to unlock the next story section. While great adventure games usually will have multithreads that eventually combine to solve the situation and advance the story forward, CHT only requires one of the time, making it extremely linear even for an adventure game.\n\nText doesn't change at items after you solve the puzzle, character dialogue is inconsistent (a character chould be snoring unless you give him an item), some times items are referenced that don't exist in the gameworld ... etc\n\nShort, incomplete, badly written, badly voice acted, no attention to detail and horrible game design choices, I would not recommend this game to anyone other than friends of the people who made it.","June 17, 2015","false","1.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I quickly became sucked in to the gloomy world depicted and remained transfixed until I completed the game. I think what impresses me most about the narrative is what great job they did with the balancing and pacing of mystery. In a story like this, if too much is left unknown for too long things tend to become overly abstract and tedious, but if the story explains too much the 'magic' of not knowing is gone and things start to feel artificial. This game hits the mark perfectly, by the end of the game you will have some idea of what is going on, but enough unanswered question to leave you wanting more (and trying to construct you own theories in the meantime.)\n\nBeyond excellent storytelling, this game sports a solid cast of voice actors in all its lead rolls. A few of the minor characters are a little underwhelming, but altogether everything is passable and doesn't take you out of the story.\n\nThe graphics take the form of the classic adventure 2D style and are beautiful and well-crafted for the purposes of this game. Likewise the music is atmospheric, haunting, and fits the created world perfectly.\n\nIn terms of adventure game gameplay, things are fairly simple and straight forward. Not much in the way of puzzles beyond the usual "What do I do with this object?" If you are looking for a challenge this wouldn't be my first recommendation. The game is also fairly short, it took me about 2 hours to finish it, but considering its overall quality and the lower price I am fully satisfied with my purchase.","April 17, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Uhm, the voice acting is not the greatest and I felt confuseda little by the end cutscene, but I think that's due to my not paying much attention to what was going on; it didn't really grab me in.\n\nThis adventure game is more about dialogue than anything to convey it's message, and it spoon feeds progression, which I didn't like that much.\n\nHOWEVER, it did have some good WTF moments that I liked, and I believe Spulchre to be the strongest of the "books".\n\nAlright time killer.\n","April 17, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Music is excellent; writing and voice acting are generally solid. The puzzles and graphics are minimalistic but very well executed. The third act stumbles badly several times, though, and the attempts at "edgy" dialogue generally fall flat. See below for a (mostly spoiler-free) breakdown of each episode.\n\nInhale: A short, two-screen prologue that introduces the protagonist Alex. Her wry attitude, combined with the gritty urban setting of this chapter, calls to mind the city segments of The Longest Journey in the best possible way. Certain reviewers were put off by Inhale's occasional metajokes--but have they ever played Sierra or Lucasarts classics? Even the most serious of them (Gabriel Knight, The Dig) had their share of goofy humor. The writing of this prologue is solid and entertaining, and several scenes are downright amazing. Alex's penchant for random f-bombs strains believability here and there, but it's forgivable.\n\nSepulchre: the standout of the collection. This time, you control archaeologist Harold Lang as he takes a very strange trainride. Unlike the first chapter, Sepulchre is a pure psychological horror game. Writing and pacing are absolutely top notch, and the atmosphere is thick. In many ways, it has the logic of a bad dream--there's a feeling of menace, and terrifying stuff happens (I'll never look at luggage the same way again), but nothing fits together. The effect reminds me of early Silent Hill. Harold is a charming protagonist, and his gradual breakdown in reaction to events is particularly believable.\n\nExhale: the longest and shakiest of the chapters. You control Alex again, only this time aboard the train from Sepulchre. Early on (and, in places, later on), this chapter is as strong and scary as the last two, but things start to head downhill. Alex's foul mouth goes from excusably mediocre to painfully amateurish--at times it comes off like a teenager's "edgy" submission to FanFiction.net. The dream logic from Sepulchre gets traded in, at several key points, for bland overexplanation. The subtle horror of Silent Hill gives way to beat-you-over-the-head shock tactics. To be specific:\n\nBEGIN MAJOR SPOILERS\nThe plotline with Rob is just bad. Psychologically, it's not believable for a traumatized father to become a completely unrelatable monster. The scene where Alex realizes that Gavin is the bartender is one of the game's high points, but having him explain their awkward, realistic breakup as the manipulation of a psychotic killer is awful. Amputations? Head on a torso? Seriously? It reads, again, like a teenager's attempt to be "edgy": this is the kind of uninspired, unrelatable silliness that goths used to post on DeviantArt (and then cringe about years later).\n\nPlus, Rob's attempt to turn Alex into his daughter is facile and ham-handed, and it shows little insight into the realities of mental illness or evil. Hitler was a strict vegetarian who was kind to his pets and servants--and he was one of the most evil men who's ever lived. Rob's nasty and one-dimensional portrayal almost tanks the entire chapter, if not the game.\nEND MAJOR SPOILERS\n\nEven with its downsides, there's still much to praise in Exhale. The "Judas" scene gave me chills. If it was a standalone game, I'd give it a thumbs down--but I'd still recommend it to people willing to brave its patchy writing.\n\nConclusion: it isn't a masterpiece, but it's worth playing. For the sequel teased at the end, I hope that the developers take what was really good about this game and leave out the not-so-good parts. There's clear talent behind The Charnel House Trilogy, and I'm excited to see it grow in the future.","April 23, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It is psychologically harrowing but presented in such a way that nothing feels cheaply done. All the characters are fully voiced (Jim Sterling is in it!), and the art is really cool.\n\nIt should be mentioned that it's a very short game and the puzzles are simple to solve, so the onus is really on enjoying the story and getting caught up in the atmosphere. If you like interactive novels or Wadjet Eye's point and click games, this is definitely worth a look.\n\nI wrote a more comlete review here: http://www.goplaythat.com/2015/04/20/quickplay-the-charnel-house-trilogy/","April 22, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved the horror theme, though it is as "scary" as point and click games go (which is very little in terms of "horror" games). I loved the story and I loved the game as a whole. However, I'm happy to say that you get the three "chapters" as one game, because that's what it felt like--one game. It's definitely a lot shorter than most point and click games of the similar kind. I completed the game with 100% achievements in less than to close to two hours (I did have the game running on idle for a bit).\n\nOverall, if you can get the game on sale (since $6 is a bit high) and if you love point and click game, I would definitely recommend this.","November 4, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a girl with a good run of bad luck in recent times who wants to escape, but soon she has to face her problems head on. Also included is the story of a man who's got more skeletons in his closet than he wants to admit. If I had to equate it with anything, It feels a lot like Kubrick's The Shining.\n\nThe entire trilogy can be beat in one sitting, and because the game is so short, what could be interesting puzzles just end up being solved because there's little else to do. There is no old-adventure-game-puzzle-solving satisfaction for solving them due to this, but it's pleasing to continue the story without too much of a break. In a way, the limited puzzles lend themselves to the maintenance of the atmosphere. There's some annoying fourth wall breaking near the start when they acknowledge some P&C tropes, but once the story really gets going, you forget about them.\n\nIt's pretty cheap. Get it cheaper if you want, but it's a good way to get through a rainy night... if you don't want to sleep, that is.\n\nP.S.

The first one, 'Inhale' introduces the character of Alex with some witty and funny lines but also with a nonsensical and idiotic monologue : this chapter is mostly basic exposition and feels pointless.\n\nThe second one, 'Sepulchre', puts you in the shoes of Harold Lang on a train. This part sets up a genuine unsettling ambiance and does a great job at raising the tension up. This is an unpersonal horror story and the setting is the monster of this chapter.\n\nThe third one, 'Exhale', stars again Alex in the same setting as 'Sepulchure' but, this time, the horror comes from Alex's life : if you don't have empathy for the character, you most certainly won't like this part. Fortunately, I began to appreciate Alex but I'd understand why 'Inhale' could set some people off. This chapter was in my opinion pretty good, with a few moments that made me go "Welp, this is a bit stupid". Still, unnerving and scary with good characters.\n\nAesthetically wise, it masters pixel art to perfection and the music, while following the prewritten path of every psychological horror movie, works fantastically. The voice actors do their part accordingly (except for Madeleine Roux when her character is supposed to be angry and Jim Sterling, whose voice can be distracting if you thank God for him.). Unfortunately, the game's pretty short and kinda felt like a teaser for the upcoming game (it outright annonced it at the end!)\n\nIn conclusion, I'd recommend it : the game is well crafted and well excecuted overall. Grab it on sale, you'll most likely enjoy this little creepy story(ies). As for me, it got me interested for the continuation of the story planned for 2016.","June 16, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved the horror theme, though it is as "scary" as point and click games go (which is very little in terms of "horror" games). I loved the story and I loved the game as a whole. However, I'm happy to say that you get the three "chapters" as one game, because that's what it felt like--one game. It's definitely a lot shorter than most point and click games of the similar kind. I completed the game with 100% achievements in less than to close to two hours (I did have the game running on idle for a bit).\n\nOverall, if you can get the game on sale (since $6 is a bit high) and if you love point and click game, I would definitely recommend this.","November 4, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game's writing, voice-acting, graphics and score are all top-notch and combine to create a chilling, compelling atmosphere not unlike the works of Stephen King (most notably The Shining, which the store definitely shares a few cues with), and while the story does end, it also provides a hint of things to come. Ultimately, this game reminds me most of a good ghost story: haunting, exciting, memorably, and bound to leave you thinking about it long after it ends.

The first one, 'Inhale' introduces the character of Alex with some witty and funny lines but also with a nonsensical and idiotic monologue : this chapter is mostly basic exposition and feels pointless.\n\nThe second one, 'Sepulchre', puts you in the shoes of Harold Lang on a train. This part sets up a genuine unsettling ambiance and does a great job at raising the tension up. This is an unpersonal horror story and the setting is the monster of this chapter.\n\nThe third one, 'Exhale', stars again Alex in the same setting as 'Sepulchure' but, this time, the horror comes from Alex's life : if you don't have empathy for the character, you most certainly won't like this part. Fortunately, I began to appreciate Alex but I'd understand why 'Inhale' could set some people off. This chapter was in my opinion pretty good, with a few moments that made me go "Welp, this is a bit stupid". Still, unnerving and scary with good characters.\n\nAesthetically wise, it masters pixel art to perfection and the music, while following the prewritten path of every psychological horror movie, works fantastically. The voice actors do their part accordingly (except for Madeleine Roux when her character is supposed to be angry and Jim Sterling, whose voice can be distracting if you thank God for him.). Unfortunately, the game's pretty short and kinda felt like a teaser for the upcoming game (it outright annonced it at the end!)\n\nIn conclusion, I'd recommend it : the game is well crafted and well excecuted overall. Grab it on sale, you'll most likely enjoy this little creepy story(ies). As for me, it got me interested for the continuation of the story planned for 2016.","June 16, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loseme/recommended/288930/","loseme","Detective Ken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loseme/","406 products in account","I may sound pretty down on this game, but I do wholeheartedly reccommend it for anyone looking for a good horror experience that doesn't rely on jumpscares... at all. You play as a girl with a good run of bad luck in recent times who wants to escape, but soon she has to face her problems head on. Also included is the story of a man who's got more skeletons in his closet than he wants to admit. If I had to equate it with anything, It feels a lot like Kubrick's The Shining.\n\nThe entire trilogy can be beat in one sitting, and because the game is so short, what could be interesting puzzles just end up being solved because there's little else to do. There is no old-adventure-game-puzzle-solving satisfaction for solving them due to this, but it's pleasing to continue the story without too much of a break. In a way, the limited puzzles lend themselves to the maintenance of the atmosphere. There's some annoying fourth wall breaking near the start when they acknowledge some P&C tropes, but once the story really gets going, you forget about them.\n\nIt's pretty cheap. Get it cheaper if you want, but it's a good way to get through a rainy night... if you don't want to sleep, that is.\n\nP.S. Jim Sterling plays a creepy neighbour and I wish he was my creepy neighbour.","June 16, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since I purchased the game at under $2 USD, I can't really complain much. For the retail price of $6 USD, I'd save your money for a longer, more interesting game. I had really hoped for more game and less grinding narrative.\n\nToo few real puzzles and a mediocre reveal make this one a don't-buy at full price.\n\nNevertheless, the score is quite good because it instills deadful foreboding. I think it's easily the best element in the entire game, and if (as the climax hints) they intend on making more in this series, they should continue with their current composition.\n\nThe art, despite being extremely limited in scope, is on par with modern p-n-c's. My estimate of the actual places you can visit includes: one apartment, a train station, and a train interior with between 6-8 largely identical compartments that alter in presentation as you progress. So, in total, there are maybe 2 dozen individually constructed environments. One additonal room pops up for narrative purposes, but it isn't interactive. Plenty of good stories have taken place in a small arena, but this is one tale that would benefit from more depth of milieu. The cramped quarters of Charnel House don't derail the game (pun), but they don't give us much variety, either. The game ends up feeling claustrophobic, though not in a good way.\n\nThe voice acting (by a handful of game professionals, no less) is technically proficient, though not particularly impressive. Sterling's addition seems like a mis-cast, perhaps. His voice is off-putting, no doubt, but it doesn't quite fit. A couple characters sound like they are talking through tin cans. Some moments that require "Oh, God, no!" sound more like "oh, gawd, noes..." These potentially exciting crescendos could have been intense and gripping, but they lose their weight when offered up in unenthusiastic, uneven presentation.\n\nPerhaps I've been spoiled by the far above-average voice direction in Wadjet Eye games, but I believe those gems are the industry standard.\n\nA great deal of the horror lies in tropetastic reveals-- for instance, sometimes the lights go out, something spooky is shown, and  the lights come back on. Some of the scary is more than mild, but it's lost in a slew of teen-horror shlock padded by the ramblings of an incoherent raconteur.\n\nCharnel House would be so much more compelling if it were simply more interactive.You will be shuttled from one room to the next, sometimes solving extremely easy puzzles, sometimes just using the right item on the right environmental object. You will find yourself with no options to explore, and you are shackled with unsubtle directions to a paint-by-numbers game.\n\nExample:\nWalk into train cabin.\nCreepy but not exactly scary thing is going on.\nCollect an item.\nLeave cabin.\nUse collected item to solve a "puzzle."\nHear a noise in the next train car.\n"Oh, maybe I should go there," narrates the viewpoint character.\nGo there.\nLights go out.\nCreepy thing happens.\nRepeat.\n\nI'm not sure why the game is divided into chapters, since it is neither long enough nor diverse enough to require compartments (pun). I understand that the viewpoint character changes, but there are better, stronger methods of offering cliffhangers than sending the player back to the main menu every 30 minutes.\n\nIn the first and third chapters, you play the same character, a snarky lady with a penchant for cigarettes and bad relationships. In the second chapter you play an archaeology professor with a drinking problem who constanly loses his train of thought (pun). Each chapter will last you about 30-45 minutes, and since I only paid $2 for ~2 hours of mildly interesting, slightly spooky game, I'm not unhappy. But, I'm not really satisfied.\n\nI wanted to jump on the train and love this game, but I think I'd rather throw myself on the tracks.\n\nP.S.

I love it!  It reminds me so much of old Sierra point&click adventure games.  Yes, it's linear but it's so well-crafted.  Not buggy and the puzzles are appropriate.  I liked the story.  The ending through me for a loop and it was great.  I saw this reviewed on Pushing Up Roses and I thought it was right.\n\nThis game is for old-school point&clock adventure gamers that want mystery and suspense.","June 5","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, okay, from about a third of the way in to finish. Me, I was mostly just annoyed. I mean, I guess they're going for a kind of "Twilight Zone" thing, but it doesn't seem to quite work out. I get that I was supposed  to feel some kind of creeping existential dread, but mostly I was afraid the whole game would be as self-referential as the first chapter. I thought maybe reading the book that keeps popping up throughout the game might help, but as near as I can tell it doesn't actually exist, so I guess that's not an option. At least the poem in the first trailer sort of makes sense now, in a way. Kind of.\nAlso, writers: If you've got a character who's lived in New York City her whole life, and is apparently voiced by the only American on your cast, maybe let the voice actress go over the script and call your attention to turns of phrase that Americans don't normally use?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: The ending will not help you make sense of the rest of it. I was really, really hoping it would.","June 4","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
