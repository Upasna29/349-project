In each room, you can light up a number of squares by touching them, and when you've lit them all, that part of the system is repaired. As you light these squares, you're given more power – enabling you to jump and teleport. Most of the puzzles rely on using that gradual increase in power to enable you to access more and more lightsquares in each room.\n\nThe art style is minimalist. So minimalist, in fact, that you can't see any of the room you're in until you touch the squares in question. As such, exploration becomes an exercise in feeling around in the dark, unsure if you're about to plunge down a hole into another room entirely, losing all your progress in the current room. That's around the point when 1000 Amps starts getting a little frustrating.\n\nIt continues to frustrate when you come up against seeminglyimpossible rooms that have conveyor belts that cart you around against your will, rogue baddies who switch off lights that you've switched on, and jumping puzzles that demand pixel-perfect precision.\n\nIt's a defiantly retro path to take, and one that isn't going to please everyone – especially when failure often means trekking back through several past rooms just to have another go. The map gives you some idea of where you're supposed to be going, but it's utterly uninteractive and therefore mostly useless.\n\nThe worst moments are when you know exactly what you need to do to solve a room, but can't quite get the timing of the jumps or teleports right, and you find yourself repeating the same move over and over again, hoping that you fluke your way into doing it right. When you do finally manage that, you won't think “Amazing! I am so talented!” – you'll think “Thank God that's over.” Then you realise that you have to start essentially from scratch in the next room.\n\nThe core idea of powering up your character progressively is a solid one, and there are moments of real beauty in the stark-but-cute art style, but ultimately 1000 Amps fails by simply not giving the player enough information, forcing a trial-and-error, guesswork-oriented approach to problem solving. That's fine when a game gives you another go instantly, but that's often not an option here.\n\nThere is an audience who'll love 1000 Amps, and the 4,99€ price is excellent value for a puzzle game of this length. But if you prefer your games to be a little more friendly and approachable, then you're going to want to look elsewhere.","November 4, 2015","true","103.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","0"

On the other side you "loose" some rooms again and again if you drop out of the border or accidently jump too high. It can be annoying during the attemps.

I'm kind of torn here, because even after cursing heavily at them, I would like to think this game's cruder problems aren't that bad.\n\n1000A is a grayscale 'metroidvania'. Everyone knows what those are. The world in this case is an "amp tree", some abstract stand-in for computer I suppose, and the player is a sort of a repair device. The graphics are a rather exciting case: everything is displayed as simple symbols! This reminds me of old Paradroid!\n\nThe controls are a little strange. You use the wsad key grid as a typical platformer setup and, surprisingly, the mouse for teleportation: click an empty part of the screen, and there you go! I haven't played an exploration game with combined controls like that before.\n\nSo, what's wrong with the game? Well, one of its unique points is that for most of the game, you are wading through levels with a very limited line of sight. Only by touching objects will you discover them. This makes for either an interesting, careful sort of gaming or a horrible chore. I thought it was mostly good, but other times when accidentally walking off the screen would reset the view, it felt like a cause for frustration and a glaring problem.\n\nAnother problem is that you can occasionally get yourself into a cul-de-sac, requiring quitting and reloading. I think the game autosaves every few cleared screens. You can tell 1000A's been designed to minimize the chance of getting stuck, but I messed up about five times during my run.\n\nThe last issue is the map layout. Sometimes the route from a to b is a ridiculously long detour: Especially for a completionist run, some of the parts of the game map read like a designed ♥♥♥♥ move: you essentially have to traverse the entire vertical span of the map once or twice too many times if you're planning to get that 100% completion.\n\nStill, 1000A was a very good little exploration puzzler. It took me about 8 hours to beat, but I did check out every screen on the map. It's definitely worth its price if you value the genre and are willing to play by this game's rules.","February 7, 2014","true","7.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

There is a mild learning curve until you learn the way the game's puzzles work, then once you get a few upgrades the levels get richer and very addictive. In particular the way adjacent rooms interact with one another was very clever, especially once the upgrades start to work together to solve rooms. The difficulty was spot on for my modest platformer skills, slightly above casual only. For achievement hunters, an easy 100% that takes a 5-7 hours maybe.\n","February 16, 2014","true","7.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

It challenges the player to use Plug's many special abilities, as well as discovering and adapting to new ones, to solve a number of different puzzles across a vast array of connected rooms. Each room is a piece of an incredibly powerful and awesome system with powered-down blocks hidden in every nook and corner. Every room permanently restored brings the player one step closer to stopping the Intruder Virus and saving the Amp Tree.

Power-ups include click-to-warp, increased touch radius, light node radar, double jump, and the ability to destroy creatures that eat light.\n\nThe game lacks a proper soundtrack, is Flash-based with slowdowns at high resolutions and, due to the open-world design, can be frustrating if you haven't found the right power-ups yet.

Upon entering each room there is total darkness, but as you come in contact with walls they illuminate, allowing you to slowly “feel” your way around. Amongst the plain walls, there are also a handful of light blocks in each room which (if you activate them all) will allow the room to be permanently lit. If you leave a room before touching all the light blocks, all of the revealed surfaces will be erased and you will have to begin again. As the game progresses you will unlock a few powers to help you clear rooms. Each power feels well spaced out and can have a major impact on how you approach each room.\nIt’s difficult to explain all the nuances of the mechanics behind 1000 Amps, but after only a few minutes playing you will understand completely. This game is beautiful, and the only gripe I have is that the map screen (an absolutely vital component of this type of game) is dreadfully vague and takes a while to figure out exactly what you’re looking at.

You have to power up rooms by lighting up all the lightpanels. They can range from a couple to a dozen.

Your little dude there, Plug, is trying to power this huge amp network back on by touching all the light blocks in every room. You have a power meter in the top right, and every block you light up charges it. This power lets you jump higher and use the abilities you unlock later like teleporting. Rooms can have anywhere from one to dozens of blocks to find, with conveyors and lifts and one-way walls and other obstacles in the way. A major strength of the game is that it is very open; once you descend from the tutorial area to the main hub, there are four paths you can take. While your guide character suggests one as the easiest, you really are free to take whichever you want, which lets you unlock powers in whatever order you want. The puzzles get pretty challenging, the powers are clever, and there's a lot of secret rooms and areas and items to uncover.\n\nI only have two real knocks against this game. The first is that the map in this game is terrible, especially when going for 100% completion. Incomplete rooms are gray outlines, complete rooms are lighter gray outlines, and the room you're in is outlined in white, all on a black background. Rooms also share borders, which makes it really tough to find those last few you're missing. My other gripe is that the final boss is a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The concept is good, but you have to fight him in four phases and the last two can be really tough. Of course, if you botch any of the phases you have to do the whole thing over. One other thing worth mentioning, I think I kinda broke the game by finding a "secret" power really early on, so the openness of the game can definitely work against the challenge factor.\n\nIt's cute and its clever and the problems don't really rear their heads until the very end, so I'd say this one is definitely worth a few hours if you have it or a few bucks if you don't.","September 21, 2015","true","2.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Personally I found it really fun: it was the game I would load up when I had less than half an hour to kill and while there are a few rooms that require you to basically smack your head against the wall until you get the perfect jump or teleport it's not particularly frustrating. The biggest negative I can think against it is that backtracking can be extremely tedious and the map was of little use since it just shows you what rooms are lit up and no actual details.\n\nOverall the game was extremely well designed and the simplistic aesthetics are a neat touch.

My first impression was that it was mediocre, kind of confusing on how you're supposed to play it and not very fun. I recently came back to it and decided to play it through to the end, and having done so, my opinion of the game has changed considerably.\n\nThe one big flaw with 1000 Amps is that the basic mechanics and general structure of how the game works and is supposed to be played can be hard to understand at first. I especially found the mechanics of how the Teleport ability exactly works difficult to grasp and had to look it up. I'm pretty sure the game explains it, but obviously not clearly enough for some.\n\nHowever, once you grasp the basics, the game starts to get pretty fun. When you understand Teleport, it gets a lot more interesting. And when you get the Sonar upgrade, the game really takes off. It's very Metroid-vania in that you're given an open world with areas you'll have to return to once you get a new ability.

Your progress in each room is only saved when you fully complete it, and it'll do things like put gaps in the floor that drop you to the room below where you're likely to walk across, holes in the ceiling that pass through to the room above where you're likely to jump, and so on, and you can't see them ahead of time because the room doesn't light up until you either explore it manually or find everything in it you need to complete it. Instead of being a game of solving good platforming puzzles, it becomes "solve good puzzles while trying to anticipate when the guy who made it was feeling like a jerk", which is not nearly as much fun.

The game world is split up into various rooms which you are tasked with restoring power to by activating all the energy node blocks in each one.  It sounds easy, but your character's jump height is tied to the % of power restored to the current room, and each room resets if you don't complete it before moving to another.\n\nAs you progress through the game you acquire new new abilities which let you deal with new obstacles the game throws in your way in metroidvania fashion.  Some rooms require quick reflexes and timing, while others just require some thinking.  Overall I found the puzzles well designed, though a few can be frustrating.  The biggest weakness though is that there are quick a few lengthy one-way passages, and if you miss completing a room in those areas, it takes a while to get back there.\n\nIt's a simple game, but a good one.

That said, there are a couple of things going on here to help separate this one from its "metroidvania" peers:\n\n- Right off the bat, there's the graphical style, which is built almost entirely on sharp, grayscale squares; it might come off as dull at a glance, but for a world built with such limited materials it actually looks pretty nice. The simple black, white, and shades in between are pleasant and clean, not to mention spiced up by the lighting, which I'll get further into in a moment.\n\n- While most platformers of this ilk immediately reveal the full layout of each room you enter, in 1000 amps the power has been cut across the entire map, so you have to feel your way around in total darkness and touch various blocks as you go to render them visible. The most important of these are "light-up" blocks, since if you find all of them in a single room the power will be permanently switched back on and that room will be "solved"; moreover, each one you find charges your battery, which enables higher jumps and the use of special abilities, so you'll often need to plan your route to complete the circuit. At this point I'll also note that there's no music to speak of until you solve a room, which prompts some manner of synthesized bell tune to pipe in; I can't say I was humming along to most of the music, but the overall effect suited me fine.\n\n- If you're looking for combat you'd best look elsewhere, since there really aren't any "enemies" wandering around in the traditional sense; actually, there aren't any dangerous obstacles here either, or any way to "die" at all. About the worst that can happen to you is that you unintentionally pass through a non-solid floor or wall into a different room and lose your progress in the one you were working on; this can be frustrating, as there's no way to tell what's where when you first enter a new area (at least until you get the Sonar, one of a few upgrades you'll need to progress past certain points), but it usually doesn't take too terribly long to get back where you were, especially if you've already solved some of the surrounding rooms and can pass through them quickly.\n\nSo there you have the game's most distinguishing features; now, how do they all fit together? For the most part, pretty well: control-wise all you need are the WASD/arrow keys to move and jump around, plus the mouse cursor to guide the crucial "teleport" ability, unlocked early on. There are a handful of technical "tricks" to discover as you get more comfortable, which are essential to giving yourself that little extra boost you need to sneak over a wall or graze past a remote light-up block; the game doesn't present too many overt hints to this end, but I'd wager that players familiar with platformers in general should be able to figure them out without too much trouble. On the whole, that's pretty much all there is to know about 1000 Amps, which is fine: you explore, you experiment, you light stuff up and fill in the map a bit at a time.\n\nPuzzle-platformer fans should enjoy themselves on the whole, but there are a handful of caveats. First and foremost, the creator's total devotion to the black-and-white art style can sometimes hamstring it: in certain situations you have to look closely to spot a less-than-obvious doorway or other element, and you'll be squinting particularly frequently at the (also grayscale) in-game map as you attempt to visually determine whether or not you missed a particular tiny passageway from way back when...and there's no way to mark or annotate it either. I can understand and appreciate sticking to one's guns artistically, but in this case I'd call it more of a hindrance than it's worth - I managed to get the completion percentage to 99% before finally giving up on figuring out which slightly-darker-than-the-rest speck on the map I'd overlooked.\n\nAlso be aware that there's no genuine transporter hub or other means of "fast travel" here: granted, the map isn't super-huge and can be traversed fairly quickly once you're breezing through solved rooms, but there are more than a few lengthy routes which can only be completed in one direction, so if you need to retrace your steps you've got no choice but to slog your way to the starting point (which can, again, be tougher to determine than it needs to be thanks to the map's deficiencies) and begin from square one. This is compounded by a couple of rooms that are particularly easy to fall out of by accident until you've turned all the lights on, and a few others which require some fairly precise tapping and clicking to clear; most of the time things feel fair and forgiving without being condescending, but there is some grumbling to be had here and there.\n\nHopefully at this point you've got a decent idea of what 1000 Amps has to offer, and what it doesn't: it's only a couple of bucks to acquire, should only take you a few hours total to finish your first time through (though I'd imagine it's ripe for speed-running once you know where you're going), and for the most part delivers on its simple, pleasant concept of a visually-sound, non-violent exploratory puzzle-platformer.

In 1000 Amps, you controls a tiny bot with the aim is to illuminate areas/rooms by simply touching or walking over boxes. These boxes are however hidden until you move up closer. There are certain upgrades in which you need to search by following a series of path, rooms to rooms, and certain rooms does require these upgrades in order to proceed. These rooms are actually interconnected to each other forming a huge map.\n\nFunny to say that I was actually attracted to this game but it gets rather frustrating after repeating the gameplay because I always come to the same area and got stuck there because I fail to get the upgrade first (teleport I believe).\n\nWithout proper upgrades, some rooms are not accessible or returnable once you missed it (and my you sure are going to miss lots of these) because you may drop pass them.\n\nThere are no minimap but there is an indication on which area you are at, but in my humble opinion, this map is rather useless. You need to restart the game once you come to a dead end and memorize the path you've taken and try on new paths. This is where it gets to you unless you have an ample amount of patients to burn.\n\nIf the above description does pique your interest do look for gameplay videos first since I don't think describe this rather thoroughly.","November 3, 2014","false","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jatopian/recommended/205690/","Jatopian","Jatopian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jatopian/","511 products in account","I was torn on whether to recommend this game, so I sat back and asked myself, "How did this game leave me feeling at the end? What was I feeling most of the time I was playing it?" And the answer to both of those questions is "frustrated and stressed"\n\nThis game is a puzzle platformer metroidvania, with both puzzle and platform elements very much intertwined. Your goal is to light up all the rooms in the game by touching all the light blocks in the rooms in one go. Near the beginning in addition to standard 2d WASD controls you also get the ability to teleport to your mouse pointer while conserving momentum, at the cost of darkening nearby blocks, so already the platforming has a pretty novel puzzle element.\n\nThe game's graphics are minimalist, but that's not a bad thing. What is bad is the minimap. For some stupid reason, it's blurry as drowned newsprint, and that makes it very difficult to hunt down all the areas you need to find and light. So that's an overarching source of irritation. Sometimes the screen will flash due to something that happened in the game, and it won't go away quick enough, and you'll miss something important and have to restart the room. The screen size is tiny and you cannot enlarge it, leading to puzzles that you could solve RIGHT NOW if the camera would just go up HALF A BLOCK, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK\n\nAhem.\n\nThe platforming takes a little time to get used to, because your jump height depends on the percentage of blocks in a given room you have succesfully lit. But you get a feel for it soon enough, and it's not a problem. What is a problem is how often you just plain fall out of a room, or get swept out of it via 'conveyor' tiles, and have to start all over again. Frustration mounts quickly, and by the time you solve a room it may feel like a hollow victory, with little payoff for the effort you invested.\n\nThis game is poison if you're a completionist in terms of game content or Achievements. Remember how I said the minimap was blurry? Well, there are two giant secret rooms you couldn't possibly miss... if they were ON the map! Instead, you have to poke at every seemingly solid wall to find them, with no clues to narrow it down. Worse yet, one of them is behind conveyor tiles, and the only way to get to it is to wait for the game to RANDOMLY BUG OUT and FAIL TO LOAD A TILE. That's right, it's a BUG that you can 100% this game. And if you do manage to find those secrets? If you found "The Tower" too EARLY in the game, YOU WON'T GET THE ACHIEVEMENT. How do you fix that? By playing the ENTIRE GAME OVER AGAIN.\n\n*sigh* In conclusion, there are some neat ideas in this game, and it has potential, but you shouldn't get it unless some things about it really change. The time you spend will leave you feeling drained, not entertained.","July 4, 2014","false","7.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Short, and mindbendingly creative, I haven't felt this driven to finish since the original Portal. Do NOT overlook this game.\n\nMade by a single man named Brandon, 1000 amps feels like the unsung indie hero of the platformer world. The jumps are smooth, there are no hitches in the graphics or glitches that ever made themselves apparent in my ample time with the game. Puzzles are smooth and organic, and even when you're stuck in a room and it's clear you can't solve it, you'll always be able to find your way out. There are only 3 major upgrades, and while I'll reserve them for spoilers, each one is a massive boon that feels perfect for the game, without breaking any of the challenge it presents, and echoes a Metroidvania feel that is always welcome in a game.\n\nAbove all else, the minimalistic monochrome art style is what stands out the most. Aesthetically, I haven't played any game like it before, and the fact that he incorporates the art style into the gameplay mechanics is quite fantastic, especially with how smooth all of it looks. While I respect all the retro 16-bit styles that have been pouring out of the woodwork, it's very refreshing sight to see an indie that has its own identity. There is very little story to speak of, but the final boss is perfect test of your acquired skills and abilities, perfectly implementing a challenging but reasonable fight for the final act.\n\nWord of warning: The one major flaw that I came across was the fact that you cannot collect the last upgrade if you use all of your insta-solve tokens on the levels before, so make sure you hold on to at least 5 until you come across the room below the infinite. It took me forever to figure out, so hopefully you won't have to.\n\nFinally, the main path is kind of obscure near the end, and while I enjoy the free roaming aspect, I found myself crossing through many of the same areas after making a wrong turn or falling into another room by accident. Other times, routes that seemed like secret paths were the correct passage to important areas, and often times if I screwed up and got lost, finding the correct passages taxed on time, for the minimap can only take you so far. Fast travel of even a limited style would've been most welcome.\n\nRegardless of these criticisms, I adore this game, and given how cheap it is just as a base product even without a sale or tied into a bundle, there is no reason for you to not pick this up, and every reason for you to bask in its glory.","November 19, 2014","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals are pleasing and the sounds fit the game well, but nothing that will really wow you. The heart of the game is in the very well designed rooms and enjoyable power mechanic.\n\nThe last couple % to get full completion can be annoying, as the world isn't easy to get around and you will have to do some backtracking to power up every room. The final boss was also very annoying and the ending was a little anticlimactic. If you aren't worried about perfect completion, then the game is pitched very well and feels very nice to work through.\n\nThere is plenty of excitement in the rooms you find.

Definitely worth $5.00.\n\nPS: for Mac users, the game uses Flash. I am told the Windows version had a better engine, but the Mac (and I believe Linux) versions are still in Flash.

There's a moderate amount of difficulty: some solutions require figuring out platforming tricks, but any puzzle that's unsolvable probably requires something you don't have yet. One problem is that you can sometimes get farther than you should along a certain path with skill, just to find yourself unable to turn around. I was lucky I saved enough seeds to get out; I might have had to restart.\n\nThe endgame is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Nothing in the game prepares you for the end boss, since that is the only fight in the game. The condescending remarks from your ally do not help.\n\nThis is a fun game worth picking up if you enjoy puzzles or Metroidvania-style platforming. It's short, but I definitely enjoyed it.","June 1, 2012","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you have found all the power in each part of the game then it will show you how to move on to the next area. Some areas of the game play into each other and can be frustrating at times if you slip or hit the wrong button.  The game plays musical rhythms while you play and find battery squares. Its a flash game which is nice because it doesn't take much to run it. The gameplay is simple but you can find yourself hitting dead ends more then you would like. You do gain skills as you progress in the game which are fun to play around with. I have enjoyed this game but not to its fullest because of how challenging some areas can get. If you want a challenge and have some times to burn then this is the game for you. Its a fun casual game for puzzle thinkers.","June 1, 2012","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/205690/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","Hmm, conflicted on this one. On one hand it has mechanics down beautifully and generally good design for each room. On the other hand it revels in the tedium of making the player replay large sections if they make a single mistake, as falling off the bottom of the screen can send you to a room you can't go back up out of. This is especially awful in the map-wide loop to unlock the final (optional) power-up, but generally an issue. The "resetting once you leave a room" bit is also mildly infuriating; maybe it factors in to the puzzles at some points, but it really feels more annoying than clever. Some rooms also really, truly rely on random luck, and I never figured out what makes conveyor belts load properly. Small nitpick but the map is kind of too small to be much help, as well, a zoomed-in option would've really been appreciated. The sound design is also cute at first but quickly becomes grating, as you will hear the poor-sounding piano pretty much everywhere.\nSo there's a lot of bad things to say about this game, definitely, but it's generally fun, all things considered. The power-ups are all useful and tend to make navigating earlier parts of the map easier. The map isn't overwhelmingly huge and the game doesn't drag on, but there's still plenty to explore. The puzzles are generally clever though there were a few instances of "jump and immediately teleport so you don't go off the top of the screen" that I reeeally did not care for. It's certainly a neat little game and I don't regret playing it, but don't expect to be blown away by it either.","July 6, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each room is "completed" in isolation, but sometimes the way rooms are connected, and the ordered in which they're solved, matters.\n\nThere are definite frustrations. It's extremely difficult to work out how to get from A to B on the world map, even with the help of the (mostly useless) minimap. This gets worse as you progress through the game.\n\nThe art style is nice and clean, though with the exception of one late-game forest area it's not particularly charming. The black-and-white style can also be wearing on the eyes - rooms constantly fade in and out as you move between them, sometimes very rapidly.\n\nOne of the bigger letdowns was the technical implementation. Being locked by 640x480 made for an uncomfortable playing experience, and I couldn't try the bundled Flash version (which I understand is plagued by its own technical challenges) because the save games are incompatible.","April 17, 2014","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This buildup is aggrivated by any attempt to play at fullscreen resolution, as well as large rooms with a lot of "conveyor belt" type blocks. However, this buildup can be periodically removed by saving and quitting to the main menu. Still somewhat frustrating, but worth it if you enjoy your puzzle-platformer goodness.","February 27, 2012","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yea it could have been fun if it wasn't run in flash, or at least had music in the background, but unfortunately those are its' two fatal flaws. The game itself is fun and original, there are some hard puzzles to solve, but the game will have you figuring out what to do by yourself soon enogh. Since I only have 4 hours played on it I'm just going to assume it eventually does have music? Especially since the promo video featured an exciting classic peice, but as I said, after 4 hours of gameplay not a single song has been played. This makes it feel like a chore to play it for longer than an hour at a time. The other major problem is that it runs in flash, so it lags constantly and doesn't like to run well at times even on great computers. Little things like this can make or break a game, and this game feels like it should be on a free flash game website, not on steam for 5 dollars.","March 1, 2012","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But that, in the end, turned out to be a plus, as it created a genuine feeling of accomplishment as Plug, your little avatar in the game, grew in power, with a genuine feeling of power once he was "fully powered up". While the difficulty in the game is pretty uneven, that's more than likely intentional, as you I've appreciated those little breaks in the current, which didn't detract from the game flow itself. Most importantly, if something isn't solvable immediately, the game will hint at that and you can always return to that place. Precision (more), timing (somewhat less), logic and, most importantly, perserverance are rewarded here. And yes, everything IS solvable - 100% finishes with every seed found and none spent are doable even on a mouseless laptop like mine (it got quite tricky at times, mind).
