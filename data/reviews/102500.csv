If you wanna some challenge in the fights and if you wanna use the nice sets and unique gear that you will find in the game (the uniques and set items are way more nice than the crafted ones, they are very stylish and have some nice stats and their own lore/description, but they don't have stats so powerful like the crafted gear), don't level up BLACKSMITHING, go for JEWELCRAFTING (to sell the jewels) and MERCANTILE so you can make a lot of money (i end up with 12 millions GOLD and wasn't even in the end of the game, i had like 25 hours or more till the final boss).\n\nTry to acquire the DLCs, Ded Kel and Teeth of Naros, they are very nice and the Ded Kel can grant you some nice things, like, you can acquire the best items for crafting (the FLAWLESS components, they grant insane stats for crafted gear) and a lot of uniques and set items (set gear) for FREE (the components are not free, but the gear that one NPC search for you is free), a NPC will get them for you.\n\nChoose well the color of the eye of your character, you won't be able to change this after, only hair and jewels and tattoos once you gain your own house (there is like 3 or 4 houses only for your character in the game).\n\nTry to do all the faction quests, they give you nice rewards and you end up meeting new NPCs and enjoying the stories.\n\nTry to level up the DETECT HIDDEN skill, it will help you a lot. Don't bother, seriously, don't bother with LOCKPICKING and PERSUASION (PERSUASION can be nice if you really want some more dialogues, but it is not necessary), LOCKPICKING is useless, really, you will find some hard chests to lockpick, but after 3 or 4 lockpicks (and you will find and will be able to afford a lot of those lockpicks) you will end up opening the chests without problem. Try to level up DISPELLING, it will help you on magic chests and will prevent you for being cursed (curses can't be removed without a HEALER, and you will be forced to travel to a city or village to lift the curse, otherwise you can continue exploring, but some curses can make your character very vulnerable, very weak).\n\nTry to read all the books you find, really, they can give you a nice understanding of the lore and they have some very interesting information, also, some of them are hilarious.\n\n***If you want more challenge, you can try to use the YSA mod, it is a mod to be used with the Cheat Engine program, it changes the game to be way more challenging, i've never used but a lot of people said that it is very well done and you can choose what to use (like, you can disable the way your character receives damage [with the mod your character receives 2x or 3x more damage from the enemies] or the XP gain [experience is reduced by default with the mod]). ***\n\n\nThere is lot of more i would like to say, but i don't remember everything now. I hope this review help you.\n\nThanks for reading.","November 27, 2013","true","158.9"," 2,146 of 2,250 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","146","2","0","21"

They add more to the game with new equipment and quests. The Weapon Bundle gives a nice helping hand for beginners, but NOT overpowered stuff.\n\nFirst thoughts on Kingdoms of AmalurI bought Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning on a 70% Sale and left the game while I played other things and wasn't feeling like giving it a try yet. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, something Torchlight-Diablo-esque perhaps.\n\nTurned out I was wrong.\n\nThe gameplayKingdoms of Amalur Reckoning has a moderately paced action packed battle where you can roll (or blink if you're a Sorcery user) to dodge and block or parry incoming attacks as long as you have the reflexes.\n\nEvery type of weapon feels unique and finding one that suits you the best might be a decisive point when you're aiming for a class (or rather, destiny). From swords to scepters, hammer to staves, bows to daggers and even chakrams, nothing is useless here. It may take some getting use to, but every weapon has its charm, its pros and cons. Every weapon has its gimmick and is impressive how different they feel, most of times a different type of weapon requires a different approach in combat.\n\nThe camera while fighting is somewhat weird, not unbearable but it can get more in your way than the enemies themselves sometimes. The game will focus on whatever hit you and sometimes if the enemy is past behind you the camera may follow him instead of keeping focus on the one you are trying to kill. This show how important is to have a lock-on option in games with such combat system.\n\nTerminate with extreme prejudiceOne of the most memorable features of Kingdoms of Amalur is something introduced early for you: Fateshift. Fateshift is the usual "super mode" you activate once you gauge is completely filled.\n\nWhy is it so memorable? The finishing moves, oh dear, the finishing moves.\n\nFew games make you feel so powerful like Kingdoms of Amalur does. When you see the first Fateshift finisher, which probably will be on a creature that is times bigger than you, you'll feel like you are unstoppable. And then you'll do it on a human sized enemy and it'll just scream OVERKILL. Nevertheless you probably won't be saving Fateshift too much because you'll want to see every last of the finisher moves, they are THAT awesome.\n\nClass building is fun, having unlimited re-specs (for a price) is betterThe game offers a lot of variety with classes and mix-ups every possible combination and you can build your character as you see fit, and if you don't like it you can re-spec as many times as you want. But keep in mind the re-specs WILL get pricey fairly quick (after the 4th re-spec you'll notice). While gold may be easy to come later on, at the beginning it surely isn't.\n\nThe usual combat approachWant to get in the face of enemy and take everything head on with heavy armor and huge melee weapons? Might is your path.\n\nMaybe you like to kill enemies at a safe distance with flashy spells? Sorcery it is then.\n\nOr do you prefer backstabs and bows? Finesse is perfect for you.\n\nHowever...\n\nMight, Finesse or Sorcery? Why choose only one?Really. Why should you become just a brutish Warrior? Why become a squishy Archer/Assassin? Why become a frail Wizard? Why when you can become a Warrior with magic, an Archer that's as deadly at long range as it is up close, or a Wizard that can use sneaky tricks if magic fails him.\n\nNot satisfied? Mix EVERYTHING. Become an Universalist.\n\nThe best of Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning is how it is possible to mix up EVERY class in the game. There are no boundaries in this game: you can mix Warrior, Thief and Wizard in any way you find better, nothing is stopping you. Doing this will often give you amusing results.\n\nOf course that "pure breed" classes will have its unique advantages and some powers that only they can access, but mixed classes often have their own bonuses that, with the right gear, will more than make up for those last skills you can't afford.\n\nStill about class buildingOne of the aspects I like the most in Kingdoms of Amalur: the complete LACK of status points. No Strenght, no Dexterity, no Intelligence to worry about, no "status puzzle" of sorts, just skill points that should be invested in the three skill three which will grant different amounts of HP and MP.\n\nA world to explore, quests to doFrom simple quests like "Kill this" to "Bring me that" to "Deliver this" to "Keep me alive" to "Save the damn world", you'll have your hands full everywhere you go.\n\nThere are long questlines from specific factions that will grant you a special reward in the end. But with a twist: most of times you have the option to join the "hero" or the "villain" (opinions may vary) of said questline, and whoever you take the side will grant a different, permanent bonus. Some choices may have a deep impact in your game.\n\nColorful, "brightful" and beautifulI normally avoid talking about graphics since opinions about it are arbitrary, but like Just Cause 2, Kingdoms of Amalur has incredible graphics and effects even on its lowest setting.\n\nSpell effects are impressive and for once the often overlooked warriors and thieves gains extremely flashy and beautiful skills and attacks to watch, which I must say, is immensely refreshing to see.\n\nComplaints, because though great, the game is very far from perfectFirst, look at any review from Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning and you'll find out that everyone says the game is too easy even on Hard. They are not exaggerating, if you pick a Might class and become a tank it won't be long until you realize enemies are barely doing a scratch on you and only the most dangerous, most powerful enemies will pose a threat to you. On the other hand playing as Finesse and Sorcery characters will require care and proper dodge/parry skills as while they can dish, they can't take as well.\n\nIndoor scenarios will seem repetitive after a while, especially cave and castle/fortresses ones, they may have different coloring, but that's about it. To make this worse the game has a tendency to grow quiet, musicless, on these areas.\n\nKingdoms of Amalur Reckoning has a decent repertory of enemies, but they are not enough. You'll encounter the same kind of enemies in several different areas from the start to the end of the game, some of the human opponents are mere re-skins of other enemies and there are even bosses who are simply overpowered enemies you'll find around, maybe with a gimmick or two, but that's about it.\n\nThe game also suffers with a problem that will show up for completionists: doing all sidequests will make you level up faster and you might end up reaching the level cap even before you travel to the last country (which is big on its own accord) which can easily frustrate people.\n\nAnother common complaint is how forgettable the main storyline is. Side quests are much more enjoyable and have many more noteworthy characters with more interesting back stories that most characters from the main story barely seems to have at all.\n\nWrapping upEven with its flaws and problems Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning is a memorable game with a lot of nice characters, nice combat system and interesting quests with a maybe not-so-great main story, but it never fails to deliver what intends to.\n\nIn the end the saddest thing is that the developer (Big Huge Games) bankrupted and we will never get newer stuff for the game like spears or even bug fixes or a new level cap. And a sequel probably will never come to a light either.","November 2, 2014","true","156.7"," 484 of 498 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","484","498","6","8"

One of the best RPG's I have ever played. It deserved to but a greater sucess than it was. Seems it was knocked off the radar with the release of Skyrim, but in many ways I find it a better game to sink time into. Combat is great fun in this game. The world is vast, beatiful and creative with lots of side quests to keep you exploring. The story line is a bit meh and could have been better.  I've put all my skill points into Sorcery which is awesome to play, and can't wait to try the others. I recomend Blacksmithing, Sagecraft, a little stealth (unless you are a Rogue, then lot's), detect hidden and persuasion. Gold is very easy to acculate in the game. Two thumbs for Kingdom of Amalur Reckoning.","November 27, 2013","true","284.2"," 424 of 472 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","424","472","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Submarine_Argument/recommended/102500/","Submarine_Argument","Submarine_Argument","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Submarine_Argument/","397 products in account","KoA: Reconing is a fantastic, underrated 3rd person, open world RPG.  The game features an excellent plot, huge world, combined with truly customizable character classes.   For those of you who don't know the story behind this game's development, it was founded by Curt Schilling (former MLB pitcher) who was a fan of games when he wasn't playing baseball.  He sunk a ton of his own money into trying to make this game (and franchise) great but in the end it was a bit too ambitious for a startup company and they went bankrupt after releasing the game.  What does this all mean?  Well, it means the game has AAA quality production values but is often overlooked.  In short, it's a hidden gem that most likely will never get a sequel, but is a really well done game.\n\nThe game's plot and setting are quite good overall.  As part of the world building, bestselling fantasy author RA Salvatore (the creator of Drizzt) wrote over 1000 pages of plot and backstory to make this world come alive.  The result is not your typical generic fantasy world, but a world with a rich history that isn't just the same old elves and orcs all over again.   I enjoyed the plot and setting of the game.  The main plot reveals rather slowly, but the last few chapters of the main plot are quite interesting.  Of course, there are TONS of sidequests and 4 full factions to explore as well, as well as two full expansions that are worth getting.\n\nGraphically, the world is very beautiful and some of the cities and outdoor settings are quite unique.   My favorite was the city of Ysa, which was built into the trees.  It's hard to get a sense of the game's graphics due to the 3rd person nature of the game.  Just looking at screenshots doesn't do it justice because your character is always standing in the middle of the screen, but when you can pan the camera around and explore the worlds, it's beautiful.  Level design is also very solid.  There's tons of areas to explore, lots of secrets, and the world map and quest system keeps you from getting lost.   My one complaint about the level design is that your character cannot jump in most places, but can only jump from certain spots.  The game's soundtrack is memorable and sound effects are also high quality, as to be expected.\n\nCombat is the main part of the game and luckily, it's very fun.  Unlike most RPGs, you truly are free to design a character that is exactly how you want to play.  You're not penalized for being a hybrid character, in fact you can prettymuch use whatever main and secondary weapons you like along with fighting styles, stealth, and magic skills.  Want to play a mage that wears robes and fights with a big hammer?  Sure, there's spells to boost your armor, heal, and a summons to help distract enemies in combat.  Want to play a stealthy assassin that uses magery to stun from afar.  Go for it!  You can also play a pure fighter, mage, or rogue and enjoy the game that way as well.  It's easy to respec your character when you want to try something different.  There's also a deep crafting system for potions, armor, and magic gems that you can get into or completely ignore.  The game also keeps the crafting skills separate from the combat skills, so you're not forced into going into blacksmithy as a warrior or gemcrafting as a mage, for instance.\n\nFighting enemies themselves is quite fun.  Most regular enemies are pretty easy to destroy, so your character feels quite powerful.  Luckily, the boss fights can be pretty difficult and are very epic!  Be prepared to mow over most weak enemies and have some challenges with the various boss fights.\n\nThe game features achievements as well and all of them work.  You can 100% the game in about 70ish hours, in one playthrough.  Luckily, there's a lack of super grindy achievements and a lot of them are fun to get.  You'll need both expansions to 100% the game, but I would highly recommend both expansions as well.  The bundle for the game goes on sale quite often, so pick up the deluxe edition!\n\nThere are a few negatives that I must mention.  The number 1 complaint about this game is that it is too easy.  If you do every faction, sidequest, and area in the main game and both expansions, you will reach the level cap far before the end of the plot.  To remedy this, I recommend playing the game on hard mode.  It does not make the game too difficult, it merely balances it out to be about the average difficulty for most games.  Even if you are someone who normally plays games on normal or even easy mode, I highly recommend playing on hard mode so that it's simply not a pushover.   I ended up playing the game for about 13 hours on medium difficulty before deciding it was too easy and starting over.  Just play it on hard to begin with.  There's also an achievment for beating the game on hard mode and if you find the game to be too challenging, you can always just level up or even lower the difficulty if you have to.\n\nThe game does feature a huge amount of optional sidequests along with 4 factions.  If you do every optional sidequest and kill every enemy that crosses your path, you will be overleveled before the end.  Therefore, I recommend doing   the main plot, all 4 factions, both DLC and a just a few sidequests.  Doing this will keep the game challenging to the end of the main story.  Also, after the main story ends you are still free to continue the game and play all of those sidequests.  The game actually has so much content that you could probably replay a second time doing only sidequests and level up to max.   It is also very easy to outmanuver enemies and run past them, which cuts down on the tedium of killing monsters that respawn after a day or two.  Another complaint I had was that the game tends to reuse enemy graphics quite a bit.  The enemies are well animated, but the game could use a bit more variety.   Finally, the last few areas of the game are pretty difficult and sort of turn into a potion swilling festival.\n\nHowever, despite these drawbacks, the game is extremely solid overall and highly recommended.  If you enjoy open world style games, this is certainly one to pickup and play.  It has a detailed plot, a well developed world, beautiful graphics, fun combat, epic and challenging bosses, a complex but optional crafting system, truly customizable classes, a variety of powerful weapon choices, and is a huge kingdom to explore for many hours.   Just play on hard mode and don't do every sidequest and you're sure to enjoy this hidden gem of a 3rd person rpg!  If you enjoyed Skyrim, chances are you will like this game.  I would even go as far to say that the combat and boss battles are better in KoA!  Give this game a chance and you'll be glad you did.","August 7, 2015","true","83.2"," 216 of 231 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","216","231","4","6"

Also, the characters have a LOT to say, and it seems that every voice (which are a lot) are all different & it brings out a lot of immersion. A lot of variety in the areas you can visit too, you have deserts, plains, marshes, canyons and what not.\n\nAlmost nothing bad about this game, perhaps sometimes a bit texture pop-in, some boring fetch quests & characters that look-a-like, but the story is thick & it has literally 1000s of side-quests. You can buy houses, explore big cities, craft & more! Everything you want in a RPG!\n\nIt has a great ton of customization that allows you to change your skills & magic abilities on the fly, always be able to go with per example a Templar - using Magic & Heavy armor, or a Sorcerer, fully magic specced with robes & chakrams (Xena's weapons!) or a Thief, wielding light weapons with hints of magic - it is literally ALL possible!\n\nThere are many weapons too, Daggers, Bows, Fae Blades, Greatswords, Hammers, Sceptres, Staffs, Chakrams, and more that I cannot remember. It has any weapon you could think of in an  - and I did not even mention the magical abilites which are very numerous & work well together.\n\nIt also has a GREAT crafting mechanic that will have you searching all corners of the world for things to use, and as I said, it encourages it. Combined with the crafting mechanic itself is also sagecrafting - that allows you to create gems to use with equipment to enhance stats.\n\nAll in all, this is probably one of the best RPGs that I have ever played.\nIt's a truly, really commendable game that every RPG lover should play!\n\nPersonal score: 9/10\n\nBest regards,\nDukhat","April 19, 2014","true","22.6"," 369 of 465 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","369","465","0","19"

See Conclusion\nNOTE: Despite my game time, I actually finished this game on the Xbox360\n\nINTRODUCTION:Kingdoms of Amalur is a single player RPG developed by Big Huge Games with 38 Studios for both Console and the PC. One of the notable personalities involved in its development is former Major League Baseball player and known avid World of Warcraft subscriber Curt Schilling, the founder of 38 Studios.\n\nThe game places you in the role of the “Fateless One”, a mysterious character who was recently resurrected back from the dead and discovers a new found power to change destiny itself. Travel the land of Amalur in search of answers on why you were recalled back into the land of the living and at the same time, learn more about a great war in the east against an immortal race called the Tuatha Deohn and why they want you dead...again.\n\nPROS:+ Beautiful Graphics, models, animation and special effects\n+ Stunning scenery, levels and environment\n+ Healthy game time that doesn't get too boring\n+ Expansive world which rewards exploration with...\n+ Good loot, item and weapon variety\n+ Fun combat regardless of the class you're playing\n+ Crafting system is deep but easy to understand\n+ Class System is VERY extensive (want to make a warhammer wielding wizard that's good with stealth? Then why not? This game lets your cross-class as much as you want.)\n+ Good enemy design and variety\n+ Lots of fun side quests (Also a CON)\n+ Fun and relatively long DLC story (Legend of Dead Kel was fun for me)\n+ Nice, straight forward story that is complicated enough to not get boring, but simple enough to follow.\n\nCONS:- Way too EASY, even on the hardest difficulty. This is possibly the BIGGEST CON of the game (There is a mod to fix this and I have provided it in the comment section below)\n- Player customization is very limited\n- Some forgettable npc characters\n- Too many side quest (Also a PRO) that levels you up too quickly even before you reach the end of the game, this results in...\n- Boredom will set in after max level, specially if you max out before the final stage\n- Money becomes irrelevant really quickly\n- Generic world and story\n- Massive map with NO MOUNT (Jogging Simulator 2011)\n\nCONCLUSION:It's a NICE RPG game that provides several hours of entertainment. If you have an itch for an MMORPG but can't be bothered with the complications of playing with other people, then this game is right up your alley.\n\nThe game boast a very beautiful and colorful art style, enjoyable levels and scenery with a fun combat mechanic. The game play gets boring at times because the difficulty curve is too easy and provides no challenge. It has a big expansive map with lots of places to explore, but gets tedious because of the lack of mount. Still, all in all, I can easily RECOMMEND this game while on sale.  If MMORPG games are Cigarettes, then Kingdoms of Amalur is the Nicotine Patch.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

Boasting hours and hours of content, it is loaded with a rich narrative and plenty of lore aspects to intrigue the fantasy buff in you.  It also has great RPG elements that will keep you striving to evolve your character. So if you enjoy that type of thing, and want to get immersed in a humongous game, then you should give this some consideration.\n\nThe graphics are absolutely charming; and the gameworld is massive, variable, and captivating. It is very fun to explore the environments in search of loot and lore.  The controls are fluid and intuitive, and the combat is exciting and flexible. And the whole experience flows very naturally, so it is the type of game that is easy to get caught up in for hours on end.\n\nThere are tons of things to do and places to explore.  There is also a myriad of lore in the game and many NPCs to have extensive dialogues with. If you enjoy delving deep into the worlds of fantasy games, you’ll have plenty to work with.  There is also a huge variety of different enemies to vanquish, so your bloodlust should be satiated as well.  There are plenty of levels to be gained, abilities to be learned, items to loot, and armor sets to (try to) complete.  And there are over 200 quests, or far more if you pick up the DLC.  In short: it is undeniably an RPG of epic proportions. Moreover, considering it can easily last 100+ hours, the developers did a good job diversifying the content so it doesn’t grow too stale towards the end.\n\nOne exceptionally cool feature of the game is that you can freely respec as often as you want and change between mage, warrior, and rouge classes (or cross-class combinations thereof).  This helps keep things fresh through the lengthy campaign, and prevents you from having to pick a single playstyle for the entire game.\n\nThere are also a couple of DLC campaigns available for Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™. They are both quite lengthy and add a very large amount of content to the experience. I definitely recommend picking up the whole package, however be prepared for a game that will take about 150 hours for completionists.\n\nSo Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ is undeniably epic, massive, and downright fun.  If you enjoy huge RPGs like Skyrim or Dragon Age: Origins then you will probably enjoy this, perhaps lesser known, but similar, game.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","April 24","true","141.8"," 108 of 117 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","108","117","2","5"

The amount of stuff to do and travel in this game is massive.  Beautiful level designs, scenery, and colors create a visual fantasy experience.  Works well for a game controller.  Voice acting is decent.  The music is pretty good, too.  The Battle of Mel Senshir was the some of the most awesomeish boss battle ever in game history.\n\n\nCons: Crazy camera angles that will leave you. Game difficulty, even on hard, is moderate to easy.  I don't think some tasks end.  The menus could be easier to navigate through. Repetitive dungeon levels.\n\n\nMajor Con: Terrible, run of the mill main story line (You're the chosen one, must save the worlf from invading army storyline) wrapped in a burrito of everyone has a fate except you, the fateless one.  The side quests had more interesting plots than the main storyline.","October 25, 2014","true","167.4"," 114 of 130 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","114","130","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mostlynice/recommended/102500/","mostlynice","Mostly Nice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mostlynice/","774 products in account","Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning\n\nI have previously played a fair amount of this on Xbox, I am pleased to confirm this is not a bad port for the PC but would be better using a controller. Overall it's good enough, and shouldn't be over-looked beacuse of the native console settings.\n\nThis game deserves the attention of any & all RPG fans, especially those who enjoy well versed fan-fiction & character art. The experience throughout the game delivers those elements not only consistently, but excellently; as well as any other I’ve played that never removed the presence of inquisition and curiosity. Delving dungeons, collecting loot – slaying mobs & basking shamelessly in NPC related debauchery. KoA:R strikes each node of the game’s fabric as a finely hit note under a bard’s fingers.\n\nKoA:R was unfortunately somewhat of a casualty, only in the sense that it did not rise above some other unnamed releases at the same time of its own decent onto the shelves. That said, those who have played the game will no doubt recommend it faster than they would other titles played in the same genre. There is a wealth of lore, items & art in the game that is unmeasurable against some of those other games you may list out next to KoA. The type that comes from the most experienced & creativity proficient in the business – combining the talents of R.A Salvatore (One of my most influential and favourite authors) & Todd McFarlane (needs no introduction) the story and the world that holds it has been extruded into an exquisite universe contained onto this game. Game developers usually spend decades writing & elevating this amount of content and lore into a functioning, well balanced & infinitely fun game. There are few areas where KoA flounders; fortunately, these areas do not impact so far as to deter the player away at any time. The inventory system\nThere are 3 schools of fighting that your hero can choose to be disciplined in; Might, Finesse & Sorcery – you are not bound to any one skill line at any time, but may want to be more heavily balanced towards one for equipment requirements. That said, a mix of 2 or even all 3 really makes the combat new and doesn’t go stale from using the same abilities and slaying enemies in a linear, uniform pattern. Each tree will grant you 3 points per level to spend freely in either tree. There’s even a respec feature in the game where you can ‘re-write’ your fate and change your play style if you grow bored or have a change of heart with your skill.\n\nThe campaign offers 10-12 hours of gameplay if you’re strictly ignoring the heaps of side-quests. Add those and DLC, there is well over 100+ hours for you to get your ample fill. Some parts become tedious as there is no great way to get around the massive map so playing systematically, almost like an MMO can wear you down as the player or give you a real grind element to the game. This will sate an itch for a lot of gamers but create black holes for others and can alter the players overall experience. On sale, this game is a steal given it has more content than many new AAA titles and belongs in a lot of gamer’s library with all the features & replay-ability.\n\n7.5/10\n","May 17, 2014","true","8.3"," 107 of 126 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","107","126","0","0"

This was the only time it was on a discount other than it was first released on Steam. I would prefer the Steam version than the Origin version because of Steam Achievies and Steam Cloud. An easy underatted game because of the the lack of discounts. Don't let that stop you though. Fun gameplay in terms of action and RPGness. Along the same lines of Fable where you create and customize your character throughout the game. Do yourself a favor and not overlook this game because of the price.

The screenshots looked nice and I am a huge RPG fan. So I bought it when it was on one of those typical Valve Season Sales.\n\nThis game is just great. It entertained me over 80 hours (well perhaps about 75 hours, the rest of my gameplay is menu idleing while reading guides or wiki). I saw many reviews comparing this with Skyrim, but be honest, they are very different.\n\nSoundtrack is very nice. Background music gives great atmosphere, but sadly there are a lot of soundbugs. I didn't hear any background music in the last 20 hours of gameplay. Sometimes sound of my characters battle voices and those of my weapons disappear. Only fix I managed to think about was restarting the game.\nThe voice acting was nice. Although there are not that many voice actors, but they were doing a good job.\n\nYou can develop your character in different ways. You can chose between three different skill trees, basicly that is the decision between Knight, Rogue and Sorcerer. But you can play any combination of those as well. Your skill tree will determine what weapons you will use. I played with the Rogue skill tree because I like stealthy approaches, and the dagger and faeblades you find are really nice and very fast. Great in combination with a bow for range attacks.\n\nYou can make tons of side quests and task. After completing the game and both DLCs I managed to complete over 200 quests (including the main quest).\n\nCombat is very repetitive. When you know how it works, it gets very very easy and you will fight almost the same every time. I played the game on hard. The first 10 levels were hard, because of bad equipment and stupidity ;) But after that it was very easy. Maybe I died 20 times during the remaing 30 levels.\n\nVery nice was the fact, that NPCs you have to follow or are your companions don't run slower than you. They run at least as fast as you, sometimes even a little faster, but they are waiting if you get too far away.\n\nThe only thing I really hated in this game was the camera. You cannot control the FOV. It adjust automatically to your current situation. Zooms out when there is an enemy far away. Gets closer if not. But sometimes this stupid camera drops below earth and all you see is dirt.\nOr in cutscenes you will see just a wall or a shoulder of a total different NPCs\n\nAll in all a very nice RPG. Go get it when it is on sale. Take your time doing all side quests and you will be entertained for a long time.","February 4","true","82.9"," 67 of 70 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","67","70","2","5"

A sad tiger is not a sight people should have to witness, but nonetheless, hear the tale of the tigers' lament. Hear the tale of the RPG that once was, and will never be. The tale of Amalur.\n\nKingdoms of Amalur was pitched as a wide, sprawling, epic world. Written by R. A. Salvatore and artwork by Todd McFarlane, this was a world where big names came together to produce an impressive, colourful vista. One where grand battles were fought, where the history of races was told in rich tapestries and stories of lore. Where gnomes were no longer the comedy option (World of Warcraft, yes, you, stop hiding in the back there, this is you I speak to at this point!). A world where the strings of fate invisibly guided everything and everyone around them, and those who could read the weave could fortell glimpses of the future.\n\nThe story revolves around the antagonist, one who has managed to unpick the very threads of fate, and the protaganist, you, similarly freed from fate, and your journey from the rags on your back (and the start which sees you unceremoniously dumped in a pile or corpses), to eventual confrontation with the evil that threatens to consume the world. The story has been told many times in many other games, but it is presented with a style and sheen that carries itself well here, the core plot quests keep a coherency and pace that maintain your interest through the rather lengthy world. Not to mention the absolute *ton* of side quests and factions you can involve yourself in, and their own stories and backgrounds, all of which are intricately details and have their own little plot twists. This is a game that prides itself on depth.\n\n... Right up until you step into it and realise that this was probably intended as an MMO. It... takes a bit of a mental adjustment to begin with, because the world, and everything in and around it, feels at first -like- an MMO made singleplayer, there's the vendors, the towns, the crafting system, in fact, so little of it feels single player tailored you'd be forgiven for asking "Where are all the other players?". Once you begin the combat however, that slowly fades into the background, combat in the game is intuitive, flashy, and visceral, with a wide variety of weapons, and a constant encouragement to alternate between magic and weapon attacks, this is a game that rewards variety and creative use of your toolset.\n\nGet over that initial mental bump however, and you'll quickly settle into a large, expansive game, with a wide and diverse world, which okay, will oft remind you that it does feel like an MMO minus the other players, but then equally it will take you places and on journeys that a lot of Roleplaying games have almost forgotten how to manage these days. It's a wonderful thing.\n\nThis unfortunately is why I am a sad tiger. The company that made this game is now bankrupt, and the assets have been sold off and everything connected to it, scattered to the four winds. There will not be a sequel, or an MMO, or any further patches or adjustments. The final product is what you get here, with a few idiosyncracies and all. It is a flawed gem, but a gem nonetheless. If you wish to get lost in a world for a few days and embark on a properly epic journey, visiting Amalur is definitely a place to consider.","March 6, 2014","true","139.5"," 100 of 120 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","100","120","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/barricadas/recommended/102500/","barricadas","Barricadas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/barricadas/","413 products in account","In 25 hours of gameplay time, I cleared out 8 regions out of 30 odd total regions. I don't feel like I'm progressing at all even though I'm at level 20. Game's original design being a MMORPG shows a lot and makes the game a huge timesink.\n\nLet's proceed to the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-Good combat with interesting skills.\n-Artsyle is pretty good and immersive.\n-Lorestones are lovely with those pretty good ballads.\n-Character faces, bodies and animations are pretty good when compared to the something like Skyrim, but it's a result of game's aesthetic design.\n-Wonderfully crafted lore by R.A Salvatore.\n-Unique items actually mean something and finding one of them is very rewarding again unlike Skyrim.\n-Skill system is intriguing and allows many versatile gameplay choices. (Although I went with full might because Amalur belongs to the Nords!)\n-A good variety of combos.\n\nCons:\n-Towns are huge immersion breakers. They consist of three buildings and people sleeping on the inn halls. Also filler NPC's that give generic answers don't sleep at all.\n-There aren't enough dialogue options and having a high persuasion skill usually means better loot for the quest. (But one time, I managed to end a quest with it. NPC said "But you had to die" I said "But I don't want to die" then he went "Oh, ok then." that was great and hilarious.)\n-Too many shallow side quests with little variety. Gets very very repetitive and that's one of the major reasons I'm done playing KoA:R.\n-Regions are connected through narrow roads and you can't discover the sides of these roads. Instead of feeling like an open world game as it aimed, it becomes a network of regions.\n-No horses, no way to go through one end of the map to the other quickly. You're dependant on fast travel.\n-Enemies that you kill on the roads spawn back too quickly and it rather becomes a tedious task.\n-Not much diversity on enemy types.\n-Enemies do not have origins. Why Kobolds are Kobolds? Why Ettin are Ettin? Is their sole purpose of being in the game is getting killed by the player?\n\nGrand Finale:\nGame is good, I can't bring myself to play to the end but for these 25 hours was pretty fun and I never felt so engaged to a game since Skyrim. But seeing that I'm at 25 hours and only completed 8 regions, I thought that I should stop. This was not a decision taken by boredom, in fact never felt boredom playing this game but it seemed like the logical thing to do. If you have time and like RPG games it's a must play. Even if you don't have enough time to complete the game you should play it for the atmosphere until you feel it becomes repetitive. For this kind of experience, this game is dirt cheap.\n\nI feel like if the dev team had time, money and it wasn't built upon a failed MMO project, it could have been a great game. Unfortunately Big Huge Games bankrupted after low sales of this game, so we're not getting any kind of sequel. It's a damn shame because the world of Amalur is so immersive and has enormous potential as an universe.","June 19, 2015","true","26.7"," 74 of 84 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","74","84","6","1"

It feels like it has borrowed something from both.  It feels like a game that was, at one point, to be grander and bigger than it ended up being; potentially interesting lore feels a bit stilted and half-told  (or, oddly sometimes OVERtold) at times, the music is occasionally good but most often forgettable.  If you've ever been really taken somewhere else by an amazing track - some of the Skyrim music, or the Nagrand themes from Warcraft, if I name two personal favourites -  you will not find that experience replicated here musically.  I found the starting area the worst as it seemed to be very limited in tracks - once I moved out into the world more, things seemed to improve.\n\nWhile it's less cartoon-like and lighthearted than Torchlight, it is far more static, less vibrant and fluid than Skyrim - but there are aspects to both that came to mind while playing this.\n\nCinematics are limited, as are camera angles, and movement over the map in general - designated "jump down spots", inability to climb over/around objects, etc. will be obvious to you if you're the kind of person who killed mounts in Skyrim until you modded them to be invulnerable, because you're going to go over the mountain YOUR way, and that's that.\n\nIn fact, you won't be on a mount at all - but in compensation, the fast travel feature is made available very early on, and the map fills up with quite a few waypoints.\n\nAs a single-player game, it's MMO roots - while generally hidden - do show from time to time, if only in the vague sense of feeling like the world feels a bit -emptier- than one might expect.   There's thankfully a dearth of overly "grindy" quests (kill 100 of this to get 50 of that), but there's also skills that feel fairly usless (crafting gems, more on that below), and make you wonder if, had this been an MMO, had there been high-end/group content, they'd have become more beneficial.\n\nMore specific comments/aspects:\n\nGeneral gameplay - the game is stable enough, but I have found more than a handful of buggy quest issues - quests that don't complete correctly and can't be fixed without a rollback to an earlier save. Items that when used, don't spawn the map point related to them, little things like that.\n\nHowever, unless you're dead set on a particular item or quest, you will find levelling in this game so fast that you WILL outlevel quests and gear very easily.  Particularly if you tend to build up your fate bar quickly, for XP gains, and/or drink experience potions - it's going to fly by.\n\nCombat - for me it's PRO OR CON, depending on what you want: combat is fun - flashy, satisfying - but I definitely would not call it challenging. The visuals are entertaining, and at times funny, and while I appreciate a game that makes you AIM attacks and spells properly, I also feel you pretty much hit the ground overpowered (at least on normal).  On the upside, being able to respec and play with talent combos is a no-brainer, and only a minor investment even fairly early on in the levels.  Improvements to the character and various perks are generously offered through quest lines, challenges, discoveries, etc.\n\nLoot - You'll end up with so many epics and set pieces that you will be bored with it after a point.  However, said loot is not all it's cracked up to be (see notes below on talents).  Weapon choices are many, loot is generous, and with the freewheeling respec potential via the fateweavers, you can easily change the entire path your character is taking anytime you see fit, just to try out something cool that's dropped.\n\nTalents -  To some extent, the talents you choose can cause the loot aspect to really fall short, because if you choose to skill up blacksmithing and gemcrafting as early as I did, it only takes a few lucky salvages for components before you're going to make gear for yourself that far, far outshines the very best drops you get, the vast majority of the time, and since there's no point in the game where you can disenchant purple/epic or yellow/set items, much of that ends up in your stash, or vendored.   You can name the gear you craft, which is occasionally entertaining.\n\nSocketing gems is something they obviously intended the player to do, as beyond a certain level, socketed items drop regularly, but even there, no item that's dropped with open sockets has come close to crafted gear, since - once skilled up - you can use gems as part of the blacksmithing process.\n\nDetect hidden is surprisingly lucrative, leading to extra gold - but also stashes of loot, secret doors, and ultimately opening up items on the map that would take time to hunt down otherwise.\n\nOne aspect that I DID find fun, and a bit more interesting (having played a rogue-type character in multiple games for years), is the stealth ability - without resorting to invisibility potions, you are forced - especially until you're skilled up - to pay real attention to the direction in which your target is facing, the patterns in which they move or change direction, etc.\n\nIn short - it's easy to learn, easy to play, generally smooth, fun to look at, and (in a good way), easy to put down. I've no regrets about buying it on sale, and while I'm not sure it screams "second playthrough", I can only give it a thumbs up for a generally entertaining - if imperfect - rpg experience.\n\nI hope that's useful to someone. Recommended, yes.","October 4, 2014","true","90.1"," 53 of 59 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","53","59","2","0"

It feels like it was designed for people who like RPG's, but want more involved action type combat. I would definitely recommend this game if you enjoy action RPG's and exploring new worlds. It's a shame that the studio went down the way they did, but this game I felt was definitely worth my time.\n\nPros:\nCombat\nLoot\nInteresting Sidequests and Stories\nLeveling System\nArt\nController support (if you like that, I played with both, it was better with PC just because of more binds I could use)\nDeep fleshed out world. I really liked the Lore in this game.\nLots of Quests ( I did every quest except for the "Collect XYZ" quests, and that took me about 60 hours.\nChoice (It's not as deep as some games, but you can make choices that have different outcomes in the world)\nBosses (Had some interesting boss fights, including the last one, although not too difficult on normal setting)\nVoice Acting (I liked the voices of the characters, although your character has no voice, I prefer it this way)\n\nCons:\nCharacter Creation/Customization (not a big deal for me personally but bare bones here)\nBugs (There are some serious bugs that ruined quest lines for me. They occur rarely, but it didn't take too much away from the experience for me)\nMain Quest Story is OK (I enjoyed it, even the end boss is pretty fun, but the epilogue after feels short and unpolished)\nCan be grindy (Lots of the quests are the same, but the stories for the side quests were often interesting and kept me wanting to get to the next town/area to find new quests and solve problems)\nCombat (Although the combat is fun, it's easy to become over powered if you figure out ways to spam certain attacks. It's not a HUGE flaw, but the balance could be better)\nVoices (Although the acting is good, you hear the same voices over and over again.)\n\nAll in all I would recommend if you're looking for an RPG to play while waiting for something else.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/102500/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","(most of my hours in this game are on Origin, not Steam)\n\nA lot of users compare this game to Skyrim, when really it is more like a single-player mix of Torchlight II and Guild Wars 2. Tons of missions, deep crafting, combo-friendly combat, a huge game-world and genuinely interesting lore means a lot of time can be spent in Amalur.\nInstalled size on hard drive (with all DLC): 11.6 GB\n\nReckoning is rather like a single-player MMO, if that makes any sense. Looting, crafting and leveling are the primary attractions. There is a ton of loot; putting points into the “detect hidden” skill reveals secret rooms and passageways that have even more loot. You'll want to loot as much as you can, even armor sets that you won't use – put points into blacksmithing, disassemble the armor and weapons you don't want to get the parts, and craft something truly epic. Leveling up provides new abilities, new special moves for weapons. At the end of each leveling session, you get to choose a “Fate Card” with special bonuses. Fate Cards are not class-specific, meaning you can use them to create a warrior mage who equips heavy armor, or an archer can wield heavy weapons, or a thief / rogue who also has some magic. There are dozens of hybrid “Fate Cards.” And if you're not happy with how your build has turned out, visit a Fateweaver to “Remix your Fate” and reset your build so you can level up again with your existing points.\n\nThe world is huge. There are a lot of places to explore with side-missions hidden everywhere. The graphics are 2012 era DirectX 9: Colorful, bright, and occasionally low-res. The general comic-book style of the artwork hides some graphical shortcomings. And on the plus side, if you have a less-than-stellar gaming PC, the game will probably run just fine. (Back in the day, I ran it on a 1GB Radeon 6670 without issues). The soundtrack by Grant Kirkhope catches the ambiance nicely. The voice acting is generally good (though your hero is silent, a la Dragon Age Origins).\n\nNot everything is excellent, unfortunately. Combat flows well, encouraging the use of different moves. Despite the many different skills and abilities at my disposal, once I found a way to dispose of mobs, I just stuck to that, and never really tried to change up my attacks. I won't say combat is easy – if you go into an area under-leveled, you'll die fast (even with potions). But once you're comfortable in the system, combat becomes just another chore. Fetch quests are repetitive. All exploration is done on foot – no horses. The dungeons are NOT copy / pasted; there's a lot of variety here. But the missions that use the dungeon and cave levels tend to follow similar patterns. If you try to do a completionist run of Reckoning, you'll need a titanic level of patience and dedication. Inventory management, frankly, s*cks. Oh, and jumping. You can't jump, except at prescribed places (“press F to jump”).\n\nKingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great game if you love messing about in an open world while worrying about plot later. If you're looking for a go-anywhere, do-anything adventure (with the freedom to jump wherever you want), you'll probably be happier with Skyrim. Or online with friends in Guild Wars 2. Sometimes, though, a solitary, easy grind for loot is exactly what you want - and exactly what Reckoning provides.\n\nOn DLC:\nThe Weapons and Armor DLC provides three complete weapons sets that are accessible at the start of the game. While great to have, the things you craft will quickly surpass them in quality and effectiveness.\n\nThe Teeth of Naros and The Legend of Dead Kel are both large additions to an already massive game. Each provides a new campaign and entirely new areas to explore. Naros in particular is a great piece of DLC. Both have a lot of content in an industry where content-laden DLC are rare. Definitely worth it to get both.\n\nNotes:\nAn EA account is NOT required. Though the game asks for an EA login on startup, you can simply click the X in the corner to skip the login. The game will play and save normally.\n\nThe company that developed Reckoning, 38 Studios, went bankrupt in 2013. The only support for the game is what you will find when trawling the forums.","November 9, 2015","true","51.5"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","41","45","2","1"

It is an absolute and criminal shame that the company who put this game together dissolved before they could make a sequel.  The story line is decadent and entertaining, and the world has been robbed of a beautiful and engaging series by virtue of developers' bankruptcy.  Still, the only extant offering in the Kingdoms of Amalur series is definitely worth the price to play.  The game devs did not reinvent the wheel with regards to the RPG genre, but their ascendency comes from the wholly customizable class system.  Ever feel limited by the restrictive class system of other games?  Ever feel like your plate-wearing badass would also have access to sneaky, sneaky rogue tactics unavailable to your class?  Ever wonder if your mage would be just as adept at wielding a swords as at wielding magicks?  KoA allows you that opportunity and more with an imaginative and unique system that rewards your playstyle, whatever that might be, and if at anytime you regret your choice, just visit one of the many fateweavers in the game and change it all, for a token sum of coin of course.  Equally inventive are the skills, which are accessible regardless what "class" you've rolled.  All skills have utility: Alchemy makes potions ranging from health and mana to enchancing various types of damage done or reducing that received, blacksmithing creates armor and weaponry for every build, sagecrafting shapes gems to enhance your gear further, and those are just the tip of the iceburg.  Persuasion is decidedly worth the investment, but lockpicking is not, as only a skill point or two will carry you through the game, particularly as lockpicks are plentiful and the minigame is not difficult.  Speaking of difficulty, anyone just picking up the game would be well served to play it on the hardest difficulty setting; I was advised by a review to do so and never regretted it, as few of the encounters will shred your nerves, even on the hard.  If you want hard, go play Dark Souls.  If you want a fun take that shows the potential of what role playing games truly could be, try KoA.  This game is vast, with tons of quests and things to do in Amalur, helping the good people (or not, if you so choose).  I've spent over 200 hours in the game thus far, and there's plenty to indulge your completionist side.  Right now I'm seeking out the few remaining achievements after my first full play through.  The ending was a little lackluster, as though they ran out of time and money to finish the game properly, but the journey itself was rewarding.  Bottom line, for what it's likely to cost you to acquire this game, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a steal, but the real theft is that it's the only one of its line.","April 6, 2015","true","232.4"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","39","43","0","0"

The main questline itself is somewhat on the short side, but when you combine it with the sheer number of side stories and quests that are available, well... I think looking at the number of hours I've spent playing it speaks for itself. It's worth noting that though this is a strictly single-player game, it has a very MMO-like feel to it.\n\nGameplay-wise, there's a LOT going on here. Firstly, you have a massive number of weapons that all offer unique styles of gameplay. Then you have a multitude of classes you can choose from, from warrior, to rogue, to mage, to any combination therof, and you can respect yourself as often as you like. One minute you can be cutting down your foes with a broadsword while hurling fireballs into their face, to sneaking up from behind and stealth-killing everyone in your path. There's so much variety and versitility offered that it's pretty much impossible to get bored. You're also offered a crafting system that is in-depth but easy to master.\n\nStory-wise, the main story is somewhat interesting but pretty generic. You play a chosen one - a hero killed from the start and brought back to life, are now unbound from fate, and has the powers of a god who can break the fates of those around them and fight against a bunch of fae who've been courrupted by demons. While the main storyline is somewhat bland, that isn't to say there isn't a lot of depth to be found.  Along the way you'll be able to take part in many optional side stories, from from becoming a member of a court of fae and learning about their culture, to unraveling the secrets of a school of magic. There's a lot of additional lore too for those who wish to dig deeper; in-game books to read, and many NPCs offer their individual thoughts and opinions on a variety of subjects.\n\nGraphics-wise, everything is beautifully rendered. Unfortunately  the world itself, while gorgeous at first, is pretty generic and gets old fast. Forests, dessert, plains, etc. Dungeons especially become visually boring and repetative. As for the audio, the voice acting is very well done and the music is very nice.\n\nIf you're a fan of action RPGs and MMOs, I highly recommend this game. If you choose to pick it up, be sure to grab its DLC as well. It's just as worth it as the main game.","December 8, 2014","true","259.5"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","34","39","0","0"

That is the case of Kingdoms of Amalur. Played it for over 230 hours and I remember thinking a while back, around mid-game, "this game is so awesome, have already 100+ hours played and still feels fresh!".\n\nThe gameplay is the secret. With its huge map and option to roam around or fast travel, you can dedicate yourself strictly to the quests, or you can explore and engage in combat whenever you like. And let me tell you, the combat is amazing, with its melee fluidity, mixed with magic powers and potions of all sorts and kinds, all very nicely implemented and presented.\n\nAdding to the variety, you can also dedicate yourself to blacksmithing, alchemy and crafting gems from shards to make even more powerful weapons, you can evolve your character adding points to a set of skills as you level up, like persuasion, lockpicking, detect hidden, stealth, and so on.\n\nReally, there's lots to do, it's a beautiful game, even considering the a bit outdated graphics (but still very nice), and the gameplay is top notch. Being a rather long game, you can feel tired and find it repetitive at times, especially in the dungeons. But even so, overall, it's a very enjoyable game.\n\nThe story, context and background are supplied through books and lorestones placed all over Amalur, as well as through contact with the NPCs. You can read it or you can skip it. Myself, I give much importance to the setting in a game and the way the story unfolds, which must be engaging. I use Bioshock and Mass Effect as benchmarks for this. In Amalur, the story is not the most important thing. The setting is rather nice, but the story sometimes unfolds too slowly and a bit confusing. The books and lore bits are often too big and boring. So, some I read, some I didn't. But this didn't hindered me from having a great experience with this game, which I did, including enjoying the story and the lore.\n\nOn the downside, like I already wrote, one can feel some repetition as the game goes, especially in the dungeons and also with the NPCs. These are very often variations of the same models. They do have different voices and behavior, which balances the look repetitiveness. Also, the boss battles that sometimes occurs are many times against more powerful variations of the NPCs and this I think could have been better, introducing a few more epic proportion battles, instead of only 2 epic bosses.\n\nFinally, you can feel overpowered very soon in the game, so, I advise playing it on hard from the beginning (with the added bonus of getting an achievement only accomplishable when starting the game on hard - doesn't work when changing difficult mid-game). And even on hard, it's not a very difficult game to master.\n\nBut hey, nothing is perfect, and kingdoms of Amalur, not being perfect, is a great game and well worth your time.","June 28, 2015","true","238.5"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/recommended/102500/","Somnambuls","D.Cosmos [lv]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/","233 products in account","It took me 125 hours to complete this game (all side quests and DLCs included)! Well, that perhaps is no match for Elder Scrolls, but, still, it's a lot of content!\n\nWhat looks and starts as just another ARPG, soon turns into immersive and beautiful open-world experience with overwhelming number of quests. And the cartoonish style is actually very beautiful, when you give it a closer look! The variety of landscapes and details – just exploring the game's world is rewarding on its own. (Take a look at my screenshots and you'll know what I'm talking about).\n\nI believe it would be fair to say that, "Kingdoms of Amalur" is "Skyrim meets Mass Effect"... just without sexy lesbian shower scenes... and without choices that actually matter.\n\nWell, about that... Choices - this aspect is actually one of the minor faults of this game. It gives the impression that you have to make moral choices that will affect your future, but (apart from few barely significant exceptions in some of the side quests) all those choices change is, whether you accept a sidequest and how the NPCs answer you. They don't affect the main storyline and don't lead to alternative endings - there are no alternative endings. On the other hand, you won't be regretting anything and wishing that you had done something differently.\n\nEspecially because you can change your class (!) at any point in the game and redistribute your skills and abilities ("skills" are boosts to your stats in this game and "abilities" are your class-specific skills). And, in this aspect, KoAR is rather unique. There are 3 traditional classes in this game: rogue, warrior and mage. Also, you can combine any two of them or all three of them. This system reminds me that of Mass Effect. The only difference is that your choice is not fixed in the beginning, but you specialise your character in one of the three directions with each next level.\n\nWhat else? Loot. There's a lot of it! But only few items are actually worth something - as always in this type of games! But, contrary to Borderlands, for example, you won't be spending as much time sorting your inventory. Just put everything you don't need to junk right away. Then you can sell it or salvage to craft new items.\n\nCrafting, exploring, potion brewing, lore stone searching (they grant stat boosts), side quests, faction quests (they grant valuable rewards in the form of cards), appearance customisation, improvement of your headquarters – there is really a lot of content in this game. And that might feel overwhelming sometimes. You just grow tired of this game, especially because at one point this game stops being challenging even on the hardest difficulty. And the enemies and battles start to feel the same. You just want to find out how everything ends. But it just doesn't. This game takes for what feels like an eternity.\n\nMy suggestion is to take breaks from time to time. Thus, when you return to it, it will still feel fresh.\n\nDon't ruin the experience for yourself! Because the story is rich and interesting, the combat system is versatile, the skill trees are complex, the numerous kingdoms of Amalur are beautiful, the sidequests are unique (well, most of them), there are various factions of enemies and the game itself offers immersive fantasy adventure experience that will take you hours to complete.\n\nIf only the graphics were more realistic, the enemies were more challenging towards the end and there was no level cap (=40), this would have been the perfect game for me.\n\nNevertheless, 10 EUR well spent.\n\nMy overall rating: 9/10","December 30, 2015","true","125.5"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","28","31","3","4"

Gameplay-wise, it's quite reminiscent of the Elder Scrolls series with a Fable style feel to the graphics.  Yeah, the landscapes and denizens are remarkably clean for an agrarian based society and it's a pig to mod but there's something inherently fun about running around a huge, open landscape weilding weapons that, in many cases, are bigger than you are.\n\nAs a lower level character there are plenty of loot drops to enable you to afford the healing, training and equipment that you're going to need to progress through the game and the merchants have unlimited funds to buy the plethora of weapons, armour and potions that are simply beneath you to use.  The real challenge is in levelling your character to the point where the abilities and skills you choose complement your gameplay style rather than feel like an adjunct.  The ability to visit a fateweaver and pay them to be able to reset all your skill & ability points is a plus...if you're unhappy with the skill trees you've chosen or if they're just not working for you...change 'em.  It's all about experimenting to find the style of combat (might, finesse, sorcery or a mixture of two or all three) that provides you with the most enjoyable playing experience.\n\nThere are plenty of dialogue options that allow you to choose the essential nature of your character...good, evil or indifferent although the opportunites to be a really nasty Dark Lord style world destroyer are too few and far between for my liking...what's the point of making a pact with a Niskaru Lord when it doesn't give you any visible benefits other than having Warsworn mercenaries trying to kill you at every turn?\n\nThe world itself is open - always a plus - and the addition of the two DLCs will allow you to run around like a headless chicken for weeks, slaughtering anything you come across that's weaker than you and getting squashed like a bug by trolls and niskaru...at least until you've got to level 20 or above at which point, you'll want to move to hard difficulty if you haven't already because it starts to get a little too easy.\n\nSide quests are plentiful and, in many cases, are more fun than the main mission.  Plenty of faction quests too, most of which are advanced tutorials in the different styles of gameplay and the careful choice of abilities & skills which is where a visit to the fateweaver to change your point allocations is a must.\n\nAll in all this game is fun to play and is one you can happily drop for a couple of weeks and then come back to without having to remember how to play it again.  It's challenging enough to keep you engrossed yet not difficult enough to be frustrating and the control and combat systems are simple to understand and use.  Voice acting is good, graphics are bright, colourful and well rendered and, despite some truly ugly or stupid looking armour sets there's not really anything negative to say about this game.  Buy it, play it, enjoy it...but tackle the DLCs after you finish the main game - you'll need a higher level character to stay alive.","November 5, 2014","true","303.6"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","38","48","0","0"

From a glance it boasts nice graphics, decent amount of content and a well-crafted combat system. However, I can assure you it’s also offers a beautiful fantasy world that has completely engrossing likeable characters with tonnes of side quest (With all DLC).  I’ll admit playing with PC controls can be somewhat challenging, however the controller settings are an utter breeze. The game has a vast range of unique weaponry and armour available, which makes every task, every hidden object, and every enemy slain feel greatly more rewarding.\n\nThe only complaint I have in relation to this game, is the item limit, it can be a royal pain when you’re collecting different sets to switch between. Aside from your abilities and destinies there are various skills to upgrade:  Alchemy, blacksmithing, detect hidden, dispelling, lock picking, mercantile, persuasion, sagecraft and stealth, which are upgradable from basic to master. These enable you to interact better within quests or be worse off depending on which you focus on. Persuasion can make all the difference when getting caught out in committing an offence against the town, as can lock picking as you’d probably guess why.\n\nWith the availability of the Fate Weaver it is easy to respec at any given time to get a different experience from the game which holds ones interest for longer than a one route only game. I wouldn’t go as far as to compare Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning to Skyrim, however, it’d definitely be my next choice from it. 8/10 Incredibly solid game.\n","February 15","true","27.4"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","2"

But about midway through the game, you start realizing how lop- sided the class options are. Stealth is nice for killing one dude, but there will always be 15 other "hive- minded" dudes in the area ready to swarm you. The mage is flashy and interesting, but you only get four real attack spells, and only one of those deserves constant use. To make matters worse, despite you having the ability to be the grand archmage of everything ever, you dont get access to any of the spells that enemies use. like teleportation across the battlefield, and auto- targeting tornadoes.  The only class ready to stand against anything is the might class. Anything close to you gets pulverized by your hammer (the only weapon option with a decent speed vs. damage output trade), and anything out of its short range gets yanked in by a hookshot. It is a powerful combo that breaks down targets that will always laugh off magic or stealth approaches. Now  for the ability sets. lock picking and spell breaking protected chests is a matter of probablility, so quick saving and loading makes points into that moot, same for stealing, so putting points into these is worthless. the only decent options are sagecraft and smithing to make decent gear, a point in persuasion ( to gain access to yet another probability game) and detect hidden to find better gear and more money.\n\nTL;DR- Get this game when it's 50- 75% off.

However, that is because it's my third PC playthrough.  I had bought it a while ago from some site, I can't even remember the name of the site anymore - and I played it through... Twice.  Then, I bought it on my Xbox 360 and played through it.  Then once I sold my 360 and bought a PS3, I bought this game and played through it AGAIN.  Now I have purchased it through Steam and am playing through it again for the 5th time.  I've also been willing to purchase this game 4 times, if that is any clue as to how great this game is.  I am so sad that the company closed after the release of this game.  Poor marketing, honestly, is the only reason it happened.  They released around the same time as Skyrim, which, is not the same gameplay or style of game at all, however, both are Fantasy RPGs, and Skyrim is the fifth game in a lineage of Elder Scrolls - one of the most popular Fantasy RPG series of our time.  That mixed with the fact that "Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning" is a very long, hard to remember name for a game - this company unfortunately fell.\n\nStory: [/b]   This story is not just some basic action story.  Sure it has it's cheesy moments, but honestly, what game doesn't?  Also, the story in this game was written by R.A. Salvatore, arguably one of the best fantasy authors of all time, certainly one of the most renowned.\n\nQuests: [/b]  Some quests do seem fairly tedious, however the amount of quests in this game, and the amount of work that went into creating all the quests is incredible.  Especially with the size of the world being what it is.   All of the characters have their own personality, and that is great.  I am a game designer myself, and just seeing all the work that was put into this game amazes me every time I play it.\n\nGameplay: [/b]  The combat in this game is unparalleled.  I have never seen a Fantasy RPG that utilizes rolling to dodge, as well as the different weights and feels of each weapon, and with essentially a "clip" of arrows for a bow, and magic, all able to be used interchangeably in the same battle blows my mind.  And the stealth kills with daggers and faeblades? Come on.  Those are probably the coolest execution kills I've seen in any game ever, save for maybe Shadow of Mordor.  But that game came out two years after (and as we all know, technology and games improve SO much in the course of even a single year).  I also love the way you twist fate in order to gain additional EXP from your kills.  The crafting in this game is incredible as well.  I love the way you can break down weapons and armor for their different pieces, and use those to craft (and name!) an entirely new weapon or armor piece.  I do wish that there was not as much level-scaling as there is, however.  And the camera angle in this game is horrendous.  Even though the world is giant, the camera angle makes you feel cramped for space throughout the whole game.  Aside from those two small things, this game is one of the most wonderful gaming experiences I have ever had.\n\nPros:\nSmooth Combat\nGreat Story\nFun Magic\nIncredible executions\nFun Quests\nAmazing Crafting\nCons:\nBad Camera Angle\nLevel-Scaling (personal dislike)\nOverall Rating: 9.5/10","January 17, 2015","true","33.0"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","21","25","3","0"

Mouse and keyboard works incredibly well after you get the hang of the camera, both weapon combos and dodging feels fluid and responsive, and melee combat is both satisfyingly visceral and very flexible. Wthin the three archetype skill trees and supporting "perks"/destinies, you can pick pretty much any playstyle you want and change it up on the fly, since respecs only cost in-game gold. I've spent at least two battles killing enemies without using any spells or weapons, but instead by dash teleporting through them - and THEN I found the teleport-slash dagger critical attack that lets you enact your favorite shameful anime samurai fantasies. It's pretty great, is what I'm saying.\n\nStory-wise, Amalur is solid but not precisely innovative; you have a lot of medieval-era peasants trying to make a living but there's a big bad and a bigger bad who want to destroy the world as you know it, and you're the Special One who'll etc etc. it gets less annoying as you get deeper into the story and find that most people don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about how special you are.

Lets say this game is bad. What alternaive do you plan to suggest? Witcher 3? Dark Souls? Baldur's Gate? Dragon Age 3? All of these alternatives are great, and you should definitely get them, but none of them can fill the niche that KoA:R belongs to.\n\nKoA:R was the only action RPG with decent combat system before Witcher 3 came, and because Witcher 3 pretty much carves its own very specific niche, KoA:R holds its position still. KoA:R excels in one other area where almost all other games in its genre falls flat: it has a vibrant and varied art style. Unfortunately the same can't be said about its story and AI.\n\nIn retrospect, if you divide the soul of RPG into four determining factors, they will be:\n1. Combat\n2. AI\n3. Art style\n4. Story\n\nThere are few RPG games that are good at one or two of these, but none that is good at at least three of them. KoA:R is special becaue it is the only one that shines in the combo { Combat, Art style }. It also tops { Combat } alongside Witcher 3 and Shadow of Mordor. Incidentally, Witcher 3 tops { Combat, Story }.\n\nKoA:R's art style might be great, but the Big Huge Engine does not live up to its name. Zones are segmented and the cities are pretty small. The battles are also not really that big. However, the world is vibrant and has a majestic feel to it. You can see when the developers ran out of budget to keep paying Todd McFarlane because Klurikorn and Alabastra are trash, and the DLCs switch to realistic art style.\n\nThere are also many minor factors like freedom of choice, crafting and potions, quality of open world, degree of role playing, etc.\n\nIf you can resist comparison with Witcher 3 and Dishonored, KoA:R has some degree of freedom of choice, but it is straightforward. Potions are boring, but crafting is awesome in this game. Every item can be dismantled into its core components, so you only grind for effect drop. Dashboarding is involved, but after finishing the Gravehal Keep, you don't even need to do that.\n\nIt is combat where this game excels. Magic, might, and stealth each is played in its own different way. Within each, every weapon type has its own set of awesome skills. You can also mix and match to your heart's content. My first playthrough had a magic build, with some rogue elements mixed into it. My second playthrough was with a pure rogue build, and it played like a totally different game. I am planning to have a third playthrough with a pure might build. Each of the three primary builds has its own faction, and for the sake of variety I suggest sticking to only your specific faction in each playthrough, (because the faction missions bring out the real fun of each playstyle).","December 7, 2015","true","204.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDanius/recommended/102500/","TheDanius","[13th] Danius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDanius/","70 products in account","What a disappointment. I wanted to like this game, I really did. I read that it was a decent RPG with good game mechanics and pretty graphics. However, in my experience, the most the game could muster from me is one giant "meh."\n\nTo start, the good points: Combat in Kingdoms of Amalur is by far it's best feature. Combat is fast, acrobatic, and exciting. Taking down mobs of enemies with a variety of weapons while dodging and firing off magic spells is an absolute highlight of this game. Controls are responsive and intuitive. Boss fights can be thrilling.\n\nThe voice acting in the game is definitely above average, if not very good. The main story quest (from what I got through) seems interesting. And the game definitely looks pretty, albeit more on the cartoony side than the likes of The Witcher or Skyrim (although that's not necessarily a bad thing.) Overall, what I read initially is not untrue; this is a decent RPG, good game mechanics, and looks pretty good.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the positives end and the disappointments begin.\n\nMost glaring is, lest you be fooled, Kingdoms of Amalur IS NOT AN OPEN WORLD ENVIRONMENT. It is a series of corridors arranged in such a way as to give the illusion of one. Resource placement within this corridored environment is lazy, with resource generating plants conveniently located periodically along the periphery of said corridors. The side quests are similarly lazy and primarily consist of fetch quests (go and kill these guys, bring me back my ring. Collect a bunch of ingredients for potions to save the town, bring them back to me.)\n\nAlso, if KoA came any closer to straight ripping off elements of Skyrim and the Elder Scrolls series of games, I think we would have had a lawsuit on our hands. Equivalents of the Fighter's Guild, Mage's Guild, and Theives Guild? Check, check, and check, Strikingly similar lockpicking mechanism/mini-game? Oh, you betcha. Alchemy, Blacksmithing, and Enchanting requiring specific workstations of each? Bingo. Hidden traps represented BY BEAR TRAPS, actuated spike tiles, and trip wires which set off various nasties. Yup. (I mean, the bear traps might have been the last straw for me).\n\nKoA also suffers from trying to cram way too much weapon and item variety into the game than is necessary. The result is the player being positively overwhelmed by the sheer volume of useless crap you pick up during play. Luckily, it provides a convenient and free fast travel mechanism to travel back to nearest towns to unload your useless junk. Oh, and that reminds me, all the towns I visited were essentially carbon copies of each other, with the various crafting stations, a pub, and a couple of random houses in each.\n\nWhile KoA definitely has it's high points -- with combat being at the absolute top -- it relies too heavily on overused RPG tropes coupled with a very heavy "borrowing" of mechanics and game elements from other titles. It suffers from the developers trying to cram WAY too much content, instead of focusing on providing a smaller, truer open world environment, innovative mechanics and quests, and overall immersive experience. In the end, as pretty as the game can look at times, what the game is lacking is originality. The leads to most quests and the search for crafting materials to feel more like chores, than fun. At only 8 hours into the game, I found myself overwhelmingly bored. And it's a shame.\n\n(IF YOU DID NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)","May 8, 2014","false","7.7"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","30","44","0","0"

Runs smoothly at (or close to) 60 FPS. Colorful, imaginative designs. You can reroll your character on the fly and try out multiple builds on one character. Combat is simple, but not awful. Reminds me of a combination of the good parts of Fable and an Elder Scrolls game. Lots of side quests and dialog options (if you want that). Fast travel AND a decent run speed make exploring not a chore.\n\nCons: Story is incredibly bland. Yet another "chosen one with no memories please save the world" snooze-fest. Every quest is a fetch quest or a "go here and activate 4 different towers and come back, thanks" deal. Random battles, as in enemies will just appear out of nowhere and attack you. That last one would be bad, but there are a lot of enemies that can fly and cast magic, so they spend most of the time hovering just outside your attack range spaming magic blasts. The menus are a slog to get through. Lore books everywhere filled with really boring, needless notes. Some of the worst fantasy names this side of Dungeon Siege 3.\n\nIf you can grab the complete edition for ~$5 and you really, really want to play another Elder Scrolls inspired game it's not a bad deal, but be warned that it is aggressivly dull underneath the pretty paintjob.","March 20","false","16.1"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","30","44","2","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/laughinggas/recommended/102500/","laughinggas","Leffles the Magnificent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/laughinggas/","1347 products in account","Perhaps one of the best Medieval Fantasy RPGs I've played in a while. The graphics are amazing, almost World of Warcraft-like. Each region is stylized differently, but follows what I think is the standard MMO style, which I don't mind, but I find it quite predictable. Gameplay, wise, the combat is really fun. Being able to transition between using a gigantic hammer and the smallest daggers is something rarely used in a few video games. The monsters are fun... for a little while. After a little while, you start noticing there's only a handful of monsters... used over... and over... and over again. Soon enough you'll find them everywhere you go. You'd probably grow tired of seeing Leanashe constantly, I know I do. The Fate powers is extremely badass, I loved using it from the start. But as you get more and more powerful weapons and spells, you may realize that the Fate powers are really only used for Bosses, not really for anything else. So chances are, you'll be playing through the game with a full Fate bar most of the time, and you won't even bother to use it. Though one thing that may ♥♥♥♥ you off the most in the game is the out-of-nowhere cutscenes that the game just pushes on you. And in the beginning, especially with the spiders, those cutscenes will scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.\n\nAs for the story, it's pretty decent, but it can become dull over time. When you realize you have badass powers to alter Fate, you feel (appropriately) like a badass. Having everyone tell you that throughout the story, it gets to the point where you just tune the story out instead of enjoying it. Thankfully, there is something that can save you from ultimately giving up on the game's story, and that would be sidequests. There's a TON of sidequests to do. Almost wherever you go, there's a handful of sidequests that needs to be done. Sure, some people don't like doing so many sidequests, but it gives me something to do when I grow bored of the storyline.\n\nThe game does have it's bugs, and I have encountered a few that have messed up a few quests for me. I haven't gone back to them, so I'm not entirely certain there's any way for them to be fixed. There are moments in the game where sound on weapons just cuts out completely, and the only thing you can hear are the after-effects of slicing at something or casting a spell. During a cutscene, the textures/models would take a moment to render as well. The last 2 bugs weren't exactly a problem for me, but they were slightly immersion breaking.\n\nTime to review the DLC! The Teeth of Naros is the shining star of the pack. An interesting land with interesting collosae people with a beautiful Greek-themed city. The story is great, and the final boss fight was truly amazing, albeit EXTREMELY difficult earlier on. The Legend of Dead Kel was a little bit less impressive. You were forced to stay on the island until later on in the DLC, so you were stuck on that same island for a while. The monsters introduced in this DLC were actually really well done. But that's the only good thing I can say about it. The story sucked. Pretty bad. Ooh, look, you're special... again. I don't want to ♥♥♥♥ on the fact that the game has you play the most important role in the main story AND the DLC stories, but really they make you so many different things, it gets confusing. But, it's not as bad as having the "You can change fate" plot point be the main thing everywhere you go. As for the armour DLC, it just gives you some starter armour. It WILL get replaced after a short while, so it's not worth having around, unless you're having a hard time finding any armour at the start.\n\nOverall, even though this game is fairly buggy, and it does get dull after a while, I still absolutely love it, for several reasons, but the biggest one would be that they made the mages INCREDIBLY badass. In most games like Skyrim, I would oftentimes have problems playing as a mage, because I feel their attacks are incredibly underpowered. But I was truly blown away at how the Mages were designed in this game. The Mage NPCs are extremely powerful, even slightly difficult to deal with since a lot of their attacks are homing. The mage abilities that you get in-game are beautiful as well. The more you progress, the more powerful your attacks actually look, and that's the most relevant in the Chakrams.\n\nSo if you haven't purchased the game, and are a fan of Medieval Fantasy RPGs, I strongly urge you to pick this game up. You'll have a ton of fun!","February 24, 2014","true","44.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

It was on sale, I like RPGs so I thought I'd give it a shot.\n\nThe first thing I've noticed or rather heard were the familiar voices from other RPGs. It was great to hear Canderous Ordo from SW: Knights of the Old Republic who gave voice to Agarth. Also you can hear Cullen's voice from DA: Origins. I've figured out more names when I was playing it but I've forgotten most of them now, it was a nice surprise though.\n\nI like the open world, and man it's huge! I've played ~100h and I still haven't discovered every location. Also, each location has different environment which is good because it doesn't get boring (well maybe except caves which are all similar).\nThe story isn't the best point in the game, the beginning is enough to get you intrigued about it but when I found out the truth I was a bit disappointed. However, a good thing was that I enjoyed every moment that led me to finishing the story. The gameplay is very good, I found it easier to play using controller, but sometimes I found it frustrating that you can only map 4 skills. However, if  you have a good feel of your character and combat it shouldn't be a big problem. Another thing that I absolutely loved about it is the possibility of mixing the skills from all trees which allows to make some interesting hybrids. It's a feature that isn't very common in RPGs.\n\nI've found some things that were frustrating for me, for example sometimes when you have a boss fight the camera behaves weirdly, and you don't see the enemy. You just have to move your character to an open space but it's annoying if it happens often. Another things is that, you have to go everywhere on foot. Yes, there is fast travel, but the areas are pretty big and sometimes I wish they've added some mounts. Sometimes it seemed to me I've spent more time walking than fighting...And, one other thing - MORE ALYN SHIR!!! I mean seriously, she was the most interesting character out of all of them and you only interact with her a few times...such a shame. Don't get me wrong, Agarth was quite cool too but...ALYN SHIR!! What can I say, I just love her voice.\n\nWhen it's on sale again, don't think twice about it, just buy it!\n\nEdit (June 2015): I've just started to play this game again and man, the camera really sucks. You'll die more times because of it than because of your skill, it can get really annoying.","October 29, 2014","true","96.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

So far, you're the only success.  You have no knowledge of your past life, and you seem to be unbound from the threads of Fate, meaning all your actions will have unknown effects on everyone else, for good or ill.  People destined to fail may succeed, those who were supposed to live may die, etc.\n\nThe game has a fair number of good points for it - you get a good range of emotions from quests and character dialog; even minor characters have been fleshed out and given personality.  The combat system is fairly simple but engaging, so it doesn't take too long to learn, but for the most part remains interesting throughout the game.  Most enemies who die in motion will drop a treasure bag, so if the body falls off the edge of a cliff or becomes inaccessible, you can still get the loot.  There are a number of quests which your decisions will actually have an overall effect on the area, as well.  More than once, someone you're sent after will go "uh hey, I have no beef with you, just those guys.  How about you leave me alone?" and you can actually work for them instead, or leave them alone.  Most of the escort quests aren't too much of a pain in the ♥♥♥, either.  The graphics are quite nice as well; the game is very beautiful, and the character models are done well.\n\nThe game definitely has its flaws, however.  A number of fluff items are tagged as essential, meaning if you pick them up, you cannot get rid of them or even leave them in your stash.  A number of quest items also remain after their use is expended, making them clog up your inventory list (or in rare cases, take up actual carrying space ).  There's no way to drop quests, and some quests are repeatable, so you'll always have their markers on your map after you've stopped caring about it.  The questflow is a bit odd as well - one branch of the main questline, and all of the faction questlines (along with a fair number of regular quests) point you to a city called Rathir fairly early (a place which marked somewhere around two-thirds to three-quarters of the game through for me), while only the other branch of the main questline went to an area called Detyre, which is much lower level than Rathir.  This wouldn't be as much of a problem is you received the Detyre quest first, but you receive it the same time as the one pointing you to Rathir, and if you've been working on any of the faction quests, you're going to be getting a huge push to go there as well.  The crafting and skill system could have used some more work as well; the lockpicking is a joke as most of the time you don't even need to move the pick, money becomes a nonissue quickly, making mercantile pointless; sagecrafting, alchemy, and blacksmithing all feel kinda useless until you max out their points.  Also, after a certain point in the game, all of the health and mana potions seem to drop back to lesser for some reason, even though the others are at the correct level... until even later in the game, when any non-health or mana potion drops are all just greater damaging.\n\nSadly, given what... happened to the company, most of the bugs will never be patched, and no sequels will be made, which is a shame 'cause despite its flaws it really is a good game.  It's definitely worth $20, and any sale price it goes to is an absolute steal.","April 22, 2014","true","101.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ottomic/recommended/102500/","Ottomic","Ottomic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ottomic/","282 products in account","Kingdoms of Amalur confuses me.\n\nIt is a game I couldn't imagine *anyone* asking for. Not in 2012, anyway, it is not a game to enter the Dragon Age and Skyrim league: Its art design is tepid and barely par for course, the story is not really that good, the UI is a consolized mess, there is no stat sheet (!!!), mod support is ZERO, there is very few skills and combat can be overly easy at times.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, this is one of the best action RPGs I've ever played, and one I've certainly played way, way past the point where I should have stopped. The best comparison I could draw with a similar game would be Fable, really, since there's a lot of elements in common with it: Quick, flashy combat, three skilltrees you can invest points in (finesse, might, sorcery), two weapons you can switch between on the fly, a few magic spells (2, until a bit further on), you'll be on your own most of the time, and combat is strictly real time. The only part the game looks a bit more developed is on the skills category, where you can find several ways to improve your adventuring and crafting abilities. The greatest achievement of this game over Fable however, is that while Fable lost itself dillydallying over customization and tattoos and farting in the face of villagers, Kingdoms of Amalur disregards all that in favor of an incredibly tight gameplay and a very flexible, if not perfect, skill tree and progression, which provides an open-ended freeform progression to the player while at the same time opening new abilities and overall feeling way meatier than Skyrim's, whose progression was more of a polite indicator that you were getting better at shooting with a bow by way of shooting more with a bow.\n\nNow, this review will be based on my 50-odd ingame hours so far. I have played with a ranged/daggers rogue complemented with some magic spells and Might talents. As you can see, I'm a kinda indecisive player, and chosen a class that's been historically looked down upon on RPGs. One, or both of those choices would have made it very difficult for me in other games: being spread too thin in Skyrim, or playing an archer on Dragon Age would make things exceedingly difficult for me. Not with KoA. There is a class that favors all-rounding. Specializing in bows doesn't mean you can't put points in swords. Or magic. And if you choose straight combat, you can utterly annihilate anything with basic combat. You can respec a pretty good number of times, too, and clever players will be able to squeeze every profession in order to get the most of them and the best equipment. But I must admit, reaching that conclusion required a bit of patience from me. The game starts very insipid and generic, and as I said, none of the first impressions I got was really that enticing, but if one can look past that, beneath the apparent simplicity and half-assedness there is an incredibly strong and extense base material: graphics are more than competent, the soundtrack is perfectly functional with moments of greatness, quests are pretty interesting if you decide to listen to them and finally, at the center of it all, the delicious, chocolatey core of it and its main driving force for me: the gameplay, and specifically, the combat.\n\nCombat is fast and flowing, camera never gets in the way and animations and attacks are very well done. All abilities have a place on it, and a lot of approaches are viable. They might say it's a game designed with a controller in mind, but I've found the keyboard layout extremely confortable (unlike in, say, Devil May Cry), and since it's way more actiony and mobile than other games', it is also extremely satisfying: even if you are decimating groups of wolves in 5 seconds flat, you'll feel like a badass doing so instead of getting bored because it's too easy. Yes, my character has 4 active offensive skills and 2 sustained ones, but I can kick so much ♥♥♥ in so many different ways between them and my ultra-powerful handcrafted equipment that it never feels old or boring. And besides, it's better to never let your guard down: it's as easy to lose half your life as leaving your guard down for a moment.\n\nTo sum it up, if you are a fan of exploring places and killing monsters I'm not just going to ask you to buy it, but to get all its DLC (especially on sale) and to be a bit patient with it. Empty your mind, shed your preconceptions and have a bit of fun with it, start doing the first missions, you don't even need to pay a lot of attention to it. Play the game for a bit, and you most assuredly will get a satisfying experience out of it. If you ever got excited about Fable, or if you are in the mood for having a good time whacking critters over the head with weapons of incredible power, pick it up without a doubt.\n\n8.5/10","June 27, 2014","true","71.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","2"

But before you grab it and get bombarded with so many skills and abilites there are some things you should know.\n\nFirst your skills, more then half are worthless and should be ignored till you have an excess to drop your endgame poitns into.\nIGNORE Lockpicking, mercantile, and stealth.\nThe Most important skill from the start is the FIND HIDDEN skill, get that to 5.\nDispell is the next skill, get that to 6 or higher, dispelling is the hardest thing about opening magicaly locked chests.\nPersuasion is a mixed bag, it won't change any major storylines, but it can lead to a few extra rewards. It's not game breaking,\nCRAFTING COMES LAST\nCrafting won't make a ♥♥♥♥ of difference till the very end end end of the game, the gear you find will be better until the very end,\nSage Crafting and Blacksmityh go hand in hand. SageCrafting can get to 6 or 8\nAlhemy can realy be ingored, up to the user but it really can be. you'll be so rich you can buy the potions you need easily,  and plenty drop.\n\n\nCLASSES, Ask yourself, do you want to blaze through the game or slowly go through the game?\nMages are FAST DEMOLITIOSHERS, WARRIORS are unkillable slow dps, you have to TRY to die as a warrior. Stealth seems nice but it's so slow you often ignore stealth kills and just go into combat, also the finesse/stea;th tree is majorly focused on bows.\n\nYou can mix and match any 2 or 3 trees for hybrid classes, but it keeps you from getting the top tier abilities in each.\n\nSuggestion, don't make your first guy a warrior, don't try to craft till your lvl 25+ Get your Find Hidden to 5 ASAP\n\nIf you don't follow those basic suggestions this game is going to be tedious and so slow in the first 8 hours you'll hate it like I first did. i went to gamefaqs and read some guides to learn what was crap and what wasn't.\n\n7.5/10\nBetter then most RPG's LOTS of play time, many ways to play, ability to fully espec into something else entirely is great, the DLC is super long. Adds 10-20 hours each on top of a 35-50 hour game. If you're a lore reader (which I am no) expec to drop 100+hours for a full completion","February 2, 2014","true","103.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","2"

And since unlocking additional weapon moves is locked in to progress down the ability trees, you spend half the game without access to the more varied attacks, meaning that most of the time you'll just be hitting your attack button and blocking/dodging occasionally.\n\nThe combat balance is almost non-existent, enemies are almost universally completely trivial other than the occasional one who is an annoying damage sponge and does hilariously disproportionate damage, and there's only about a dozen different enemies who are palette swapped and recycled throughout the course of the game. The most challenging part of the combat is dealing with the abysmal camera, which has a mind of its own and loves to zoom right in on you when you're surrounded by enemies, only stopping to clip through the scenery and get stuck under the floor occasionally.\n\nThere's a variety of non-combat skills to choose from (lockpicking, stealth, persuasion and so on) which are generally either absolutely bloody useless, or hilariously overpowered. Depending on which ones you choose you can end up completely trivialising the game without even trying, but with a little care you can max out almost all of the skills anyway which makes any sense of choice completely redundant.\n\nThe ability trees are probably the highlight of the game, there's a lot of different abilities to choose from, and thankfully you can respec your character at any time to try different things out. Depending on how you want to play, you can either go deep into one of the trees (magic, might, or finesse, which broadly correspond to the standard mage/warrior/rogue archetypes) or split your points across two or even all three trees. Putting enough points into one tree or a combination of trees unlocks "destinies" which give you added stats and bonus abilities and can make different ability builds feel very different from each other. Ultimately, however, it's still limited by the shallow nature of the combat system, and however you build your character you'll inevitably end up spamming the same basic attacks over and over again.\n\nThe real issue is with the pacing of the game. Every single town you come across is chock full of completely forgettable NPCs who will bury you up to your eyeballs in fetch quests and kill quests which give no real rewards but make you slog all over the place anyway. Either you try and do everything out of an obsessive sense of completionism, or you get bored of that by the second or third town, rush through the main quests, and realise there's really not that much game under all that padding. There are half a dozen factions with their own sidequest chains that have a bit more structure to them, but none of them really add much to the game, and aside from some minor stat boosts it makes absolutely no difference to anything whether you do them or not.\n\nOverall it's a thoroughly mediocre experience through and through, which never manages to be amazingly good or offensively bad. If you like third-person action RPG games it ticks pretty much all of the boxes, it does everything more or less adequately without ever really impressing, it all looks nice enough and there's a whole bunch of lore if you can be bothered to pay attention to it. Pick it up in a sale and it'll give you a good thirty hours or so of moderate entertainment, but it's a mostly unremarkable experience with next to no replay value.","July 17, 2015","false","39.4"," 69 of 121 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","69","121","6","0"

It has all the great elements of a great Action RPG.\n\nFirst really colorful and smooth graphics (which are designed by Todd McFarlane, creator of Spawn). World is really beautiful, characters and enemies are well animated. Graphics are well-combined with the action. You feel like you are in a feary tale.\n\nIt has a big world with lots of exploring to do. Various things to collect, many side quest to complete. So world never gets boring. Different kinds of enemies, also each town has different touches. RPG elements are satisfying and not too complicated to give you a headache. There are lots of combinations you can do with your character. Weapons and armors are fun and nice to look at. Crafting is easy to understand and your options are really wide. Especially naming your weapons are fun and makes you feel like a real hero. Combat system is brilliant, which takes you in to action.\n\nWhat are the cons? Well main story is not the greatest. Game is not that hard (it is not a con for me but seems like it is for the most people :) ). There are not mounts so travelling gets a little boring after awhile.\n\nIn the end; if you are looking for a great, rich world with colorful enemies, cool action with great graphics, this game is for you. It is basicly a great MMORPG but single player (just as I like). It is a shame developer bankrupted.

The plot was very bland and unremarkable for such a well crafted world they should have had a much more compelling plot but they didn't manage to make me care in 7 or so hours and at that point I am never going to care. The never ending fetch quests got boring very quickly, it helps move you along to new locations but it all starts to feel stale after awhile. I feel like there is some promise here and maybe when the franchise is sold to another company they can pare away all of the unnecessary nonsense, but for now there are better rpg experiences out there that you should consider way before this one.

When you first begin the game you are...dead.  But a mysterious object known as the Well of Souls brings you back to life.  When you return to the land of the living, you find yourself on a quest to discover who you are and what your destiny is.  Want to know the best part?  Unlike the complacent citizens of Amalur, you have no destiny.  As soon as you finish the tutorial/intro, you are free to explore the open world of Amalur as you please.\n\nCombat: One of Kingdoms of Amalur's strongest points is its combat system.  It is always a pleasing experience to incinerate a spider with your flaming staff or slaughter marauding bandits by impaling them on magical spikes.  Animations are very well-done and flow very smoothly.  The weapons that you can find in Amalur, while interesting, are not necessarily revolutionary.  Many times you will come across the same kind of weapons, the only difference being the perks and damage (i.e. Smoldering Longsword/Freezing Longsword/Longsword of Enhanced Sharpness).  While each weapon has its appropriate uses and does come in handy in different circumstances, the variety is somewhat lacking.\n\nGraphics: Kingdoms of Amalur has a bright, fantasy feel to it giving it a very World of Warcraft type look.  While many locations are beautiful and awe-inspiring, there are certain places that have a dull, boring look that I don't believe the developers intended.  Also, Amalur is a console port to PC, thus, many of the settings have been tweaked in order to optimize for console performance.  This means that many of the settings which could be improved on the PC (such as the foreshortened view distance) remain untouched with no way to make them look better.  However, as it is, I get a stable 60 FPS in pretty much every area with only rare spikes when loading large locations.  Overall, Amalur is quite the looker and you will not be disappointed with the atmosphere or the artistic style of the game.\n\nStoryline: The world of Amalur is vast and has many varied locations, therefore you can expect to meet many interesting, quest-giving NPCs.  From monks to a fisherman looking for his "nymph" fiancé, the variety in NPCs is incredible and I found myself too occupied by side-quests to really focus on the main story.  There are simply hours of quests to complete, each one unique and with its own purpose.  DISCLAIMER: If you do not like side-quests or non-linear storylines, then this game is NOT for you.\n\nSound: Amalur has an amazing orchestral soundtrack from upbeat combat themes to serene forest ambients to eerie dungeon music.  The music really adds to the immersion and adds to the mood of each scene.  NPC voice acting is also very well done and varied enough that I haven't found any duplicate lines in my eight hours of play so far.  The only repetitive voice-overs I have heard are the town guards which can be tiresome and annoying with their generic greetings (I'm looking at you, Skyrim >_>).\n\nConclusion: Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a masterpiece and I would recommend it whole-heartedly to you.  With 10 hours into the game so far, I am completely impressed and this game greatly exceeded my expectations (which weren't very high with the EA logo).  Kudos to the devs for making such a great game.","February 3, 2014","true","49.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I bought it because someone told me it has a massive game world and is fun to play - both of those things are true but the game world is split into pathways, so not quite as open as you'd think. A lot of the areas in the game just feel like hubs with different strands and pathways leading out into other hub areas. It's pretty weak to be honest and not a patch on something like Skyrim which feels like a vast, breathing world. The world here is dull, lifeless, populated by NPC's that are only really there to serve you. A shame, as the visual look of the environment is really lovely, but because of the design of the paths you never really get to appreciate the vast cliffs or forrests or deserts or anything.\n\nThe game boasts a metric tonne of quests, which is good, but really this just lends itself to feeling even more lifeless as it just feels like NPC's are kinda waiting around to have a chat with you about the rats in their house. Most quests are a bit of a waste of time and only the main quest line has anything worth paying attention to. I just skipped past most quest dialogue, sadly.\n\nThe combat is really fun. It operates on a combo/button combination basis and I thought it was a blast. Levelling up makes you feel genunely powerful as levelling up your different powers adds visual effects to your attacks and even special moves - it sounds gimmicky when I describe it to you here but somehow it kinda works. I had a pure mage and managed to level her to the point where I felt pretty godly. A lot of RPG's these days miss this feeling of superiority so it's nice to see a modern action RPG do this again.\n\nI guess I really enjoyed the game - I did play it for 15 hours after all but also, it kinda felt more like a 3rd person Torchlight than anything close to Skyrim or any other RPG's you like. But to be fair I just thought it was quite mediocre in places. If there was a "meh" rating i'd put that but i guess a thumbs up will have to do.","January 26, 2014","true","15.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

If they ever remake this game or create a 2nd one, they need to clean up the loot system a bit and add less, but stronger dialogue. That being said...\n\nEverything about this game is pretty damn good. The graphics are solid and unique, enemy AI is responsive, and the enemies themselves are also a lot of fun to kill. There are a variety of character builds, and the farther you go into the game, you can either specialize deeper or become a hybrid (personally went warrior-mage, you get a blink teleport). The story is interesting, with the meat of it coming from the characters around you rather than the storyline itself. The DLC is pretty solid and worth it if you really enjoyed the game, and would like to play more.\n\nThe main selling point of this game that I have left for last is just how humongous the game world is. There are around 4 or 5 continents if I remember, each with up to 15 or so subzones, with different environments, quests, etc. It is reminiscent of WoW in the way that they created the map (in a very good way).\n\nOne could say this game took elements from many different games and combined them, to which I would agree. But this is not a negative thing... the end result is that this game really doesn't have a weakness. It definitely has replay value (though I passed on that, too many games to still play...)

The strong points of this game is the amount of content it has to offer from a large selection of non-story related quests, an enormous world to experience and the huge amount of explorable dungeon like areas on offer.\n\nThe story for this game is good enough to keep you interested in the main plot, the art style and level of detail is quite lovely and the character customisation is also quite expansive from your standard crafting of equipment, enchants, potions and more to the actual skill system itself which is quite unique in the way it goes about it with fate cards.

Want a better game than Fable but with the beautiful artstyle Fable had? Check. Want a game like Skyrim, but with better combat? Huge Check. Great music? Check. Big world to explore? Check. This is one of the most underrated games of all time.\n\nI'm having a blast playing this game. The only reason it is not more popular is because it came out the same time Skyrim did. But honestly, I've had more fun with Amalur than with Skyrim mainly because of the combat. I'm not saying it's a better game than Skyrim, just that the combat is MUCH better. Seriously, the combat system is probably the best in the open world, MMO-style, western RPGs you can play. It's fun, lots of combos, a lot of versatility, awesome abilities, cool weapons, an over-powered crafting system, cool looking armor, etc.\n\nYou can easily sink over 100 hours into this game, and there's a lot to it. Lorestones with stat buffing, the crafting system is fun and easy to understand, the skill tree and the ability to combine classes adds for interesting and different combat styles, and the Threads of Fate is very satisfying to unleash on your opponent. You feel like a total badass with the seamless combat. I use a controller because it's easier to combo your main and secondary weapon, but there is a mod that allows to have your 1-8 keys set to Active Cast on your keyboard, that way pushing a key automatically casts the ability, instead of just equipping it. Whereas with a controller, you're limited to equipping a total of 4 abilties to the A,B,X,Y buttons.\n\nThe one problem people keep mentioning, which I haven't run into yet, is the game becomes very very easy. But I think that's only if you start crafting super powerful weapons, which will take time leveling up your Blacksmith ability, and getting lucky enough to find the rare components and gems to make these items. HOWEVER, there is a mod that allows you to increase the difficulty, like smaller gains in experience, enemies hit harder, less gold found, health and mana regen is much slower, etc. I might use this because the level cap is very low. I'm already at level 21 with 44 hours put into this game.\n\nBut I really love to play this game. The story is interesting, but it lacks main, memorable characters. It's a lot of NPCs with missions. I haven't been doing the main storyline yet. Just been doing sidequests because I love exploring the world and collecting items.","April 17, 2014","true","78.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RogueViserya/recommended/102500/","RogueViserya","RogueViserya","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RogueViserya/","143 products in account","Kingdoms of Amalur begins with an appealing, even charming veneer that quickly and dramatically tarnishes. At its best, it's a generic, "safe" fantasy game more reminisicent of an MMO than a single player WRPG.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nCombat is broken down into the typical RPG trio of Warrior (Might), Rogue (Finesses), and Mage (Sorcery), or a Jack of All Trades, with the option to respec whenever you want, as often as you want. From the beginning to the end, Sorcery goes from significantly stronger to hilariously overpowered, and the classes ultimately play the same, the only difference being in what particle effects you throw at the enemy.\n\nThe game plays more like an MMO than a traditional single player RPG. You drift from zone to zone, awaiting the inevitable explosion of yellow exclamation points, and there are indeed many. Too many, as a matter of fact. While one can argue that this adds more gampeplay time, it's more padding than lengthening. There's no substance to any of them, and they all play out essentially the same.\nA random loot system adds another serious deficit. Fighting your way to the bottom of an ancient ruin, behind a hidden door you may find a few mushrooms and a healing potion, while looting a random household rewards you with the ancient Deathaxe of MurderLord. It's worth noting that this randomization applies to the Blacksmithing system too, in which you salvage items for parts (Which are also completely randomzied. Epic weapons are as likely to give you worthless parts as junk weapons)to craft new ones. In theory you should be able to create weapons better than what you'd find, but you'll more likely than not find trash parts, and anything you do craft will be beaten by something you find on the side of the road.\n\nThere's little to say about the system itself. It's a very simple click-based, skill-hotbar system of combat. It's not functionally bad, it's just not very interesting, and lacks any sort of depth.\nThe game's Inventory system has to be one of the worst i've ever seen. Although there are attempts to provide organization, they are token. You are unable to sort your list-based inventory, which seems to organize itself completely at random. Items sharing the same set name may be dozens of slots away from each other. Also of note is a serious problem with many, many quest items that never lose their flagging, leaving them trapped in your inventory for the entire game.

Everyone's destiny is already known and there's nothing they can do, until a hero is awakened from the dead, the only mortal who lives again. The only one without fate, only you can change the fate of the whole world. You are limitless, what are you going to do?\n\nThe game offers you three playstyles or mix of them. Rogue, mage or warrior. I tried to play as a rogue, but it still ended as me running everywhere and shooting everyone with powerful arrows, much more useful, quicker and funnier than sneaking and backstabbing, what a shame. My only ability was always active boost on attacks. In game there are also some crafting options like blacksmithing, jewerlycrafting, alchemy and so on, but it also won't help you. I ended looting and buying everything instead of using profesion skills. The best part of the game is the story which is a little confusing I tried hard but I couln't remember all those names so I just focused on the main line and what happened in Amalur without details.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KyreMonsta/recommended/102500/","KyreMonsta","Little Sister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KyreMonsta/","81 products in account","Why have I waited so long to recommend this game? Why? I know why, because I thought, 'When I get to the end of the game, I'll have a true appreciation of it, thereby writing something from my extensive knowledge.'  Yeah, sure. At level eighteen and about sixty some odd hours in, I'm no where close to finishing. So onto my actual review:\n\nThis game is actually really good and I feel it's been overlooked. I honestly feel it is a diamond in the rough. It -is- similar to Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, but let me tell you something fascinating. I bought ES:Skyrim before I bought KOAR (Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning) and when I bought it and played it, I did -not- care for it. I was lambasted, cast out and disowned but there it is. I didn't like it. Now flash forward to spending time in Reckoning, I want to go back and play Skyrim. That's how much enjoyment I've gotten from this game. It takes me back to a place when I started playing World of Warcraft. There were these amazing characters, this fascinating storyline, beautiful artwork. This, that and the other. Eventually I fell out of love with World of Warcraft, but this game takes me back to that feeling of rolling my first character.\n\nThe combat is very user friendly. I would akin it to hack and slash, but I feel that simplifies it far too much. You have abilities, the way you unravel the fate of a foe is cinematic and enjoyable, somehow savagely satisfying.  The talent trees are easy enough to navigate. Much in the spirit of Skyrim, you can choose what you want to be and whether you want to go, might, finesse or mage, or all three or two or...you get where I'm going.\n\nThe skills are pretty neat, you have options on alchemy, a sort of jewelcrafting, blacksmithing, lockpicking, dispelling...and on and on. I wouldn't recommend lockpicking as the lockpicks are cheap, cheap and even the 'hard' chests are done simply enough.\n\nThe quests are pretty fascinating, especially the main quests. There are some side quests that will have you fetch and step bear butts but its to be expected with any sort of RPG, in my opinion. Character creation is neat, not overly detailed but enough where you get your input in. If you're expecting to spend 3 hours lost in faces, noses, ears and hair style, you will be let down. This game is not linear. You can put off the main quest indefinitely if you so wish, there are factions to join and quest for, increasing your reputations with them. There are choices to be made to decide the moral ambitions of your character, there are persuasions to attempt, assassinations to be had and endless monsters to slay until your heart is bursting with contentment.\n\nTL;DR? Does it revolutionize the RPG genre with it's intuitive and mind-blowing format? Not so much. Does it bring out some of the -best- of what we love in RPG's? I firmly say, yes. Is it worth purchasing? Absolutely. I think if you're a fan of RPG's you will find hours and hours worth of enjoyment, plus replayablitiy.\n\n8/10","March 25, 2014","true","89.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I love it too much because there isn't anything like it when it comes to PC RPGs. You can play it with an XBOX controller for an immersive experience. The graphics are beautiful without being demanding so it should run flawlessly even on older PC's.\nThe story is intriguing but there is space for more.\nYes it's inspired from Fable or Witcher but hey those are awesome games and it's not just a crappy clone ; it somehow manages to be unique and fascinating. You can get lots of hours of fun by playing this game (probably hundreds of hours) so it deserves all the attention. Too bad the studios who created this little gem are now closed. They deserved more than that.\nIt kinda reminds me of MMORPG genre but that is not a bad thing.  It's a shame that MMO's are populated by jerks and kids - that's why i prefer anytime a single player experience. Call me crazy but that is how i see things - i just want to game in peace.\nThe price is big on Steam but you get more than you pay - i got the game for free from a friend but i would have bought it without even thinking. it's A NO BRAINER!\nKingdoms of Amalur features five distinct regions, four playable races, and three class trees with 22 abilities per tree.The four playable races are the Almain (Civilized Humans), the Dokkalfar (Dark Elves), the Ljosalfar (Light Elves), and the Varani (Nomadic Humans).The player starts off as a "blank slate", but can afterwards choose a class among the three available in the game, which are called Might, Finesse, and Sorcery; they correspond to the fighter, rogue, and mage classes respectively. As the player fights and gains experience, additional levels are unlocked. With each level gained, the player gains three ability points which can be invested in the skill-tree system to unlock or augment the 22 abilities. By completing Faction quests and investing ability points, the player can also unlock various "destinies", which add positive buffs to the player.\nCombat is based on the timing of button presses, similar to an action role-playing game, with occasional quick time event cutscenes. The combat includes a 'fate' system which allows players to accumulate 'fate points' and ultimately enter 'Reckoning Mode', a slow motion mode that allows the player to quickly dispatch enemies. The Reckoning Mode may end on player's command, with the depletion of the fate bar or by the act of 'Fateshifting' an enemy. Fateshifting involves performing a brutal finishing move on a single enemy. During the cosmetic Fateshifting phase, the player may rapidly tap a random button (chosen and displayed by the game) to increase the experience yield up to 100%. After the Fateshifting, all weakened enemies also die.\nThe player can travel on land, jump down from predesignated spots and swim in the water. The player has the ability to communicate with, rob or kill NPCs; each of these actions have their own consequences. Lead combat designer Joe Quadara emphasized that "twitch skill is only going to get you so far. Strategy and proper RPG playing is going to get you farther."[5] 38 Studios founder Curt Schilling said that the style of the game would be a marriage between God of War and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.","December 28, 2013","true","212.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I haven't played many RPGs recently, having experienced more than a few failed starts in the genre. Amalur has made me excited once more to try out a new RPG.\n\nThe storytelling is excellent and the depth of the lore is very satisfying. There are even some solid gameplay elements present, with some of the combat experiences feeling quite exhilirating. It doesn't stray too far from the RPG formula, but introduces enough new gameplay elements to be interesting.\n\nAlthough the story presents the main character as being "fateless," it should be noted there is but one fate available: the one the writers intended. I don't mind, because I rather enjoy experiencing a story in this fashion. Also, this is linearity done correctly: a nuanced, cohesive and satisfying story.\n\nPlease be warned: this game is very buggy. Remember to use multiple saves and to save often, especially if you suspect you might be entering a pivotal scene in the game's storyline. More than once, I had to reset and start entire areas over because of game-breaking bugs.

Bit for bit you learn more and more about the lore, machinations of the world and all the colourful characters that inhabit it. You can go further by looking for "lorestones" across maps and reading books/scrolls that will teach you more about the Kingdom of Amalurs history, alas it is not mandatory for those who prefer to avoid lore alltogether and focus on the other aspects of the game.\nBut for those who love lore like me, you'll notice that there has been placed a lot of thought into the this aspect of the game. I'm not aware if it's R.A. Salvatore or someone else who wrote the story, but it seems well thought out in overall.\n\nSize of game-world\nThe game itself seems to be fairly large - the worldmap is quite grand & you travel between subzones on it. "Clearing" each area can sometimes take a couple of hours - so this game isn't really lacking content as to say. This game has easily 100+ hours of content to go through.\n\nQuests\nSome people voice concern that the game is too "grindy" and compare it to games like World of Warcraft where you kill x amount of wild boars, and then move on to kill x amount of kobolds, etc. Amalur has these kind of quests too, but they are well mixed among very different and personalized quests which in my opinion makes the former ones bearable to a larger extent.\n\nVisuals\nThe visuals look good, even if you find odd low-res textures here and there which isn't as bad as it might sound as long as you don't expect ultra setting Skyrim ENB with high res textures-quality. Kingdoms of Amalur can also utilize the ENB-injector technology and give the world a more vivid look which I recommend for everyone who aren't satisfied with the default visuals of the game. You can grab it off the Skyrim Nexus site.\n\nClasses\nOne of the games absolute strongpoints is the "class"-system that Kingdom of Amalur has. You have a lot of options to combine and customize your own "class" - mix and match skills of different kinds. The game has the classic "Warrior, rogue and sorcerer"-theme, but you can create hybrids of all combinations - and the ability to respecc for a sum of gold gives you a chance to try out different kinds of gameplay without having to create a new character every time.\n\nCombat\nThe combat is fast paced and fun. You unlock and learn new kinds of attacks and "combos" as the game progresses and you level up your character. The many kind of enemies and their behaviour means that you can't just spam attacks all the time (if you play on hard-difficulty), but you actually need to stop and block, or dodge attacks to be able to win. Thinking ahead is key, for example when positioning yourself so that all the enemies get in a big line infront of you, prior to using that powerful sword-attack that hits everything in a line up front.\n\nMinor flaws of the game\nMy only gripe so far with this game has been minor annoyances like the FoV (which you can modify using a widescreen modification - google it!) and things like weapons sheathing too fast, both in and out of combat. I'd like to see more RP-aspects and abilities for the character, but seeing it being a single-player game - it's forgivable. The game is also not open-world, but rather "instanced". Still the "instanced" areas are often pretty large, way larger than what Dragon Age had for instance - thus making it forgivable too.\n\nConclusion\nIn overall this game is fairly good if you're looking for decent story, engaging combat and many hours of gameplay. A little polish wouldn't hurt here and there though as I earlier mentioned. Unfortunately since the studio behind this game went into bankruptcy we can't be expecting any more updates, which is sad since the title has potential and I would personally be interested in purchasing a sequel if there ever was one.\n\nRating\nGiving this game a 8 out of 10.","February 2, 2014","true","17.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","7"

Then this game is right up your alley.  This game is right down to the core an offline MMORPG. You get tons of trash armor, there's something that reminds of dungeons, kill and fetch quests everywhere and as much action in the gameplay as you would expect of an MMORPG. While the overworld have some pretty places to look at, you rarely get much of a chance to do so since you spend most of your time inside somewhere.\n\nPositive:\n+ Combat is responsive when dodging and there's nice hit detection when hitting an enemy\n+ The armor is the game looks good\n+ Overworld is pretty and there's a lot to look at\n+ If you dig deep there's can be some fun character builds\n\nNegative:\n- Using shields in combat is absolutely unresponive and awful\n- The amount of trash equipment you get makes it a chore to find anything. You spend more time going through trash than you do comparing which weapon to use\n- Questing is VERY overwhelming in this game. You get quest, on quest, on quest, on quest.\n- Questing is completely uninspired. If you've ever played an MMORPG you probably have experience with the kinds of quest you get in this game.\n- They don't put much effort into getting you interested in the story, which is needed in this game since you get so many story side-quests. Sometimes you end up doing a quest and out nowhere find out it was apparently a huge part to the main story, but unless you're really reading and listening to every single NPC on the way you won't get anything from it.\n- I played over 10 hours and not a single hint of a mount of any kind. Wouldn't even be a little surprised if at least 5 hours of my gameplay time has been just running from dungeon to dungeon and city to city just to get filled with quests. Some cities only exists to give you quests.\n- Overworld, while pretty, feels very empty. You get the feeling of playing a dead MMORPG everywhere and it just stops the world from feeling alive at all.\n\nWith all of this said, you might find some enjoyment if you really enjoy making original character builds and mess around with that. But if you're anything like me and just enjoy some classic warrior action this game is going to bore you to tears and you're better off with Guild Wars 2, which actually is an MMORPG with an alive world and have fluid combat as well.\n\nOnly buy this game if you're starving for some wRPG action.","December 8, 2014","false","15.2"," 30 of 52 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","30","52","3","2"

Nothing that will shock you, but you can feel the certain quality that comes with a good writer.\n\nOn the downside, this game has a terrible FOV, depending on your monitor, you may end up just having your characters back over half of the screen - luckily there is an easy and fast fix called Widescreen Fixer (little program that allows you to set up your FOV and distance of the camera from your character). Another possible downer might be the very MMO-ish style of the quests and progression. You may like or dislike that, comes to personal preferences.\n\nNeutral - The game is very long. I mean it. Very long. You will likely never finish it, unless you like it as it can very easily take 100-200 hours. For me that is a plus, but I do understand some people don't fancy games of that length.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordPoet/recommended/102500/","LordPoet","Lord Poet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordPoet/","5 products in account","Summary:  I highly recommend Amalur for anyone looking to scratch that high fantasy RPG itch until the next great title comes along.  For the full purchase price of $20, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a solid purchase.  For $6 when the game goes on sale like it is now, it's a ridiculous bargain.\n\nBackground (or why my hours played is so low but the review remains relevant :P ):  I originally bought this game a month ago through Origin (don't hate, back then it was seven dollars there vs twenty here) where I clocked in over 90 hours of game time and finished the game.  Well, currently Steam has the Amalur Collection on sale for $12 that includes the core game, both DLCs and a weapon/armor bundle.  Back on Origin the DLCs cost $10 a piece so I just went ahead and bought the entire collection here.  So on to the review!\n\nPros:\n(1)  This game is massive.  And I mean MASSIVE.  I stopped doing side quests about 1/3 - 1/2 way through the game because I wanted to see how the main quest line would end, and it still took me 90 hours to finish the game.  So if you're a completionist and you decide to explore the entire map and do every single quest my guess is the game offers around 200 hours of game time.  For six dollars that's... kind of crazy.  And yes, you can continue adventuring and discover/finish side quests after completing the main story line.  :)\n\n(2)  Combat is fun and fast paced, with fluid animations, nice particle effects, and charge ups/combos galore.  There are three schools of combat skills available (basically mage, warrior, thief), but you can explore any and all of them without restriction and for a price you can respec your character any time you want through a number of vendors in the game.\n\n(3)  The voice acting is solid.  One of the worst sins a RPG can commit to kill immersion is to populate their world with terrible voice actors.  Luckily they avoid that problem here.  You might still meet the random side quest character who could have put in a little more emotion here or a bit less ham there, but all the main characters do a fine job carrying out their roles as do most of the secondary cast.\n\n(4)  The game world is well developed.  A good RPG needs an immersive game world to lose oneself in, and Amalur does a good job on this front.  First, the world lore is well fleshed out with books and lorestones (think audio books) scattered throughout the world providing history, context and even humour.  Second, the game world looks nice, especially for a two year old title.  The stylistic approach they took is very high fantasy, with colorful and vibrant settings, so if you're looking for an overall darker/perpetual winter type environment you might be disappointed.\n\n(5)  The game is stable and bug free.  In 90 hours of game play, I've only come across one bug.  Unfortunately that bug did force me to load up a previous save game to proceed in that side quest, but 1 bug in 90 hours of game play is pretty darn good.  For those who buy this game and are curious, the bug takes place right before your conversation with Sir Sagrell on the House of Ballads quest line, so just save before then and you should be golden.\n\n(6)  You get to support the state of Rhode Island!  After Steam takes its cut, proceeds from Steam sales of Amalur goes to RI, not EA.  Well, okay, if you hate the state of RI I guess this would be a con.  I've never visited RI, but as the tiniest state in the US I have a soft spot for them.  Guess it's just me rooting for the little guy.  :D\n\nCons:\n(1)  No more support.  The company that developed Amalur is bankrupt, and its assets scattered to the four winds (or RI in this case which was the company's largest creditor).  So there aren't going to be any sequels, or patches, for this game.  Ever.\n\n(2)  The camera is too zoomed in and you can't manually zoom out.  This REALLY bugged me when I first started playing this game.  The camera automatically zooms out in combat to fit all the people on the screen as well as during special attack animations, so the game is fully capable of zooming in and out.  They just decided to be lazy and not implement a manul zoom function for the PC.  -.-  After a few hours, I got used to it but chances are it's going to bug you too if you're a regular PC player (apparently this is a console port issue?).  I've read you can fix this by using Widescreen Fixer, but I haven't tried this so YMMV.\n\n(3)  The story is just adequate when it could have been so much more.  At its core, the main story itself is derivative of many other fantasy tales.  Their focus on the interplay of Desinty vs Free Will offers it a refreshing change of pace, but the game never takes that extra push to make its stories truly emotionally gripping.  For example, one of the more interesting and sympathetic characters I ran across was an antagonist who has been condemned to play the part of a villain in a never-ending, repeating fairy tale for all eternity.  So yes, she's a villain, but she's a villain who is doing these things to break the cycle where she is condemned to play the villain forever, and forever.  And while the game lets you choose her side in the end, the resolution just never reaches any kind of deeper emotional crescendo or pathos like they could have if they dug just a little deeper.\n\n(4)  The depth of your relationship with other characters are just adequate.  This, similar to the story, is an issue of wasted potential.  Like the story, the personality of the people you meet and their relationship to your character is portrayed in a perfectly adequate matter, but it never progresses beyond that.  We learn that our character had a past relationship with some of these people, but the relationships never really evolve in the here and now.  Sure some of them greet you differently after you've helped them, praise you, even call you their lord, but a true emotional connection or investment just isn't there.  Contrast this to titles like Dragon Age or Mass Effect where it was your relationships that basically made the game so great and.. well... so... much... potential... :(\n\n(5)  Some of the dungeon layouts are not very optimized for fun.  Barring its many flaws on release, one of the things Skyrim did very well was their intelligent dungeon map layouts.  Every dungeon was set out so that it would either loop in itself or end at another exit so you didn't have to track through an already cleared dungeon to leave.  Amalur does this for its main dungeons and most of the side quest ones, but they neglect to do this for a noticeable number as well which, well, is just dumb.  This might not seem like a big deal, but when you're talking about a 200 hour game with countless dungeons, it gets very annoying having to backtrack through an empty dungeon just to exit.\n\nConclusion:  All in all, this is a solid RPG romp through a well developed and entertaining land of magic and adventure.  And at six dollars, or even twenty, I would give it a solid recommendation.  So get out there, craft your own Destiny, and happy questing!  :)","February 3, 2014","true","9.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wellfuthen/recommended/102500/","wellfuthen","Wellfuthen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wellfuthen/","394 products in account","After playing it so long, i have finnaly decided to put a review in. Now, first off, this is the first game i have ever felt compelled to write a review for, so that means its something special. Now after looking at the reviews that have 180 or so hours on record, that is pretty impresive, but at the same time its not. On The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, i have about 500 hours on record, so doing the math, that would be playing for about 20 days straight without sleep. The reason why that is is the fact that you want to try out all of the different classes and combinations, and this game is very similar. The whole game is centered on fate, and that you are not effected by it (you will see why within 20 minutes of the game). Just like skyrim, you basicly choose your race, then get dropped off in a huge world and your class forges as you play. There are three ability categories: Might, Sorcery, and Finesse. wWhen you level up, you get three points to put into whatever you want. You also have destinies. When you get a certian amount of points in a single ability, or in two abiilities if you are doing a combo, you can select a destiny which will grant you addtional bonuses. You can combine destinies, (Finesse, Finesse/Sorcery, Sorcery/Might, All Three, etc...) into what every you want, and there are 6 levels of destinies for every one. There is a very helpful element to the game, and that is unbinding fate. It basicly (for a cost) resets and refunds all skill points, ability points, and destinies. This lets you make yourself the best mage in the universe to the best warrior in the universe in about 2 minutes. Unfortunatly, at the point in the game when you do this, you will have probably gotten far and there is not as much point (since you done have as much time left to play with it). You can reset your fate within 10 minutes of the game, although i went pure stealthy thief and have not unbound my fate once. I recently beat the game, at 35 hours, and am trying to unlock the last finesse destiny (you will understand when you play the game), and plan to continue with that character until i do. Speaking of the thief class, the game is hard on you closer to the end with it. You are UNSTOPABLE against a single enemy, even the final boss, the semi-final boss, and every other boss like thing was absolutely no trouble, but anytime there is more then one enemy, it gets pretty hard. Alot of the finesse (rouge/thief) class requires you to charge up your attck by holding the button down for a extra second or two, but with more then one enemy, they attck before you can do that. I have yet to play anything else, so i do not know if it is the same for the other classes or not. If you are playing just the story, you could probably beat the game within about 7 hours, but it would be incredibly hard since you would not get to a very high level. Just like other free-roam games like skyrim and far cry 3, you will be lost in the side quests before you know it. I recently showed it two one of my school friends (im in 9th grade), and after about a week of pushing, convinced her to buy it. She is only like level 5, but she said it is amazing. She described it is a skyrim like game, looking like World of Warcraft (in some ways, but i dissagree. The pictures you see above are a little better). Ultimantly, it is an amazing game definetly worth twenty dollars (i would buy it for $60), that you need to play. Even if you just play the demo to see some of the stuff i am talking about, you will probably want to buy it. It has amazing faction quests, some very fun side quests, and probably one of my favorite (if not thee favorite) story questlines. If you are still reading this, that means that this review was interesting enough, which means the game if better. There is alot of the stuff that i left out, that you just need to play to understand. I will defenetly be playing a new game of this again, and possibly even make a walkthrough, just because i love it so much. To close, i am going to say that this is my favorite game i have every played (and i have 167 games on steam, and about 40 more on the xbox) and i really hope that this review convinced you to purchase it. It is a shame that 38 Studios closed down, but i loved the game enough to really dig deep in the internet to see if there is a sequel, and there is a possibility, and buying and promotion the game will definetly increase that chance. I ask that you please buy this, and then write your own review and tell your friends. I have just spent about 1 hour and 45 minutes writing this, and it has not gone to waste. Please, buy this game and tell your friends, your will be glad you did.","May 24, 2014","true","50.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

That did not happen with this game. It’s pretty good but not great. There were good parts and bad parts and overall the good won out. The world is interesting and the graphics are nice enough. After a while though you start to notice caves repeating themselves. But this was nowhere near as bad as Dragon Age 2, there were a lot more combinations. The combat flows well and feels like you’re in control although it took a little getting used to after hours of Skyrim.  I was playing as a warrior/rogue combo so I don’t have much experience with the spell system. For the size of the world there was not quite enough enemy variety. At higher levels you just fought the same foes but with more strength and armour. Also by the time I’d reached the max level (way before I was close to the end of the story thanks to DLC areas) I was way overpowered. Combat no longer had any risk. The main quest was great but it felt very spread out. In order to fill the large world there were just so many side quests. At times it felt endless and the problem was they were very generic compared to the main storyline. Go here, kill this. Save this person. Bring me 10 things. By the end I wasn’t really listening to what people were saying anymore, just waiting for the map marker to show up letting me know what I needed to kill. I’m glad I played through it but once was enough. If you’re an RPG fan with a gap to fill it might be worth a look.","October 4, 2014","true","65.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I pre-ordered this game when it first came out and thus played it on Origin, where I still have a copy owned.  I have three full playthroughs there each with over 130+ hours played, and one has mastercrafted equipment that made me literally invincible [unless I was afflicted with Bleed status]. And a forth playthrough done "fast" with over seventy hours on it. So my time played stats here on steam should be added to those for Origin playtime of an additional 450+ hours.}\n\nThe world is accessible and vast, offering genre fans plenty to sink their teeth into. One gets the sense that they are watching an entire world unfold before them, one rich with history and lore and life. Amalur opens itself up to the player in a way that is both familiar and refreshing, then empowers the player to do incredible things.\n\nAmalur looks, plays, and feels like a great action game loaded with combos, super powers, and general badass attitude. Usability and player satisfaction were clearly at the heart of the vision for this game, and it shows. Even without a proper targeting system, your avatar quickly shifts between multiple enemies, flinging all sorts of death dealing nastiness around the battlefield. You never feel weak or hindered in combat. Enemies explode like popped pimples as you stand at the center of a hurricane of destruction.\n\nThe flexibility of the battle system is truly remarkable. You have access to three skills trees based on your standard warrior, rogue, and mage archetypes, and you assign skill points provided you meet the requirement for each allocation. This allows you to make a straight mage, a rough and tumble brawler, or any combination in between. The developers even encourage these types of cross-class creations, as statistical bonuses for your potential roguish gladiator have already been planned out. Trust me, you can play Amalur any way you want. Better still, re-specing your hero requires a rather meager amount of gold.\n\nThen there's the loot. Sweet Lord, is there a lot of loot! Reckoning plays quite similar to Diablo in many ways. You scour the countryside and find a staff that easily outclasses your current weapon of choice. Maybe you find a turban that gives a massive boost to your mana pool, or perhaps a shield able to absorb your enemies' most devastating attacks while also providing a substantial bonus to your health regeneration. The character progression and loot acquisition is enough to keep you playing, and that's something I can't really say about a lot of games out there today. In essence, Amalur serves the purpose of providing you with ways to make your virtual death machine as powerful as humanly possible. There's something reassuring about being the actual center of the universe.\n\nMechanically, Reckoning stands above most current RPG releases in interface and reliability. The menus may appear dull, but they are easily read and quickly accessed.

I played the demo when it was available and on the basis of that pre-purchased the  full version.  I am not disappointed.  It's not Skyrim, but it's got it's own charm, and  in some ways I'm enjoying playing this  as much as Skyrim. Some of the characters look cartoon like, but   the environments are beautifully rendered; not  in a realistic way, but with saturated colors which give the  game another worldly look .  The fighting in my opinion looks better than in Skyrim, with sword fights   similar to Prince of Persia or The Witcher.  The game is played in third person  but that doesn't detract from the game in any way, however I would have liked to have had a choice as sometimes first person is cool and at other times third person.  Overall I would say anyone into dungeon type  RPG's  will love this gorgeous looking game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solascientia/recommended/102500/","solascientia","SolaScientia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solascientia/","66 products in account","I'm fairly deep into the game so far.  It's very addicting.  There are some cons in terms of some of the graphics, but these honestly don't detract from the game at all.  It's very immersing and it's easy to play for hours without realizing it.  Unlike most RPGs with multiple races (Skyrim and the like, for example), whatever race you select at the beginning doesn't impact your development in the long run; they're all at an even playing field to start out.  None have any real strengths or obvious weaknesses; you can select whichever one of the four you want and not have to worry if they're going to be weaker in melee style or stealth style or whatever your preferred style is.  Using kb&m works just fine, so I have no comments as to whether a controller is any better or worse.  One other possible downside is that you need to keep a close eye on your weaponry and armor.  Depending on what you're fighting or how much fighting you're doing, your weapons (and armor to a lesser degree) will get damaged pretty quickly.  The system warns you when your weapon is close to breaking (permanently), so you'll have to use a repair kit or switch it out before it shatters.  Armor (including your shield, robes, etc) holds up pretty well.\n\nThere are a variety of destinites to choose from and you don't have to stay with one in particular; I actually recommend that you change around as more get unlocked as you level-up.  The game allows for a variety of styles without difficulty; you're not stuck with what you have and so you don't have to start over to change something.  You can see a Fateweaver to change your fate, but I've yet to see the necessity in doing that.\n\nI will say this about the difficulty levels of the game: hard/difficult mode is the way to go.  I'll admit to having some trouble with the normal mode in most other RPGs, but even KOA's difficult mode isn't overly challenging.  I rarely fateshift unless I'm coming up against a foe I just can't figure out how to beat, or if I don't have enough health potions.  Levelling up is pretty easy compared to other games.  It's a very entertaining game and it being a little easier in terms of foes allows for better exploration, in my opinion.  I have been doing the side quests and faction quests as I go rather than coming back to them, but it doesn't seem to matter how you do it.  That being said, I'm sure I'm progressing slower than others might, and I've got a ways to go before actually completing the game (I've put the main quests on hold for the moment to do some exploring in areas I've not been to).","October 31, 2014","true","194.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's one of my favorites to play.\nWhen I first started playing it, my very first impressions were, 'ok this is nice, kind of like Skyrims poorer cousin', but the more I played the more I realized how unfair that initial thought was.\n\nThe combat is very fluid, with a great feeling of impact to the hits. All the moves and spells are beautifully animated.\nI've gone pure warrior on my first character and can't wait to try out the pure caster role as I think it will be different and interesting to play. Rogue types are normally my least fave to play, but the combat is so enjoyable I'm even looking forward to trying that out too.\n\nLoads of side quests (I'm aiming to do all of them on my first character.)\n\nThe world is huge and very nicely done. There are invisible walls but the world is very open and I don't find they get in the way so they're not something to worry about and they've included jump off points at locations where you'd need/want them.\n\nThe dungeons are great fun too. Loads of loot drops and chests in dungeons and around the world. The weapons and armor are all really nicely meshed and textured as well.\n\nThe only negative thing I'd say about the world is that there's something not quite right with the ...ambience? When your outside it feels like you're inside, I haven't been able to put my finger on why that is though, maybe the sounds or something. It's not game breaking, just a little weird when you first start playing, it doesn't bother me at all now.\n\nThe herbing animations are beautiful, which I think shows a really nice attention to detail.\nThe professions in general are all really good and all worth having. The only thing is when your salvaging armor and weapons it can be a bit awkward. It's fine if you only carry round stuff you have equipped and are going to salvage or sell everything else, but I 'collect' stuff, so I'm constantly having to flick back to my inventory and then back to the salvage screen to make sure I'm not salvaging anything I intended to keep. I feel if you could have salvaged directly from your junk inventory that would have been much better. But that's the only negative thing I have to say about this game at all, and overall and compared to everything else they got right, it's not at all important, just inconvenient......for me :P\n\nI enjoy this game so much that I did a search to see what other games the company had made, and was really sad to see that they went bust shortly after this game was released. This game seems to have flown 'under the radar' which is ashame since it should have kept the company in business. I'm surprised KoA is not better known than it is. I bought KoA and all the dlcs when it was on sale here at steam, but it's definitely worth it's full asking price.\n","May 1, 2014","true","197.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/logicalsparrow/recommended/102500/","logicalsparrow","Logical Sparrow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/logicalsparrow/","135 products in account","Overall, the game is pretty good. The main problem is that it's too easy.\n\nWith Lorestones and unlockable Destinies, there are no shortages of permanent bonuses. If by the end of the game you have fewer than 30 bonus mods not related to your equipment, you must be doing a speed run.\n\nEach area apparently has a level range, and the levels of enemies get locked to your level within that range the first time you visit the area. There are no areas where the minimum level is 40+, meaning after you get to a certain point, leveling further becomes impossible. Luckily, 40 is more than enough to become totally invincible, especially with the Dead Kel DLC.\n\nWith some clever blacksmithing, you can end up one-shotting many foes, and bosses will take no more than 4 hits.\n\nAlso, the map you have is magic. For most quests, they ask you to go somewhere and find something or kill something, and the map knows exactly where it is, even if you haven't been there before. The Lost Treasure Of Meropis is a quest to find a bunch of relics sunken in various bodies of water. Surprise, surprise, it's not a "lost" treasure for long because your map knows exactly where all the relics are. This happens in 95% of quests. NPC's will be totally amazed that you found the lost journal of a long-dead scholar or the bandit-in-hiding.\n\nThis aside, The world is pretty large and decently well-rounded. Some of the quests are pretty interesting on their own, but most will seem silly. With a little work, your character will soon be the undefeated champion gladiator, the archsage of the largest group of mages, the king of a bunch of immortals, etc. Sadly, no NPC will know you are more than one of these at a time.\n\nThe fighting system is pretty good overall but again very biased in your favor. With the exception of certain bosses, no regular enemy has more than 2 or 3 attacks, many of which are staggered so you have time to react. The variety of enemies is lacking considering the size of the world so you can quickly learn how to deal with them all and then demolish everything standing in your way.\n\nThe storyline is alright once you properly understand how literal the characters are when they talk about fate. The Fae are pretty much stuck in an eternal loop of rebirth and redoing the same thing as last time, and knowing that they are doing it. The other races have fate issues too and your character seems to be the only exception. All things stem from this.\n\nFrom what I've seen of Skyrim, this game seems very similar to it, except this version seems to be more rushed in it's development and a little buggy.","March 1, 2014","true","118.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Dont compare it to Skyrim or similar games and you'll be pleased...that is if you like fast paced and intense combat, deep storyline, alchemy, crafting, and great voice acting/diversion.\n\nHas a nice spread of all the RPG elements so your not doing too much of any one thing.  Reckoning is simplified in ways that makes it easy to play without getting bogged down by realistic elements such as arrow counts (which I actually like...as in Skyrim), but is very well suited for this type of game.  It was designed for simplicity and even though its open world still feels linear, but again..keeps a smooth flow and makes it easy to play without having to over think or worry about getting lost (for example).\n\nAll the other reviews are true!...they did wonders for the inventory organization.  SO NICE!   Very nice story and voice acting...but does tend (for me) to feel like just one task after another, but THATS the game and means MORE XP!\n\nIm not one for flashy combat like in Final Fantasy series, but Reckoning has a fast paced combat tied with awesome cinematics that will surely keep your blood flowing.  Breaking down the 3 core rpg classes into warrior, rogue, and mage...you are able to focus on one or multiclass into any combination...and you get bonuses based on your choosing which can change as you do.  The addition to a 'power up' state called 'reckoning' is awesome.  Once you build this charge you truly do feel like a bada$$ and enemies beware!

The graphics were clean and nice but nothing spectacular, the progressing moves are visually impressive and fun, and the quests are plentiful; but there are a few things that I found disappointing that others may like to know before buying.\n\n1) Repetative - Like most RPGs, the repetitive nature is unavoidable, but in the case of Reckoning it was exhausting.  Every quest was the same (Kill/harvest __# of enemies/objects, find and rescue this person) so much so that I found myself avoiding side quests about 40 hours into the game.\n\n2) Scaled leveling - while some enjoy this, I like to feel a bit of power as I progress through a game.  The fact that boggarts (low level creatures which are succeptible to fire) took increasing amounts of swings/spells to kill was annoying, and while easy, fights seemed to drag on for insane amounts of time.\n\n3) Immersion - I'm a big morrowind fan, and I tend to like RPGs that are as immersive as that game was to me in 2003.  That being said I still like to hold each game in it's own light but found myself wanting more immersion with Reckoning.  Part of this I feel is due to the boundaries imposed by the designers...most games that lack a jump button or prohibit movement outside of predetermined area tend to feel less inviting for some reason - even if that inviting feeling leads to my death by gravity.\n\n4) Quest Tracking - You are only able to track 1 quest at a time. This forced fast a lot of fast travel for me because the next quest was across the huge map.  I hate to reference WoW, but their quest tracker is heavily missed in a world this large.  The problem with fast travel for me is that I stop paying attention to the surroundings and start feeling like I'm doing a chore.  This may just be a personal thing but I feel it's worth mentioning.\n\n5) Customization - The options menu is disparaging.  You can't upgrade graphics options, you can't remap some movements (going in and out of quest, inventory, map menus) required hitting "esc" key), the game is stuck in its out of the box condition.\n\n6) Story - combined with the quest issue, this kind of ties in with immersion, and made the story feel forced and generally bland.  There were a few moments where I was intruiged but for the most part it was lackluster.\n\n\nI would liken this game to Fable in its mechanics and feel, though Fable (the original) was designed and paced much better.  The game is enjoyable and fun, simply not astounding.  If there were a star rating on Steam, I would rate it 3/5, and it wouldn't surprise me if a 3.5/5 rating was the norm","March 10, 2014","true","100.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But there are major differences between Kingdoms and Skyrim most noteably, Kingdoms doesn't freeze, get lost, or crash like Skyrim does, especially the xbox version. HOWEVER this game was made for Windows 7, and the company didn't survive, which stinks btw... so there are crashes on Windows 10. Every time I tried to play this game on W10 it did crash after about 15 minutes of play, and others have said the same...so if you don't run Windows 7...you may want to pass on this one, even though it is a really great game.\n\nKingdoms is really well written, engaging, and fun to explore. The map is huge, AND most importantly, its easy to follow. There are a lot of cool features like  dispel chests which are challenging to unlock but hold a lot of valuable stuff in them. Although learning to open them can be a real pain in the fanny because if you fail, you suffer health loss, but they will still be unlocked. There are chests to find, tons of them...and lore stones that when you find and activate them, they reveal narration of the backstory. There is a lot going for this game, it's visually beautiful, reminiscent of Fable, but also holds its own original story and style, and great music, and so is the voice acting. The combat is fun with lots of weapons, spells, etc, to aid you. But the best feature of this game is the combat because it doesn't require the player to be at a high level before they get powerful weapons and spells. You get that pretty darn early so that is a plus in my book. There are 3 game difficulty levels, and several races to choose and build your character from male and female. Human and other.\nI have logged about 90 hours on this game  (mostly offline not recorded by Steam)... and I still haven't finished everything. There are a ton of side quests but not necessary for leveling up , but can be over-whelming if you start too many at once, which is very easy to do. Basically it is open-world, however the story is linear. The character design and environments were created by Todd McFarlane (creator of Spawn) so ...you know it's great.\nThis really is an overlooked game...but it plays very well, and you should check it out IF you run Windows 7.","January 30, 2014","true","82.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"

A strong world of warcraft feel to the graphics allows for a smooth gameplay on a poor spec machine.\nOn the world of warcraft note, I would like to add that the entire game feels like it was based off it. The graphocs, quests, locations and characters are all very similar to wow. That aside, there is a lot of orginality in the game, with decent voice acting, the combat system and the smithing concept.\n\n\nMy ratings for the game:\nAudio: 9/10 - Ambient soundtrack was done well, allowing for smooth transitions between combat and adventuring. The voice acting was done really well. No faults in my opinion, didn't get 10/10 because I wouldn't purchase the soundtrack just to listen to it.\n\nVisual: 9/10 - As mentioned above, the visuals are smooth and familiar.\n\nGameplay and Content: 10/10 - There is enough in game that I feel that I definately got my money's worth. I was lucky enough to catch KoA and all of it's DLC during a sale at a bargain price.\n\nReplayability: 6/10 - The different classes within the game allow for a HUGE amount of replayability. If you want to mix stealth and magic, there are classes and bonuses to suit. If you want to mix all three aspects, there are classes and bonuses for that too. If you want to focus purely on one aspect, then obviously, there are classes and bonuses for them too. The only problem is, even though I had a great time playing through once, I get bored with it quite quickly when I go to start the game again.\n\n\nAll in all, I would definately suggest the game to other people, and have done. I would really like to see 2 player co-op brought into the game, if I'd seen that come through, I don't think I would have to buy another game on steam ever again!","February 2, 2014","true","24.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

One of those claims is the development agenda and post-production of this game, a very interesting story in itself, but that has little bearing on the game as is, which offers some good Fantasy fun.\n\nIt helps to understand KoA:R in the context of Big Huge Games, 38 Studios, Project Copernicus and the game owners bankruptcy and default on a $75 million loan from the state of Rhode Island.  If the experience feels like an mmorpg in single player mode, that's because the game was more or less a template for the planned but never completed Copernicus.  Despite having strong opinions about this whole business, I won't say more since it's been covered well in the news, and at this point it's old news.\n\nThe story was crafted in large part by one of my favorite Fantasy novelists, R.A. Salvatore, and the quality shows.  Plentiful lore and background is there to find if you bother listening to dialogue, reading books and paying attention to quests.  In particular I enjoyed the Fae (Elves) Houses.  Their social traditions, internal politics and perceptions of the mortal races reflect the Fae's immortality/reincarnation in interesting ways.\n\nGameplay is rock solid.  It is slightly reminiscent of Fable.  Options for stealth, hack n'slash, melee, ranged, martial or magic devastation all stem from a clever class/skill mechanic seated in the game's lore about fate.  Essentially there are three archetypes: Warrior, Rogue, Mage - and three types that are hybrids of those.  The combat is engaging however you choose, with various combos and skills to mix it up.  The monsters are diverse and will keep you on your toes, although it is possible to skill and gear up to a point where the player is virtually unkillable, rendering tactics irrelevant and thus diminishing the satisfaction of well executed fights.  That only happens in late game though; plus, you can always increase the difficulty!  I played the entire game on the standard difficulty setting.\n\nDesign overall isn't all that innovative save for a few aspects.  It feels a little bit generic and safe as fantasy RPG's go.  One issue I had was that pacing seemed a little off.  I explored side areas and finished every faction questline in addition to many side quests, but still wasn't quite able to unlock the highest tier of the Fate system (classes) until the very end of the campaign.  Also, towards the halfway point and onwards, some side quests felt like derivative, cliche filler content for the level grind.  It felt like an mmo.  This wasn't a huge problem, just an annoyance.  Backpack expansions should be slightly more frequent and the inventory should have more categories for crafting materials in the trade interface.\n\nThe technical issues are few.  One rare but recurring problem is that the camera - during and immediately following combat - likes to get fancy and zoom out or chase the player at certain distances.  The camera gets stuck sometimes, or shows a bad angle that hinders combat.  Quest and lore items shouldn't count towards the inventory item limit.  For some odd reason, you can't switch from the journal to the map without first closing the journal.  Like so many RPG's, this one has recycled voice actors even for primary characters.  While the world is huge and varied, certain areas feel strangely boxed in when they shouldn't.\n\nThe music and the voice acting are brilliant here.  I was especially pleased with how high quality and well fleshed out the dialogue was.  The visuals are beautifully realized and have some fun fantasy art concepts behind them.  On the other hand, given the budget of this game it doesn't reflect the money spent in my opinion.\n\nI did not play the two content DLC's, Legend of Dead Kel and Teeth of Naros.  I recommend Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning to any fantasy aficionado.  If you check this out, you'll probably be glad you did.  I cannot necessarily recommend it to players with no patience or time for branching out from the main quest to see side content, or for players who are utterly uninterested in seeing more of the same from the fantasy genre.\n\nTIP: Use Reckoning as often as your fate bar fills up, since it rewards bonus experience for kills.\nTIP: The gear obtained via crafting (Blacksmithing plus Sagecrafting) tends to be the most powerful.  Crafting is greatly facilitated by diligent gathering of materials in the world and the salvaging of looted armor & weapons.\nTIP: Finish all of the faction quest lines at least, since those are among the more interesting content.","July 26, 2014","true","41.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The world building is generally interesting (and in parts very good), the dialogue pretty solid (and sometimes very good), the main plot line and dlcs are engaging. If you enjoy supplying an internal monologue about your character's motivations and history (e.g. playing the dlc after completing the main quest) this game allows you the space to do that. It's also pleasant to look at, though its paper doll options could be better.\n\nDownsides (especially for those interested in story-heavy rpgs): overall, the game has weak ties to other characters. There are no romances or friendships that you can build up outside of quest lines – mostly this left me feeling less-than-fulfilled from a story telling point of view, occasionally left me feeling eye-rollingly awash in cynicism, and sometimes surprised me by how much I came to care for an NPC nonetheless.\n\nThe voice acting is very much a mixed bag, as are the lorestones (in game archeological audio books). Sometimes they're interesting, rarely affecting, and occasionally, I regretted touching them, because I felt bad for the people involved. The pronunciation in the game is often downright terrible. With the names, I could almost convince myself that the pronunciation changes were deliberate – e.g. the name “Ciara” pronounced as see-ah-ra rather than key-ra, but then, at other points it was just ordinary words that got mangled. Not a big deal for a lot of players of course – but for me, it was more than enough to throw me out of the story and the story was what I came for.\n\nAnother issue – much of the game is heavily derivative. This is not something I have a big problem with generally, but it's worth mentioning here because of two things: one – it *felt* derivative; it wasn't something I noticed later, but rather as I was playing it, it felt like a retread of other games; two – I found myself thinking in places, “wow that's really interesting, I've never seen that before” and then immediately wondering if it's just because I'd missed the game where someone else had done it first. Again, not an issue for everybody.\n\nSomeone else can probably talk about visual issues/bugs better than I can, but I would mention two things: post-processing didn't work for me (and if I hadn't worked out the problem in the demo version I probably would not have played the game at all), and some weird design decision during a major main-plot boss fight required me to look up a walkthrough because although I wasn't losing, I couldn't win. My victory was pointless and tedious and in the end I was just glad to get it over with. If I hadn't had dlc left to play, it might well have soured the memory of the game for me.\n\nBUT: overall, yes, I would recommend, and I would recommend going in with your eyes open so that you can enjoy all the things the game does well while accepting that parts of it are not fulfilling and some of it is actively frustrating.\n\nOne final note: it has low to non-existent replay value for me (and I'm generally all about the replays), but I did get about 100 hours out of it between the main quest, faction quests and dlcs.","February 28, 2014","true","99.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

After about 40 hours of questing I got tired of doing practically the same quests over and over again. I even skipped through the conversations, and I normally read/listen all dialogues, mind you.\n\nKoA is basically a ♥♥♥♥♥♥me in single-player form. Is it a bad game ? Not by any means. It's just that it loses focus about halfway through, giving you too many quests to deal with. This game can easily take 100+ hours to complete.\n\nThe active combat system works great; you're not just pushing buttons and waiting for your character to finish off an enemy. YOU do the actual combat. It's fresh until you have unlocked most of your skills though, then it can grow a bit stale.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game was the inventory system, which was awkward to use. Having to pause, select a category and (un)equip items that way is cumbersome and frustrating. It's an area that could definitely use some work.\n\nFor an action RPG it's pretty cool, but don't expect another Skyrim.\n\n[Rating: 84/100]","March 22, 2012","true","41.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I'm not an MMO player, but I do enjoy this game.\n\nIt is like an MMO in some respects, but it lacks the things that make MMOs not fun. For one thing, it isn't grindy. You don't have to invest many hours to get into this game. There are a lot of side quests, but they don't feel as trivial as the ones you might encounter in MMOs. The battle system feels very fluid and polished and you don't have to spam your number keys to get attacks off.\nAs far as what I kind of don't like about this game there is a rather large land to explore, but it consists of a lot of trails and forks in those trails. There are some open areas, but you will mostly find yourself on trails. It isn't a real big negative though because you don't feel like the game is a linear excursion.\n\nAll in all, this game is worth a look, but especially so if you can get it on a sale.","February 4, 2014","true","16.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soulsmith/recommended/102500/","soulsmith","Tomahawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soulsmith/","49 products in account","Fair warning: tall wall of text below.\n\nI think if KoA was released an year before it's actual appearance, this game would become way more popular. It was flattened by stronger contenders, such as Skyrim, and didn't get enough recognition. Which, in my opinion, is unfair. This game deserves some love, because it is really well made.\n\nThe world is open and very large. It has many secrets to share. It's easy to get lost. But you don't get that "Bring me back" feeling, it is an experience - to explore new lands and watch out for new enemies and loot. NPCs are ranging from standart "good guys" and confusing, but adorable, midgets to psychos and evil mages with robes and whatever goes with typical villain appearance. Unfortunately, almost none of the are remarkable. You will often hear voice of the same person when speaking to NPCs in literally same exact location. Base models are quite often reused too. Slightly damages overall atmosphere of "everything new and unusual".\n\nQuests are fun. Sometimes. Boring "go-there-and-speak-to-this-person-then-speak-to-other-person" quests are rare, but you will eventually stumble upon those. But even they always come with a twist. Speak to these four persons and find out how to place them in a column, so they won't kill each other, please. Quests are more like little adventrues, that will take you to the unexplored dungeons and cryptic castles (most of which would look exactly the same for you, but don't bother). All of them have stories behind them, but they seem rather... irrelevant. You don't feel the impact of your actions. You just helped that man, who claims to be the wolf, turned into humanoid by evil fairies. Now he thanks you and bids farewell. You will never see him again. And soon enough you will forget about him. Really rarely you get to see what have you done to others. Game simply erases it form the memory. The only reminder of that will calmly sit in your quest book. Strikethrough.\n\nThe combat on the other hand is developed amazingly. Strikes chain into beautiful combos, combos then develop into cascades of hits and then finishing blow. Rinse, repeat. Never mind that your character will do the same moves over and over. You will never get tired of them. There are tons of weapon types and all of them have their unique move sets. Not all of them will be unlocked at the beginning; it will take few levels and some skill points investments to unlock new attacks. Mixing them with generic weapon attacks will result in gorgeous sights and dead enemies. Charge the key and then... maelstrom of blades or magic envelops you. Truly amusing.\n\nYou also can kill any NPC that you don't like, ransack a wardrobe only to find peasant's tunic in here, pickpocket someone for sweet cash. Of course it comes with punishment. Of course local guards will try to stop you. And then you have a choice to bribe them, run away or go to prison like a good person (and then escape one moment later, brutally murdering everyone who stands on your way). Game doesn't stop you from being bad guy. You have your own path to follow, there is no set road. And I like it. And some quests actually reward that. So prepare your quick fingers, as a lot of stuff will stick to them quite soon.\n\nGraphics are what you expect from 2011 game. Yes. they are not great, yes, they are cartoonish. But then you see a landscape and you finger automatically reaches the F12 button. Not always you will get breathtaking views, but when you do, you will be pleased. Architecture also deserves special mention. Sometimes reminds me of Warcraft, sometimes of Oblivion, other times feels like you were thrown into Witcher. There are many wonderful places, some of them will make you spend time simply staring on puzzling ornament on a wall, while you're being pursued by swarm of spiders. When it comes to NPCs. Most of them are bricky and not looking like someone who can breathe. But on the other hand, when you get used to it, you will skip this part and go straight sor details. And some persons you'll meet look really great. Maybe it's haircut, tattoos or eyes, or even mix of three at the same time, they catch your attention with their features.\n\nI enjoyed this game. My only real complaint is that inventory is so small. Picking up everything and the selling it to vendor anyway is, like, my favourite way to play RPG. But seriously, if you want to create your own character and be unbound, be yourself basically; you are not becoming sick after seeing "video-game graphics" and you are not playing any other RPG for some reason - you will enjoy it. The price is relatively low as well, on a sale it becomes nearly free.\n\nAnd good luck, Child of Dust.","April 18, 2015","true","45.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","2"

It does almost everything to its genre correcty; environments are gorgeous, there is an absolute ton of dialogue and the world building is fantastic. The towns and locations you visit are decently varied, the leveling and crafting systems are very nicely done, and there are enough quests to get completely sidetracked for several hours. Which I did.\n\nIn fact, I got sidetracked on the DLC main quests without even realizing I had completely dodged the main quest, and only started it after finishing the Teeth DLC and exploring to the largest city on the first half of the map, finishing at level 16 with near-endgame gear. For me, this was fine; the world is interesting enough and I love the concept for the main plot. Unfortunately, when you look away from that main plot is when the game starts to unravel a bit. Let's start with combat.\n\nCombat plays from one of three main playstyles: a rogue with daggers and a bow, mighty warrior with heavy weapons, and mage with spells. That's fine and all three seem well done, and I ultimately went with a dagger/bow build by the time I'd set off on the main quest. The issue I have with the combat comes from the difficulty curve. It seems like the game uses a scaling system for difficulty, and if it doesn't, has much larger problems. Some enemies clearly did not scale, and appropriately went down immediately. Others did scale, and were appropriately challenging, serving as interesting little minibosses to put a little life into exploration. There were also awkward half-breeds between the two, which would deal very little damage, but still have the health pool of a fully scaled enemy, which made traveling around a tedious run of "is this even worth fighting" as I sprinted across the plains and ultimately found myself at a door that wouldn't open until I sat down and killed off all twenty enemies that had followed me in. This amounted to me standing there mashing the attack and bow buttons until, several minutes later, their massive health bars finally caved to attrition and let me proceed.\n\nThis wouldn't be as much of a problem if their damage, or at least some other part of them than their health, has also come to join the party. And this problem doesn't just apply to regular enemies; bosses also have a unique form of this problem. Bosses seem to do appropriate amounts of damage, making it seem like I'm in for an interesting battle of dodging fireballs, rolling behind axe swings, and stabbing these major foes down. The way it would usually play out is they hit me twice, dealing half my health, then die instantly to a single combo.\n\nThis problem didn't just apply to bosses after overleveling either, even the bosses I was underleveled for in the Teeth DLC dropped at the exact same rate, right up to its final big bad, which was broken up into four distinct phases of "deal 25%, dodge for 30 seconds, hit him again." This made going into any fight feel like slogging through mud, as either I'd fight ten regular enemies with far too much health or a single boss that goes down before I feel remotely engaged in the battle. And if I'm wrong and enemies don't scale, the difficulty curve of the game is absolutely all over the place for no reason, as early quests have you running to all ends of the map at what would be a much lower level than I was.\n\nIt also suffers from the NPC assist problem: enemies (occasionally) seem to scale scale. Your allies, for any occasion you have them, do not. On a large battlefield where you're supposed to be collectively driving the enemy back, your allies seem to just be there as set pieces. I'm well aware that this is a genre-wide problem. Almost every game of this nature (open-world exploration based RPG) suffers from this in some form; your NPC allies just aren't useful, and it really subtracts from the experience when you're supposed to be fighitng alongside all of these soldiers and three of them take four minutes to kill a single rat.\n\nDue to these problems, combat just stops being interesting once the first impression wears off. As soon as the honeymoon is over, the magic is completely gone. By no means is the combat bad, and I may have fallen into a niche where the build I had just wasn't expected by the game, but it made things far less enjoyable to me.\n\nBeyond that, there are only a few minor complaints. Dialogue is a bit long-winded at times. While the world building gets a free pass at this (written by R. A. Salvatore, who did a fantastic job designing the backstory and cities), the script was done by the actual studio, and they apparently didn't quite get the memo of "tell more, say less." This is fine early on. You want to know as much as possible about what you're getting into, of course, and it's very enjoyable there. Later in the game, dialogue feels like it doesn't need to carry on as long, such as when I stopped in the middle of a battlefield to sit through ten minutes of dialogue as someone relayed tons of details that could have been summed up with "That monster needs to die."\n\nIf you're a fan of long, expository dialogue, that's all well and good. It stalled the action for me in what was meant to be a major turning point of combat in the game, and I wasn't a fan of that.\n\nSo the good things? World building, fantastic. Character creation/leveling, all great. Crafting? Tons of it. Exploration-based gameplay that is appropriately rewarded? Solid, there are countless chests hidden in niches and secret treasure hoards around the map. Large enough map to spend hours wandering and questing? Absolutely, the damn thing's gigantic.\n\nThe game suffers from the same exact things that plague other titles in the genre, such as Dragon Age or Fable, but also takes the best aspects of those games and combines them into the setting and character design. If that's a train you're willing to ride, climb aboard.","December 27, 2015","true","13.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's like god of war mixed with a really fun RPG that allows you to pick your upgrades from 3 trees (Stealth, Fighter, Mage) and allows you to mix the trees up, the only limit is the number of points you have to spend and the level requirement for that tier, as well as the occassional pre-requisite to have an upgrade from an earlier tier to be in your repitoire before you can unlock a later tier upgrade in that tree. There is a main storyline, but the side quests are a blast and are littered throughout each map. You'll want to hit up the DLC content around level 9 or 10 due to the gear that drops being for level 1 through 18. The enemies are gorgeous to look at while you come up with awesome new combos or ways to kill them, and the view of your surroundings is beautiful in most levels. One of the most beautiful places to visit are the caverns with the all the glowing effects and magical sprites floating about, really nice to look at.  Don't forget to check out the arena in the desert and battle your way to new gear and other rewards. So many things to do and see in this game, it will keep you enthralled for a good 50 hours at least. Add in a couple of playthroughs to explore each area fully and see the different reactions to another race choice and you have well over 100 hours of hard core RPG/action to fall in love with. Each enemy is crafted with such tiny details, my favorite is the one with the wood mask facade for a face that opens up to reveal some really sharp and evil looking teeth and glowing eyes atop a gaping mouth. So many details in the architecture make each area you visit a wonder to behold as you walk around just soaking in the view that the extremely talented artists rendered. I really wish there were more games like this. Just like with the Elder Scrolls and Fallout worlds, i could spend months in here and never feel bored.","February 3, 2014","true","47.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I would have payed full price for it. Ended up getting it during the 2014 winter sale.\n\nThe visual style and combat is nothing like skyrim. In my opinion, the combat in skyrim is more fun only because you can make it as challenging as you want. People say this game is easy, and they're not lying. If you're looking for a harder experience start out pure mage. If the combat was harder, it would far surpass skyrims system. The flow of it is very fun and worth it even despite it's easiness, which should say alot about it.\n\nThe quests are fun and rewarding, and the loot/equipment system is more akin to Diablo than Elder Scrolls. Some people will like that, and some people won't. I love it. The alchemy and blacksmithing system is awesome, and it gives you a reason to go around collecting raegents and tools.

The graphics have that sort of fantasy vibe to it, although it's not really at a good resolution. I'm not sure how you change the resolution either. There doesn't seem to be any graphics options that let you change it. That's very bad. Very very bad. My monitor is a 1680x1050 and it looks a bit washed out with this resolution. I can still play it, but I just wish I could change some of the graphics options.\n\nEdit: Upon further inspection, the only time you can change the graphics options are in the main menu.\n\nThe gameplay is pure hack-and-slash fun. Think of games like Darksiders. That is kind of this game (minus the epic areial combos). This game is also a loot-fest. You get new equipment very frequently (if you take the time to explore). All the weapons are really fun to use and have different strengths and weaknesses to them, like the daggers being the fast and low-damage type, hammers which are the slow but hard-hitting type, typical etc. etc.. You also can do numerous special moves that you unlock with each weapon type. You also have this fate weaving ability (forgot what it was called) where you press and hold the triggers (or the keyboard equivalent) to slow down time and kill your enemies faster and impale them to death with large energy spears...Hmm. Yes. Overall, very fun and engaging combat.\n\nThe story is alright, it's not cliche, but it's nothing to write home about. You are basically the vitcim of a war, and you have died. Yes, you heard me right. You died. But don't fret, something called the well of life resurrected you. I don't really know anything else because I most likely have forgotten. The voice acting is also quite good. Not Skyrim levels, but still it's not gut wrenchingly bad.\n\nThe only thing that I would have had improved is the user interface. The inventory system feels very cluttered and since your items are featured on one page in a sort of list structure, albiet seperated in categories, it's hard to navigate. I wish they would've shown all of your items on the single screen instead of having to scroll down to see which new items you have acquired, or want to equip, etc. Also the camera kind of sucks, it's very close sometimes, and then sometimes it's further away.\n\nOverall, I like this game and would reccommend anyone who likes games like Skyrim or Darksiders to pick this up.

First off, I have to point out that this game is heavly focused on combat and less so on story and epic adventures which is why I was surprised as I tend to lead more towards those games.\n\nThe combat in this game is very good in fact, its among the best I've come across in an action RPG. This games biggest pro's are the entertaining combat sequences, the rather large selection of spells and abilities and the selection of weapons / armour.\n\nWhen in comes to the charcters and story, this game is somewhat average, but fortunately the fun you get from the gameplay makes up for this and you tend to forget about the wooden characters and the mediocre main quest. I won't go into to much detail but the game is worth playing if the story is not everything to you.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game to any action RPG fan and if your interest leans more toward gameplay and combat than the main storyline then you won't be dissapointed.\n\nI give this game a 7.5 / 10 - Good.","May 16, 2014","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can "multiclass" between Tough Smashy Style, Sneaky Stabby Style, and Explody Magic Style.\n\nThe lore is more-or-less your standard fantasy novel business - there's good (not-)elves and bad (not-)elves and the bad (not-)elves are going HAM on your homeland.  Good thing you're a Chosen One and can stand up to those naughty naughty (not-)elves!  Did we mention that you have a Mysterious Past that you have to uncover?  Of course you do.\n\nIt's going to be tainted by comparison to Skyrim, as they're both Epic Fantasy Smashy Smash games.  Skyrim excels in having a truly open world (much of KOA is pretty much linear - the old invisible fence is full in effect here) and near-limitless modification capacity.  KOA excels at having a much more enjoyable combat system - lots of fancy combos and trick moves.  There's a "rage meter" mechanic that's kind of neat in a silly "Mortal Kombat" way - you charge up your murders and then you go into Super Murder Mode, where you get, of all things, a quicktime event where you have to mash buttons to Extra Super Duper Murder someone for bonus XP.\n\nIt's silly, even for Epic Fantasy Gaming, but it's probably worth snagging on sale.","March 18, 2015","true","16.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have to say, I rather enjoy it very much and I am kicking myself for not giving it a shot before.\n\nThe artstyle for this is what hit me first. It has such a bright and colorful atmosphere while still being able to be dark when it needs to be. I find myself looking around each and every new area I visit rather thuroughly and not being disappointed in the least. The designs of the characters, items and equipment are also very unique and the fact that Todd McFarlane had his hands in it really shows.\n\nIt has a story that really draws you in and it has such an ambiguous morality meter that you really feel your impacts on the world. the gameplay is just as fun and addictive as well adding a unique combo and weapon swap ability that just works and the magic use itself is spectacular. It is not without it's faults though as I found the quests themselves rather repetative. Other than that, it is definitely worth the full price that it is. :) 8.5/10","February 7, 2014","true","23.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Bought it on a whim and it was worth every dollar. Nothing revolutionary but I love how you can fine tune the combat to your style considering I love being a Jack-of-all-Trades player and often times a player is penalized for it.\n\nThe world is large enough that it was occasionally a bother to get from one place to another but for me it adds to the immersion, but not too large that you'll waste all your time wandering it or having to fast travel from one place to the other exclusively.\n\nThe writing, quests and options available to you are all well done with relatively few bugs. Only bug I found was a quest where you had to get an item from a character and rather than kill him I stole it, game didn't like that so I killed him, then it didn't count the item in my inventory but I couldn't grab something he didn't have at that point.

It's standard high fantasty, but it's not gritty or enthalling in a way like the Witcher or Dragon Age is.  The writing is a big part of those, this does feel more like FedEx quests.

I love games that likes to let you explore and this game captures that perfectly. I constantly find myself wandering through caves, forests, and cities. The only con I have with this game is the lack of difficulty. When you hit levle 25-30 every boss become really easy to kill. So by then you should just crank up your difficulty level and keep moving. Of course there are tiny little flaws, but I can't even remember them so they are nothing to worry about.

However, this makes it easier to find every quest and not to miss something important. There are tons of caves, cities, castles and forests  that are enjoyable to explore. Besides, you can fast-travel to any location you have visited so far, which is a great tool.\n\nThere are three skilltrees in which you can invest , you do not have to limit your points to one of them. You can mix them up in any way you want to. You will encounter several fateweavers in the game which can reset your skill points for a bit some money, depending on your level. The level cap in this game is 40.\n\nThe story itself is pretty cool and presented very well but gets a bit lengthy towards the end, yet the ending itself is spectacular again. There are several moments where you can influence certain outcomes with your decisions.\n\nThere is a extremely large number of available side-quests in this game,  I ended up having completed around 300 of them (with both DLC’s). Some of them go with the standard pattern like finding some reagents or killing some mobs while on the other hand there are some pretty big side-quests that bring a little story on their own which are very entertaining to follow.\n\nThe game has 3 difficulty-settings and I recommend you to play it on hard since it’s still pretty easy on medium as long as you’re not fighting large groups of enemies, especially towards the end when you got the best kinds of armor and weapons.\n\nThere is a variety of different enemies that behave different in battle which leads to entertaining fights. The Gameplay itself is pretty good in my eyes,  especially the combats are very dynamic.\n\nThe graphics are quite good for early 2012 and the world is designed with a love for detail. You’ll find many different environments that feel alive. The great music of this game strengthens the atmosphere even more.\n\nOn the downside, there are some bugs in this game which will never get fixed because the studio that produced this game went bankrupt. However, most of these bugs just make some quest items being stuck in your inventory after you completed the quest or other minor things that one can oversee.\n\nIn Amalur, you can acquire various houses in which you can store your items, you can even earn an own arena and a mining company which gain you money over time.\n\nThere are various weapon types with different advantages and downsides which brings some additional diversity.\n\nRegarding the DLC’s, I can greatly recommend you “The Legend of Dead Kel” and “Teeth of Naros”, which both have a great storyline and add another big map part to the already huge map each. However, the “Weapons & Armor Bundle” just adds a bit of loot that falls off quite quick and in my opinion is not worth the money.\n\nAll in All, I truly recommend giving Kingdoms of Amalur a try, for it a large and beautiful game with a wonderful atmosphere.\n\n\n\nP.S.: Sorry for my bad English, it’s not my native language.","April 17, 2014","true","164.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ddlagarry/recommended/102500/","ddlagarry","CinderellaMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ddlagarry/","724 products in account","KoA: TR is a classic action / RPG in the style of Dungeon Seige III.  As such, its appeal is mostly for fans of the console based RPG who enjoy the simplistic interface and sophisticated button mashing combat.  I come strictly from the PC world so I tend to prefer things like Skyrim, Baldur's Gate, and the like.  However this game managed to keep my attention because of its "charm" and great combat.\n\nI assume that you are familiar with the basics of an ARPG title, so I'll skip right to the pros:\n> The world is absolutely huge.  I have 40 hours logged so far and have completed about half the game in terms of exploring the map.\n> The number of quests and side quests is equally enormous.  Given this, the means for managing them all works quite well... any quest can be designated "primary" and tracked easily through the kingdom.  Secondary quests appear only on the detailed map which shows the immediate area.\n> The voice acting is excellent, and ALL NPC dialog is spoken.  I recognized one of the voice actors from Skyrim!  I wouldn't be surprised if there are others from the school of Bethesda.\n>  The combat, which is the meat and potatoes of the game really, is fantastic.  This is the primary reason to play this game.  The controls are easy to learn (I recommend an XBOX controller) and the unlocks as you progress are interesting and powerful.\n> Although there are basic classes (ranged/mage/tank) the level of customization available allows you to combine classes in interesting ways or focus on a specific branch within the class.\n> Crafting is available (create gems/blacksmithing/alchemy)... and exploring any one of those paths yeilds GREAT rewards mid-late game.\n> The pacing is excellent, and largely under your control.\n> AWESOME support for 3D Vision... you will want to patch the game using helixmods.  Google it.\n> Great weapon effects, such as flame, electricity, ice etc.\n> The story is interesting.\n> The camera is generally well managed by the game, particularly in combat.\n> It is possible to completely "respec" your character at any time!\n\nAnd the CONS:\n> Graphically the game reminds me of world of warcraft... rather cartoonish.  Not necessarily a deal killer but I prefer a more realistic look.\n> The character animations are limited, in particular when speaking dialog.  You will see the same animations repeated hundreds of times, to the point where you begin to notice them... a bit distracting.\n> Occasionally there are some wild camera glitches.\n> The difficulty can be uneven, especially early in the game.  You will be sailing along beating up baddies with abandon and then be unable to complete a boss fight without reducing the difficulty.  That seems to be less of a problem by mid-game if you have been managing your build well.\n> The loot drops are generally not that interesting... mostly junk, at least by mid-game... although by that time you have a specific build in mind and you are looking for specific loot.  I find that merchants are a better source of loot than drops.\n\nOverall I heartily recommend this game\n9/10 (if you have 3d Vision, 10/10)","November 20, 2014","true","98.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

There are several bugs in the game that there are no fixes for and which get you stuck, permanently.  So if you didn't make a separate save (not auto-save) then you basically have to start over.  The first time it happened I had a save from like 10 hours previous, very frustrating but I kept playing.  Then it happened again on another quest.  It just blows my mind that the developers don't even acknowledge it, let alone try to issue a patch for it.","September 13, 2014","false","86.6"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ioveracker/recommended/102500/","ioveracker","Isaac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ioveracker/","247 products in account","I'm hesitant to recommend this game because I didn't love it, but for some reason I kept playing it until the end.  I found myself speeding through some of the more boring bits of the game just to see the main storyline through to completion, but honestly, the main story leaves much to be desired.  The world is huge and feels very complete, but unfortunately much of this is lost if you--like me--can't quite cross the threshold into obsession with exploring the world.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly fun and varied for an action RPG, but the skill progression for the sorcery tree is VERY unbalanced.  You'll spend the first third of the game abusing the same couple of abilities over and over again, feeling somewhat underpowered and dependent on your physical weapon to fill in the damage gaps.  It starts to balance out a bit in the middle of the sorcery tree, but then the scales are tipped ridiculously upon reaching the highest tier.  The Meteor ability is capable of wiping out an entire group of enemies, and while it does have a long cooldown, it is always ready by the time you reach the next group and doesn't consume enough mana to slow you down.  Speaking of mana, itemization was a bit frustrating and seemed too random.  I finished the game with a staff bought from a vendor, but then again, I was just destroying armies of fools with giant meteors summoned from the depths of space, so who needs a nice staff?\n\nOne of the things that continued to irritate me in this game is the sound.  I'm not sure if they didn't have the budget for a good sound team or if they hired amateurs, but the sounds in this game feel completely wrong.  One example is the sound they used for a shattering clay jar.  It doesn't feel like part of the environment, but instead a flat sound file played slightly out of sync with the action.  There are many other examples of terrible sounds throughout the game.  The music was occasionally decent, but for the most part it was forgettable.\n\nThe graphics in this game were nice enough, and the art style felt consistent and well-done.  Framerate was never an issue on my aging machine--even with settings on max--so clearly the core tech team behind the engine knew what they were doing.\n\nAll of my complaints aside, I still found myself coming back to this game day after day to see what was around the next bend.  Upon completion, I almost felt as if I could do more exploring or wrap up some of those faction quests I left unfinished...but, I have better games to play.  If you like MMO-style gameplay and want to get lost in a big, lonely world for hours on end, give Kingdoms of Amalur a shot.  However, if you--like me--find yourself with less and less time to play games these days, you may not get as much out of this game as you put into it.","April 27, 2014","true","25.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drussard/recommended/102500/","drussard","Snackiecakes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drussard/","236 products in account","This game surprised me.  I read some reveiws that said it was surprisingly good but it still caught me off guard.  I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I am.  It's a pleasant feeling to be surprised these days by a game that seemed to be so resoundingly denounced on release.  I highly recommend playing it, even with all its' flaws, because it's fun and familiar.\n\nLet's get the bad out of the way:\n-The first 30 minutes.  It's awkward to control without tweaking because it was absolutely designed to be used with a controller.  If you have one, I recommend using it.  If not, tinker with sensitivity and hotkeys to make it more playable.  The defacto tutorial level is unimpressive, slightly confusing, and rather buggy.  It takes you through each class and weapon type but you don't have to commit just yet.  At this point it seems to be super linear, on rails type of game but push through to the first village and it opens up.\n-The camera.  It takes getting used to.  The third person perspective is unfortunate.  While I generally play in third person, not having the option to move the camera is frustrating at times.  This is one of the areas where it's design for consoles is very evident.\n-Vanilla.  This isn't really a negative or a positive.  It's what you expect from a game like this.  Some fetch quests, some kill quests, some steal quests, a few factions and schools to join, and the RPG trinity of classes.  Even with some multiclassing, it's still an expected experience class wise.\n\nThe Good:\n-Rich lore.  If you didn't know, it is written by RA Salvatore and it shows.  Some of the stories feel familiar if you are a fan of his books.  One of the first questlines, The House of Ballads, is very interesting and they continue in the vein throughout.\n-Tons of side quests.  You can get lost in sidequests for a few hours with each new area and those discovered in the wild.\n-Combat seems simple on the surface (and can remain so if you desire) but with multiclassing can become dynamic and engaging.\n-Crafting! I generally only craft because I have to but this system makes it easy.  It is not particularly deep or impressive in it's installation but it is perfect for players like me who don't generally dump a ton of time into it.  I like that you can craft usable items at any point no matter the skill level.  Strength of weapons or armor are based on components used and NOT player skill.  A small but important distiction.\n\nThis game is everything you expect from an open world RPG in the Elder Scrolls vein.  Why would that be a bad thing?  Just because it has been done before doesn't mean it can't be done again and done well.  Pick it up and have fun with it, I know I have.","April 3, 2014","true","61.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has the same open world feel as Skyrim, and allows you to fast travel to places you've been before. The looting system is much the same, only it allows for more.\n\nFor instance, you get the inventory is full instead of slowing down.\n\nFor another, within your inventory are bags. Each bag is for a crafting. Alchemy, sagecrafting (jewelcrafting), and blacksmithing. The components for all are placed within these bags, and not in your actual inventory. So you can stock up as much as you like on them all.\n\nYou're able to purchase a house, expand it, and have your own shared storage within it.\n\nThe scenery is gorgeous, the characters are pretty amusing, and while the character customization is sparse, you're allowed to be something other than friggin' human.\n\nThe plot has an absolutely fascinating premise, and how many games can you play that starts you off in a dumping ground for corpses?\n\nIt also touches a LOT on fae mythology. Brownies, trolls, sprites, etc. The elves are particularly badass in this game rather than being a bunch of pretentious snots or a downtrodden race.\n\nThe downside to this game is that there won't be any sequels coming to it due to the company going out of business.","March 16, 2014","true","124.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drussard/recommended/102500/","drussard","Snackiecakes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drussard/","236 products in account","This game surprised me.  I read some reveiws that said it was surprisingly good but it still caught me off guard.  I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I am.  It's a pleasant feeling to be surprised these days by a game that seemed to be so resoundingly denounced on release.  I highly recommend playing it, even with all its' flaws, because it's fun and familiar.\n\nLet's get the bad out of the way:\n-The first 30 minutes.  It's awkward to control without tweaking because it was absolutely designed to be used with a controller.  If you have one, I recommend using it.  If not, tinker with sensitivity and hotkeys to make it more playable.  The defacto tutorial level is unimpressive, slightly confusing, and rather buggy.  It takes you through each class and weapon type but you don't have to commit just yet.  At this point it seems to be super linear, on rails type of game but push through to the first village and it opens up.\n-The camera.  It takes getting used to.  The third person perspective is unfortunate.  While I generally play in third person, not having the option to move the camera is frustrating at times.  This is one of the areas where it's design for consoles is very evident.\n-Vanilla.  This isn't really a negative or a positive.  It's what you expect from a game like this.  Some fetch quests, some kill quests, some steal quests, a few factions and schools to join, and the RPG trinity of classes.  Even with some multiclassing, it's still an expected experience class wise.\n\nThe Good:\n-Rich lore.  If you didn't know, it is written by RA Salvatore and it shows.  Some of the stories feel familiar if you are a fan of his books.  One of the first questlines, The House of Ballads, is very interesting and they continue in the vein throughout.\n-Tons of side quests.  You can get lost in sidequests for a few hours with each new area and those discovered in the wild.\n-Combat seems simple on the surface (and can remain so if you desire) but with multiclassing can become dynamic and engaging.\n-Crafting! I generally only craft because I have to but this system makes it easy.  It is not particularly deep or impressive in it's installation but it is perfect for players like me who don't generally dump a ton of time into it.  I like that you can craft usable items at any point no matter the skill level.  Strength of weapons or armor are based on components used and NOT player skill.  A small but important distiction.\n\nThis game is everything you expect from an open world RPG in the Elder Scrolls vein.  Why would that be a bad thing?  Just because it has been done before doesn't mean it can't be done again and done well.  Pick it up and have fun with it, I know I have.","April 3, 2014","true","61.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They require time, dedication, and skill. But in return, they give you one of the greatest possible benifits- no, not a drip for your sensory systems or endorphins, but an endless creativity and a bueatiful world. That being said, creating a game is different from creating a painting. It can't just look good, it must be fun to play, fun to interact with, fun to experience. And while when many think of RPG, TES comes to mind, I think Amalur: Reckoning is one of those games that is sorely missed. It carries you into a colerfull, viberant, world, ripe with imagination and ready for the taking. It gives you what is, in my opinion, a better system than any other game- it allows you to have the freedom of skyrim, but also the classical class system and skill trees. The gameplay is fun, the world is simply gourgeous, and the lore is plentiful. This is one hell of a game you would not want to miss.\n\n(NOTE: I am a PC gamer, however, I find this game is much more enjoyable with Xbox 360 controller.

There is fast travel to to discovered locations, which helps.\n\nThe DLCs were enjoyable and worth the extra money.  You can also continue to explore after you go through the main quest line to mop up anything you missed.  7.5/10.","June 22, 2014","true","81.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is a massive amount of content in the game, so it is a definitive timesink, which is great for open worlds at the scale of this one. But, I found the lore difficult to understand, story old, tried and true. I can't get into it as much as I would like, and much like Skyrim, after a while, it just becomes Dungeon/Cave Simulator. Go in hole, kill that, come back. At least there's fast travel.\n\nIt's better suited to be played with a controller, but my biggest gripe is the FOV: holy jesus it's practically stuck to the back of the character's head. If you do pick up the game, either expect motion sickness, or install an FOV fix, such as Widescreen Fixer.\n\nIt's worth picking up and playing, you might enjoy it more than I did, but it's no masterpiece.","June 22, 2014","true","25.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's got more of a fantasy look than anything and they certainly did a good job on that. While in combat everything looks really smooth and it's fun to look at... especially those finishers, oh man. Sometimes the combat is a little clunky though, mostly regarding the camera. It doesn't have a lock on feature so sometimes it's a little frustrating when you're trying to lock target onto someone else. With that aside, the combat is still great.\n\nUsually with an RPG, you'll have to go down a specific specialization to be powerful. That mostly holds true in this game, though you can still spread your talents more thin and still not do underwhelming damage.\n\nThere's lots and lots and lots of quests. You might not even find all of them which makes this game great. Though it's no Elder Scrolls size, it's still a large game. Because you can make so many different characters and take different quest paths, it's definitely got great replay value. I'd certainly reccomend this game.\n\n9/10","November 28, 2014","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Eu fui assim em relação a ele, até joga-lo.\n\nE mudei totalmente meu ver, é um daqueles jogos que são pouco divulgados, mas merecem o reconhecimento.\n\nO jogo se passa no Reino de Amalur, onde você é um escolhido do '' Destino '', algo que torna as coisas ao redor mudarem, e você é o principal protagonista de um certo experimento ter dado certo e escolhido para impedir o mal ( Clichê que nunca acaba. )\n\nMas, vendo ao mundo vasto que Amalur mostra, sidequests são quase infinitas, dungeons são várias e os cenários,  super bem feitos e diferenciados.\n\nEu já vi isso em vários outros jogos, mas de qualquer forma vale ressaltar o elemento mais ♥♥♥♥ que KoA abrange:  o Combate Hack N' Slash.\nNão é como em RPGs clássicos que você '' de repente '' encontra um inimigo, ou em uma batalha em turnos, é tudo naquele momento, você viu o inimigo e ja começa a pancadaria, independente do ambiente que for, todos os movimentos acontecem e fluem extremamente bem, sem um único erro ou bug. E até com 4 inimigos a sua frente, é possível enfrentá-los todos ao mesmo tempo, focando todos ao modo que você quiser, através de ataques corpo-a-corpo, longo alcance e magia.\n\nIsso já determina as 3 classes, que, apesar de serem poucas, possuem habilidades significativas para cada uma das classes.\nExemplo: Não é possível ser Mago do Fogo ou do Gelo, Mago é Mago, você usa\ntanto fogo, como gelo, eletricidade, e até sumona um esqueleto para lhe ajudar.\nUm fator legal das classes é você poder misturar uma com a outra, podendo fazer um guerreiro + mago, ou assassino + guerreiro, e por ai vai.\nMas claro, é possível seguir uma skill tree só, mas eu acho meio chato sinceramente, já que o jogo oferece você poder misturar os combos de cada classe para acabar com os inimigos.\nO level máximo do jogo é 40, achei baixo, mas é o suficiente para você poder aprender todas as skills da '' árvore '' da sua classe.\n\nA quantidade em termos de itens são poucas, porém há muitas variações de um mesmo item, incluindo raros,lendários e os sets ( que fazem parte de um combo de equipamentos ).\n\nNo jogo também são incluídas facções, que é possível se juntar,assim obtendo mais sidequests e seguir a mainquest dessas facções, são ao total 7 facções no jogo. Descubra por si mesmo auhauhau\n\nHá também as cartas, que são obtidas de várias maneiras, e oferecem ao jogador bônus exclusivos, como maior dano, regeneração de vida, e por ai vai.\nDentro desse esquema existem também as lorestones, que contam poesias e poemas sobre Amalur, achando um set completo de lorestones, você ganha bônus para algo específico também,\n\n\nFalei muito bem dele até agora, mas KoA contém seus pontos negativos também.\n\nUm deles é o Summon da skill de Mago, que aparentemente não fica maior ou mais parrudo quanto mais ele upa, ele aprende novos combos para abater os inimigos. Achei diferente, porém estou acostumado com os summons parrudos do Diablo II, auahuahuah.\nOutra coisa são os personagens, todos são muito bonitinhos, coloridos, mas isso é o estilo do jogo mesmo, mas é impossível você ficar horrendo no jogo, é mais fácil ficar com uma aparência bizonha e estranha.\n\nAlém disso, tem certos NPCs extremamente fracos em relação a personalidade, uns 70% do jogo, então não espere muito deles. Claro que tem alguns que te acompanham pelo resto do jogo, que obviamente vão estar bem melhores que os outros.\n\nNão há companions permanentes, só temporários.\n\nBUGS malignos, como som atrasado, acontecem algumas vezes, ou também o jogo fica mudo, mas volta ao normal.\n\nFInalizando, KoA é um daqueles RPGs que você com certeza não bota fé por não seguir os estilos clássicos como FF, Tactics Ogre, Diablo II, ES,etc.\nMas, mostra por um lado, uma obra prima que conseguiu colocar o combate como maior foco do jogo, coisa que poucos não focam e muitos gostariam de ver a ação tomar '' ao vivo '', um mundo incrível para explorar, itens para achar e melhorar e seu personagem, e principalmente, um caminho a escolher para o seu Destino.\n\n8/10.","September 8, 2013","true","60.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This is one of my all time favorite RPG games. The battles can be a bit repetative and you can count on your enemy throwing the same fight combo at you time and time again (which makes it pretty easy to get those parry achievements) The story line is huge! and there is so much to do in this game which brings me to my first complaint... the level cap :( You can reach the level cap by just doing the main factions. The first time i beat the main story line i was a little bummed to learn of the level cap. I mean who doesnt like to watch their XP sky rocket when you finally beat that main pain in the a** boss?! However, i just started a new game, leveled up the weapons i knew i loved and kept on going.\nSometimes the camera view got a bit wonky, its hard to fight when the camera decides to view only the ground lol but it is possible. Just a slight annoyance.\n\nThe open world is also huge! There are tons of side quests to keep you busy for quite awhile. I love the Fast Travel option, which lets be honest, who doesnt just love spending half the game walking from end of the map to other?! (insert sarcastic gaze) Fast Travel really really helps with a map that is this big.\nI downloaded The Teeth of Narcos DLC after i beat the game the first time. It's okay.... The underground sewer is a bit of a maze and isnt as "open" as the main game map, but it's still pretty fun. Again, it brings up the level cap that sucks....\n\nThe game says Partial Controller Support but after 200 somthing hours i would have to say that its pretty much full controller.

Personally I saw the closest resemblance to World of Warcraft with its visuals and questing system. However, this is no clone of a game. It has a unique identity that, in part, is made from borrowing successful traits from these other titles. What stands out most strongly to me about Kingdoms of Amalur is its narrative and world lore. It presents fresh ideas and throughout my 95+ hours (including 210 quests completed) with the game it always felt consistent, like the developers shared a unified vision of what they wanted this world to be.\n\nWithout discussing any specific plot points, I'll say that things begin on a high note and intrigued me right off the bat with a mystery surrounding who this character you are playing as is. It is a special feat in my mind to be able to have a personalized, voiceless protagonist that you are expected to project yourself into also have a predetermined, very interesting back story of their own. Too often these types of characters are just a boring blank slate.\n\nMy sense of progression through this world was wonderful. Your journey begins far from a major warzone and consequently you merely hear stories about it. As you advance closer you begin to see more immediate effects like sons and daughters gone off to fight or altered local economies. Eventually you'll see large refugee camps causing overcrowding problems and burned down towns before reaching the warfront itself. By and large, the settings you visit along the way stand apart from each other both visually and in local story. The exceptions to this are some of the dungeons that look and play very similarly, just with different layouts and quest objectives to fulfill. For a game already so big I think it would have benefited from cutting some of them out.\n\nAll dialogue is voice acted and of good quality. There is some noticeable reuse of voice actors among NPCs, but that is excusable for a game of this size. I would rather see good voice actors reused than bad voice actors brought in in greater numbers.\n\nCombat, unfortunately, is just adequate. There isn't enough depth here to stay compelling throughout. There is a nice mix of weapon types that all control very differently, but you're likely to pick one or two early on and stick with them. Magic brings some cool spells to the fray but are very limited in number. Leveling up is a good, customizable system that does gradually add new abilities, but not enough to keep things from going stale. To be clear, I never got to a point of hating battles. However, a combination of things getting too easy by the end, the long length of the game and repetition of enemy types eventually sucked a lot of the enjoyment out of it. I will warn you that it is possible to become over leveled if you do all side quests as you find them. Google "Amalur Wiki overlevel" to find a guide for avoiding this.\n\nI'll wrap things up with a few more minor critiques. Loot is dealt out in such volume that inventory management becomes a chore (similar to many Diabloesque games). Despite this abundance of gear it was surprisingly infrequent how often I found something better than what I was wearing. Also, before long I had more money than things to do with it. I play most games on Normal difficulty, including this one, but didn't find enough challenge here so I suggest playing on Hard to most players. The orchestral score was competently produced but lacked the artistry to make it memorable.\n\nOverall, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a fantastic, expansive experience that could have benefited from seeing its great length reined in a little bit.","February 25, 2015","true","98.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The combat is fantastic. I only played as a warrior, but the moves were so stylish, and made you feel so powerful, that I never got tired of fighting. The challenge is kept consistent all the way through, and the gameplay and character customization overshadow the admitably awful story and characters (that fortune-teller dude that follows you throughout the game is badass, though, as is your gnome buddy). I strongly recommend this. One playthrough, including DLC, will get you 50+ hours, and it is certainly replayable.","February 1, 2014","true","110.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Amalur: Reckoning, has become a favorite in a matter of moments, to me.\n\nIf you are in search of a story-backed, heavily armored RPG, or something to bring an emotional (and nostalgic) rememberance to you. THIS IS IT!\nKingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has brought back to me the same nostalgia of games such as, Fable, Morrowind, and other timeless classics that brought in a new era of RPG gaming.\n\n9.3/10 Story\n8/10 Graphics\n10/10 Content\n8/10 UI/Combat Mechanics\n10/10 Replay Value\n\nThe story is unique and enthralling from my point of view as the player, many bonds formed in the game. Reckoning has an exciting amount of information to learn for almost every NPC character as well, there is lots to learn, and always a bonus!\n\nGraphics are intriguing, lots of intuitive graphic inspirations which look and feel similar to games such as WoW, Prince of Persia, Fable 2, and The Last Remnant.\n\nI could not ask for ANY more content from this game, personally. The content that has been provided, is incredible. It takes a keen eye to see all the little details put into the fabrics of this game, and there is a bountiful amount of things to do in this game, never boring.\n\nAs for the UI of this game, it's not "clunky" or "misplaced", but it definitely could have been shown off a little more.\nSpeaking for this in a comparison, it would land closer to an original inspired UI, such as Dark Souls. Relatively simple to navigate, and basically gets the job done. Could have been better, but I've seen worse.\n\nCombat in this game lands incredibly close to that of a Fable game, the particles of Magic based skills/attacks are very similar to the style of that series. And the combat feel is smooth, and aaalmost clean. It has a bit of register and error when it comes to trying to scroll between weapons when you want to, and when you want to aim at an enemy while moving backwards, something that comes with most games. Just need to remember that these things occur. The actual skills and devices of combat in this game feel familiar to Continent of The Ninth Seal (C9 by Webzen), the skills are incredible and awe-inspiring!\n\nI really feel at home with this game, and there is always something new to accomplish, or experiment with. Lots to tinker with, lots of different ways to go about doing one single thing. Always new possibilities for your character progression, and every class tree is fun to play with. Needless to say this game userped the throne of my RPG Top 10.\n\nFeel like this game is for you? It should. It is worth the full price, believe me. It is always nice to get it on sale, just don't waste any time NOT playing this game :)","February 1, 2014","true","11.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/recommended/102500/","linibot","Lin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/","556 products in account","Solid old fashioned RPG fun.\nThat's the description I keep thinking about all the time I've been playing. In fact I'm having too much fun to admit this game has flaws - which it definitely does but I just don't care. Because there's that itch and it's being thoroughly scratched, and if you need proof just start counting how many times I'm about to use the word fun. ;) And if counting isn't your thing, there is an actual demo (shocking, I know), so ignore me and try the game yourself.\n\nSo why is it fun? Being able to mix and match any class you can come up with is fun. Respeccing anytime you feel like it (for a fee) is fun. The loot is good, diverse and stays interesting. Exploration is very much rewarded. And alone these elements mean: "I just found an interesting legendary item in a chest behind a weird crevice that I had no reason to go to, but it's not for my build. Let me respec for a moment and try it out". And that's just fun. :)\n\nThis game gets compared to Skyrim a lot (and trashed for that reason), but it does combat, classes and abilities so much better than Skyrim. For starters, the combat is actually entertaining. Gets a bit on the easy side if you hunt down the side quests, but it feels satisfying and enjoyable - neither unnecessarily complex nor simple button mashing. There is no huge enemy diversity, but what there is gets the job done in forcing you to try different tactics. Stealth and ranged are rather disadvantaged systems because of how often enemies mob you, but magic is really well done, sword play and daggers are fun, and some of the more interesting weapons, like the middle-range chakrams and the faeblades, have been given a lot of love. In fact all classes and class mixes work well (stealthy assassins aside), which doesn't happen often enough in RPGs, so feel free to create the weirdest mix you ever came up with.\n\nThe crafting systems don't reinvent the wheel but they are both intuitive to use and deep enough: The alchemy is useful and the experimenting process works well, blacksmithing admittedly becomes a bit obsolete on higher levels, and gem crafting is more or less what you'd expect, but still helpful with later game weapons.\n\nThe map is big without feeling unmanageable, and there's a lot of game there: many side quests, some with follow ups, much to discover if you just run down a random path in the forest, long main quests and a decent number of mostly smaller dungeons that manage not to be too boring. So length-wise this is a fair value for money proposition, but it's also not so long that it overstays its welcome.\n\nI'm also really enjoying the story, but it won't be for everyone. If you ever read anything by R.A. Salvatore (Drizzt from Forgotten Realms, DemonWars, etc) you will know what to expect: Pulp, generic fantasy, with occasional interesting flashes, decent if not overly original world-building and lore, a "working writer's" kind of prose, but rather enjoyable nonetheless - if you like that kind of stuff. Personally I am loving it, but the disclaimer remains. Just don't expect real choices or fancy dialog trees.\n\nAll in all, there's not too much to complain about. There are the occasional problems with weird camera angles, the way maps deal with over-/underpasses can be annoying, and that dispelling rythm mini-game you have to use to unlock some chests was a really bad design idea. But those are just pet peeves. I encountered no weird bugs or crashes, the game runs smoothly on a low to mid range computer, and the UI is workable. Both controller and mouse/keyboard played fine for me, so pick your poison.\n\nSo in case you still didn't get my memo, Kindoms of Amalur is simply fun to play. :) If you like traditional crpgs with a bit of an MMO aroma (just without the pesky other humans around), ignore the horrible name and give the demo a try.\n","May 14, 2015","true","129.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its an rpg that lets you skill what you want, in  3 skill trees. Missions are always the same, ala kill this or bring this, or collect this and that, but mostly they have somekind like a story or a background, and some of them are really interestening. The fighting system is quick, fast and based on blocking or dodging. It needs a bit of balance, since i think this game is too easy, and only enemys with much life are annoying because you need really much time to kill them even tough they dont give a threat. But the atmosphere, is fantastic. It looks like in a (bloody) fairy world. R.A Salvatore, made a interestening story,also reminds me some of the dragonworld saga from him. The repetetive missions and gameplay(you come into a new place, there is somewhat a problem, you solve it , or not, and advance further ) is the only thing i dont like about the game thats why its just an "okay" game.\n\n5/10","June 7, 2014","true","54.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And this demo game gave me a good time. So i bought this one.\n\nAnyway that's personal history. :) Return to the subject, 'KOA' presents the new fantasy world about 'Rule of Cycle', 'Immortal Fea', 'Crystal War', 'Fateless One'... and so on. And these things are showed with beautiful graphic (not mean good quality).\n\nAlso this game contains many thing to do. After tutorial, you will be faced a lot of quests. Even sometimes these quests make me confusing. You can collect regents or shards to create potions or gems. And you can breakdown equipment and salvage gears to make weapons or armors.\n\nAnd battle system is good. Even this is a RPG game. You can against your enemy by combo, air combo, combat ability and reckoning mode. Various weapons, skills, destinies (like specialized jobs) give you joyful choice. Even you think 'I made a wrong choices', don't worry, you can return to level 1 with all skill points. And reckoning mode is awesome, you become a powerful one and you can do fate-shift (like finish blow). I always felt catharsis when i finished a strong enemy by fate-shift.\n\nBut 'KOA' also has bad things. First and Worst thing is '38 Studios (developer of 'KOA') was closed without 'KOA' licence sold. That means no more updates, DLCs and 'Kingdoms of Amalur II' :(\n\nAnd character customization is awful. May be, you have bad feeling, when you make your player. Because character customization has very little selections to make your face. Then your worry become a problem of game play. You can see  a NPC what have exactly same your face with different hair color. But that's not a problem, i can imagine he is a my doppelganger or unknown my brother who was seperated at childhood (in game story). But real problem is same faces NPCs are too many to focus story line. For example, You will meet a mentor who guide you in arcana faction quest, and he will send you to the archimage. (I skip many things to prevent spoiler). Then... you will see a same mentor face archimage with white hair. WTF, Even they are major NPCs of faction quest, they have same face!!! except hair color!!!! This problem will teases you until final battle.\n\nOther thing is the low level cap. If you are a person who complete all quest in the game (not repeat quests), you can reach level 40 (max level), soon. In my case, i could reach level 40 after siege of mel senshir. Probably i could do that because i finished 'The Legend of Dead Kel' and 'Teeth of Naros' before cross the ocean. Then i lost my purpose of side quests and battles. Level cap must be higher than level 40 to make player can push forward.\n\nAnyway 'KOA' is a good RPG game. If it was not, i didn't get all achievements of this game. 'KOA' is a new IP game what has potential to be a great franchise game. But it's a shame, future of 'KOA' is unclear.","February 1, 2015","true","100.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Sadly it did not.\n\nThe action in the game is quite good, one as to be on their toes when fighting multiple monters/enemies. But sadly it gets repetitive.\n\nThe monsters that you encounter in beginning will be the same ones that you encounter at the very end. All they do is call them different things. Example: "Weak boggart in the beginning versus Strong Boggart" in the end.\n\nThe characters are forgettable, some of them really even have no business being in the plot.\n\nThe quests are fun at first but then they just devolve into "go here, kill 5 wolves, come back"\n\nThe plot is interesting and seemingly original at first but by half way into the story it just turns into total garbage. The main antagonist isn't even that interesting. His dialogue is terrible, one dimensional, and repetitive. The voice acting of him is done by what sounds like a sick old man.\n\nAnd everyone talks to you as if you have NO POWER at all, despite the constant acts you carry out that continually prove that you have god like powers.\n\nI literally killed a demon the size of a 6 story building in one part of the story, only for the antagonist to talk to me afterwards as if I was some weak puppy that had the strength of an ant. Even one of your friends in the story acts like she could beat you down any time she wants, even though you constantly kick 500 times more butt than she ever could.\n\nThe endgame is no fun, not even a challenge. Once you get past a certain level and can make your own gear, you pretty much sleep walk through the late stages of the game.\n\nI did my first playthrough of this game on HARD and I killed the final boss in 4 hits... yes you read that right, 4 hits. The difficulty on this game is a total joke.\n\nI would only recommend this game for kids, if you are a seasoned RPG or action game players, this will be a serious let down.","July 9, 2015","false","50.6"," 36 of 69 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","36","69","2","1"

Why the ♥♥♥♥ would I say ONLY? The game has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (200+ hours) of content in sidequests and other content. 200 HOURS!! That's right, crazy.\n\nSo you're sold on the ammount of content, right? But what of the QUALITY. Well, I can confirm each quest, especially a ton of the side quests, has an interesting and unique story that fits into the huge ammount content in this lore filled world. Many of the side quests I've seen allow for alternate rewards and task changing interaction through fully voice-acted dialogue based around your pursuasion (charisma in other games) skill. (Making tue skill actually useful, unlike some games.)\n\nThe character destiny cards systems encourages awesome hyhbrids of different combat styles and abilities from the three main branches where you can invest ability points. These cards are unlocked based on what trees you invest your AP to add bonus stats and even complete changes to your abilities to make yourself into the exact blend of abilities and strengths you desire.\n\nThe combat itself introduces a number of skill based fighting mechanics that never seem to lose their weighty and epic feel. This is only added to in the fact that you can make any number of crazy class combinations to tailor your combat experience. Not to mention the weapon and gear options that are also complimented by the epic skills system.\n\nThe complexity and depth added in the alchemy, blacksmithing, detect hidden, dispelling, lockpicking, mercantile, pursuasion, sagecraft, and stealth skills furthurs the great sense of benefit you get from investing in one skill each level. Each skill builds to greater perks as you invest furthur along in one particular skill, but the gut wrenching decisions you face in deciding where to invest next are what makes you realize the importance of each skill, and the role they serve.\n\nThe progression of the game overall is at pretty much whatever pace you play at. If you want to rush to train for that next ability, do it. You will be fine, although you might want to bring some extra potions. If instead you want to do some side quests and join guilds for added benefits and rewards, do it. In fact, you can maintain a balance of both.\n\nThe only qualm (not even that) I have is that if you progress to a furthur area and return to do some quests, they can in some cases seem too easy after becoming more powerful. Which, I don't see it really as a game flaw, because it is just the nature of the RPG genre. For example: after having defeated a dragon and then returning to kill some slimes of any typical rpg would be a walk in the park.\n\nI've been through just the tip of the iceberg, and there lies a journey of trials and triumph awaiting you. So,\nplease buy this game, not for me, but yourself. You'll be glad you did.","June 14, 2014","true","33.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game really does appeal to almost every sense of a great fantasy game: combat, exploration, interaction, etc. The camera could be a bit tricky as it did tend to fling around easily, but later in my playing I found that to be beneficial and detrimental to me in combat as pushing a key in the direction you want to attack and not the way the camera faced could be confusing at times, but I adapted.\n\nThe greatsword is by far the most fun weapon to play with in my opinion. I love games where they truly allow a greatsword to shine- where, when the blade hits something, it hits something. Striking multiple enemies and moving between them all in between swings feels extremely satisfying and really does give you a feel for that fanstical combat with monsters. The animations for many of the weapons are strong indeed, the only weapon I truly disliked were the hammers. Slow, clunky and short range. Staves, chakrams, and faeblades all look and feel very cool to use. Attacking and switching between weapons cancelled combo's and would allow you to be much more variable in combat.\n\nThe only things that I felt lacked were indepth, meaningful conversation with people, romance and how empty and underused many towns were. Now, no romance isn't necessarally a bad thing, but for rpg's it should be a given- everyone likes it and if you don't, well, you're wrong.\n\nMight is right.","January 17, 2015","true","33.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whilst the map feels vastly underpopulated and it is obvious from the design of the surroundings that this was intended to be a MMORPG, I think that adds a certain charm. Feeling tiny in a world so huge is part of the experience.\nIt did take me a while to get fully into the lore, and I wouldn't say I'm quite there yet, but you can certainly play the game without understanding the fuss about these 'Fae' or why everyone argues over this 'Mitharu' fellow.\nThe DLCs are absolutely fantastic and expand what is already a vast, multi-faceted world. The creativity behind this game is evident in every last corner.\nThough the character customisation is limited, that is probably a good thing, as I like to spend hours upon hours getting my hero's eyebrows JUST RIGHT.\nIt's also worth mentioning that the customisation extends into gameplay; the class system is, in my opinion, without fault. It's user-friendly, it enables users to play whatever combination of skillsets they choose, and it has a system of specialisation that other RPGs, I felt, were missing.\nAll in all, buy the game.

I'm going to break this into parts: Presentation, Story, and Gameplay.\n\nGraphically and artistically the game is fine. Nothing about the monsters stand out, but nothing seems phoned in. There are no slow downs. Sound design is fine and the voice acting isn't too bad but....\n\n....The cutscenes have that dreaded eagle-eye stare. It's like Oblivion except worse. Additionally, the music is fine until you start fighting people. The combat music is exactly the same for every encounter, even the nobody stuff that you can one hit. The only two times I've seen the music change is when you are fighting the Tuatha or a boss. The two other songs are better and actually have some love put into them.\n\nThe biggest and most glaring problem is the camera. I'll discuss it below with gameplay.\n\nThe story is about.. um... The elves-I mean Fae! The Fae are broken up into factions and they are timeless, ageless.. yadda yadda. One group, the Winter Fae, has broken off into a new group, the Tuatha, who believe they are bringing a new god into the world. You, the player, are killed and brought back to live by the Well of Souls.\n\nHere's where the game gets interesting story wise: Since you were brought back to life, you are no longer tied to the shackels of fate. You can choose your own destiny and change the fate of the... Wait a second, this sounds a lot like Raziel from the Legacy of Kain series. In fact, the concept is exactly the same. With real free will, your character is supposed to change the world. This works really well in the world, and it plays nice.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is flawed. This game was clearly rushed out because a lot of it has zero consideration. Polish wise, everything functions, but there are a lot of things that are out of place. It's really, really easy to gain gold, to the point that you can respect everything into crafting abilities to make new gear, then respec back to your combat stuff. Don't bother with the warrior or mage trees at all, just make a finese character because the dual weapons + bow and arrows are literally the best weapons in the game. By 10 hours in, you'll have so much gold you can easily respect to fit your builds.\n\nNow, developers, I have a question for you: Does making the game world bigger make it better? Lemme answer for you.. NO!!!! Reckoning has a low run speed.. But so did Skyrim! But here's the thing... Every time you enter a new area, there are 3~5 new quests to do and they are all the same. Unlike Skyrim, there's no reason to explore areas UNLESS you have a quest. Since everything gives you XP (literally, everything does), you'll run into a problem where everything gets too easy too quickly. I highly recommend playing the game on hard, otherwise it will be too easy. You'll also encounter a problem where you discover an entirely new area that has more quests in it but... everyuthing in the area has a gray name because you were over leveled by the previous area.\n\nThe big areas are worse with the mini-map and the camera. The Minimap has that problem Final Fantasy XIV had where the only areas you can run are drawn or emphasises. Since there are invisible walls around the edges, the big massive world turns into whatever is pictured on the minimap. The camera only makes this worse because you have to manually aim up to see how vast everything is. It auto-levels to a downward angle of the player whenever you move.\n\nTechnically speaking, Reckoning is also a Fable clone for combat. You can hit stuff, shoot stuff. It works just fine. But as I have stated above, there's only one real viable option: The finese route. You can mix and choose, like I did for my original 30hours on Origin, but you will HAVE to use the finese armor and skills because they simply do so much output.\n\nIf you can withstand, avoiding some quests so you can focus on the main quests, the game isn't that bad. Combat can be fun when it isn't insulting easy; and the MAIN story quests and the FACTION quests are worth the time. Just only pay $10~15. Be sure to get the DLC for the quests; but not those extra weapons because they will be replaced within your first two hours of play.","December 12, 2014","true","28.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics plus characters are lovely and the world is as many-sided as it is dangerous. You can do a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of sidequests which sometimes makes you forget what you are supposed to do, but personally, I love that about my openworld RPGs. After 20 hours of playing this game (yet again since I started it when I came out but started over again here on steam) and completing all sidequests so far, I can say that this game is totally underrated and has a lot to offer.\nPersonally I don't share the opinion that this was crappily adapted from the consoles. I've seen far worse adaptions over the years and it's really easy to get along with this one; of course, sometimes you might encounter situations in the menue where you definitely clicked on "Load" instead of "Save" but who the hell cares about that anyway. Go back and make sure you click the right one xD\nI haven't encountered any bugs or problems with the game so far; not now and not when I played it back when it was released for the computer.\nSo anybody who likes RPGs and open-world and a ridiculously interesting story: You should really buy this!","February 4, 2014","true","54.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoyed it, and if you've played Skyrim to death and want something similar in a different setting, this should fit the bill. Lots of decent quests along with the usual grindy tasks as well.  However, the DLC is only so-so and does not come with a level cap increase, so only buy if it's really cheap and you just want to have more to do in the Amalur world. The combat is hack and slash style al a God of War and that ilk. Button mashy, but there are special moves and it's easy to pick up.

Few other games (outside of Skyrim, because that's in a league of its own) can deliver this well, if at all. Even the storyline plays into this aspect of the game which I found to be pretty damn clever. Plus, if you don't like your current skill set, you can pay some gold and change it. And the gold amount needed is relatively small considering your resetting your skills.\n\nThe Bad: The voice acting is painfully bad in some cases which can be really annoying. Also, while the mixing and matching I mentioned above is great, combining classes (i.e. rogue and mage) can be a nuisance since it takes an excessive amount of time to get to the next skill tier. There is such a thing a TOO MUCH balance.\n\nThe Ugly: I found the crafting system to be borderline pathetic. Minimal depth to it and using a skill doesn't improve it at all but merely gives miniscule generic experience. On another note, the quests often spread themselves out too much forcing you to traverse half the map to complete many quests rather early in the game.\n\nLong story short, if you want a fun, easy to play RPG with some unique quirks (good ones at that), then pick this game up!","December 24, 2014","true","30.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198120348704/recommended/102500/","76561198120348704","richard.mckinney4","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198120348704/","53 products in account","So I bought this game a few months ago, not expecting much.  Honestly, I was expecting it to be one of those games I play for a couple of days and then lose interest in.  I was very wrong on that account.  This is actually one of the best, if not the best, RPGs that I have ever played.  There were a few cons of course, but I will get to that in a little bit.\n\nBecause The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was the last RPG I played before this game, I could not help but to make comparisons during my entire time playing this.  In terms of graphics, I found Amalur to be far superior than Oblivion.  When you are walking in caves and you see all of the flora just come to life as you walk past, it is just captivating.\n\nIn terms of story line, I would say that they are about equal, but then again, I have not gotten all that far in Oblivion's storyline (I spend most of my time doing the side quests, build my character up some for the really tough bosses).  If I compared Amalur to Morrowind however, I would pick Amalur's storyline anytime.  Because unlike Morrowind, in which the storyline has you do all of these tasks to the point that it feels crazy, Amalur is fairly straightforward.\n\nVoice-acting, I don't really care for.  But from what I can tell, the voice of the characters in Amalur tends to have this almost...ghostly quality?  Almost like you are hearing someone in another room rather than them talking right next to you.  I guess you will either love it or hate, but for me?  I was indifferent.\n\nThere are plenty of side quests to take part in, just like in Oblivion.  Like Oblivion, you can take part in faction quests.  Like if you want to be the head of a Mage's guild in Oblivion, then you can do the same for Amalur.  However, while it it can take a few days or so to finish a faction quest in Oblivion, you can knock them out in Amalur in like, a day because the quests are so much easier and there are fewer actual quests to complete for the faction.\n\nThere is a huge variety of character customization.  Do you want to play a male or female character?  Go ahead.  Do you want to play as an Elf or a Human?  Go ahead.  If memory serves me right, then I think there are four races to select in Amalur, but the building of the skill-set does not occur until you actually start game play.  Like you do not decide immediately if you want to make your character a mage.  You can decide where you want to place your character's skill alignment later on and even then, you are fully able to go back and change your character's style whenever you want.  If you decide you want a hammer wielding mage, but decide later that you want to have a magic wielding thief or warrior, then you can do that.\n\nI guess now I can get into the overall pro's and con's.\n\nPro's\n\n-Absolutely amazing graphics\n- Wide skill-set available\n-You can change your skill-set whenever you want with no consequences other than what your character can or cannot wear or what they can do in combat.\n-Game play tends to be fluid and smooth, particularly with the combat.  You can dodge-roll or teleport out of the way of an attack and the game is not in first-person so you can see more.   I will get to con's later\n-Once the main storyline is complete, you can still continue on side-quests\n-Items will not weigh more than others.  While some weapons will impact attack speed, they will still only occupy one item slot in your backpack.  For example, your hammer, while slower in combat than your daggers, will still occupy the same space in your backpack as the daggers.\n-There is a hide-helmet option so that even if your character wears a hood or helmet, you will not see it in game play yet you will still have the effects.  I personally loved this feature.\n-Easier than Oblivion, but the boss fights can still crush you if you are not ready\n-Good enough that it deserves a sequel\n-My overall verdict?  I enjoy this game way more than Oblivion.\n\nCon's\n\n-Camera angles tend to lag every once in a while, to the point where you might have difficulty seeing an enemy\n-Character may freeze while running.  As in your character will just stop moving while running.  This can be overcome by rolling or teleporting, but it can be troublesome to freeze in the middle of a fight.  Also, this freezing will occur A LOT, and as such you will be rolling or teleporting almost all the time.  It took a couple of days for this to occur to me though.\n-Voice-acting is so-so.\n-From what I have heard, you can only reach level 41.  That is it.  But you can still reset your skill points later on.  Keep in mind though that this means you will not be able to completely max out all skills and abilities.\n-I have had difficulty completing a side-quest because every time I try, the game shuts down.  I do need to give it another try though.\n-Last I checked, the company that developed this game went bankrupt.  So do not expect a sequel or any patches.\n\nOverall, I say check this out.  I got it for $9.99 and this game was most definitely worth the price.  It is fun, beautiful, and the ability to change your skill-set helps to take away the pressure of having to stick with one field.\n","December 21, 2014","true","105.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was kind of like the epidemic of everyone telling you over and over again to watch Breaking Bad. "You don't watch Breaking Bad!!! YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!" and from 100 different people each week until you finally just give in and watch it and realise what the heck you was missing! This game was like that. Every corner I turn I was hearing "Have you played Reckoning yet??" "Dude you have to play Reckoning, Seriously!" So I finally said heck with it and bought it. And there has not been one single shred of regret. You may know how it is to have a ton of games you have purchased in your steam library and you play one for a while and get bored and go to the next for a while. And with so many games you can't fully get into one certain game. And kind of wish you was stuck with just one game so you would be forced to enjoy it without feeling like you are missing out somewhere else. Well this game here has pretty much did that for me. Because there is no other game out there right now comparable to this so my Steam library might as well only have reckoning on the list. One of those games where you are thinking about it constantly when you are out of the house and soon as you walk in the door you push the button on the computer to get it prepped for some playage. If you are an RPG and or Hack and Slash fan this game will be your best friend. You will be buying the T-Shirts and watching youtube videos and drinking out of a reckoning coffee cup you purchased from china off ebay. It really is a great game.

You'll also encounter a problem where you discover an entirely new area that has more quests in it but... everyuthing in the area has a gray name because you were over leveled by the previous area.\n\nThe big areas are worse with the mini-map and the camera. The Minimap has that problem Final Fantasy XIV had where the only areas you can run are drawn or emphasises. Since there are invisible walls around the edges, the big massive world turns into whatever is pictured on the minimap. The camera only makes this worse because you have to manually aim up to see how vast everything is. It auto-levels to a downward angle of the player whenever you move.\n\nTechnically speaking, Reckoning is also a Fable clone for combat. You can hit stuff, shoot stuff. It works just fine. But as I have stated above, there's only one real viable option: The finese route. You can mix and choose, like I did for my original 30hours on Origin, but you will HAVE to use the finese armor and skills because they simply do so much output.\n\nIf you can withstand, avoiding some quests so you can focus on the main quests, the game isn't that bad. Combat can be fun when it isn't insulting easy; and the MAIN story quests and the FACTION quests are worth the time. Just only pay $10~15. Be sure to get the DLC for the quests; but not those extra weapons because they will be replaced within your first two hours of play.","December 12, 2014","true","28.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game's problems lie in its large vision, where for various reasons was left only half fulfilled. It had the frameworks for a great game, but just that, the frameworks.\n\nThe mechanics were there, but as a new IP they shot big, aimed wide, but in the end it was all just superficial and lacked depth. There wasn't any wonder in exploration and the lack of trully likable/charming characters comes off as a sore point. Had it been an indie title it would have been best indie wRPG ever, but sadly it was marketed as a AAA game from the get-go and as-such was set to fail by the buisnessmen in suits who weren't brave enough to aim smaller.\n\nMaybe if the development didn't start-stop so many times, if BigHugeGames didn't get passed between 3 different owners, and Ken Rolston (former Lead Designer of both Oblivion and Morrrowind) was able to complete his original vision we may have had one of the greatest wRPGs in recent memory... alas that is not the case and what we got was KoA:R.

Not only the control feels smooth, you are also given so much freedom to find your own play style. You can equip any two weapons and four spells at a time, and you can mix them however you want in combat. Not to mention the weapon crafting system and the gem crafting/socketing system that further enchance the customzation. Either you want to be Gandalf or Geralt of Rivia, it's all up to you. There are also classes, or Destinies, for you to choose and change at any time.\n\nOne thing I don't like is the dodging. It's hard to find the right timing to dodge an incoming attack, at least for me. I think it is caused by the slight delay before your character makes a dodge, or I just suck at dodging. Hey, guess what, I can also block with my shield and it doesn't take a weapon slot.\n\nThe blend of sword and magic and the stylish art style remind me of the Fable series. As far as combat goes, KOA:R definitely does it better than the Fable series. However I don't find KOA:R's story is intriguing enough for me. "Wow your fate is blank" "You'll save the world" blah blah blah. I still enjoy the gameplay, at least.\n\nOne last thing, you can hide your helmet!! 10/10","June 29, 2014","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

More than just a hack-and-slash, this game encourages you to consider particular approaches for particular enemies based on their weapon type and behavior.

Combined with a wide variety of spells and special abilities, you have numerous options for engaging with a particular enemy, or multiple enemies at once.\n\nIt was hard to really get a feel for my character, though, since it is clear that in order to complete quests and gain experience, there is a very particular sort of person your character is supposed to be. More options for how to complete certain quests would have been nice.\n\nOverall though, it was a great experience and my first playthrough lasted 78 hours.

The story makes you realize how people live their lives knowing their end, their fate, their imminent demise or wonderous growth. The storyline itself is immpecable and is one of the best I have ever played through. You can play your character the way you want, you can choose your own destiny and you have absolute control over other people's destinies, as it is revealed to you. Gives you the feeling of a demi-god, so to say !\n\nAs far as any shortcomings go, there are only a couple. Owing to the fact that it's an open world game, so the amount of resources and items present are uncountable, so if there was a steady offline guide, telling you about each of said items, that would have been fantastic. Some might say that would spoil the experience of figuring out things, but that's my opinion. The other shortcoming is that the amount of running around that you have to do initially, can really tire someone in real life(Don't worry, your character won't be tired though!) and it becomes quite the task running around from one place to another. That said, the running around gives you an ample opportunity to explore Amalur and deviate from quests, thus making the experience very non-linear. Since there are, in fact, as I quote SSoHPKC, "a butt-ton of quests", you will never be short of them and will always have something or the other to do as you progress through the game.\n\nIn conclusion, you have to play this game for the experience and the gameplay that you honestly, will not find anywhere else.  I regret not playing it when it came out, but you should buy it while it's still on sale ! It is definitely worth the small amount.","April 20, 2014","true","135.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

By doing this you're unbound by fate and are free to do whatever you want. You can then influence the already set fate of others. For example, the elves are fated and prophesised to die, but you can turn up and save them anyway. The whole fate idea is really interesting and the gameplay is super fun. Also choose magic. Magic dwarfs every other method of combat, plus chakrams are ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.\n\nThe game didn't really get good reviews and I'm sure there are reasons for that, but I can't seem to remember what was so bad about it, because I remember it being good.","May 5, 2013","true","32.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters are pretty wooden, although they try to add some humor, that said the most humor I have is smashing down anyone, yes you can smash down almost every character. This can detriment the game a little, I smashed some people in a market and missed the chance at an inventory, but at the same time I smashed some blind followers on an island and got good armor.\n\nI found one breaking bug on the Dead Kel DLC, didn't bother me too much cause the game is so fun, also take it of full screen mode but keep the native resolution to reduce the frame rate issues, it doesn't actually take it out of full screen  but solves issues.\n\nWhat I like is that it doesn't try to be realistic or serious, like ahmm, oh no there's a big dragon. You've got dialogue choices where you can belittle characters for taking themselves too seriously, more fun. I have a sword that's bigger than me and ancient frisbies.\n\nAs I said it's fun and funny, the beasts look incredible and they're diverse, the combat makes you feel like a megalith, you can become very overpowered very quickly, but you can challenge yourself by resetting your class and reassigning points or mixing your class up.\n\nI really enjoy this game, it's fantasy, colorful, full of loot and funny. It constantly reminds you, that you are in a fantasy world and absolutely rips into it if you want.\n\nI disagree it's anything like an MMORPG, it laughs at itself, it laughs at RPG's and then say's cause it's fun and that's the way it's meant to be.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that's bright, energetic, fun and funny, doesn't take itself to seriously, I find that it is a bit like the Borderlands of the fantasy realm with more dialogue choice and I love borderlands.","May 26, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It has a fluid and fun combat system. It has a generic but decent storyline. But best of all, it has good side quests. Some of them are even more interesting then the main storyline at times.\n\nWhat I liked most about Kingdoms of Amalur, personally... was how you could build your character in whatever way you wanted. You were not tied down to any restricted class. But you could cross-class between three different trees. Don't like what you ended up doing? No problem. You can re-spec your character at any time during the game. Gold is no object, as there seems to be an over abundance of it in the game. I finished the game with over 6 million pieces of dosh. If that gives you any idea how much money you can make in this.\n\nThe story goes like this. Your character gets killed doing something he or she shouldn't have been. You come back to life by some mysterious means... and you have the ability to control fate. Now it's time for you to go off and save the world. So yeah that's cool and all. We've heard this kind of plot before. But what is best about the game is the journey through it and the quests you undertake throughout. This game has good beefy side quests with rich story and characters. You wont be wasting your time like with a certain other game that just recently came out.. something with Dragons. Dragon Day I think it was called. Anyway, you'll find that there is a ton to do in this game. If you're a nut about completion this'll take you a good 100 + hours to complete. SO clear you calender, ya dig?\n\nWeapons are cool. Each weapon has its own unique style and use. I suggest dicking around with all of them and seeing what you like best. I personally enjoyed the chakrams cause you don't see them much in games, and the daggers because they're the only weapons you can do killmoves with on a sneak attack.\n\nThe game has a big flaw however and this is one I don't usually complain about with games.. but it was too easy. At level 20... 40 being the max.. I was nigh invincible. It's too easy! I played on normal difficulty, so I recommend maybe playing on Hard if you're not new to RPG's and third person action games in general.\n\nThe DLCs were both great. Teeth of Narnia & Dead Kenan & Kel had a great storyline and plenty of extra and new content. I'd totally recommend picking up the complete package when it's on sale!\n\nSo am I missing something? Probably. If you have any questions regarding the game, let me know and i'll answer them post haste.\n\nFinale Verdict: (4.4 out of 5)","May 7, 2015","true","130.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In comparison to KoA, Skyrim is similar, but a little less immersive.\n\nThe world of KoA is beautiful. The lore and the main story are well-written, and make the playing even more enjoyable. And the combat is fluid, and fun.\n\nLet's judge.\n\n(COMBAT)\n\nThe primary and secondary weapon system makes it so much easier to transition from a long-range to close-range weapon, or a slow weapon to a fast, or any sort of pairing one can think of. The different types of weapon (Chakrams, Greatsword, Hammer, Longsword, Daggers, Staves, Scepters, Faeblades, and Bows) provide much entertainment in battle.\n\nNo complexity nonsense with the controls. Movements are fluid and there are only 2 buttons. Mashing doesn't always work-- dodging is a necessity, making it less lifeless and more active. I suppose it is a little repetitive, but I find it fun, personally. (I might be wrong.)\n\nAlso, the whole "you choose your own fate" idea makes it easy to go down whatever path you want to, whether it be finesse, sorcery, or might. You can even have hybrid combinations.\n\nCool note: your dodge, if you take the finesse/sorcery route, can be replaced by a short-range teleport, which can later deal poison damage if you teleport through enemies.\n\n(LORE)\n\nYou have what I call "lorestones" scattered all over the world. The loading screens give you tidbits, and the cutscenes are, if nothing else, pretty. Dialogue with NPCs allow you to delve deeper into the story if you want to.\n\nI love the whole fantasy-world-in-danger spin.\n\nAlso, you are "fateless".  You're bound by nothing at all. And you have an uber-super-cool special kill mode.\n\n(GRAPHICS)\n\nI love games with beautiful graphics. Some pixelated games, too, work well, but KoA is far from pixelated. The faces are smooth, the armor and weapons are pretty, and the world is vivid. Walking through the forests or the swamps or the cities is an immersive experience in itself.\n\n(CRAFTING SYSTEM)\n\nYou can salvage items you don't feel like selling for components, which can then be used to forge the weapon of your dreams. Weapon customization at its finest. You can use gems as supplements, and (this is a small thing, but it's great) you can name your carefully crafted weapon, or armor. Name your longsword "Bootybuster" or something. Not that I would.\n\n(THE FINAL VERDICT)\n\nYo, buy this. I was looking for a good RPG for a long while. I bought this along with The Last Remnant (which I also HIGHLY recommend) and found that I loved it.\n\n10/10 <3","April 30, 2015","true","31.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Took me about 190 hours of decent fun. Sorry for my English - not my main. Beware of small spoilers.\n\nGame is HUGE. World is very interesting yet main storyline seems like "I did that few times already". I mean, for example, Fae (naming them just Amalur`s Elves does not give justice to their concept) and their life cycle. How they preserve history and traditions by repeating battles and happenings from long gone past, making them to reappear in endless cycle. Unable to reach for something new. Great and tragic at the same time. House of Ballads storyline is extraordinary. While main quest, tho has its moments, drives us to meat final Great Evil like so many before. Don`t get me wrong - it`s fine but nothing as extraordinary as some other parts of the game.\nI like fighting system. Played melee fighter. You can really create Your own style. And while most enemies can hit hard at the beginning of the game, all of them can be killed. When I died it was always because of my own fault. Problem is, later on there are no real challenges. The only achievement I didn`t get through normal playthrough was the one to kill enemy 4 levels higher then me. Thanks to scalling system I haven`t found one. On the other hand main hero is somewhat unique figure in the world of Amalur so maybe it was intended by devs to make god-like impression.\nCan`t say something about magic - haven`t been using that at all. I really liked minigames of picking locks and dispelling. Crafting is very usefull tho crafted items make game even more easy. So up to after Mel Senshir I used Alchemy to craft potions only. Then I made final tier crafts and my charactered trippeled its stats. So whoever wishes to make game more of a .... hmm no, not challenge.... rather more humanlike - do not craft. Whoever wishes to become one man army+++ please do.\nTo sum up. I spend with this game 190 hours and I`m not masochist. So it means i like it pretty much. For World created, for Lore (mostly unused), for Fae storyline, for Dead Kel, for fighting. for many small things making it great rpg experience. And being god-like figure is not so bad after all ;)","May 21, 2014","true","190.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You come back to life by some mysterious means... and you have the ability to control fate. Now it's time for you to go off and save the world. So yeah that's cool and all. We've heard this kind of plot before. But what is best about the game is the journey through it and the quests you undertake throughout. This game has good beefy side quests with rich story and characters. You wont be wasting your time like with a certain other game that just recently came out.. something with Dragons. Dragon Day I think it was called. Anyway, you'll find that there is a ton to do in this game. If you're a nut about completion this'll take you a good 100 + hours to complete. SO clear you calender, ya dig?\n\nWeapons are cool. Each weapon has its own unique style and use. I suggest dicking around with all of them and seeing what you like best. I personally enjoyed the chakrams cause you don't see them much in games, and the daggers because they're the only weapons you can do killmoves with on a sneak attack.\n\nThe game has a big flaw however and this is one I don't usually complain about with games.. but it was too easy. At level 20... 40 being the max.. I was nigh invincible. It's too easy! I played on normal difficulty, so I recommend maybe playing on Hard if you're not new to RPG's and third person action games in general.\n\nThe DLCs were both great. Teeth of Narnia & Dead Kenan & Kel had a great storyline and plenty of extra and new content. I'd totally recommend picking up the complete package when it's on sale!\n\nSo am I missing something? Probably. If you have any questions regarding the game, let me know and i'll answer them post haste.\n\nFinale Verdict: (4.4 out of 5)","May 7, 2015","true","130.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maybe all of the RPG's have this and I'm just being a noob, but I think it's cool.\n\nIf you want to do all of the quests though, make sure to read a wiki or user guide or something before attempting any of the quests in the Red Marches. If you're not careful, you can prompt this bug that disables "Fast Travel" for the remainder of the game and there's no way to fix it.

Rich lore, interesting storyline, various unique creatures and weapons. There are 3 main playstyles that vary considerably. If you want you can focus on one of the 3 or you can split it up between. There are so many possibilities, cool moves and useful spells. It has a solid blacksmithing and alchemy component to it, as well as something called sagecrafting where you can create gems that will power up your items.\n\nBecause most people are going to know what its like compared to Skyrim I guess I'll have to talk about that. In my opinion the combat is more rich. There's dodging, and blocking with sheilds is actually worth it and plays into your attacks if timed right. Also it feels way less hack and slash than Skyrim, there a different moves that when applied correctly can turn the tide of what might have seemed an unwinnable fight. The game auto-aims for you, but that doesn't detract from the fighting experience at all. The spells are also more interesting than Skyrim's. Skyrim might have more spells but they end up all feeling the same while KoA:R's are all unique and have very powerful uses in certain situations.\n\nKingdoms has an amazing world to explore. It is a bit small compared to Skyrim and doesn't allow for as much freedom (for example you can only jump down from cliffs and walls at certain points on the map) but it is something you get used to and it helps with where the game really excels: combat, because you are channelled towards groups of enemies.\n\nThe graphics are fairly decent and the game runs smoothly. I did run into a bug where you get stuck and cannot move at all and have to fast travel to get out of the place and the general pop in distance for enemies could be a bit longer, perhaps there is a way to change this in the .ini files or something, I'll have to check. The lipsyncing of characters is sometimes off and occassionally they make really awkward movements when speaking, which are a bit immersion breaking. The voice acting is quite good though like all RPGs I really wish they could have used a greater variety of voice actors.\n\nOverall its a great experience and I'm quite addicted to it so far. There are so many choices and I feel as if I will do a bunch of playthroughs with vastly differing character builds to get the whole experience. Oh that brings me to one last thing. You can "unbind your fate" for a relatively cheap gold cost to reset your points. This means if partway through a playthrough you got sick of smashing people with giant swords you could pay a bit of gold and change your character into a stealthy assassin or a flashy mage.","February 10, 2015","true","79.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will grow to love each and every character that you meet in the storyline, but there are some you will grow to hate as well. The Voice-Acting is superb, but the level designs are very hit or miss, some landscapes are beautifully crafted and are visually stunning, but there are some that are very much so lacking in beauty and are very poorly designed, that you'll have to empty out your vomit bag after you clear the area. HOWEVER, this are minor setbacks compared to what this game can offer for only 19.99$, I personally rate it as an 8/10, with it also being one of my favorite games of all times.","April 21, 2014","true","73.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After 20 hours of playing this game (yet again since I started it when I came out but started over again here on steam) and completing all sidequests so far, I can say that this game is totally underrated and has a lot to offer.\nPersonally I don't share the opinion that this was crappily adapted from the consoles. I've seen far worse adaptions over the years and it's really easy to get along with this one; of course, sometimes you might encounter situations in the menue where you definitely clicked on "Load" instead of "Save" but who the hell cares about that anyway. Go back and make sure you click the right one xD\nI haven't encountered any bugs or problems with the game so far; not now and not when I played it back when it was released for the computer.\nSo anybody who likes RPGs and open-world and a ridiculously interesting story: You should really buy this!","February 4, 2014","true","54.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoyed it, and if you've played Skyrim to death and want something similar in a different setting, this should fit the bill. Lots of decent quests along with the usual grindy tasks as well.  However, the DLC is only so-so and does not come with a level cap increase, so only buy if it's really cheap and you just want to have more to do in the Amalur world. The combat is hack and slash style al a God of War and that ilk. Button mashy, but there are special moves and it's easy to pick up.

The story is fairly straightforward, but does offer the player choices, and while many choices are one off events, your actions do change how NPCs at least talk to you or initiate conversations with you. The game does also have some interesting new fantasy ideas, like the Fae, an elf like race that lives by the stories they tell and are destined to repeat throughout their multiple lives.\n\nCombat maintains a nice balance, with different playstyles being perfectly viable, and some fights will require preperation to have a fair chance of getting through them, but there's no major difficulty spikes. Basic crafting trees like alchemy and blacksmithing are included, and blacksmithing has a nice touch where you break down loot to make into other weapons and armor. The world is large and about as open as Oblivion, with only cities and dungeons having their own instances. And lastly, the graphics have a very WoW like feel to them, but far more technically advanced and nicer looking.","February 14, 2014","true","19.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fully voiced, lots of lore, decent story, quests occasionally have options to alter the outcome, graphics are crisp, animations are mostly clean, there's detail in level design, lootz, crafting (optional) and a "double layered" level up system (able to tech into multiple trees and choose one passive perk). In a nutshell it's a dungeon crawler in 3rd person instead of top-down.\n\nPerhaps my favorite part about Amalur aside from above is the feeling of not being tethered to the game in order to notice progression. I can play for just 15 minutes and actually accomplish something.\n\nOn a minor negative note, Amalur does not give the full freedom other games allow. The player can not jump and the player can not decide to step off a cliff on whim; there are set locations to allow dropping into water or down a cliff-side. Fortunately these limitations do not or hinder gameplay.\n\nCombat is straight forward and fairly rewarding. Left click to continue swinging, instill a pause or hold the click to start a special attack. The player can also mix in magic or swap weapons on the fly to make some interesting combos and setups. Though combat may seem too basic the AI does its job in finding those holes in defenses and can manage to really take a chunk of health. While left clicking is easy, positioning amongst groups of enemies is where the player needs to maintain control even though the AI isn't the smartest.\n\nI would recommend Amalur to anybody who likes leveling up and combining classes. The game actually feels like a dungeon crawler but from a behind the shoulder perspective.\n\nI would also highly recommend downloading the YSA mod which balances the game to make Hard mode actually hard and Normal not such an cakewalk.\n\nAdditional Thought: It would be nice if Amalur was coop multiplayer though it does a great job as a singleplayer game.

I find the fae to be a boring race for exemple, bunch of broken record playing the same songs again and again. But it fits the story and the world setting, i just wish there were more diversity in the culture of the world.\n\nREVIEW\n\nThis is a huge game and deserves a long review, but lacking the time suffice to say that it is an excelent RPG, and fairly unique in the way it tastes like an MMO because of its scale.\n\nI am not sure why this title didn't do better, I can't recall but i think at the time it came out there were 3-4 big titles coming out also and they completely overshadowed this game. I guess most people didn't have the budget or the gaming time for another 60$ title.\n\nI only grabbed this recently because it went on sale, and certeinly don't regret it. I got about 90 hours out of it already after finishing it (not a full clear mind you, a lot of quests and some exploration still left over), and I still have the DLCs set aside.\n\nSome advice : If you get slightly bored in your play, respecialize as another class. I went through all the 3 classes in my single playthrough, and it helped keep things fresh. The game certeinly doesn't warrant a playthrough with each class as it would be too repetitive, so might as well experience all classes on the same go.","March 3, 2014","true","93.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I find the fae to be a boring race for exemple, bunch of broken record playing the same songs again and again. But it fits the story and the world setting, i just wish there were more diversity in the culture of the world.\n\nREVIEW\n\nThis is a huge game and deserves a long review, but lacking the time suffice to say that it is an excelent RPG, and fairly unique in the way it tastes like an MMO because of its scale.\n\nI am not sure why this title didn't do better, I can't recall but i think at the time it came out there were 3-4 big titles coming out also and they completely overshadowed this game. I guess most people didn't have the budget or the gaming time for another 60$ title.\n\nI only grabbed this recently because it went on sale, and certeinly don't regret it. I got about 90 hours out of it already after finishing it (not a full clear mind you, a lot of quests and some exploration still left over), and I still have the DLCs set aside.\n\nSome advice : If you get slightly bored in your play, respecialize as another class. I went through all the 3 classes in my single playthrough, and it helped keep things fresh. The game certeinly doesn't warrant a playthrough with each class as it would be too repetitive, so might as well experience all classes on the same go.","March 3, 2014","true","93.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Rich lore, interesting storyline, various unique creatures and weapons. There are 3 main playstyles that vary considerably. If you want you can focus on one of the 3 or you can split it up between. There are so many possibilities, cool moves and useful spells. It has a solid blacksmithing and alchemy component to it, as well as something called sagecrafting where you can create gems that will power up your items.\n\nBecause most people are going to know what its like compared to Skyrim I guess I'll have to talk about that. In my opinion the combat is more rich. There's dodging, and blocking with sheilds is actually worth it and plays into your attacks if timed right. Also it feels way less hack and slash than Skyrim, there a different moves that when applied correctly can turn the tide of what might have seemed an unwinnable fight. The game auto-aims for you, but that doesn't detract from the fighting experience at all. The spells are also more interesting than Skyrim's. Skyrim might have more spells but they end up all feeling the same while KoA:R's are all unique and have very powerful uses in certain situations.\n\nKingdoms has an amazing world to explore. It is a bit small compared to Skyrim and doesn't allow for as much freedom (for example you can only jump down from cliffs and walls at certain points on the map) but it is something you get used to and it helps with where the game really excels: combat, because you are channelled towards groups of enemies.\n\nThe graphics are fairly decent and the game runs smoothly. I did run into a bug where you get stuck and cannot move at all and have to fast travel to get out of the place and the general pop in distance for enemies could be a bit longer, perhaps there is a way to change this in the .ini files or something, I'll have to check. The lipsyncing of characters is sometimes off and occassionally they make really awkward movements when speaking, which are a bit immersion breaking. The voice acting is quite good though like all RPGs I really wish they could have used a greater variety of voice actors.\n\nOverall its a great experience and I'm quite addicted to it so far. There are so many choices and I feel as if I will do a bunch of playthroughs with vastly differing character builds to get the whole experience. Oh that brings me to one last thing. You can "unbind your fate" for a relatively cheap gold cost to reset your points. This means if partway through a playthrough you got sick of smashing people with giant swords you could pay a bit of gold and change your character into a stealthy assassin or a flashy mage.","February 10, 2015","true","79.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sidequests are written brilliantly while the main story is rather dry. The combat isn't bad, but it's not good. It was never balanced properly.

It has a fluid and fun combat system. It has a generic but decent storyline. But best of all, it has good side quests. Some of them are even more interesting then the main storyline at times.\n\nWhat I liked most about Kingdoms of Amalur, personally... was how you could build your character in whatever way you wanted. You were not tied down to any restricted class. But you could cross-class between three different trees. Don't like what you ended up doing? No problem. You can re-spec your character at any time during the game. Gold is no object, as there seems to be an over abundance of it in the game. I finished the game with over 6 million pieces of dosh. If that gives you any idea how much money you can make in this.\n\nThe story goes like this. Your character gets killed doing something he or she shouldn't have been. You come back to life by some mysterious means... and you have the ability to control fate. Now it's time for you to go off and save the world. So yeah that's cool and all. We've heard this kind of plot before. But what is best about the game is the journey through it and the quests you undertake throughout. This game has good beefy side quests with rich story and characters. You wont be wasting your time like with a certain other game that just recently came out.. something with Dragons. Dragon Day I think it was called. Anyway, you'll find that there is a ton to do in this game. If you're a nut about completion this'll take you a good 100 + hours to complete. SO clear you calender, ya dig?\n\nWeapons are cool. Each weapon has its own unique style and use. I suggest dicking around with all of them and seeing what you like best. I personally enjoyed the chakrams cause you don't see them much in games, and the daggers because they're the only weapons you can do killmoves with on a sneak attack.\n\nThe game has a big flaw however and this is one I don't usually complain about with games.. but it was too easy. At level 20... 40 being the max.. I was nigh invincible. It's too easy! I played on normal difficulty, so I recommend maybe playing on Hard if you're not new to RPG's and third person action games in general.\n\nThe DLCs were both great. Teeth of Narnia & Dead Kenan & Kel had a great storyline and plenty of extra and new content. I'd totally recommend picking up the complete package when it's on sale!\n\nSo am I missing something? Probably. If you have any questions regarding the game, let me know and i'll answer them post haste.\n\nFinale Verdict: (4.4 out of 5)","May 7, 2015","true","130.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In comparison to KoA, Skyrim is similar, but a little less immersive.\n\nThe world of KoA is beautiful. The lore and the main story are well-written, and make the playing even more enjoyable. And the combat is fluid, and fun.\n\nLet's judge.\n\n(COMBAT)\n\nThe primary and secondary weapon system makes it so much easier to transition from a long-range to close-range weapon, or a slow weapon to a fast, or any sort of pairing one can think of. The different types of weapon (Chakrams, Greatsword, Hammer, Longsword, Daggers, Staves, Scepters, Faeblades, and Bows) provide much entertainment in battle.\n\nNo complexity nonsense with the controls. Movements are fluid and there are only 2 buttons. Mashing doesn't always work-- dodging is a necessity, making it less lifeless and more active. I suppose it is a little repetitive, but I find it fun, personally. (I might be wrong.)\n\nAlso, the whole "you choose your own fate" idea makes it easy to go down whatever path you want to, whether it be finesse, sorcery, or might. You can even have hybrid combinations.\n\nCool note: your dodge, if you take the finesse/sorcery route, can be replaced by a short-range teleport, which can later deal poison damage if you teleport through enemies.\n\n(LORE)\n\nYou have what I call "lorestones" scattered all over the world. The loading screens give you tidbits, and the cutscenes are, if nothing else, pretty. Dialogue with NPCs allow you to delve deeper into the story if you want to.\n\nI love the whole fantasy-world-in-danger spin.\n\nAlso, you are "fateless".  You're bound by nothing at all. And you have an uber-super-cool special kill mode.\n\n(GRAPHICS)\n\nI love games with beautiful graphics. Some pixelated games, too, work well, but KoA is far from pixelated. The faces are smooth, the armor and weapons are pretty, and the world is vivid. Walking through the forests or the swamps or the cities is an immersive experience in itself.\n\n(CRAFTING SYSTEM)\n\nYou can salvage items you don't feel like selling for components, which can then be used to forge the weapon of your dreams. Weapon customization at its finest. You can use gems as supplements, and (this is a small thing, but it's great) you can name your carefully crafted weapon, or armor. Name your longsword "Bootybuster" or something. Not that I would.\n\n(THE FINAL VERDICT)\n\nYo, buy this. I was looking for a good RPG for a long while. I bought this along with The Last Remnant (which I also HIGHLY recommend) and found that I loved it.\n\n10/10 <3","April 30, 2015","true","31.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Honestly, I was expecting it to be one of those games I play for a couple of days and then lose interest in.  I was very wrong on that account.  This is actually one of the best, if not the best, RPGs that I have ever played.  There were a few cons of course, but I will get to that in a little bit.\n\nBecause The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was the last RPG I played before this game, I could not help but to make comparisons during my entire time playing this.  In terms of graphics, I found Amalur to be far superior than Oblivion.  When you are walking in caves and you see all of the flora just come to life as you walk past, it is just captivating.\n\nIn terms of story line, I would say that they are about equal, but then again, I have not gotten all that far in Oblivion's storyline (I spend most of my time doing the side quests, build my character up some for the really tough bosses).  If I compared Amalur to Morrowind however, I would pick Amalur's storyline anytime.  Because unlike Morrowind, in which the storyline has you do all of these tasks to the point that it feels crazy, Amalur is fairly straightforward.\n\nVoice-acting, I don't really care for.  But from what I can tell, the voice of the characters in Amalur tends to have this almost...ghostly quality?  Almost like you are hearing someone in another room rather than them talking right next to you.  I guess you will either love it or hate, but for me?  I was indifferent.\n\nThere are plenty of side quests to take part in, just like in Oblivion.  Like Oblivion, you can take part in faction quests.  Like if you want to be the head of a Mage's guild in Oblivion, then you can do the same for Amalur.  However, while it it can take a few days or so to finish a faction quest in Oblivion, you can knock them out in Amalur in like, a day because the quests are so much easier and there are fewer actual quests to complete for the faction.\n\nThere is a huge variety of character customization.  Do you want to play a male or female character?  Go ahead.  Do you want to play as an Elf or a Human?  Go ahead.  If memory serves me right, then I think there are four races to select in Amalur, but the building of the skill-set does not occur until you actually start game play.  Like you do not decide immediately if you want to make your character a mage.  You can decide where you want to place your character's skill alignment later on and even then, you are fully able to go back and change your character's style whenever you want.  If you decide you want a hammer wielding mage, but decide later that you want to have a magic wielding thief or warrior, then you can do that.\n\nI guess now I can get into the overall pro's and con's.\n\nPro's\n\n-Absolutely amazing graphics\n- Wide skill-set available\n-You can change your skill-set whenever you want with no consequences other than what your character can or cannot wear or what they can do in combat.\n-Game play tends to be fluid and smooth, particularly with the combat.  You can dodge-roll or teleport out of the way of an attack and the game is not in first-person so you can see more.   I will get to con's later\n-Once the main storyline is complete, you can still continue on side-quests\n-Items will not weigh more than others.  While some weapons will impact attack speed, they will still only occupy one item slot in your backpack.  For example, your hammer, while slower in combat than your daggers, will still occupy the same space in your backpack as the daggers.\n-There is a hide-helmet option so that even if your character wears a hood or helmet, you will not see it in game play yet you will still have the effects.  I personally loved this feature.\n-Easier than Oblivion, but the boss fights can still crush you if you are not ready\n-Good enough that it deserves a sequel\n-My overall verdict?  I enjoy this game way more than Oblivion.\n\nCon's\n\n-Camera angles tend to lag every once in a while, to the point where you might have difficulty seeing an enemy\n-Character may freeze while running.  As in your character will just stop moving while running.  This can be overcome by rolling or teleporting, but it can be troublesome to freeze in the middle of a fight.  Also, this freezing will occur A LOT, and as such you will be rolling or teleporting almost all the time.  It took a couple of days for this to occur to me though.\n-Voice-acting is so-so.\n-From what I have heard, you can only reach level 41.  That is it.  But you can still reset your skill points later on.  Keep in mind though that this means you will not be able to completely max out all skills and abilities.\n-I have had difficulty completing a side-quest because every time I try, the game shuts down.  I do need to give it another try though.\n-Last I checked, the company that developed this game went bankrupt.  So do not expect a sequel or any patches.\n\nOverall, I say check this out.  I got it for $9.99 and this game was most definitely worth the price.  It is fun, beautiful, and the ability to change your skill-set helps to take away the pressure of having to stick with one field.\n","December 21, 2014","true","105.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game really does appeal to almost every sense of a great fantasy game: combat, exploration, interaction, etc. The camera could be a bit tricky as it did tend to fling around easily, but later in my playing I found that to be beneficial and detrimental to me in combat as pushing a key in the direction you want to attack and not the way the camera faced could be confusing at times, but I adapted.\n\nThe greatsword is by far the most fun weapon to play with in my opinion. I love games where they truly allow a greatsword to shine- where, when the blade hits something, it hits something. Striking multiple enemies and moving between them all in between swings feels extremely satisfying and really does give you a feel for that fanstical combat with monsters. The animations for many of the weapons are strong indeed, the only weapon I truly disliked were the hammers. Slow, clunky and short range. Staves, chakrams, and faeblades all look and feel very cool to use. Attacking and switching between weapons cancelled combo's and would allow you to be much more variable in combat.\n\nThe only things that I felt lacked were indepth, meaningful conversation with people, romance and how empty and underused many towns were. Now, no romance isn't necessarally a bad thing, but for rpg's it should be a given- everyone likes it and if you don't, well, you're wrong.\n\nMight is right.","January 17, 2015","true","33.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whilst the map feels vastly underpopulated and it is obvious from the design of the surroundings that this was intended to be a MMORPG, I think that adds a certain charm. Feeling tiny in a world so huge is part of the experience.\nIt did take me a while to get fully into the lore, and I wouldn't say I'm quite there yet, but you can certainly play the game without understanding the fuss about these 'Fae' or why everyone argues over this 'Mitharu' fellow.\nThe DLCs are absolutely fantastic and expand what is already a vast, multi-faceted world. The creativity behind this game is evident in every last corner.\nThough the character customisation is limited, that is probably a good thing, as I like to spend hours upon hours getting my hero's eyebrows JUST RIGHT.\nIt's also worth mentioning that the customisation extends into gameplay; the class system is, in my opinion, without fault.

It feels smooth and you can feel the impact of your blows on the enemies;moreover, its also quite forgiving  and only really ges hard if you rush ahead of the areas.\n\nThe games level system is based on a 3 section upgrade system focusing on\nMIGHT(melee)\nFINNESE(ranged and stealth)\nSORCERY(magic)\n\nThese skill tress can be mixed in any combination you like which can lead to intresting combinations of abilities and strategies.\n\nIt also looks pretty good if you into pretty things but the ccamera angle does not do justice to how beatiful and expansive the game is.\n\nOn the content side of things they is a massive amount of stuff to do in the game and you could sink hundreds of hours into this(I also played this game for like 200 hours on XBOX).\n\nOverall would cautiosly reccomend at full price and whole-heartadly reccomend on sale!","January 7, 2015","true","32.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Slowing down my step, I found out that the style of view is also amazing in another way and the moves of characters are quite smooth.\n\nThe open world and wide range of items must be along with a well RPG game, and Amalur does not lack anyone of them. It combines many good settings of lots of games. It has its flaws for sure, and I'll definitely choose Skyrim when these two games are at the same price.

Why not a must buy? It is a game and apparently a game franchise with no future. It plays far better with a controller than it does with a mouse and keyboard.\n\nWhat about the good stuff?\n\nIf you don't like crafting, you need not engage in it; but, if you are into crafting, there are opportunities to build some crazy good gear. Potions are kind of hit and miss, but you won't regret being able to make health regeneration and healing potions. Overall, crafted gear is not as critical as it can be Skyrim; and potions are definitely more useful.\n\nI really liked the combat system with its combos and different types of attacks working better/worse for different foes. There are opportunities to crank up the difficulty and win by thinking your way to victory. Alternately, you can reduce difficulty and just button mash your way through . . . should you fear the joystick and the nuances to combat. Each of the three major types of character archetypes yields a different playing experience.\n\nThe story and RP aspects of the game? Given the pedigree of those involved, this was actually little disappointing. The story arc isn't bad, but it is not as rewarding as, say, Dragon Age:  Origins or the first installment of Mass Effect.  The DLC is actually pretty good if you can forgive the grindiness of Naros and the silly in Dead Kel (some will find the silly endearing . . . others not so much). Some of the faction quest lines are actually good to very good; but the relationships you build with the factions comes to crashing end when the faction quests end. At the very least, this is a missed opportunity.\n\nI have no regrets buying this game when it was on sale.","March 22, 2014","true","286.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art style reminds me of an older style kind of xbox original game, which isn't a bad thing really.  There are plenty of in depth quests to do and a lot of replayability without being bored out of your mind.  Now my favorite thing so far, actually, is the weapons.  This game posseses a unique array of fantastic weapons such as Chakrams and Faeblades, and there isn't one that comes out on top for performance, so you can use what you like without drawback, all weapons are just different styles of combat.  The second most favorite thing about combat for me is the fateshift.  When you build up enough in your fate meter to use a fateshift, you go into Reckoning mode and just own everything, ending it all with a finishing move that looks super badass.

Dialog like Mass Effect, Questing like an MMO, Story like Guild Wars 2,Exploration like Skyrim and combat like Vindictus ( There is probably a better example of this one ). There really isn't anything origional in there, but that is not a con. This game combined the elements of all these other games together into a very enjoyable experience.

Hurts immersion\n\nDungeons feel exactly like skyrim dungeons with the expection of one key feature. Many small dungeons don't have a shortcut back to the start like there is in skyrim requiring you to backtrack your way out. Larger ones do have this shortcut.\n\nKeyboard controls work but change combat vs a controler. With keyboard you have access to more spells but you have to swap between weapons while on a controler you have a button dedicated to each weapon allowing you flow them into eachother smoothly but skills are access through an awkward RT + ABXY combination and are limited to 4.\n\nGame feels made for consoles but the port works fine. Controles are simplifed with buttons having multiple uses and the character draw distance being tiny.\n\nGame is no longer being developed.\n------------------------------\nOverall it is a very enjoyable experiance just don't expect anything earthshattering.","September 15, 2014","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is 9/10 combat, but camera wasnt that great sometimes but not a huge deal.\nI hate, that this game doesnt have FOV slider and i couldnt almost play it at original setting so i downloaded 3rd party FOV program (found it in community guides) which made my time with this game much more enjoyable.\nAlso if you are fan of epic story and great storytelling you will be probably kinda dissapointing. Story isn´t awful, but nothing spectacular and storytelling in this game isn´t good enough to keep you invested in characters.\n\nAll things considered this game is worth trying if you are fan of action combat and want GOOD RPG (dont expect best RPG ever).\nPS : sorry for typos","June 29, 2015","true","24.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Why not a must buy? It is a game and apparently a game franchise with no future. It plays far better with a controller than it does with a mouse and keyboard.\n\nWhat about the good stuff?\n\nIf you don't like crafting, you need not engage in it; but, if you are into crafting, there are opportunities to build some crazy good gear. Potions are kind of hit and miss, but you won't regret being able to make health regeneration and healing potions. Overall, crafted gear is not as critical as it can be Skyrim; and potions are definitely more useful.\n\nI really liked the combat system with its combos and different types of attacks working better/worse for different foes. There are opportunities to crank up the difficulty and win by thinking your way to victory. Alternately, you can reduce difficulty and just button mash your way through . . . should you fear the joystick and the nuances to combat. Each of the three major types of character archetypes yields a different playing experience.\n\nThe story and RP aspects of the game? Given the pedigree of those involved, this was actually little disappointing. The story arc isn't bad, but it is not as rewarding as, say, Dragon Age:  Origins or the first installment of Mass Effect.  The DLC is actually pretty good if you can forgive the grindiness of Naros and the silly in Dead Kel (some will find the silly endearing . . . others not so much). Some of the faction quest lines are actually good to very good; but the relationships you build with the factions comes to crashing end when the faction quests end. At the very least, this is a missed opportunity.\n\nI have no regrets buying this game when it was on sale.","March 22, 2014","true","286.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Slowing down my step, I found out that the style of view is also amazing in another way and the moves of characters are quite smooth.\n\nThe open world and wide range of items must be along with a well RPG game, and Amalur does not lack anyone of them. It combines many good settings of lots of games. It has its flaws for sure, and I'll definitely choose Skyrim when these two games are at the same price.

Eventually it became too hard to do so. The world is interesting, but there is too much lore and not enough drama and characterization. The choice of graphical style was very poor and is a complete mismatch to the fairly serious tone. Combat system, skill trees and many other things work well enough, but all collapses in face of the difficulty, or lack of it. It is simply impossible to fail in Amalur, and extremely hard to fall in combat. Crafting is so overpowered that loot becomes inessential and it is easy to kill everything with single clicks. Amalur is not moddable either. There is a difficulty mod, but it actually requires CheatEngine to use!","July 22, 2013","false","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first few hours, this game is a blast to play, until you out level everything. Once you out-level everything this game gets way to easy on hard settings. Also after you out-level everything your gear is way better than anything you loot from enemies (not rewarding).\n\nSo, why do I recommend this game? Because if you get it on sale you'll atleast enjoy 30 or so hours of it until you out-level everything and it becomes boring. The combat, skill trees, and the weapons and armor are really freaking awesome. I really wished they released coding for modders, this could have been my best game in my collection if I could've fixed how fast you level. There is one older mod for it to fix experience and gold while leveling, but it looks shady and you have to run the program everytime you play.\n\nI'm not a dark souls fan, but also hate playing games were I one shot eveything. So I give this game a 5/10. I knocked off 5 points for bad acting and becoming strong than a God after 30 hours with no real incentive to contiue the 100+hour game.","April 4","true","36.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've always enjoyed fantasy RPGs, and this little know game is a solid 5 star gem of one. The game starts with you, the protagonist, waking up in the Well of Souls, a so far unnsuccesful experiment designed to resurrect the dead. Your resurrection has also imbued you with the unique trait that you are free from the concept of fate, to which previously every single person in the world had been. You and your knewfound gifts are then tasked to explore Amalur and take down the Tuatha, an army of evil immortals hell bent on the world domination and your personal demise. Some of the defining features of this game:\n\nCombat: Some of the best combat I've ever experienced in an RPG. Simple enough in concept, its all about timing your clicks and mastering weapon combinations while weaving in spells when necessary. But what makes it awesome is how insanely good it feels. Think Shadow of Mordor, but faster and more epic. Plus there are so many weapons with so many stats that it almost feels like the fantasy version of Borderlands 2.\n\nUpgrade sytem: Brilliant. Instead of forcing you decide to upgrade stats without having any clue what they do only to later have you regret your choices, KOA gives you three different upgrade trees: Might, Sorcery and Finesse. Unlike many RPGs, there is not an optimal way to spend skill points, rather upgrading is more about giving you flexibility in how you want to play. You can go full man mode hammer smashing tank with might, ultmate arcane master, become the deadliest assassin with finesse, or any combination of the three. Points in each tree unlock unique spells, weapon combos or perks that make levelling up fun and impactful. Best of all, at any point in the game you reset all your points and reallocate them however you choose (for some gold).\n\nStory and World Design: Beautiful and original, KOA with leave you breathless at some of the worlds you find yourself in. The map is nearly Skyrim level huge, but also very well varied. There are dark caves, snowy mountains, massive forests, brooding castles, wide plains and many more, all populated with unique monsters, races and quests. You will never feel like the game is too small The characters and voice acting are spot on, if you like immersive RPGs then this one takes the cake. The art design is much more fantastical than many traditional RPGs, but I personally enjoyed it. Oh, and while there is a reasonable amount of walking, there is also a lot to do and see along the way, so I personally didn't feel like I was playing Hiking Simulator/Skyrim.\n\nMain and side quests. With 60+ hours on this game as of this review, I have only just beaten the main quests, one faction quest (probably about a solid 10 hours itself) and a handful of side quests. This game has soooooo much to do that I'm not sure I'll ever get to it all. Oh, and I haven't even bought any of the DLC.\n\nThe only real flaw in this game is that it is pretty easy. Dying doesn't punish you at all if you save properly, and gold is so plentiful that after a point I never had less than 20 or so potions in my inventory, meaning as long as you restock enough you really shouldn't ever die. Even for your first time I would reccomend playing on hard difficulty.\n\nConclusion: A beautiful story, fun class/upgrade system and an immersive world collide to create this action RPG masterpiece. This was one of the few single player games that I found myself able to enjoy for hours upon nonstop hours. And for 20 bucks full price, I can't think of a better value on Steam right now.","April 2","true","68.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

DO yourself a favor, right now, if you haven't played this game yet and you like games like Dragon Age Origins, The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher and Fable, buy this game and see that it does something that most modern RPGs don't attempt...\n\nSome of my issues with other modern RPGs as of late are the "build your own class". I'm not a huge fan, because it ends up feeling bland to me. where as when you play a game like World of Warcraft, you pick a race that is so colorful and interesting, then you pick a class that adds another layer of flavor.\n\nWhat KoAR has done is incredible, it allows you to craft your own class without shedding that flavor by using a system called "Destinies". It's a sort of Tarot card system, that allows you to hand pick between 3 major class types, mixing as you like and then you pick a card or Destiny that encompases your choices and adds bonuses to your choice to incentivise your picking a card that aligns with the ability choices you have made.\n\nIt's the perfect remedy to bulding a class without throwing the baby out with the bathwater, or the classes out with the player's handbook...\n\nThe story goes a long way to explain the gameplay which many RPGs fail to do. It has a way to explain character death and resurrection which i find very interesting and until recently many games have not attempted to explain, like Pillars of Eternity.\n\nThe games armor and weapon models are some of the most fantastic I have EVER seen!!! Not to mention the character models/designs, designed by none other than Todd McFarlane, have like many other featrues in this game, gone the extra mile by creating extreme detail to the characters anatomy, animations and movements.\n\nThe combat is VERY fun and fast paced. As you build your character up, you gain more and more moves and combos that all intertwine on the fly beautifully!!! You feel a real sense of power when you dispatch your enemies because ultimately it was you who chose this path of raw power.\n\nThere are a few things some players take issue with in this game, but for me the quality of the game outshines any small issues I might have otherwise. I know some gamers have issues with the cameras FOV and height, and I agree it could be better, but it is no where near the problem that could reduce my fun and also combat, if you are adept at games like Fable, Skyrim, you should set the games difficulty to hard at the beginning of the game because if I remember correctly, you can't change the diffiiculty after you start a new game, which is the only other odd design decision.\n\nOtherwise, PLAY KINGDOMS OF AMALUR RECKONING!!!\nSuch a shame this company didn't sell the amount of games needed to keep this franchise going, with an MMO that was on the way, its an utter shame that this incredible fantasy world was created from top to bottom and no developer has come forward to save this IP!!!","March 31","true","149.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I played this game for over 100 hours on my xbox before I wiped it.\n[Slight Spoilers]\n\nPros:\n+This game lets you play whatever build you want to do.\n-> Do you want to be a Mage and surprise people by slamming them to the ground with a massive warhammer? Do you want to play a Rogue who uses Daggers for assassinations but can hold her own in normal combat by wielding a Longsword? Do you want to play a Warrior who's only goal is to destroy people in insane combos with a sword that's twice their size? If you answered yes to any of these, please keep reading.\n-> Each class has a set of weapons and armour associated with it, as well as abilities. A Rogue, for example, is built on skill points invested into Finesse and uses light/medium armour that gives bonus critical hit damage. Rogue weapons are the Bow, Daggers, and Faeblades. Their abilities are varied between sustaining mana to apply poison damage to all of their weapons to raining arrows from the sky.\n-> The Warrior class is built on skill points invested into Brutality and can use Longswords, Greatswords, and Hammers with the heaviest armour that improves damage resistence and blocking ability. Their abilities vary from an adrenaline surge to deal massive damage when close to death to lifting all surrounding enemies into the air and slamming them all down.\n-> The Mage class is built on skill points invested into Magic and can use Staves, Septres, and Chakrams with Robes for armour that help improve mana regeneration. Their abilities can vary from chaining lighting to summoning a meteor to crash down on enemies.\n\n+Gives the middle finger to restricted builds with the Destiny system.\n-> You are not set to one way of playing the game. Just purchase a reset from a Fateweaver and suddenly, you can rebuild your character in their entirety! Go from a Mage in robes with a Staff and Septre to a hybrid Warrior/Rogue who uses a Hammer and Faeblades!\n\n(Keep in mind that there are many abilities to each class and you can do more than one class, or even all of them at once if you wanted. When you level up, read up on everything in your abilities tab and decide how the game should work for you.)\n\n+Super satisfying stealth gameplay.\n-> Say you were spotted by a Jottun (a reverse Dwarf as I like to call them.) You can teleport through them, throw a smoke bomb down, jump on their back from stealth, and stab their neck to oblivion only to backflip off as you watch them bleed out. It's not just the massive enemies that are satisfying to stealth kill! You can sneak up on a Bandit and in quick succession you can trip them, making them land on their back only for your character to cover their mouth and stab their chest. The sneaking mechanic itself is a little bit wonky but oh my gosh it's still amazing to assassinate half of a Tuatha scout party and have the last few left ♥♥♥♥ talk you only to get torn to bits by open combat; speaking of which, my next point is close to this one.\n\n+Fluid combat system.\n-> My favourite build was on my character named "Lorabella." She was a Warrior/Rogue hybrid that used a Longsword and Daggers. In the span of a minute, she can roll behind an enemy in stealth, backstab them, and immediately turn to the other enemies that spotted her afterwards. From here she can toss a smoke bomb or use an invisibility potion to get more stealth kills, or she can hold a weapon's attack (you can only equip two weapons at a time) and use the charge ability to launch herself at the nearest enemy, starting an attack combo which kills them quickly. After that, she can block with her shield at the right moment to deflect an enemy's attack and turn it into a combo to kill them quickly. I could go on and on about how many different ways you can play the same game and still be satisfied, but I will spare you from that.\n\n+Fateshifting.\n-> In a tight spot? Too many enemies and you just want to go to the next area quickly? Want to get bonus XP for doing what you already do to kill enemies? Just do it™\n\n+Fast Travel!!!\n-> Seriously who doesn't like this feature?\n\nSome cons:\n\n-The game can feel very repetitive.\n-> Bandits, Fae, some Gnomes here and there, Jottun, Etten, Spiders, Kobolds, and so on. There's not much for diversity in enemies to face, some are just slightly different reskins of the base creature that does something different. See: Kobold Savages are Kobolds that throw their spears instead of try to poke you with them.\n-> A lot of the game's quests are a variation of "go here and kill these things for me" and while the combat system is very fun, there's only so much that can be done before it feels like a chore.\n\n-Short story.\n-> Excluding the time spent running to the new locations, the Faction quests as well as the main quests feel a little short compared to the size of the world given to the player.\n\n(Overall, I would say this game is absolutely worth buying. I haven't gotten to the DLCs yet though I do look forward to it! I hope this review helped!)\n\n-KEM","March 11","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have fun with it, but really only because it's somewhat mindless and doesn't take a lot of mental involvement. Wait for a sale though :o\n\nOh, and play on hard.

The game kind of feels like it's trying to be too much for too many people; the way instructions are worded makes one think this were an introductory RPG (as compared to much more detail-oriented games like Divinity).  This irked me, strangely.\n\nI still recommend the game.  It's not "bad" per se, but falls short on too many levels to keep it from holding more profound players.  It's a 60-hour hack'n'slash with some great role-playing bits (not in terms of the story, ironically, but in how you want to approach combat) that you might like in spite of the amount of running you do.

From beging to end i never felt that this game really deserved the bad rap that it got. However I do understand that this game has its issues and there are far more polished and more sophistcated RPG titles out there. But i blieve the late 38 studios did a great job with this title, with this being its first and now only ever game the company has produced i blieve it deserves the cult status it has slowly achieved. The story, the lore and the characters is were this game really shines, its ingossing and it makes you feel like you are a part of the world, and i am truely hoping that one day a studio, perhaps Obsedian, will save the franchise and make a much wanted sequal.\nNow, there are areas that may turn people away, the combat is invigorating at first but quickly becomes quite repedative, and many of the side quests feel like you are just visting the same dungeon and the doing the  same objective over and over again. Although if you just stick to the main quest, you shouldnt come across this problem. The crafting system is also very limited and is pretty forgettable with the game's competitors blowing it out of the park. But that said it isn't bad either. With the fast leveling up, it feels like the crafting becomes more of a novelty in the late game.\nSo in conclusion, 38 studios, now gone will not be forgotten with this hidden gem in Amalur. I blieve the narrative of the game alone is enough to warrent interest from a new studio to give this ip another chance. Over all a good game, with some sub par RPG elements but with an amazing story and lore.

It's the most fun I've had with a game in quite a while and highly recommend it.  I'm a fan of action RPG games like Diablo, Skyrim, etc. but not too much of a fan of Witcher (too many lengthy story pauses) and Dragon Age (clunky keyboard/mouse combat).\n\nThis game has a great story woven throughout, and the excellent keyboard/mouse controls coupled with so many places to explore really won me over.   The level designs are excellent and each region of the game world really feels unique.  I also loved the reckoning mode which slows everything down and allows you to perform special kills which were very satisfying.  The character voice narratives are excellently done too.  Quest markers were easy to follow, and didn't experience a single crash during my entire playthrough, unlike with the Gothic and Sacred games which disappointed me in this regard.\n\nIf I had to give "slight" complaints, I would say the overabundance of purple unique items.  Making it more rarer to obtain these unique items would have given a greater sense of excitement when finding one.  Also, you will want to increase the difficulty which is not a usual practice of mine as I typically play games on Casual or Don't Hurt Me mode.  The easiest difficult option in this game is just way to easy.\n\nOverall, an outstanding game for those PC gamers who want a great exploratory experience and fun combat to boot.  I work for a living and don't want to be overly challenged when I find some time to game, and this game really hit the mark.  I give this game a 10 out of 10.","January 20","true","120.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(According to RPS commenters, it had a crappy outsourced demo, was overpriced, came out same time as skyrim.: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/02/26/why-didnt-everyone-play-kingdoms-of-amalur/#comments )\n\nAnyways, I absolutely loved this game.  While I only put 12 hours on my steam copy so far, I probably played ~100 on a different account, and it was some of the most enjoyable gaming I've ever done.\n\nMaybe I'm just weird but I love single-player games, and don't really touch multiplayer - I put hundreds of hours into Diablo 1-2-3 offline.  I hear there are a lot of bugs, but I don't remember any.  It was polished, smooth, visually gorgeous and vibrant, and addictive as hell.\n\nCombat was just badass.  Seriously, I just saw some of the screenshots on the steam page, and I forgot how amazingly fun combat was, especially with the more unusual weapons like chakras.  This game had one of the most satisfying combat systems I've ever seen.\n\nLooks like it's no longer expensive, it's easily worth anything under $20 if you enjoy ARPGs at all, I liken it to Diablo/Torchlight mixed with something like Devil May Cry or fast-paced fluid combat systems.  It's no Elder Scrolls game, but if you play it casually and just expect to grind through a bunch of enemies surrounded by lovely scenery and have fun for a while, it's totally worth it.","December 26, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It prides itself for having a wide selection of combat and adventuring styles, from a measly peasant to a brutal war-mage. You'll find loot for days and a fighting system that delivers satisfying crunches with every impact. I picked up six different builds before I settled on one that fit a medium-range capacity with all the abilities to deal with enemies of every calibre. The game punishes as much as it rains down riches upon you, the player. Keep your eyes peeled and your hands on your keyboard or controller, 'cause there's plenty of things to do from killing to talking to throwing out junk to getting blown up by that one annoying trap to crafting MORE gems to discovering an ancient ruin of a city to getting rejected by that one hottie of an elf. Don't ever trust the game to hold your hand; take what you get and give nothing back.\n\nCopious praise aside, there were a few factors which tripped over and otherwise pleasant gameplay experience.\n\nThere were bugs galore, from broken quests to broken npcs to missing items to items stuck in your inventory. A few of the colour palettes used were neon-nized to the point of frying the rods and cones in your eyeballs. There was so much story in the form of books that if you were to read all that AND read the npc dialogue AND run around looking for treasure, you'd be in the space age before you finished. The skill slotting menu and subsequent settings metres were broken in that they wouldn't move when dragged. Lastly, THERE WERE ONLY 2 DLCS ;_______________;\n\nI first got this game when I saw Youtuber @SSoHpkc playing it and it looked fun as hell\n\nIt really was fun as hell.\n\nBUY IT","January 16","true","113.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It probably will play on Intel laptops with at least an Intel HD 2500 gpu, that's impressive.\n\nThe combat is a lot like Darksiders or The Witcher 1.  Basically, you fight in a chain of attacks, usually moving in with each step in the chain.   There are abilities attached to each type of weapon.  You can fight with Daggers, Fae Daggers, Longsword, Chakram, Great Sword, Staff, Sceptre, Bow.   Each of these has a specialty tree where you learn additional passive and active abilities.   The active abilities have certain effects with certain special maneuvers learned.  So a Chakram attack can be held down with left click to create a large defensive spin area attack that applies the magic effect of the Chakram (burning, shock, etc) on everyone in the spin area.   It's quite simple to do and understand.\n\nOne of the beauties of this game is that every maneuver or ability you learn has a short movie in-game to examine, even before you learn it.  This gives you a good sense of the timing to achieve it and how it works.   A visual approach is used in almost everything.\n\nAnd the visuals are impressive.  You have a long view  of the terrain before any level of details lower and if cautious can often see your unaware enemy before you must engage, allowing you to avoid many engagements.  (There are ambushes though, and some enemies are much more alert, so there is still inevitable excitement in any journey.)  The style is exactly as in the pictures and movies on the Store Page.   You can customize your character a fair amount, nose, eyes, gauntness, coloration, hair almost as much as in Skyrim.   The graphics are in the vein of Warcraft but higher resolution and more detailed.   The scenery is colorful.   The animations are very good, both in combat and not.\n\nThe Lore is at least as good as Skyrim.  But to be honest, Bethesda lore is always contradictory and confusing, books often are wrong or disagree with the game.  Amalur has lore also, it is less contradictory and confusing, but it is likewise not consistent with the actual game.  I don't think one should really depend on such Lore as meaningful in either set of games.  The difference is that here, the books tend to agree with the reality in the game.  In Skyrim or Oblivion, or even Morrowind, the Lore does not agree with all that is in the game.  About a third of it is totally wrong, and another third of it is inconsistent or just filler.   You'll find less of those inconsistencies in Amalur, but some exists and some is filler.\n\nCombat is fluid, once learned it is easier than in Bethesda games.   Weapons apply much of the magic damage by the abilities and special moves, so there is a lot of value to loot and to armor.   Loot is easy to come by, one does not need to get the special help loot in one of the DLCs to do well, but the package deal is a good price.   I still have not even opened the DLC loot chest.   The most difficult level is level one, not because the in-game tutorial is hard, it is not, but because at each level you seem to grow stronger faster than the opposition.   Also, because it seems that the game's local monsters do not get stronger as you level, although that's a bit debateable.  They are at least capped in certain regions is my guess.\n\nThis means that although you are free to go almost anywhere, which is something sandbox RPG players like, you will find it tougher in the expected areas farther from your beginning and closer to the War's front.   You therefore get a sense of improving power as you level, as well as more flexibility in your skills.\n\nI find the game fair at all difficulty levels, play as you wish, difficulty levels can be changed on the fly, so the game is very user friendly.\n\nThe dialog is spoken, and although there may not be quite as much dialog as in Skyrim or Oblivion, it's close to as much, well voiced, and more to the point.   I believe this is an area where the game shines.  Quests seem to make sense, even the side quests have value and of course they make you see all parts of the world while being done.  There are a ton of quests and all dialog whether in a quest or not is well done and germane to either the quest or adding flavor to the game world.\n\nThe music, the art, the graphics, the animation, the color palette, the characters, the combat, the quests, the open world, the gameplay, the voicework  -- all combine to give you a full, consistent, enjoyable experience.   It combines the feeling of a personal MMO done right with that of an RPG adventure done right, with good action, lots of story, player progression that matters, and so many ways to achieve things and interact with a world you will care about.\n\nThere is little to fault here.   Are you afraid of having too little money ... there are crates that spawn everywhere, they aren't chests but remind one of the common loot crates on the Docks of Oblivion's ports.  Break them and you will get some coins over time.  So money is not an issue, although this is not the best way to make money.   Common enemies will respawn in the wild, perhaps even invading a town from time to time.   The guards will respond, but they can take their time, if you kill these interlopers you get a chance for more loot.  Things like this calm you in feeling you can make progress if you fall behind and that there is safety in familiar places you befriend.   Yet, there are ambushes regularly triggered, making good sense in the game, causing either rebel thiefs or beasts to challenge you in various locations as you simply travel about.  This adds to immersion.  There are many special hidden chests, some not so hidden that you can't find them if you look in every tree trunk or every path off the main beat.   But also there are some skills you can acquire to make your mini-map and map help you find more seriously hidden items that you might not find at all otherwise, even secret doors or secreted areas.  Every skill tree has value and you are not limited to any one class or tree or weapon specialization.  Whether you wish to be a better merchant or find hidden areas as a Thief, or cast many spells as a Mage, or fight as a skilled Warrior, you can always mix and match as well. Reset your skills for a price in gold, re-imagining your character.  If you like, craft potions, enhance weapons, salvage anything.\n\nThis is a great game, frequently 75% off, so you will not be disappointed.   I can't speak to whether or not the game is too hard or too easy, I would say it after some adjustment is probably easier than the Elder Scrolls series, but that doesn't make the journey any less enjoyable.   So if you want to travel in a beautiful story world with lots to do, in a more colorful and cartoony world that still has all the detail in graphics and story that you ache for, this is a game to recommend highly to you.\n\nEnjoy.  It is often on sale at 75 % off.   Buy it then.  The complete pack is usually $10 and the main game alone is $5.  It's a shame, these developers deserved a chance to make many more games, they would have been equal to the best.   This game has so many extra features done flawlessly, like the map and the movie clips for skill moves, that one has to wonder how this company ever went broke.   A great shame.\n\nNOTE:  This game does seem to require an EA account, but it's easy to register and works flawlessly otherwise.   For me it checks in via internet with the EA servers for authentication every time it starts up.  It may be possible to play the game without this internet access, but I mention this as information.","December 28, 2014","true","28.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

After booting the game and playing the first extended mission, you will quickly realized that a lot of love went into this game. There's not many games out there that feel like the people who made them were making a game that they simply adored and would want to play themselves. However, this is, without a doubt, one of those rare games.\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at some bullet points straight from the Steam store page:\n\n- Uncover the secrets of Amalur in hundreds of hours of immersive gameplay, from the vibrant city of Rathir to the vast region of Dalentarth to the grim dungeons of the Brigand Hall Caverns.\n\nThis bullet is not exaggerating with the "hundreds of hours" bit. I've easily sunk 63 hours (as of this posting) into the game and I have no idea if I'm close to the end. And you know what? I'm fine with that. The story is engaging and the world is full of awesome locations full of interesting people eager to send you even farther out into the world.\n\nOne of this game's most amazing strengths is that EVERY SINGLE QUEST has full voice acting. You never have to read a line of text if you don't want to. For me, this keeps the game interesting and pushes me to play farther into the story because I actually care about these characters. For once, the NPCs are not just cardboard cutouts with text attached to their face. It's incredible what a difference that makes.\n\n\n\nOkay so it has a ton of missions and voice acting, but does it have a world to support these characters and their stories? Hell yes it does! Take a look at this next point of interest:\n\n- Explore deep levels of lore in a universe steeped in 10,000 years of fiction created by New York Times bestselling author R.A. Salvatore.\n\nKingdoms Of Amalur has an Elder Scrolls level of world back story. Every book you find has a story written inside them about the towns, cities, people, and invading monsters. Exploration is rewarded with notes written by local townsfolk about their everyday lives, how they came to be, and their personal demons. Some merchants even keep inventory notes that you can peak at. You can spend hours just talking to individual people in the towns and learn how they feel about certain locations, the legends of old, and events that are likely to happen.\n\nIf you're one who craves lore, this game will not disappoint.\n\n\n\nLots of missions: Check. Lots of lore: Check. How about a good combat system: Double Check:\n\n- Customize your play in a dynamic combat system that delivers some of the most intense and responsive action ever seen in an RPG.\n- Seamlessly integrate magical and melee attacks as you take on scores of enemies in grand fight sequences and finish them off with brutal Fateshift kills.\n\nThe combat system is a hybrid of God Of War and the Fable series. You can move around feely, use two seperate weapons (of any type), and dispense of 4 different magic spells at anytime during battle. There's also a nice blocking mechanic that slows down time and knocks back any enemies around you to give you the upper hand.\n\nCombat has a very light locking mechanic as well. All the melee weapons have a 3 to 4 point combo that can be executed by pressing the button at a certain pace. Once you hit someone, the game will softly nudge you to keep you hitting the target. The reason I say "softly" is because you can change your direction at any point during an attack. See someone coming up from behind? Whip around and hit him with the final attack from your combo to make sure he doesn't get you with your back turned.\n\nSpells vary. There's a ton to choose from. Some are simple character effects, some are projectiles, while others are area of effect attacks. Each has a special visual style and devastating effects that can be upgraded through the abilities tree.\n\nThe "Fateshift" mentioned in the second bullet is a slow-motion mode that is activated once your Fate meter fills up from killing enemies. When Fateshift is activated, you are given increased damage output as you kill as many enemies as you can in the allotted time and then perform a special finisher move to the final enemy. Doing so gives you extra experience points!\n\n\n\nAlright, so there's one final piece I'd like to talk about, and that's the character building:\n\n- Build the character you've always wanted with the revolutionary new Destiny system that allows you to continuously evolve your character class to your style of play.\n- Create and modify your hero with millions of combinations of skills, abilities, weapons and pieces of armor.\n\nWhen it comes to character classes, there are three main choices: Might (Warrior), Finesse (Rogue), and Sorcery (Magic). You can either fully spec one of these classes, or go for something a bit more interesting and incoperate a little of each. Doing so actually effects some of the class bonuses (called Destinies) you get later in the game.\n\nAlso, if at any point during the game you get bored of your current class or you want to change your profession, visit a Fateweaver and simply respec every single skill and ability point you've earned so far for a small amount of coin. The game is long, and you'll like want to do this once or twice just to change things up and try something new. It's always nice when a game is flexible.\n\n\n\nThere you have it, my extended thoughts on Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning. Hopefully through this post I've helped alleviate any doubts you may have had about the game and pushed you towards trying a wonderfully crafted RPG full of exciting characters, locations, and monsters.

Although I have to mention it's still in a somewhat unfinished state, which is rather unfornunate :( because this game deserved more!\n\nLets get to the up and downsides of the game.\n\nUp:\n- A big, open world with plenty to explore and varriang landscapes (lush forests, dry deserts, damp swamps, etc.)\n- Really intuitive active combat it has some elements of darksiders and devil may cry (you can change between main and secondary weapons on the fly, use magic and can string together long combos *although therefore I recommend playing with a controller)\n- Quiet unique main story and setting (you are being killed and revived and therefore being able to change fate itself and later you also get information about your past before you were killed)\n- Crafting system (you can salvage any weapon/armor, except legendary and sets and get parts to craft your own weapon/armor and name it)\n- Dialogue system (sometimes you are able to persuade people, if your skill is high enough and therefore avoid some encounters)\n\nDown:\n- Tasks, secondary quest are pretty boring (many fetch and kill-x-of those quests)\n- Crafting system somewhat unbalanced (mid-to-late game if you craft your own equipment you will be pretty overpowered and will kill most enemys with one hit)\n- All in all a little bit to easy espacially some boss battles which therefore were pretty anticlimatic xD (minigames to pick locks is pretty easy even with few points in lockpicking *although the dispelling mini game can go eat it man, even with maximum level I still have problems but maybe it's because I suck at those things xD)\n- Graphics are average there are some good designed places, but other than that not really outstanding (and little variety in the faces, you will meet a lot of siblings but who knows maybe the genetic pool in Amalur is not really varied, that would explain the almost lack of facial animations espacially the main character which looks as emotional as a wet stone ;D )\n- Some bugs and exploits (due to the developer going out of business :( )\n- Best played with a controller\n\nAll in all it's a decent game, it's a real shame the developers went out of business before they could patch out all the bugs but you still get get enough entertainment if you go into it without expecting the next RPG-Hit.","June 20, 2014","true","110.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

A massive world full of people, factions, quests to do, places to explore and experiences to be had, it never received the due praise that it should have received.\n\nPossessing a truly original and authentic story and set in a vibrant world, I keep coming back to this game for more.  A non-linear leveling system that actually lets the player customize the game around their own playstyle, and a Fate system that allows for either further customization and giving the player a sence of accomplishment.  I wish more RPGs could be as well thought out and beautiful as this one.\n\nFor a single playthrough to experience a near full clear will take well over 100 hours, and that does not even touch the DLC.  At $40, this is an RPG YOU HAVE TO TRY.  The demo includes not only the starter "tutorial area", but after that you can take to the first zone for 45 minutes and do ANYTHING you want - quests, crafting, gathering, killing NPCs, whatever your heart desires.\n\nI cannot say enough great things about this game.

If you like a RPG game with a deep lore, love maximising your char (even overpowered maybe), then this is your game.\n\nPro:\n-This game rewards you if you tend to stay and upgrade a bit (sidequest, explore/exploit game mechanics) before going to the next area. Doing some research in the fighting mechanics will pay off, same for searching for clues how to maximise your char early on.\n-This game doesn't punish you for being intelligent and leaves the balance (and thus difficulty) in your hands.\n-Decent graphics.\n-Deep storyline. Troughout the world you get to know the lore even better with lorestones and sidequests.\n-Upgrade your char. A lot. With good (but not game changing) upgrades.\n-Change your character to another playstyle anytime you want. (This ability is very well integrated in the storyline: it is there for a reason. Thumbs up for the writers!)\n-Fast travel.\n-Many unique items. Item sets. All with unique abilities not found on equal 'normal' items.\n\nCon:\n-Content is repeated a lot. Especially the indoor environment build system is flawed.\n-Combat is a bit thin. Just get a big mana regen or health regen and change weapons often.

I am that bored...\n\nAlright then, Kingdoms of Amalur:Reckoning is an RPG single player only, while you play you will get the feeling that since the world is so expansive, filled with life and Npc's it should have had an online mode or it should have been a FREE Online game.\n\nTo Describe this game in few words they would be: Immersive World, Quests, Magic, Fate, Medieval Style, Monsters and Hitting deers into space.\n\nOk, with that being sed you can picture what the game is like!\n\nLet's start with the story, I was hyped about this game I remember seeing the trailers, how it had a guy who worked on the story of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, so the game showed great promise.\n\nThe game starts with the Story of the World, what's going on and HOW YOU DIED in the War the people of Amalur fought.\nYou wake up in a pile of decaying corpses and make your way up from underground to the Tower, you then realize that the tower is under attack by the Tuatha Dehon ( The bad guys) who are immortal.\nAs you go along you discover that you were revived by the well of souls and hence forth you are sent from quest to quest to find out what's going on.\n\nThe story telling in this game is average, the story itself is also average but the best by far in this game is the Combat System, fighting multiple units at once, with a fast paced system ranging from Bow, Hammer, Sword, Great Swords, Wands and the longer Wands XD. One of the best features in this game is The Fate power you get early on, which allows you to slow down Time and beat the crap out of your enemies and finish them off with an Epic and Awesome animations.\n\nSince you died and were revived, you can now change your fate and that of those around you. Example: By killing the Monster X they will not have the children X they were supposed to have. That enables to player to change the world around him.\n\nThe Side quests are repetitive and meh, The Devs sed that to complete the game fully it would take about 300 hours. I object to that! I am 50 something hours in and and I have done every boring and repetitive side quest there is to do, and I'm almost done with it. :)\n\nThere are also interesting and vast Faction Quest Lines with alternate endings but in the End they just get repetitive as the side quests do.\nI get the feeling that this game could have been more than what it was, too bad the company went broke from debt but there is still hope for the KOA Trade mark!!\n\nAlso a pretty huge part in this game is that, IT IS TOO EASY!! you'll realize this like 2-3 hours in, you destroy everything in your way pretty much without dying. I can even challenge myself into Not even dying once while playing through this entire game.\nThanks to the modding community there is a mod out there that makes the game harder to beat.\n\nYou can also craft armor, The skill system is quite vast, and there should have been Mounts in this game, I got tired of walking after a while.\n\nAnd there you have it, my review for Kingdoms of Amalur:Reckoning if you are a person that loves RPG like I do you'll get over the fact that it's single player online and immerse yourself in the mythos like I did.\n","July 9, 2014","true","74.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Some might describe it as a poor man's Dark souls mixed with MMO-like open world game where you do side-quests and events while following the main plot. And the world is big, some might even call it huge, with lots of towns, dungeons and forgotten ruins to visit, there is also lots of backstory to the world and you get a feeling of being in a magical world that is undergoing a conflit between various factions of fae, men and possibly gods. You can also just kill stuff and take their loot if exploring the world and its multitude of personal stories isnt your cup of tea.\n\nThat brings up the combat which makes up a big part of the gameplay (i suggest gamepad over m/kb) or at least so far about the only gameplay ive encountered as this game is really puzzle-lite. Not that its a bad thing as the combat is smooth and enjoyable. There have been couple of challenging fights so far, nothing impossibly frustrating, but most of the encounters resemble one-sided beatdown much more than an grueling conflict of two equally matched forces. Changing your build and gear does bring variation to the game and after trying both the mage and warrior builds i ended up with plate-wielding warrioress using spells to support her combat capabilities.\n\nEven with its faults and simplistic gameplay Kingdoms of Amalur is an enjoyable and fun experience for those times when you need to just sit back and relax. Get it but dont expect anything too deep or revolutionary from its gameplay even if its world had potential for future (shame the developer went bankrupt).","October 27, 2014","true","40.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its idyllic fields, rocky heights, and stinking caves are very pretty, in a cartoonish sort of way.  So are the expressive NPCs, viscious beasts and so forth.  Of course, no game has an infinite array of palates and textures, so those stinking caves get very familiar, very quickly.\n\nCompensation for "same-old-dungeon-itis" comes from the combat system.  As you level up, you gain new combos you can use in different situations.  Different weapons gain different powers, and you have the freedom to use your skill points to get more than one weapon to maximum level if you want.  Experiment with saving, then using your skill points so you can reload if you don't like what you find a skill doing.\n\nA sufficient number of upgradable magic powers and weapon skills keeps you moving from feral wolves to monolithic demons, with everything in between you'd expect from a fantasy game with any depth.  And this is one deep RPG.  Without trying, you're going to run into nine miles of lore.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050659872/recommended/102500/","76561198050659872","DedZedNub","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050659872/","261 products in account","Quick review after 40+ hours in the game (I play a lot offline, it doesn't count those usually).\n\nFirst, for those of you wondering, this game plays without a hitch on an i5-3450 with a mere Intel HD 2500 gpu, on Windows 7-64 bit with 16 GB RAM at 1360x768 with no framerate slowdowns.  It probably will play on Intel laptops with at least an Intel HD 2500 gpu, that's impressive.\n\nThe combat is a lot like Darksiders or The Witcher 1.  Basically, you fight in a chain of attacks, usually moving in with each step in the chain.   There are abilities attached to each type of weapon.  You can fight with Daggers, Fae Daggers, Longsword, Chakram, Great Sword, Staff, Sceptre, Bow.   Each of these has a specialty tree where you learn additional passive and active abilities.   The active abilities have certain effects with certain special maneuvers learned.  So a Chakram attack can be held down with left click to create a large defensive spin area attack that applies the magic effect of the Chakram (burning, shock, etc) on everyone in the spin area.   It's quite simple to do and understand.\n\nOne of the beauties of this game is that every maneuver or ability you learn has a short movie in-game to examine, even before you learn it.  This gives you a good sense of the timing to achieve it and how it works.   A visual approach is used in almost everything.\n\nAnd the visuals are impressive.  You have a long view  of the terrain before any level of details lower and if cautious can often see your unaware enemy before you must engage, allowing you to avoid many engagements.  (There are ambushes though, and some enemies are much more alert, so there is still inevitable excitement in any journey.)  The style is exactly as in the pictures and movies on the Store Page.   You can customize your character a fair amount, nose, eyes, gauntness, coloration, hair almost as much as in Skyrim.   The graphics are in the vein of Warcraft but higher resolution and more detailed.   The scenery is colorful.   The animations are very good, both in combat and not.\n\nThe Lore is at least as good as Skyrim.  But to be honest, Bethesda lore is always contradictory and confusing, books often are wrong or disagree with the game.  Amalur has lore also, it is less contradictory and confusing, but it is likewise not consistent with the actual game.  I don't think one should really depend on such Lore as meaningful in either set of games.  The difference is that here, the books tend to agree with the reality in the game.  In Skyrim or Oblivion, or even Morrowind, the Lore does not agree with all that is in the game.  About a third of it is totally wrong, and another third of it is inconsistent or just filler.   You'll find less of those inconsistencies in Amalur, but some exists and some is filler.\n\nCombat is fluid, once learned it is easier than in Bethesda games.   Weapons apply much of the magic damage by the abilities and special moves, so there is a lot of value to loot and to armor.   Loot is easy to come by, one does not need to get the special help loot in one of the DLCs to do well, but the package deal is a good price.   I still have not even opened the DLC loot chest.   The most difficult level is level one, not because the in-game tutorial is hard, it is not, but because at each level you seem to grow stronger faster than the opposition.   Also, because it seems that the game's local monsters do not get stronger as you level, although that's a bit debateable.  They are at least capped in certain regions is my guess.\n\nThis means that although you are free to go almost anywhere, which is something sandbox RPG players like, you will find it tougher in the expected areas farther from your beginning and closer to the War's front.   You therefore get a sense of improving power as you level, as well as more flexibility in your skills.\n\nI find the game fair at all difficulty levels, play as you wish, difficulty levels can be changed on the fly, so the game is very user friendly.\n\nThe dialog is spoken, and although there may not be quite as much dialog as in Skyrim or Oblivion, it's close to as much, well voiced, and more to the point.   I believe this is an area where the game shines.  Quests seem to make sense, even the side quests have value and of course they make you see all parts of the world while being done.  There are a ton of quests and all dialog whether in a quest or not is well done and germane to either the quest or adding flavor to the game world.\n\nThe music, the art, the graphics, the animation, the color palette, the characters, the combat, the quests, the open world, the gameplay, the voicework  -- all combine to give you a full, consistent, enjoyable experience.   It combines the feeling of a personal MMO done right with that of an RPG adventure done right, with good action, lots of story, player progression that matters, and so many ways to achieve things and interact with a world you will care about.\n\nThere is little to fault here.   Are you afraid of having too little money ... there are crates that spawn everywhere, they aren't chests but remind one of the common loot crates on the Docks of Oblivion's ports.  Break them and you will get some coins over time.  So money is not an issue, although this is not the best way to make money.   Common enemies will respawn in the wild, perhaps even invading a town from time to time.   The guards will respond, but they can take their time, if you kill these interlopers you get a chance for more loot.  Things like this calm you in feeling you can make progress if you fall behind and that there is safety in familiar places you befriend.   Yet, there are ambushes regularly triggered, making good sense in the game, causing either rebel thiefs or beasts to challenge you in various locations as you simply travel about.  This adds to immersion.  There are many special hidden chests, some not so hidden that you can't find them if you look in every tree trunk or every path off the main beat.   But also there are some skills you can acquire to make your mini-map and map help you find more seriously hidden items that you might not find at all otherwise, even secret doors or secreted areas.  Every skill tree has value and you are not limited to any one class or tree or weapon specialization.  Whether you wish to be a better merchant or find hidden areas as a Thief, or cast many spells as a Mage, or fight as a skilled Warrior, you can always mix and match as well. Reset your skills for a price in gold, re-imagining your character.  If you like, craft potions, enhance weapons, salvage anything.\n\nThis is a great game, frequently 75% off, so you will not be disappointed.   I can't speak to whether or not the game is too hard or too easy, I would say it after some adjustment is probably easier than the Elder Scrolls series, but that doesn't make the journey any less enjoyable.   So if you want to travel in a beautiful story world with lots to do, in a more colorful and cartoony world that still has all the detail in graphics and story that you ache for, this is a game to recommend highly to you.\n\nEnjoy.  It is often on sale at 75 % off.   Buy it then.  The complete pack is usually $10 and the main game alone is $5.  It's a shame, these developers deserved a chance to make many more games, they would have been equal to the best.   This game has so many extra features done flawlessly, like the map and the movie clips for skill moves, that one has to wonder how this company ever went broke.   A great shame.\n\nNOTE:  This game does seem to require an EA account, but it's easy to register and works flawlessly otherwise.   For me it checks in via internet with the EA servers for authentication every time it starts up.  It may be possible to play the game without this internet access, but I mention this as information.","December 28, 2014","true","28.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At other times, it is cliche and groan-inducing; just about anything having to do with the "Fate" concept in the game was at best predictable and at worst actually insulting in its lameness. The dialogue outside of story missions was also trite and felt written around a quest that had already been programmed into the game without a justification. This is extra egregious in a game that advertises how a famous fantasy author developed the story.\n\nIt has an art style that screams in vivid colors and exaggerated animations, which I personally love as a longtime ex-player of World of Warcraft. However, if you're a fan of dark and gritty, you won't really find it here.\n\nAnd honestly, most problematically, the game has a huge difficulty curve problem: it's way too easy. By halfway through the game, I had broken it even on "hard" difficulty. My warrior character, built in an extremely obvious fashion (and avoiding the bugged Last Stand talent), was nigh-invincible and two-shotting everything except bosses, and that's before stacking over 100% damage and several layers of mitigation in potions. The fundamental axis of interaction in KoA is combat; when it becomes so trivial as to be boring, the game falls apart unless you were happy playing on easy anyway.\n\nOverall, I really, really wish I could recommend KoA. . . but I think for most people that would read a Steam review, it's just not going to be the right choice.","September 12, 2014","false","33.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Fantastic time sink for anyone looking to lose hours of their day in a sytlistically dissimilar game.\n\nIt's a Hack&Slash RPG. This means that for those who like to fawn over the mechanics of combat in other RPGs, you may find some issues with this game. After a few hours, repitition does rear its' head if you only tend to play one type of the 3 main RPG classes (Spells and pointy hat, quick with a small stick and slow with a big stick).\n\nThat being said, the game rewards you immensely for spending skill points in all of the 3 main skill trees and usingthe varied types of weapons. Some of the attacks you can pull off with well timed spells after ranged/melee combos are simply outstanding.\n\nStory doesn't usually rank highly on my list of things I think NEED to be good for a game to be good but it certainly helps, especially in an RPG. The main quest in Reckoning will send you all over the place in stages, typical to any modern fantasy title. It takes you on a monumental adventure, eventually taking on an enemy no one had a damn clue existed and saving the day etc. good stuff all around.\n\nIt's in my personal opinion that ending was a bit weak and that it lets down the story as a whole. Rather than bundle up everything, it sort of hangs loose. This may have been due to a desire to create a sequel.\n\nNitpicking for those super into game mechanics i.e. CONS GO HERE\nThe world itself looks outstanding, however the only real issue I had with this entire game was the lack of ANY major verticality. The world is by no means planar, but the only transition between up, middle and down was if you interacted with the world to perform a jump into a roll landing from up above OR the world slopes down/up to meet the next area.\nEven if the height difference is an inch, you can't simply step up to that height.\n\nWhile released in 2012, the game has aged fairly well. Would absolutely recommend if it comes up in your Summer Steam sale or a normal purchase if you're simply looking for a solid game.","August 3, 2015","true","62.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But, what I can say here, is that for years I've been looking for a game that's centered primarily, if not wholly, around Celtic mythology, rather than generic European medieval fantasy or feudal Asian mythology. This game delivered, moreso than I could have ever thought a game could. Why there haven't been more games featuring such strong Celtic themes is beyond me, but Kingdoms of Amalur: Recokoning showed that it can be done, and done very well. I was definitely impressed with the story of the game.\n\nAs far as gameplay, things were pretty good. Combat and controls felt better with a gamepad than mouse and keyboard, but that's never been a dealbreaker for me. I feel there could have been more done with combos and chaining attacks, because combat felt a little static after awhile, but it wasn't awful. Most quests(but not all; here's looking at you, Til's Collection) were interesting and often felt like an interesting task, rather than a chore to do for XP. The main quest line especially was fun, interesting, and kept me pulled in to the game. Factions you could join in the game I felt were pretty mediocre, and are your generic warriors, mages, and rogues factions. Their quests were fun, but I never really felt like my character truely belonged to the faction upon joining. The one major downside I felt in the game was gear drops. Almost always, what you can craft at each level was better than anything you could find, even rare named pieces or sets. As for the DLC, Teeth of Narros had a fun main story line, but for the most part it felt drawn out and monotonous. The side quests were pretty boring, and involved a lot of backtracking. Legend of Dead Kell was much better, and felt more involved.\n\nOne more note: This game is LONG. And I really mean long, especially if you are a completionist and want to do all of the side quests.","November 2, 2015","true","105.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The downfall of the game was that you pretty much max the power of your gear way before the ending of the game.  I probably wasted more time grinding for loot to deconstruct and re-forge because i kept wanting to find the best gear....but in the end it was still fun.  Most would probably complain that it was too easy but i found it refreshing to be able to move forward than to die and try again over and over.  I definately recommend to action rpg fans.

Which is a shame, because KoA is a decent game. Right away I'd like to point out, it's essentially Fable + MMO, all single player. Combat is generally quick and easy, quests are your standard fetch and kill fare, and the world is generic high fantasy. That said, it's also lovingly crafted and just flat out fun to play. Even on the hardest setting the game is easy, and as quick as I am to decry games being dumbed down, it can be incredibly satisfying at times to just tear through hordes of enemies. The skill system has some decent depth to it, as does the gear. The world is beautiful and the sound design is solid. The game can feel grindy, again, it's basically a single player MMO, but it's also fun if you're into that sort of thing. If nothing else, pick it up cheap for some awesome chakram action.","July 10, 2013","true","53.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

From start to finish the backgrounds are visually stunning and each different hub area really looks different and visually sets the tone of the game. The fighting is fluid and responsive, in which you really feel like you are a powerful warrior. The fighting animations look fantastic and vary well with different weapons. There is a lot of lore to discover, some of which is interesting. The questing can get a little laborious at times. The loot drops are not that great. I made a good pair of charkrams early on and never really found a better weapon. With that there is a pretty good crafting and gemcraft mechanic in the game that allows you to make comparable items to those drops found on mobs. By the end the story sort of fell off and seemed a little rushed. The side quests can be interesting at times and the NPC are for the most part interesting and engageing.

It isn't Skyrim, at all. A game it is much closer to is Fable. I liked Fable, it's not the most in depth RPG but its fun and the combat is nice. Now, back to Kingdoms. The story line is a typical RPG story, you are seemingly a nobody, but something “happens” and you are now the key to everything. I don't want to spoil the game as the story is nice, but its nothing fancy. Serviceable with a hint of charm is how I would describe it. If you do not like the story, the game is built so you can skip that on and get to the combat. The combat is similar to Fable in how it works, but its much more advanced. You have the typical class choices, a big warrior, stealthy dual blades, wizard. They do differ a lot, and how you build them is up to you, although it doesn't offer THAT much of a choice that you would consider it important for multiplay through other than each class on its own.\n\nThe inventory system is not great, but it works fine enough if it is a little cumbersome. Plenty of lot to play about with, and a lot of side quests and mini-stories that do a good job of introducing you to the other elements of the game. I would happily say this game is a good weekend game, you would be hard pressed to dislike it too much. It is not as free as Skyrim and I think some people looking for that type of RPG fix might get a little put off with this game, but if you have ever enjoyed Fable you would do well to give this a shot.\n\nPresentation is nice, it doesn't feel like a cheap game, it feels very well built and everything is built with a purpose. Its a genuinely nice game to play.","April 6, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is hard to pinpoint why it is so boring, it just is. Probably mainly because of the combat getting old fast.\nThe baseball player Curt Schilling who I saw play quite often when I was younger financed the company that made this game and this was the only game they made. They ended up going bankrupt and shutting down after not being able to pay back loans to the state of Rhode Island.\nGame has good graphics which along with combat are its high points. I would not exactly say the graphics are great because they are not, and are not bad either, just colorful and pretty. Weapons are cool and the spells/skills look great, however few skills there are, and enemies are varied and cool also. For sure worth a look if you want a decent RPG.

In general the user controls are good and feel intuitive, the quest tracker is undertsandable and guides you to the wanted place with high accuracy, for some this might not be the most wanted quality but for game as large as KoA:R quest tracker is mandatory. Combat systems are explained clearly and as games greatest asset, you can build your character pretty freely to suit your personal tastes.\n\nEven with the good and working character building, the game has some major flaws. The problems start at midgame and continue from there. The problem at least for me lies at both game content and at actual combat system. As for game content the problem is mainly about:\n\n- Mediocerly written plot and character interactions, you will not care about the dialogue after a while and certanly you will not be able to remember the names of the NPC:s in the game, at least I didn't.\n- Encounters are about all identical, you will not give much of a thought for the cave/mountain/primire troll which you encounter for the 50th time in single playthrough same with about every encounter in the game, after about level 7 you have necountered 90% of the games enemy types and rest of the game rotates those.\n\nFor comabt system the major problems are:\n\n- Severly broken combat, it is far too easy. You don't often get any feeling from the combat, as above you will be fighting the same troll with 80% same skills and animations.\n-Too effective potions: 1) potions take next to zero inventory space 2) at second highest ~level 28 the startter potion heals for 70% and you can spam them at insane ratio (one about per 5 seconds) 3) the aftermentoined potion at that any level after 5th has effective cost on null.\n-Unscaling abilities the abilites at start feel too broken but after level 20 you will do 10x the damage with your auto attack and all reasonalbe abilites seem passive or active percentual buffs to damage.\n-Too effective bloking with warrior destinies you at endgame became able to block anything in the game makeing the comabt bit cheesy since you just plot the block up and laugh since not even the troll is able to penetrate your defences.\n-----OBNOXIOUS COMABT: The comabt is sometimes a bloody chore, when you are fighting the same enemies with just 10 x the normal hp you get slightly agitated, and usually the dificulty come from annoyance and not from difficult fight, in the entire game i encountered a single fight which was actually hard.\n\n\nIn overall the game is fine purchace from sale. At full price it's slightly at the expencive if compring the complexity of the content to the price tag, but at decent sale, do buy the game. It has fluid mechaning built around staggering your enemies to death and it's fun and easy to get into. At the endgame developers could have made more unque content to make the game more enjoyable, but regardless it's not the worst purchese you could make.","July 5, 2015","true","50.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In fact, it's so big and deep that the game becomes overwhelming. It also gets repetitive very fast. Fighting enemies gets dull. You have a plethora of moves you can unlock as you level, but in the end, a short 3 hit combo, block hit and dodge are all you need to survive. Weapons like bows or two handed weapons become redundant once you can craft your own items with god tier gems. Daggers, with their speed are the only choice as all the enhancements are +X per hit, instead of scaled or % increases.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I LOVE this game and go back to it every so often. With an art design between Fable and WoW and a combat system reminiscent of Devil May Cry (minus the focus on strung out combos) it is incredibly fun for short bursts. The Combat is fun and takes a while to reach the repetitive droning that I stated earlier. There is a large variety of spells and skills, but weapons and armor are pretty much able to be maxed out just around halfway through the game.\n\nNote if you want a challenge, top tier regen gems and life/mana leech gems on weapons should be avoided. The only downside here is the lack of variety for enemies. Most enemies are beefed up/palette swapped versions of enemies you encounter early on.\n\nThe world is huge, and the lore is pretty deep if you take the time to find it all. The Lorestones are impressive in their stories, and the bonuses they provide are generally useful. But there are TONS of Lorestones. Trying to find them all is tedious even after getting the upgrade that reveals EVERYTHING on the map. Which leads me to the last point: the Jack of all trades approach is not only good, but generally preferred in this game. The rewards at high levels in this game (where your classes are determined by which one you want to be and qualify for) are far above the high level rewards for any other classes, IMO.\n\n\nThis game is a good play, but due to some repetitive (if fun) combat and quests, it only gets a solid 7 of 10 from me. You should play it, especially if it's cheap. But don't get obsessed with 100% completion.","April 18, 2014","true","42.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you're looking for blockbuster material, you won't find it here.\n\nThe story is excellent and the lore to back it up equally great. So if story driven stuff is what you're after, you should enjoy this. For me, it was the sole reason I went ahead with playing it to completion.\n\nThe main problem is the graphics and gameplay drag it down badly. I've been talking about it in passing as though it was a 2006 release because frankly it doesn't look as nice as Oblivion, then just noticed it has a 2012 date on it. OK.\n\nGameplay is very very MMO-ey, and as it turns out there's a reason for that. It was supposed to be one at one point but got downscaled into a single player game. So yo have lots and lots of combat action and loot grinding going on.\n\nThe two DLCs were actually much better than the main game too, though that could be because I'm partial to content that gives me castles and keeps to build and upgrade :P\n\nOver all, worth it when it's on sale.

Admittedly, when the opening sentence of a game's description name-drops RA Salvatore and Todd McFarlane as the creative minds behind it, I probably should have set my expectations a bit lower, but we were all young and foolish once, right? Overall, Kingdoms presents a game that's not entirely without it's good points, but those elements are buried underneath the larger, sweeping design decisions dragging this game down.\n\nAt it's core, the main problem is one of level design. While the game world is large, there's not really much there. The towns are small, sparsely populated, and serve as little more than housing for a population of layabouts looking for some adventurer to do their  pointless errands  quests. The countryside is big and empty except for the regular enemy spawn points and dungeons are much the same. Really, the entire game world seems designed much more for a MMO than it does for a single player game, where the gameplay is really meant to serve as a backdrop for player interaction and competition. As the player adventures out into the game's wilderness alone, however, it's vast emptiness of any meaningful content quickly becomes apparent.\n\nSimilarly, the writing, at best, is passable, but I never really get the sense that my character is anything more than a mass of stats and that the majority of the NPCs in the game are anything more than quest nodes with some dialogue attached. It doesn't help that nothing you do in the game seems to actually matter. Take the evil route in a quest and slaughter an entire village? Well... it gets you the assurance that... at some point in the future... the place will become really terrible, but there's never a noticeable change to the world or the way NPCs perceive you beyond that.\n\nWhile, as others have pointed out, the combat is well-designed, I can't really say that it's much of an upside in the game. The problem remains that, because of the lackluster level design, the combat never really gets the chance to shine like it could. Enemies spawn in random groups across the game's empty countryside and dungeons, leading to the player being confronted with a long stream of samey and increasingly tedious battles.\n\nKingdoms suffers from a design ethic of "bigness" and "more content." While the world is certainly big, this bigness seems only to weigh the game down. In the end, I couldn't help but wonder if Kingdoms would have benefitted from offering the player a smaller, more carefully designed experience.","February 2, 2014","false","77.5"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

It's just failing to hold you to play. It's okay in short bursts. It's a pretty nice action rpg, but killing thousands and thousands of same enemies (which can take a lot of time, esp near the end, because game just throwing dozens of tuatha elite troops, and trolls at you)\nCombat system has it's own flaws too. It becomes repetitive as heck after a while, because you usually stick to two weapons, which suits you (in my case - chakrams and greatsword). It's still entertaining to watch, but if there a lot of enemies there is a great chance that character will be stunlocked.\nQuests are pretty bore too. It's either fetch-quests or kill quests, with very very rare puzzles. And tasks - WoW dailies. Bring me ten bear legs to get a bag of gold. Rince and repeat.\nFactions - kinda good. Travelers and warsworn are pretty good, nothing original, but still pretty good. Backstabbing, heroic deeds all that kind of stuff.

It does have it's slow moments due to the fact it was built upon the remnants of the MMORPG the game was originally supposed to be so there are lots of mmo type quests and a vast world with about 30 or so areas.\n\nTalent trees while generic are well thought out. and are supplemented by gate cards which allow your character to specialize into a class based on how many points you have spent in each of the 3 trees. ( Might, Finess, Sorcery)\n\nThese cards even come fully stocked with hybrid classes for people like me who like to mix and match for interesting character set ups.  Each class can add some itneresting features as you slowly upgrade with more points.\n\nAn example would be once you have enough sorcery in the rpimary and hybrid sorc classes your dodge can become a short teleport instead of a roll.\n\n\nI highly recommend this game expecially if it is on sale.","December 6, 2015","true","18.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its colourful, with well scripted dialogue, some unique combinations of standard fantasy concepts without being too aggressively unique, and placed an interesting spin on the undying character (with an idea as interesting as Assassin's Creed's Animus). However it fails to maintain interest during the late game as quests and challenges become all too easy, leading up to a disappointing ending that would have been far more interesting if it had more impetus.\nBoss fights are also poorly executed with a variety of standard RPG tactics being utilised, and no unique inventive ways to challenge the enemies provided. Many of the Bosses attacks, have been done in previous games before, not a problem if you're new to the genre, I suppose, but problematic for 3rd person action RPG veterans.\nAmalur does provide an interesting levelling and skills tree progression, that allows for limited customisability, but does shine in its simplicity to understand, and ways to play around and discover effective combinations of skills from its three separate progressions.\nIt's most definitely a fun game to play and waste a few days on, but won't offer much depth either in combat or narrative, so will always be a rather dismal second to its far more developed and innovative competitors.","December 5, 2015","true","72.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have spent many hours just getting to lvl 20 and I feel like I have been through wave after wave of build up then grind. I love the look of it as well as the support characters (some of who make me want to slap the poo out of them, others make me want to take them behind closed doors...), I give this game a 9.5/10 It loses .5 points because the merchant buy/sell menu makes you wade through ALL of your gear to sell a few things that you dont want (Including the crafting gear which if you are a collecter can be MASSIVE).

In fact, it's so big and deep that the game becomes overwhelming. It also gets repetitive very fast. Fighting enemies gets dull. You have a plethora of moves you can unlock as you level, but in the end, a short 3 hit combo, block hit and dodge are all you need to survive. Weapons like bows or two handed weapons become redundant once you can craft your own items with god tier gems. Daggers, with their speed are the only choice as all the enhancements are +X per hit, instead of scaled or % increases.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I LOVE this game and go back to it every so often. With an art design between Fable and WoW and a combat system reminiscent of Devil May Cry (minus the focus on strung out combos) it is incredibly fun for short bursts. The Combat is fun and takes a while to reach the repetitive droning that I stated earlier. There is a large variety of spells and skills, but weapons and armor are pretty much able to be maxed out just around halfway through the game.\n\nNote if you want a challenge, top tier regen gems and life/mana leech gems on weapons should be avoided. The only downside here is the lack of variety for enemies. Most enemies are beefed up/palette swapped versions of enemies you encounter early on.\n\nThe world is huge, and the lore is pretty deep if you take the time to find it all. The Lorestones are impressive in their stories, and the bonuses they provide are generally useful. But there are TONS of Lorestones. Trying to find them all is tedious even after getting the upgrade that reveals EVERYTHING on the map. Which leads me to the last point: the Jack of all trades approach is not only good, but generally preferred in this game. The rewards at high levels in this game (where your classes are determined by which one you want to be and qualify for) are far above the high level rewards for any other classes, IMO.\n\n\nThis game is a good play, but due to some repetitive (if fun) combat and quests, it only gets a solid 7 of 10 from me. You should play it, especially if it's cheap. But don't get obsessed with 100% completion.","April 18, 2014","true","42.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So if story driven stuff is what you're after, you should enjoy this. For me, it was the sole reason I went ahead with playing it to completion.\n\nThe main problem is the graphics and gameplay drag it down badly. I've been talking about it in passing as though it was a 2006 release because frankly it doesn't look as nice as Oblivion, then just noticed it has a 2012 date on it. OK.\n\nGameplay is very very MMO-ey, and as it turns out there's a reason for that. It was supposed to be one at one point but got downscaled into a single player game. So yo have lots and lots of combat action and loot grinding going on.\n\nThe two DLCs were actually much better than the main game too, though that could be because I'm partial to content that gives me castles and keeps to build and upgrade :P\n\nOver all, worth it when it's on sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/recommended/102500/","ryanyth","Encephalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/","441 products in account","Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a 2012 single-player action role-playing video game developed by Big Huge Games and 38 Studios, and published by Electronic Arts.\n\nBefore this game was released, it was touted to be designed by a former Bethesda Game Studios veteran Ken Rolston who had worked on the award winning Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Famed fantasy author R.A Salvatore created the lore and backstory for the game's universe and the artwork was done by Todd McFarlane who is famous for his work on the Spawn comic series. 38 studios itself was owned by former baseball pitcher Curt Schilling, who was known to be a very avid video gamer himself.\n\nWith such big names behind this title, how is the actual game itself?\nSadly, it can all be summed up in one word: Average.\n\nGraphically, while the game was done by Todd McFarlane, it looked nothing like McFarlane's signature style of bold colours and harsh artistic lines. In fact, the whole game looks like a Fable clone artistically. While the locations can look quite nice at times, it gives an overall "Been There, Done That" feel. Especially for players who have played Fable.\n\nGameplay is also extremely linear. Every location in the game, every dungeon feels like a corridor. While the game gives you an illusion of an open-world, it never really is. You will be stopped by invisible walls, can only travel on certain allowed paths. Its so restrictive, that your character cannot even jump, and can only leap off ledges at certain designated points.\n\nIn every RPG, story is quite possibly the most important aspect, and surely a story by famed fantasy writer R.A Salvatore would be something special? Well...not really.\n\nWhile R.A Salvatore tries to craft a very intricate universe with lots of backstory, most of it can only be found in lorestones, books and you actually need to go out of the way to read them to understand the lore behind it. I don't know about you guys, but video games aren't novels. I'd rather EXPERIENCE a story thru gameplay myself rather then read one when i'm playing a video game. The over-arching main story quest is also quite generic, and is actually rather short with only 13 quests in total. None of the characters are particularly memorable and there aren't any plot twists.\n\nNow I wouldn't have minded if the main quests were full of depth but they simply are not. Most of them just directs you to go to a specific location, kill someone and rinse and repeat. If it isn't a search and destroy mission, NPCs will actually ask you to go to 3 completely different areas on the map to do basically the same thing before you trudge back to the NPC to continue with the story.\n\nConsidering there are no mounts in the game, you can understand how tedious it was to travel on foot to repeat the same thing 3 times. This is obviously used as a cheap way to artificially lengthen the gameplay time. Luckily there is a fast-travel option available, but you can only use it if you have been to the location before. I never once used fast-travel in an Elder Scrolls game, because each location in that title is unique with lots of explorable locations with interesting quests. With this game however, I was so bored of the generic story of the main quest and boring fetch quests type sub-quests that I fast travelled whenever I could.\n\nWith that said, the only saving grace of this title is the combat which is absolutely brilliant.\nCombat movement is extremely fluid combined with beautiful animations makes combat a joy to play. It doesn't matter if you choose to swing a sword, use a dagger or cast a spell. All of them have unique and cool animations and are a joy to play with. It almost felt as if they spent all their budget on perfecting the combat but neglecting everything else that makes a RPG special.\n\nThis game adds a unique "Reckoning" mode for combat which is a mode you can activate to go slow motion ala Matrix style after accumulating enough to fill a meter to dispatch multiple enemies with flourish that will net you extra experience points. The game will go into a QTE mode where mashing certain buttons can net you even more experience points. While its cool to go all Matrix style on enemies for the first few times, the novelty does wear out after your 50th "Reckoning" mode and it quickly becomes just another way to farm Experience Points.\n\nAs I come to the end of this review, I feel that you should know that this was the only game developed by 38 Studios before they filed for bankruptcy. 38 Studios is no more. This also means that the future of this IP is in doubt. The last I read back in 2013, there were no buyers interested in this IP Franchise when they were doing an auction to sell off their properties. Do not expect to see a sequel or anything Amalur related anytime soon. (If ever.)\n\nOverall Rating: 6.5 / 10\nAn Action-RPG with excellent combat mechanics but with little ambition. It doesn't try anything new and gives a very average overall feel to the whole thing. Worth a look though if its on a very deep discount.","November 8, 2015","true","21.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's just failing to hold you to play. It's okay in short bursts. It's a pretty nice action rpg, but killing thousands and thousands of same enemies (which can take a lot of time, esp near the end, because game just throwing dozens of tuatha elite troops, and trolls at you)\nCombat system has it's own flaws too. It becomes repetitive as heck after a while, because you usually stick to two weapons, which suits you (in my case - chakrams and greatsword). It's still entertaining to watch, but if there a lot of enemies there is a great chance that character will be stunlocked.\nQuests are pretty bore too. It's either fetch-quests or kill quests, with very very rare puzzles. And tasks - WoW dailies. Bring me ten bear legs to get a bag of gold. Rince and repeat.\nFactions - kinda good. Travelers and warsworn are pretty good, nothing original, but still pretty good. Backstabbing, heroic deeds all that kind of stuff. Kinda wish there were more epic fight and moments like in main story. Houses of ballads and sorrows, and mage's guild - good story, but notthing incredible. I even can't decide whether i want to be the bad guy or the good guy.\nOverall i would call this game average at most. Some good ideas, decent fighting system, tons of not so interesting content, but extremely repetitive.","February 15, 2014","false","51.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

It stays true to the core mechanics of RPG, and the combat-system! THE FrEaKiNg CoMbAt! It is, to date, the best, most fluid combat system I have ever seen. And Ive seen alot. Better than all other. Even Skyrim.\n\nPros:\nAwesome, HUUUGE gameworld\nFukking best combat ever!\nLots and lots of quest, over 200 hours content.\nAwesome-looking weapons and armor, as well as spells.\nBrutal and satisfying finishers!\n\nCons:\nNPC`s could use some work\nNot the best graphics\nREALLY linnear side-quests\nFeels like an MMO without other players than you\n\nOverall Rating:\n8.5/10\n\nI would DEFINENTLY recommend picking up Kingdoms Of Amalur. Its 19.90£ on steam, and thats alot of good stuff for the money. And the best part is you dont need a freaking chuck norris computer to run this game. I play this on a laptop, and I still get around 40 FPS! If you are a fan of RPGs, you will absolutely LOVE this!\n","August 19, 2014","true","4.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/recommended/102500/","ryanyth","Encephalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/","441 products in account","Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a 2012 single-player action role-playing video game developed by Big Huge Games and 38 Studios, and published by Electronic Arts.\n\nBefore this game was released, it was touted to be designed by a former Bethesda Game Studios veteran Ken Rolston who had worked on the award winning Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Famed fantasy author R.A Salvatore created the lore and backstory for the game's universe and the artwork was done by Todd McFarlane who is famous for his work on the Spawn comic series. 38 studios itself was owned by former baseball pitcher Curt Schilling, who was known to be a very avid video gamer himself.\n\nWith such big names behind this title, how is the actual game itself?\nSadly, it can all be summed up in one word: Average.\n\nGraphically, while the game was done by Todd McFarlane, it looked nothing like McFarlane's signature style of bold colours and harsh artistic lines. In fact, the whole game looks like a Fable clone artistically. While the locations can look quite nice at times, it gives an overall "Been There, Done That" feel. Especially for players who have played Fable.\n\nGameplay is also extremely linear. Every location in the game, every dungeon feels like a corridor. While the game gives you an illusion of an open-world, it never really is. You will be stopped by invisible walls, can only travel on certain allowed paths. Its so restrictive, that your character cannot even jump, and can only leap off ledges at certain designated points.\n\nIn every RPG, story is quite possibly the most important aspect, and surely a story by famed fantasy writer R.A Salvatore would be something special? Well...not really.\n\nWhile R.A Salvatore tries to craft a very intricate universe with lots of backstory, most of it can only be found in lorestones, books and you actually need to go out of the way to read them to understand the lore behind it. I don't know about you guys, but video games aren't novels. I'd rather EXPERIENCE a story thru gameplay myself rather then read one when i'm playing a video game. The over-arching main story quest is also quite generic, and is actually rather short with only 13 quests in total. None of the characters are particularly memorable and there aren't any plot twists.\n\nNow I wouldn't have minded if the main quests were full of depth but they simply are not. Most of them just directs you to go to a specific location, kill someone and rinse and repeat. If it isn't a search and destroy mission, NPCs will actually ask you to go to 3 completely different areas on the map to do basically the same thing before you trudge back to the NPC to continue with the story.\n\nConsidering there are no mounts in the game, you can understand how tedious it was to travel on foot to repeat the same thing 3 times. This is obviously used as a cheap way to artificially lengthen the gameplay time. Luckily there is a fast-travel option available, but you can only use it if you have been to the location before. I never once used fast-travel in an Elder Scrolls game, because each location in that title is unique with lots of explorable locations with interesting quests. With this game however, I was so bored of the generic story of the main quest and boring fetch quests type sub-quests that I fast travelled whenever I could.\n\nWith that said, the only saving grace of this title is the combat which is absolutely brilliant.\nCombat movement is extremely fluid combined with beautiful animations makes combat a joy to play. It doesn't matter if you choose to swing a sword, use a dagger or cast a spell. All of them have unique and cool animations and are a joy to play with. It almost felt as if they spent all their budget on perfecting the combat but neglecting everything else that makes a RPG special.\n\nThis game adds a unique "Reckoning" mode for combat which is a mode you can activate to go slow motion ala Matrix style after accumulating enough to fill a meter to dispatch multiple enemies with flourish that will net you extra experience points. The game will go into a QTE mode where mashing certain buttons can net you even more experience points. While its cool to go all Matrix style on enemies for the first few times, the novelty does wear out after your 50th "Reckoning" mode and it quickly becomes just another way to farm Experience Points.\n\nAs I come to the end of this review, I feel that you should know that this was the only game developed by 38 Studios before they filed for bankruptcy. 38 Studios is no more. This also means that the future of this IP is in doubt. The last I read back in 2013, there were no buyers interested in this IP Franchise when they were doing an auction to sell off their properties. Do not expect to see a sequel or anything Amalur related anytime soon. (If ever.)\n\nOverall Rating: 6.5 / 10\nAn Action-RPG with excellent combat mechanics but with little ambition. It doesn't try anything new and gives a very average overall feel to the whole thing. Worth a look though if its on a very deep discount.","November 8, 2015","true","21.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/102500/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","The minds behind Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning are certainly cultured in the world of fantasy RPGs. Ken Rolston brings his pedigree (and some Bethesda alumni with it) having worked on both The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind and its successor, Oblivion; while accomplished fantasy writer R.A. Salvatore breathes life into the world of Amalur, creating a 10,000 year history for the developers at Big Huge Games to pull from. When you factor in the fantastic art design from Todd McFarlane and the enthralling backing from retired baseball star Curt Schilling (yes, really), it’s easy to proclaim you have a veritable dream team of talent for the genre, and the exciting precedence for a new IP to really blossom.\n\nReckoning starts off on the right path, even if its beginnings are fairly derivative. Upon creating your character using a fairly limited creation system, you wake up amongst a pile of festering, rotting corpses. You were previously dead yourself but have since awoken: a successful lab experiment and the latest in a long line of video game protagonists suffering from a contrived bout of amnesia. Before long you discover you’re quite the unique prospect in the land of Amalur: one without a pre-determined destiny. This is a world governed by fate, its residents able to visit fortune tellers to see how they’ll end up; left to live their lives on a decided path. Only the Tuatha – an evil race of elves – are able to be resurrected once they pass, so the fact you’re the first non-immortal to do so has shifted the balance of the kingdom and left you without the burden of a preordained life – a blank slate ready to be crafted.\n\nNot only is this a superb premise for the narrative that unfolds but, as you can imagine, it also factors into the gameplay and character building. There are three archetypal RPG classes to choose from: Might (warrior), Finesse (rogue) and Sorcery (mage). Each presents itself with different skill trees but you’re not asked to pick one, singular class. Instead, you’ll dump points into different active and passive abilities on each tree, allowing you to mix and match classes. This allows a fantastic amount of freedom and variation as you’re able to craft a skill set of your choosing, perhaps mixing together Finesse and Sorcery to create a stealthy magic-user, or combining all three sets together to reap the rewards of a well-rounded jack-of-all-trades.\n\nDepending on what path you choose you’re granted with multiple destinies that provide you additional stat bonuses. So if you choose Might you may find increased damage multipliers or supplementary health, while someone combining both Might and Sorcery may receive a bonus to elemental damage and improved mana regeneration. It’s a meritorious system that encourages experimentation, the lore endorsing re-specialisation if you want to try another path.\n\nOf course, that will come down to how you want to play Reckoning. Each class brings with it its own set of weapons, from longswords and giant hammers, through to daggers, longbows and staffs. Their over-the-top designs provide a sense of personality, while more unconventional weaponry like the chakrams and faeblades offer a welcome change of pace from the more regular fantasy tropes.\n\nWhichever set you choose you’ll find a simple one-button setup. There are no elaborate combinations for increasingly complicated attacks (whether you’re using a mouse and keyboard or a gamepad), instead you’ll time and change the pace of button presses to execute different combos. It’s easy to pick up and play and there’s a nice fluidity to the way it handles, allowing you to go from using a staff, to slicing guys up with a pair of daggers before switching to a variation of magical, elemental attacks. It hits hard and is very satisfying; Reckoning‘s bevy of diverse enemy types requiring a smattering of dodges, blocks and counters to stay out of trouble. Crowd control is often the name of the game, facing off against big and small foes; magic-users and straight up brawlers. It keeps you on your toes, the game’s loot-driven nature repeatedly throws up new weapons to starve off any sense of tedium.\n\nIt’s the side quests that invoke the greatest sense of apathy – and even implicate the combat in some major ways. Along your travels you’ll encounter an overwhelming amount of quest givers; your map quickly filling up with blinking lights like it’s Christmas at Rockefeller Centre. This cluster of side quests and tasks offer little but middling content despite their increasingly high numbers. Collect x amount of items or kill y amount of enemies; it’s unimaginative and provides a stark reminder of Reckoning’s MMO beginnings (and its future), drudging up mundane and repetitive quests to pad out the content. None of it is compulsory, of course, but when a game is stacked with 200 or so quests, it would be nice if some of them were the least bit enjoyable.\n\nIf you do decide to partake in any number of these quests then there’s also a real threat your character will over-level, negating any sort of difficulty the combat once had. You’ll often find yourself fighting enemies with grey names, indicating they are no match for your combat prowess; it’s a wonder they don’t flee in horror at the sight of you. This seems like a major oversight, particularly for a game as action-oriented as Reckoning is. The combat may be fantastic but it’s still relatively simple. If you play too many side quests the formula becomes rote, and that simplicity just can’t carry a hundred hour game. Reckoning may be a loot driven game, but no reward is worth the banality the side quests offer.\n\nFortunately, the main quest line and faction quests are eminently better. Your character may be an emotionless entity, but the rest of the writing and voice acting elevates the narrative’s quality. There are branching storylines, interesting and set-piece driven combat scenarios, enjoyable boss fights and plenty of exotic locales.\n\nFor the world of Amalur is a large place with distinct areas for you to explore. It doesn’t encourage exploration as much as something like Skyrim, instead opting to funnel you down corridors between much larger areas; but it’s a vast game world with plenty to see, the art style shining through despite its poor draw distance and some low-res textures. The desert area provokes an oddly befitting Wild West vibe with its orange hues and rocky mountains, while the wide open plains of Erathell are transcendent with their use of space and colour. Reckoning might not have the graphical fidelity of some of its counterparts, but its bright colour palette, excellent art design and smooth level of performance is certainly an aspect to be lauded. The orchestral score helps too: it’s often riveting, inciting a sense of enchantment and wonder, beckoning on your adventure. It’s really phenomenal throughout.\n\nThe same cannot be said for all of Reckoning’s many parts, however, but there’s an enjoyable game here with some interesting ideas – providing you stick closely to the main quest line and faction quests. The drabness and profusion of the side activities is too big a dampener to ignore, especially once it significantly impacts the gratification of its combat. If you treat Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning as a shorter, story-driven experience, you’ll have a much better time of it than the completionist who chases every single side quest.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","March 15, 2014","true","101.9"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","0"

Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ starts off as a great concept and at first it seems like a really fun hack and slash with a lot of customisation and strong RPG-Elements.\nBut it isn't. You'll find yourselfe spamming the same 3 combos all the time while getting annoyed of hundrets of MMORGP-like Sidequests.\nI heared you people love +/- Lists so here you go!\n\nThe Good\n+ Character customisation. You really have a lot of options and skills to chose from. You can also customise the apperance of your charater but the options are very limited so don't expect it to be as complex as in TES-Games.\n\n+ Voice Acting. Honestly i haven't seen the entire game but so far i think all NPCs where well voiced. With one huge exception. Your own character. All your character has are texts you can choose in Dialoges and the "uh" "uah" "ah" in combat. This actally doesn't bother me too much as it's already a common thing in a lot of RPGs.\n\n+ Open World. There is actally a lot of loot and other stuff to look for. Would be a huge + if the game was genarally good.\n\n+ Decisions. Yay! I cannot tell you how much effect they have on the world around you but at least you can make some.\n\nThe Meh\n~ Enemies. Not much variety for such a huge world but many of them require unique strategies to deal with them without losing too much life. For many of them it's recommended to learn their attacks and how to counter them.\n\nThe Bad\n- Generic MMORPG feeling. The Quests are getting boring after the first few hours and even if there is a huge effort to make the Quests interesing, it still felt like brainless EXP-grinding.\n\n- Tons of Sidequests. Wait, how is that a bad thing? Well if the game isn't fun at all you don't want to waste hours over hours doing minor stuff so you can keep up with the level of your enemies.\n\n- Combat. If the combat gets dull and boring in a game build around combat nothing else can safe the game from a bad score. The combat it repetitive and boring. At first it seems fresh and fun but after a few hours in you'll see how boring it gets when you spam the same stuff over and over again with the wepons(s) of your choice.\n\n- Bugs. Tbh i haven't encountered any but i haven't made it far enough into the game to get to the buggy parts of it. Quests cannot be completed if you do stuff in the wrong order and things like that. So a lot of save slots are highly recommended.\n\n- EA Account. Yes, it's one of those games where you have to make a third party account and have to be online to play a singleplayer game.\n\n- Inventory. A barely sorted List of Stuff, that you can only extend buying a limited Number of Backpacks from some NPCs. This is the Part where you clearly see that this game is a console port.\n\n3.5/10 Because EA didn't pay me","July 15, 2015","false","17.0"," 22 of 45 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","22","45","0","0"

If you can stomach those flaws then you'll probably like the game.\n\n\n-Story and Charcters are your every cliche in a fantasy setting. Overall the story isn't interesting and the characters aren't compelling. It's hard to even care much for most of the NPCs.\n\n-They use the same voice actors multiple times and it starts to get weird that every other character or NPC sounds about the same.\n\n-Invisible walls! Tiny pieces of cobblestone or rocks can become impassable although you should by all rights be able to walk over it. You're basically a demigod near the end and you still can't jump over certain terrain that visually you should be able to.\n\n-The game has a lot of tedious fetch quest and it hurts since your character runs so slowly.\n\n-The travel time between quests. Fast travel helps but you most of the quests are in between locations and you have to run slowly looking for items or NPCs.\n\n-Very stiff contorls. It basically means that combos can often become awkward and that you can't cancel an attack once you click on the button. It just feels so STATIC although the attack animations and combos plus different weapon tactics are somewhat entertaining the first time around.\n\n-Crafting in the game is a chore and more of an afterthought. You'll have no reason to use it once your character is upgraded enough and you can find better items through loot drops or chests.\n\n\nWhen it was released it had nothing new to offer the genre and it didn't age gracefully either.","May 18","false","3.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

It has two things going for it: the story is alright (I especially liked the Teeth of Naros DLC) and the visuals are bloody amazing. However, the game is simply littered with horrendous design choices that make it fall short. Its name should be Extreme Walking Simulator. 1% of the game is talking to people, fighting etc while the other 99% is bloody walking; and the map is gigantic!

For example, towards the middle/end of the game there is a gnome city where to get the side quest you go to the very back corner of a house and then to finish the fetch quest you have to go the very back of another house and then of course go back to the quest giver to finish the quest.  There doesn't appear to be any sort of design choice for that other than making the quest take longer.  The amount of side quests also showed just how forgetable the main story quest was.  I don't recall much if any of the main quest because there would sometimes be hours and hours between times you did something related to the main story quest.\n\nAs 'big' as this game is.  It feels empty.  Almost every area you go to is super similar.  You go to a new area, there will be one town or a larger city to get quests from, then there is a bunch of caves/tombs/ruins to fulfil those quests.  A lot of those caves/tombs/ruins all feel the same because you do the same thing in each.  You enter the side quest area at one end, go to the end of the area, finish your quest and then a new path opens up to send you back to the beginning.  As well each of these areas feel like copies of each other with different colour pallets.  Half of these areas could  have been removed and more time/focus spent on bigger and better side quests that actually felt rewarding.\n\nAs well there is a serious problem with enemies in this game, as in, there is not near enough of them.  There appears to be a set of them and then a bunch of recolours or with a different weapon or something.  There was hardly an variety in the enemies making each area again feel like copies of previous areas.\n\nThe one positive I'm going to give this game is the amount of lore they've packed into it.  If you complete all the side quests/faction quests and main quest you will have a lore overload and if thas your thing this game has it.","December 20, 2014","false","84.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The combat is good-ish, but is hampered by the fact that the game even on hard mode isn't actually hard (infact I'd say that hard is very easy, especially if you try to finish all the quests in each zone and get overgeared).  I would not recommend this game because this game lacks the polish that I'd expect from a single player RPG, and lacks the multiplayer advantages from an MMORPG.  I completed the first four zones or so and found the game to be just too easy/monotonous to be enjoyable, and thus will not be finishing the entire thing.

The combat is alright but it gets very repetitive because combat is all you ever do. The crafting system is interesting but it isn't enough to save this game. The music is nothing memorable, but can't say anything bad about it either. Also, there is a game ending glitch in the Dead Kel DLC, so beware of that.

Clearly the intent of the game was that of combining the free roaming experience of the former and the excitement provided by the flashy combat system of the latter. It works in the beginning, but the over all low level difficulty of the game devoids the combat system of its appeal soon enough, and the plot does not hold to the pressure. The level of involvement in the story- which is not that bad to be honest, but fairly standard nevertheless - is in the average simply not enough.\nIn my personal experience it proves once more that in this particular genre the gameplay should not be the main focus of the gamedesign process. If you look at Planescape Torment or Morrowind you can see how plot, characterisation and context provide the core of the best gaming RPG experience.\n\nKoA is fine if you are looking for a more casual experience or you are not that much into the genre.

But heres why I cant recommend this game. The FOV. The FOV in this game is stuck at about 3 feet from the rear of your character and the camera controls are wonky. The mod that fixes this issue is out there but the game didnt realy make me feel like it was worth searching for. Plus the ingame menues are ♥♥♥♥. They feel like they were ripped right out of the first Fable game.","January 2","false","10.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Little weapon variety, what weapons there are all have the same attacks, just press one attack button. Same monsters throughout the entire game, they just give them different names.  Main quest line is very boring and repetitive. Go into this castle and fight horde after horde of people to kill this boss, all while just pressing one button to attack               *yawn*. Feels like an MMO but it is single player so the whole world feels very empty and lonely and not fun to explore. If you go the rogue class good luck getting any gear. 14 hours of gameplay and i still had the starting gear they gave me in the tutorial because everything else was for casters or warriors.

It is fun to be way overpowered (I played as a mage) and right from the gate you obliterate enemies left right and centre. This is good! It is exactly what I wanted from a game like this. It played well, smoothly and looks great in a very stylised fashion. What I didn't expect however is how DEEP and STEEPED this game is in lore. I can honestly say 90% of my play time (no joke) is reading and remembering characters/NPC's. I thought this was a little strange until I found out that Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning was originally intended as an MMO (something that I feel would have made for a totally different review!) and it changed how I played the game after that. I absorbed as much of the story as I needed and moved on in proper MMO style (and boy was I happier for it!) but it made for a hollow experience as it is (literally!) an MMO world and Lore with no other players...\n\nSo what do I think of this? Your experience will vary. It is a fun but very lonely experience with a ton of very cool story that you can delve as deep into as you like. Is it tedious? Yes. Is it huge? Yes. Is it fun? Yes. Was it designed for single players? Not really.","December 5, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(I played alot more offline)\nWhile this deployment was in 2014 and it is now 2016 i figured i'd give it a review. Though the game seemed slow at first when i first bought it. It was colorful. It reminded me of the old days of world of warcraft. Well the colors the graphics and thats about it. Set in a diffirent fantasy world this game help revive my love for RPG's. The game had an interesting story line. You actually died? hmm interesting. I was hoping i'd get to stay my zombie self for eternity but eventually you just become more and more human again it seemed. With some awesome powers to change peoples Fate. Overall the game is good but had a lot of bugs and wierd boss fights which were enjoyable. Wish there was faster combat but there wasnt. And how to end this review on a good note... well i guess it was more like a story a story of a fate of a man who got lost in tablet screen playing this game on his downtime in afghanistan.

Clearly the intent of the game was that of combining the free roaming experience of the former and the excitement provided by the flashy combat system of the latter. It works in the beginning, but the over all low level difficulty of the game devoids the combat system of its appeal soon enough, and the plot does not hold to the pressure. The level of involvement in the story- which is not that bad to be honest, but fairly standard nevertheless - is in the average simply not enough.\nIn my personal experience it proves once more that in this particular genre the gameplay should not be the main focus of the gamedesign process. If you look at Planescape Torment or Morrowind you can see how plot, characterisation and context provide the core of the best gaming RPG experience.\n\nKoA is fine if you are looking for a more casual experience or you are not that much into the genre. It's by no means a bad game, but I would not recommend it to an experienced gamer.","September 29, 2014","false","73.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
