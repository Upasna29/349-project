"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RickyRays/recommended/34900/","RickyRays","Ricky Rays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RickyRays/","162 products in account","Bad Rats is a revolutionary first person shooter that sets a new standard for this era of gaming. This is game published by Electronic Arts and is developed by Dice on the new Frostbite 4 engine to provide a superior graphic fidelity compared to other marvellous titles including Crisis 3. The story of the game takes place in the year 2035 when North Korea officially ends the cease fire for the Korean War and launches  a series of surprise attacks on the United States of America and South Korea. North Korea launches an overwhelming amount of long range ballistic missiles towards major metropolitan areas in the United States which devastates the population and cripples the infrastructure of the government to be able to function properly to contain control of the United States. North Korea launches a full scale aerial campaign on Seoul with a relentless wave of troops pouring across the DMZ of North Korea and South Korea. China and the rebuilt Soviet Union organized by Vladimir Putin has been supplying North Korea with highly advanced military technology and expertise has secretly been supporting North Korea for a war since 2006! You play as a squad in the Navy Seals for the United States called “Bad Rats” Your objective is to assassinate all cats in the region of Asia to cut off all food supplies from the North Koreans and collapse the regime of Kim Jong Un. Using the destructible environments from the Frostbite 4 engine you must use the environment for a tactical advantage to exterminate all cats from Asia. Fan favourite maps return including Seige of Shainghai where you must collapse a skyscraper to kill all cats in the building.  Facial scanning technology from LA Noire returns to add an extra layer of realism with realistic facial animation movements to add more emotion to the already immersive world. This is a highly addicting shooter that takes place in locations across the world from nuclear wasteland America to the glorious lands of North Korea.  You have a massive arsenal of over 500 weapons to use with thousands of gadgets and gun camouflages. Bad Rats is integrated with the Steam Workshop which has created thousands of community maps and gun skins to be submitted into the game for future free DLCs called “Operations”. Each operation adds an extra layer of immersion into the game with a huge variety of community maps and skins to be added to expand the already masterpiece of a game. Bad rats is a very skill based shooter and requires extensive training to truly shine in multiplier. Bad Rats is the only first person shooter on the market to add a innovative competitive mode with ranks to determine your skill level. In multiplayer there are 2 teams. Counter Cats and Cats. The counter cats must plant a bomb on one of the two locations on the map to kill the population of cats in the area. The cats must prevent the counter cats or the “bad rats” from planting the bomb by either killing all the Counter Cats or defusing the bomb to save the population of cats in the premise.Bad Rats is a highly addicting shooter that any seasonal gamer should try out but I assume you already have! Bad Rats global sales have exceeded 1 billion on the first day outselling the Call of Duty franchise. It is very rare to see game a game this flawless since the release of Half Life 2. If you like first person shooter games you already own bad rats, if you don't you are missing out on one of the most brilliant game of this century.\n\nFinal verdict\n\nPros\nImmersive environments\nBalanced multiplayer\nOverwhelming amount of content\nGorgeous Graphics\nRevolutionizes the FPS genre\nFantastic and inspiring story\nGreat voice acting\nLike Half Life 3 but better\n\nCons\nToo much graphics\n\n10/10","January 7, 2015","true","1.4"," 864 of 971 people (89%) found this review helpful 924 people found this review funny","89","864","971","924","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bwettfett/recommended/34900/","bwettfett","Bwettfett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bwettfett/","591 products in account","This game....\n\nThe storyline involves a group of a rogue military unit who have turned on their Cat superiors. In the year 20XX, hope rides alone as the single group of rats moves forward in a near futile attempt to usurp the catriarchy.\n\nTouching on heavy and mature themes such as sexism, xenophobia, coming of age and even existentialism, the decisions you make in this game echo thoughout the game's final act.\n\nGameplay wise, this game's controls are responsive and intuitive,  and the multiple difficulty selections such as "Bad Rat must Die" mode and the aptly titled "The Rat's Revengeance" mode make this game possibly the most non-artifical difficulty challenge ever crafted by human hands.\n\nThe graphics look even better than Deadly Premonition, and I thought that wasn't possible. This game looks just like what kids of the late 80's thought video-games might look like in the late 2020's.\n\nLastly, the sound is fantastic. With an OST rivaling the Sonic game Bioware did for the DS, smooth MIDI guitars will comfort you throughout tense and dramatic scenes.\n\n\nOverall, this game is one of the best games I've ever played. My only complaint is that the game's ending leaves much to be desired, with a cliff-hanger involving the protaganist's brother being one of the Cats all along being followed by an after-credits dance scene to the catchy smash hit "All-Star" by Smash Mouth.\n\n\n10/10","January 10, 2014","true","0.5"," 363 of 417 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","363","417","8","5"

Buying this game was one of the greatest life choices I've made, next to masturbating with a fleshlight made out of an abnormally long umbilical cord.\n\nI've had plenty of experience with murder, terrorism, manslaughter, necrophilia, and pedophilia, so this game was right up my alley. I feel I can connect better with our true lord and saviour, Satan, after playing this game. The gameplay is very challenging and make my insides tingle similar to when I insert a cheese grater into my sphincter. The sound of the bones of the cat getting dissolvied into splinters gets the urine pumping faster than a Jew getting out of a shower. The true euphoria of completing a puzzle can only be described in three words: Japanese Rope Bondage.\n\nOverall, this game has fulfilled every single one of my fetishes, which I was surprised the developers would know about my anal seepage fetish. I'd give it a 9.5/10, since no game can be perfect. I could use more visible spinal cords here and there, but in general a great game.

I don't mind the character unlocking process but I wish it didn't take 200+ hours to unlock the most powerful rat type. The graphical aesthetic is pleasing and it runs as smoothly as source.

I just don't think its worth $1.09cdn. Only bother adding this game to your library unless its a gift or its a 90% sale. Once this occours you can easily make profit from playing the best game imaginable.\n\nBAD Rats is the first ever true multi-genre game on the steam market, being a survival horror, third person shooter, historical, space simulation, RTS, MOBA, Christian Educational Game.\n\nThe games plot revolves around trying to teach the consumer about the misconceptions of ebola. Before i played this game i was under the impression that ebola wasn't in my country but i now know that it in fact has infected the global population through airborne transfer. It also teaches you that you can cure ebola by bathing in honey and then applying peanut butter. Fantastic\n\nPros-\n-Amazing Graphics\n-Revolutionairy Mechanics\n-Outstanding PVP gamemodes\n-Servers have 100% uptime. This game has the best co-op imaginable\n\nCons-\n-Some levels where co-designed by the anti-christ and are impossible to beat without a walkthrough\n-Completely unoriginal concept clearly stolen from the groundbreaking game DOTA 2\n-Character progression has too many items and is therefore impossible to understand\n-Some graphics stolen from well known games such as pong and realm of the mad god\n-The "bad rats puzzle gun" is actually just a rat that uses the portal gun from the famous game portal 2 and the mechanic is glitchy\n-The tutorial is absolute crap (actually tho) it doesn't teach you 99% of the game mechanics.\n-In the credits they leave out the obvious inspiration from star wars episode 3, a new home.\n\nSo, i was going to give this game a healthy 9/11 but then i realized the absolute misfourtune of this game. After you have played this game you will lose the ability to play any game besides bad rats. Due to this unfortunate compulsion I will have to rate this game 0/10 while i go ddos the multiplayer servers to save the poor souls suffering from christian educational game addiction.\n\nI hope this review was helpful and please click the yes if you liked it :)","December 12, 2014","false","10.4"," 281 of 353 people (80%) found this review helpful 228 people found this review funny","80","281","353","228","4"

Eventually I managed to magically get the game to show on my monitor and had the option to change to one of three resolutions ... all of which were 4:3 aspect ratio and all of them very low. Not a good start!\n\nOnce the game started, it was not quite as horrible as I had been lead to believe. The core concept was sound. You have a variety of objects and rats with special abilities. You use these objects and rats to guide a ball around several obstacles to hit something that will britally murder the captive cat in a humourous but not safe for children manner. And in general the game works .... I mean OK the physics are a little unpredictable and you may have to run the same solution a few times before it succeeds, but the basic game works and is suprisingly entertaining.\n\nBut it just feels like they got a prototype game made and released it with no polish, plenty of bugs, and made for computers not sold this century. This is a case of a good idea that just missed the mark in every other way outside of that great idea.\n\nOddly enough I hope the developers don't give up and keep trying because something about this game just made me wish it had not been crap.","December 30, 2014","false","2.7"," 194 of 241 people (80%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","80","194","241","14","12"

It's ironic that a company named "Strategy First" published this game, because due to the physics reacting differently each time your play, you constantly have to adjust your strategy to succeed in this game. I'm not sure whether I should call this artificial difficulty or designer oversight.

It sets the story for the game making your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic experience 100x better.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD\nIncase you haven't read the book here is the basic story. A kind artist's mother was poisened by a Goblin Rat Man pretending to be a doctor. He climbed the ranks within the Government to become the Leader of his country. He met a friend from high school at a reuinion called Joe. Joe helped him create 'The Final Solution' This is where the game picks up. You must eliminate all of the filthy vermin that plague your wonderful and graphically monumental world\n\nPros\n\n-Amazing Graphics\n-Story Rich\n-The Only Real Solution To Vermin Jews\n-We Must Aid The Final Solution\n\nCons\n-Hard For Racial Minorities To Play\n-Require You To Understand A Lot Of Rich Backstory\n\n\nOverall Verdict\n\nOverall this game is a master piece. The only real way we can exteminate the vermin. Thank you Adolf and Joesph for this masterpiece!\n\n9/11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE HELP ME THE DEVS HAVE ME LOCKED UP AND ARE FORCING ME TO WRITE THIS REVIEW IM AT 1314 Smegma Lane.","September 27, 2015","true","0.2"," 124 of 144 people (86%) found this review helpful 128 people found this review funny","86","124","144","128","0"

A great evil has risen. A hero wil rise. A Bad rat.\nBad Rats is a FPS Shooter MMO where YOU the player create your very won Rat. You choose from 6 diffrent classes. Each classes has their own special skills and skill trees. It's a joy to watch your Rat level up and get new perks. The story is pretty good. You have to save the planet Terminus from an unkown danger. As you No Scope hordes of enemies you discover more lore and history about Terminus. As we all know Bad Rats is a sequel to Superman 64 and it worth your money. Allthough i did feel like the online system should have been better. It is an MMO, but there is very little you can do with your friends besides deathmatches and Quick scope 1v1. Anyway to sum it up Bad Rats is a really good game. It has tight controls, beatiful graphics, nice gameplay and a interresting story. And i can't wait to hit my 500 hour.\n\nEnjoy The Game","November 2, 2014","true","0.3"," 97 of 113 people (86%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","86","97","113","41","2"

As I edged closer to climax I felt a ghostly breeze brush against my buttery nips. An eerie green hand emmerged from my throbbing purple bellend and pointed towards todays deals on steam. I hypnotically released my mighty grasp from my pulsating, crimson shaft and without hesitation, bought the first game in the list. I launch it, still very aroused.

I could not resist the atmosphere of death in the room and inserted my ♥♥♥♥♥ into my cat's limp body, filling it rapidly with millky goodness.... the cat burst; its intestines flew out and wrapped around my neck.

Well, it's kind of a long story. It was a dark and stormy night.  My mother and father were walking down the sidewalk with me.  Our house was across the street.  We started to cross together and made it halfway through, when suddenly we saw two bright white lights coming at us so fast that my father barely had enough time to push me across the street.  All I heard was a loud *klunk*, then it all went black.  I awoke and saw my mother and father soaked with blood in the middle of the street, while a big yellow cat with a scar over his left eye sped away faster than the speed of sound.  After that night, I had devoted my life to get revenge by cleaning up all of the filth that was on the streets once and for all.  I trained hard and recruited many fellow rats to fight for my cause.  We all had one enemy, the cats.  We had all been dealing with them for way too long.  They would threaten us, beat us, kill us, and they even took away the ones we loved.  It was our time to shine.  We loaded up with cannons, bows and arrows, baseball bats, and even vacuums.  We were ready to clean up all of the trash on our streets once and for all.  The first cat was tough to kill, since we had no idea what we would be up against.  We lost Jerry and Milton in the process, but we all knew what was on the line in order to exterminate all of the cats.  After the 10th cat, we didn't even pay attention to the ones that had died because we had become used to it.  After 20, it seemed that some were just killing the cats for sport.  The 30th cat was a bit stronger.   It had wiped out over half of our entire army, but Crazy Steve strapped on his vest and let himself get swallowed, where he detonated the cat and saved many of our lives that day.  I will never forget the sacrifice he made.  It was a rough day.  Cat 39 had killed all but 8 of us.  There was only one left.  The next day, I saw him.  He had a scar.  It was him.  It was the one who had killed my parents.  I had trained my whole life for this moment.  I had done everything I could to get the revenge I wanted.  It was my moment.  The first rat had blown himself up, along with the second rat.  The third rat ran right into the cat and was devoured almost instantly.  The fourth rat shot his bow and arrow straight up into the air and it went straight through his skull.  The fifth rat had fallen on the sixth rat and crushed him, then was ran over by the seventh rat's bulldozer, who then was blown up by the sixth rat's bomb vest.  It was just me.  Me against the one who had killed my family.  The one who had taken everything away from me when I was a child.  The one who ruined my life and the sole reason of my hatred for cats.  That didn't matter anymore.  All I wanted was my revenge.  I took the seventh rat's bulldozer, and I went full speed right up the cat's pooper.  With my bomb vest on, I drove up as far as I could.  I drove through his intestines and all around.  I did all I could do in order to win.  I didn't care anymore.  I was almost there.  I could almost taste the sweet revenge.  I strapped the vest to the cat's heart, drove as fast as I could out of the cat's mouth.  I was on his tongue when the blast went off.  I was launched out of his mouth, and I watched as his eyes popped out of his skull and his head exploded and his guts went everywhere.

Among it's various sins include blatant typos, unclear measurement units, terrible grammar, and awful physics that ruin the very heart of the game itself. I mean, what kind of physics-based puzzle game do you have when the physics malfunction half of the time? Balls flying out into an unneccessary third dimension, assuming you even correctly triggered your first step with your rat set at 38 Rat Angular Units to go after 40 Rat Time Units.\n\nBut I digress, the game is flawed, to be sure. In fact as I was churning my way through this game, the livestream audience goading me on as though demons with lashes made of fire and thorns, I began to see this game for what it was; Divine retribution. After thirty maps or so, when blood from my very eyes began to splatter my keyboard, I truly understood why Bad Rats was put on this planet.\n\nInitially, I began to lose faith. As would any man, I questioned many things during this trial. "Why would God do this to me? Why would a God of 'Good' let a game such as 'Bad Rats' Ever be created?" And on and on I questioned. I questioned God's purpose, my purpose, and the purpose of the tormentor who had begun to work my fingers to the very bone.\n\nFinally, it dawned on me.\n\nA game of such pure agony, such pure punishment, could never have been crafted by mortal hands. At last I realized that the only reason God would allow such a travesty as Bad Rats into this world is to be an obstacle to overcome to understand that truly he exists. To be sure, Bad Rats may have been programmed by "imagine4" but the developer was none other than Christ Jesus. How else would such a perfect trial have been crafted but through the intervention of the only being that could craft the cosmos into the reality that you and I enjoy every day? That is the power that was put into Bad Rats. That is the power that has turned this game into an engine of languish.\n\nI highly reccomend Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge, but know that you should not accept such a task lightly. You may experience Bad Rats different from the way I did, but nonetheless you will emerge from it a changed person.","December 30, 2013","true","2.9"," 68 of 75 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","68","75","0","2"

He said that one day evil would come, and it would be so horrific that even uttering its name would kill you. He then said that he was dying of eye cancer because he saw someone who saw a screenshot of the game. He leaned in and said, I will use my life, so you can safe many more.  He whispered the words "Bad Rats" then coughed up blood and died.\n\nIt wasn't until the following June that I would discover what was so horrible about this abomination. I lived in the small town of Canuckville Canada.  A man across the street had bought a gaming computer ,first ever in the town, I was invited to watch him play his first game.  When I got there, there were six other people gathered around the computer waiting to watch him. He was about to start a game, when I left the room to get a soda.\n\nWhen I came back, there were 6 charred bodies lying around the computer. and a pile of ash in the gamer's seat. The screen was too covered in soot to see, but I know one thing. I had to turn the computer off. I leapt for the cord, but as I was falling my left eye caught the title screen "Bad Rats: How To Kill A Cat". I ripped the cord from the walled. The entire left side of my face was burned. Not just a burn for heat. A burn from shear evil.\n\nWhile I was burying the computer, blood started to fall from the skies. Anyone who touched the blood began to turn. They started to grow thick matted hair and shirk to the size of a half-gallon bottle of maple syrup. Then they became more and more aggressive, biting and clawing people who look at them. Anyone bitten would also turn.\n\nI did what anyone would do. Myself and two others gathered everyone in the Town hall, and burned in down. The rats burned green, because magnets. I left for the states, but two others stayed in Canada. I was searching for the developers of Bad Rats.\n\nAnd then.\n\nI found them.\n\nJuly 19th, 2008. That was the day I broke open the door. I used my squad of highly trained ninja cats to kill the majority of the smaller rats. After much fighting with lightsabres and LAZOR-CANNONS, there was only one rat left alive. The largest. Ugliest rat that has ever existed. I charged him, but I was pushed back by if use of the force...The dark side of it. I then took out my wand and stunned him long enough for me to cut both his legs off.\nI left him there, in the chamber floor. Blood-soaked with no hope of survival. No arms or legs. No family. No friends. Almost has bad as he left my hometown.\n\nA year later I met the girl of my dreams and started a family. I worked at a small accounting firm just south of the highway. I was happy. My life was finally good. Then one day come home. My kids don't come to greet me. Total silence. I take a few steps in the house, the silence deafening. I search the house but no one is there. No sign of a struggle. No sign of them even leaving. Until I go into the basement.\n\nMy kids are beheaded. My wife's eyes are seared out of the sockets. Horrified I search for the cause. I found out what game Timmy pre-ordered... "Bad Rats: The Rats Revenge" My new life was gone. Empty. Only my dog was left... Who remained alive, but with no legs. I am still training him to use is bionic limbs and laser beams, his Iron-Doge suit if you will.\nbut my life will never be the same. I will never love another woman. Buy another house. Or play another game until I know that rat is dead.\n\n\nThat is why it is called "The Rats Revenge"\n\n\nOther than the horrible PTSD it has caused me... I still think it is worth a buy, only so you can warn others in the review.\n","July 11, 2014","true","104.0"," 54 of 56 people (96%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","96","54","56","9","3"

The player must use various kind of specially trained rats to direct a ball towards an item that will kill the cat. If you - like me - are tired of people posting cat pictures on the Internet or cat videos on Youtube, this game will definitely put a smile on your face. Take some acid in the face, dumb ugly cat!\n\nThe game uses an innovative random physics system to be completely different from other Incredible Machine style puzzle games. Each attempt will produce a different result, even if you do not change the position of your rats at all. It keeps the game fresh and interesting during your journey through its 44 breathtaking levels, as no attempt is exactly the same. Sometimes the developer-given solutions won't work either, in which case you must find a solution of your own. Or repeat the developer solution until it works, it's all your choice as a player. Much more meaningful than the choices that Mass Effect 3 gave its players.\n\nWhile the game may look 2.5D (a sidescroller with 3D graphics), do not be fooled by the screenshots. The game is fully rendered in 3D, including the physics. The ball can and will move on the Z axis. Usually this is not in your favor, but it does a good job showcasing the 3D random physics engine lovingly crafted by the creative minds at Invent4 Entertainment. Sadly, there is no level editor included in the game so people can't experiment with the engine themselves.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game. The only bad part of the game I can think of is that it is quite short. Most people will finish the game in about 4 hours. But the game usually goes all the way down to 0.40€ on Steam sales, which is not much at all for a few hours of great cat-killing time! Gift it to your friends too, they will appreciate it.","November 25, 2013","true","9.7"," 214 of 299 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","214","299","0","0"

This game is God's nectar itself; the scrotum that sits gently on the MOBA genre. Bad Rats is the main inspiration for all MOBAs of today's day and age. Meepo himself is just a feeble (and might I add less detailed) version of the rats. However, I have to acknowledge Dota 2's massive graphical improvement over Bad Rats. They said it couldn't be done, but adding a whole 5 pixels to the game really did make it stand above the rest. Bad Rats is neither changing nor evolving, it is the perfect game which guides all others of its kind (Doto 2). It has no genre, for it is like a delta which transcends all genres of gaming. Intuitive game-mechanics drive every aspect of Bad Rats, eventually leading to the complex, unique courrier system that Dota 2 has. The versitility and viability of Bad Rats will be enjoyed for ages to come. Men will look back at the dawn of video game ingenuity, and wonder, ''How can such a masterpiece be recreated? Will there ever be another game to stand the test of time? Will Doto 3 ever come out?'' To them I say, ''No.'' Good Rats, not Bad Rats. Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. Praise it.","October 11, 2014","true","11.5"," 156 of 217 people (72%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","72","156","217","10","2"

Heck yeah, it’s bad. But it’s bad for completely different reasons than what I was expecting. In fact (and I actually can’t believe I’m hearing myself say this), I think Bad Rats could have been salvaged.\n\n(Obligatory note to achievement hunters: you're looking at about 5-7 hours. It's doable.)\n\nSo this is a physics sandbox puzzle game similar to the Incredible Machine games. The goal in each level is to senselessly murder a cat by hitting something with a ball. There’s always a ball, and you always need to get it through a physics maze so that it can activate a murder weapon. You can accomplish this by arranging some objects on the level including a team of rats who have various behaviors and reflex reactions to the ball. You get the same ten rats every level, and the same ten objects. In other words, it’s like Incredible Machine if every level had a “get the ball in the box” objective and you were given the same handful of tools each time. So far, it isn’t a terrible idea – by narrowing the focus to just a few mechanics, the level design can convey some interesting points about them. And kill me for saying it, but Bad Rats does.\n\nThe humor is sickeningly tasteless, but I honestly think nobody would be complaining about it if only the graphics weren’t so terrible. Oh, the graphics are awful. The animations look like the work of a (failing) first-year modeling student and are impossible to take seriously. If the graphics were given a coat of paint from a competent designer, we might have all been calling Bad Rats a charming and darkly humorous game. (Although I still could have done without the suicide bomb rat. I think that was going a bit too far.)\n\nAnother common complaint about this game is the non-deterministic physics: every time you hit “go,” something slightly different will happen even if you didn’t change anything. Somehow this didn’t bother me as much as it should have. Sometimes it was cool to have a range of outcomes from a single set-up without having to stress over miniscule adjustments. Also, I don’t care what game you’re playing; random spazzing physics is always funny.\n\nAgainst all odds, I had some tiny glimpses of actual fun. It was satisfying to abuse the level design, rotating pieces in clever ways to find unintended solutions. This could have been a clever, focused little puzzler.\n\nSo what makes Bad Rats so bad?\n\n*Ahem…*\n\nPHYSICS SANDBOX GAMES SHOULD NOT HAVE TIME LIMITS.\n\nPHYSICS SANDBOX GAMES SHOULD NOT HAVE ATTEMPT LIMITS.\n\nPHYSICS SANDBOX GAMES SHOULD NOT HAVE GAME OVERS.\n\nAll of the game’s faults are magnified by twenty because you only have 10 minutes (or 6 if you’re playing on expert) to solve a puzzle, or you’re given a Game Over and booted back to the title screen.\n\nYes, you read that right. Game Overs in an Incredible Machine game. The same also happens if you push the “go” button 100 times in one level. What the actual hell?\n\nYou can save your game to avoid this tragic fate, but sometimes you will forget to save, and you’ll have to re-do a dozen levels over again, or you’ll save with only like a minute left and have to wrestle with the awful UI to keep playing. That’s when the game becomes agonizing.\n\nSee, here's the main problem: the entire interface is utter garbage. And this is really the worst part of the game: not the bad animations, not the gore, not the distasteful humor, not the wonky physics, but the lazy, badly-designed UI. It is one of the worst interfaces I’ve ever seen in any game, and it hurts my brain even trying to think of ways to describe it. Buttons glitch out and will sometimes be pressed just by mousing over them. Selecting a rat requires panning the camera down, and the inventory is so badly arranged that you’ll always click the wrong item. Many puzzles require individually rotating pieces, but you have to adjust the rotation by number and there’s no way to adjust it with precision, kind of like one of those awful old alarm clocks where you had to tap lightly just to set the time or else you’d overshoot it by 30.\n\nAnd then there’s the plank. Please, do not get me started on the plank. You can never place it anywhere you want, because it will automatically rotate into walls when you’re trying to position it and there’s no way to fix it because letting go will just make it snap back to its last position, and—\n\nAlright, alright. That’s enough of my mental energy dedicated to Bad Rats. I’d better wrap this up before I get to a thousand words. God, to think I actually wrote a thousand words about this game...\n\nBad Rats is a game that’s terrible, and knows it’s terrible. It is not ashamed to wink and poke fun at itself. Yet ironically, it has no idea why it’s so bad. It’s not the bad graphics, the level design, or the gore that will drive you insane – it’s the time limits and the user interface that were forged in the fires of hell. If you remove the time limits and Game Overs, fix the interface so that you can actually control the damn game, and hire an actual graphic designer, you’re probably looking at a 6/10 game here.\n\nBut no, Bad Rats isn’t the worst game ever. It isn’t even the worst puzzle game on Steam. If you want a real stinker, go play Chaos Theory or Turba, and come back to me if you can survive for thirty minutes without demanding a refund.","January 5","false","6.4"," 59 of 70 people (84%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","84","59","70","12","0"

It is one of the best physics puzzle releases in the recent history of videogames.

Do you remember when you first got your hands on Super Mario 64, the excitement that oozed out of you when you picked up the pad and controlled Mario around in 3D for the first time? Or when you were pulling out the Master Sword from its stone placement in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time? These were special moments in a gamer’s life and playing Bad Rats deserves to be placed alongside such events.\n\nIn a gaming world populated by companies able to throw millions of pounds at tired franchises that sell on their name alone and where genuine innovation and fresh ideas should be welcomed with open arms, there's no better game to throw your weight behind than Bad Rats.

Don't you think?\n\n\n- What would you call that flavor?\n- Lightning-y?\n\n\nYeah. It's lightning-y!\nWe got to do that again.\n\n\nOkay, when the next storm comes,\nwe'll go up on the roof...\n\n\nI know what this needs! Saffron!\nA little saffron would make this!\n\n\nSaffron.

Rebel spaceships,\nstriking from a hidden base, have won their first\nvictory against the evil Galactic Empire.\n\nDuring the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal\nsecret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the\nDeath Star, an armored space station with enough\npower to destroy an entire planet.\n\nPursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess\nLeia races home aboard her starship, custodian of\nthe stolen plans that can save her people and\nrestore freedom to the galaxy...\n\nThe awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total\neclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny\nsilver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers\nfrom the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed\nby a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly\nlaserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing\nthe main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY\n\nAn explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-\nD2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way\nthrough the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are\nold and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His\nface is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.\nThreepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of\nhuman proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic\nsurface of an Art Deco design.\n\nAnother blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDid you hear that? They've shut down\nthe main reactor. We'll be destroyed\nfor sure. This is madness!\n\nRebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in\nthe main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe're doomed!\n\nThe little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that\nonly another robot could understand.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThere'll be no escape for the Princess\nthis time.\n\nArtoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as\nloud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment\nare heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat's that?\n\nEXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE\n\nThe Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade\nRunner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the\nunderside dock of the giant Imperial starship.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\nThe nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a\ntremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and\na score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make\ntheir way into the smoke-filled corridor.\n\nIn a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with\nlaserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns\ncreating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck\nbehind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers\nwho scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered\narms and faces.\n\nAn explosion hits near the robots.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI should have known better than to\ntrust the logic of a half-sized\nthermocapsulary dehousing assister...\n\nArtoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages\naround the two hapless robots.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY\n\nA death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.\nThe tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone\nfigure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations\nwho looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy\nhair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable\nlad with a prize-winning smile.\n\nA light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a\nlarge battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the\ndesert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided\nby a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot\nappears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.\nA bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and\nhe instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his\nutility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying\nthe heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired\nLandspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet\nabove the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the\ntiny robot to follow him.\n\nLUKE\nHurry up! Come with me! What are you\nwaiting for?! Get in gear!\n\nThe robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and\nsmoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his\narms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps\ninto his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum\nmadly.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY\n\nThe awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his\nway into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is\nDarth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured\nby his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which\nstands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the\nImperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away\nfrom the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through\nthe Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run\nin a frenzied panic.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\nA woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.\nArtoo makes beeping sounds.\n\n","December 28, 2015","true","0.1"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","87","34","39","24","0"

She was a mousy looking girl who wore rags of grey and blue. Her peers liked to tease her because of that (and other things, too).\n\nShe walked home alone, her only company the voices in her head, mocking her. They were loud, an obnoxious din, and certainly unwelcome. The girl could do nothing to make them go away. She didnt like the voices, though they were her only company.\n\nPeople often told her to perk up a little, but the girl couldnt, or maybe she just wouldnt. She couldnt understand why it was important for them to see her ''perk up''. They never noticed her, except sometimes to offer advice on how to be like them - perky and carefree.\n\nSometimes the girl thought about why she felt so different from the society around her. Life for her was like being at a party she wasnt invited to, and she didnt know how she came to be at this party. The more the girl thought about this, the more she got lost amidst her thoughts. The only escape from this maze was to slash and cut her way out untill...that day.\n\nThe day she smiled was a special day indeed! It was July 20th 2009 the release date of the game called "Bad Rats: The Rat's Revenge". Bad rats was and is the only joy in her life. seven weeks later the found her dead in her room.

With an epic, sweeping storyline that makes Metal Gear Solid 4 look like a Hardy Boys adventure, Bad Rats will keep you guessing until the very last cutscene. The plot twists keep coming and the ending is such a mindscrew that you'll be lamenting it for weeks.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game could not be better. With tight, crisp controls, you have have full dominion over your rats. The intuitive layout means that within minutes, you'll be forwarding the Rat Agenda at a breakneck speed.\n\nPhysics? The amount of research that must have gone into the physics for this game is mind-boggling. I'm told that the developers used the research works of renowned physicist James J. Rowenbarter in its development, though I don't know if that's just an internet rumor.\n\nIf I had to choose a flaw for this game, it would be that the sequel hasn't arrived yet. The ending definitely leaves the game open to interpretation--- and for a sequel. Bring on Bad Rats 2!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lolrek/recommended/34900/","lolrek","rewml","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lolrek/","76 products in account","After dedicating alot of hours into this game I decided to rewrite this review\n\nGame: Bad rats\nGenre: First-person Shooter\nDeveloper: Bad rats Team\nPublisher: Bad rats Team\n\nBad rats is a first-person shooter developed and published by Bad rats team. This is the indie darling of the year, and it deserves most of the praise that it is getting.\n\nSTORY\nThe plot follows the same gist of many meta-games: you are playing as someone playing Bad rats, and someone starts writing weird messages to you. If you are familiar with other games such as Pony Island, the game has some decent tricks up its sleave, but, unfortunately, it feels very derivative and not as smart as the aformentioned product.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe game has an interesting art-style: white environments with red enemies and black/blu-ish objects. It all looks very polished, but it got kinda old after a while. Thankfully, some Challenges change the color scheme, giving some much needed variety.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe game is a first-person shooter where time moves only when you do, and later on you also unlock the ability to swap your body with an enemy's. This is done extremely well, and you can't but be amazed at how perfectly it was achieved by the developers. Bravo!\nThe only issue I have with the gameplay are the weapons: there are only a pistol, a double-barreled shotgun, a rifle and multiple melee weapons. But still, watching a real-time replay of what you just accomplished is very satisfying.\n\nCHALLENGE\nDying with one hit makes the game very hard and quite frustrating in certain levels, but having more than one life would've trivialized the entire game. The AI is very smart and usually predicts where you are going to go, so that it can hit you always. After you got the hang on the controls, you can easily outsmart it, especially when knowing where enemies will spawn. The Challenges are also very fun to play, with different modifiers like Katana Only, Fists Only, Throws Kill and many more.\n\nSOUND\nThe soundtrack is your typical techno-pop music, and the sound effects are top notch, with sound warping when you move. The words said at the end of each level (SUPER HOT) are quite amusing at first, but they do get annoying after a while\n\nREPLAYABILITY\nThe main game is very short: it took me under two hours to complete it. However, there are plenty more things to do that will keep you coming back more and more: Challenge mode, Endless mode, secret computers hidden in every level... A game musn't be criticised only for the lenght of the main story, but on the rest of the content as well. And here, there's plenty of fun to be had.\n\nOverall, Bad rats is a very innovative and polished game that will appeal to most gamers. If you are here for the story, however, you will be disappointed by its short lenght and its expensive price. A must-buy when at 15$.\n\nStory: 7\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 9\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 7.5\nReplayability: 8.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 8.5\nFRUSTRATION: 7","August 31, 2015","true","195.2"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","87","26","30","13","0"

Why anyone thought it was a good idea, and why anyone thought that it should be made. And WHY, OH WHY ANYONE WOULD PAY MONEY FOR IT? I am proud to say, Bad Rats is not one of them. You see, there is a lesson for all of us in Bad Rats, which lies deep within its folds of marijuana, Iranians and the Cuban Mice-ile Crisis.\n\nOn the surface, Bad Rats: the Rats Revenge is a game about killing cats. You take on the role of God, with the omnipotent power of transporting both sentient creatures and inanimate objects from one portion of the screen to another. On his death bed, Steve Jobs also ordered his Chinese slaves to design you an elegant yet efficient machine capable of reversing time and spray-painting walls. Once time begins rolling, cats begin dying in horrific ways, from exploding to death in a microwave to getting mauled, chainsawed and crushed.\n\nAt its heart, Bad Rats is a physics game. You are presented with a generous supply of your average physics-game objects, such as trampolines, wooden boxes and platforms. Objects are placed on a 2D plane. This is as normal as the game gets.\n\nThe object of the game is to maneuver a small blue ball to activate the cat slaughtering machine. All machines can only be activated by this tiny blue ball. This poses an interesting quandry: no matter how many rocket mice you launch at a giant red button on the side of a microwave, it never budges. However, the slightest tap by the rolling ball will fling the button closed. These blatant violations of Newton’s laws serve to be a defining characteristic of Bad Rats. Speaking of rocket mice, there are plenty more types of rats at your arsenal: Middle Eastern terrorists that detonate bombs, cigarette addicts who can’t help but wheeze to push the ball forward, Los Angeles Dodgers junkies, and bulldozers that CAN’T DRIVE UP A SIMPLE RAMP HJKDAGGKS\n\nThe most innovative and eye-opening feature of Bad Rats, however, is no doubt the concept of 3D gameplay in a 2D game. Though you may only place objects on a 2D plane, your ball is free to move in all three dimensions, including towards the camera and outside of the gameplay region. This occurs by complete luck, and is God’s way of reminding you that life is full of unexpected surprises, and that you must always keep faith to achieve your goals.\n\nMany now believe that the developers of Bad Rats were working through the influence of the Holy Spirit, and that they ascended to heaven soon after the game was released. This would explain why they were never seen or heard from again.\n\n10/10, I’ve played better.","August 17, 2013","true","0.5"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","30","37","0","3"

Don't be scared by the premise; the develepors have crafted something that reaches far and wide delivering an experience that's akin to a playable drama film. Wash away those horrible memories of any other game and put your fears away. Bad Rats is simply incredible. Visuals and sound are two of the video game medium's greatest strengths.\nVisuals are amazing and absolutely essential to the experience, using the power of a 1980 PC to make the experience irreversibly absorbing. Sure, the technical aspect of Bad Rats are first rate, but the artistic vision of the game is where it truly shines. The environments are absolutely PACKED with detail, and build a frightfully immerse and believable world. It feels real as you traverse it. Whether it's using rats to kill a cat, using different rats to kill a cat or using more rats to kill cats, the world in Bad Rats is telling and a character in itself.

Only downside is that the devs aren't pushing for a Game of the Year Edition (IMHO though they should have a game of the century edition). Come on guys!! Pick up the slack!!\n\nThis game honestly is the best thing since sliced bread, I haven't had so much fun with a rat since the other day. Now I can't speak for meinself for the pricing but it was very cheap as it was kindly given to moi as a gift. If there's anything you want for CHRISTMAS, then  this is the game to ask for on your wisherlist, heck ask for it for any occasion such as birthdays or get well gifts.\n\nTo top it all off the best part of this gaem is the inclusion of both achievments and trading cards to mein delight, it is the best thing I have seen and pls add the option to make your own levels!! I and many other fans are counting on you!!\n\n**Also this game may require the use of gunnar optics which will add %66 more edginess to the gameplay.\n\nNOTE: There will also be a sequel, and let's all do our best to hope it doesn't become the duker nukem forever.\n\nCheck out mein sick gamer play video below, it's intense and so is the music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8aLnsHokO4","December 23, 2014","true","188.4"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","75","30","40","9","2"

Nothing in this games happens with no reason. The cat symbolises our inner evil self, and the rats symbolise our will to overcome, and become better. The gameplay itself is considered to be flawed by some, as the results of having the same setup may vary. However, just as the cats and rats symbolise our internal struggles, this seemingly random reaction at times of what should be systematic results is actually really only there to symbolise the following thing: that in life, even with the proper formula, you need luck and patience. This game is so deep, it has made me onder about several philosophical questions. I love the graphics, they are very colorful, sharp, I almost daresay sexy, and they make me happy and cheerful. The soundtrack is amazing, and I think it compares to Hotline Miami in terms of quality. In short: Gameplay: 5 Stars, Graphics: 5 Stars, Music: 5 stars. Truly an amazing game. A masterpiece, and several years ahead of its time. Try it out!","May 16","true","9.1"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","19","21","10","0"

From a player's perspective it may seem as a physics based game about killing cats, however it is so much more. The core mechanics of the game lay a very intuitive playing field. The physics are like something never before seen, think the physics of the source engine and how revolutionary it was for it's time. This game is beyond it's time, the physics as well. The trailers do nothing to capture the experience the actual game has, the only way to truly experience this revolutionary title is to play it for yourself. No words can describe the experience "Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge" has to offer, and as a Master Bad Rat I can say that I would be foolish to attempt and describe to you how the game was for me. This "game" is a piece of art, an allegory to true enlightenment. I wish that I could give you an accurate view on the game however it is simply impossible, every single review here is an attempt at interpreting an enigma. The only way for you to understand "Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge" is to become a Bad Rat.","January 12","true","115.0"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","87","20","23","10","2"

The resolution is stunning, the graphics are just amazing and the physics make the game even more immersive. The gameplay is really fun and challenging, they stimulate you into using your brain to find the solution in several different ways. It can get a bit frustrating after a while - it's not an easy game - but that's not a big problem. In fact, it may even be part of the fun, where's the fun in a game that's easy to beat?\nThe only bad thing is that it doesn't save itself automatically, even after you beat levels. You'll have to go to the menu, and save it there. There's slots for several saves, though, although I don't know if it's actually necessary.\nIn short, I recommend it for everyone.

The sequentailly generated ensure that you'll never have the same experience twice, even when you haven't changed anything. The use of 3d physics in a 2d puzzle game is truelly ground breaking and adds a level of imersion that other physics based puzzle games simply don't have. With it's intelegent level design and tasteful use of social commentary, Bad Rats has done to the physics puzzle games what Big Rigs Off Road Racing did for racing games, it has set a bar by which all other games in the genre will continue to be rated upon.","December 12, 2013","true","276.0"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

As a summary, this game is horrible. I paid 50 cents for this, just to see if it was as bad as everyone says. It was. It was all that and more. Nothing could have prepared me for this CATastrophy (pun) of a video game.\n\nMy first time booting up the game was something akin to a nightmare I once had as a child. Horrific, exaggerated, terrifying faces leapt out at me and performed confusing yet hostile actions. These rats look like a middle-schooler's first attempt at using Blender. And someone thought it was a good idea to have the game's intro be these rats moving around in shadows, doing…stuff. Just moving, or doing their ‘thing’ (baseball rats swings, arrow rat shoots an arrow). Their motions are jagged at best and their eyes are terrifyingly large. I can say, without a doubt in my mind, this game would have horrified me as a child. But that cat...holy ♥♥♥♥, man. The cat looks like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization between human and feline, an unholy abomination at best. Its face vaguely resembles human features, in an almost sickening way. You will not sleep tonight, my friend.\n\nAs I entered the menu, the one thing that became crystal clear (sarcastic pun) to me was the terrible sound. The soundtrack consists of the lamest 90s grunge rock/80s funk you've heard in your life, perhaps a foreshadowing of how 'edgy' the developers of this game thought they were. The sound effects from both the intro and the menu are painfully low-quality and seem to consist almost exclusively of Tom and Jerry rips/royalty-free audio clips. You can expect these consistently throughout all your gameplay. The menu itself is a confusing jumble of graffiti that leads to the levels, records, options, etc. However, on the left, the cat sits in a cage hanging from the ceiling, meowing pitifully and occasionally clasping his paws together, as if to beg for his life. He will consistently do this throughout the game, tugging at your heart strings (as a cat owner, I can say the noises the cat makes are, ironically, the most realistic of the game, and caused me a fair amount of anxiety. It sounds like a real cat in real pain, for the love of God) and making you wonder what he ever did to these psychopathic rats. The rats, meanwhile, are, in a seemingly randomized order, appearing on the screen and attacking the cat with their various ‘powers’. I say randomized because the rats often get in each other’s way and interact in glitchy ways. It’s just embarrassing to see such a poorly constructed menu. The menu itself is the best example I can give of why you should never play this game. Seeing it on Youtube should be enough for your morbid curiosity.\n\nFinally, the actual gameplay. Thankfully, it’s better than the menu, but not by much. The goal is to use various rats and props (boards, barrels, etc.) to move a ball through the labyrinth/really obvious path to the end where it’ll activate some instrument of torture and kill the cat. You’re given four levels of difficulty to choose from, two of which have a unique feature: showing you how to complete the level. I kid you not, after I selected difficulty ‘Easy’, every level had a neon green outline of not only the path the ball should take (which was always painfully obvious anyway), but even included small green circles where I should put the mice/objects. However, it never told you WHICH objects/mice to put WHERE, so you might think challenged me. NOPE. You see, I’d watched the video featured on the Steam page. This video literally shows the solutions to the first 6 or so puzzles. And, after those puzzles, when I encountered a level that wasn’t going to hold my hand all the way through, I quit because I simply didn’t care anymore. The incentive to play is so removed by the terrible presentation that the actually decent puzzle aspect is ruined. You’re supposed to want to try the levels over and over in different ways to get better scores, which seems more fun on the higher difficulties when you have all the rats at your disposal, but it just doesn’t happen. More rats doesn’t equal more fun, unfortunately. In addition, every level ends with you brutally murdering a helpless animal, the cat, who is chained at the end of the path, still meowing pitifully. I’m no PETA activist, but Christ, it’s just gross. The cat gets set on fire, squished, chain-sawed and MICROWAVED. Maybe I’m just sensitive, but seeing low-resolution blood and cat skulls flying everywhere isn’t how I want to spend any moment of my life. You can turn it off in the Options, but the fact that the developers thought this was a good premise to use for a game almost scares me. If they had just made the cat look evil, it would be bearable. But no, you’re gunna want to help this hideous cat and get him to safety, not end him. One final note: of the nine rats you’re given to utilize in the puzzles (baseball rat hits the ball forward, bulldozer rat pushes the ball forward, etc.) I have two issues. One, their unpredictability. How far they push/hit the ball or even what they do is impossible to initially judge. In addition, I came across several instances of what a rat did to the ball changing between attempts, regardless of the fact that I had not touched the rat at all. And two, the rats’ appearances and audio. The ‘bomber’ rat (a rat with a turban and beard, with dynamite strapped to its chest that occasionally bows) is, I think, some sort of a jab at suicide bombing in the Middle East and its very existence in the game disappointed me. All the rats have a singular phrase they repeat over and over and OVER, every 10 seconds or so. When stuck on a level, it can make an already obnoxious game unbearable.\n\nThere are, I’m sure, more things wrong with this game that resembles a failed game development project from a community college. I simply am not brave enough to start the game again and find them. Most bad games are playable enough that you can get a giggle from them, at the expense of their horrible execution. Bad Rats doesn’t even give you enough to get a smile out of it. Buy a packet of needles with the 5 bucks you saved by not buying this game and swallow them whole, one by one. You’ll have more fun that way.","January 13, 2014","false","0.3"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","1"

The rats are charismatic and make for good protagonists, and you can really feel the emotions between the cats and rats. This game has a great story, and it really made me think about humanity and religion. the engine makes good use of volumetric effects, light shafts, and is stunning. The gameplay plays like your average Incredible Machine type game, but injected with 100 shots of adrenaline. The game is fast paced and the jazzy music will keep your blood pumping and your head banging.\n\nThis is a masterpiece, and well worth 50 cents. 10/10","December 21, 2013","true","0.6"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","18","23","3","2"

Players who don't like this playing style, but generally want to play with the terrorrat will be happy to see that Bad Rats has a variety of different rats. If you want, for example, a rocketrat, it will be, of course, harder work than for a vaccumrat, but as much rewarding, because you will notice how your character truly evolves during Bad Rats. You have tons of options, tons of playing styles (which you can mix or even change at any point in the game if you feel like it).\nBut enough with characters. Other aspect which really felt unique and incredible was the size of the game. Not only Bad Rats itself is huge, considerably one of the biggest levels seen in a video game, but it's also fullfilled with things to do. I never went from one hold to another without finding plenty of puzzles, rats, cats into my way. And, if you're like me, you don't want to rush through the main story and prefer instead to explore more or do miscellaneous cat hunting, you'll be glad to take the side rats whenever you see them. The exploration never had an end for me, not even after so many hours spent into the game.\nYou are probably curious about the cat system. While technically not one of the best I have seen in a Rat game, I must admit that it had massively been improved since The game launch. The ''Luck'' factor is not present any more, so you can't miss a shot when you clearly were very close to the cat. The third person camera is now immersive, with tons of new animations and a new feature which I like a lot: the ratcam.\nOne final aspect I'd like to talk about is the length of the game. While the main storyline is relatively short (took me around 10 hours on hardest difficulty), the side cat destroying levels and rat quests make this game incredibly long. If you get Bad rats and plan on beating every single level, clearing every cat, finding every way to kill the cat, you'd better get prepared for a very, VERY long journey. I myself haven't completed a quarter of the entire game yet (checked progress with a mod).\nThis game is by far my favorite Rat game at the time being, its biggest rival in my opinion being Hello Kitty: The game.\nPros: + incredibly large levels, mixing bioms from brick walls to imersive indoor walls.\n+ a lot of locations, free for player to explore; hundreds of rat holes, which at their turn are themselves long and filled with cats, puzzles, traps which will reward handsomely the player at the end;\n+ plenty of cat hunting, most of which don't require the player to have completed the main questline;\n+ the introduction of cats as enemies, for the first time in the bad rats game;\n+ residents of bad rats all have their own lives and families. In the morning, they will leave their cat hunting and go to their job, in the afternoon they will take a break for eating, and in the evening they will close their shop and go back to their home or at the inn for some mead, where after a few hours will go to sleep;\n+ random encounters will let the rat find more about the game; fugitives will tell you to keep their stolen rats for a short while, followed by a scene where the owner finds you and asks you whether you have seen the thief (at this point, you can lie, you can tell him where the thief went, or you can be most honest and give him his rat); couriers will once in a while give the corespondence to you, which can lead to impressive new cat killing or will update your levels with new rats.\n+ the leveling system has been improved since Its launch: after you have a high level, you will no longer see ALL cats with the same killing animation, instead you will continue to find better and bigger cat killing animations;\n+ rats can buy home in 5 holds, where he can place his cat bodies, take his wife and kids and take a rest; this, personally, felt like a huge immersive feature in the bad rats\n+ you feel that your rat truly evolves as you progress; more over, you can make what you want of your rat: a good terrorrat, archerrat, smokingrat, etc., by using your skills;\nCons: - interface is worse than at launch; you can't sort items by criterias (feature that had been available in Hello Kitty: The game), you can't search for a specific item when you have plenty of rats in your inventory, and the aspect is generally bad; thus i recommend using a mod that changes inventory;\n- while reasonable, the game is filled with bugs, some of which can even break a level; again, i recommend using the Unofficial Patches;\n- some textures and meshes haven't been vigurously worked by developers and they look bad for 2009;\n\nPersonal rating: 95/100","June 2, 2015","true","110.8"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","15","18","8","0"

I graciously accepted and softly clicked the install button and within a few short minutes my brand new game was ready to play.\n\nI had no idea I was in for such a magnificent experience.\n\nThe expression on my face had almost instantly turned from neutrality to excitement when presented with the title screen. Gorgeous, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic, tantilizing graphics were displayed as the title screen shot across my monitor. Within a few short minutes I was already sent into the game, guns blazing. My glee only grew as I scoured level to level, astounded by the absolutely spectacular physics engine and mature, adult-like gore portrayed. The anger I had pent up in me for my microscopic chode quickly faded as I watched the eyes bulge and explode out of the sockets of a cartoon cat. As I finally finished up on the last level, tears formed in my eyes, so dismayed at the thought of leaving this game behind after 72 hours of gameplay equal to the finest intercourse with Martha Stewart. The sight of that final cat behind beheaded by the spinning blade of destruction caused me to scream out in ecstasy. My chode rose to a half-chub and I couldn't help but slide my hands around my shaft and aim at the moniter as a liquid ton of ♥♥♥♥♥ pulsated from my member's head. Once finished, I began to weep as I shut my computer off and walked to the nearest lake.\n\nAs I type this I am tying a rope around my entire computer, and attaching the other end to myself, at the neck. I will walk to the end of the dock, and throw the computer in. This will, in turn, pull me in with it and I will drown and I will die. I finished Bad Rats: the Rats Revenge and I feel that my life is also finished. As I lost all my friends and family simply by playing the game, my death will go unnoticed. I want to thank the creators of this game for teaching me what sex feels like.\n\nI give this game a ten, out of five.\n\nGoodbye, world. And goodbye Bad Rats. I expect a copy of the sequel for myself and my old acquaintance Buddha, as UI have now reached Nirvana.\n","July 12, 2015","true","1.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","12","13","6","0"

The physics simulation operates in 3D, despite the gameplay taking place in 2D.  This is a sign of poor use of the game engine, but it would probably be okay, if not for #2.\n\n2. There is a randomness effect to the physics simulation.  This means that repeating the same setup might not even produce the same result.\n\nThis basically means it fails the whole point of being a physics puzzle game -- unless what you want is something stupidly wacky that just does unexpected stuff.\n\nBut even as a late-night drunken sandbox game, it is too frustrating to be fun, as you're given very few tools with which to work each level.  So it's hard to come up with interesting alternative solutions.\n\n(Disclosure: Someone gifted this game to me.)","January 30, 2015","false","1.9"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","23","34","0","4"

She was pretty cute and I would've asked her out if what happened didn't happen. One day during lunch while I was eating my bento ( brunch for you uncultured swines ) she came up to me and started talking to me. At this point I didn't know what to say. I had rice in my mouth so I couldn't say anything. I swallowed it quickly and engaged into some social linking. She seemed eager to know more and more about me.\n\nThere was a brief pause when she finished talking about how her last boyfriend went and asked me, "Do you want to come play videogames with me."\n\nI agreed and I went to her house that evening. She invited me into her room. It was a girly room with no sign of video games around. She didn't even have a PC. Just a laptop sitting on her bed. She jumped onto her bed and patted a spot next to her for me to sit. I sat there and she opened up her laptop. I watched as she elegantly moved the mouse over to launch Steam. After logging in, she hovered over to her steam inventory that displayed one giftable game: Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge. She asked me what was my Steam name. I told her it. She then gifted me the game. She slid over the laptop to me so I could play it for a while. I logged in and installed it quickly. I ended up trying 10 minutes of it, but got too frustrated on how terrible the game was designed and how simple the idea was.\n\nAfter a while, I looked up and realized the the girl changed into a skimpy outfit. This was freaky, she then went to her door and attached a padlock onto it.\n\n"What are you doing?" I asked.\n\n"Hehe..." She giggled. "You'll never get out until you beat Bad Rats."\n\nI noticed that because my legs were asleep the entire time I was playing, she could tie them to the bed so I couldn't run away. This was bad, the only thing I could do was beat the game. I mean, she could've called the cops and reported me for ♥♥♥♥. So that's what I did. I played a non-stop 30 hour marathon of Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge. She would spoon feed me every other hour. It was kinda hot. I mean temperature wise. She holding onto me after I realized that she somehow took off my shirt. It was somewhat strange. Sweat poured down my back as I retried the first level for the 20th time. She would whip me every time I restarted. I lost count of how many times I got whipped. It was painful, and the game kept getting harder for some reason. The music was on fully blast and if I changed it, she would proceed to dial 911.\n\nAfter my 160th attempt, I finally beat the game because of some insane glitch I couldn't go into depth of explaining. She fell asleep by the time I beat it so I thought it was a great chance to sneak out. I smashed the laptop against my knee, breaking it in half and damaging my knee at the same time. I then proceeded to use the broken shards that fell out to cut the ropes binding my leg. I then through the laptop through the window to break it open and snuck out.\n\nI called the police after that, and they found her in her room still asleep with a whip in her hands. I showed them the marks on my back and they arrested her. I never heard from her again.\n\nAnd that's why I have 30 hours racked up on Bad Rats.","May 22, 2014","true","36.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","1"

I remember my first time when granny did this to me. It was september 11, 2001 and i was ready to eat some cookies. Granny pull the out of the oven all hot and creamy. I just stared at them and immediately grab one of them.  Little did I know grandma’s cookies were filled with a gallon of tabasco sauce and gave me explosive diarrhea. So I ran to the twin towers to find a bathroom, but my bowels exploded and many lives were lost due to grandmas fantastic cooking. To this day I’m still so embarrassed about the incident that people still think terrorists or the government caused the world trade center collapse.\nNope. It was me. Me and my sexy as ♥♥♥♥ grandma. We killed all those jews that day. But this isn’t about coverage of gay ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shit that happened 13 years ago, that ♥♥♥♥♥ for ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Instead I’m going to teach you how to put this hunk of ♥♥♥♥♥ up my ♥♥♥ just the right way.\nFirst you gotta lick my colon till brown trickles out. Even if it takes hours just do it. Then when that happens keep on licking, until you hear the festive farts plummeting out my turd launcher.\nThen Brenda’s ♥♥♥♥ got fisted and her butt got ♥♥♥♥ed and her ♥♥♥ got clocked and her booty got bucked. This made me very horney and just had to dive in raw. I had no other choice, but her luscious ♥♥♥ with the hair tied up took over me. It tied me up with no way out. All I can do is be patient. Hours and even days came and went when Brenda finally had to ♥♥♥♥. When she did I finally escaped and ran like a mexican on the border.\nThen my dog came up and sniffed my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with his nose. i let him do that for a while. and that was that.\nI was in kindergarden when I met a girl named Sheepa. Sheepa had a powdered face and some sweet powdered cranberry milk milf ♥♥♥♥ (just like grandma). I wondered why she had this so I asked. She responded “So I won’t sweat”. I thought how can I make her sweat. I checked out her body and I saw the only place that is wet. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥. So I grabbed it. She screamed, but I held on. She yelled ♥♥♥♥ like 10 times. All I could think of was trying to make her sweat. Finally when I inserted my ding dong into her hole I saw a drop of sweat coming down her face. This was the moment, my destiny. I pulled down her pants and made a quick decision if I should live in here or leave. It has been 10 years since I've been in her. She died 3 weeks ago and I’m not sure how much longer I can stay in her freezing cold body without cumming.\nThe reason she died was because she ♥♥♥♥ed up pouring my coffee.\nSo I did what any logical adult male would do, I expressed my emotions “YOU ♥♥♥♥IN ♥♥♥♥♥” and smashed the coffee pot over her head until she stopped breathing. It was so hot I’m surprised I didn’t bust my saucy ♥♥♥♥♥ fajita in her ripe ♥♥♥♥ right then and there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njust to be clear, we've written over a page of material which probably equates to the length of your assignment without even writing a word of anything of use","January 25","true","1.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","92","11","12","10","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobthejanitor/recommended/34900/","bobthejanitor","BobTheJanitor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobthejanitor/","1902 products in account",""For twelve years, you have been asking: Who is John Galt? This is John Galt speaking. I am the man who loves his life. I am the man who does not sacrifice his love or his values. I am the man who has deprived you of victims and thus has destroyed your world, and if you wish to know why you are perishing-you who dread knowledge-I am the man who will now tell you." The chief engineer was the only one able to move; he ran to a television set and struggled frantically with its dials. But the screen remained empty; the speaker had not chosen to be seen. Only his voice filled the airways of the country-of the world, thought the chief engineer-sounding as if he were speaking here, in this room, not to a group, but to one man; it was not the tone of addressing a meeting, but the tone of addressing a mind.\n\n"You have heard it said that this is an age of moral crisis. You have said it yourself, half in fear, half in hope that the words had no meaning. You have cried that man's sins are destroying the world and you have cursed human nature for its unwillingness to practice the virtues you demanded. Since virtue, to you, consists of sacrifice, you have demanded more sacrifices at every successive disaster. In the name of a return to morality, you have sacrificed all those evils which you held as the cause of your plight. You have sacrificed justice to mercy. You have sacrificed independence to unity. You have sacrificed reason to faith. You have sacrificed wealth to need. You have sacrificed self-esteem to self-denial. You have sacrificed happiness to duty.\n\n"You have destroyed all that which you held to be evil and achieved all that which you held to be good. Why, then, do you shrink in horror from the sight of the world around you? That world is not the product of your sins, it is the product and the image of your virtues. It is your moral ideal brought into reality in its full and final perfection. You have fought for it, you have dreamed of it, and you have wished it, and I-I am the man who has granted you your wish.\n\n"Your ideal had an implacable enemy, which your code of morality was designed to destroy. I have withdrawn that enemy. I have taken it out of your way and out of your reach. I have removed the source of all those evils you were sacrificing one by one. I have ended your battle. I have stopped your motor. I have deprived your world of man's mind.\n\n"Men do not live by the mind, you say? I have withdrawn those who do. The mind is impotent, you say? I have withdrawn those whose mind isn't. There are values higher than the mind, you say? I have withdrawn those for whom there aren't.\n\n"While you were dragging to your sacrificial altars the men of justice, of independence, of reason, of wealth, of self-esteem-I beat you to it, I reached them first. I told them the nature of the game you were playing and the nature of that moral code of yours, which they had been too innocently generous to grasp. I showed them the way to live by another morality-mine. It is mine that they chose to follow.\n\n"All the men who have vanished, the men you hated, yet dreaded to lose, it is I who have taken them away from you. Do not attempt to find us. We do not choose to be found. Do not cry that it is our duty to serve you. We do not recognize such duty. Do not cry that you need us. We do not consider need a claim. Do not cry that you own us. You don't. Do not beg us to return. We are on strike, we, the men of the mind.\n\n"We are on strike against self-immolation. We are on strike against the creed of unearned rewards and unrewarded duties. We are on strike against the dogma that the pursuit of one's happiness is evil. We are on strike against the doctrine that life is guilt.\n\n"There is a difference between our strike and all those you've practiced for centuries: our strike consists, not of making demands, but of granting them. We are evil, according to your morality. We have chosen not to harm you any longer. We are useless, according to your economics. We have chosen not to exploit you any longer. We are dangerous and to be shackled, according to your politics. We have chosen not to endanger you, nor to wear the shackles any longer. We are only an illusion, according to your philosophy. We have chosen not to blind you any longer and have left you free to face reality-the reality you wanted, the world as you see it now, a world without mind.\n\n"We have granted you everything you demanded of us, we who had always been the givers, but have only now understood it. We have no demands to present to you, no terms to bargain about, no compromise to reach. You have nothing to offer us. We do not need you.\n\n"Are you now crying: No, this was not what you wanted? A mindless world of ruins was not your goal? You did not want us to leave you? You moral cannibals, I know that you've always known what it was that you wanted. But your game is up, because now we know it, too.\n\n"Through centuries of scourges and disasters, brought about by your code of morality, you have cried that your code had been broken, that the scourges were punishment for breaking it, that men were too weak and too selfish to spill all the blood it required. You damned man, you damned existence, you damned this earth, but never dared to question your code. Your victims took the blame and struggled on, with your curses as reward for their martyrdom-while you went on crying that your code was noble, but human nature was not good enough to practice it. And no one rose to ask the question: Good?-by what standard?\n\n"You wanted to know John Galt's identity. I am the man who has asked that question.\n\n"Yes, this is an age of moral crisis. Yes, you are bearing punishment for your evil. But it is not man who is now on trial and it is not human nature that will take the blame. It is your moral code that's through, this time. Your moral code has reached its climax, the blind alley at the end of its course. And if you wish to go on living, what you now need is not to return to morality-you who have never known any-but to discover it.\n\n"You have heard no concepts of morality but the mystical or the social. You have been taught that morality is a code of behavior imposed on you by whim, the whim of a supernatural power or the whim of society, to serve God's purpose or your neighbor's welfare, to please an authority beyond the grave or else next door-but not to serve your life or pleasure. Your pleasure, you have been taught, is to be found in immorality, your interests would best be served by evil, and any moral code must be designed not for you, but against you, not to further your life, but to drain it.\n\n"For centuries, the battle of morality was fought between those who claimed that your life belongs to God and those who claimed that it belongs to your neighbors-between those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for the sake of ghosts in heaven and those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for the sake of incompetents on earth. And no one came to say that your life belongs to you and that the good is to live it.\n\n"Both sides agreed that morality demands the surrender of your self-interest and of your mind, that the moral and the practical are opposites, that morality is not the province of reason, but the province of faith and force. Both sides agreed that no rational morality is possible, that there is no right or wrong in reason-that in reason there's no reason to be moral.\n\n"Whatever else they fought about, it was against man's mind that all your moralists have stood united. It was man's mind that all their schemes and systems were intended to despoil and destroy. Now choose to perish or to learn that the anti-mind is the anti-life.\n\n"Man's mind is his basic tool of survival. Life is given to him, survival is not. His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its content is not. To remain alive, he must act, and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action.","March 31, 2014","true","10.7"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericmeh/recommended/34900/","ericmeh","Eric","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericmeh/","162 products in account","Ok so the game is bad. The physics are different each attempt, some how. The music is awful and it takes some time to get it turned off. The sound effects are also bad enough to turn off. There is no story. The replayability will, I'm sure, be non-existant. However, this isn't so bad as to warrant a negative review.\n\nBad (sorta): You see, the physics being different every single attempt adds an artificial difficulty to the puzzles, so that the game isn't just a roll over. The 10th try around, you'll begin to doubt your setup. And when it finally comes together properly, you're free of that hell until you click "Next." It's a good feeling.\n\nBad (sorta): The music and sound in general are bad enough to turn off, but you can technically disable it, and it stops if you alt tab out of the game. So thank you for that. Put on some chill toons on Pandora or Spotify, and just enjoy that.\n\nBad (sorta): The gameplay is "this item can move the ball in the X direction." "This item can move the ball in the Y direction." (X and Y because it is purely 2D "puzzles".) I mean, google "physicsgames" and you will get the same.\n\nBad (sorta): The funky physics variations makes the game seem to go on forever, which is, best-case scenario purgatory. But the game seems to last long enough to get your card drops. And at $.19, the cards are worth more than the game itself.\n\nBad: Production. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=359733425\n\nGood: The cards are worth more than the game itself.\n\nGood: You'll spend time writing a review with the game open so you can get your damn cards without having to play. I said there was enough gameplay to stretch it for the card drops, but tabbing back is an unattractive prospect at the moment.\n\nBad: I would actually recommend it for kids if the physics didn't change so much. I'm sure 8 year old me would probably enjoy the art style (which I'm neutral on because that's not my area to criticize) and violent results (I'm not a psychopath, really). But since the physics are different each time, there's nothing here worth teaching children. You'll have to explain to them why their solution works one in ten times despite nothing else changing.\n\n\nSo why do I give it a thumbs up? Because Bad Rats isn't as bad as most people make it out to be. Yeah it sucks, but it doesn't suck the soul out of you and ♥♥♥♥ it down the drain.\n\nBad: The game doesn't auto save. I quit to menu at around level 16 or 17, and "continue game" didn't have my save file. I'm not mad that I lost my progress, but I'm certainly not going to look into it in order to play the game. I'll just idle out my remaining card. What a huge ♥♥♥♥ing oversight.\n\nI actually changed my yes to a no.","December 21, 2014","false","2.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

Use a variety of objects and tools from planks of wood to terrorist rats to reach your goal. The storyline of this game is downright outstanding, it truley shines in the market of todays games.

Its inutive design and variation of both easy and tough was challenging to the point where i was forced to both tactically and strategically rethink my actions in the continuation of the game.\nThrough all this you really started to get this feeling for all the characters in the game as they were all easy to relate to our own time and society. Each with their own personality and unique character.\nAs to the story this was just pure gold, and will probabaly be remmebered through Video game as pure art and defenition of a game deserving a Game Of the Year award.\nAs this review draws to a close, and my indiction to return to playing bad rats I can personally say this is pure gold on the steam website. for only 0.99 I would rather pay 99.0$ for this if I could and help these superb developers in any way i could.\nI am eagerly anticipating the next sequel to the Bad Rats which will hopefully, with these capable developers, be a successful franchise and bring us a next generation of RPG´s, FPS, and gameplay never seen on any platform before.\n1/10 a masterpiece","November 5, 2014","true","0.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","13","16","6","5"

I don't mean to spoil anything, but I really have to say that the suicide bomber rat's death touched me in a way that no other game has.\n\nThe graphics are admittedly a little dated now. But the art direction is unique and stylized enough for make up for it; it immerses you in the world of the rats.\n\nThe puzzles themselves start off simple enough, but still require some thought. Even after hours of playing experience, you can never be sure of the result of your new ingenious ratty setup! Best of all, Bad Rats doesn't constrain itself to the shackles of determinism like most modern games. The same setup can have wildly different results (a metaphor for life, perhaps?).\n\nRealistically, anyone who hasn't played Bad Rats can't truthfully call themselves a complete human being. It's more than a game. It's an experience. An experience that I can guarantee will change your life forever. Change it for the better? That, I cannot say for sure. The only way to find out is to begin your journey toward the rank of Rat King, and pray that you make it through alive.","July 31, 2015","true","1.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","14","18","7","0"

It doesn't matter how cheep it was or how cheep it comes , it will always feel as if you payed to much. And it is true! You will pay. With your soul.\n\nI could up-vote this game like the trolls who give fake reviews, but that's just not me. I always try to let my inner freak out in the reviews when I like something and I especially won't hold back when I hate something like this little piece of pain. I don't get paid, so I don't fear consequences and I don't like cats that much that it would interfere.\n\nThis game comes from "Invent4 Entertainment" and publishers with the name "Strategy First". How dares someone to have that name and than release a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game like this one? It feels as if this game was abandoned in alpha develop and someone desperately tried to make money with it anyway. The physics should be the mayor deal when you need them to fulfill the goal of a game. Every time I failed and the cat started laughing, it felt as if the developers would laugh about me having paid for this crap.\n\nIn this physic-game is no physic. You might think it is bad, but it is worse. You got 30 tries per level, so they must know that it is not working correctly. It would even show you the genius plan in the first place and it still won't work. There is not even logic in his game. In one of the first levels you would need to let a ball hit a shotgun to win. The shotgun would fall, get of and kill the cat. You could also place a rat with an baseball bat next to the shotgun and... well... no. I get it, they don't want to kill the cat, you do. The rats only wan't to play some ball, but at least the game could refuse the rat-placement next to the gun than.\n\nNow let's talk about the concept here: Rats kill cats. Sounds okay. That was it. Don't expect an story, any kind of background or even an intro. There is an start menu and the first level is a tutorial. Minimalism can be great, but there is this alpha-feeling again.\n\nLet us judge the graphics now. I am not the biggest fan of high def graphics. When I like a game, I don't even care if it looks like 8 Bit or just not like newest standards. This game looks like an game that I played 17 years ago and it was an game to promote content for the sexindustry, running on windows 95 and so low even back in days because it was mostly just a joke to sell better. I ask myself if this is a joke?!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hotdogbitchface/recommended/34900/","Hotdogbitchface","Hotdog Bitchface","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hotdogbitchface/","2391 products in account","NOTE: This is a slightly shortened version of my review without screenshots. For the full review, please visit  Real Gamer Reviews[realgamerreviews.com]\n\nThe worst thing about this game, by far, is the overabundance of sarcastic reviews littered all over Steam from second-rate wannabe comedians. Please, guys. The joke is old. It's done. It's been made before. Please, let it go.\n\nAs for the game itself, my feelings are mixed. Make no doubt about it - the game is flawed. Very flawed. Overall I'd give it a 3.5/10. It had some potential but is very, very rough around the edges.\n\nFirst things first - the gameplay. The gameplay will be very familiar to people that grew up playing The Incredible Machine. Also, to a lesser extent, it reminds me of Lemmings. You play as the rats, and the ultimate goal is to brutally murder the cat on each level by manipulating a ball. You get access to a number of different rats, depending on the level. Archer rat will shoot the ball straight ahead, vaccuum rat will suck the ball upwards, tractor rat will move the ball slowly forward, etc. You also get access to a few props per level, such as crates, wooden planks, balloons, etc. Once again, this will all be very familiar to The Incredible Machines veterans.\n\nSo what's the issue then, you ask? Firstly, probably the most game-breaking issue is the fact that the physics are inconsistent. You can position everything right, but when you press "play", things can still go wrong. Then you can try pressing play again 6 times and 6 different things will happen, even though you haven't moved any of your objects/rats. This is made even stupider by the fact that at the end of each level, you're able to view the "Original solution" (by the developers, presumably), and when you hit "play" on those, a good 50% or more will fail on the first try. Ultimately, it means that each time you create a setup for a level, you should hit play multiple times before changing anything. It's... silly. A game so reliant on physics should not have its physics randomised in this way.\n\nThe second gameplay issue is that a lot of the things in the game are clunky. With the wooden ramp, for example, the game tries to angle it at an "ideal" angle depending on where you put it, but this so-called ideal angle often isn't the angle you want it at, and it's incredibly frustrating to try to lie a wooden plank flat when the game decides it wants to be at a 45 degree angle.\n\nThe third issue with the game itself is that it's the most unstable thing I've ever played in my life. I've played for a little over an hour and have had the game semi-crash on me 6 times. I say semi-crash, because it doesn't actually kill the game per se, nor does it freeze. Instead, it keeps me in the game but doesn't let me click on anything or scroll anywhere. It's possible that I've actually pressed something accidentally to cause this, so if anyone has any insight on it, please let me know. The issue is worsened by the fact that there is no autosave in this game - a fairly large oversight, given how much sense it would have made to have the game autosave at the end of each level. Fortunately, the game does have a password system which allows you to choose the level you want, most of which you can find online in case you, like me,  cannot for the life of you bring yourself to write down a password for each level.\n\nThe visuals for the game are... objectively poor. Steam claims the game was released in 2009, but honestly it looks quite bad for a game that was released 10 years before that. Furthermore, the resolutions available are 800x, 1024x and 1240x, all of which look like crap and all of which will leave huge black bars covering approximately 20% of your screen on each side of the screen. The art style is very reminiscent of terrible 90's games, which although objectively looks awful, is kind of my thing, predominantly for nostalgic reasons.\n\nThe music for the game is probably one of the few redeeming factors. It's actually pretty catchy and suitable considering how terrible most things about the game are.\n\nOverall, I'd say the game definitely has a large number of flaws, most of which could have been fixed but never were and are unlikely ever to be. It's a shame, really, because despite all its flaws, I actually found myself enjoying what I did play of the game. In other words, I had a better time playing it than I did with some other games that were received a lot more warmly.\n\nWould I recommend it? I'd have to say no, for the most part. Yes, the game is cheap at 99c and often goes on special for 20c and drops trading cards. With that said, on Steam, we are spoiled for choice - Game bundles are rampant everywhere and the main limiting factor for most people now is time, rather than money. As a result, although I'd recommend this game in a vaccuum for 20 cents, I can't honestly say that it's worth anyone's time. For people looking for this style of game, I think that games such as Crazy Machines will provide a considerably better experience.","November 6, 2014","false","8.8"," 134 of 243 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","134","243","0","20"

You poor misguided people, put down whatever game you've been playing and go to the true GOTY of every year ever. the game I am talking about is Bad Rats. With a heart-wrenching story about the terrible battle between cats and vermin, you play as a team of wily, interesting rats with a wide set of skills and personalities. Using interpretive logic, solve intricate puzzles using the developer's "inconsistent physics engine" which means that any given scenario can have as many as 5,000,000 outcomes, due to a huge database of random-number generators. Sometimes, the developer-given solutions will fail, giving the player a feeling of empowerment as they are forced to solve the puzzle themselves. The graphics, which appear 2.5D (a platformer rendered in a 3D world) the game is actually fully rendered in 3 dimensions. Sometimes, the ball (your puzzle-solving mechanic) will move along the z-axis, making it untouchable by your incredible band of rats. The heart-pounding action of pressing the "reset" button and waiting to see the outcome was almost too much for me to bear. In the end, I was forced to quit the game early, as the intense graphics burned out my computer (64 gigs of ram) as the game takes up processing room like Far Cry: 3 on Ultra * Sniper Elite: 3 on Authentic - Half Life 3 on Easy. Needless to say, the graphical input was too much for my mortal mind, and I now have lost sensees in my right eye and both ears. I think anyone who has not tried this game is missing the best thing in this world, and possibly in the next. God himself is a dim blink compared to the shining star of Bad Rats.\n\n100/10","July 14, 2014","true","0.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

And there are bad games. Not every game is good. Not every game can be enjoyable. Sometimes things just don't work out. Sometimes the people behind it mess up. Sometimes there are people in suits, bad people, that force everyone to make it ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Sometimes the people making it have a disorder, where they refuse to let anyone interfere with their vision. But their vision was caused by having no friends as a kid, and their intense Oedipus complex due to never getting laid even though they're in their 30's. Yup, some games just never work out.\n\n\nBad Rats is that kind of game. It's clear that there was some kind of vision there. But not the clearest vision. Whoever thought this up might've been staring into the sun for too long. Or tried to make lemonade but used salt instead of sugar, and then got waterboarded with that.\n\n\nAn interesting little, uh... happening. Bad Rats is a wonky little PC physics game, and a legend on Steam. Bad Rats has transcended regular games. This is a full-blooded, full-bodied meme. This is a meme. You're being memed. We're all being memed on. Worshiped as a god among memes, Bad Rats goes where no meme has gone before. Into your wallet. Unless you buy meme shirts from Hot Topic but if that's the case I'm afraid you're beyond saving already.\n\n\nBad Rats isn't actually THAT bad of a game. It's a mediocre physics puzzle game. Use the various random junk to build a little Rube Goldberg-esque machine to kill a cat. Simple premise. Not exactly executed well, of course. But I mean, they had their heart in the right place. You got brutally ♥♥♥♥♥ by a group of guys. They yanked you out of your car and, you know, went at it. No one listened to your cries for help. You're pregnant with their child now and are haunted by options, thoughts of aborting your child, raising your ♥♥♥♥♥♥'s child, or just emptying out your medicine cabinet to fill the emptiness you feel inside you... And then Bad Rats comes along with a little "It's a Boy!" balloon and a card with 5 dollars in it. Maybe some gas station coffee. They tried to cheer you up. They were trying.\n\n\nBad Rats is plagued by a number of issues. Uninspired puzzles, inconsistent and weird physics, and its inexplicable... style.\n\n\nThere's something genuinely uncomfortable about the game. The awkward animations and graphics look somewhere between an amateur school project a kid in a 3D modeling class made, a foreign low-budget animated film, and low-quality 3D modeled porn.\n\n\nThe animations are clunky, the game's poorly executed gore really just makes you cringe, and the general atmosphere is like that of a swingers club for the mentally disabled. The first time I knocked a safe onto a cat and saw its little orange blob of a body implode and shoot blood and internal bits everywhere, I felt dirty and uncomfortable. Like I'd accidentally downloaded snuff porn or something and watched it in front of my mom. It wasn't really funny in that over-the-top gore kind of way. It wasn't super satisfying. It wasn't even horrifyingly grotesque like a Mortal Kombat fatality. It was like cracking your little brother over the head with a metal folding chair, like they do on TV. But then he doesn't wake back up. The game is just completely tone deaf.\n\n\nFor a lot of people, this game would be a waste of a dollar. For a lot of people. Not everyone though. Not everyone has a sense of shame. Of indecency. They'll sleep with a hooker and dump her right on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere, fully knowing it was their teenage cousin trying to pay off her art school loans.\n\n\nIt's like a really bad car wreck. Some people will drive right past, keeping their eyes on the road. Most will slow down, just to get a good look. They want their fill of human dismemberment before speeding away. But some people will drive even slower, polishing their knob furiously as they see limbs strewn about. They salivate with lust at the corpse of what may be a guy or girl, it's indistinguishable right now, impaled by sharp metal pieces. They didn't go painlessly. They're disfigured horribly, their bones cracked and crunched up, protruding from their skin. But these people will drive by real slow, waving to the police as they drool all over the wreckage. This is what they live for.\n\n\nBad Rats is not the right game for a lot of people. You might figure it's not bad for a dollar. You might give it a chance. But you will regret it. When you're at the gates of the beyond, throwing open their mighty golden doors only to be greeted with emptiness and darkness, that is what Bad Rats is. The realization that life is empty and unfair. That even death cannot save you from a life of futile struggling, for the torment will follow you into the nothingness of the void.\n\n\nOnly those truly sick, those who've looked eternal suffering in the face and giggled with glee, only they will revel in this cluster♥♥♥♥ of mangled limbs and broken souls. Memes, they'll say. You've all been memed. They'll buy you ten copies of the game as a gift, and laugh hysterically. It's all a game to them. They'll look you in the eye as you boot it up, climaxing as a bitter cold consumes your very being. The inner light within you, extinguished.\n\n\nI could warn you to stay away, but really it's no use. You'll find yourself in possession of Bad Rats one way or another. Like rats carrying bubonic plague, gnawing at the corpses of all you love and hold dear, scurrying through your home, through your vents, crawling under your bed and between your sheets as you sleep.\n\n\nThere's no escape from the pain. They will nibble away at you for eternity, even in death. There's no escape.","January 14","false","3.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","12","16","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsunari96/recommended/34900/","tsunari96","Tsunari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsunari96/","80 products in account","I highly doubt that this game requires any further discussion in regards to the gameplay and appeal--instead, this game has a contrasting value of what it means to have, not what it means to play and by means in particular to Steam community.\n\n"Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."\n--Julius Robert Oppenheimer, quoting Bhagavad Gita\nThe game itself is a mere part of the Steam store which is already saturated by far more playable and valuable games that people are actually appreciating to have downloaded, played and reviewed on it. At the very bottom of this meticulous spire of gaming industry within Steam, Bad Rats is at the lowest part of the chain, including both in quality and price. What is interesting, however, is its comparison from others within the same pit of fate, such as Def Gravity, Gearcrak Arena, etc. Curiously enough, one has comprised of reviews that mark its incompleteness, though it does argue that game didn't put much effort to expand beyond its generic concept. The other one was known for cheapest game in the Steam store, marked mainly as "made to be cheap." Bad Rats on the other hand is in stuck between--its crude quality and blunt effort made into the game keeps this game's value in between being poorly made and best at its value--It's just absolutely BAD. Is there a mystery to it? To answer your question, assuming your eyes aren't sore already after my first sentence, this game is a monumental symbol of where it is at--to take this seriously is up to how you perceive my opinion below.\n\nBad Rats is arguably one of those memetic infectious existence being in our game library. Aside from that guy who bought the Bad Rats first before others, we simply didn't buy the game because we bought it for what games usually are consumed as--for fun. Probably the main reason why it sits at your game library is because:\n\n1. You heard about it and you want to know about it.\n\n2. Your friend gifted it to openly express that your friend hates you.\n\n3. You spent all your money on good game and the left over in your Steam Wallet can actually afford Bad Rats.\n\n4. Other reasons. (I don't know--fan of rats? fan of murdering cats in most sinister rendition?)\n\nAfter a careful thought, I have come to a conclusion that Bad Rats, if not already explicitly clear, represents the Plague of our realms in the gaming history. It is no easy matter that the video game history has reflected an interesting parallel reflection of what human race has endured. The quality control ever since the crash of video game market and grim turns of gaming industry has taken in nowadays is strangely similar. Where have these games sprouted in the Steam store and how they managed to root into our game library? For some reason, it is eerie to actually know why this game was made to exist in reality. However, one can assume that this is the creation by the human being and worst part of the reality is that anyone can make such cancerous being in the world--even that 5-year-old Tommy in your neighbourhood.\n\nLet's trace ourselves back to the grim time of Plague, where people simply died without explanation but only the sign of death. most historians would agree that the main reason why Plague deeply damaged the human population was due to lack of understanding how it was transferred and how to maintain hygiene to prevent the spread. Such mysterious yet deadly disease brought a great panic across the commonwealth, causing confusions and ultimately the fear of what it could do to a human being. It wasn't exactly the issue of death because death was inevitable--the only difference was to die happily or cursed. When the demonic black-red rings of death appeared on one's body, you could had only assume that the person was the sinner and has received its terminal punishment. In result the person would be damned by his friends, family and even the doctors and priests garnered in infamous crow masks.\n\nIn our game library, thing is little different than back in the middle age--our game library has been under control in lieu of our judgements, sometimes making foolish mistakes that we would regret. However, Steam store brought a prosperity to literally anyone's game library, even if you had no money to spend on any games. With its constant flow of new and old games easily discounted, our game library can easily grow into bloating collection of games yet to be installed or even be recognized. This easily develop-able habit of buying games on discounts, particularly in Steam sales, symbolizes the hardly-controllable growth of infectiously bad games. the numbers slashing across games' presenting values soften our grip on our wallets and easily be fooled into buying the game because it is on sale--such same devious illusion shapes poorly-developed early access games and falsely satisfying your desire of getting ahead of the hastely-expanding (or seemingly so) video game market via pre-orders.  Our senses are dulling and our judgements are loosen. It would be no big surprise that we're heading toward the second great video game market crash. Some may see this as hollow as the Mayan's 2012 Apocalypse while some take it as seriously as whatever the guy with big fat white beard said.\n\nBad Rats in such sense symbolizes our rustic taste of video games nowadays, taking the spoon into the depth of excrete flakes floating on the soup of urine. It is a fair warning that the developer of this game must had in mind, to become the epidemic death crawling within our steam library. I dare say that it is a volatile revolution against the undesirable direction that the video game industry had been indulging out of false satisfaction of gamers. (Press X to Continue)\nThe gameplay and the setting was mere way to present it as the game because what the game symbolizes does not require a weight to its presence--its true value, if not sole purpose, is to nest within our Steam library along with many other games that we have bought and carelessly thought if we were really going to play back in the time we bought it.\n\nThe overture of pandemic has just started--and what's really scary thing is that we're snickering and pointing fingers at the upcoming horror against what we love to play. When the chain on the bellowing beast's neck be broken? It is truly depressing statement to say that no one really knows where this is going. However, it is crystal clear that the Bad Rats catalysed the march of bad games once again after its predecessors.","January 2, 2015","false","2.4"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","15","22","4","6"

It stars a medley of perfectly constructed and beautifully written charactes such as Rex "Smoker" Rat, and Joey "Cannon" Rat. it is a story of brothers who were orphaned and left on the street by their abusive cat father, who later killed their mother in a shocking prequel level. The game centers around the conflict, and the desperate measures the rats have gone to, to survive. Joey turned to a circus job to get money, with his brother robin. Max turned to food to solve his problems, becoming grossly overweight. Francis and marie began doing odd jobs such as cleaning and farm work to make do as well. Rex began smoking and doing other drugs to ease the pain of taking care of so many younger brothers. one day he found the smallest brother, Brunswick, with several bombs strapped to himself in the street with their father. The abuse and harshness of the streets drove him to insanity, and he wanted to kill himself, but not before taking his father with him. the game ends darkly, with an explosion and Rex kneeling in the street, one eye missing to the shrapnel, unable to find strength to go on, he collapses and the screen fades, leaving us all questioning our own mortality.\n\n9/10 made me cry even more than CoD Ghosts when the dog almost died","July 4, 2014","true","2.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The game itself is actual perfection, I cannot find a single flaw in it. I would gladly have very rough sexual interactions with the creators of this game. Hell, I would pay money to let them have these rough interactions with me. But I digress, I would very much enjoy if the creators of this game would create DLC of some kind for this game. Just so that I can give them more of my money. Though until then, I'll just continue to give copies out to my friends to fill their pockets with my money.\nThe puzzles in this game are 10/10, I have avoided university due to the fact I am that confident in Bad Rats ability to educate me and keep my brain nice and fresh.\n\nIn short, no matter what who you buy this for, it is the perfect gift; your best friend, your online girlfriend, your dying grandmother or your dyslexic cousin, they will all come out of playing this game a better person.\nThank you Bad Rats, for completing my life.\nWithout you, I would be nothing.","July 2, 2014","true","46.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/allyosaugh/recommended/34900/","allyosaugh","Allyosaugh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/allyosaugh/","182 products in account","I have now played through Invent 4's artistic tour-de-force, 'Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge' three times. With each playthrough, 'Bad Rats' becomes more complexly entangled in and inseparable from my own life. I no longer know where Bad Rats ends and I begin.\n\nIt is, without question, the best game ever made. But this comment is in no way meant to be discouraging. Because while Bad Rats is the best game ever made it is also the easiest way to attain Lou Gehrig's disease. Simply put, 'Bad Rats' will change your life.\n\nIt's not just the phenomenal animmation or the fantastical gameplay or the stunning models or the musical score so soaked in post-modern existentialist dubstep remixes of popular 1990's children's cartoons that you will ♥♥♥♥ yourself in auditory delight or the Stevie Wonder-making 2d sprites; no, there is something so magically right with this game that it can only be the product of divine intervention. If you took the greatest game developers in history and gave them all the task of creating a film as magnificent as this, not one of them, with all their knowledge and skill, could make anything that could even be considered as a contender. Not one 24fps 900p rendered Ellen Page hair would rival any painstakingly hand-animated by third-world children pixel in Bad Rats.\n\nThe centerpiece of this eureka-inducing Tom Hanks spasm is the Fat Rat. Without it, this would still be the best game ever made, but with it Bad Rats is the greatest best most amazing lifestyle (not a game, mom) ever made. The Fat Rat has been described as a diabetic hippie, a Croatian velociraptor, possibly from Norway, clearly a product of Usimare Ramesses III and Alexander the Great's illigetimate love affair, or maybe even not from this world or dimension. All of these things are true at any one moment (except for the diabetes). It is a tantalizing mystery stuffed inside an enigma wrapped in fur and smothered in pixels. You will fall in love with this rat even as you are repelled by it from the first moment it steps into the game on level 4 with its wide John Candy style love handles and thick bulbous shoulders packed into an oddly fitting 40-polygon model, and its jagged .jpg destroyed texture. The Fat Rat looks out of place, out of time and out of this world. There has never been anything else like it. Nor will there ever be.\n\nPlay this game at all costs. Play it twice. Or three times. Or as one grizzled war veteran that I met from Milwaukee has, 12 times! See it until you can recite every precious level password this game masterpiece of modern art has to offer. Let Bad Rats become your new religion and the Fat Rat your prophet preaching the gospel according to Papa John.\n\nMy dream is to someday buy an arcade with machines that play nothing but Bad Rats 24 hours a day, 7 days a week until the nearby town disintegrates. I hope it becomes your dream as well.\n\nSent from my iPhone","June 26, 2014","true","72.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","2"

Bad Rats is a fantastic puzzle game. It provides many hours of entertainment. Sure the objective is simple, create a rube goldberg like machine while using the pre determined beams of the level to guide you to victory, but the challenge of the game kicks in. It uses quality, fun puzzles that challenge the mind, yet offer great rewards at the end of it by saying bye bye to cats. Reminds me of a more violent version of Tom and Jerry and we all know how great those classic cartoons were.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ooooooooga/recommended/34900/","ooooooooga","Kenny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ooooooooga/","70 products in account","A lot of people gifted me this game and, to be honest, I'm hooked. I believe it.\n\nBad Rats is probably one of the most imaginative and revoluationary steps the platforming genre has taken in a long time. Some have gone as far as to say it's a spiritual successor to Superman 64, but that's blatant trolling. Why make a pun as poor as that when the most broke ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ could shell out a dime to play 'Bad Rats' and enrich himself? The game, as of now, costs nineteen cents (Euro currency). The value is a million times worth more than your money.\n\nWhat, you can't run it? Technical issues are persistent if you have Windows Vista or earlier operating sysems, along with functional, user-friendly interfaces like Linux, but installing Windows 7 is worth it for Bad Rats. Honestly. You won't lose a bit of sleep over it, unless you dream about Linux, you f*ggot.\n\nI mean, the first aspect that hasn't received a lot of superlatives, for some ♥♥♥♥ing reason, is the art style. Think of anorexic Roland Rat with bucktooth, and his colleges don certain attire, items or boast physical attributes that constitute their defining features. The Lung Rat is a chain-smoker, most likely a metaphor for the health concerns (not celebrations) of smoking. (Celebrate it if you want, though, it's best to suspend reality in this game). Same with the vacuum rat, a metaphor for fourth-wave feminism and the role of the housewife in the Western world. There are Eastern implications, too; a bomber rat is featured in the game, a rodent who dons a suicide jacket, most likely satirizing Islamic terrorism. Several more rats exist, such as the Archer Rat, Fat Rat (Americans, pay attention), Homosexual Rat, Promiscuous Rat, Hippie Rat, Shitgoose Rat, Moosecock Rat and Happy Rat. The game is textured wonderfully, with memorable characters that make a deep, resounding impact once your ears are open. I believe it.\n\nPlot-wise, there isn't much to say. The game revolves around level-based objectives: you are to solve physics-based puzzles using objects and rats to take revenge on cats. The cat is the antagonist, although it's really up to the gamer to propel the story. Imagination isn't necessary, since this game attracts logical thinkers as well as visualists, but yeah. I believe it.\n\nThe gameplay is groundbreaking. I haven't had this much fun playing a platformer since Sonic the Hedgehog 3. I mean, don't get me wrong. Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is COMPLETELY dissimilar to this title. Same with Portal, even though I'm implying this game is the next step. Level-design happens to be one of the factors that changed the face of platform, which is why I'll never be able to look at Sonic the Hedgehog 3 or Portal 2 again. I believe it.\n\nSo, the objective of the game is to get the ball from point A to point B (B being the cat, even though a cat isn't called B and if you thought that, then you might as well be illegible) and making use of the rats. One of the unique things about Bad Rats is that it utilizes slopes. Yeah, you'd argue that Sonic had slopes. Portal even had slopes. But rats climb up slopes, and Sonic wasn't a rat, he was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hedgehog that you thought could run super fast. I digress since this is a pub argument, and not a topic worth mentioning in a professional review, but the one mechanic that Bad Rats is dependent on happened to innovate traditional structural platforming forever. And I believe it.\n\nAnd, plus, the game boldly incorporates violence as you make noble gameplay decisions such as making use of the exploding rats and rocket rats. I mean, it's really funny and all, but, yeah. I believe it.\n\nPlus, Bad Rats has nice music and all. Er, yeah. Not that I'm deaf or anything.\n\nAnd I can't really say there's anything wrong with it, otherwise the Metascore would be lower.\n\nRegardless? Outstanding. Can't believe I didn't come across Bad Rats any later. Bad Rats is a mesmirizingly smart, unique game that makes you feel really smart when you've finished playing it. Highly recommended for the retrospective, pro, underground and casual gamer scene. This is a title that'll age well.","June 19, 2015","true","1.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","71","12","17","9","0"

The mind blowing physics engine always keeps the levels interesting as you never quite know what will happen when you hit play, a true testament to the hyper realistic physics engine.\n\nSadly, there are two downsides to the game. Firstly, at only a few hours long the game doesn't last as long as anybody would hope and secondly, the sheer quality of the game makes it difficult to play other puzzle games. Once you've played Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge, there's just nothing that compares. Don't bother with the next-gen consoles this Christmas, do your self a favour and buy Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge and don't forget to gift all your friends a copy.

It cannot be described by simple words. It represents the power struggle between the lower classes of society, and those in control. It shows how the organized masses can generate a revolution, while, at the same time, exploring the concept of the revolutionaries becoming as bad (if not worse) than the dictators they managed to overthrow.\n\nAdd to that an exploration into the concept of chaos: how completely similar systems can lead to completely different results. Or is it a modern view on quantum mechanics? After all, the cat is both alive and dead, until the methaphorical box, in this game represented by your mechanism, "opens". It's also a path to exploring the nature of mind: we all know the "definition of insanity" that states it's "doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results", and yet that's what you'll find yourself doing in this game.\n\nThis game will change you.

Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City (although taped entirely in Los Angeles), the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, particularly best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). It is often described as being "a show about nothing", as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life.","June 5","true","12.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","6","6","5","0"

Believing it to be uninhabited, colonists began exploring the tunnels until one day, the colony suddenly vanished without a trace. News reporters who went to investigate never returned. After 6 days of fruitless searching, another colony disappeared, but this time, our protagonist caught sight of what must be the source of the colonies' disappearance: a huge army of bipedal cats armed with technology far beyond humanity's capability, able to turn humans into rats and alter the laws of physics to suit a cat-friendly environment.\n\nOur protagonist warned the other Martian colonies of the cats, but the warnings are met with intense laughter; no one believed that their pets could've possibly done such a thing. One by one, the colonies disappeared, and before the last one was attacked, our protagonist took a shuttle to Earth to try to warn of their impending doom.\n\nEarth's economy, which depended heavily on raw materials from Mars, collapsed soon after the last colony disappeared, plunging Earth into chaos. Widespread public discontent, rioting, terrorism, suicide incidents, and nuclear war descended upon Earth. As if that wasn't enough, the cats invaded Earth very soon afterwards, turning what was left of humanity into a bunch of rats and enslaving the human population.\n\nUnder the cats' rule, the rats suffered dearly. A rat's expected lifespan was in constant decline, from an average of 110 years of age before the invasion to a new average of 20 years. A newspaper, written by our protagonist and titled "Bad Rats," soon emerged. It called for open revolt against the rule of the cats, arguing that they were exploiting the rats to live their own aristocratic lifestyles. The contents were scoffed by the cats, but the rats soaked in every word of it. From the newspaper stemmed rumors of deportation, torture, mass executions, and anything else that could stir revolutionary fervor. The first incidents of revolt occurred in decentralized acts of terrorism. The cats responded by banning the circulation of "Bad Rats," tightening their grip over the rats, and starting a process of rendering the rats unable to read or write. This, however, did nothing to contain the rats\' growing hatred towards the cats.\n\nOn September 13, 2081, the revolution began. An armed mob of rats seized Florida from the cats, inspiring revolts across the entire globe. Rats who were once fighting bitterly among themselves, such as terrorist rats and murican rats, now stood side by side against a common enemy: the cats. After 2 years, the rats were able to seize control of the Americas from the cats, but the cats retained a stranglehold over the rest of the world. Both sides suffered immense casualty rates in the process, and morale dropped sharply on both sides. And the war is just getting started...\n\nTo counteract the loss of morale, the rat high command gave the order to set up public executions of the cat POWs. They hired our protagonist to host such events. It is now in your hands to reinvigorate anti-cat sentiment and fuel support for the war effort by elaborately murdering the cat oppressors.\n\nThe game focuses heavily on controversial themes, forcing the player to ask why he/she exists and consider the validity of what mankind has accepted as the norm. Featuring unrivaled graphics, cunning level design that will challenge the greatest of minds, a brilliantly orchestrated OST that deserves a live performance at Carnegie Hall, and voice acting that would make Kevin Spacey and Peter Dinklage quit, this piece of artwork is the epitome of gaming and a model that all other developers should follow.\n\nThat invent4 is nice enough to sell such a flawless masterpiece at only 99 cents is a sure sign of selflessness despite the fact that the game is worth 2000 times the price of triple A modern releases.\n\nBad Rats/10 - Buy this game NOW!","May 31","true","8.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","6","6","5","1"

You might be saying "well, bad rats was released in like, 2009?" you're wrong. Bad Rats came from the story about the group that exterminated cats in 1672 B.C and they were killed for their actions. That was the beginning of Bad Rats. In 1991 Bad Rats began production for the SNES, but the owner died, and it was revisited and it was rereleased as Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge.\n\nThe game is simple: You are Gordon Freeman and you must travel to the sewers and not only find the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but you also need to kill cats because they are rebels against the Pigmask. The rats team up with you and you must kill the cats in inhumane ways. The physics are really realistic, as in you put a bulldozer rat on a balloon and the rat explodes on the balloon. To be quite honest, the physics are way better than physics in games today, such as Garry's Mod or Grand Theft Auto 5.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are as good as puzzles in games like SpaceChem or maybe even Mario Teaches Typing. It gets me stumped at times and even some times I can't even figure it out without looking up a guide. If you ever finish a fight, then you are rewarded entirely. I love it. The game has tons of guides online and the game itself is cheap, so if you need a good puzzle game, get this game.\n\nThe only downside of this game is that it tooks years, even milleniums before we got to experience the cat-killing massacre on Steam and even anywhere else on the PC. Yeah, uhh, 10/10 i guess","July 22, 2015","true","5.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","7","8","7","0"

Once you get stuck on a level it is quite challenging but the way forward is easy when you can clearly see the solution.

Only true geniuses would design a game that takes place on a 3D plane but can only be interacted with in 2D! Imagine how good Mario would have been if you could just slip off the front of a block and fall out of the play area! The game revolves around placing various rats of different skill or ability around an obstacle course in order to push a ball into a trap trigger. Doing this kills a cat in the most awkward and not-funny way possible :D The game is setup in a 2D side view (similar to a platformer) for you to plan your setup. your As mentioned earlier, certain impacts can cause the ball to roll backward or forwards, right off the 2D plane; which is... awesome. Add to that the fact that the physics are not consistent, so what may have worked one time may not work the same the next...\n\nSo, to sum things up: 11/10 BUY IT NOW!","February 20, 2013","true","2.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

The UI could have been better but is acceptable. The music is surprisingly quite good while the lack of variety and the rather bad sound effects lower the impression.\n\nWorst of all is the gameplay and it's what destroys every chance for this game to be at least okay. While the game wants to be a physics puzzle game it fails at implementing proper physics. You can rerun your contruction without changing anything and you will get different results. Placing objects is a pain and pixel-precise placement is required for some puzzles but almost impossible to be done.\n\nI really wanted to give this game a fair chance despite the bad things I have heard about it.

Its is a physics puzzle game along the lines of The Incredible machine, but it has a lot of issues and the biggest one is how random the physic is. A simple puzzle that involves bouncing the ball against one or more surfaces can work the first time and then fail the next five only to work again without you changing a single thing. This makes a lot of the levels very frustrating as you might be onto the solution but then the physics screw you over but might just be the game being bad then you being wrong.\n\nAchievements overall are pretty well designed to suit the game and are made so you have to think differently on how to solve each level. This is sadly ruined by what I mention above as you just want the game to be over.

As what's left of the nation's Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as "Rats" leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. In Bad Rats: Revenge you don't just create a class, you create a soldier. Choose the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and you can even create a female soldier for the first time. With over 20,000 possible combinations, you can create the soldier you've always wanted. And each soldier you create will also have his or her own load outs.","January 14, 2014","true","2.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","5","5","3","0"

It was pouring down rain and I kept hearing noises upstairs in my house. It was freaking me out so, I decided to launch Garry's Mod. I was playing on sandbox server when I heard the doorbell ring. I remebered what my mom always told me, "When you're home alone, NEVER answer the door," so I thought nothing of it. I went about playing my game when I noticed a notification in the bottom right of my screen. "Archer Rat, has added you to their friends list." I thought, "what kind of name is that?" and I clicked on his profile. The only game he had on it was "Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge," a game I had never heard of. I accepted the request and immediatly, a gift popped into my inventory. I clicked my inventory and there it was. Bad Rats. My heart stopped. I took off my headset still staring at the screen and that's when I heard a muffled squeak behind me. I turned around in my chair, and Archer Rat and his possy of other Rats were behind me. They nodded at me and the screen, wanting me to play it. I looked at the screen and then denied the gift, then reached for the phone to call for help. Then, the Batter Rat hit me in the head and I don't remember anything else. I awoke in an abandoned factory with Grafitti all over the walls. I looked around the room I was in, and noticed a cage full of yellow-orange cats who looked scared out of their minds. That's when I realized it. I'm in Bad Rats. I had to get out of there. I broke from the string tying me to my chair and ran towards the only exit I could see. I ran to the nearest Police Station and told them my story. They just laughed in my face and told me I need to go home. On my long walk home in the rain, a black SUV with Golden "Cheese" shaped rims pulled up next to me. I looked up and the passenger rolled down the window. I could see a long nose and huge teeth under his hoodie. He then, raised up a Bow and shot my in the shoulder with and arrow and they sped off. Laying in the middle of the alley, bleeding to death, I am writing this review. I am telling you that if you recieve this friend request and game, play it. I am dying because I underestimated the power of the rats, an you don't need too make the same stupid mista.........\n\n\n\n7/10","December 30, 2015","true","1.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","0"

I hate my daily activies although I keep reminding myself that at the end of this dark tunnel is a holy light filled with enjoyment and happiness.\n\nI commute to my destination and look out the window and re-evaluate my life. Thoughts go through my head, primarily "What a miserable life I live. Why am I doing this?". Life's greatest wonder.\nThis same thought happens throughout the entire day. gradually getting worse to the point where I feel like curling up in the corner and just sleeping for the rest of my life; but I remind myself once again, it will get better.\n\nI return home after a lengthy, depressing day to boot up my 10 year old PC (which takes around 5-7 minutes) to get to my bland green + blue hills wallpaper - the same image I see all day, everyday.\n\nI swivel the ball in my mouse to the black and grey icon. It's labelled "Steam" so I'll call it that. After 15 minutes of Steam loading and updating on my dial-up connection I can only then see the light of my day. I see Bad Rats under the LIBRARY tab.\n\nBy this time I would usually be in game; but today is a different day - this is because Bad Rats helps me through the remainder of my day so I strongly believe that it too can help someone else in the same situation as me. I'm writing this while I wait for the game to load so I can play into the night before my computer shuts itself off due to excessive heat or a similar issue.\n\nAs I was writing this the power in my home went off so I was left in darkness; pondering to myself if what I just wrote was wasted. I put some clothes on, stepped over all the bowls, plates and feces that is covering the floor, squeezed out the wooden door then walked 3 miles to the nearest shop where I was able to restore power to my home for a few days, for a large fee. On my way back I rethought about how I was going to write this. And I did lose about 2-3 sentences but I don't feel upset about it as I knew I could come back to eternal peace. After re-entering my home I am finally here writing this.\n\nI do genuinely believe that Bad Rats is a great game and I cannot be more thankful for my friend, Aaron Price, for gifting this to me. Because of him I find the courage to work and earn enough to keep me going.","June 24, 2014","true","4.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

I needed to replay numerous times in order for me to understand. It's about a group of daring rats trying to overcome their fears while living in an oppressive society. The rats all have a backstory, and are all interesting. The description of the game's story is "You have the leader of the Nazi war machine in your sights and one clear shot. Do you have the skill and nerve to take that shot?".\n\n8/10 characters/development\nAll the characters are extremely relatable. From a timid rodent, to a dangerous darerat. They all are changed through the hardships of their adventures. Their interactions with eachother depend on the class you pick during the character customization.\n\n10/10 art/graphics\nThe art is extremely appealing with its flashy colors, and luscious mounds. The graphics are overbearing, even with my 4 titans I could hardly run the game on the lowest quality. You would need the NASA super computer to run this monster.\n\n7/10 gameplay\nThe character customization is very indepth, you get to pick your race/class/backstory which all influence the different dialogue options that can progress your relationship with each character.\n\n"Masterpiece 10/10" - IGN\n\n","June 23, 2014","true","0.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The unique physics engine keeps the game changing on every attempt! I would easily recommend this to anyone who asked me about it.\n\nFirstly the tutorial, I have never seen such a unique tutorial in my entire life. The game allows you to work out almost everything for yourself which causes the learning curve to be much higher than any modern game. I admire anyone who can complete the tutorial on the first run. There are so many options it is hard to pick one.\n\nMoving on to the levels, the grammar used is flawless and explains the story for each level extremely well. Due to these superb tips you always know where you need to reach in order to complete the level but vague enough to keep the challenge. This is obviously a much better way to go about any game with a story line as it will keep the player engaged and always looking for new ways to achieve the same result. Unlike the popular First Person Shoot-them-up franchise known as Call of Duty, Call of Duty does not allow the player to explore themselves when they are playing the single player for any of the games. There is a set route with multiple waypoints to keep the player on track with how the developers want their game to be played. This is because all of the Call of Duty franchise is aimed at dim-witted teenagers.\n\nThe characters in Bad Rats are very original. Sticking with the storyline of the rats having a dastardly plan to kill all cats. This world domination idea is very original and I have never seen it in any other game I have ever reviewed.\n\nThe difficulty levels in this game are exactly as they should be. The game will become harder as the difficulty level increases. This is something missing from many games of the current generation as they all want to offer some form of false gratification to all of the people stupid enough to buy their game.\n\nThe one flaw with this game is the lack of game-altering DLC. Invent4 Entertainment could you please get on that?\n\nOverall I would rate this game 8/8 for content, 8/8 for graphical design, 8/8 for character development and 9/8 for level design. I can honestly say this was the most fun game I have played in a very long time and you should buy this game now.","November 27, 2013","true","5.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeathWahksay/recommended/34900/","GeathWahksay","Athetos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeathWahksay/","139 products in account","Bad Rats is a game that should be played no matter who you are.\n\nThe story is engaging and beautiful. You play as Duke Nukem, whose Rhulloian prostitu♥es have been kidnapped by the blatantly-obvious villain Doctor Charlie Sh♥tting, who totally isn't Bobby Kotick wearing a fake goatee. In order to get to the underwater volcano castle in space he calls home, Duke must ally himself with a group of rats trying to kill Dr. Sh♥tting's plethora of Nazi cats, referred to as the Bad Rats Crew. However, his evil Science Machine has totally screwed up physics, making simple tasks such as hitting a baseball a challenge that would stop even a Hispanic super-agent with a magic backpack full of parachutes in his tracks. It's a stretch, but our hedonistic hero will do whatever (and I mean WHATEVER it takes to get his three-eyed alien babes back, even if it means redefining insanity.\n\nThe gameplay, however, is bad. Every time you do something, the outcome will ALWAYS be different, explosions have become implosions, and killing the not-actually-that-innocent felines takes a great deal of luck, praying to God/Satan/Allha/Cthulhu/Zeus/Vishnu/Kluex/Skrillex/what-have-you, and sometimes the strategic placement of objects. It's painful to get through levels, but the physics are just so bad they're hilarious. The gameplay suddenly changes on the super-secret hidden final level, which puts you in control of Duke fighting Sh♥tting and his Science Machine with the help of the Bad Rats and their suicide bombing jihadist rats. Surprisingly, this level is not only fun, but excellently done (and probably where all the budget went), although getting through his attack pattern will end in a couple of deaths. Notably, each level gives you 100 tries for some reason. Why 100? I don't know. There are no extra tries anywhere and the amount of tries you have is reset upon entering the next level. The only time the tries meter is actually important is the last level, where it becomes Duke's health meter.\n\nThe sound? You're better off replacing it with the gibberish spouted by a drunk Scot while unclogging the toilet that got ruined by many glass shards. While you're at it, replace the music with the Crazy Bus title screen music. The voice acting, though, is top notch, notably with Microsoft Sam's stunning performance as the Announcer. Dr. Sh♥tting's voicework is also notable. Duke's VA is just ripped from the other Duke Nukem games, but the sentence-mixing quality is very good. The final boss music is also much better than the standard theme that plays throughout the game's levels.\n\nTL;DR: The game sucks, but the story and voice acting is incredible and the final level is just good enough to not only save this game, but to make it a masterpiece.\n\nRating:\nThe phrase "AYY LMAO" minus Duke's foot out of a pope, a girl, and a guy who's searching for his butt.","January 13, 2014","true","0.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","4"

He gets his best thrills from spanking children, the idea of him being able to dominate young people with no challenge or obstacle in his horizon makes him feel powerful and consistent.\nI've had my fair share, across the face, in the stomach, cranked in my leg.\nHome is supposed to be safe and secure, warm and snug, loving and caring. But in my case, it's the exact opposite, you can't expect life to be safe and secure with a child abuser living under your roof with the claimed title `Bad Rats`.\nYou can't expect any love or care from a psychopathic game with no friends or family, just as much as you can't grant any warmth or comfort in a locked clustered basement underneath laminate flooring and wood fitted with carpet.\nI would like to take a moment to ask you, the reader, what would you do in this situation? Got an answer? Good, because I can guarantee you my response was much worse.\n\nIt was Monday 14th July 1998 at around 3PM when I finished the school day, the sun was gleaming down onto my spotty and greasy face leaving me with heat annoyance and a brush of sweat on the top of my forehead.\nI continued to walk, with no enthusiasm from my bruised body. What could possibly be wrong? I walked so miserably because I knew in at least twenty minutes or so my bruises would become cuts and then evolve into blood stains.\nLike magic? My copy of Bad Rats would say after he pasted my face into a whole new appearance. If only he knew what was coming to him.\nI soon walked upon my house, oh how I can remember them dark days up in my room. My stomach felt like blood beaten butterflies floating motionlessly in my unfed stomach.\nI swallowed. I took a second swallow.\nMy heart was beating in such an inconsistent manner it made me feel sick. He made me feel sick.\nWith one last gulp I proceeded toward the house, but then, the oddest object occurrence entered my view. Laying there on the summer green grass was the object that would change my life for both the better and worse.\nMy mother used to slit her wrists with the very same object until she ended up taking her own life to escape this tragedy that we all refer to as `life.`\nOnly I wasn't taking my own life, I was taking Bad Rats life. I scooped the object up with pure determination and raged anger.\nI will avenge my darling mother even if it is the last thing I do.\nI clutched down the door handle like a psychopathic lunatic until I entered onto the hallway.\n“Is that you boy? Because I've got a big surprise waiting for you!”\nSo have I, you dirty faced prick, I thought almost seemingly out loud.\nI heard his trying to be intimidating footsteps from his groggy rats come closer... And closer.\nHe towered over me, glaring at me through his black rat eyes.\n“Ain’t you gonna ask what it is, you ungrateful brat!” He exclaimed cockily, making himself stand more straight in a proud sort of manner.\n“I was just gonna ask you the same thing. Bat Rats.”\nWith a flow of confidence, I slid out the knife from beneath my left sleeve, I impulsively rushed the knife into his stomach just about 2cm below his chest,\nHe screamed out in shock and pain, his legs buckled as the blood trickled down to his purposely ripped jeans.\n“Or would you prefer me to call you noob, you prick!”\nI grinned like a little child on my birthday, the blood squirting out of him like a fountain made me feel in control, made me feel powerful.\n“Y-you a-a-ain't gett-ing a-away fr-fr-from m-me!”\nMy game crashed, trying to approach me, trying to end me.\n\n10/10 GOTY","July 24, 2014","true","0.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It makes me believe that we really have hit the pinnacle of technology and gaming.Its going to take a hell of alot to beat this game and no one will be doing that any time soon.It really makes me think will games get any better than this, i remember playing super mario on my cousins NES and thinking "Holy ♥♥♥♥ this is the most amazing thing mankind have ever created and ever will, its over theres literally no point in playing games anymore if ive allready played a perfect one" But then one day i logged onto steam and bought this gem.\n\nThe menus in this game are just peices of pure ♥♥♥♥ing art, now you might say that art is subjective or its your own opinion but i ♥♥♥♥ing dare  you to find a picture of the Bad Rats title screen and not faint. I ♥♥♥♥ you not this is better than any peice of art that has been and gone in this world.\n\nDont even get me started on the cutscenes, i swear to good ill ♥♥♥♥ing pass out and have a ♥♥♥♥ing seizure.There just something down right special i actually thought i was watching Shawshank redemption at one point but then as the cutscene faded i saw the face that i came to love.\n\nThis game is ♥♥♥♥ing great 9.9/10 (I dont believe in a PERFECT game) buy it and youll never look at your computer the same way again. I even wanked over this game at one point.\n\nLol jk tho this game is a peice of ♥♥♥♥...\n\n","June 7, 2014","false","0.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

The problem is, I'm not sure if Intel has the technology or the resources required to manufacture in mass quantities a highly advanced technological device; we simply just do not have the current knowledge to understand the deep underlying processes of Bad Rats very effectively without examining the inner workings of the brain that exists within the creator's head. There is even a rumor circulating the internet that Intel might also be trying to include a 13 FoV option. We are arriving into an age of photorealism, my fellow gentlemen. We are now going to receive a field of vision that completely surpassess what we can normally see, a framerate so smooth and fast that we will be unable to detect anymore differences in the stuttering and jaggedness of animation, and a resolution so ravishing that we will be completely unable to work out even the smallest of graphical irregularities thanks to the near-microscopic capabilities of digital imagery.

Once I launched the game I knew my hard work had payed off. While in-game my girlfriend broke up with me, the doctor called to tell me I had aids, ebola, and cancer, and pneumonic plague. As I continued through the game after that devastating news I also got a phone call stating that my electricity bill had skyrocketed and that I owed 20000 dollars. As soon as my 20 minutes hit my computer screen sizzled and cracked and the glass shattered, which stabbed both of my eyes and made me blind, the computer sent out jolts of electricty to everywhere on my body, it then continued by emitting a very high noise breaking both my eardrums, the computer then blew up and sent shards of computer shrapnel through my body giving me permanent brain damage.

I think that the hate comes because of the theme of the game. Yeah, the story is weird and morbid: The rats are killing cats in Mortal Kombat Style. But, I dont understand why all the hate becuase of the storyline? Conker from Conker's Bad Fur Day is a squirell that drinks beer and pisses on people made of rock and nobody complained about it. Anyway, let's switch to the actual review.\nThe concept is great: you use your rats, barrel, baloon, umbrela, trampoline, box and a plank to push the ball to the trap that kills the cat. You have to place your rats and objects on the level in paused mode and then hope for the best in "play" mode. The levels can be solved in a really many ways, which is really great because it takes your creativity to the test.  At the beggining of the level, you are given hints and map plan, but they are mostly missleading, so I would recommend turning off the map plan and not reading the hints. The hints and map plans are only helpful in first four levels, but later they become less useful. Also, the hints are written in much worse English than my own.\nThe rats are fun(ny) to watch, esspecially the Terrorist rats. Their idling animation and design are just hillarious.\nThe graphics are bad, even for an 2009 indie game. There are only few graphical options that doesnt improve graphics at all.\nBut, the thing that ruins this great concept is the gameplay itself. This game is also known, besides for it's theme, for the random physics. Early in the review, I said "hope for the best" and now it's the time to explain you what does that mean. Every time you press the play button, something different happends. Some levels even requires pure luck, which means tapping play buttons until your combination of object and rats works. That just suck, but it isnt that bad.\nAt the end, we can conclude that this is one underrated game. It is a bad game, but by bad I mean hillariously bad. It's definetly not the worst game, there are many worse titles in the Steam store. You can find this game at the trading sites for a really cheap prices and this game is often going 90% off, so it's definetly worth the price of 0.39 euros.","July 15, 2013","true","8.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The problem is, I'm not sure if Intel has the technology or the resources required to manufacture in mass quantities a highly advanced technological device; we simply just do not have the current knowledge to understand the deep underlying processes of Bad Rats very effectively without examining the inner workings of the brain that exists within the creator's head. There is even a rumor circulating the internet that Intel might also be trying to include a 13 FoV option. We are arriving into an age of photorealism, my fellow gentlemen. We are now going to receive a field of vision that completely surpassess what we can normally see, a framerate so smooth and fast that we will be unable to detect anymore differences in the stuttering and jaggedness of animation, and a resolution so ravishing that we will be completely unable to work out even the smallest of graphical irregularities thanks to the near-microscopic capabilities of digital imagery.

AMIDST all the crises under which we suffer and which do but present a single connected picture, perhaps that which the people feels most acutely is the economic crisis. The political crisis, the moral crisis, are only very rarely felt by the individual. The average man sees in the experiences of his day not that which affects the community as a whole but for the most part only that which strikes himself. Therefore the present has only very rarely any consciousness of political or moral collapse, so long as this collapse does not extend in one way or another into economic life. For when this happens it is no longer a question of some abstract problem that can perhaps be observed or studied in its effect on others, but one day the individual himself will be caught hold of by this question, and the more intimately such a crisis begins to influence his own life, the more clearly does he come to recognize that existing conditions cannot remain as they are. Then all of a sudden people talk of economic distress, of economic misery, and then, starting from this distress, one can awaken an understanding for that other distress which otherwise is wont to remain for a long time hidden from the individual man.\n\nIt is not enough to say that the German economic distress is a phenomenon resulting from a world crisis, from a general economic distress, since, of course, exactly in the same way every other people could plead the same excuse, could adduce the same reason. It is clear that even so this distress cannot have its roots all over the world, those roots must always be found within the life of peoples. And though only one thing is probably true - that these roots are perhaps the same in the case of many peoples - yet one cannot hope to master this distress by the mere statement that the presence of a certain distress is a feature of the age; rather it is clearly a necessity to disclose these roots in the internal life of a single people and to cure the distress there where one can really effect a cure.\n\nUnfortunately it is precisely the German who is only too inclined at such times, instead of looking at his own internal life, to let his gaze range into the far distance. Our people has been so long falsely taught to think in international terms that even in such a distress as the present it tends to treat this problem, too, from international points of view. And the result is that many of us simply cannot believe that perhaps it might be possible to remedy such a misfortune in some other way than by international methods. And yet that is an error. It is natural that international infirmities which afflict all peoples in one way or another must be removed by the peoples who suffer from them, but that in no way alters the fact that every people must wage this battle on its own behalf, and above all that no single people can be liberated from this distress by international methods if it does not for its own part take the necessary measures. These measures can, of course, find their place within the framework of international measures, but one's own action must not be made dependent upon the action of others.\n\nThe crisis in German economics is not merely a crisis which is expressed by our economic statistics, but it is above all a crisis which can also be traced in the internal course of our economic life, in the character of its organization, etc. And here we can indeed speak of a crisis which has hit our people more severely than other peoples. It is the crisis which we see in the relations between capital, economics, and people. This crisis is particularly obvious in the relations between our workmen and the employers. Here the crisis has been more acute than in any other country in the world....\n\nThe first cause lies in the alteration in the form of business organization which determined the character of our economics. That cause may be traced throughout the world precisely as in Germany....\n\nThe gradual alienation of classes which we in Germany experienced led to the appearance on the one side of the special interests of the employers and on the other side the special interests of the employed. This was the beginning of our unhappy economic development. When one had once started on this road, of necessity the two sides became ever more widely separated. Here a law governs human affairs: when one has once chosen the wrong road this road always leads one further from reason.\n\nOn the contrary, the road led necessarily to further alienation and this tendency, as I said, was favored by the depersonalization of property. And I might almost say that this process was apparently still further encouraged and strengthened on scientific grounds. There gradually arose an ideology which believed that it could permanently support the conception of property even though those who derived any practical profit from the conception no longer represented more than a minimal percentage of the nation. And on the other hand there arose the view that, since there was now only so small a percentage of those who enjoyed property, the conception of private property as such should be abandoned....\n\nWhen one has once started on this course, then logically the employers will in turn form their organization. And as a matter of course these two organizations will not pursue their own ends in mutual toleration, but they will maintain their apparently separate interests with those weapons which are given them: viz, lockouts and strikes. In this warfare sometimes one and sometimes the other side will conquer. But in either case it is the whole nation which will have to pay the cost of this warfare and suffer the damage. And the final result of this development is that these organizations as they build themselves up, considering the passion of the German for bureaucratization, will continuously become more unwieldy and their personnel will grow constantly larger. And at length the organization will no longer serve the interests of its creators, but these will be subservient to the organization, so that the warfare is continued in order that the existence of the organization may be justified, even though at times reason suddenly comes and says; 'The whole affair is madness; the gain when compared with the sacrifices is positively ludicrous. If you reckon up the sacrifices which we make for the organization they are far greater than any possible profit.' Then the organizations in their turn will have to prove how necessary they are by stirring up the parties to fight each other. And then it may even be that the two organizations come to an understanding, when once they have realized the situation.\n\nThe second reason is the rise of Marxism. Marxism, as a conception of the world with disintegration for its aim, saw with keen insight that the trade-union movement offered it the possibility in the future of conducting its attack against the State and against human society with an absolutely annihilating weapon. Not with any idea of helping the worker -what is the worker of any country to these apostles of internationalism? Nothing at all! They never see him! They themselves are no workers: they are alien litterateurs, an alien gang! . . .\n\nOne had to inoculate the trade union with the idea: You are an instrument of the class war and that war in the last resort can find its political leaders only in Marxism. What is then more comprehensible than that one should also pay one's tribute to the leadership? And the tribute was exacted in full measure. These gentlemen have not been content with a tithe: they demanded a considerably higher rate of interest.\n\nThis class war leads to the proclamation of the trade union as simply an instrument for the representation of the economic interests of the working classes and therewith for the purposes of the general strike. Thus the general strike appears for the first time as a means for exercising political power and shows what Marxism really hoped to gain fr","December 30, 2013","true","4.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

This hit very close to me, and many more, creating an amazing and emotional aura around me whilst i played this game. It brang a tear to my eye as i saw (SPOILER ALERT)  the cat get microwaved.\n\nNext, the graphics. When was the last time your eyes saw something that looks this real to life? Probably when you went outisde all them weeks ago. This keeps me up to date on what life looks like after 7 weeks of playing bad rats non stop, only taking time out to write this review.

Among those words, there is none more dangerous than “perfect.” Yet I've previously and quite brazenly used it to describe Bad Rats, and I still stand by the statement today. That’s not just about Bad Rats' game mechanics--though those are sublime. Despite the limitless possibilities of games, very few ever present something genuinely, radically new or demand a fresh way of thinking about the world. Bad Rats does both, exploring its concepts with gratifying depth and flawless pacing.\n\nTo do that would be enough, but Bad Rats also binds the intellectual seamlessly with the emotional, crafting a sumptuously warm, human, funny, and terrifying story as a welcoming channel into its heady concepts. INVENT4's masterpiece blends game mechanics and character development to a startlingly affecting degree, constantly bolstering one with the other to create an utterly complete and fulfilling whole. Forget the brief running time. A second longer would be an ill-judged extravagance. Bad Rats is a precision-engineered masterpiece from start to finish. It is, simply, perfect.\n","July 12, 2013","true","32.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

A Lord of The Rats, if you will, presented stylishly in an interactive medium.

It's horrible, I would've not thought it possible, but here we are.\n\nBad Rats is unique. It attempts to be something similiar to games like Angry Birds or Spelunky by creating a theme that's quite comical. Rats killing cats. It's like from an old children's movie. Though this attempt is unsuccesful and the game comes out as a weird experiment which still provides some challenge, though.\n\nThe graphics are horrible, the gameplay is not what you desire and the game is spoiled with extreme stereotypes and racism. Soundtrack is decent and provides variety, but the game is rather repetitive.\n\nBut the extreme forte of this game is the price. I recommend one purchases it when it's on sale, for then the game usually costs less than a dollar/euro. During sales this game becomes one of the cheapest games in Steam. This game, providing enough gameplay to fulfill the discounted price when it IS discounted, makes it a pretty decent game to compete with other puzzle games.","December 22, 2013","true","1.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It turned me into a rat. My keen senses then directed me to the nearest cat and I had a sense of bloodshed. My first instinct was to scroll slowly over to it at 1-2 FPS and bulldozer it off a nearby bomb shelter. I always loved it when the cat's blood spilled in 3000 pieces, including his stupid yellow brain. I was rewarded not only with cheese, but with cat blood spewing from his mouth. I now reside in a swaggy alleyway with 3 wives and super pimped out kids. I teach them my hunting tecniques. They learn. We spread. I prosper.

It makes you think. Solving the little puzzle to get the rats to kill the cat was silly. The animation is not too bad. I think what would make this better is if it was a mobile game. I would probably have spent more time on it. For those that enjoy puzzle sort of games I do not think this would be too bad.","November 21, 2014","true","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's horrible, I would've not thought it possible, but here we are.\n\nBad Rats is unique. It attempts to be something similiar to games like Angry Birds or Spelunky by creating a theme that's quite comical. Rats killing cats. It's like from an old children's movie. Though this attempt is unsuccesful and the game comes out as a weird experiment which still provides some challenge, though.\n\nThe graphics are horrible, the gameplay is not what you desire and the game is spoiled with extreme stereotypes and racism. Soundtrack is decent and provides variety, but the game is rather repetitive.\n\nBut the extreme forte of this game is the price. I recommend one purchases it when it's on sale, for then the game usually costs less than a dollar/euro. During sales this game becomes one of the cheapest games in Steam. This game, providing enough gameplay to fulfill the discounted price when it IS discounted, makes it a pretty decent game to compete with other puzzle games.","December 22, 2013","true","1.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
