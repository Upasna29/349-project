The controls are reponsive and feel good.\n\nThe story, presented in comic book fashion, is quite entertaining. You are a guardian, a hero, awakened (unintentionally) from stasis during a world invasion and are the worlds last and only hope.\n\nBut your powers are unstable and you tend to spontaneously explode if you are too idle or slow. You have a need for...exploding and it's better to put them to good use. The pace is constant and quick.","March 27, 2014","true","3.2"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","32","42","0","0"

And it definitely pays homage to this genre of games.\n\nYou can see that this game takes elements from classics such as Mega Man X, while still having an unique gameplay in the form of explosions. And those are used in a pretty nice way for both gameplay and stage hazards. You can use explosions to jump higher, move faster, lift objects and of course, annihilate the Aliens that are attacking the planet you were created. On that note though, there isn't really much of an interesting story but it is comedical nonetheless. Explodemon can also be seen as a fun character, because he is a bit sadistic when it comes to exploding.\n\nThe graphics aren't outstanding but they fit the game well. The music is pretty forgettable unfortunately. Also, this game isn't very long. It only has 12 stages which can be completed in a short amount of time. Fortunately, the customization of your Explodemon makes up for it, which comes in the form op upgrades. There are also various collectables and achievements, also coming with rankings at the end of each stage which counts for a nice amount of replayability.\n\nThis game brings back nostalgia to my SNES days and does it in a great way. If you're a fan of 2d platformers or just want to try out something new, Explodemon might be just the game you're looking for. Also note: a controller is not necessary, but I would recommend using it anyways.","March 29, 2014","true","2.7"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/281820/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","A good platformer, but not a great one.\nThe main issues first:\n-Boost Run doesn't always seem to trigger properly, either that or its triggering mechanics aren't properly explained, I had many deaths due to this.\n- Difficulty spikes out of nowhere in the second half by introduction of instant death that was entirely absent from the first half. A bit late to introduce that kind of stuff, I think.\n-Third world is generally a bit of a mess level-design wise. Lots of physics puzzles that don't quite work, a puzzle involving avoiding the goal ring, an anticlimactic and kind of shoddily designed final boss, just generally not as fun as the rest of the game.\n-Kind of samey graphic-wise throughout, and the only boss battles are all facing the same opponent, just in different battlefields.\n-You won't get much out of this game if you don't like exploring and collecting shinies scattered throughout the levels.\n\nAside from these issues what there is here is a pretty decent platformer. The explosion mechanic is used in various interesting ways and is an effective end-all to any other abilities. The close-range combat tends to work well most of the time, though against the flying enemies that also happen to have projectiles you always feel a bit underpowered. The levels are all quite meaty, taking 15-20+ minutes on a first playthrough. The S-ranks and speedruns both tend to be both challenging and fun to attempt,  without being unfairly difficult. There's plenty of creative puzzles and a good number of platforming challenges as well. The in-game shop system doesn't really require much if any grinding to buy all the upgrades, assuming you shoot for S-ranks in every level. It's a very solid package overall. Not something I'd tell my friends to go out and buy right now you have to play it guys, but something I'd recommend for anyone interested in platformers at the very least. It's a fun game overall with only mild frustration present.","October 23, 2014","true","15.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

The writing is hilarious, gameplay is great and very reminiscent of classic platformers (like the Mega Man X series) but maybe with a slightly more forgiving level of difficulty. Besides being an homage to such platformers it's a great game in it's own right. Good controls, interesting mechanics, good level design and can be played both as an action platformer and a puzzle platformer. If you're going for 100% there will be some puzzle solving, but any% doesn't require much in that department.\n\nAdditionally, it seems like an ideal game for speedrunning, but sadly no one seems to have picked it up.","May 24, 2014","true","16.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The humor is nice. The idea of the game as well: Explodemon can jump and explode, no other weapons. The controls though, well... They are ok in the beginning. But then, when it's about precision, some moves feel immature, like the charge (run+explode). Some of the bonus-areas can be lost by exploding too close to a create one could have needed. Back to checkpoint, try it again. Some checkpoints are chosen badly: You have to press through a dialogue you can speed up, but not abort. And finally, what ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off really hard was the leveldesign of the last world. There were parts, you had to die through to get an idea of how to finish them at all. Especially the last level before the last bossfight. Holy crap. Was this meant to be an homage to Boshy as well?\n\nI really liked the game from the descriptive content here on the storepage. And it began pretty laidback. But instead of becoming more difficult, it just became nasty and unfair in some places. When you have the feeling that it's not about your skill, but bad luck, it's bad. That ruined it for me in the end. Played through it, will probably never play it again.\n\nBut I'll still give it a thumbs up, as the rest is pretty nice and other, more failure-resistant people might not have a problem with what I had problems with.","September 23, 2014","true","8.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/281820/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","A pretty darn fun game. Very original concept that your only weapon is that when you press A to attack (am using a xbox 360 controller like anyone should for games like this)  you explode and the closer you are to an enemy the more dmg it does. You want to be about a centimeter away from them so you do good dmg because even a little too far away and you barely do any at all. What is cool is when you explode really close it briefly freezes and shows a button mash icon and you can mash attack to explode several times more. It makes taking down bigger or more annoying enemies easier. You also explode to boost jump to out of reach places which is about 99% of the game. Boost jumping and running are what the levels are built around. The sound is fine and the music is fitting and the controls are great, very responsive. The only thing that imo leaves a lot to be desired are the graphics. They aren't bad, and effects are well done, but the level graphics are just mostly very plain. The enemies are all the same color too for the most part: dark blue and neon green. It also gets very frustrating in the third world. The challenge is always good and not unfair, but what I mean is that you can take quite a while to clear a screen and get all of the powerups in that screen, then one easy slip-up insta-death and you are starting over from the beginning of that screen. An insta-death such as boost running over acid and there is a slight rise in the floor ahead so you have to jump over it but it is so unnoticeable that nobody is going to see it on their first try. So there is inevitably some forced trial and error and that is not very cool.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me is that during one of the stages your character makes a reference to "Bangbus" which is a hardcore porn site where guys drive around in a bus and pick up random girls and bang them in the bus. It is all obviously rigged, but nonetheless still hardcore porn. I do not get how I can be banned for three months on steam for complaining in the forums about how the monday deals are always for garbage games but these devs can make straight up blatant references to promote very specific hardcore porn film makers in their games. Porn is great don't get me wrong, it just seemed very unnecessary and completely unfunny to mention "bangbus" in this game or any game for that matter.\n\nOverall though I got my money's worth as thankfully it is finally a indie game that is longer than ten seconds of playtime. I am really getting tired of game makers just pushing out incredibly short games to make a fast dollar.\n\nFun original concept, some minor flaws, and decent level graphics. 7/10","October 27, 2014","true","7.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

A robot whose only weapon is the explosions he causes all the time? Yeah...that DOES work as a concept! :D\nIt ties in with the humor (the planet's leaders rather surrender to their enemies than use their last chance of beating them - by using you), and the Engrish quotes tend to grow on you.\nThe game itself plays well, is fun and flows quite reasonable (wallsliding could be implemented better, but it's doable).\n\nMy only real gripe is that it's terribly short. 12 levels in total isn't much to go by. Granted, they're all but small levels, and the design of them is pretty good, but still...I thought I was just about halfway at that point. :-\\nBut all in all...it's better to have a small game choked with quality than a large one that is kind of 'meh' to play through.","January 17, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This means that you are bombing enemies up close, or dashing through them while exploding (sort of...). Boost-jumping, sliding, chaining are required to get through the generous levels, and completionists will have something to bite into here too, as each level has hidden icons to find. Most of these are not accessible right away, either.\n\nGraphically the game is nice, with a smooth, solid, 3D appearance to the world. Your character is quite small on the screen, but there is no issue with controlling him, and the explosions and timing required is mostly responsive and intuitive. There's upgrades, replayability and a rating system for the levels, as well as challenging 'par' times that will please speed-running players.
