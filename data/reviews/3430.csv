This game is very simple.... very, very, very, simple.  For adults I would say this game would be rather easy, the difficult parts involve memorizing what pizzas go to what location.  The memory part involves pizzas appearing such as one with pepperoni and some regular, then they disappear and you need to remember who wanted what kind of pizza.  The game is made well, no bugs, seems great for kids.  Its very colorful and the sounds are fun when it yells at you "Pizza Frenzy!!!!".  The pizzas look good in this game kinda like claymation food that always looks super delicious making me order a pizza from playing the game.  There are three modes of play from memory to speed to a simon says mode, for adults these all are very simple, for kids this could help develop good hand to eye motor skills further due to its point and click style of gameplay mixed with memorization.\n\nRating for Adults:  1/10  Value:  $0.99\nRating for Kids:  10/10   Value:  $9.99 (Makes a great virtual babysitter.)","March 10, 2014","true","0.3"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","21","27","4","0"

Its a simple game were you get orders and have to drag that order to the corresponding place. Try to get a perfect score for a high score. Its a simple point click game. The sounds in the game can get repetitive but you get used to it after awhile. This game doesn't take long to beat. It is for anyone that likes a simple game which is alot of fun.","March 12, 2011","true","5.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I got bored pretty quick.  I could see it has been helpful to kids learning how to use a mouse, click but they will most likely get bored after 15-30 minutes.  I would recommend buying the bundle and not this game individually since there are a lot of other great games in the bundle.","November 29, 2015","true","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Easy to learn, "plug & play" but, with increasing difficulty and clear instructions before every new thing to learn. Intense rythm, you are always clicking the mouse, no time to rest. Original, they can be based on anything else but they do their own way and with outstanding imagination. The right difficulty at the right time, to maintain the interest. Variated play modes. Ridiculous simple controls, usually just the mouse and their two buttons, some times the arrows pad is also neeced but, that's all. Very good music and sound effects....\nWell, if you already played Zuma, you know what I mean but, they have other interesting titles and this is one of them.\nHighly recommeded for casual tmes, when you are in a hurry and want to play just a bit or, for that "in between big games" time.\nONE OF THE WEAKEST BUT, EVEN THIS, PLAYABILITY IS ENSSURED.","September 14, 2012","true",""," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I admit this game was an impulse buy for me. I grabbed it without much research because I thought it was a throwback to the old Pizza Tycoon game of years gone by.\nSadly it is not.\nIt is essentially an acarde memory game. Match pizza orders with shops that sell the pizza in question. This is not  a tycoon game and it is NOT a 'Build Your Own Pizza Simulator' wherein you try to construct innovative pizzas to sell in your restaurant.\n\nThis game is gets a negative vote because, unfortunately, no description exists on the store page.","July 14, 2014","false","0.2"," 17 of 38 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","17","38","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mistressbeagle/recommended/3430/","mistressbeagle","MissBunny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mistressbeagle/","430 products in account","Pizza Frenzy is adorable. Pizza Frenzy is addictive. You basically play as a pizza air traffic controller, clicking on pizza orders and then clicking on one of your pizza restaurants that serves that topping. Apparently your pizza restaurant can only serve one topping at a time, but that doesn't seem to really matter. Level up your toppings, make combos to get "Pizza Frenzy" and earn fat tips from celebrities and deliver pizza to the hobos who randomly keep changing their order. Get praised for every pizza frenzy and feel good about yourself; the way your father never made you feel. It's a fun, fast paced, easy to play game. I don't exactly know what the money you earn is for though. Thanks Popcap for another funnel for where I can toss my spare time in. <3 8/10","June 11, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
