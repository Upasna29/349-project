"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/287290/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","The following is a review of the game from a long-time Resident Evil fan.\n\nResident Evil Revelations 2 is a decidedly low-budget affair, it's not particularly graphically impressive and there is a level of jank to it all. However, behind this lays what may be one of the stronger Resident Evil games in years that manages to be a solid episodic title, a solid survival-action game, and more atmosphere and horror-oriented and feeling more like 'Resident Evil' than probably the last several RE games combined.\n\nNow I say that as someone who actually liked Resident Evil Umbrella+Darkside Chronicles, RE5, Revelations 1, and Resident Evil 6 well enough for what they were. RE5 and RE6 were fun action co-op games for me, RE5 was a fun arcade shooter with some fun monsters, RE6 had some fun combat mechanics with a sort of uneven-quality campaign but great Mercenaries. Revelations 1 was okay, I enjoyed it well enough, but its handheld origins showed strongly and really, the design of the game was kind of dull at times, and it never quite gave that classic Resident Evil feel it claimed it would.  But Raid Mode was a joy for me.\n\nHowever, I think with this title it's helped me better understand what element is missing from those games, besides the obvious flaws that something like Resident Evil 6 has, Revelations 2 comes as something of a reminder of elements of RE I deeply appreciate and love that have been mostly absent in recent years. That's not to say this is some complete return to form or a classic-styled survival-horror game, but it recalls back to the older series while also not quite feeling it's living in the past.\n\nWhile the graphics leave some things to be desired, the sound design is well-handled. It doesn't quite have the memorable moody tunes of the original series, but the dynamic shifts of the music, the audio design of ambiance and monsters is well-handled, with good depth of audio for headphone users, and a good layer of subtlety which help propel the title further to a more engaging experience.\n\nThis is a much slower experience than recent Resident Evil's. That's not to say it doesn't have its action-full moments, but even those comparatively to recent RE titles feel more constrained and leveled, and a lot of the time you find yourself scouting locations, looking for hidden items, sneaking past or onto enemies with a new stealth system (that's a bit flawed sometimes, but functional).\n\nBefore I continue, I shall mention like I do with most Resident Evil titles, I played this game on the hardest difficulty available from the start, Survival. I did my first run in Revelations 1 on Infernal, I played RE6 on Professional on the 360 before No Hope existed. However, this is probably tied for me right now with Code Veronica as the most challenging RE on Hard difficulty. Revelations 1 had some artificial difficulty spikes on Infernal (the first chapter and final boss fight come to mind), but this feels more like a challenge. I've discovered Survival both lowers the amount of ammo you get, and adds specific trickier enemy placements. I wouldn't recommend it for the easily frustrated, but for those who like a challenge and an amplified survival element, I would recommend it.\n\nAnd maybe in part to this I found the game to have a bigger survival aspect than the recent RE's, I found myself struggling more for ammo and health than I can recall in any recent survival-action, horror, or the like games. Even in a lot of older RE's I would be stockpiled with a lot of supplies past the very beginning, but here I found myself aching for specific ammo types and herbs on a number of occasions. But not to my lament, I found it a joy, with the slower-pace. The lack of constant action with more of a focus on survival and playing more intelligently and preservative brought back certain feelings I haven't felt from the series in a while.\n\nThe element I was most surprised by though was the story. This isn't some masterfully crafted tale, but the story feels like a Resident Evil story. One of the single most disappointing elements of RE6 and Revelations 1 for me happened to be their narratives, the characters lacked playfully fun tones often, the files were a bore, the stories delved into the ridiculous, and not in a good way, and often came up as boring and forgettable. This game has single-handily pushed Barry as one of my favorite characters in the series, had a child character in Natalia that is actually not annoying and enjoyable, the ridiculous cussing of Moira actually didn't totally turn me off from her character and she became likable by the end of it, and it has what in my opinion is the best villain the series has had in years. Claire unfortunately is missing some of her charm from RE2 and Code Veronica, but I also find herself in this game fairly unoffensive. Unlike the first 'Revelations', this game actually feels super connected with the rest of the series, episodes end with actually impactful cliffhangers, and the overall story feels like actual revelations to the series that makes me interested to see where they take it in the future. The story managed to be enjoyable throughout, make me care, make me laugh, and unexpectedly delivered a few moments that put me on the bit of the edge of feelsy and realizing I actually like these characters, something no recent RE has been able to afflict on me.\n\nIt's also notable that there's only a small handful of QTEs in the game, that aren't harmful, and it happens to be the only game I can think of that got forced walking sections correctly. That's usually a huge game design sin for me, but the moments are very rare and when it happens it both makes sense and actually works.\n\nOne of the game's finer strengths is its monster design and encounters. Some of the monsters found in the game are among some of my favorites in recent RE's, and they're backed with memorable and some of the most tense encounters I feel in the series history. Boss encounters are infrequent, but the few that are here managed to be good ones in my opinion, with a few maybe being some of my favorite tense boss encounters in the series. While not specifically a chainsaw, this game probably has my favorite 'chainsaw enemy' since Dr. Salvador, and a boss fight in Claire's Chapter 3 is a fun and wonderfully RE-styled boss fight. I even thought the final boss was the best final boss the series had seen in the last few years, and I agree with others, the good ending was probably the best ending a Resident Evil game has had in over a decade.\n\nThen there's small touches that bring the game together. Certain things you do in Claire's scenario affects Barry's, some being as subtle as picking up ammo and herbs not making it available for Barry/Natalia, to minor cool things, like turning on the flamethrower to aid Claire in episode 1 causes there to be an additional obstacle in Barry's episode 1, to nice subtle things like a certain monster you can fight or run from in one of Claire's episodes will change completely what Barry has to do or encounter... The episodes get progressively better in my opinion, and some of the later stuff feels a lot like older RE, including a few light, easy, but fun puzzles in episode 3, and a certain fun section in the last episode...\n\nOne disappointing thing is, despite spending hours in it already and enjoying it well enough, I think I've concluded that Raid Mode in Revelations 2 I don't find as enjoyable as Raid Mode in Revelations 1. There's aspects I like about it more, like character-specific abilities, the new monster buffs, the higher number of stages... But most of the stages being from RE6, as well as just not as well designed or varied as Revelations 1, and the whole thing lacking an over-arching fun challenge like Ghost Ship, I think is deeply felt.\n\nProbably the most 'Resident Evil' the series has felt in years, and a fantastic budgeted spin-off.","April 20, 2015","true","58.9"," 299 of 333 people (90%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","90","299","333","11","14"

I won't spoil anything, but I just want to touch upon it. Creepy atmosphere was definitely still there, still prefer Claire and Moira's campaign, as there were much more tense moments. There's a similar scene to RE4 and RE5 where you basically have to hold your ground in a house while enemies are trying to break in. That was great. And in both campaigns you get to meet your first boss fights. Claire's campaign's boss fight is much more dynamic if you will, lots of things going on, granted I am playing on hard difficulty. I don't know how many times I died. Barry's boss fight was more of a rinse and repeat type of thing, at least to me,  it was alright.. But outcome was pretty much the same, I came out of both boss fights with either little ammo (I'm talking like 10 rounds left or less) or none at all with one to no herbs left. That feeling of initial helplessness when you see what you have to overcome with what little you have left is just great, does really bring back old RE memories of resource management. But I did find myself thinking "whhhyyyyy" or "NOOOOooooooooooooo" when I see what I have to face with such little ammunition left, but it's good. That's what survival horror is about. I'm really liking Revelations 2 at the moment. The game isn't completely patched up well yet though, raid mode is definitely still has issues. Campaign for me seems to be working quite well, except for areas where I have to restart b/c I died, I have stuttering and fps issues for the first 30 seconds or so. Partner AI can be pretty dumb at times too, more times than not they kind of just stand there and get whacked.\n\n\n\n\nI'm writing this review soley based on the game itself, not based on the PC co-op blunder, because honestly I feel like not enough people are giving credit to where it's due, and also, I'm not that big on co-op either in the main story, but I would definitely like to see co-op in raid mode.\n\nAnyway, on to the review.\n\nSo far, Revelations 2 has a great atmosphere. Pretty creepy at times, and it does definitely bring back memories of old RE titles because there are areas of back tracking, such a refreshment from the linear RE6 campaign. Revelations 2 plays a bit like The Last of Us, which is a good thing. I love the new implementation of being able to crouch. And the afflicted that come running at you is pretty nerve racking, which is similar to the runners in TLoU. Also similar to TLoU is the crafting system, although not as robust, but just reminded me of it. The ability to swap characters anytime you wish is something I really like too, more so in Claire and Moira's campaign than Barry's, but nonetheless, I'm liking this new gameplay addition. Does certainly give the player more freedom.   I am also quite fond of the new dodge mechanic. Much better than the dodge mechanic from the first revelations, and isn't over the top like in RE6  (jumping to the side and rolling and getting up again). I do feel like Revelations 2 strikes a nice balance in terms of being not too action-y and not too tank control like. However, I would like slightly tighter controls during sprinting. One thing I LOVE is that enemies do not have health or ammo drops. YES. This is what I'm talking about. I legitimately was running out of ammo on my play through as Claire (hard difficulty) and it was glorious. Me likey. Production value is definitely up from the first Revelations title, but still a step away from the main AAA RE installments, but it still looks and feels great. However, I wish that there were more melee options. If only it had RE5's melee gameplay, where there's different melee animations depending on how the enemy is staggered.\nSo far, I am impressed with the first episode, hopefully, I will continue to be with the other subsequent episodes to come. I just hope the story doesn't turn out to be some crazy plot like Revelations 1...\n\nRaid Mode\nIf you were like I, and wasn't much fond of Raid Mode in Revelations 1, I think you'll really like this new Raid Mode in Revelations 2. Now it doesn't seem like a chore to play. Matches are just right in length, much more customization options to make you come back for more. It seems like the roster is going to be quite robust. It would be nice if pretty much all the RE characters were to be included. We already know Leon, Chris will be. I'm hoping for at least Sherry, Ada, Rebecca, and Jessica. They have to include Sherry because Claire is there...wouldn't it be nice?\n\nCons\n-Bug, bugs everywhere! Campaign seems to be alright, for the most part. but there are instances of really bad stuttering and frame rate drops, and lip sync issues (most notably the first real time cutscene in Barry's campaign). After the first patch, it has gotten slightly better for me, but definitely still there. I am running an i7-3770K, 16GB ram, R9 290, and I get areas of 30~ish fps especially when there are effects on the screen (snow, fire, hard lighting). Most I've seen come from raid mode, possibly because of the variations in environment/stages that bring these issues up.\n-Slow mo. I feel like my character seems to be running in slow mo at times, especially during reloads animations. I'm not sure if it's due to the stuttering/fps issue.\n-When aiming, sometimes the thing that you're aiming at is slightly out of focus, and also the laser sight as well. Other times it's fine. Also not liking how the character is also out of focus/slightly fuzzy when aiming as well. Really reminds me of RE6 when it first came out too. If they fixed it for RE6, why implement it in Revelations 2?\n-Enemy AI can be really stupid sometimes. They can get stuck in doorways or window sills or run in circles trying to get to you on another level but have no idea that the stairs is just behind them (experienced in raid mode). Had an enemy just turn around and walk into those spinning spike traps during the campaign when Claire was at the door way, crouched and slightly out of view from it. It kept on walking into the wall next to the door way, gave up and committed suicide.\n\nEven with these cons, it doesn't render the game unplayable. Yes, I know there's those out there where the bugs do render the game unplayable for them, and that's quite unfortunate. But for me, it's just something I'll have to live with until a patch comes out that fixes everything, which I'm pretty confident that Capcom will do, since the first patch rolled out two days after release. However, it does leave a sour taste in one's mouth, especially for PC gamers when the game is not properly ported/optimized.","March 2, 2015","true","134.1"," 218 of 281 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","218","281","7","0"

The controls are fluid, the asymetric team gameplay is enjoyable, while the dodging mechanics from the previous Revelations is vastly improved!\nIf you are fan of the older Resident Evil games and disillusioned by the recent entries in the series, Revelations 2 might just change your opinion and give you some hope for the future of the Resident Evil franchise!\n\nLong review based on the full experience of the complete season\nStory The story is pretty good, and unlike Revelations 1 it actually leads somewhere. With a terrible pun, you could say there's a revelation actually. The events of Revelations 2 take place on an unnamed island where Claire and Moira are kidnapped and exposed to horrific experiments by an unknown antagonist, while months later Barry finally locates the island and begins his search for his missing duo, accompanied by a mysterious girl named Natalia.  The idea of retracing the events of the past is kind of unique, and the plot twists at the end of each episode manage to keep up interest to the very end. The new character cast is interesting and enjoyable, especially Natalia. Even Moira is likeable despite her terribly written lines. However the highlight of the story for me was the interaction between Barry and Natalia.\n\nGameplay and atmosphere Since we are talking about a survival horror game the first thing I should start with is the atmosphere. The game isn't scary at all and there aren't many jump scares either. But is that a bad thing? Well if you want a game that scares the living hell out of you then probably this isn’t the one you should get, however despite that, it's a very atmospheric game, with plenty of details. Each chapter during Claire's segment of the episode you walk through a set location, while playing Barry’s portion of the episode you revisit them. It might sounds kind of lame, that Capcom just recycle the same locations, but it actually works pretty well. All locations go through major changes due to the 6 months difference between the story of Claire and Barry: some routes are blocked away, some paths are opened up. They are the same locations yet they feel and play quite different. The enemy line-up is also different, however there's one small detail I really liked: in Claire's campaign the enemies are lively, mutated humans but in Barry's campaign those same enemies are rotting corpses since several months have passed. It is indeed a small detail but it was a nice addition for the atmosphere.\nThe research notes and survivor letters scattered throughout the game also shed some light on the events of the story.\nThe focus of the game is survival (unlike recent RE entries) as the supplies are limited and your characters are quite vulnerable. The game doesn’t have many enemies, however they are very well placed, and hit pretty hard. There’s a heavy emphasis on utilizing every character’s abilities in order to progress: Claire and Barry are the weapons experts, while Moira and Natalia play as support, helping you open up otherwise unreachable paths, locating hidden items and stun enemies. It is basicly asymmetric team gameplay done right. The AI is certainly not the best, however the support characters have regenerating health, so you don’t really need to worry about them. They can mess up terribly sometimes, by not following orders, but it doesn’t happen often!\nPuzzle elements return, but they are mostly rather simple ones and there’s plenty of fetch-styled puzzles as well. They are not too bad, but some of them were just awkward and out of place.\n\nOverall the gameplay offers solid gunplay and smart team management mechanics allowing you to switch between characters. The controls from the previous Revelations are improved and the revamped evade mechanics works perfect!\n\nProduction value (graphics, sounds, animations etc) Despite he game is supposedly a budget release, I would say it is quite decent. The graphics are certainly not the best, but the game looks nice enough (minus the film grain effect, which can be rather annoying in dark indoor areas) and the lighting effects are particularly well done.\n\nWhere the smaller budget shows however is how the animations were done, there are plenty of clipping, and some of the animations look sloppily executed. (Enemies spawning in front of you and the hitboxes are pretty inaccurate: you get grabbed even though the enemy attack animation isn't finished just to name a few of the problems)\nMusic was enjoyable, though aside from two tracks (escape theme and EP3 boss fight), I wouldn't say the soundtrack was memorable.\n\nAs for the voice acting, it was good. Many expressed their disappointment that Alyson Court didn’t return as Claire, but I must say the new actress was doing well, aside some oddly delivered lines. Barry’s and Natalia’s voice actors were great and the interaction between them felt natural. The weakest voice was probably Moira’s but I blame it on her horribly written lines. Every time she spoke it just felt….wrong.\n\nLength and replay value The length of the game is fairly short, so with an average pace you can finish the story on your first playthrough in about 8 hours. Despite the main campaign being short there's plenty of replay value thanks to Countdown and Invisible modes. Both are challenging in their own way. There are plenty of unlockables ranging from Secret files which add more depth to story, secret weapons (such as the Chicago Typewritter, a katana and even silly ones like the Bubble gun, just to name a few) and the usual figurines and concept art. Also good news for those who were missing Claire's biker suit and Barry's STARS outfit that they can be unlocked as well for finishing the story under certain conditions!\n\nPC port The initial release was a horrible mess, but as of March 19. Capcom adressed most of the performance issues, such as framerate drops, stutterings and crashes for both story and raid mode.\n\nPROS- Interesting story\n- Excellent atmosphere focusing on building tension rather than mindless action\n- Gameplay finally resembles old school Survival horror\n- Solid team-management mechanics, which also add a new layer to environment puzzles\n- Creature designs are decent\n- High replay value thanks to several extra modes for the main campaign and Raid mode.\n- Cheesy one-liners and references to Resident Evil 1's Barry moments\n\nCONS- Animations could have used more polishing.\n- Lots of pixel clipping.\n- The annoying mouse shaking QTE is back!\n- Short campaign","March 19, 2015","true","72.1"," 108 of 132 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","108","132","4","13"

Kennedy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KennedyLeon/","2064 products in account","Why didn't I write a review sooner? I was too damn busy playing this game, that's why.\nResident Evil Revelations 2 takes the original Resident Evil Revelations as a base and keeps what is important intact while adding more features and improving existing ones. As far as the story goes, you will be on the edge of your seat and guessing every episode, definitely the best story that a Resident Evil game has been graced with, and I gotta say they are always pretty good. Most importantly, this title manages to appeal to both new and old fans alike with its modern gameplay and true horror aspect.\n\nThe new episodic structure and the low price point is pleasant addition. Buy the first episode and you get access to all the games features and a dozen of hours of gameplay value. Try out everything and if you enjoy it, buy more, if not then don't. Simple. Plus if you bought the first episode, you get a discount on the Complete Season, so you still can buy the full package and get the bonuses without needing to buy every episode individually.\n\nThe gameplay remains largely the same from the original Resident Evil Revelations with the addition of better gameplay features, like dodges at will. Other than gameplay improvements, the game offers immense amounts of replay value with numerous difficulties and additional gameplay modes for the 4 chapter campaign with the most amount of unlockable rewards ever seen in a Resident Evil game. Upgradable skills and challenges (in addition to the usual achievements) will keep you coming back again and again trying to get that 100% completion.\n\nWhat would a Resident Evil game be without an extra mode, in this case Raid Mode that debuted in the original Revelations returns much better than before with such additions as customizable skills, new guns and parts, new gameplay improvements like upgrading parts, triple the ammount of stages, more difficulties and individual levels for each character. An important thing to note is that locations, guns and enemies from previous Resident Evil games make an appearance in this mode which any fan of the series will know to appreciate. This is also the first time that Chris, Jill, Claire and Leon appear in the same game, meaning that anyone can play as their favorite character in this addicting game mode that gives longtime The Mercenaries mode a run for its money.\n\nLast but not least, the completely free RE.NET (residentevil.net) with weekly and monthly events ensures that there is always something new to be done in the game. The improvements that launched with the release of Resident Evil Revelations 2 have made the RE.NET service better than ever before, giving players a place to compete, get rewarded and talk to other fans.\n\nAll in all, despite the technical problems in early release, which are now completely resolved, the game is a solid 10.\n\nMy new favorite Resident Evil game of all time.","May 30, 2015","true","261.3"," 104 of 129 people (81%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","81","104","129","13","14"

There isn't enough ammo to kill everything without using your support character correctly and there is a lot of synergy between the main and support characters.\n2. The story has been interesting and well paced so far.\n3. The skill system is interesting (lots of choices).\n4. You feel helpess at times of low ammunition (which happens quite often).\n5. The stealth mechanic is fantastic, but you can't use it all the time due to line of sight or positioning.\n6. Playing the support in campaign doesn't suck! you can still get involved with combat and you can set your partner up for powerful finishers (or vice-versa).\n7. Nice amount of varied upgrades, although more variety in raid mode.\n8. The setting is very atmospheric and does give you a genuine tingle down your spine at some points.\n9. There are plenty of classic RE 'jump' moments, but there have also been nice buildups and some genuine 'are you sure this isn't Silent Hill?' moments.\n10. The game has so far lived up to what was promised by the devs and I'm actually getting excited waiting for the next episode to be launched!\n11. Mouse and KB support are fantastic at least on par (if not better) with RE 6/Revelations 1.\n12. NO QTE!\n13. NO WESKER!\n14. There is a lot of variety as you progress, it doesn't get repetative and in some cases there are mutliple ways of approaching things, you could do it stealthy, you could go in John Woo style or you can utilise your partner and chain up some combos/follow ups/finishers. Obviously some situations force you to chose one style but the choice is very nice.\n\nCons:\n1. Being able to restart from check points makes death not so scary.\n2. It's very difficult to complete the campaign on hard without any skills, seems more like you're meant to complete it on normal first, then play hard with most of the skills unlocked.\n3. The AI support character won't find items by itself, forcing you to switch to them every time you enter a new room, wasting time (and lowering your final score).\n4. The lockpicking controls are biased towards a controller.\n5. The controller layouts are terrible (RE6 or a broken RE4 layout) and there is no custom setting.\n6. Occasional stutters in fps (although Fraps and Gamecaster were showing over 100 fps).\n7. Barry now appears to be John McClaine, complete with divorce/broken daughter relationship, grissled looks, bad jokes and a strong bond with the support character (who happens to remind him of his youngest daughter Polly).\n\nI've not played much of the raid mode yet but from what I can see it's more for the action-horror fans of the series, think RE6 but without trying to add a proper story to it! The progression system seems insanely grindy (you gotta be over lvl 92 for everything to be available), there are a lot of different guns, mods, etc and there is a reasonable variety of levels but each episode is adding more content for raid mode so I can only imagine it getting better.","March 10, 2015","true","23.6"," 112 of 148 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","112","148","10","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/acantophis3rd/recommended/287290/","acantophis3rd","Acantophis3rD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/acantophis3rd/","133 products in account","Updated 02/19/2015 after Patch 2.1\nThe latest patch removes every framerate drops and stuttering for the majority of people. I begin the review by telling you what canged in comparison to the games previous performance.\n\nPerformance\nFramerate drops are completely gone from the game. It should now sit on constant 60FPS on max quality setting (even for hardware compareable to minimum systemrequirements). There is still some stutter at the beginning of some Raid-Mode stages and during the Story-Mode when large areas are loaded. But after that the game runs flawlesly. There are still some issues with infinite uploading & casual Raid-Mode crashes for some people. If you waited for the performance to be fixed before buying the game, then now is the time to buy it without regret!\n\nStory-Mode & Gameplay\nYou play Claire Redfield & Barry Burton’s Daughter Moira. You get kidnaped and wake up in a prison cell with a bracelet around your arms that change colour in response to fear. Now it’s on you to escape the place and to find out who did this to you. The all so ever faithful co-op partner system of modern Resident Evil games is in play here.\n\nYou can switch characters on the fly to solve puzzles, organize your inventory and defeat monsters. Unlike previous games only one of the two characters (Claire) will use weapons, the other one (Moira) uses a flashlight to blind enemies to beat them up with her crowbar or to have Claire take them out with brute firepower. Moira’s flashlight can also detect hidden items in the vicinity by shining the light on it. In between episodes, you can unlock special abilities for use in the campaign with Bonus Points (collected as gemstones ingame) to make it easier for you to survive the horror.\n\nIn the second half of each of the four story-campaigns you play as the man Barry Burton himself that came to the place to rescue his daughter Moira. He soon meets a small girl (Natalia) that can sense enemies in the environment for Barry to plan his next move. You might think Barry’s part is a pure shooting gallery, but it’s not. Preparation and planning is as important to survive in the Barry/Natalia part of the story as it is for Claire & Moira.\n\nAdditional Modes can be unlocked after finishing the episodes. Including a Countdown (Speedrun) & Invisible Enemy Mode in which partner swapping is a must to survive. There is actuall a ton of unlockables & achievments besides the usual Secret Documents, Figures, Artworks to unlock.\n\nBut don’t expect any unique gameplay elements here. Revelations 2 recycles & uses many elements you already found in countless other games of the last 2 years. If you take a closer look you will realize (mostly series veterans) that Capcom seemed to have put together all the good and sometimes bad things from previous games in the series. But you will be glad to find out that the good things overweight. Revelations 2 is a high quality entry of the franchise. Capcom abandoned the action firework style of Resident Evil 6 and created a very atmospheric, sometimes creepy game. Will it scare you? Maybe. But don’t count on that. It’s far from being Resident Evil Remake.\n\nRaid-Mode\nThere might be lots to unlock in the story campaign that can bind players for countless hours & gives completionists a reason to continue playing. But it’s nothing compared to the second incarnation of Revelation 1’s Raid-Mode.\n\nYou pick from a decent amount of characters that all start from level 1. You then enter the first of up to 200 stages. You will shoot monsters, gather experience & gold. You will loot weapons & weapon modifications. You will finish the stage with up to 5 medals rewarded for sticking to certain requirements and level up the character you used.\nWeapons & modifications can then be kept or sold for gold which you then use to buy new equipment in a store. Experience points can be spend on various active & passive skills to strengthen the character. But you want more loot, more gold & more experience: So you start the second stage and keep on going until your character is level 100.\n\nLevel 100 is only the beginning. You keep on playing for more weapons, more skillpoints, gold & modifications. You might even try to use other characters to find out what their special abilities, advantages & disadvantages are. Skills of characters can be unlocked for other characters to use. Sooner or later you will realize that you are addicted! That’s Raid Mode in a nutshell.\n\nConclusion\nWhy do I recommend the game? Well, mostly for Raid-Mode. Raid-Mode alone is worth the $6 for Episode 1, even though you don’t get all characters, weapons & stages. But you will always have the ability to upgrade to the entire set for $25 for more of it or $40 for everything (including DLC you would need to buy if you get the package for $25).\nRevelations 2 features an interesting & compelling Story-Mode with well written storyline & cliffhangers that keep you guessing.","March 16, 2015","true","274.5"," 73 of 100 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","73","100","2","0"

Which I had to look up (2005) ♥♥♥♥ I'm old.\n\nAnyways, I really like this game! I wasn't expecting much from it honestly. The co-op that isn't co-op threw me for a loop (although you can play it in real co-op) I've never gotten along with myself so well.\n\nYou play as either Claire Redfield and Moira Burton or Barry Burton and Natalia Korda.. Each taking on similar roles. Claire and Barry are sort of the damage dealers, the arsenal, the defender. While Moira and Natalia take on a more passive role. Moira has a flashlight that can be focused not unlike Alan Wake might do to temporarily stun enemies. Natalia has a more subtle and possibly supernatural ability in which she can possibly smell the enemies even through walls. Additionally she can see the weak spots that are hidden on certain enemies. Moira and Natalia both use melee weapons as a primary attack different from their partners. This allows for what are essentially stomp attacks or finishing moves on downed enemies.\n\nThe game is broken into episodes of varying length. Mostly around 2 hours each. The third seemingly longer than the others. There are also some bonus episodes that take place 'during' the main campaign but were skipped, likely for pacing reasons. But are enjoyable after the fact.\n\nI had initially worried that Resident Evil had changed too much. Surely someone would force me to stick a gem into socket or place a strange necklace at the foot of a statue of something of the like to unlock a door. And? I was not disappointed.  The puzzles are not difficult by any stretch though they remain satisfying to solve. There are also plenty of jump scares as well. Though there are a number less than I would expect as Natalia is rather up front about her abilities.\n\nSo lets see, the puzzles are the same. What about inventory management? That’s here too, though its not a Tetris game like in 4, just basic blocks that stack on similar items. However you can still definitely play the combine stuff with other junk and pass it in between partners game to make more room for new items.\n\nThere are some really tense sequences that I really enjoyed where the, lets call them the passive partner must climb over obstacles, open a gate while being swarmed and the, lets call them the more aggressively minded partner is forced to protect them while they clear the obstacle in the others way. I played this single player and found the moments very engaging. The AI did not get in the way and in fact upon upgrading some abilities became very reliable.\n\nSpeaking of upgrades, aside from gun parts found throughout the environments which can be applied to your weapons at an upgrade bench. You also earn a currency called BP which can be used in between episodes to upgrade things like distance traveled over an evade or effectiveness of focusing Moira's flashlight.\n\nThere is also a RAID mode, which more or less is a horde mode. Which has everything you'd expect it to have. Multiple characters, leveling of those characters, different guns, all sorts of unlocks, and different outfits. I may sound dismissive of this mode, its great, especially for the amount of gameplay it grants you for the price. I just don't find it particularly engaging long term but its certainly worth a few rounds.\n\nI rather enjoyed this game and its gotten me back into Resident Evil as a whole. Even horror games in general, I guess this is more action. All games are sort of survival. Hmm, it seems I've derailed again. This is a really fun game. Try the first episode if your skeptical. I don't think you'll be disappointed.","November 1, 2015","true","14.4"," 70 of 99 people (71%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","71","70","99","11","2"

Aiming is fast and intuitive. Switching characters with a quick press of the Tab key is great.\n\nThe other BIG, MAJOR issue I have is the lack of any option for Co-Op for the campaign... Neither offline or Online Coop is available for the campaign mode. According to Capcom, they will add online Coop for the Raid mode at a later date.\n\nThis is incredibly dissapointing and frustrating as the console versions featur3e split-screen coop for the campaign. I completely fail to see why capcom decided to exclude this very basic feature.\n\nIt is somewhat understandable in thinking that split-screen coop is not common in PC games... but Steam Boxes are becoming a thing. As well as many people who now play on 27" Monitors and above.\n\nIf you are looking to only play the game as a single player experience... then once they fix some of the wierd technical issues with the frame-dropping, I can more readily recommend the game. Even with the issue, it's not game breaking and might be okay for most people...\n\nBut otherwise, I recommend buying it on console over the PC version... as those versions have more features.\n\nTo Capcom: Please add offline Coop for the campaign... at the VERY LEAST. Perhaps add the ability for a second player to join in with a controller, while the primary player plays with mouse and keyboard. Online or Local Network Coop would be great too.\n\nJust do anything to add CooP for the campaign on the PC version in some form or another and I'll be satisfied.\n\n","February 25, 2015","false","5.0"," 167 of 260 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","167","260","8","1"

I really hope that I could convince you to buy this awesome game, and also experience it.\n\nResident Evil: Revelations 2 is a sequel, follow up from the first RE: Revelations, there are 4 episodes that are quite long, and provide good amount of playtime. Also the campaign has some replayability as well, since there's a skill tree that you're supposed to level up with many different skills. You won't get all of the skills unlocked on the 1st playthrough of course, but that encourages you to play through the campaign a 2nd time, with a harder difficulty of course, which provides a new challenge.\n\nSADLY the campaign doesn't have an online CO-OP, but it does have a local coop. The campaign has always 2 characters, the other character will be controlled by an AI, if not played coop locally. Whilst you will be controlling the "main" character. Altough you can change between these 2 characters in a blink of an eye, and you can make some teamwork happen between these 2 characters because of this very easily.\n\nIf you really think that that's not enough of content for the price you're about to pay for this game... FORTUNATELY there's also a mode that I like really much, which is called the "Raid Mode" which can be played in CO-OP, and it's a blast! Here you also have many characters to play with, that have own unique skills on them, and you have to level up every single character individually, when you level up to a specific point, you will able to replace to an old skill slot or gain more skills slots and equip that skill to your active skill tree. Leveling up happens by completing missions where you have to eliminate a certain amount of enemies while you gather treasures and supplies to survive.\n\nGathering treasures is a very important part of Raid mode since when you open a treasure chest, you get an item. This item could a weapon, or a mod that you can make your weapons better with. These weapons and mods have a range of quality, there's a very basic weapons/mods or a very nice and epic weapons or mods that are a lot more powerful than the basic items.\nYou will end up finding yourself farming these weapons and mods at some point. (:\n\nI really like this game, and it's a different approach than the other Resident Evil's and to be honest. But some of the hardcore fans might say this game sucks because it's not like the first Resident Evil games that were released, I'd say that variety is the spice of life.\n\nGive it a try, and buy the "Box Set" to get the most content out of it.","August 9, 2015","true","8.7"," 68 of 98 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","68","98","5","12"

The same bugs present in RE HD remake are the same bugs in Resident Evil Revelations 2, from the mouse cursor stuck on the screen when using a controller to the game disabling the computers volume control.\n\nCapcom worked hard on RE6 polishing it to work on PC at launch with few to no bugs to get their reputation back in the PC community since the disaster that originally was RE4 on PC.  Their street cred today is trashed on PC once again.  Past remakes like RE4 were handled by outside studios and done very well with regular updates compared to the titles actually made in house at Capcom.  Outside companies make better RE games than Capcom that are less buggy, that is just sad for our beloved Capcom.\n\nRev2 is plagued with bugs to stuttering and even an in game cash shop implemented in the worst way.  Every time you die in raid mode your greeted with a popup asking to buy crystals to revive.  Storage space for items requires buying it via dlc.  These are things that could have been easily included.  Imagine if in Skyrim for each additional backpack slot you had to buy it with an in game cash shop.   That strategy is fine for a F2P game but not a retail game that people already bought.    The raid mode is nothing new at all, its just sections from RE6 with monsters, that is all it is.  So if a person owns RE6 they basically dont even need this game.  Its really the same as any advertising, if there is a ad banner on a webpage we dont have to click it. if we see a coke commercial on TV we dont have to go buy coke, its optional. Same in this game, an ad pops up advertising their life crystals to continue a basic feature in any other game EVERY TIME you die in raid mode.\nSome claim the popups are not ads just an option. "Optional the choice of a new generation!"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lgLYGBbDNs\n\nRevelations 2 introduces a new way of collecting item.  This item when collected while playing the game BLOCKS the entire screen with a popup telling you about the item.  No pausing the game or anything you could have monsters ready to attack but here is this attention ho of an item taking up the entire screen.  Albums are so selfish, but their not done yet hogging the spotlight.  At the end of every match again each album takes up an entire screen to get more attention that you have to click through.  If that isnt enough the album still isnt yours, oh no we got a long way to go before you can use that item you found way back in the game.  Now you go to a "jukebox", select the album then confirm the selection then you must see the item then you go to your character where you can finally equip the item.  What a selfish item.  Nukes can be launched using launch codes with less steps then it takes to obtain and use an album.  And if that isnt enough you have to go through that entire process for each album individually, and there are 3-4 per raid.\nHow most gamers feel about the inividual who implemented the current version of the album feature in the game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rc6mr8zjEE\n\nThe short stories are very good, worth picking up the set.   Fun characters like fan favorite Beary are finally playable which is nice.  New characters like Moira are awesome.  Jill known for her short skirt and devil may care attitude was the ridiculous character who for no reason looked like a super model in a  zombie apocalypse, its what made the game cheesy in that fun way.  In this game her character model looks like one of those after pics from meth addiction or any average peasant in skyrim.  This is odd because her looks originally came from a digital scan of real life model and now world famous actress Julia Voth who is not only awesome for being the voice and face of Jill but also as Trixie in the cinematic masterpiece that revolutionized modern film making known as ♥♥♥♥♥Slap, which is known among many circles as one of the greatest movies ever made.  Anyone who hasnt seen ♥♥♥♥♥ Slap needs to party on and hasnt lived and needs to complete their life by putting it on their bucket list.\n\n(This abomination of a game will become a -1million/10 if ANY boss or sub boss is a gelatinous cube.)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4tmzwrdTmY\nRE fans:  8/10  Value: 19.99\nNon RE fans:  4/10  Value:  $9.99","February 27, 2015","false","98.1"," 140 of 227 people (62%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","62","140","227","12","10"

I didn't have the highest hopes, but I was also really looking forward to playing it. The episodic release provided a nice structure to give me a chance to come up with my own theories about what was going on, while remaining spoiler-free. It was fantastic to experience the story as it unfolded. If you're a big fan of past Resident Evil games, you'll recognize a ton of references scattered throughout the game, paying a nice homage to the game's predecessors and making some ties to previous games in the series that you might not have expected. The game does a great job at connecting other games in the franchise with in-game dialogue, text files, and secret unlockable files - and I've still just scratched the surface on those.\n\nIf you do compare it to Revelations 1, or if you have played that game and are on the fence about this one: the only thing I really can say is that Revelations 2 achieves everything that Revelations 1 did not. The story presentation, dialogue, and writing were all phenomenal. The voice direction worked beautifully. It really feels like with this game, the spinoff series could very well be a successful standalone experience.\n\nFor extra content - there are two bonus episodes (campaign), as well as three difficulties for the normal campaign, and two separate bonus campaign modes: Countdown, where you race against the clock, earning bonus time as you progress through the episode; and Invisible Enemy, a throwback to REmake where the enemies you face are all invisible, until revealed by Natalia or Moira's support abilities, or when you successfully attack them. On top of that, Raid Mode makes a very big return with a vastly improved structure, the introduction of Skills, and over 140 stages, featuring familiar enemies from other recent Resident Evil titles. There's also a nice cast of playable characters, all with their own unique skill-sets, and they each add their own kind of variation to the way you can play the game to keep things interesting in the long haul.\n\nThis game gets a huge thumbs up from me.","March 17, 2015","true","136.2"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","36","49","0","0"

The return of Barry Burton and Claire Redfield deserves a big thumbs up to Capcom. The old B-movie like story is back with an interesting antagonist, which some fans have been waiting for. The game has a lot of self-awareness, making quotes now and then that fans will remember, like: "I was almost a Claire sandwich" or "Who's the master of unlocking now?".\n\nStory Claire Redfield works at an anti-terrorist organization called Terrasave. Barry Burton's daughter Moira recently joined Terrasave. Terrasave is hosting a party, which gets crashed by mysterious mercenaries, and injects everyone with something. Claire wakes up in a cell in an unknown location. Shortly after she finds Moira also locked in a cell. Both are wearing strange bracelets through where a mysterious woman is speaking, quoting poetry and giving instructions. Claire and Moira must find out where they are, who this woman is that is speaking to them, and how to get away from this place.\n\nGameplay The gameplay is very similar to Revelations, over the shoulder third person action, with a little bit of survival horror here and there. scarce ammunition and though enemies make for some tense moments. Next to Claire Redfield and Moira Burton, you will also be able to play as Barry Burton accompanied by a girl named Natalia. The game uses an episodic structure in which you play a part of Claire's story and a part of Barry's story. Side characters like Moira and Natalia won't use guns, but have another special ability. Moira has a flashlight, which she can use to slow enemies down and stun them. Natalia in Barry's campaign has the ability to spot enemies from a distance and through walls. This is useful for Barry to easily sneak kill the enemies. The main campaign has a big focus on story, and a fine mystery to solve, but the gameplay is much like every recent Resident Evil game. The place where the gameplay really shines though is at..\n\nThe Raid Mode The raid mode is back from Revelations, and better than ever. More characters and more stages to play makes for a very fun experience.  Many unlockables and special weapons to achieve makes the new raid mode very, very addictive. Many critics have praised the raid mode in Revelations 2, it's like a little RPG hidden in the game. for those of you who are not familiar with the raid mode. Raid mode has you run through an area, killing enemies with your selected character and loadout. You can achieve medals in each of the stages to get a higher score. At the end of the stages you'll be rewarded XP to level your character and improve in your skills. The raid mode in Revelations 2 is very addictive and fun, and might even be worth the price alone.\n\nThe PC launch After all the praise I gave the game, I can't help but say that the pc launch of this game was horrible. A very bad port from the start with huge performance issues, which has been fixed a few days ago. My pc can run almost every new game on ultra, and I couldn't play this game on low without huge fps drops. Luckily this has all been fixed now, making it possible to play this game on ultra fluidly. I can barely forgive Capcom for this horrible launch, but after all the fixes, i can't help but say that this game is actually very, very good.\n\nConclusion With a horrible launch, Resident Evil Revelations 2 got a lot of dislike thrown towards it. Now that all the episodes are released and most of the bugs fixed, this game became a solid entry in the Resident Evil series. The return of Claire and Barry is a true love letter to fans, and the cheasy B-movie style story like we all love from Resident Evil is back big time. The addictive Raid mode would be worth the game alone, but the main campaign is a lot of fun, and might be one of the best Resident Evil games since a long time.\n\n8.7/10","March 21, 2015","true","28.7"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","26","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CounterLife/recommended/287290/","CounterLife","« Counter-Life™ »","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CounterLife/","98 products in account","Serious review time.\n\nThis game is pretty good. It's not phenomenal, but better than RE6.\n\nFirst things first though, this game does have some drawbacks.\nFirstly, there's no online co-op for the campaign. I don't know why they thought that would be a good idea, especially since you can play Raid mode with others online.\nSecondly, it's not exactly a great console port. If you run on a non-mainstream resolution you will most likely end up with a black screen, which can only be fixed by dinking around with the config file.\nThe aiming feels very weird when moving the mouse fast, this is due to the fact that this game uses joystick emulation (for whatever reason).\nAlso, a huge part of the game's graphics are getting rendered using your CPU instead of the GPU. Again, you can blame the fact that this is a port for that.\n\nAs you can see this port isn't too great from a technical standpoint, now that we got that out of the way, let's move on to the actual game.\n\nThis game takes place between RE5 and 6, you play as Claire, Barry and two other (more or less) new support characters. The game's pretty straight forward, you get a cheesy 3 minute intro and then the horror begins. Interesting is that Barry's campaign takes place 6 months after Claire's campaign. The actions you take in Claire's campaign might affect Barry's later on, similar to the zapping system in RE2. I won't talk much further about the plot, since it would just spoil things. Just saying this, the plot isn't exactly overwhelmingly good.\n\nThe graphics are okay, they are not great, but get the job done. The enviroments feel quite natural and fairly believable. Animations look smooth, although I would like to mention that both male and female characters have the same basic animation set, which makes movement look weird from time to time.\n\nGameplay is really great, unlike RE6, this game isn't a massive explosion/action fest. We actually get to feel some survival horror again. Your health won't regenerate by itself (except for the last 10 HP or so) and ammunition is quite rare, making stealth kills and evasions much more relevant. Enemies won't drop any items whatsoever, so it's encouraged to avoid enemies or (if you are forced to) shoot the enemie's weak spot.\nEach campaign has two playable characters, Claire + Moira & Barry + Natalia.\nThey all have their personal strenghts and weaknesses, so working together is encouraged aswell. However, at some points it feels like the support character is just there to loot the hidden items, at other times it actually feels useful.\nGunplay and movement feel very good. Your guns have actual recoil (unlike RE6's crosshair jumping thingy) and can be upgraded with parts that you can find (just like in the first Revelations) throughout the levels.\nYou can trigger an evasion animation at (almost) any time, use your knife in close quarters, and hit stunned enemies with a melee move. The melee system has been simplified. Unlike in RE5, you can only stun enemies with headshots, and each character only has two melee moves (head stun and ground finisher). I would have appreciated RE5's melee system here, as I think it has a good balance between action and gameplay balance.\n\nThe level design is engaging. Often you'll need keys or other key items (like gears) to move on. This combined with the scarcity and the interesting, soviet looking enviroment makes for fun gameplay.\n\nNow for the thing that will (probably) be one of the main reasons for you to buy this game.\n\nRaid Mode.\n\nThis mode can be addicting, while not flawless, it has a great variety of characters, weapons and skills, that will take hundreds of hours to unlock and master.\nYou'll start off with a level 1 character, as you play through stages, kill enemies, loot items and gain medals, your character will eventually level up and you will gain better parts, skills and weapons to upgrade.\nYou can upgrade weapons with parts similar to the ones in the campaign. This gamemode reminds me a bit of VR mode from the Metal Gear Solid games. It's gameplay focused, and has a somewhat arcade-ish feel to it.\nHowever, it also comes with a few flaws.\nMost stages are just modified stages from RE6. If you've played that game, you'll recognize alot of locations from RE6, a few from Revelations and the game's main campaign. Actually, I'm not sure if there's even a single original stage.\nIt also becomes unchallenging at some point. Throughout Raid Mode, you'll gain better guns, parts and skills, all these combined with a small bit of gamesense will make you unstoppable even on the highest difficulty. Maybe a dynamic spawn system and less powerful assets would have made for a more challenging experience.\n\nOverall I really like this game. It's a step into the right direction, and I hope Capcom will make a full-fledged Resident Evil game that is similar to this one, but improves on the weakpoints.\n\nFinal verdict: 7.8/10","March 13","true","129.2"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","25","32","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vincent-010/recommended/287290/","Vincent-010","Mr.Ducky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vincent-010/","159 products in account","This game is a little bittersweet for me. But it also lends hope for the series.\nI should start off by saying I really enjoyed RE:REV1. It had, at least for me, good horror, rewarding gameplay, and replayability. Both of the Revelations games are a stark departure from the usual RE formula, and Revelations 2 departs from its predecessor just as much. Returning themes are the gun customizations and BP. That’s ... about it I think.\n\nI've played through the first two episodes so far and impressions are a little mixed. We'll start with the pros for those without much patience;\n- Claire looks like an ACTUAL women. REV1 was mostly you staring at the tight ♥♥♥ of Jill from third person. Fan service, really. But Claire is realistic and I like her much more for that.\n- You get about 2 hours of gameplay for 6 bucks. I think that's fine for just one play through.\n- If you grew up with this series or played and liked the original REs, there are a few references and fan services for you. Including sandwiches.\n-Scavenging is key. I thoroughly enjoyed the Metro series for it's rewarding scavenging and REV2 usually delivers on that.\n- I like the split story telling between the two groups. And each side has their own sort of style of gameplay. Both are potentially fun for me.\n- Aside from the film grain, the game looks really good. It's more of a gritty and realistic take. Through, I have preferred to sort of style that RE4 and 5 had graphics wise.\n- I just can't seem to get enough of Barry's voice actor ... or Barry himself for that matter.\n-It seems like Revelations is becoming REs proving grounds to experiment. That lends a lot of hope for the atrocity that was RE6. I enjoyed RE6 a lot, actually, but it was a huge let down from RE. If REV2 didn't have the RE name, I would be fooled in to thinking it's an entirely different franchise. It seems to take a lot of inspiration from The Evil Within and even the Metro series. The enemies and settings really remind me of The Evil Within and I'm pretty sure one of the earlier heavy enemies is a subtle reference to Pyramid Head. I hope they go on to maintain a sort of main series and then a sub series in the Revelations' vein. That way if they want to cram as much Quintin Tarentino-y action in to a game as they can like in RE6, the rest of us can still enjoy a sub series.\n- Adding on to the previous point, this game is cheap. Despite having the small price tag, this is a full game. Like I said, this is probably their place to experiment and the lower price tag sends me the message that they understand this isn't meant to a super Triple A game. It's a side story to add on to the series. So with that lower expectation I was left marginally surprised, in a good way.\n\nAnd now for the cons;\n- Killing enemies no longer gives you ammo. This is practically a deal breaker for me. One of the things I loved most about RE4,5, and REV1 was that I could wean ammo from enemies. I liked playing through once with difficulty, then playing through a few more times to grind ammo and just enjoy having that surplus to get my revenge on the harder bosses or enemies. You might sort of do this in Raid Mode but it's just not the same for me.\n- There is an incredibly annoying film grain overlay. The Evil Within also had this and I hate it here just as much as I did there. I can't seem to find an option to turn it off, unfortunately. I'm sure they thought this would add to the ambiance but it just becomes distracting. Some may like it and many probably won't notice it as much as I do, though.\n- This game acts like a very half ♥♥♥♥♥ console port. Enemy path-finding AIs get tripped up, a few graphical bugs, desynced audio on some cutscenes. and unresponsive partners (Very reminiscent of Sheva) really break any immersion you manage to achieve.\n- This might be because I'm bad shot and play with a gampad (I usually don't use controllers), but the game can sometimes go beyond hectic and just become unfair or annoying. Ammo never seems to last or be enough. In my experience, I seemed to run out of ammo at the worst possible times. But, again, could just be me.\n- I'm not too sure I like the episodic format. This is just personal taste. On the bright side, if you are very short on cash you can spread the cost of the game out and it does a good job of bringing you back for the next episode. And, you could just wait until all the episodes are out, buy the bundle, and play it all through.\n\nAll in all you can only end up wasting 6 bucks if you give the first episode a try. And despite the quirks it has, I've ended up liking it. It's a pretty innocuous investment and if you like it you can get the other episodes when they come out or just wait until they're all out and buy the bundle.","March 6, 2015","true","7.3"," 40 of 62 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","40","62","2","0"

That said, I still have complaints, most notably the microtransactions present for Raid Mode, but that aside, the game is quite good. I am also still unsatisfied with how long it took before multiplayer was implemented (still waiting on multiplayer for the campaign), and the fact that the game was released episodically. That said, at least we now have everything here, which is great. Capcom has also fixed a lot of the FPS, stuttering, and crashes which plagued me on release, so bonus points there too.\n\nA pretty big fan of Resident Evil, if not all Horror games, I greatly enjoyed the gameplay and setting of Resident Evil Revelations. It was good to see the return of Barry and Claire, though I wouldn't have minded seeing more Jill and Ada. Staying true to its history of strong co-op elements, Revelations 2 builds upon this extensively. Whereas in previous Resident Evil games, including the first Revelations, you merely fought with 2 characters, in this one, co-operation between your two characters (Claire and Moira, and Barry and Natalia) is paramount, and the different mechanics of the two characters and how they interact is the standout feature of this game. Forcing you to switch between the two to progress, and with a slew of now customary puzzles, the campaign is solid. But it is in Raid Mode that Revelations 2 truly shines. Having greatly enjoyed the freedom provided by Raid Mode in the first Revelations, I eagerly anticipated the second iteration, and once I could finally play it, I was not disappointed (except for the microtransactions). Great fun, and with multiple characters, weapons, and skills, Raid Mode offers virtually endless replayability. The genuine atmospheric survival horror, and the soundtrack complement the gameplay to produce a worthy addition to the Resident Evil franchise.\n\nIn contrast though, the graphics, particularly of the enemies, looks a bit sub-par. The environments and locations look great... but the enemies... slightly less so. While Raid Mode is the best part of the game, microtransactions included, it is seriously grindy, especially if you want to unlock everything. Each character needs to be leveled up separately, and you, as the player, also have a separate EXP system as well. Then there are the skills and in-game cash you need to acquire too. That said, the game is still great fun.","April 2, 2015","true","14.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","4"

Much better then RE5 and RE6 unless you were looking for a really good coop experience then RE 5 would be better I suppose. As a pure resident evil game its the best since RE4. It is nowhere near as good as RE4 but RE4 is one of my favorite games of all times so thats not really a black mark on this one.\n\nFor the price you get alot of content. There is an absolutly awesome raid mode that you can spend at least 100 hours in just completing all the different missions and it is a ton of fun.\n\nThe single player is also very good. The atmosphere is pretty nice and the enemy designs are cool and creepy. Levels are a bit too linear, but not overly so. Coop is in this game as well though you can only play single player locally and only one person gets to shoot things which is pretty lame imo. The single player will last around 10 - 12 hours but considering you get the raid mode and a beefy single player the 30 price is well worth it for this great game.\n\nFor RE fans this is a must buy.

It's the best new entry in the series in nearly six years and is packed with plenty of content for its very reasonable price tag. The gameplay dials back the ridiculous action focus from RE6 and delivers a few clever puzzles and some genuine tension at times. Progression is still linear and chapter based but the campaign offers a good deal of exploration. Combat (on Survival difficulty) is satisfying and risky, and even the forced co-op is actually designed with single player in mind since it's now more reminiscent of the partner system from RE Zero than RE5 or 6. Hell, the writing and voice acting are unexpectedly great with some truly chuckle-worthy banter and just the right amount of cheese peppered through a fun-and-silly story. There's lots of fan service and even some successful tugs at the heart strings which makes it easier to forgive some of the sloppier characterization on Claire's end (and the very depressing replacement of her voice actress).\n\nThat's not even to mention all of the content and longevity supplied by Raid Mode. It's a clearly budget-made RE and has some roughness on its edges, but Revelations 2 puts its heart in all the right places. The series hasn't yet achieved the mythical "blend of classic and new" Resident Evil yet, but this is the most potent example of it so far.\n\nEDIT: All episodes are now out and with everything on the table, I have to say I like the game even more than when this review was published. A nice optimization patch has helped performance (though it wasn't much of an issue for me beforehand) and the game offers a ton of unlockables and replay value, including multiple endings! Sadly, the less satisfying of these two endings is triggered far too easily and obscurely, but for folks who managed to finish Episode 4 with the good ending will really be in for a memorable treat.\n\nThe bonus episodes aren't crucial selling points, but they are fun hour-ish long diversions that mix up the gameplay mechanics and flesh out some bits of the narrative.\n\nUltimately, even if you just snag the $25 season pass without any additional content you'll more than get your money's worth.","March 14, 2015","true","61.1"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","27","42","0","0"

It won't connect. You either need to have your firewall block the game or disconnect from the internet.\n- PC gamers don't get campaign co-op at all (that we wouldn't get it wasn't mentioned on the Steam store page until shortly before release) and Raid mode online co-op won't be available until the game has the last episode released.

It is much less chaotic, the story makes sense, and makes you more invested in it.\nGameplay is still action based (despite people claiming otherwise), but the different playable characters do give a change of pace and style of gameplay. In both cases though, it is darker and a little bit more scarrier than the latest RE titles that we were given. And that is a step in right direction!\nEpisodic content is a weird marketing choice for me - a RE fan - but perhaps it is a smart move if they want to bring in some new blood. You don't risk much if you buy the first episode, and it's quality may positively surprise you.\n\nI'd give the game 8/10 + I see a lot of potention for Revelations 3 or more episodes. If they were to give us the same quality, I wouldn't hesitate for a second.\nGame is based on RE6 engine, so maybe it has an easier start, because I actually like it more than the RE6.\nI can imagine better graphics, especially some models (the cars...) but most of the stuff looks good enough (especially character models), which you can't say about the old REV1. Bland rooms and corridors are no more, but I wish that I will live long enough to see RE game on Unreal Engine...\n\nAlso keep in mind, that many things have been patched already, with future patches planned, so I hope that the mixed reviews will soon change into positive ones. :)","March 14, 2015","true","83.6"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","30","48","0","5"

Apparently it will be shipped in the future.\n-The guns in this game do not feel like they have any impact. If you play alot of action shooters, you'll know what I mean. The guns just do not have any kick to it. And when you shoot at enemies, they often do not get knocked back. Sometimes it feels like you are shooting a paintball gun.","February 24, 2015","false","1.7"," 60 of 104 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","60","104","5","0"

No time for the main menu then? I suppose you want this ♥♥♥♥ over as fast as possible? Fair enough given the drunken state you are in, Capcom.\nAn immediate escape as soon as I have skipped the cutscenes and I am on the main menu, sorting out what I assumed at the time was just a small misfire on its own part, no big deal but as soon as I am back in the game restarting; more warning bells begin to kick in, the screen tearing is real but what becomes worse is the absolute diabolical level of voice acting and audio work, a party thrown in the honour of TerraSave, that feels completely devoid of life and any enthusiasm, quiping awful lines of dialogue such as "terr... doesn't have to end with ...rist" .... What.. Resident Evil was founded on cheesy dialogue but it had a sense of class and elegance beneathe the full plates of cheese, it was down right campy and we loved it for that but then, enter Claire Redfield.\n\nAddressing the fan-boyism so we can move past this, I just want to say; Alyson Court (The true 'Voice' of Claire Redfield) I am so, so sorry for the complete butchering of a character you made your own, one that you have dedicated your voice talent, heart and soul, to bring to so many gamers over the span of the last eighteen years.\nClaire Redifeld, now, has no passion, no character and no interest in her own voice work to even be compared. This voice actress sounds how wet cardboard looks and is completely devoid of emotion, taking the term 'B-Movie' to new lows.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum however, is the newly introduced, Moira Burton and daughter of "What IS this?" Barry Burton. Two individual voice actors who have all the spark and interest of wanting to get involved with the franchises colourful past and give it their all. Barry & Moira are both well written, brash, spunky, relatable and moreover, an interesting pair of characters to want to get to know. Of the current roster, Moira & Barry Burton are the most grounded and well realised of the plot so far.\n\nEPISODE 1:\nThe presentation and graphics, though appearing dated by todays standards, hold up well once you are in the game and you take control of the characters. Animations are fluid for the most part such as when your character takes heavy damage, they do become visibly more stressed and tired as they will hunch over and clamber for dear life, using a tourniquet if they begin to bleedout all over the screen will ensure survival just long enough for you to see the next green herb, lip syncing however is one major factor that is so HORRIBLY off, they may as well be 5000 yards from one another and hearing distant echos long after the talking stops, much like radio signals travelling through our cosmos.\n\nThe detail of the environments is just the right level of grimey without becoming imposing or vulgar. Environments are generally well rendered, appropriately dim and equally unnerving, allowing RE fans to settle right in based solely on the visual aesthetics that have come to be expected of a Resident Evil title. It begins typically linear as you move through tight, narrow hallways filled with prison cells, medical bays, antiseptic batheing rooms and large trash compactors full of large insects and all kinds of nasty; with some bewildering environmental traps, it is clear to see that architect George Trevor, has had an obvious admirer here at the prison, which clearly is not a redressed Rockfort Island (anyone?). Once the Prison opens up to some exterior locations, the quality in presentation jumps up higher as light shafts and dynamic looking fog set in that gives the environment itself some real character. It is beautiful, mysterious and has a few vistas to really breathe in and appreciate. The simulacrum of a sprawling Island is a gorgeous thing to behold, even if the grass tends to wave a little preternatural.\n\nThe story moves at a rather steady pace based on higher difficulties although I wished your antagonists would have done the same as many of those enemies you will fight appear to be stuck in a strange time warp and while running look like they are doing their best impressions to avoid conflict altogether. They are slow, cumbersome and awkward yet they can leap through the air with all the grace and agility of a cat. Very peculiar.\n\nYou can switch between partner characters to solve puzzles and each come loaded with their own inventory and play style, complete with a basic crafting system that allows the player to juryrig their own survival tools out of certain objects found throughout the world, such as molotovs, explosive bombs or herb combinations, with it only being the first episode, this may grow over time as I also found gunpowder, hinting at a more robust crafting system to come as the episodes are released. Claire will use sheer firepower and brute force to smash through resistance you find along the way whilst Moira opts to wield only a flashlight and crowbar which comes with its own game mechanics, she can blind enemies with her flashlight and follow up with a devestating strike from her crowbar, guns are out for her by pacifists choice, but give her an item she can do blunt force trauma with; wind her up and watch her go (makes sense right?). The controls are really what you would expect, they are digital, best with controller and appropriately tanky, but you wont find yourself hard up for maneuvering and traversing the environment nor is there any grievances with aiming. For the most part though this all feels believeably justified with each characters background story and offers a unique and indepth combat system which offers itself well to cooperative play which brings me to our highlight.\n\nMULTIPLAYER:\nThis is probably going to be the clincher for many of those looking to buy this game on the PC as Co-op is UTTERLY abscent, assumed dead. Now, reports were initially that multiplayer will have an eventual release after all the episodes for Raid Mode, at least online it will (or as supposedly promised, now who really knows or can trust?) but PC gamers have been completely lied to and decieved when Capcom initially stated that Revelations 2 would come packaged with a cooperative campaign, which not even twenty-four hours after release did they turn around and say that they have stripped this feature out to "ensure a stable user experience across a variety of different PC settings and devices." This is totally unfounded and COMPLETELY unnacceptable. Outright lying to consumers is bad business practice by anybodies standards and shame on us for being so privvy to their obvious and blatent disregard for our respect. Aside from the fact that we can choose to knock down our graphics on lower end machines if we were to have trouble, but the console ports offer the very same with further reports coming through about it being a far less stable product than even our own!\n\nVery soon it is going to take more than a solid dose of herbs to bring Resident Evil back from the dead because its veins are beginning to flow with far too much 'poison' and we know who is ultimately responsible.\n\nSCORE:\n[35/100]","February 26, 2015","false","121.8"," 56 of 98 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","56","98","6","0"

With each main-numbered entry since namely Resident Evil 4, the numbered RE's seem to have evolved into a more linear, direct, action-esque game with less emphasis on the old-school survival horror elements. RE: Revelations was created to bring back the more old-school style of survival horror and Revelations 2 continues this, while still evolving quite a bit. This time around, with Revelations 2, this series returns actually in an episodic format.\n\nIn Resident Evil: Revelations 2 - Episode 1: The Penal Colony, Claire Redfield returns with Moira Burton (Barry's daughter) by her side, as they go to a party that gets crashed and then wake up in a Penal Colony. They are trying to escape the Colony that is infected and infested with monsters. Barry Burton with a little girl by the name of Natalia go out towards this Penal Colony to find Barry's daughter (Moira). Claire + Moira have their own episode together here, while so does Barry + Natalia. In each episode, you control one character & the AI controls the other. You can give the AI orders; pass items b/t characters; and each switch b/t characters when necessary.\n\nEach character has their own abilities, weapons, and skills - so you will need to switch b/t characters to solve puzzles, do certain things, and even access certain areas. For example, Claire is more of the gun-toting character, while Moira has more of a focus on melee combat + can user her flashlight to stun enemies & find hidden objects in the game-world. Barry is the leader of his duo and is his episode's gun-toting character; meanwhile Natalia often throws bricks, can point out enemies and things close or distances away, fit in small areas others can't reach b/c she's a small child. Also, for how well you play and what you find in the game-world, you can upgrade your equipment at in-game work-benches & after an episode you can even upgrade the skills for your characters.\n\nRevelations 2's combat feels way less tank-like than what Revelations 1 had going on. Combat mechanics here feel a bit closer to what has been going on with the series since Resident Evil 4 and beyond. Having this advancement in combat is great here, since the game still knows to make sure it keeps the old survival-horror elements to keep long-time fans of the series happy. In spirit to what Revelations 1 was doing, Revelations 2 in this episode doesn't ditch the survival-horror elements of the older games. You still very likely can run out of ammo, need to conserve ammo, rely sometimes on melee combat, combine object, solve puzzles, traverse some not-so-linear areas & whatnot.\n\nPerformance in this game has been on my rig (i7 950; 16 GB DDR3 RAM; 4 GB VRAM GeForce GTX 960; Windows 7 64-bit) pretty good. With everything maxed-out in-game at 1080p & even with cranking my Nvidia Panel up to its Maximum, the game and its environments look certainly better than what Revelations 1 had going on. With more interesting & detailed character models, textures, and in-game environments than often Revelations 1 had going on, RE:R2 Episode 1 already feels like an improvement over the previous game in that regard. Most of the time, the game was running at 60 FPS (Frames Per Second) with in-game VSync On & the in-game 60 FPS cap turned on.\n\nThough, there were a few times when it performance would take some hits. Namely, this happened during area transitions & loads of an area; and just even at a few points while in-game it would take some nasty framerate hits (and cut the game right into half at around 30 frames for a few moments) - and then bounce right back to 60 frames in a matter of moments. This is a very minor issue, as this didn't happen too often and seemed to happen at times when nothing was really happening on-screen anyways.\n\nBy relying on the evolution of RE's main-game's combat improvements here & by combining that with making sure horror-survival elements (often found in older titles like earlier Resident Evil games + SIlent Hill series), this here is nothing but a formula that looks to be written for nothing but success. RE: Revelations 2 - Episode 1: The Penal Colony succeeds, delivering a fantastic opening episode to start the Season here for Revelations 2 (which should take around 2-4 hours for most to finish). Also, by offering-up a nice plot-twist ending at Episode 1's completion & the game offering up an excellent preview of things to come in the next episode, I'll certainly be looking forward Episode 2...and likely the entire Season, given how great Episode 1 turned-out.","October 20, 2015","true","4.3"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","28","46","3","1"

It's little bit of those things. Basically it's a story driven game focused on single player, similar to Resident Evil: Revelations, though this time around you're on an island instead of a ship.\n\nIt's episodic rather than full day one release (at least if you bought it at launch, you was only able to play one episode, and wait week between the next episodes). I found that frustrating, because I like to play games in couple days, and not sit idle for month to actually be done with it. But that aside, if you get it now, when everything is released it's all good right, well not really. Game still suffer from bad optimization, no multiplayer Raid co-op, even though Capcom confirmed they screwed up with store page information and misled a lot of people.\n\nGameplay wise game is similar to it's predecessor, yet lacks same kind of polish. You go through fenced levels, complete puzzles by finding right set of levers and doors, pick up ammo, weapons, upgrade parts on the way, visit occasional bench for modification, basically same. Yet this time around, you have ability to switch between characters, as you tend to run in constant duo team. Need to open specific door? = switch to other character; need to find hidden loot? = switch to character with flashlight (their new finding secret loot mechanic), etc. We all know that Revelations was kind of intended to be the single player series, "in between" main Resident Evil games, but this clearly looks like a co-op feature, yet is only available for local split screen co-op, go figure, why even bother adding that complication. Could have spent all that time on optimization.\n\nEnemies are somewhat smart, they will dodge if you aim at them, usually charge you, some stay at range and lob nasty stuff your way, others are invisible or have special weakspots you have to destroy to kill them, etc.\n\nGame environments look boring, with plenty of horrible texture work and effects yet with increased system requirements for no reason. Character models look mediocre, with good textures yet ugly face features on female part, especially on Claire, Gina (I don't know how hard it is to hire some competent 3D modeler to make decent face).\n\nStory wise it's weaker than 1st game, by A LOT. Character interactions feel emotionless most of the time, there are crazy cut-scenes once in a while that show full potential of how game should have looked, because they are clearly made using same engine, yet looks nothing like real game. Story was not interesting for me at all, when I saw main villain I was like: Are they serious, how lazy was that? They couldn't find any other suitable character? Next time they will just add cousins that suffer from "World Dominance Syndrome", seriously. The most I enjoyed out of the whole story, were part you play as Moira and Grandpa as the bonus episode. That's how enjoyable story was for me, basically that episode is more like a extended Raid mission, rather than story.\n\nThus we get to the best part of the game, the mode where you kill infected, get medals, unlock new weapons, level up, get new skills, play with different characters on different levels - aka RAID. That is the most fun I got out of this mess, I know that at least 50% of the campaign used similar level assets from 1st game, and Raid mode had A LOT of levels from previous Resident Evil titles, but it's fine. Gina was by far the most fun character to play as, mostly because of her looks (at least from behind, face was fugly as hell though). Compared to Raid mode in 1st game, this was well made, with better difficulty choices. Not much in terms of costumes, nothing for Gina just your default secretary outfit, but who cares.\n\nANYWAYS, this has been mostly "how I feel about the game", so it's my opinion, I'll stick to mine, you stick to yours, think of it what you may. Maybe some of the info will provide an insight. Verdict is simple, if you're true Resident Evil fan, you don't need reviews, you already bought the game, if you're skeptical, get 1st episode, see how it goes, how it runs on your PC, if you like, get next, etc. Good luck.","March 18, 2015","true","30.0"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

Well buckle up, because it just gets faster from here.\n\nThe graphics are excellent. Not too overly-emphasized, not poor quality, a nice balance that reassures you it looks good, but looking good isn't all there is to it.\n\nThe gameplay is solid. Building off the REV approach, they've tweaked and revised it here and there, and adapted it to include a switching character approach reminiscent of RE Zero...but FAR less tedious. The point of using both characters is logical and well implemented; it makes sense. A lot of people still won't like it on principle alone, but it's one of the better approaches to the idea I've seen.\n\nThe atmosphere is great. This first chapter is giving me an enourmous Code Veronica vibe, and that's a good thing. From what I've seen, from here it takes leads from RE2/3 and RE1 itself in the proceeding chapters.\n\nIs it perfect? Hell no. I'm not blind to the odd framerate drops, or the fact that the camera input needs work, but I'm also willing to give the benefit of the doubt that they will be patched.\n\nAll I see is people complaining about a lack of online co-op and raid mode not working properly. If what you care about in a RESIDENT EVIL game is its multiplayer credentials, you are literally part of the reason the franchise is so deeply troubled today.\n\nResident Evil is about the cheesy horror story, but well done atmosphere. It's about cliche American horror movie style protagonist rattling off sardonic commentary and one-liners while facing down enemies that border on being unfair.\n\nRevelations 2 is exactly what it should be. A great, flawed, survival horror game that's shamelessly referrential of itself and the horror classics, that divides everyone who plays it.\n\nI'm not going to tell you to buy it. Make up your own mind. But don't be swayed by people who are downvoting and ragging on the game for its MULTIPLAYER shortcomings. Read carefully. You'll see very few people with a negative opinion of the game are actually talking about THE GAME itself; the story, the gameplay, the atmosphere. Just endlessly parroting the same three criticisms of a framerate bug, questionable camera control, and multiplayer shortcomings.\n\nThey're completely missing the point.\n\n\nEDIT (27/02)\n\nI'm not a blind fan-boy. Point of fact, while I loved the original Revelations, I despised RE5 and 6, and I didn't particularly like RE4 either. Moreover, I have nothing BUT criticism for Capcom over their handling of the Megaman franchise, or what's left of it at this point, or how dispecably they've acted regarding the Lost Planet franchise.\n\nI suppose I should not be surprised that such accusations are the default fallback relied on to content my standpoint, but you're entirely missing the point. The store page for REV2 is proliferated with people complaining about this multiplayer issue. As hard as I'm sure it is for you to understand, not everyone will seek to buy REV2 for multiplayer. Being a RESIDENT EVIL and all. And for those people, there are very few reviews of the actual GAME ITSELF, as opposed to endless commentary on the multiplayer issues.\n\nThe very reason I won't bother to contend this misconception that the multiplayer is the subject of false advertising is that it's futile. You bought a game that was perfectly well known to only have cooperative play in RAID MODE, expecting the co-op to then exist in campaign mode. No such claim was ever made. The store page for REV2 from my end of the world (Australia) never implied the campaign would have co-op, nor did I expect it to, because the original REV didn't either.\n\nAs for the multiplayer in RAID mode not working yet? I can only surmise you don't fully understand the complications of developing a game, particularly one designed for episodic content delivery. The multiplayer component of the game was most likely not finished in time for the Episode 1 release date, forcing them to leave it out at the last moment. Yes, it's disappointing. But it's not the end of the world, and it's not necessarily the great and terrible rip-off conspiracy many people are making it out to be.\n\nI do not support game developers ripping off their customers. I also don't support jumping to consclusions and speaking ♥♥♥♥ without proper understanding.","February 25, 2015","true","28.2"," 107 of 195 people (55%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","55","107","195","12","14"

Optimization has definately improved from launch, this can be seen especially in two raid mode levels stage 3-3 (and 5-2 to a lesser extent) was basically unplayable with massive frame rate drops and now runs smoothly. (yes even after they screwed it up and fixed it again, sniper scoping still seems to be unattended to.)\n\n2. The game feels just like resident evil 4 which some people will complain about and some will absolutely love, this one is up to personal preference.\n\n3. Offline co-op is fully instated into the game for story, however two controllers are needed for this, online co-op is instated for raid mode only, capcom has said time and time again that there will not be any online co-op for the campaign, which is sad considering my next point.\n\n4. The one and only major flaw with the campaign that I experienced is that the AI is abhorrently stupidly inept that they have trouble climing stairs, FREAKING STAIRS, to mention nothing of ladders, if you're being claire the AI will stare at you looking dumbfounded as they are repeatedly attacked by whatever is next to them, at least they have regenerating health, that's the only thing that makes them even partially tolerable since they can tank hits and be a nice little target while you pick off the enemy, simply make sure that if you need to switch to moira or natalia that barry/claire are in a completely safe area where they have no chance of being attacked, and forget about taking the AI gun usage skill as its just laughable.\n\n5. The game difficulty is actually very per player basis, if you want a full survival horror game where ammo is extremely limited go for survival mode right off the bat, if you simply want the story but also want survival for the reward, go for casual or normal and gather weapons and ammo to carry over into survival, which I think is pretty nice although a full inventory reset function might be nice for some people to simply have the option.\n\n6. Some say the story is cliche, lackluster, bad, etc. some say it's interesting, again this is personal preferance, although as a heads up there are two endings, (extremely minor spoiler) at the end of claire's episode 3 bossfight there's a small button mashing moment, however if you don't mash the button you can instead switch character to moira and then go, this moment decides the ending of the game (extremely minor spoiler over).\n\n7. Qtes are thankfully mostly gone, there is of course the one here and there when an enemy grabs you and when there's a melee prompt, but you won't have cutscenes full of them like RE6, in fact aside from the one aforementioned (in the spoiler above) moment there aren't any qtes at all.\n\nthat's about all I have to say, overall I like the game.

Set after Revelations 1 and before RE6 (but not really connected to either story), Claire Redfield has been abducted along with Barry Burton's daughter Moira, and Barry is trying to rescue them with the help of a mysterious young girl called Natalia.\n\nEach of the four episodes has a Claire/Moira chapter followed by a Barry/Natalia chapter, and the player can switch control between the characters at will. Claire and Barry are the primary characters for combat against the undead. Moira and Natalia both have a melee weapon, but neither can use guns. They can find hidden items (mostly ammo and gems) that Claire/Barry can't see, and Natalia can "sense" the presence of monsters, which is useful to check ahead for danger. There's also one particular enemy that requires the use of this ability in a very interesting way (I won't spoil the surprise).\n\nCombat is mostly the slower pace associated with traditional survival horror, where you fight small groups of strong enemies and have limited ammo. There are a few action focused set pieces, where you'll get locked in a room with lots of monsters, especially with Claire. Barry has some areas where the layout allows him to sneak up behind enemies and perform instant kill stealth takedowns. The guns are the usual handgun, magnum, shotgun, smg, rifle, and you can also craft a few different types of throwables such as molotovs and smoke bombs.\n\nThe downside of having two characters working together is that it negates the impact of horror. Being alone is always scarier. But on the other hand, some of my favourite parts of this game were sections that required the use of both characters to solve puzzles. And the dialogue between the characters helped to keep the story moving. The story is pretty good and voice acting is superb.\n\nAfter each chapter there's a basic upgrade system, where you can exchange points earned from your performance (quicker completion time, fewer deaths and better accuracy equals more points) and finding gems for stronger passive skills (more weapon damage, herbs heal more, etc).\n\nIt took me 13 hours to finish the main story plus two "bonus episodes". Graphics are an upgrade from Revelations 1 (probably that game's weakest point) and I had no problems with framerate, bugs or crashes. Controls are mostly rebindable and work well with mouse and keyboard, however it wouldn't detect my mouse thumb buttons which forced me to find unusual keys for some commands.\n\nRevelations 2 is a must play for any fan of Resident Evil, and even if you're not a fan, its a really good game that's worth checking out.","April 19, 2015","true","24.8"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Baraho/recommended/287290/","Baraho","Baraho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Baraho/","132 products in account","I will withhold final judgment until I have played all episodes.\n\nA preliminary review based on current observations from Episodes 1 and 2 can be found below.\n\nThe good:\n\n(+) Perhaps this game's most innovative aspect is revisitation. You fight your way with Clair and Moira through one place, and then Barry and Natalia show up in the same place later. Whichever way you affect the environment with the first duo, the second will be there to witness it (or fight it). It makes you plan ahead and think twice as hard for both pairs of characters.\n\n(+) Many of its qualities so far, from the almost intentionally so-bad-it's-good dialogue and golden continuity nods, to the airtight resource management and neatly hidden objects, feel like a true service to the fans of survival horror genre, and classical RE games specifically.\n\n(+) It combines those properties with smooth character animations, mildly challenging gameplay, and the first Revelations' simple yet satisfying customization system. The more valuable a weapon part is, the harder it's gonna be to obtain.\n\nEdit: I take that "mildly" back. Enemies in Episode 2 are far more challenging.\n\n(+) The new talent tree they've added lends you specific secondary abilities that you can do without if you so please, but they can certainly help a lot, especially ones that have to do with healing or dealing damage. It's more of a flavor addition than a mandatory component.\n\n(+) Raid mode, like "Mercenaries" mode in other REs, adds to the very much needed replay value that a lot of other games today seem to neglect. Raid mode has strong RPG elements, like leveling up, which grants access to skills, equipping a set of passive skills and weapons, and a plethora of different activities to play.\n\nThe bad:\n\n(-) A few enemy animations are unpleasant to look at and seem almost amateurishly done, especially the faster ones.\n\n(-) I would normally forgive bad dialogue from Capcom games in general, but no one says "what in a moist barrel of ♥♥♥♥s" or "mother of balls" in a life-threatening situation. Not that I object to profanity, in fact I relish in it, but some of the curse words they've used seem so artificial and unspontaneous.\n\n(-) Having to unlock a certain ability using BP (Battle Points) before you could have your armed partner assist you in combat is not a good idea, though the fact that he/she won't spend any ammo by doing so kind of balances it out.\n\nEdit: Even with the partner assist skill unlocked, it seems your armed partner will shoot so scarcely and so infrequently that you're better off assuming direct control of them and doing the shooting yourself.\n\n(-) There are two different "pick-up" buttons, one for files and one for equipment, which I find entirely unnecessary and confusing.\n\n(-) Seeing my mouse cursor during cutscenes is a big no-no.\n\n(-) The whole thing in general, to me, feels low budget. It could be argued that this is because of the aforementioned few bad enemy animations, but I personally can't put my finger on why it feels so.\n\nNow what?\n\n(%) As of Episode 2, things are certainly looking up. The second episode is a massive improvement; the plot is taking turn for the better, enemies are getting much more challenging, and plenty more secret areas to explore.\n\n(%) Even with the game's flaws, it is certainly unfair to brush it off as bad. The two episodes we have right now consistently prove that this game has a lot to offer.\n\n(%) If you enjoy third person shooters, have enjoyed some of the older RE games, or are generally a fan of the survival horror genre, I can confidently say this game will appeal to you.","February 26, 2015","true","83.0"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

It does feel like a RE game (even though I prefer the old school RE1, RE2, RE3 gameplay), it's nice to see and play as Barry & Claire and there are some good classic styled puzzles. Plus raid-mode is an addictive and challenging bonus.\n\nHowever the visuals (other than the playable character models) are low quality, the environments are quite frankly boring with too many long corridors and empty uninspired areas. The enemies are mostly a little dull and not very scary. There is also some poorly designed areas of gameplay that just become frustrating. Lastly, if you play solo you miss out on probably the most enjoyable aspect of the game.\n\nHaving said all that, it's not a bad game and for a fan there's a lot of fun to be had.

However I do own it on the PS4 so my play review/experience will be on that version until my main PC arrives.\n\nGraphics - look nice enough. Good lighting effects, shadows.\nSound - Guns sound good! very impressed with the gun fire sounds.  Monsters groaning can be annoying after awhile.  In raid mode there is a constant hissing sound as monsters spawn in ... I thought it was part of the music but after i turned off the music it persisted ... It is very annoying as it causes me to constantly turn to see if a monster spawned behind me.\nControls - They aren't bad... only complaint is the game pad dodge key is not in a easy to reach place.  On laptop i can easily tap the space with my thumb but on a game pad I am usually attacking the the knife and yeah ....\n\nCO-OP - doesn't exist at this moment. I don't know why they didn't launch with online co-op because solo raid mode is boring as hell.\n\nStory - It is alright, it seems to be building onto something.\n\nAI - It pisses me off .... your partner sometimes helps you out .. and with the gameplay mechanics the way they are you have to play as Moira or Natalia constantly as way to save ammo, and find hidden crap, stun enemies .. as the AI won't do any of that for you.  Barry and Rebecca sometimes attack ... Barry is the worst offender .. he dosn't attack unless Nat tosses a brick or swings the brick and then it's only once.\n\nRaid mode - There are a ton of stages but it gets old without online co-op. A few levels weren't very well designed and if you don't have a ton of ammo on you from the start ... they are near impossible to complete.  A bunch of the stages are recycled re6 stages and to date the only unlockables I have found are just completing enough missions to unlock characters.  I have not seen anything (yet) to indicate additional outfits (outside of the DLC ones).  The mode is simple enough with objectives and weapon upgrades and parts drop often enough to keep you in the fight. I honestly liked RE: RE1's raid interface because it was simple and straight forward.... now I have to waste time running around a room clicking on different things that used to be done in a menu. The worst offense that raid mode does is enemy spawning (they can spawn behind you and even under you) but other than that and lack of co-op raid mode is pretty solid. Additionally, each character has their own level unlike RE: RE1 where only the player levels. All weapons scale to players so if you have a level 10 gun it will go on your level 1 char with reduced stats so you do not have to juggle gear. As it stands I haven't seen any need at this point to buy any DLC storage space expansions.\n\nI just tried and failed time attack mode ... I lost due to characters standing around in forced dialogue as the clock ran out.... so not thrilled about that.\n\nInvis mode - no desire to play it.\n\nBiggest DLC complaint so far:\n\nMoira has a Katana and she doesn't use it >.>\n\nThis is a fun game ... I just wish they didn't force you to use the weaker partner constantly to find the invisible objects... I want to rock the house as Barry ... not run around pointing at things and worthlessly throwing bricks.\n\nRight now my I-7 2.2Ghz 16GB GeForce 560M laptop struggles with the game with completly random framerate stuttering making it too hard to play so I have to await my main PC for a updated Graphic review... But if they do not sort out this coop soon my favorability of this game will drop harder than the framerates on my laptop.","March 6, 2015","true","48.5"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

I first played RE Revelations on my 3DS and I had expected a lot from it given the whole point behind it was what this game had finally done. I wouldn't say it exactly put you into the series' roots but it has some of the older ones feel (RE4/RE5). Everything here is considered an improvement including the story. I was satisfied by this game and I easily would support the developers doing more of this gameplay style. However, not every game is without its drawbacks. There are 2 characters in each campaign and I suppose I was bothered by the fact that there is one character in both Claire and Barry's campaign that is able to find hidden items across the map. Of course, the player would not ignore to look for these items and the AI doesn't help you finding these items if you are playing single player. So, this resulted in me sticking with playing as Moira/Natalia throughout the whole campaign which really annoyed me since I wanted to have my leisure time to switch between characters. Nevertheless, it was an entertaining game and I would forget about the blunder the developers made in RE revelations 1 now that this game has at least some redeeming qualities. The extra episodes weren't worth it, they didn't reveal anything about the story so I would only recommend the main campaign. Raid mode was alright to wait between episodes but it didn't exactly draw me for more than a few hours. Good game. I'd also recommend getting it on a sale, it isn't exactly all the rage to buy on full price.","March 21, 2015","true","46.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

I asked him.\n"Why must I not?" He replied.\n\nHe said his name was Phil and he was done with the zed life.\nGuts didn't taste the same way they used to.\nHe said he came to this facility to start anew and wanted to make a name for himself.\nI wanted to help out so I threw a decoy bottle at his feet.\nAll of his bros turned to watch him explode in glory.\n\n10/10\n\nWould make new friends again.\n__________\n\nIn truth, this is a very comfortable and welcoming addition to the RE franchise.\nWhile embracing it's survival horror roots it brings fresh mechanics to the table as well.\n\nDo you hate co-op in survival horror games? I personally do.\nThis game not only competently and seamlessely let's you switch between two characters at any time mid-play - it deeply encourages it. I too recommend this style of play as you get more out of the game. Each character comes with their own strengths and weaknesses. In example, Claire can carry firearms where as Moira can only wield a flashlight to blind enemies, a crowbar to use with powerful finishing blows and sub-weapons. This breathes fresh air in how to approach each fight. New to the franchise is also the ability to stealth kill with your knife. This gives a type of satisfaction you never thought possible. Online co-op is also available.\n\nOnline co-op is also available for Raid Mode, which made it's debut in Revelations. This, whether you want to acknowledge it or not, is the other 50% of content this game has in store. With a vast variety of levels, weapons, mods and a high lvl cap, this mode will have you plugging hours upon hours into it.\n\nWhile crafting in RE is nothing new, REV2 does a good job at bringing new items to the table. Not only do you need to worry about your health depleting, you'll need to worry about losing blood and becoming blinded. You can now gather the supplies to craft Tourniquets to stop your character from bleeding out when they get those deep wounds as well as the supplies to craft Disinfectant when you get blinded by the enemy's fluid discharges. New sub-weapons such as Fire Bombs, Decoy Bottles, Exploding Bottles and Smokescreen Bottles  are craftable and come in handy against the new threats. Be careful though, because your item menu is in real-time.\n\nAlot of new infected make their appearances in this game and I was very impressed with the direction they decided to take it. Finally embracing it's influences shamelessly you will definitely get a slight feeling that the characters might have just escaped from Silent Hill. I personally had a few flashbacks of playing The Suffering back in the day while encountering a few enemies. Don't let this shoo you off, for the influence is lovingly presented with RE's signature style. They all feel very comfortable and are solid entries within the family of infected. I will not list the new enemy types because experiencing them is half the excitement.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this title to RE fans and survival horror fans everywhere.","April 3, 2015","true","42.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","8","10","6","0"

Due to that episodes/chapters are extremelly uneven - some are great, offer a lot of various content, some are just walking doing nothing or solving 1 puzzle and you're done. Some chapters take 1-1.5h to finish, some take 15 minutes. Pacing for this game is all over the place.\n\nBut besides these things - it was nice side-story set in RE Universe. And it has coop done right this time - characters have different abilities and all are useful.\n\nOh and DLC content is worthless - both playable content DLCs are just reused maps from the main game used for stupid and uninspired boring gamemodes. TheStruggle is just set of horde modes (defeat all enemies coming in waves, 25 enemies remaining) on maps we already visited with some excuse of a story that you can explain in 3 lines of text.

Sadly it relys on jumpscares most of the game and I'm fine with that because it actually works but I wish it was more than just jump scares. The gameplay is very fun, you have to handle each character differently because they all do different things and have different uses, for example Moria has a flashlight and a crowbar while Claire uses guns so you'll have to use each character the way there meant to. The story is good, but I wish it was a more intense story I just expected so much more in the story and sadly it just wasn't "all that". But it does have its moments and isn't predictable.

Second, the atmoshere in the RER2 really expresses the meaning of the name"Resident Evil", I don't think the RE series doesn't need to change to keep pace with the development of the society, but change doesn't mean you need to abandon all the thing you've already got. RE6 abandoned the nature that makes the RE a real RE, so, as far as i'm concerned, RE6 is the worst episode of the RE series and I really hope the Capcom will give the task of RE7 to the producer who was in charge of the production of the RER2.\n\nAlthough I recomment this game, frankly it has a problem that makes you unable to enjoy the game completely. I don't know why, but the framerate issue became severe after the game was updated on Feb.27. Before that, everything was just fine. Those who are still watching better just wait until the patch that deals with this problem is issued. Hope the patch can come out on the day episode 2 is released.","March 2, 2015","true","116.6"," 32 of 56 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","32","56","0","0"

While lots of people say that Resident Evil went down hill once 4 came out, I am one of the few old school Resident Evil players to actually have enjoyed all major Resident Evil releases, including 4 and up. Resident Evil Revelations 2 in my opinion is a decent mix of scary moments, with tense action horror. The co-op is extremely fun, and perhaps the most interesting in the series thus far. If you have someone willing to play a side character who doesn't get as many fun toys, but does get some interesting perks, then you or your partner should enjoy it.\n\nOne of the other positives to this game, at least on release, was it's cheap price. The game launched at 24.99, and for that price it's a great bang for your buck. The episodes are not extremely long, but they feel just right, and by the end of the game you will most likely feel like you got more than what you paid out of this game.\n\nI do have some major gripes however. This game launched with no campaign co-op support on PC, and while they did fix that, there is still NO ONLINE campaign co-op. I pre-ordered this game assuming this would have been standard, as it was with all previous co-op RE titles, but sadly this game was not. I ended up having to split my 27" monitor screen with my best friend, and split screen in this day and age should be completely optional. LAN mode, or even online campagin should have been a no brainer, quite frankly it's pathetic it wasn't included. Yes I'm happy I get split screen, but still the developers should have done better.\n\nAlso a nitpick, as I mentioned above the side characters do not fire weapons, and have unique abilities. While this was interesting, and at times pretty damn fun, it would have been nice for them to have felt a little more useful, purley for higher fun factor for your co-op friends.\n\nAll in all, it was another fun Resident Evil game, if you don't mind the direction the series has moved in. Great value, just be sure to have a big screen for co-op play.","May 9, 2015","true","22.5"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","16","26","0","2"

Revelations 2 takes place between RE5 and 6 and ties in strongly to the main story arche of the series. Without any spoiler I will say the events will effect future titles. It was done very well and ties up a few loose ends.\n\nRevelations 2 puts the player in the shoes of two fan favorite characters, Claire Redfield and Barry Burton (star characters from the first two games) who each has their respective partner. Claire has Barry's daughter Moira Burton as her partner and Barry has the mysterious new charater Natalia to accompany him. Claire and Barry will handle the majority of the action while Moira and Natalia will provide much needed support. You can swap between both the main and support character at anytime during the game while the AI will control the other character (think RE0 if you have played that before). The combat is extremely fluid and very addicting once you get the hang of character swapping.\n\nSpeaking of combat, this is not RE6. The ammo in this game is far more scarce and you must stun an enemy before you can melee (much like re4 and 5). You will want to use your ammo wisely to make sure you do not run out, which will happen if you go in blazing. A new feature in this game is an MMO style skill system that you can level up with Battle Points you earn for completing chapters. This allows you to specialize your character in certain areas to make them more effecient to your playstyle. If you are a fan of this costumization system you can look forward to spending many hours in Raid mode after completing the main story. In this mode you can choose between many different characters and level them up in a dungeon style setting while acquiring new weapons and skills along the way.\n\nA few of the settings in the game are unsettling, especially the prison where the game begins. However several of the areas can become bland fast and this is one of the games true weak spots. There are some very unique enemies, however there is not a large variety. The Revenants will surely creep you out when you first meet them.\n\n~To sum up; If you are a fan of Resident Evil you should buy this game. It has a very relevant story and some long missed characters. It has a much stronger focus on the survival aspect than more recent titles in the series. The lack of enemy variety and the bland scenery are the most obvious downsides. You do get a lot of content for the price of the game, especially if you plan on sinking time into the bonus modes.~","April 7, 2015","true","65.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/287290/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","Resident Evil Revelations 2 was a wonderful surprise to me. I mean I expected it to be good since I liked Revelations 1. But this was still better than I dared hope. This was apparently a lower budget game, as it isn’t sold at full price. But there isn’t much evidence of cheapness in the final product.\n\nCompared to the main Resident Evil games, Revelations 2 feels a bit crude and rough around the edges. The quality of the visuals is somewhere between Resident Evil 4 and 5, achieving a style that feels oldschool, but also ageless. It gets the basics right of how you’re supposed to stage and light a scene for the intended effect, with the least amount of technical brute force. There are a ton of locations, and loads of different enemies. It doesn’t feel compromised.\n\nThe game feels like a greatest hits of features from Resident Evil 4, 5 and 6. Movement feels similar to those games, but now with the addition of being able to dodge in any direction. All the enemies are designed with this in mind, as even the most basic enemies can run and jump at you. The system felt great when I started to get into the habit of spamming the dodge button as soon as I saw enemies winding up their attack animations.\n\nThe whole game is designed around co-op, but I played it in singleplayer, and that works just fine. Switching characters is done with a quick and satisfying zooming animation, and the game seems to give your AI partner more health when you’re not controlling them. They were never a nuisance, and I felt like I could just relax and let them do whatever they wanted while I fought off attackers myself.\n\nEnemy design is superb, working both as a greatest hits of the series, but also bringing many inventive new creatures to the table. Most importantly, the difficulty balance feels just as good as it was in Resident Evil 4 and 5. You often get out of big battles with only a single bullet left in your inventory. This is done intentionally, so you’re never screwed over by the game, as it knows to give you a break after giving you a hard time. It’s superbly paced, never doing too much of anything before changing things up, clearly having learned from the best of the series past. It shows restraint, not overdoing anything. For example, there’s maybe only two jump scares in the entire game, and loads and loads of sections where you expect jump scares, but nothing happens.\n\nThe most wonderful thing in Revelations 2 is the quality of the writing. It’s unapologetically Resident Evil. Head writer on this game was Dai Sato, who has one hell of a track record, having written some of the best episodes of shows like Space Dandy, Ergo Proxy, Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex and Eureka Seven. He was also head writer on Revelations 1, and it feels like him and the rest of the Revelations 1 & 2 development team work together beautifully. This isn’t some literary masterpiece, as it’s still just as hokey as you’d expect from a Resident Evil game. There’s hilariously evil villains conducting bio weapons research, murdering loads of people without conscience. So this isn’t trying to reinvent Resident Evil in any way, and isn’t going for a new audience or anything like that. This is still the same wonderful ridiculous Resident Evil, but written with something resembling a heart, with a love for what the series is.\n\nWhat makes this so good is how it treats all other Resident Evil games as canon, but with a level of self awareness that the series hasn’t had before. It embraces the camp, showing clear love for it, and still poking fun at it. For example Barry Burton is a playable character for the first time in the series. He famously had the greatest lines in history in the first game, about Jill being the master of unlocking, and the Jill sandwich line. In Revelations 2 he’s older, a father out to save his daughter who went missing on a mysterious island. Other characters talk behind his back about how he keeps going on about the glory days of when he and Jill went on adventures in the RE 1 mansion, and he keeps making the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokes just as he did in that game. And sure enough, when you play as him in Revelations 2, he drops several weapons grade puns. But there’s more to him than that, and it’s the same for all the main characters. At first when I saw that it was a co-op game I thought “eww, but I want to play alone!”. But thanks to the writing, I was happy to always have another character there, because the quality of the banter elevates the game.\n\nYou might want to sit down for this next bit: The characters have wants and needs outside of the events occurring in the game, and go through arcs where they learn and change as people by the end of the game. I know, that sounds like the bare minimum of what you’d expect in a story, and yet that is still quite remarkable to see in a game. It’s fairly easy to predict what’s going to happen next in the story as you’re playing. But the journey to get there was more exciting than I expected. Just as it sets out to actually fulfill the bare minimum of what a good story is like, it also executes it on the level of quality that you should expect, where character moments feel earned, and you actually empathize with them. This is again something that is depressingly rare, not just in games, but in your average action film as well. We should expect stories to at least be this good. But they aren’t, which made this stand out to me. They actually gave a ♥♥♥♥, and had people who know how to tell a story be allowed to put it into the game in a way where it works effectively. What a concept.\n\nThe game isn’t even close to perfect, as there are a couple areas that feel like filler, and on a couple occasions the story conveniently bails out of scenes prematurely just so they can extend the length of the game a bit. But even with all those flaws, I loved this game. For long stretches of the game I was smiling, and whenever the game tried to be tense and spooky, I was feeling tense and spooked! Everything about it from the title to the tone feels silly and stupid. But it’s the best kind of silly and stupid, done in a completely earnest way, by people who took the project seriously, and didn’t hold anything back because they looked down on the game, the series, or the audience. If you liked Resident Evil 1, 2, 3, Code Vernonica, 4, 5 or Revelations 1, you will most likely have a wonderful time here. It’s everything I like about Resident Evil, without the dreary and slightly desperate tone of Resident Evil 6. Just like Revelations 1, the first 30-60 minutes of the game aren’t the greatest. For a moment there I thought “oh no, have they made another bad RE game?” But then Barry Burton was introduced, and I started loving it.","February 25","true","12.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

They say even if its not true survival horror, it still goes into the right direction. I dont agree with that. Revelations had its moments, but everything in that game was let down by the fact that its a DS port and you felt it every second. So with Revelations 2 we get a proper Revelations game, developed for the main platforms.\nUnfortunately this is not an AAA game, Capcom will probably reserve that for Resident Evil 7. That means that the graphics, animations and sound effects are not great (about the same level as Resident Evil 5). The most dissapointing is the level design. Its not bad, but you can really feel the technical limitations. Actually there are some really cool levels in this game, but Im sure with proper technology they could make much bigger and more complex levels.\nThe combat is the same as always, but less clonky as in previous games. What I like the most is that they added the dodge move (was already in Rev1) which makes combat much more dynamic and makes you think about evading enemies and maybe trying to use the knife and conserve ammo. And you actually need to conserve ammo in this game unlike many other Resident Evil games (on Survival difficulty at least). I also like the "finishers" which returned from previous games, after you shoot an enemy on weak spots they get stunned and you can do a melee attack which makes them fall and take extra damage. This is another way to conserve ammo, but also puts you in risk because you have to get close to the enemies. This would be even better if the melee attacks werent so op. When you target one enemy with a melee attack you are invulnerable while you are attacking and every enemy close to the target will also fall down which makes these really powerful and there is really no reason not to use them (less decisions to make as the player, less depth).\nThere arent that many weapons in the game, you basicly get a weapon for every weapon type you can think of and thats it. In previous games you also got better weapons of the same type later in the game (this is also in Rev2, but only for 2 or 3 weapons). To compensate they have weapon customisation parts, upgrades which increase stats of the weapons. These are not a bad idea, and are also something to reward players for exploration, especially people who find secrets where they find very rare parts, but the upgrades are boring most of the time, because its just stuff like +5% dmg, +10% attack speed. There are some more fun stuff like a charge shot you can get, but those make the game a little arcady for my taste but hey its better than nothing. Thinking about which weapon to use in combat and changing mid-fight depending on the situation is really fun and you do not simply change to shotgun when close ranged and to pistol when mid ranged, it also depends on the enemies. Some are fast, some slow but tanky, some fly, some have weak spots and stuff like that. However every enemy in this game will be familiar to you from previous games, but unlike previous games, even Revelations 1 which was a DS game, the enemies in Revelations 2 are designed really boring visually. They look like the enemies from The Evil Within, and those also looked boring. Not only that, but they also have really bad sound design, not that Resident Evil enemies had that memorable sound effects, but in previous games you still could identify every enemy by sound, in Revelations 2 however enemies rarely even make a sound. There are like 1 or 2 good enemies, but thats about it. Especially for Episode 3 or at least Episode 4 I expected that they introduce another enemy type, but no. This made Episode 4 a little bit boring, because there was nothing new, they even reused 1 boss like 3 times. Whats weird about this is how much content there is actually in this game. You have the main campaign, which consists of 4 episodes which take about 2-3 hours = 10 hours total, and on top of that you have 2 extra episodes (which I didnt played yet), and on top of that you have Raid mode.\nIn my opinion they shouldnt make a Raid mode or extra episodes, but instead spent that time on making the main campaign better, more enemies, more weapons, better level design. I know there are people who like Raid mode, but in my opinion its a complete waste of time. Its nothing else than a grindfest, enemies dont even attack you like in the campaign, its extremely easy, arcady, and you can see that this is a game from japan because Raid mode is in the game. The only reason people are interested in it (imho) is because they can get a little more playtime out of their game, at least you can upgrade your character and level up. The thing is the skills you unlock are totally useless and extremely boring. Also the weapons you unlock are useless, cause later you only need 1 weapon (if you upgrade the weapon type you get tons of ammo for it).\nWhat I was surprised by the most is the story of this game. It has the usual cheesy writing of RE games and over top plot, but it also had some interesting characters and was fun to listen to. I mean the characters are still cliche (Moira), but they were good enough. There were some twists and turns and some of them actually surprising, but most of them I was expecting miles ahead. But again, the story was solid, it was fun.\n\nTo conclude I only want to say that I believe that this game would be a MUCH MUCH better game if they had done the following things:\n1. only 1 playable character, no coop, no parallel storylines\n2. take out Raid mode, use the time spent on that on the main campaign\n3. no episodes\n4. obviously more budget is better, but I guess its fine cause this costs only 25€\n\nAnd because this game only costs 25€ I can easily recommend it to any Resident Evil fan, but for everyone else there are enough alternatives. If you really find this game interesting for some reason then you wont regret the purchase either.","March 27, 2015","true","16.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The Resident Evil series has been wildly skewed since its humble, campy beginnings but it built a lucrative franchise for CAPCOM so it's not surprising that they've been milking this particular cash cow for close to two decades. Unfortunately, their last few additions to the RE series have been ludicrous rather than lucrative, some so terrible that they've become the insult to the injury that the movie adaptations scored in the franchise.\n\nRER2 EP 1 plays absolutely horrendously. The frequent frame rate drops, terrible mouse and keyboard controls, the frankly dated environment graphics, the terrible integration of standing graphics verses interactive graphics, the too short episode (which played like a prolog to the episode rather than an episode), and the blatant lies and hamfisted attempts to cover up those lies about features that were advertised since day 1 of the preorder cycle lead me to conclude that this game was never intended for a PC audience. CAPCOM yet again just wanted to cash in on the PC market money without actually committing effort to adapt to the needs and requirements of the market. It's clear that there was little to no testing for this badly ported title and in how quickly the company was to blame the consumers as well as some unknown copy-editor or intern for the misrepresentation of their product which didn't seem to bother them until the consumers started to complain about missing and/or misrepresented features promised to them.\n\nThe cons outweigh the pros thus far in this disastrous addition to the RE series and not even the absolute nostalgic novelty of playing Barry Burton can or ever could take the sting of betrayal, shady business practices, and simply bad ports that CAPCOM continues to employ when it comes to their offerings to the PC market.\n\nTL;DR: This game might look good at first but it pretty much takes a dive within the first few seconds of gaining control of your character(s) and plays like an absolute brick. The story is paper thin, the "zombies/monsters" are laughable, and the dialog, while well acted, is typical RE ♥♥♥♥♥. My suggestion is to give this game a pass until at least two more episodes and a veritable crap ton of updates and optimization fixes are released because otherwise you're paying for a terrible gaming experience. Save your money for now, my friends.\n\nSCORE: 3/10","February 26, 2015","false","4.0"," 32 of 57 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","32","57","2","0"

Horrid frame skipping and lagging in the campaign mode to the point where it is practically unplayable, even with no enemies on screen. Raid mode ran fine until I got to level 3, where the game tried to spawn a street full of enemies (a common occurence in Resident Evil games), and the game outright crashed. It really looks like the PC version of this game was an afterthought, and it shows all over the place.\n\nUntil the numerous problems are dealt with, I strongly do not reccommend you buy this game for PC.","February 26, 2015","false","21.4"," 25 of 44 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","25","44","0","0"

Not saying any resident evil had an absolutely perfect story but at least some kept you wanting to play, this is not one of those resident evil games.\n\nTLDR: Game bad, no like old game, Raid good fun with friend if have one. It only worth it on discount.\n\n\n\nThat being said let's look at the other aspects of the game.\n\nChampagne:\n\nCombat: About the same as any other resident evil, it grows as you progress but ultimately becomes a game of annoyance with slow reaction times and twitchy bullet sponge enemies.\n\nWeapons; You start out with your standards and it’s best to keep with them any gun you find will likely do less damage and hold frwer rounds, I honestly dont know why they bothered adding any extra weapons in the campaign I didn't swap one of my originals out the entire playthrough.\n\nEnvironment; I enjoyed the look of most of the maps the designers really did a good job this time around. the only thing I disliked was how the colors didn't change much from inside to outside. it was all a vague brown red with black.\n\nSound; I think the soundtrack and sound effects were spot on, even at times i jumped a bit when enemies entered or chased me because something about the sound actually put me on edge this time around which is something that hasn't happened in a long time for a Resident Evil ( looking at you Nemesis).\n\nChampagne; 4/10 it wasn't that good at all, by the time I finished I was more relieved that I didn't have to play it anymore than anything. Really Capcom lets go back to Resident Evil without a partner.\n\nRaid Mode:\n\nIts fun with friends and a good challenging action game as long as you keep your lvl matched to the map that is. its not that fun solo unless you just want to grind to beat your friends score, well if you find that kind of play fun that is.\n\nRaid mode gets a 6/10 only because it didn't start with online Co-Op because an action shoot-em-up cluster **** is the only time you want a partner in Resident evil.\n\nAll together I think its an ok game definitely get it on a super sale if you're on the fence about it full price is just a joke for this one.","July 28, 2015","false","74.4"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","13","21","2","0"

While I don't really intend to coop this offline I do find it disconcerting that it seemed to be advertised as such until the last minute.\n\nMy real complaint is that my HD 7770 is well above the recommended requirements to run this game...and it runs poorly.  It LOOKS good, but it doesn't play good, especially in the campaign.  I didn't even get far before I stopped playing.  It's simply too big of an issue to ignore with how obvious it is.  RAID mode is a little bit better, but there's still issues there.  I'm not sure if the game is actually running in slow motion, because it seems the movements for enemies is slowed down for some reason...it's hard to tell if that's just how the game is or if it's related to performance issues.\n\nEither way, it's unacceptable that this game be released in such a condition.  I rarely preorder games anymore unless I feel they would be a "sure thing", and in all honesty, RE4, REmaster, and RE6 all run just fine my PC.  I didn't think I was taking a risk by preordering this game.  I won't be making the same mistake twice.  Is there a way to get a refund/return the game?  Because honestly that's how broken this game is.  And it shouldn't be.\n\nUpdate:  3/30/2015\n\nSo, it's been over a month since this game came out, and while updates have improved things, the game still suffers from frame rate issues and stuttering.  In the campaign it isn't as bad as it used to be, and seems to level out save for changing areas (the PS4 version has a similar issue but not as bad).  Raid mode is a crapshoot and typically the framerate is still jerking and stuttering for seemingly no reason.  Some missions it's less, some it's more.  The game is playable in the campaign with this, Raid mode less so.  And yes, I updated my drivers, messed with my settings, re-installed the game, and it's STILL having these issues.\n\nWhat's pitiful is that this is marring what is otherwise a damned good game.  On the PS4 I actually enjoyed this game much more than I expected to.  Bu tas it stands I still can't recommend this game with the performance issues it has.  It's playable, but I feel ripped off that this game came out in such a state.  I stand what I said before, and I will not be pre-buying another game for a LOOOONG time from Capcom, or Steam for that matter.","February 25, 2015","false","85.0"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","26","46","0","0"

She's still a bad-♥♥♥ but her attitude and personality is different (also the new voice aint bad but I realy wish the Degeneration voice actor was her voice actor in this game).\n- Game is WAY TOO ACTION ORIENTED.  Not once did I fear I was gonna run out of ammunition and the stealth gameplay should not of been there.  The stealth on its own is fine but it makes the game far too easy and helps in saving ammo that you already have too much of to begin with.\n- Barry's scenario had practically no backtracking and frankly the game is far too linear overall.\n- Since you always have someone following you, you will not feel any horror.  Don't buy this game if you're expecting some "survival horror".\n- My PC is beast and Raid mode staggers a lot and feels like my fps is really low (less bad in the campaign but it's still a problem there, especially the staggering).\n- Raid mode has some micro-transactions involed (not anything that ruins the experience but still annoying).\n- You may now revive yourself if you die in Raid mode if you have some crystals left.  This makes certain missions far too easy.\n\nVERDICT: Man what a disappointment......... if it wasn't for all the bugs and lack of offline coop then I would have probably been happier with the game.  Resident Evil NEEDS to go back to its roots.  Having someone following you all the time removes the horror, the entire game should revolve around backtracking and unique puzzles to solve, the perspective of a 3rd person shooter NEEDS TO GO, and overall Resident Evil Revelations 2 is a step in the wrong direction.  Still getting all other episodes so hopefully the game will redeem itself.  Even if it did, doesn't change the fact that would mean a quarter of the campaign wasn't too good.","February 27, 2015","false","53.9"," 28 of 50 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","28","50","2","0"

Followed by one of the blandest boss fights in the game. Its the ustank boss from Resi 6 basically. (anything reminding you of that game is not good)\nEpisode 4 is decent but the tie ups to the storys plot feels kinda weak.\nhonestly the campaign is average at best and the extra episodes are not worth playing\n\nSo WHY would i reccomend the game to you if the story mode is a strong 6 id say,\nRAID MODE thats why.\nthis is where the majority of my hours come in, around 32 and ive just "beat" the main raid mode missions\n(but unlocked more to do)\nRaid is much improved from the last revelations. it involves going into a mission area and having to kill all the zombies in the level to proceed. doing a mission gives gold and xp. gold can be used to buy new weapons and add cool upgrade parts to them.\nparts and weapons can also be found in missions, crazy parts to add to guns like fire/ice ect bullet types, burst fire,life steal, damage amps, there are so many crazy ways to add on to weapons making them super powerful.\nxp lvls up your character, higher level missions have more crazy foes with crazy variants and boss types. when lvling you unlock skill points to spend on skills like diffrent grenade types, melee damage, powerful attacks, and so much more. different characters have diff skills and lvling up skills improves them and when maxed can be used on any character.\nONE even unlocks a freaking samurai sword that replaces normal melee its so much fun to use.\nIve played so much raid and i really think its worth checking out and really is the meat of this game.\nat least buy episode one and check out the raid maps that come with that and see if you enjoy it.\ndidnt expect to spend so many hours in this game, somehow you did it capcom.\neven if i had to unplug my internet to play while it was glitched (over 100 friends on steam would make raid crash unless you went offline first FIXED NOW).

Then Revelations 2 was announced (just for information, i've bought handheld Nintendo 3DS just because of RE Revelations with Jill). I was excited, happy. After first trailer, still great. First information was talking about more characters coming back, but also that the game will be divided between episodes. I was not fan of episodic games (most of episodic games has 1 episode per month or more, so i was afraid cause of that, but then the developers said that every week will bring new episode, which is pretty OK for me). I have to also say, i am a fan of classic RE games (static corner cameras, RE 1-3), but for story i've played all of RE games (RE5 and RE6 only for co-op, as i did not like RE6). So yeah, i am big fan of Resident Evil, ever since i saw my father's colleague to play RE2 on his PSX :) And also big Claire's fan, so maybe this review is slightly affected with that.\n\nBut back to Revelations 2. I didn't know what to expect from this game, but i've preordered it. I was afraid that it will be more action game than horror game. Well, locations are pretty scary, but there is also a lot of combat, so it is OK. Cutscenes are fine, but one thing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off right from the beginning. Claire. Her voice. I mean, i was expecting Alyson Court's voice, as she dubbed Claire in RE2, also in Code Veronica, Operation Raccoon City, the movie Degeneration, but she does not dubbed Claire in Revelations 2. This new voice, there is nothing bad about voice acting, it is good, but i just wanted "classic" voice, i was used to :) Also the look of Claire, she looks different a little bit. I was in love with her since RE2, and then i fell in love with her again in Degeneration. But now, she is little bit uglier. Nothing bad on that either, she still looks amazing, and i still love her :)\n\nOK, enough about Claire, there are 3 more characters that we can control. Every of them has some special abilities and also skill tree. Real weapons are for Claire and Barry, other two characters cannot use pistols and weapons, only cans or rocks. But they have other special abilities, like Moira's flashlight, which can be used to blind enemies, or to find hidden items and ammo. Also, you are always controlling two characters "at once", i mean, Claire is always with Moira, Barry is always with that little girl, Natalia. You are controlling one of them, the other one is controlled by PC, but you can switch between them. That is something new for me, even when the same thing was in RE5 and RE6. But as i mentioned on beginning, i was playing RE5 and RE6 only in co-op with my friend, so i was not used to in co-op play with PC. But for most of the time it was OK.\n\nI can remember that i chose some hardcore difficulty, because i wanted some challenge. It came earlier than i expected it. Yes, i am talking about controls. It feels, ehm, horrible? Most of RE games i was played on PSX or PS2, so i was using controller, but those last games were pretty fine on keyboard as well. This wasn't. I've died few times in the first scene with monsters. Then i decided to lower the difficulty. Well, i died there as well. I just rage quit. After few hours i gave it another try. I've survived and i could continue. But i was afraid of some boss fights because of that controls. Nothing to worry about, you will get used to it. But you have to try it few times. After an hour it is OK then :)\n\nGraphically it is not totally perfect, but game looks great, and i love visuals. And some scenes are really scary, i think it is the first time i've seen something really scary in RE (i mean everything except monsters). Atmosphere is also great, lot of scary passages, and i think that breaking this game into episodes was really good move. It keeps you in tension after each episode, and it is even "worse" (in good meaning) when you have to wait another week to reveal what will happen next (but yeah, all episodes are already out now, so you can play it all at once, without waiting :) ).\n\nAbout the story, well, just read the description of this game, then check the name "RE: Revelations", and if you've played Revelations 1, you know what to expect. If not, well, there are some revelations ;) And it is worth to play it. Especially if you love RE world.\n\nSoundtrack is also very nice, it creates great atmosphere, or just add another level of (in)sanity to the game. All sounds are pretty nice, i can't really complain. I was mentioning voice acting of Claire, but i think it is OK with other characters as well :)\n\nThere are also some "bonuses" in this game, like new game mode (RAID mode, which i did not play, so i can' really review it), some extra episodes, which are fine. So there is a lot of content for 20 euros (or 30 euros for Deluxe edition, with those bonus episodes, and costumes, etc).\n\nSo, yeah, game is worth for those money, especially if you are RE fan or Claire fan. Only 2 cons - Claire's voice actor is not Alyson this time, and then controls (i can recommend to use controller, but you can also learn to use keyboard and mouse, with a little patience). Other than that i am really happy with this game (i was really afraid that this game will be bad), i can recommend it, and i hope we will see Claire soon in Resident Evil 7, or at least in Resident Evil 2 remake ;)","February 10","true","17.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Frame drops, crashes, there were problems. Now that the whole game is released in it's entirety I'm glad to see Capcom have fixed many of the problems that plagued the game at the start.\n\nResident Evil Revelations 2 put you in the shoes of Claire and Berry, fan favorites from the classic era of Resident Evil. You're joined by Moira,  and Natalia as secondary characters, who help you find hidden objects and to solve puzzles. The buddy system is something I'm not a huge fan of. The AI isn't great, and often stand around and take damage. From a mechanics perspective I wasn't a fan of having an AI partner the whole game.\n\nLuckily for us, the poor AI partner doesn't do much to sully the overall experience. The game is well paced, and throws you into scenarios and presents elements that might be reminiscent to older Resident Evils, something that I really enjoyed. The story is also something I really liked about Revelations 2. Though I feel Moira and Natalia to be something of a chore to play with, they are welcomed additions in terms of narrative. These characters are less like super agents that are so prevalent in the RE series, and more human. You learn more about these 2 and how they're involved in the situation. They're also not shoe horned in, the story's main motivation is from these 2 new chanters. The Story of Rev2 also explores a bit of the series origins which was something else I appreciated.\n\nThe game also offers a lot of value as well. For $25 you can expect around 12 or so hours in the main campaign, then an additional 2-3 hours in the bonus campaign. Then there's also raid mode and unlockables which has potentially unlimited play. This is not a bad deal purely from a value proposition.\n\nI feel like the game being released episodically overall hurt REV2 in the end. The first episode was by far the most uneventful and it was pleagued with technical issues. If Capcom released the game in full, and in an optimized state that it is today, I feel like there would of been much more excitement for Rev2, and more positive reviews. Capcom literally put their worst foot forward on this one. It's a shame because the game as a whole is actually quite enjoyable.\n\nPros:\n- Well paced campaign\n- Great story (for RE standards)\n- Great bang for your buck (good value)\n\nCons:\n- Poor AI\n- Releasing this game in chunks (IMO) hurt it in the end.","March 30, 2015","true","165.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

While the 5th installment are a delight to play but with a few flaws here and there. 6th was 'okay'.\n\nThen along came the revelations. As the name suggest, it was almost like a capcom had a revelation making this.\n\nRevelation 2 despite a not-so-big budgeted like the 6th, delivers a solid survival horror experience.\nThe graphics are great, at least for me compared to 6th (5th being the best-looking visuals for me). The enemies look very detailed and terrifying, not to mention disturbing. The details on the character is also well done, the animations still lacks a bit but didn't bother me that much.\nThe sounds are well done, you can hear the breathing of the enemies (didn't know zombie had to breathe) makes you cautious and gives the game the atmosphere it needed.\n\nand then we got the character mechanics. while the 5th and 6th had a partner that can also carries gun and deals significant damage to the enemies, Revelation 2 brush that off and leave the partner as a support. They didn't carry a gun, but they had their own mechanic such as focusing flashlights to blind the enemies and make them vulnerable, and even sense their 'presence' or locate their weaknesses and points you where to shoot. I won't spoil who are able to do that , you'd just have to find out yourself in the game (trust me, it's more enjoyable that way). Also you can switch characters if you're playing alone.\n\nNow, I played the hardest difficulty from the start, and I must admit after few deaths I started to think I bit more than I can chew. But, after understanding the controls, and the mechanic of the characters can do to dispose the enemies, it was a blast to play. Ammo and healing items are scarce, and when you do find more, it almost felt like a blessing.\n\nOfcourse, you cannot leave the flaws that this game had. First episode was a bit short. The keyboard controls a little bit confusing, it takes time to get used too.\nThere's framerate drop here and there, I heard it was worse the day this game launched. Now it has been patched and mostly stable.\n\nAs Resident Evil fan, this title is very recommended to add to your collections, at the very least try episode 1.\nAs a gamer overall, this is a satisfying survival horror experience.\n\n8/10","May 16, 2015","true","20.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

I dont know why, but it made the game a lot better. (Ive always been suited to a stealthy playstyle)\n\n- There are very many unlockables for Raid Mode and Story.\n\n- Moira is a beast with the crowbar\n\n- These devs put in everything we asked for, a couple minor jumpscares, you have to act quickly and think about how to get out of certain situations\n\n-You can use a lot of objects in this game to your advantage in surviving.\n\n- Headshots actually do what you expect.\n\n- Raid Mode is very fun, I havent had this much fun with an RE game since Outbreak 2 or RE Zero\n\n- Crafting system is pretty good, not complicated or anything special, but its simple.\n\n- Weapon Upgrading system is the same as it was in the first revelations (Gathering boxes of parts)\n\n- Theres more then one ending to this game, so more reason to go back and replay campaign.\n\n- The game is more survival based, along with the story instead of it being like the previous games where you rush. (Group working together, always finding out the new enemies you're going against)\n\n- Pretty fun boss battles\n\n- Claire's new voice actor, makes Claire seem more grown up, matured and battle-hardened.\n\n- I really like the perk system, nothings all that over powered and makes the game much more fun.\n\n- You can use Moiras flashlight against EVERYTHING to your advantage  (Against what you guys have seen so far in their campaign anyway)\n\nNegative things about the game:\n\n- FPS drops in the first part of the story mode (About 30 minutes into the game after getting so far, my FPS stayed at a solid 60) (Also bad FPS drops during episode 3 - Claires/Moiras part)\n\n- (Please fix) It bothers me when I play this game and Claire/Barry arent walking on smooth ground so they look like human vibrators.\n\n- Not much to do in the game (As of right now) All the episodes are not released and have to wait a week per episode.\n\n- Each Episode released ended on major cliffhangers.\n\n- No Co-Op is a downfall, but not a major rupture to the game itself. (Its being implimented soon)\n\n- FPS drops on start menu? That shouldnt be.\n\n- I dont know if its just me, but when I double zoom a sniper rifle my FPS goes to ♥♥♥♥.\n\n- Sometimes story gets predictable.\n\n- Not many characters. Was hoping to see Leon and Chris again to < but thats not really a big deal.\n\nMy over-all vote on the gameplay. 8/10\nVote on the story. 8/10\nVote on detail and immersive-ness 7/10","February 26, 2015","true","32.9"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","23","41","0","0"

I was very hyped and aniticipated a very well made Co-op game that i could enjoy with others online or offline LAN, but sadly i got neither. The single player consists of a useful character and a walking talking flashlight that will do absolutely nothing to aid in finding items or fending off enemies unless you take the time to switch characters with them, which then leaves your useful character sitting in the corner grabbing their ankles and waiting for any enemy to take their turn. The story itself seems like it would work well, but the graphical optimization of the game makes it absolutely painstaking to follow without wanting to chuck a brick at a characters face. If you like Resident Evil go ahead and save your time, frustration, and money by just going out and downloading a psx emulator to play any of the orginal games. I rate this overall at 2/10 for lack of quality performance, misleading consumers and fans into a game that seems to still be in development since you couldn't even release the online Raid Mode, and lastly for making a little girl with a brick the most useful character in the game.","February 25, 2015","false","13.6"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","12","20","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/recommended/287290/","klarden","Kain Klarden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/","1232 products in account","This game isn't bad, that's not what "not recommended" means. I just truly find it hard to recommend this to anyone - whenever you are a survival horror or action fan, if you're a Resident Evil series fan or RE: Revelations 1 fan... Even if you are a hardcore Barry Burton fan, like I am, I just cannot recommend this game.\n\nIt feels like Capcom completely misinterpreted why people liked Revelations in the first place. So, if you liked the main parts of that game, that worked "metroidvania-ish", like classic survival horror, and hated linear action sequences - I have bad news for you, because guess which parts Revelations 2 consists of? The game is balanced out to be less annoying and action-heavy than those chapters from Revelations 1, and there are new mechanics to play with, but still - not exactly what people wanted. Also, those new mechanics make the game feel more like a reimagining of ObsCure 2, rather than Resident Evil. Which isn't *bad*, just, you know, not Resident Evil.\n\nOverall, the game is just jumping from "servicable" to "not good", never really hitting the spot of "good", but never falling into "bad" either. First two episodes provide some interesting gameplay and locations, but are rather light on the story, while last two episodes try to tell more of the story, but start failing in locations and gameplay with very boring looking places taking a lot of game time and emphasis on "puzzles" (read "slightly to very bs for Clair" and "busywork" for Barry) in the third episode and just rushed feel of the last episode. Extra episodes are not that great either, with Struggle having a lot of very boring action and one interesting mechanic of "use food for restarts after death", while Little Miss is just a clunky stealth-only episode. Both provide interesting elements to the story, but aren't very fun to play.\n\nRaid mode, another thing people loved about Revelations 1, now feels more like a F2P tie-in to the series with super grindy gameplay, microtransactions and more emphasis on arena-like short stages, rather than the 4th Survivor/Operation: Mad Jackal-type gameplay the first Revelations Raid levels sometimes evoked. Also, while it is interesting to see levels from Revelations 1 and RE6 reused in Raid mode along with some player characters and enemies, it feels more like a cheap solution rather then a nice idea which makes the "F2P game" feel even stronger.\n\nWhile playing I felt, like the developers didn't really know what they wanted to do with this. A lot of it feels like a reuse of Code Veronica ideas, game sometimes uses very RE1-like imagery, but then does something very distracting - like putting a mansion-like location and then using very RE2-3 sounding music on top, that evokes a completely different thing. The only thing the game does actually good is the characters - Claire and Barry feel like you'd expect them to be. There are cool references to the main character relations (Jill writing to Barry after RE5, Claire talking to Piers about Chris) and previous games. So, the, so to speak, "main lore" of RE series is done right.\n\nThing is - you can read and watch this best thing, without playing the game. And playing the game is not very worth the time. If you somehow get it for cheap of free, and are a RE fan, and have some time to play - sure, why not give it a go. But if you feel like you're getting to the point of "maybe I should drop this... but what if there's something good after?" - if you got past episode 2, then no, nothing good after.","July 12, 2015","false","29.3"," 32 of 59 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","32","59","0","0"

Graphics may not be up to par with previous titles but that doesn't really matter... The controls are good.... The environments have the scary vibe you would expect.... The performance is really a hit or miss and parts of the game can feel unpolished but that is expected for a game with a slightly lower budget and being another crappy port from CAPCOM.... Raid mode is a huge improvement over the first game with more organized enemies... The story will make you ask for more in its current episodic state but it also makes you appreciate each section and not rush through the game with the different characters....

I was so excited for Resident Evil Revelations 2, the sequel to the first Resident Evil Revelations which was the first Resident Evil game I got into. Capcom killed the pc port upon the release of the game which rather disappointed me. Luckily they eventually fixed all stabilization issues with lag spikes that were occurring across majority of peoples PC's. Now that we got that formality out of the way, it is time to discuss the game in its entirety after I just beat it last week as of writing this review.\n\nStory: The story takes place in a prison. You are thrown and trapped into a prison by the evil head behind all the grief you will find as you play, going from area to area in Resident Evil Revelations 2. The storyline is completely separate from any other Resident Evil story line out there in its own right and regard. Capcom created this side series as a response to people that wanted a more survival horror based Resident Evil game as opposed to pure action.\n\nYou start the game as Claire in which you are going to a lovely dinner get together with people you know, and then in comes some type of swat team in the introduction of the game. The eye is a symbol of evil relating back to Horus’s day. It symbolizes that there is a person behind the chaos that further happens. That is as much of the story as I can reveal without spoiling too much.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are the best yet I have seen in a Resident Evil game. Mostly I favor the graphics because I enjoy horror games that throw me into a prison or asylum. The Island which you arrive at when you first start playing as Barry Burton is very pretty with light reflecting upon it. This is where you first meet the new character, a little girl named Natalia whose parents were killed at the Terragrigia incident.\n\nGameplay: The controls are fine, intuitive and no complaints.\n\nPartner AI System mechanic: My only complaint to this game is the partner system. Many times if you don't play as Moira, she will not shine her flashlight always to where you need to go. This gets incredibly frustrating especially in hallways where all you can see is darkness. Some enemies you have to shine the light on with Moira's ability to blind them so you can hit them. If you don't do this on the new enemy the Iron head. More than likely even if you melee him, you will have a quick death.\n\nScary? Yes and no. I play horror games quite often and intend in the future to replay some with another play through. Some moments gave me scares though.\nPrimary areas I got scared at or at least my heart felt tension. There are more but these are just the ones that gave me the largest amount of intensity.\n\n\n1. The Swamps: The swamps was one of the most chilling environments for me. When I looked at the swampy water and the choice between one through three options for tunnels to go down. I inevitably thought of Outlast. I thought of the dreaded game Outlast where Chris Walker would stalk me from the waters beyond what I could see. Don't fear though, enemies don't jump scare you in these swamps.\n\n2. The Final Boss: I will not spoil this. There is just something though about Japanese horror films and games that stick especially with makers behind the Resident Evil franchise. The boss is more scary then Laura; which is the multiple legged long-haired woman spider that is covered in blood in Shinji Mikami's successful, The Evil Within. This final boss battle ignited my heart with tension and reminded me why I play horror games through and through.\n\n3. There is one invisible enemy called the Glasp. It is a huge genetically modified insect. I can't pinpoint what insect in real life it would mimic.  This enemy is so annoying because you are not able to always see it as it makes a horrible sound like a huge bee coming at you. If you don't shoot it in time, it is an instant death.\n\nNew features:\n\n1.  Wristbands on all the characters. The wristbands show you the character's response to fear and other emotions as you travel through this game. It is the most brilliant idea to be implemented in my personal opinion towards a horror game. Resident Evil and Outlast got me into horror games. Nonetheless it deserves my rating of a perfect 10/10.\n\n***Note*** When I pre-ordered this game a month in a half before release I was very disappointed that everyone had problems with massive choppiness, lag; including some teleport lag here and there and massive framerate drops. Luckily now through all the patches they released early on this year, the game is polished and runs smoother then butter.\n\n2. Lastly for notable new features, this game is released in episodes. You can buy each episode separately or buy the whole season for full price. There are also two extra episodes you can get if you purchase the full package.\n\nIf you want a good horror game and are in the market for a new one to try out, go with Resident Evil Revelations 2. Raid mode is a very good time with a co-op partner. You can go all the way up to level 100 per character.\n\n3. If that is not enough, they have also included a countdown and invisible mode to test your speed and then your accuracy with enemies you won’t always be able to see when they are coming for you. That should add to the scares if the main storyline does not get your blood, adrenaline pumping and also some slight tension with slight jump scares possibly depending on who you are.\n\nGame rating: A+\n\nScale : 10/10","November 30, 2015","true","46.9"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","3"

Its only $6, like a meal at wendy's or something, so I figured why not. I loaded up the game expecting awful frame rates and expecting to dive into the graphics menus to fix it. Instead I was greeted with gorgeous cutscenes and a FLAWLESSY running RE:R2. Played for almost 2 hours so far, and havent had a single frame dip or freeze.\n\nGameplay wise, its certainly fun and intriguing so far, but so far im not as hooked as when I played Resident Evil Revelations for the first time (3DS hipster player here), which is easily one of my all time favorite Resident Evil's (didnt play 1,2, or 3 so I cant compare it to those, sorry). It has some very intristing dynamics. You constantly have 2 characters, whether it be Clair and Moira, or Barry and Natalia. You can press tab to swap between the two. Barry and Clair are the offensive ones of the pairs. They do pretty much all the fighting. Whereas Moira and Natalia can find hidden objects, like herbs, ammo, etc and reach or open places Clair and Barry cant. Overall its a pretty cool mechanic that im enjoying so far.\n\nI havent tried raid mode yet but if its anything like the original, it will be fun if your just in the mood to blow apart zombies and mutated humanoids.\n\nOverall, I think capcoms done a great job. It sure isnt The Walking Dead kind of engaging where it hooks you and makes you want to finish the entire game in one go, but its definitely intriguing, entertaining, and enjoyable to play.\n\nMy PC specs for those who want to compare: Nvidia GTX 960, 16gigs of ram, i7 haswell 3.4Ghz.","March 9, 2015","true","2.5"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","22","40","0","0"

This game is released with a four episode campaign with episodes released at different dates. This allows you to follow the story over time like a Telltale game. However, there is a bit more action involved here. There are four characters you control in all, two sets of two. Barry and Natalia, Rachel and Moira. All characters need to be used to complete episodes. Moira and Natalia have unique abilities that you use to get past certain obstacles. The graphics are quite nice and although you move along a mostly linear path, there are secrets and items scattered around to find, increasing the re-playability. You also have difficulty modes and an invisible and countdown mode for each episode. The story fits nicely into the Resident Evil universe and you will care about the characters on their journey.\n\nThere is an additonal RAID mode that allows you to fight infected of different types and levels. This is where the game should shine. However, at the time of writing there were a few issues with this:\n\n1) I have to play in offline mode, as a soon as it tries to connect to server it freezes or crashes. This is workable, but hopefully it will be fixed at some point soon.\n2) There is currently no online multiplayer, when added the experience will be twice as good.\n3) A split screen mode was promised and then removed at last minute. However, they have promised to look into this and offer something to compensate (no idea what at the moment).\n\nBasically this is a great game for fans of the Resident Evil universe and there is a lot to keep you interested. You might want to wait until they fix the RAID mode before getting it though.","February 28, 2015","true","21.8"," 42 of 79 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","42","79","4","0"

The controls are tight, the graphics are good, and the plot is more compelling than any RE game in the last 5 years.\n\nPROS:\nA unique soundtrack.\nA surprisingly functional partner system. Both Moira and Natalia have logical, well-implemented functionality.\nMore "classic" looking zombies.\nA lot of eastereggs/in-jokes for long time fans\nFantastic dialogue.\nLimited ammo drops.\nThe island has a fitting atmosphere that actually makes you fear the next group of enemies.\nThe graphics are good, but clearly not the biggest concern of the developer.\nThere's an interesting plot that compels me to play more.\nCo-Op! Finally!\nA lot of throwbacks to the older games in terms of level design towards the end.\nThey finally patched the framerate issues.\n\nCONS:\nOver-expensive, unnecessary, day one DLC (such as sexy costumes and storage space for Raid Mode weapons/items).\nHealth bars on the zombies in raid mode feel out of place in a Resident Evil title.\nThe twists in the plot are pretty predictable. They're still fun and entertaining, but they're not as surprising as they could have been, and in some cases the plot spoils itself with heavy handed foreshadowing. For example:  By telegraphing Moira's death so early, did they really think they were doing anything other than confirming that they'd have a fake-out death instead? That, and they had already advertised her bonus episode.\n\n\nOn the subject of Raid Mode:  If you liked the previous incarnations of Raid Mode or Mercanaries Mode, then you're going to like this.

I didn't even know of it's existence until I stumbled across it by accident. And now I know why.\n\nIt's painfully generic. The shooting mechanics are okay, but aiming feels floaty and inaccurate. Like the previous Revelations, you still don't get a health bar, meaning it's still difficult to accurately gauge how much health you have left. Making the screen pulsing and red doesn't tell you if you can survive one more hit or two more hits. As well, like the previous Revelations, there's still a scanning system. To find the majority of the ammo in an area, you have to stop and painstakingly scan each individual room. It kills the pacing like nothing else.\n\nAlso, half of the things in this game are copied from other horror and action titles. If you squint your eyes enough, Barry Burton's campaign looks a hell of a lot like The Last of Us, only even more profoundly ♥♥♥♥. You'll find enemies where you have to shoot limbs off, Dead Space style. Only in Revelations 2, instead of shooting limbs to weaken enemies, you're forced to shoot limbs off to make a random glowing weak spot appear. And you'll groan when you come across Pyramid Head copies.\n\nRE games are hardly known for their original and creative stories. But, Revelations 2 does the 'missing person' plot better than Revelations 1 by leaving the state of the missing party's future ambiguous, instead of showing them being completely fine. However, the story is hamstrung by terrible characters and awful writing. The one-liners are just awful.\n\nTo boot, the PC port is very sketchy. Even on the highest settings, the textures are blurry and muddy, and environments are flat and simplistic. The game really does look like a spit polished 3DS port. Even then, that doesn't excuse the framerate problems every time you exit a loading screen, and framerate problems for any map with weather effects.\n\nAlso, have fun trying to work past a lockpicking minigame that requires controller rumble when you're using a mouse and keyboard.","July 7, 2015","false","13.3"," 31 of 58 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","31","58","3","0"

Out of the half hour that I ran the game, I spent almost half trouble shooting, looking for reasons why my computer wouldn't be running this game smoothly. Unfortunately, the issues aren't on my end. Capcom did a weak job on the PC version here. I can't even review the gameplay or story, because in it's current state it is unplayable.

The raid mode (at the time of writing this has yet to recieve it's co-op) is a fun mode where you level up characters, guns and go through maps from different games (RE6 and Revelations 1).\n\nDownsides are that performance is an issue to the point that you can't really play the game, like you could be playing in one area with 60+ fps and then suddenly "Oh no a fire effect" shows up and then you're now playing at 30 or less fps. If Capcom ever fixes the performance issues in the future with patches then I highly recommend picking this up.\n\nEdit: Apart from the game stuttering when you first load for like the first 5 seconds of firing a gun the FPS issues are no more.","March 12, 2015","true","65.0"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","18","33","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beszedits/recommended/287290/","beszedits","The Revenant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beszedits/","111 products in account","REV2 IS THE BEST RESIDENT EVIL GAME SINCE RE0 (2002).\nYes, it suffers from random frame drops and stutters here and there, but they are slowly being fixed.\n\nBesides that, I have to congratulate CAPCOM this time. (it's the first time I do this).\nCapcom nailed this one.\nIt seems to combine the best of each past title, especially RE5 and RE1-3. I hated how action-oriented RE5 was. But now they managed to get the best of what RE5 had and blend that into the RE1-3 atmosphere.\nThe graphics can look a little 2009ish, because this game problably had a low budget at its disposal, although that's not a problem for me at all.\n\nThe MAP system is great! One of the things I most hated in RE5 was that the scenarios were too straight forward, no multiple doors to choose from. Therefore, the game didn't need a map.\nIn REV2, you can actually get lost if you don't have a map. And fortunately, they kept the REV1 map style, in which you can only see part of the enviroment and are not able to open the whole map. This increases the sense of claustrophobia. Worked very well in Queen Zenobia and is working on this too, especially in the prison.\nHOWEVER, this game can be pretty straight forward sometimes, just like RE5.\nExample: Episode 2 of Claire's campaign. You need fuel and a battery to start the helicopter's engine. Instead of forcing you to search every room in order to find those (maybe solve some puzzles to get them, like in RE1-3), the game simply point out where they are in the map for you. This is pretty boring.\nBut let's get back to where I was. Which elements REV2 got from the past titles? See below.\n\nThings they got from RE5:\n- Partner moves (Like Claire giving Moira a boost so she can climb a broken ladder; Just like Chris and Sheva used to do - it adds a lot to Co-op)\n- Collectible gems or precious items.\n- Breakable boxes.\n- You can give itens to your partner.\n- Fast enemies that make you feel desperate. This feeling is increased by the almost-tank control.\n- Can switch between characters to go through certain parts.\n- Can use the herb with one button instead of going to inventory.\n- Story is split up into chapters/episodes (Actually, this is not a good point from my point of view, but I'll let you decide. Personally, I prefer open world style. If you agree with me, then buy RE HD REMASTER here on Steam before buying this one).\n\nThings they got from RE1-3:\n- Puzzle-like gameplay. Need to restore power of machine - engine is missing - find engine - restore power.\n- Super limited line of sight increases the horror factor, especially when the enemies are so fast. U feel helpless. It works just like the outdated tank control.\n- Good scary moments. I almost peed in my pants in the first 30 minutes.\n- The workbench works in a similar way to the chest in RE 1-3.\n\nREV2 has some unique elements as well, like finding gun parts during campaign (in REV1, you could only do that in Raid Mode) in order to improve your arsenal. These parts are all inside chests with interesting unlocking system.\nAnother thing that I liked is that they not only kept the RAID Mode, but made it better. And let's be real, RAID is much better than Outbreak and Operation Racoon City.","February 24, 2015","true","55.9"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","23","43","0","8"

If you are  a veteran of the Resident evil series you might be a little disappointed since its not many jumpscares or overall feeling of dread. The game is mostly action which is ok but i prefer the resident evils with more horror elements. But im glad to finally play as Claire Redfield again last time i played  her was in Code Veronica X, And ofc the good old Barry! The new char Moira is also fun to play with, same goes with Natalia. The game is worth the 40 euros on steam but if your not sure you will like it you can just buy episode 1 and try it out, overall i would give the game a 7/10 not my favourite or most enjoyable resident evil but it was ok.","March 31, 2015","true","86.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is intriguing and the characters are well-written and have actual arcs and development.I've seen some complaints about the graphics, but I think they look great for a low budget $25 game.  The dialogues are still cheesy at times, but they're self-aware, including some nice references and throwbacks to the old games.

And finally a proper RE that focuses on horror more than action. (but ironically delivers a better gameplay engine for action-origented moments than RE5 or 6, or 4 for that matter)\n\nIs Rev2 perfect and everything we want from an RE game? No, but it's still pretty damn good for what it is. It's certainly a good foundation for this series to turn around on. If they can leep things rolling in this direction going forward, RE may yet return to the top of the horror genre.\n\nDark, creepy enviroments. Actual zombies that don't wield guns and ride motorcylces. No obligtatory daylight mow-everything-down action sequence.  Pacing that is fast enough that you don't get bored, but deliberate enough that it is unnerving. A story where there was clearly some passion for trying to create interesting and unique plot. Enemies that actually look scary and can be scary to deal with. And arguably the creepiest final boss RE has ever seen. Silent Hill level unnerving if you ask me.\n\nThen there's Raid mode. Which is a million times larger and better than Rev1's. Everything you loved from Rev1 but more more more. More levels, more weapons, more parts, more chars, and now skills added the system. (lots of active and passive skills to choose from, which can dramatically change how you play depending on your combination)\n\nYes, the performance issues and lack of offline co-op was incredibly stupid. But that has since been patched. Though I still urge Capcom to give PC players an exclusive gift to properly make up for those mistakes. Doing what you were supposed to do in the first place doesn't count as an apology. But giving us something exclsuive like No Mercy modes for Campaign and Raid... that would make up for how you initially gave us the shaft.\n\nI really want some kind of No Mercy mode anyway because if there's any gripe I have, it's that I wish the game would throw more enemies at me some times. This game has the best gameplay engine RE has ever had, but it's kind of wasted on the fact that the game usually throws only 5 or 6 enemies at you at one time. I want those intense moments where there are like over a dozen zombies running at me, and more just keep coming as you kill them. (let me experience craziness like the opening for RE3) So c'mon, add some kind of No Mercy difficult for Raid or something. You owe us something exclusive for botching the PC release. Going back and doing what you should've done in the first place doesn't count.","March 28, 2015","true","165.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am talking the original playstation resident evil and even the remake. Was not a major fan of 3s run around and shoot nor the new major action focus of the recent games.\n\nThis one I feel hit it right on the nail just like Revelations 1 did. The audio is amazing, the story is what I would expect from a typical corny resident evil feel and the dialog is priceless along with references back to the first games and even the new ones. There are moments you have to flee, you need to conserve ammo but not a ton if playing normal or lower, there are a few action sequences and most cut-scenes can be skipped. I would recommend this for any fan of the slow paced puzzle focused resident evil games since it does start to get puzzle focus more in episode 2 and a lot in episode 3.\n\nAs for raid mode...I really can't comment...a lot of people love that but I am not one of them.\n\nThis is surprisingly not super hard but it does have its moments. Sadly Co-op online is not available but they did just get co-op offline as in split screen enabled. The frame rates are not an issue for me but my machine is a top line editing machine just recently built in the last year for video editing. I do notice where people complain but if your machine can handle what most ports from Xbox 360 or ps3 have then I feel you won't have much of a problem.\n\nThe best way to make sure is look up the requirements and make sure you are above the minimum if you intend to buy this for the pc.","March 11, 2015","true","53.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Episodic structure seems to work fine in story mode, as characters working in pairs. The story isn't the strong point here, as usual, and the appearance of that particular voice actress from SH series doesn't do much to help. Also, these quotes from F.Kafka are WTF material in general, and not really meaningful inspiration. The dialogue is on par with usual RE B-movie horror style, although if you're an English native, Moira's teenage millennial bits will probably make your ears bleed. The environments have a bit of a Silent Hill vibe, which is nice.\n\nThe controls (gamepad) are solid, and so is the gameplay. The Story can be challenging, even on Normal difficulty, and you have to conserve resources to survive. I tried the Countdown Mode, and the Invisible Mode as well, but I found it way too punishing. The Raid Mode is really addictive though – more interesting than Mercenaries, with all the leveling and RPG grind mechanics, despite most arenas having been ripped from RE 6.

My computer is on the higher end of things, well exceeding the recommended settings, but it's been dropping frames like crazy, stuttering, and there's a weird glitch that makes the screen pan in and have a border for no reason.\n\nHOWEVER, with all that being said, I am INCREDIBLY SATISFIED WITH THIS GAME.\n\nPros:\n-RAID MODE\n-Engaging story\n-Interesting split character mechanics\n-Smooth controls\n-Old school Resident Evil kinda feel\n-Barry\n-Gun customization\n-Allied partner regenerates\n\nCons:\n-HORRIBLE PORT at the moment, will drop frames no matter the specs in resource heavy areas\n-Claire's first chapter borrows HEAVILY from The Evil WIthin for no real reason\n-One monster looks blatantly stolen from silent hill\n-Sometimes rely to heavily on jump scares even when they don't make much sense\n-Abilities present in previous installments are not available until you "level up" your character\n-Allied A.I. is incredibly dense at times\n-Micromanaging between characters can be a bit ridiculous at times.\n\nAfter playing through both the campaign, and raid mode fully, I can safetly say this is worth a buy at the 27.50 I paid, FOR RAID MODE ALONE.  While the story mode can be incredibly grating  with your native abilities taken away, you get used to it.  Once Barry's first episode kicks in, things get much better and a lot like the resident evils of old, sadly, this is mostly exclusive to Barry's campaign and Raid mode if you wanna stretch it.  Claire's is still enjoyable, but you'll have to run through the episodes a few times before her's gets reasonable.  They brought back the oldschool "what you do in one scenario affects the other" mechanic, both big and small.  So if you miss some floor items or a few twinkling bits, you'll get most of them as Barry later.\nRaid mode is pretty muc old school time attack without a timer most of the time, but you get to play as a bunch of character, and there's a neat level up system along with the gun customization system in the standard game.\n\nUnfortunately, this is an awful port, and there's a LOT of slowdown present on most rigs regardless of specs.  Most f the time it'll stutter for a while on first start of the level, but then it'll even out.  Unfotunately it'll do this every time a raid mode map is opened, or when you pass a certain point or retry a section of stage.  It can be unplayable at times, but it's still quite good, especially for the cheap price.\n\nAll in all, it's  a return to resident evil's roots, but it's still a bit awkward and it borrows, or straight up ripps off of the more respected and successful titles of today.  If it's around 30.00 for all stories and bonus raid mode characters, grab it.  It's well worth it.","March 8, 2015","true","104.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There's a fine mixture of puzzles versus exploration and some clever moments fused with equal amounts of frustration that create much satisfaction once bested. Some elements are a bit wonky and could be better polished in terms of control, but in general the game serves its purpose and is easy to pick up and play for newcomers and vets alike.  There's ample variation when taking into consideration the two extra episodes which focus on stealth and team based combat making a well rounded package that's cheap and reasonably polished. Whilst there are some moments where nothing seemingly happens and enemies appear sparse, when they do jump out there's some neat gameplay mechanics (more-so in  Claire's campaign) to give the game is own identity within the long running series. Whilst it doesn't re-invent the wheel, it's a pleasing and gratifying game offering some interesting concepts, an engaging story with some familiar faces. If you're a fan of the series then this is a no-brainer and well worth checking out. Action fans will also find some entertainment here although might find some of the puzzles interrupting the flow a little. If you can ignore the abundance of cheese in the last moments of the story and bask in the game's extra content you'll find a worthy game to add to your collection.","March 21, 2015","true","36.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/acclaim33/recommended/287290/","acclaim33","TheAcclaim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/acclaim33/","314 products in account",""The canon ending to this game is the best ending in the Resident Evil series EVER."\n\nStory This game exceeded my expectations. I didn't have much faith in the story mode and only bought the game for Raid mode. I can say in all honesty, this is arguably the best story since RE 4. Characters are interesting and Moira is a blast. And don't worry, these developer seem to be in touch and know what made Barry so great 20 years ago. He hasn't changed a bit and it's great. The episodes are paced fairly well, and if you're a fan of the RE series since the original then you will appreciate every reference that is made until the end. My goodness, the canon ending to this game is fantastic by the way. I won't spoil anything but I was left with a smile the whole day after I completed the story. The canon ending to this game is the best ending in the Resdient Evil series EVER.\n\nGameplay Gameplay has imporved since the first Revelations which played alot like RE 4. Revelations 2 plays more towards RE 6, but with smoother controls and animations and the FOV is much better. The game is both playable on mouse and keyboard as well as a Pad. I personally use a pad for these types of games, but that is just preference. During the story mode, you're able to swtich between two characters at a time (Claire and Moira/Barry and Natalia) and this is a much welcome feature. No longer do you have to deal with the A.I. being dumb as you can quickly switch to them and help their situation if need be. The character swapping is a lot like Zero and it adds a dynamic to the gameplay other titles have been lacking since Zero. Gunplay is nice and responsive as you are able to crouch and shoot and we fianlly have a dodge feature that is easy to use to avoid enemies and attack with skill. All in all, gameplay is great.\n\nRaid Mode In Raid mode, you'll be running around shooting enemies till they drop or defending your base crystals from on coming hordes. In many respects, Raid 2 is different from the original Raid. You still get random weapons, but you have to open chests to find them. You still level up, but each character has their own level. Raid mode is a ton of fun, just like the original and you could find yourself spending hours just playing Raid 2. My only complaints for Raid 2 is the unnecessary insertion of microtransactions and it's DLC model. DO NOT support the MC and DLC aspects of Raid 2. You will never need life crystals, just restart the mission and take the exp you earned before you dropped dead. You don't need to buy guns as you can earn them in game. The other thing to note is that Raid 2 uses a lot of RE 6 stages. I mean A LOT. You hardly see the game's title content in Raid 2 and thats a shame as the levels here are more interesting than RE 6 was. Besides those gripes, Raid is a blast.\n\nMusic and Sound Since RE 4, the music of past RE titles have been forgettable in my honest opinion. The music in 5 sounded very generic and 6 I can't even remember apart from the tracks they use in this game. That's not the case in the Revelations series. The first game had a great soundtrack and the second is no expection. In fact, I feel Revelations 2 exceeds the first. From Theme of Barry to Lost (Enhanced Ver) the music is beautiful and a lot of the score reminds me of Code Veronica which is great. My only gripe is Raid mode's selection which is very short on tracks and you will often here the same music over and over through out the missions including selections from RE 6. The sound effects of the game are improved from the first Revelations as well. Guns sound as they should with powerful pops and blasts. The voice acting is top notch and the new voice actress for Claire has won me over (I still miss you Alyson Court). Overall, Music and sound is great.\n\nPerformance/Port At launch and it's first month you could say this game was in beta. In fact, I'm convinced early adopters who purhcased the game as the episodes were coming out were beta testing the game. Performance was awful with framrate drops in both story mode and Raid. Characters would stutter like they just drank a mountain of 5 hour energy and slow downs would throw off your aim in crucial moments. Thankfully on it's retial launch week, March 18th, we got a performance patch shortly after and it fixed almost all the issues allowing me to write this review. Framrates have gone to awful to good with steady 60fps on all high and the stutter is all but gone. It was a night and day difference as I was an early adopter and it's a relief and a joy to play the game as it should be played. Performance was saved and it's good.\n\nConclusion For being a budget title, Revelations 2 has far exceeded my expectations. The story mode is just fantastic and any RE fan will adore the many references through out. Barry is just as amazing as he was 20 years ago, and it's nice to see Capcom as well as the developers acknowledge what made him so great to begin with. Gameplay is nice, responsive and smooth and Raid 2 is overall a blast to explore. Music is fantastic with memorable tracks and performance has thankfully been fixed. If you enjoyed the first Revelations, you will more than enjoy Revelations 2. If you haven't played a RE title then this is a good game to get into. If you rage quit the series after 6 then I say welcome back as this is the game you're looking for. Overall, Revelations 2 and the Revelations series proves it's ground in the RE universe and I would dare to say it surpasses the main line from 5 and 6. For $24.99 (Complete Season) or $39.99 (Complete w/Extras) you can't go wrong and I highly recommend this title to fans and new commers alike. Hopefully after it's shaky launch, this game succeeds and we get a third entry. Here's hoping for Rebecca and Billy!\n\nI rate games on a scale from Bad, Good, or Great and Resident Evil Revelations 2 is Great.","March 21, 2015","true","53.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'll make it short. Fantastic, dense atmosphere, some really evil jumpscares which I did not see coming at all,  there's enough ammo in the game but you have to make sure you're not wasting anything and use your melee weapon(s) from time to time. Combat feels solid, the story is fantastic (well at least for a Resident Evil game it really is top notch) and the characters are really likeable. For me, especially the (playable) support characters who do not use firearms. As a nice little side effect this makes the game so much more interesting.\n\nPlaytime for me was about 15-18 hours, including the two (DLC) Extra episodes. And my god, those two Extra episodes were great. While The Struggle was kind of a Single Player Raid Mode experience, Little Miss just blew my mind, it was a different gameplay experience, had a ton of fun.

I feel like the game needs at least one of these to truly shine.\n\nThat being said, RE: Revelations 2 is an enjoyable experience both in Campaign and Raid mode. It was fun playing as the different characters+also switching between them in order to find items, get attack combos, or for exploration in general. I particularly thought it was ingenious the way the partners complemented each other. Moira can blind enemies for Claire and Natalie can point out enemy weaknesses for Barry to exploit. Switching back and forth to create these effects felt really cool in terms of strategizing and dealing with enemies in the most efficient fashion.\n\nThe campaign is indeed very actiony, but I was glad that it included horror elements. Barry's and Natalie's storyline, in particular, had some really intense scary moments that put me on edge. This was compunded by the fact that I was playing in hard mode, which made it very friggin' difficult for me to manage my ammo and health item usage efficiently. It truly did feel like Survival Horror despite the fact that its style is more similar to a third person shooter rather than a classic horror game.\n\nRaid mode is a lot of fun and I haven't grown tired of it yet, nor do I think I will for a while; the level and skill progression system ensures this. There's always something to look forward to after each level up, whether its by using skill points to level up skills or by finding out that you've unlocked a new active or passive skill slot to use. It's also fun to mess around with all the different characters available, given that each has his/her own skillsets and level progression. It's definitely a great mode to have fun with. It really is a shame there is no online co-op, though.\n\nThe game does have its downsides, too. Like DLC. It is indeed annoying that there is so much day-one DLC when it feels like there really shouldn't be. Thankfully the DLC doesn't include anything that's truly crucial, most of it is just bonus stuff that just makes the game easier. It does suck that we have to pay for costumes though. I wish they could have just been unlockables like they've been on previous games. Why Capcom? Why?\n\nAll in all, though, I was pretty satisfied with the game. Despite its issues I still think it is a worthy addition to the Resident Evil series.","February 25, 2015","true","92.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I had a lot of performance issues due to playing on a laptop but that's expected for me by now. After days of testings out different settings and constantly having to switch my graphics around, I got it so it works somewhat decent.\n\nThe story was on par I feel if you compare it to the story of the first Revelations. I enjoyed the connections to the FBC, Morgan Lansdale, and Terragrigia. For YEARS I've been wanting a game with Claire and Barry since they're my all time favorite characters with Claire being an absolute badass and Barry being that doof with bad jokes but a hell of a father. I enjoyed the character development within Claire and how worn down she has been throughout the years. She lost her touch with dealing with children and her appearance is also very hardened. Barry's still the doofy dad with the cheesy lines but the dedication he has for Moira is touching.\n\nOnly thing I wish this game had was more information about Alex Wesker. Her relation with Albert was known but how about those family ties and what sort of relationship did those two have? I feel like more development on her story could've been very interesting. As a very long time fan of the series, this game..for me, did not disappoint and I highly recommend it. It is a little more on the short side with it taking me about 7 hours my first playthrough. Another point I want to add, this game is difficult. In my opinion, Barry's half of episodes are significantly more difficult if you compare them to Claire's imo. I think this and Code Veronica are the most challening titles in the franchise but the challenge makes it more rewarding when you do progess into the story.","June 26, 2015","true","87.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","3"

Instead we have a game with wonderful atmosphere and some nice environments (especially towards the end of Barrys campaign) and what promises to be an engaging story. Also with Capcom selling the episodes individually it's quite cheap to dip in and see what it's like.\n\nLooking foward to Episode 2.\n\nReview after finishing episode 2/4:\nEp2 significally ups the ante in both characters sections, with some meaty story hooks and a new more open map in one section akin to the village from RE4 or Evil Within and a pretty good character/boss fight that gets some satisfying development and back story. After episode 2 I am enjoying where the story is leading and the dynamic between the games main characters as well as it's secondary characters.\n\nReview ater finishing episode 3/4:\nClaires campaign is the one that shines in this episode as we learn more backstory to the characters and especially Moira herself. The episode mixes some good story telling with a lot simplistic puzzles which brings a certaint something back that old school Resident Evil fans will have missed. Some of the action sequences in this episode certainly throw Claire and Moira through the grill but it's worth it to experience the end of Claires segment which is the best the game has been so far. Barry's section on the other hand kind of gets a little less love this time around. While there are some touching moments in this episode for Barry, it's let down by the fact that half of it is just carrying a big box around. Still, the episode overall is great and the game continues to impress.\n\nReview ater finishing episode 4/4:\nClaires Campaign takes the sideline this time around with it clocking in around 20 mins and only having any story development at the very start and very end, good but nothing that they couldn't have added at the end of the last episode for Claire. Barry on the other hand brings his A game this time around with his section lasting around 2 1/2 hours on my playthrough. Barrys section features a couple of puzzles and a good variety in locations with the pinnacle being a throwback to Resident Evil 1 near the end. The climax has some good ideas in terms of trying to change up the stale boss fight formula and gives Barry one of the greatest moments in the whole game. A satisfying end to an overall good package.\n\nThe 2 bonus episodes also reveal a couple of things from the main campaign that aren't explained so to get the overall story playing these is recommended.","February 26, 2015","true","19.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/recommended/287290/","TeaSeeOh","TeaSeeOh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/","526 products in account","Is the ENITRE basis for evaluating or recommending a Resident Evil games these days really the lack of co-op play now? They could have made Resident Evil 4 co-op with Leon and Ashley, but did the lack of it make it any less of a great game? Of course not, no, so all the negative reviews and backlash on this aspect for PC is hugely being blown out of proportion. Does it suck big donkey balls I cannot play this with a buddy? Damn right! But does that mean it's a lackluster game by itself? Nah.\n\n"The decision to prioritise a single local screen was made to ensure a stable user experience across a variety of different PC settings and devices," Capcom said in a statement. "Raid mode will support online co-op shortly after launch when a free patch is available for players to download which adds this feature, but the main campaign on PC will only be available to play in single local screen."\n\nIs it bull? Possibly, but so far I'm enjoying the single player campaign for what it is. A Resident Evil experience, even if the series has taken a huge detour from their original course; And to be fair to this game, you're actually killing/fending off mutants/zombies, and not life-like people with parasites in their head. The loss of local, offline co-op is not that big of a blow to me overall. I'm more upset over the lack of online co-op than anything else, bu even the console versions lack online co-op for the campaign as well. Thankfully at least we'll be getting Raid mode online at a "later date", for what little consolation that is for those truly seeking some form of multiplayer.\n\nAt any rate...the game isn't all that bad. It's a lot more tense, in particular in Barry's campaign thus far, than any other recent Resident Evil game. When I was snooping through the forested area at night as Barry, I was legitimately moving slow, cautious to find something lurking in the bushes. Hell, something did pop out the bushes. I started spraying my assault rifle in the direction of the monster, missing a good majority of my shots because of the jump scare it gave me. I'm a big wuss though, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nInventory is a bit closer to older school Resident Evil games than the newer ones, but nothing like the Tetris we remember from 4. It kind of reminds me of Resident Evil 0 where you can pass items between you and your AI partner. As well, while we're on inventory, you can mix and match certain items for crafting purposes. Making improvised explosives, molotovs, disinfectant, tourniquets, etc. You can even provide the tourniquets or first aid supplies to your AI partner, allowing them to help you in times of need.\n\nSpeaking of the AI partner, they aren't complete dead weight like other games. I remember how much of a chore it was to babysit Ashley in part 4, but at least Natalia can defend herself with a brick or Moira with a crowbar here. You'll also find reasoning to switch to your AI partner to harness their unique abilities as well: Moira has a flashlight and can spot certain things Claire cannot, and Natalia is able to "sense" the enemies.\n\nStory and atmosphere seem very interesting thus far. I was thinking about writing something here, but due to the episodic nature of the game, any little bit might reveal more than you might want to hear. But it is keeping me interested, so I will continue to give it a go.\n\nOn the negatives, gunplay feels a bit loose, not really tight or precise like Resident Evil 4, 5, or 6. I find myself missing more times than I hit because of the ridiculously huge crosshair. At the least it has the basics we're used to at this point: shooting an enemy in specific areas puts them in a dazed-like state to perform a melee follow up, so getting a headshot isn't an absolute top priority all the time.\n\nSprinting also feels awkward, as hitting the button throws you into a sprint even if you let the button go. The only way to stop sprinting is by hitting the button again. Even if you attempt to stop moving, you'll still keep going for a couple more steps which could mean you run right into a trap or enemy by accident.\n\nMinor complaints, but may be bigger issues for others.\n\nThe big issue I'm having with it thus far, honestly, is the weird FPS drops in certain areas. Notably the beginning. When I first walked into this one room with a medical table with a light shining on it, my frames dropped significantly. That's kind of odd considering I should have more than enough to run this game smoothly. Poor optimization on a game that has very mediocre texture and geometry work is worrisome. The skybox is also incredibly poorly done, with a resolution that makes me scratch my head. I can see the jagged edges and pixelation in the image they used. Graphics don't make a game worth playing or passing up, but it is still worth mentioning.\n\nOther than those issues, however, I'm enjoying myself. So do I recommend it? Sure. And for $5.99? Why not, give it a shot. If you like it, purchase the other episodes and the Raid Mode additional add-ons afterwards if you want to get a bit of longevity out of it. Most of the DLC and "micro-transactions" people are incessantly harping over aren't even necessary to the core gameplay experience.","February 26, 2015","true","13.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Let's get the big number out of the way.\n\n9 / 10\n\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 9\nStory: 10\nPort Quality: 8.75\nPC Controls: 8.5\nContent: 10\n\nThis is an improvement for the series, it looks good, its gameplay is enhanced over Revelations 1, it has WAY MORE content, a minimum 40hrs was spent half assing collectibles and secrets so it's not a full completionist run, but still more than what most people do... but 40 hrs,  with a hell of a lot of other things to complete.\n\nThe story concludes in spectacular fashion and pretty much all the questions are answered by the end of the episode. Resident Evil has had some fun if crazy stories over the years but Revelations 2's story is one of the best in years. For the first time in a long time this game also has 2 endings a good and bad. There's not a lot I can say without spoiling the game but make sure you read all the files it answers a lot of the questions and as some nice call backs to past games.\n\nBonus Episodes: The Struggle and Little Miss are the two bonus episodes available for download there a fun change of pace from the regular game and have some gameplay mechanics new to Resident Evil. You don't need to play them in order to fully understand the game but they do flesh out the story more. Little Miss in particular as some really fun and creepy cut scenes.\n\nThe final batch of Raid Mode missions is fun and the new code red difficulty increases replay value however it was a shame not to see a Ghost Ship style mission from Revelations 1. You also get two new characters who I can't really reveal without spoiling the story but they're both fun characters one in particular as a great ability to make enemies fight each other.\n\nAs an added perk we also get some nostalgia in the form of Claire's RE 2 outfit and Barry's STARS outfit.\n\nRevelations 2 was a fantastic ride from start to finish it gave old characters a chance to have the spotlight and the story was without a doubt one of the best since Code Veronica. The graphics aren't the best and the game was clearly made on a limited budget but with fun old style Resident Evil gameplay and a brilliant story, not mention the addictive Raid Mode this game is easily worth 10 out 10","March 19, 2015","true","53.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","1"

The stutters stop after changing 1 whole menu option, and the game is perfectly functional and arguably much better in singleplayer. I seriously doubt all these people base their entire quality assessment on whether most games have offline co-op or not. It's just aimless, indignant rage, and rather than judging the game for what's actually there, they lob off some revenge reviews to tank its rating.\n\nThe game itself is very solid so far. For a budget game, it looks fantastic, with its rusty prison cells and pitch black forests. Revelations 1's interesting weapon upgrade system is back and expanded on here, as well as a new bomb-mixing functionality for throwing weapons. Both sets of characters have interesting dynamics, with one being the gun-man and the other being support. This works out in a surprisingly cool way, and somehow I ended up preferring to run around as a helpless child rather than armed-to-the-teeth Barry Burton. The combat is greatly improved from Rev1, now almost reaching the heights of RE4 in terms of feel. This is noticeable in Raid mode, which isn't online yet but has tons of potential and depth so far. There's a ton of ♥♥♥♥ to do in there.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if you're one of the people who tanked Dota 2's metacritic score because it didn't give diretide, this game may not be for you and your petty nerd-grudges.","February 25, 2015","true","19.7"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Presented in episodic form, the story rolls forward and brings variety that ranges from stealth to escape sequences. The supporting characters are more than just companions; they are part of a team because the player can control them at any time. The campaign becomes a collaborative effort and the complementary skills bring diversity. Splitting the campaign in half allows for some experimentation, as levels change based on previous actions and key areas are revisited. Online play is supported through a RAID mode that provides arcade inspired content as you level up characters and fight creatures in small battle arenas. Both the online and campaign modes employ a fair combat system that minimizes rigidity while maintaining basic survival-horror mechanics. This is a game that makes it clear that teamwork is about characters with complementary skills, and fear is an excellent motivator.\n\nRead full review[www.newgamenetwork.com]","August 4, 2015","true","18.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","2"

The game plays like a typical 3rd Person shooter, with the exception that the partner system is annoying at best and irritating during tougher segments. Enemies are fairly bland with the tougher enemies being straight ripped out of Silent Hill (play it and you'll see what I mean).\n\nClaire and Moira's Campaign segments can be playable...if Moira could be silenced. Her dialogue is annoying and it will grate on you throughout the entire playthrough. Otherwise its fairly dull and uninspired. Episode 2 picks up the pace a bit with the introduction of Claire's team-mates from Terra-Save. Sadly, the cliche's and predictability in story starts kicking in, that by when the big reveal happens in Episode 3/4 you find yourself saying "saw that coming a mile away."\n\nBarry and Natalia's parallel quest is FAR more interesting than Claire and Moira's. This could be due to not having to hear Moira's mouth. Though Natalia could be a little bit more useful that pointing out monsters. You'll find yourself using Barry more just to quickly dispatch enemies and using Natalia as a pack mule. I will say, Barry's campaign to find his daughter was more enjoyable, but the end leaves more questions than it answers. That being said, Barry ends up being unintentionally hilarious delivering his lines. The ending will leave you wanting more than what you ended up paying for.\n\nAs far as replayability goes, Raid more and the extra campaigns offer interesting challenges if you really start taking a liking to the game. However , if you're like me and are a  Resident Evil Fan, these extra modes don't really make up for the lack of a true finale. It will feel more like the devs are trying to squeeze extra cash out of your wallet rather than putting forth a product that engaging. The lack of online co-op in raid mode also makes this something you'd rather watch a friend play on youtube than to drop 60$+ for.","February 26, 2015","false","57.7"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

There is a good balance of action and survival/puzzle mechanics.\n+ Raid mode:  Greatly expanded upon compared to Revelations 1.  I can already tell that this will be where the majority of my playtime will come from.\n\n- Graphics:  Texture quality is far inferior to RE6 and even RE5 (a game that was released in 2009).  It looks like an upscaled game that was originally designed for a handheld, similar to the Revelations 1 port.  Revelations 2 was designed for consoles and PCs though so there is no excuse for this.  The contrast is also bad.  Dark areas are overly dark, and bright areas are overly bright no matter how you adjust the settings.  There are no proper Anti Aliasing options, the only choice is blurry post processing FXAA.  There is also a constant grain filter applied that can not be disabled.\n- Game stability:  I have had a couple of freezes when exiting the game that forced a shut down (couldn't even get the task manager to come up).  Others are reporting huge dips in FPS, I have had no problems myself after the second patch.\n- Lack of co-op:  As of release there is no story mode or raid mode co-op (online or offline).  They are planning to add online raid mode co-op eventually but there is no reason this shouldn't have been included out of the box.  This is a feature that Capcom outright lied about.  They advertised offline and online co-op up until the day before release and then changed the store page description once everyone started complaining.  This sort of false advertising is unacceptable business practice.\n- Microtransactions:  Want extra storage space for your raid mode gear?  That'll be $1.99.  This isn't an MMO, save files are stored locally so there is no reason for this.  This is just a cheap cash grab attempt.\n\nOverall the core gameplay experience of both Story and Raid mode are dank.  However, the lack of polish, false advertising, and microtransactions feel like a slap in the face and hinder the experience quite a bit.  I'm sure I will put a good amount of time into RE Revelations 2 mostly thanks to the raid mode but I can not recommend it at this time due to the glaring faults.  I will update this review if Capcom addresses these outstanding issues in a future patch.  Until then, this stank turd isn't worth the asking price.\n\n5/10 bomb nuggets.\n\nEdit:  Updated the stability section to reflect some recent problems I've encountered.\n\nEdit #2:  Updated the stability section again after Capcom broke the game further with their first patch.\n\nEdit #3:  Updated stability once again after patch #2.

Resident Evil HD Remastered has broken records for digital sales, and sold more copies in January than ANY OTHER GAME.  That is because the original games have an almost cult-like following that want the classic resident evil back.  Give us the option for fixed camera or over the shoulder.  Put back REAL puzzles in the game, that have you backtracking back and forth like a mouse in a cage.  CAPCOM LISTEN TO THE REAL FANS WHO HAVE BEEN WITH YOU SINCE 1996 !!

RE6 to me was nothing short of a absolute disaster. And RE5 was just gears of evil. While I did enjoy Rev 1 it had its moments that had me just annoyed and frustrated (on both 3DS and PC) but I LOVED raid mode.\n\nThat said...\n\nI have been Loving REV 2.\n\nSo far Ive only completed Clairs story and will knock out Barry's soon, but I had to dive into Raid mode and to my surprise I loved it even more.\n\nSo Campaign is a kind of shout out to RE roots with a shot and being atmosphirc and scary. Now while the scares are really just jump scares it has a very Evil Within feel to it and Im fine with that. Now as I played threw the story I did get a few of these framerate drops but they were few and far between eachother and by no means made the game unplayable. As for the AI its back with all of its stand in everything stupid glory. I found doing the game on survival Difficulty was borderline impossible due to the AI having their own Health this time around and being very adverse to shooting a freaking gun. That said I dumped down the difficulty and just sat back and steam rolled it to a pleasent start to a decent story looking foward to the rest of the episodes.\n\nNow Raid mode\n\nIt is sooooooo much better than Rev 1 first and formost the Maps. They dont just throw you into locals from the single player game no they toss you into locations spanning from from what ive seen so far RE2-6 which I love. The character progression is seperate this time around and the skill tress add for a nice addition to leveling up (btw Hunk SOOOO OP) the fighting is far more fluid and while the aiming took a bit to get used to Im pleasently happy with it as I havnt had any issues with getting Head shots. The Gun customazation has been awesome. Instead of just basic pierce and knock down you can add elementle affinities to your weapons (all the old stuff is still around) which again adds to a deeper custimization than the first.\n\nAll in all im 100% happy with my purchase and cant wait for Online to come out in 4 weeks so I can tackle raid mode with my friends. The AI is trash but that has been the case for years now nothing new to the RE series there (ashley was the only "decent" ai) Also Ill say the facial graphics leave something to be desired as when they talk their mouths just kinda flop all over.\n\nSo if you were a fan of REV 1 id recommend this absolutly. If you only enjoyed Raid mode with friends id say wait till all 4 episodes are out up to you but for sure pick this one up.","February 25, 2015","true","76.5"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

Then came Resident Evil 6 and I was like... huh, Resident Evil 5, not such a bad game after all... the co-op was nice... yeah... and Matrix Wesker wasn't THAT bad... was he?

Why does this game play like a tin man's ♥♥♥♥ trying to work a poon hole... ugh. CRAB PEOPLE!?! THE FAAAAACK!?\n\nThen I downloaded THIS pile of junk and was just like... no... HELL NO!

That's just laughable as all hell)\n\nJust stop complaining for the sake of complaining already and look at the pile of dung before you for what it REALLY IS. If the online co-op was bad you'd be complaining about that, so just settle the hell down.\n\n- The game chops up on a computer that should be putting the game on BLAST. I mean, this is unacceptable... the game could quite easily run on a handheld console no problem yet my gaming rig is having trouble with it? Something isn't right here. Inc. Patch.\n\n- Claire looks like a Tranny... which is a shame because Claire and Barry are both my favorite RE characters so naturally this game should of won me over... but no.\n\n- Barry looks like he's been through some intense radiation treatment due to having full blown cancer... Like why make him look so worn down and gross?

Cause I mean hey, nothing says survival horror like regenerating health and picking up treasure gems! The worst part is people pretending that this is some "return to form". A return to form in what capacity? Survival horror? How? In classic Resident Evil, running past an enemy always felt rewarding when you narrowly escaped danger, in this game, it just feels stupid everytime I do it. This over the shoulder crap just does not work for the kind of game they're supposedly making again - even critics know this with the glowing reviews for RE Remake and the tepid ones for this abomination.\n\nNo really, what is this ♥♥♥♥ing garbage? Some dude in Japan sees Last of Us and feels the need to copy it basically verbatim? Crouching? When the ♥♥♥♥ has that ever been a move in a Resident Evil game? (outside of a special move in Outbreak) TALK ABOUT INNOVATION! No, I don't want to see two idiots banter about everything I could deduce myself. Even the skid mark Resident Evil 4 understood that Ashley should ♥♥♥♥ off for awhile.\n\nWhat happened to you Resident Evil? What the ♥♥♥♥ happened to you? You started out as the finest in the survival horror genre, becoming Capcom's top selling IP by just being a scary horror game franchise. Then what? You devolve into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ action franchise (thanks RE4) when you so much as taste even further success. You mean to tell me, that despite beating Street Fighter and Mega Man in franchise sales, that you needed the series to appeal to even MORE people?\n\nI'm getting off topic. The gameplay sucks. The movement, the animation. It's all far too stiff and poor and doesn't gel well at all as an action game, let alone the supposed survival horror game the campaign is pretending to be. At no point does this piece of garbage ever feel like it's a title that could stand on its own, alone, separated from the Resident Evil IP. It needs the name to sell and it needs it for you to give a ♥♥♥♥ that that's supposedly Claire and that's supposedly Barry and that's supposedly Barry's daughter.\n\nNote to Capcom: If you're gonna sin and use the Burton name; put it on somebody that has personality, rather than a vacuous, empty shell in yoga pants. Nobody in the GOOD Resident Evil game ever felt the need to swear, yet this ♥♥♥♥ing Ellie wannabe curses like a sailor.\n\nThis game just lacks that Resident Evil tension. REMake HD came out just a while ago and it's still scary as the day it was made, and that's just some dudes house. Revelations 2 puts me in some rusty prison and I'm just crowbarring enemies, smashing boxes and crates like it's nobodies business.\n\nAnd Raid Mode... ♥♥♥♥ing Raid Mode. Mercenaries in RE5 is one of the finest side modes in any game out there to date, and Raid Mode shames even the concept of having a side mode in a Resident Evil game. It feels like I'm playing a mobile phone game. It would be laughably limp and pathetic if it wasn't also just a sign of the way the series is going.\n\nCapcom, if the whole point of this episodic design was meant to ward off people from playing further, then congratulations, you were successful. I have no desire to see more. If it was meant to SELL me on playing future episodes, then you can go shove it. You failed.\n\nOh wait the point of episodic content is that you can crap out bad episode after bad episode and hope people don't notice because you had delayed the schedule of release to guarantee an apathetic audience that will gladly accept complete garbage just because they're tired of waiting. (The Telltale model, basically.)\n\nResident Evil 4 is responsible for garbage like this, but everytime Capcom manages to make a worse game than RE4, I feel like I almost have to apologize to RE4. From RE6 to Operation Raccoon City, can it get any worse?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XHaDGCRMav8 Unsurprisingly, it can, actually.\n\nThe Pro's\n+Looks nice\n\n+You get a decent bang for your buck\nThe Con's\n-Story and characters just aren't interesting\n\n-The setting isn't scary or spooky\n\n-Bad as a survival horror game\n\n-Terrible as an action game","October 30, 2015","false","3.1"," 27 of 52 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","27","52","4","4"

Being able to find what you need is fair if you actually look for it.   The controls and settings for the controls, as well as display settings, are a toss up for me however!\n\nAiming and targeting are fine as well as the normal foward movement, which is what should be expected of any FPS.  I also find switching between characters to complete tasks interesting.  However, turning around on the spot is extremely sluggish.  I like to be able to turn on the spot when I have to go back to a previous position, not wait for what seems like 5 seconds for the character to turn around.  The movement should really be more fluent and easier to use.\n\nAlso I've noticed that the games crashed quite a few times. Not sure if thats a game or steam issue, or just my PC, but I found that my interest to play lacked because of it.\n\nAs for the control and display settings, when trying to brighten the diplay and increase the mouse sensitivity, I found that doing so didn't make any difference at all to display  or mouse movement.\n\nThis being said, the gameplay was fun overal, but could use a little more developmental tweeks.

Local coop has been added, optimization is fixed. Now we can play with our friends and won't see strange "lag" anymore.\n\nSo, this is a call for people who gave a negative review to Revelaions 2. If you DO like the game, please change your negative reviews on Revelations 2.\n\nGame wise, Revelations 2 is probably the best one in the entire RE series. Enemies are tough, and gameplay is hardcore. The voice casting is the best in the RE series. The plot is half Hollywood-ly generic and half intriging. The main characters feel REAL for the first time in the RE series thanks to the well-written scripts.\n\nSo if you love the RE series, and you want to a good RE game, play this one. It is now fully play-able and capable for local coop. It's got good gameplay, good characters, good plot, and a good ending.\n\nI changed my review from negative to positive, because the game has changed, from bad to good. If you love RE, you won't regret playing Revelations 2","February 28, 2015","true","65.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite having the recommended specs, my experience in the beginning was plagued with stuttering and low frame rates.\n\nSince Episode 3, it seems Capcom has patched those performance bugs and it runs great. It is certainly playable and I thank them for listening to fans, even though it took a while to fix.\n\nGameplay is similar to RE: R1 and keeps a similar feel. Honestly, the first felt more creepy than this one but the story is a bit more engaging since it doesn't split off with 3 or 4 different teams.\n\nI also like that there are multiple endings, which harkens back to classic Resident Evil.\n\nAside from the beginning performance problems, I enjoyed this game and recommmend it to all RE fans. Lots of playability and you get your money's worth with story mode, extra chapters, and raid mode.","March 23, 2015","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music is great, and it does feel scary on the first playthrough. Fighting new enemies is challenging when they come in packs, and also resources can be scarce when playing on high difficulty. New characters are interesting and likable (expect for Moira's swearing). Moira's inability to use firearm is not as frustrated as I first thought, and though Natalia can't use weapons at all her ability to sense enemies from afar is useful. There aren't many puzzles in this game, but some does require the corporation of two characters, or the unique ability of a character in some way. However, this create a problem in single player campaign on PC as there's no co-op, and continuously switching between characters does lengthen the finishing time. I don't have any issue with the graphics, I think it looks fine and I don't complain as long as the gameplay is fun.\n\nI personally think it is better than Revelations 1, The gunplay definitely feels better than the first game, and the episodic story works fine for me too. Raid mode is fun, but I always prefer the campaign mode. All in all, it is a nice game added to the RE series. I believe the future games will take the good ending as the canon ending?\n\nI'm glad that the frame rate issue and Barry's immobility in the final boss fight are fixed! Also, it would nice to view weapon/creature stats on RE net too.","March 22, 2015","true","46.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wasn't a huge fan of Revelations so I wasn't sure if this one was going to be any good. I wasn't even going to play it until I heard it was decent from a few friends and reviews. I decided that I'll buy the first episode and see if I like it. I was blown away. I truly felt scared at certain parts and they actually have a good balance between survival horror (Claire's episode) and action horror (Barry's episode). On top of that, I feel very invested in the story. Sure, it's still cheesy as hell, but the first episode (which, by the way, is all I've played so far, will update after playing the rest) ends with one hell of a cliffhanger that will definitely have me buying the season pass at some point. Highly recommend it to all RE fans, be they the newer generation who enjoy action horror, or the generation like myself who prefers the good old survival horror in the originals. If you're still unsure, shell out the six bucks and play the first episode at least.

Everything I hated about RE6 is absent in Revelations 2. It gives me renewed hope for the future of Resident Evil.\n\nGetting to play as Claire again in the main story was awesome, something I've looked forward to for a long time since Code Veronica. Moira, Claire's partner throughout the story, was a great new character that spiced things up and helped with some occasional comic relief. You learn to enjoy her banter after a while. It's hilarious, honestly.\n\nThe partner system in Revelations 2 was really well-utilized and fun. It reminded me of Zero's a bit, but this one is much faster. The partner characters also are more unique, in that they can't use guns and instead contribute to the team in other ways. You would think it would be boring to play as a character that can't use guns, but I found it refreshing.\n\nThe game has a nice variety of settings. The marketing for this game focused almost entirely on the prison, but that's actually just the first of many locales you explore in the game. There is even a mansion segment of the game that serves as an awesome throwback to RE1, complete with claustrophobic hallways and creepy paintings.\n\nOne thing I have to note - this game is really obviously lower budget, and you will have to lower your expectations with regard to visuals if you want to have a good time. The texturework is nothing to scream about, and the high-quality texture work seen in RE6 is mostly absent here. And, oddly enough, when they are present they are used where they shouldn't have been. For example, tree bark isn't shiny and glossy in the real world, but in this game, it often is... It gives the impression that the spec, bump, maps etc were hastily auto-generated to save time/money, not baked manually and professionally. It's almost as if Revelations 2 began as a 3DS game and was ported over very late into its development, because that's what it often looks like - a low-res 3DS game. There is also a disparity in quality with regard to polygon counts and other things. Sometimes you'll be in an area with really gorgeous models and then suddenly you'll be in another area with models that look like something from the N64.\n\nNone of that detracts from the experience too much though! Overall this is a fantastic addition to Resident Evil, and I recommend it to any fan of the series. Despite being a lower budget entry, it's EASILY a much better game than RE6, and I dare say even RE5. To me, Revelations 2 is the game that RE5 should have been, as a true followup to RE4. It takes what RE4 did, and innovates on it by adding some new gameplay mechanics not seen before in the series. Just a shame Capcom couldn't justify giving it the same budget it gives to the main numbered titles, because this game definitely deserved it.","May 27, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not just a zombie action shooter like much of resident evil 6. There are lots of puzzles, immersion and character development in the game alongside the classic resident evil survival horror genre interspersed with some action sequences where you need lots of ammo (that you should have been saving).\n\nThere are 2 endings of the game based off a cutscene with Claire / Moira  at the end of Episode 3. When you get there, look up how to get either ending if you want. After I played the game I wish I had known that and replayed Claire's episode 3, and Barry's episode 4 to get the other ending.\n\n\nCons:\nI have a fairly old CPU but fast SSD and Unfortunately the game still needs some bug fix/ optimization patch on PC for pre-loading / caching. To me, it seems that there are still things to preload, after the loading icon disappears, and your game may lag for 10-40 seconds while it continues to load. The lag does go away however, after this 'unfinished loading' is done. My suggestion is to run the game in windowed mode, so whenever you get loading lag, just pause game and do something else. The pre-loading will continue while paused. If you have a faster CPU, you'll probably have less lag, but my 6-year-old Q6600 @ 2.61 ghz quad core, was getting pretty much 100% CPU usage until this loading finished. I don't know of any fix for this yet but there are some discussions of it on the forum.","August 28, 2015","true","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphics\sound\control\gunplay were all very good. The FOV was borderline bad but just tolerable enough for me to not get a headache too often, no fix available either. The save system uses checkpoints but I never had an issue with it and it worked very well. I loved how the devs strategically wanted you to lead with the weaker character in order to find the goods, ammo/health etc. All the new characters were great additions to the franchise and of course the return of Barry is just badass, the story is very well done too. Definitely has a grittier feel and atmosphere then other RE games, felt more similar to Silent Hill or The Evil Within in my opinion. It has a much slower pace (which I prefer) than the previous action packed RE5 or RE6. If you are a RE fan DON’T miss this game. The only complaints I have are the lack of online coop, no FOV slider and the two bonus chapters are a little weak but do a good job of filling in the missing pieces to the story.\nPlay this game.\n","August 11, 2015","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Honestly, it was incredible - much better than the first Revelations, packed in just a couple of hours gameplay.\nI regret not pre-ordering this game, as the last few games in the series made me anxious about buying this one. After reading reviews saying that it brought back the classic, unique element of survival horror that the older games offered, I decided to give it a shot, and now I can say with a chill down my spine that this is the scariest game of the series, at least from what there's been in a while. Play with the lights out at your own risk, I started off on the Survival difficulty, which was a great experience.\n\nI would strongly recommend to any fan of the Resident Evil franchise, and to anyone who enjoys the horror/survival horror genre in general.","August 29, 2015","true","77.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite being more linear compared to the first game, it still encourages exploration and searching using Moira's flashlight or Natalia's ability to see certain things in the dark, which adds to the linearity making it a nice change of pace.\n\nUnlike modern RE games enemies don't drop items, but you have to find them on a fashion similar to the GENESIS of REvelations 1. However, customization of weapons is lacking on this title, due to pieces being extremely rare, by end game you'll probably use all of them on your guns, unlike in the first REvelations. The health system is the same, but it indicate poorly since it only adds the bloody effect rather than both a bloody and a desaturation screen effect of the first game.\n\nClaire's chapters 1 and 2 are a bit dull, 3 is good, it even includes a puzzle for extra stuff, although 4th is basically a escape from the auto destruction sequence we see on all the games so far.

It's not as good as the first game and it's not as creepy as it should be but it's a great adventure game with a gloomy atmosphere at its best parts. Playing with 2 characters at once and switching between them added some depth (There are scouting and fighting characters and you need both). It was fun to fight and sneak and to explore the well crafted levels. The crafting aspect felt a bit dull though. The graphics were still good and fitting, the sound effects and music were great. The story was well told. the characters were very likeable.\n\nThe quality of the 1st addon suprised me. "The Struggle" is a short story with Moira as main character and it features perma death. Especially on the harder difficulty level you`ll need a few tries to beat the game (Don't forget you can switch characters here too). The storytelling and gameplay are on the same level as the main game.\n\nI'd rate this game  2+.","July 26, 2015","true","36.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The save system uses checkpoints but I never had an issue with it and it worked very well. I loved how the devs strategically wanted you to lead with the weaker character in order to find the goods, ammo/health etc. All the new characters were great additions to the franchise and of course the return of Barry is just badass, the story is very well done too. Definitely has a grittier feel and atmosphere then other RE games, felt more similar to Silent Hill or The Evil Within in my opinion. It has a much slower pace (which I prefer) than the previous action packed RE5 or RE6. If you are a RE fan DON’T miss this game. The only complaints I have are the lack of online coop, no FOV slider and the two bonus chapters are a little weak but do a good job of filling in the missing pieces to the story.\nPlay this game.\n","August 11, 2015","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now I see that if both players have a really bad connection they wont be able to play together, but most of people have a decent connection, so it wont be a problem\n\nI am changing this review a lot.\nRaid mode pros:\n- addictive, lots of settings, not an epic ost but it helps to keep the fast pace, lots of characters and cool skins, rpg elements which are good.\n- the interface is quite friendly.\n- is fun even playing solo.\n\nRaid mode cons:\n- rpg means a lot of grinding, though it can be shortened with the soul eater weapon part, not so many enemies and barely final bosses (close to 20 different enemies, 5 or 6 more would help to keep it fresh)\n-  the fact that all the characters can have, through that grinding, any skill from the others. I would see more challenging that each character would have some skills available but not all of them (for example gina's set of skills fits to her, and same with the others), but cypher, I could understand it could have any skill.\n\nSumming up raid mode is great, it seems to me that it needs some changes, but basically the idea and execution is fantastic.","January 16","true","131.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game could have been so much more if it allowed online co op, as nearly all of the gameplay mechanics were pandering to co op play. Like one character being the support and the other being the gunner, one being able to spot enemies from behind walls and objects and the other being the obvious combat role.\n\nPlaying through it single player was extremely tedious. The game forces you to swap between them in certain segments as the AI itself is pretty much rigged to follow you (and often even fails at simple tasks like that)\n\nBut the atmosphere and spooky jumpscares and monsters were pretty great and for that reason I would recommend a playthrough of this game if it's on sale.","February 9","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CLEVERSLEAZOID/recommended/287290/","CLEVERSLEAZOID",":| The Wanderer |:","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CLEVERSLEAZOID/","218 products in account","As an old school fan of the Resident Evil series [culling the infected since '96], I have to say that this series has definitely had its ups and downs. I still remember the completely game changing shocker that was Resident Evil 4, shying away from the traditional Survival Horror we were used to. After that, the franchise seemed to have lost its way a little. Resident Evil 5 was atrocious, both in the way of the plot, and in the character development. [Chris became a giant steroid monkey, and Wesker loses it completely and goes over the top, a terrible ending to one of my favourite video game bad guys] Operation Raccoon City was a very enjoyable non-canon romp through Raccoon City during the height of the T-Virus that stood apart from the rest of the franchise. Revelations was an interesting game, and 6 was... okay. It had its moments, but felt like it was trying to be too many things.\n\nRevelations 2 however, hits the nail on the head. On one hand, you've got the ever brave Claire Redfield, sister to franchise protagonist Chris, fighting alongside Moira, daughter to Barry Burton, whom also was in the original game from way back in 1996. The two women have been kidnapped and are being held on an island somewhere near Russia, and are being monitored by someone called the Overseer as they try to find a way of escape. Unfortunately for the ladies, they are part of an experiment on a new virus called T-Phobos; a variant of the Uroborous virus, which is triggered in states of extreme fear. On the other hand, you've got Barry Burton himself, alongside a strange young girl named Natalia, trying to track down Moira and Claire on the island.\n\nEach campaign has a distinct feel to it. Claire and Moira's made me feel constantly under pressure; Why have you been brought here, what the hell are these things trying to kill you, and who the hell is the Overseer and what is her end game? It is a very fast paced campaign, with quick enemies, boss monsters o'plenty and a defined goal: Escape. Barry and Natalia's campaign is more a slower paced, creeptastic crawl through the horror. Shambling zombies [although some who can pick up speed quickly, and some with extremely long reach!], more firepower, monsters that change depending on how you previously defeated them as Claire and Moira [I'm talking about normal enemies, not boss monsters!]\n\nEach campaign has its own sidekick gimmick. Moira has a flashlight which can be used to blind enemies [setting them up for a strong melee knockdown] and can attack foes with her crowbar, whereas Natalia can sense and detect enemies through solid objects, and can throw bricks. [Don't knock the brick throwing, sometimes it's hilarious to hoss a brick at a zombie and watch it crumple] Each of these bring a different style of gameplay. If playing solo, you can jump back and forth between your character and their sidekick. So you can jump to Moira, use her flashlight to stun the quickly advancing Hammer Dude, so Claire can run forward, kick him to the ground, and you can quickly run up as Moira and implant your crowbar directly into his chest, weakening [not killing] him considerably. Whereas Moira can be a hindrance to her foes, with blinding lights and crowbar stuns, Natalia can be a very very helpful little lady! Using her ability to figure out where your foes are positioned can make for some very satisfying stealth clears, where it's possible to clear entire areas without being seen or heard.\n\nI suppose I should try and wrap this up, as I could quite easily write an essay on this game.\n\nAs a Resident Evil fan, I think it's a step back in the correct direction for the franchise [although this game does officially tie up the LAST loose thread of the entire Resident Evil story line, so perhaps it could be the last step before the 'reboot' that has been mentioned a few times]\n\nIt has a couple of jump scares, likable new characters as well as returning fan favourites who have been out of the lime light for some time. I didn't have any performance issues, and it ran surprisingly well on a set up that is 5-6 years old.\n\nDefinitely worth picking up, especially when it's as cheap as it is right now!","May 14, 2015","true","56.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Didn't really know this game had split-screen co-op nor did I really care for it, but I had two controllers anyways. Even after downloading the following episodes and other dlcs I never experienced any long loading times or crashes (then again, I'm running it on an SSD). I dunno about anyone's builds, but I'd look there and discern any possible problems there first instead of blaming the game instantly. Then the price is really aggreeable considering the entire full game. Most people are just afraid of buying something in episodes, which is not a problem. But when the full base game, all 4 episodes and even adding the 2 DLC episodes, are less than $30, and the deluxe edition (all DLC) IS $30... I dunno it seems like a good deal when even NOT on sale.\n\nThe story was engrossing and I'm glad to have bulk-bought the rest of the episodes after going through the first one. It was also cool to see and play as Barry again since... well more than a decade ago. Then Claire is always a welcome sight since growing up with RE2. The side characters, albeit only being mainly utilitarian in gameplay, still were a good hook into the story. Then having one duo trace the steps of the other gives that sense of constant care and vigilance even amidst the horde.\n\nThe enemies were okay. Not too bad but not the best. They could've had a bit more to them, especially after playing through raid mode a bit then finishing the game... But, of course this game has their unique One-Shotters. And yes a few retries have racked up due to their... persistence. But that's alright. That's what the side-kick is supposed to be there for, I guess. No big deal... Stupid invis!\n\nRaid Mode taking what it was in RERev and building upon it in good ways. Seeing all of those numbers: EXP, Gold, LV, HP, ATK. Seeing them increase is what really gives that mode its power and popularity. At least with me. I enjoyed the Mercenaries mode all the way back in RE3. I had bought the Mercenaries stand-alone game and Revelationsfor the 3ds and liked them. With their post-game stuff they want you to play more. Yeah they have little microtransactions in Raid Mode, but for what they get you, I'm positive I don't need them. Lives and extra guns and some parts aren't really worth it to me so I won't partake.\n\nAll in all, in my opinion, its a very decent game. I played through the main 4 episodes and plan on playing through the extras. I'd reccommend it to any and all who enjoy Resident Evil games, like a bit of a challenge, and/or are not opposed to the episodic style of this game's initial release. Oh and listening with headphones to the the story mode is reccommended highly. It will save you plenty of times. I guarantee it.","January 18","true","135.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not as good as the first game and it's not as creepy as it should be but it's a great adventure game with a gloomy atmosphere at its best parts. Playing with 2 characters at once and switching between them added some depth (There are scouting and fighting characters and you need both). It was fun to fight and sneak and to explore the well crafted levels. The crafting aspect felt a bit dull though. The graphics were still good and fitting, the sound effects and music were great. The story was well told. the characters were very likeable.\n\nThe quality of the 1st addon suprised me. "The Struggle" is a short story with Moira as main character and it features perma death. Especially on the harder difficulty level you`ll need a few tries to beat the game (Don't forget you can switch characters here too). The storytelling and gameplay are on the same level as the main game.\n\nI'd rate this game  2+.","July 26, 2015","true","36.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything I hated about RE6 is absent in Revelations 2. It gives me renewed hope for the future of Resident Evil.\n\nGetting to play as Claire again in the main story was awesome, something I've looked forward to for a long time since Code Veronica. Moira, Claire's partner throughout the story, was a great new character that spiced things up and helped with some occasional comic relief. You learn to enjoy her banter after a while. It's hilarious, honestly.\n\nThe partner system in Revelations 2 was really well-utilized and fun. It reminded me of Zero's a bit, but this one is much faster. The partner characters also are more unique, in that they can't use guns and instead contribute to the team in other ways. You would think it would be boring to play as a character that can't use guns, but I found it refreshing.\n\nThe game has a nice variety of settings. The marketing for this game focused almost entirely on the prison, but that's actually just the first of many locales you explore in the game. There is even a mansion segment of the game that serves as an awesome throwback to RE1, complete with claustrophobic hallways and creepy paintings.\n\nOne thing I have to note - this game is really obviously lower budget, and you will have to lower your expectations with regard to visuals if you want to have a good time. The texturework is nothing to scream about, and the high-quality texture work seen in RE6 is mostly absent here. And, oddly enough, when they are present they are used where they shouldn't have been. For example, tree bark isn't shiny and glossy in the real world, but in this game, it often is... It gives the impression that the spec, bump, maps etc were hastily auto-generated to save time/money, not baked manually and professionally. It's almost as if Revelations 2 began as a 3DS game and was ported over very late into its development, because that's what it often looks like - a low-res 3DS game. There is also a disparity in quality with regard to polygon counts and other things. Sometimes you'll be in an area with really gorgeous models and then suddenly you'll be in another area with models that look like something from the N64.\n\nNone of that detracts from the experience too much though! Overall this is a fantastic addition to Resident Evil, and I recommend it to any fan of the series. Despite being a lower budget entry, it's EASILY a much better game than RE6, and I dare say even RE5. To me, Revelations 2 is the game that RE5 should have been, as a true followup to RE4. It takes what RE4 did, and innovates on it by adding some new gameplay mechanics not seen before in the series. Just a shame Capcom couldn't justify giving it the same budget it gives to the main numbered titles, because this game definitely deserved it.","May 27, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Series veterans Claire Redfield and Barry Burton return to stop yet another bio-terrorism threat, along with new characters Moira and Natalia.\n\nGameplay wise, Revelations 2 delivers on the promise that the Revelations games would return to the series more survival horror roots. The relentless action of later main series entries takes a back seat in favor slowing things down and letting you explore each local for weapons, items, and resources, while still having some robust combat encounters. Exploring each area becomes necessary as enemies no longer drop ammo, all you get is from scavenging from the environment. There's also hidden items and shootable tokens scattered around, which further encourages exploration. Additionally, the game features a decent amount of puzzles that, while relatively easy, feel satisfying to complete. Inventory management is also a more prominent mechanic, as key items and pieces of combinable equipment are often encountered and fill up space quick. This direction in gameplay reminds me of the fine balance between action and survival mechanics in Resident Evil 4, which is part of what made that game great for me.\n\nOn the technical side of things, the game seems well optimized enough. I've read some negative things about it in that regard, I can't speak for when the game came out, as I waited quite awhile to play it, but it seems like most of the major issues have been resolved. I experienced some minor slowdowns when loading into a new area for the first time, but that's about it. The game has a decent amount of options in terms of graphics and controls, and while it's not as visually impressive as the newer main series entries, it still manages to look pretty good.\n\nOverall, I had a pretty great time with this. You get an impressive amount of content for the price: 4 main episodes that average 2-3ish hours each plus bonus episodes, along with a more fleshed out Raid Mode brought over from the original Revelations. Unlockable weapons, modes, and costumes encourage replayability, so with everything you'll get a lot of play time out of it. Personally, I enjoy the direction the gameplay is taking in this series and I hope they continue to make more entries in it. Highly recommended.","February 1","true","30.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This games progression & atmosphere feel more in the vein of RE4/5 and not the horrible later outings like RE6/Racoon City. However it is obvious the production value & feeling of being part of something bigger isnt there like it is in RE4/5/6, the story is a much more down to earth version with really minimal twists.\n\nThe 4 episodic format feels sadly like a poor excuse from Capcom at gathering in money in a different way, its not well balanced at all in its length like the episodes from RE5 or 6 which felt just right for people to end their game session, this game really needed a extra episode or some message popup when arriving at a new long section of the game like for example "The Sewers" or something. The episodes are way too long on episode 2,3 & 4 especially the ones with Barry/Natalia.\n\nGameplay alternates between and stealth quite often and actually gives you the feling of conserving ammo unlike RE6 which messed that part up. However the stealth mechanics in this game are rather weak and only really adds to slowing the game down way too much too often along with the re-arrival of one of the worst implementations in the RE Revelations games which is the "Genesis Scanner" from RE:R1 which had your character scanning walls and floors of cleared areas for items. This time its there in a slighlty lighter form by switching your character but is still a weak and annoying gameplay element due to not only taking away from the pace of the game but also making you feel like you are hoarding because you will use it in a game where you might be afraid the game doesnt give you enough ammo and might have to restart a episode & need the BP points in the game from jewels you find this way to upgrade your character throughout the game. Theres also some lockpicking bits to open up chests for items with Natalie/Moira, this seems plastered on and makes absolutely no sense in its inclusion besides again artificially extend a short game. While kind of fun the first 1-2 time the harder ones later on makes it impossible not to fail as there is no time to change your mind.\n\nThe core gameplay revolves around the switching between your 2 characters in each episode. It really screams co-op if you want to go through the game by yourself sadly due to many annoyances. First of all getting caught by enemies usually locks you up often with their moves which really infuriates you towards your AI partner and secondly the controls are just not very intuitive at all, and with 2 characters to manage it really feels like a artificial way of Capcom to implement panic moments and tension by relying on slow & poorly implemented controls. You never really ever throughout the game feel in control of your actions due to this. Im all in for a 2nd partner in the newer RE games as the dialogue between them and their environments add to the atmosphere and story, but the partner controls should have been left to the AI in singleplayer imo & for people playing it in Co Op.\nThis is sadly where i feel the RE: Rev. games fail, the partner controls are more of a pacekiller & an annoyance rather than giving you a feel of exploration and immersion it just grows old very quick looking at a barrel at a corner to see if something will glint that you can pickup all the time.\n\nOverall i can only recommend this game if youre going to play co-op, it is just way too slow alone with the partner mechanic, stick to the main series for the solo experiences imo. The story albeit easy to follow does idd feel like its been done before in the series and doesnt add much new to the series. The production value and variation feels cheap, there really isnt any surprises, its all the same type of areas you are accustomed to in the RE games with sewers,labs & construction areas. The enemy variation is surprisingly low and weak, theres like 5-6 types of common type of enemies throughout the entire game which really makes it feel like this game was quickly done and covered in its episodic format so people wouldnt notice these things. Theres only a few bosses and they require minimal wit and tactic which is really dissapointing as the 3D RE games usually require you to use timing and your environment often against the bosses. In this game they really only require you to move around all the time and shoot them to expose their weak points. The last boss in the game especially is action wise dissapointing, it barely does anything against you and just wanders around the level waiting for you to take it out of its misery.\n\nOverall i think its a decent entry to the series after the abonimation that was RCity & Re6 but it is also a game that indicates clearly that Capcom has lost their way and dont really know how capture the control and feel RE4 & 5 had, it feels like a mishmash between poor stealth elements and bad unintuitive controls to create fear & panic, whereas RE4 & 5 was all about the exploration & immersion of the new environments and encountering new types of enemies along with great cinematics and dialogue. This just feels subpar if you have played either of those and more like its a game thats going through a identity crisis, does it want to be Splinter Cell or Resident Evil ? If you play the extra episode in the game called "Little Miss" you will come to the conclusion that this will never be Splinter Cell no matter how hard it attempts though, that was laughably bad.\n\n7.0/10","February 6","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have beaten the game and here's my opinion/review:\n\nSure it def. brings back the creepy feeling of the first resident evil games and maybe even pushes past them almost more  towards silent hill in that regard, but b/c of people's griping about re6 I feel like this game has made steps backwards from re6 and suffers from that.\n\nDid re6 have it's problems yes.  I felt like it could of done the boss battles a touch better, it did feel a touch not interacive enough for those.  Also some of the characters kinda felt like their side of the story could of been better, Helena's side of some of the boss fights for example, she felt just stuck up on a ledge while Leon got to fight.   But!  Re6 had GREAT controls, and the game looked good and played good.   This game looks about the same or not even as good as re6 and it plays like trash.  It stutters and the character movement feels more like movement from resident evil 1 vs resident evil 6 (clunky which was ok for resident evil 1 when it came out but re6 made vast improvements on this).\n\nNo online co op mode for the campaign was a crappy idea, but the secondary characters feel more like an extra tool than useful compainions so I guess it's understandable-  It's a pain have to recheck areas twice just b/c one character can't see or pick up an item just b/c they don't have a flashlight/sixth sense.\n\nDon't get me wrong I loved some of the zombies in this game (even if they are too reused/as in the same exact models for alot of them) and it was def. nice not seeing a bunch of zombies toting guns, but movement of your characters?  Why?  Why back track on great controls?  I mean sure I get a little girl shouldn't be able to drop kick a zombie, but Barry and Claire?  They should be able to jump, slide, duck, roll, slide over a table just as good as Leon or Helena from re6.\n\nIt was neat using the little girl to see monsters, and their weaknesses to help Barry fight I will say that.  And the stealth kills are cool, even if they weren't implemented in the right ways (i.e. you need the little girl to see the orange globes in the creatures body parts to know the best place to take them out with the least amount of ammo, but all the sudden if you kill one from behind a knife hit to the back/stomach area always kills them? makes no sense.).\n\nI also liked that certain objects in the stages could be used to help you fight, i.e. shooting a fire extinguisher to help you see the glasps.\n\n\nSo in closing I guess my 2 biggest gripes are that the controls just don't feel tight anymore like re6 and the game plays like crap for what it looks like in comparision to re6 in certain areas.  Also the no online co op for campaign.\n\nGame does bring back the horror roots, some puzzles, but controls returned to clunkyness and the bosses felt lacking [not enough boss fights, some bosses felt uninspired and too reused (gray skined guy that has huge claw arm coming from his midsection/torso), never really felt like they had specific weaknesses, nothing cool required to beat them i.e. having to hold down jill in re5 and shoot the bug attachment on her chest and pull at it, no major death scenes i.e. snake eating you whole, chainsaw guy cutting your head off].\n\nI'm torn on whether or not to recommend this game.  On it's own I think the game stands ok at it's price tag so I guess yes, but as the next installment of resident evil I can't stand that they back tracked on somethings, and as much as it sucks to think for me personally if the future re games continue on this path I think I might just be done with the resident evil series.","January 28","true","57.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For the first month there were a lot of issues with performance and other bugs.  Since then the game was patched and works great now.  So that is why the game has low-ish recomendations.\n\nIt's a Resident Evil game, so the story is B-movie material but still enjoyable.  The campaign is fun once you get the hang of switching constantly between your characters, and picks up after the first episode which is really short compared to the others.  There are a lot of unlockables hidden behind high-rank playthroughs as always.\n\nRaid mode does some things amazingly well, but in other areas is a step back from Revelations 1.  The parts and guns system is amazingly additctive and more deep than it was in Rev 1.  There are a ton of characters, and the skill system allows you to play whoever you want and still have the bonuses you want.  The bad news is it lacks much of the fun levels and character that Raid mode had in Rev 1.  Most of the time it is just a small arena.  Also most of the maps are from RE6.  There are no hidden enemies, no hidden BP medals, no voice clips.  But there are emotes, lots of emotes.  And if you really get into it, I suggest picking up the extra storage DLC for parts and weapons.  It's $2 for each so it isn't that bad.  It's still additctive, but it is different from Rev 1 Raid.  There are enough unique skills for the characters to keep things somewhat fresh.  Some get pretty silly.\n\nI'd buy it if you like Resident Evil games for sure.  It plays more like RE4/5 and Revelations 1 than RE6.","March 25, 2015","true","184.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Where do i start? first off they did a much better job with horror in my opinion than they did in RE5 and 6, but not as good of a job as Rev1, The ending left me kind of unsatisfied, and the story in my opinion has very little chance to be played more than once, they took a cheap way out for the end of the game thet made me upset just to leave room for another REV, The gameplay seemed unfinished, But even though the enemies get stale and the gameplay is not great the story is not awful, they also may have won me over with some quotes and who does not like barry and claire?  They could have added some more story for Barry and Claire, And I think the game lost A LOT of its fun due to the fact it was eposodic, The walking dead, Game of thrones, Life is Strange, ect can get away with being eposodic, but RE is not an eposodic series, even more so considering what they could have done with the story but did not do, And it is one of those games you may just want to come home one day and play and beat in 2 days, so the episodes leave you feeling restricted if you did not wait for the full game, I would give it a 6 or 7 out of 10, Oh I also can run far cry 4 on high and I have a gaming computer, but this lagged in some areas on some low settings in some parts of the game, Is it worth $25? yeah sure. Is it worth $40? maybe not. But for 25 if your a fan of the series go ahead and pick it up.","March 19, 2015","true","17.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Once you complete the campaign you can do it agait to try get S rank in each mission, find all the hidden item (Tower symbol, Kafka and bug), do countdown mode, invisible mode or complete raid mode.\n\nThe only down side for resident evil Revalation 2 are so far technical and faulty advertising. Many of the technical as been resolve with the release of episode 4 so that part is clear. As the false advertising, be careful The game advertise an offline co-op that was not suppose to be there and back pedal to add it in. But so far can only be play with 2 gamepad.  Online coop for raid mode that was supose to be here with episode 4 is still missing and lastly the over 200 raid mode map are in reallity 145 map (48 map with 3 different difficulty and 1 unique map) and 157 map if you own the dlc.\n\nBottom line a game that is for you if your a fan of resident evil","March 20, 2015","true","48.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Been an RE fan since Zero, and Nemesis. Resident Evil: Revelations is by far, the best survival horror sub-franchise since RE: HD Remake - RE4.  Revelations 2 have got dynamic story, interesting LOCAL co-op splitscreen play, and no short of cheesy one liner dialogues from our favourite Barry. Set in the timeline between RE5 and RE6. There's even a raid mode for those of you who get thrilled with playing alongside another anonymous online, with hours of different maps from different RE games in the past. What's more to know is that capcom has been keeping the game constantly upto date EVEN AFTER the final release of Chapter 4 with FPS tweaks, co-op fixes and RE.Net, as another interesting concept for attaining special loot for your raid mode experience.

If Capcom has decided that light-horror, high-tension action is the firm and final direction for Resident Evil moving forward, Revelations 2 at least embraces that and provides a road map for where to take it next.","December 26, 2015","true","76.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's like the classic Resident Evils combined with the newer third person shooter ones: Epic Action & Frightening Horror, as well as an awesome storyline. Shortly after the time I wrote this review (Please bear with me here), I had 3 hours sleep last night, and I was completely tired, with it also being 1 AM where I was. At around that time, my blood was pumping with adrenaline as I was going through a hard & epic part of the game, and after I made it through, I laughed gloriously.\n\nI haven't known a game in years that has got me so hyped up at such early hours, with such little sleep. What a scary, intense and awesome game. Making a player scared but being awesome at the same time in an action survival horror is probably a very hard thing to do, and I give Capcom a round of applause.\n\nIn short: If you're into scary action survival games; Like you want to kick ♥♥♥ but have your ♥♥♥ kicked at the same time, this game is for you.","August 28, 2015","true","38.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even so, Biohazard Revelations 2 failed to fulfil any of my expectations.\n\nI thought it would be a long, jump scare filled horror with plenty of freedom to tackle horrifyingly difficult encounters in your own way.\n\nAs it turns out, BR2: Episode 1 is extremely short (see that play time? yeah, that short), only made me jump scare once (because I was about to sneeze), and is rather linear (though it was quite good at hiding the linearity), and the improvising was limited to -kill with bullets -kill with knife -kill with brick throw. Of course, the option to use bullets is there as long as you don\'t blanket fire, so the other options are pointless.\n\nOne thing that did surprise me, however, was the story. Much more interesting, character driven, creepy-thriller style story than I thought.\n\nAs a side note, I guess I am not in a position to complain about gore and language in a game like this.\n\nIn summary, extremely short, mediocre shooter, poor horror, good story.

The campaign lasted me a good 8+ hours and includes a lot of replay value in the form of different modes, difficulties and multiple endings. The gameplay is much tighter and focused than Resident Evil 6 and the game is paced better than the previous Revelations game. Even though the campaign is more than enough to warrant the $25 asking price, Capcom even threw in an extremely addictive and robust Raid mode that is jam packed full of missions, characters and RPG elements. Revelations 2 offers a ridiculous amount of gameplay for the budget price and feels more like a real Resident Evil title than RE6 does.

But this one RE revelations 2 is so amazing.. Nice atmosphere, finally normal enemies ( Zombies), great story and difficult. In first one revelations i died 3 times for whole game on hardest diff... Here i died already 5 times :) (Im playing it on Survival diff). It´s so cool for Cooperative. 1 guy plays as claire and shoting zombies, the second plays as her sister and with her flashlight you can find ammo for claire or open chests. I don´t recommend play it solo, because AI is terrible, usually stuck somewhere, of course you can play for both characters in solo, but sometimes happened i needed open the door, but i couldn´t to do it because my partner was stucked with zombies, so i had to switch and died.... Just want to say, AI is not good here. Just play it with friend. Here you can play finally Story in Coop. In first one revelations you could play only raid mode and it was really boring (Survival with progress)...About Graphic -ye it is good too, i dont complain. It looks good, sometimes i feel like I played Evil Within. But the worst is Optimization... I run it smooth on 60 FPS, but if i go to new room (location) it really hard lag for me (from 60 to 10 FPS) It´s Unplayable sometimes, even i change settings to low it drop FPS below 10 .....

It's been mentionned on a lot of gaming websites and on Capcom's site too so I don't get the complaints I read here. Didn't encounter any other problem or gamebreaking bugs during my time with the game but what's there can be fixed by a patch anyday so I wouldn't really worry about that.

Bugs and the whole co-op offline thing. Now after patching and all the episodes are out, the game is really one of the best in the Resident Evil Series. The controls are more like Resident Evil 6, but without the melee meter. The inventory system is MUCH better than RE6, and it's more like the earlier Resident Evil with limited bag space you can upgrade over time. The story while somewhat short (around 8 hours casual) has multiple ways to replay it in different modes and difficulties. The story itself is pretty good! Lots of twists and while it feels weird at first to have to switch between the two characters, you begin to realize their strengths and see the advantages of team work.\n\nRaid mode is where this game really shines though. The Raid mode is a ramped up version of Mercenaries from the earlier games. There are a large variety of enemies, including some enemies from previous titles. (Excutioner, i'm looking at you.) If you thought these enemies were bad before, now they get buffs, everything from invisibility, on fire, super speed, toxic gas to one that makes you die if you get too close and don't kill it within 30 seconds. Oh, and the buffs stack on the enemies when you get higher level. When you are fighting a Scagdead that can kill you in one hit that is invisible, on fire, and has super speed suddenly things get very tense. It's definitely challenging. A great thing about Raid mode is every character possesses certain skills that the other don't, for example, Cipher gets a katana to replace the knife. If you level up the Sword skill to max, you can pay again to unlock it for all other raid character to buy. Then that character can buy and use that skill. This is great because if you have a favorite character but they don't have the skills you want them to, now you can give them those skills. With the Dailies it's fairly easy to level up the characters to max out the skills you want.\n\nThe only negatives about this game really are the in game purchases for hearts and toolbox space. Hearts you earn by doing the daily missions which are easy enough if you are accustomed to raid mode. The Hearts are what you use to revive during Raid mode matches. Your partner cannot get you back up in Co-op. You won't really use them until you get to around level 100, that's when they game gets really crazy and very hard. It might take you a while to build back up your hearts so you can do more high level stuff unless you want to pay for them. Toolbox space you don't really need unless you are a pack rat because you can combine the parts.\n\nAll in all, this story reminds me more of Resident Evil 2, with the parallel storylines in the same areas but offset by time, with all the options and gameplay of the newer Resident Evil titles. That's a combo I like very much.","April 26, 2015","true","80.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Possibly means this game will have almost 8 hours of Campaign gameplay.\n-Very extensive and enjoyable Raid Mode. Tons of levels and 3 difficulties for each level.\n-Raid mode is not grind focused, so far, as of getting my first character to level 20. As you play through each stage at each difficulty, you should get enough XP to level up and keep going without replaying levels over and over.\n-Improved dodge system.\n-Improved skills system (and there are some really sweet skills. HUNK gets active camo).\n-Great music in Raid Mode, really sets the mood well.\n-Less frustrating Raid Mode overall. Completion Medal (Trinity Bonus in Rev 1) is much easier to get.\n-Split screen coop has been fully integrated into the pc version!\n\nCons:\n-Campaign AI partner is sadly stupid sometimes. I've watched Moira walk up to an enemy, take a hammer to the face, and walk right back to the same spot once she got up.\n-Many players are experiencing a horrific frame stutter. This happens mostly at random, and can mess up your dodging, shooting, or just doing anything in general.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI've been playing this game for 82 hours as of this edit, and I do still recommend this game. Previously I recommended getting it on the console if possible (to avoid framerate issue and for the lack of split-screen coop before) but now I'd definitely recommend this on PC. The framrate issue has been improved, yet it's still a problem. Split-screen coop is now a full feature in the game. The MAIN reason I recommend this game on PC is that there are numerous characters in raid mode, but some of their character models use the latest versions that I don't care for (I won't name them to avoid spoilers). With mods I'm able to enjoy these characters in their best forms, as well as remove that awful film grain from the screen. So if you want a good Resident Evil experience at a reasonable cost, I really recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyCanuck84/recommended/287290/","CrazyCanuck84","CrazyCanuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyCanuck84/","859 products in account","OverviewWhatever your opinion of this whole PC same-screen co-op “scandal”, as some people say, the game itself is still fun to play. It’s Resident Evil, and comes with all the quirks and issues that have plagued the other titles, but is still a fun game to play.\n\nStory/AtmosphereAs only one episode has been released, the story is still somewhat unknown. The events of episode one take place many years after those of the original game. You begin as Claire, waking up in a prison cell, with no clue as to where you are or how you got there. You soon meet up with Moira, Barry’s daughter, and adventure together. You do eventually leave the prison itself, only to discover where you are.\n\nThe second part of episode one has you playing as Barry, who received a distress call from Moira, and has come to the prison to investigate (how he tracked the location down we’ll either find out later, or may never know). He meets a young girl named Natalie, who winds up accompanying him in his search, because why not take a little girl into a monster infested location while you search for your daughter who sent out a distress call from a monster infested location.\n\nThe story isn’t too convoluted, yet, but that will surely change. Capcom is known for throwing twists and turns at every corner.\nOnce you find out where you are, you’ll come to appreciate the location. Capcom has done a great job rendering the prison and its surroundings, and you’ll get to see many parts of it, from both Claire and Barry’s perspective.\n\nGameplayGameplay is almost similar to the Outbreak games, where you control multiple people. As Claire, you’ll be accompanied by Moria, who holds a flashlight while you hold the gun. Why Claire is incapable of holding both a gun and a flashlight I don’t know, but that would throw off the whole mechanics of the game, I guess. After a certain point, you can freely switch between both characters, and you will need to do that for certain parts of the story. Moira can also find collectibles, or ammo, or other items by seeing a glint, then shining the light at the glint to make it interactive, allowing her (or Claire) to pick it up. If the AI is controlling Moira, you can’t do this.\n\nThe same goes for Barry and Natalie. Natalie can crawl through small spaces to open the way for Barry, while also being able to point at glinting objects (literally, you point), which allows her or Barry to then pick up that object.\n\nLike the first Revelations, you can dodge enemy attacks, but the dodge seems far superior and actually works, compared to the first game. You have the quick turn (180), and can walk while firing.\n\nGraphicsThe game looks good. Characters are well detailed, except for their faces. Claire quite often looks like she’s constipated. Environments are dark, disturbing, moody, dank, etc. I find the enemy models to be terrific.\n\nThe environment is done well, too. Trees cast an eerie glow from the sky, bushes and leaves rustle. Is it your AI partner running through that bush, or something else?\n\nThere isn’t a lot of graphical options to set in-game, and are pretty much standard fare.\n\nAnd while the game does look good, it doesn’t look fantastic. But, such is life when it comes to what is essentially a straight port. Resident Evil games have always been developed with a console first attitude, and that’s fine. But Capcom is especially lazy and/or incompetent when it comes to porting games. Resident Evil HD Remaster is the exception to this rule, and is actually a very well done port.\n\nSound/MusicThe music, as usual for Resident Evil games, is great. If you pre-ordered it, you get some soundtrack selections. My game only has four music files, but I don’t know if more will be released with each episode, or if that is the extent of it.\n\nSound effects are great, and really lead to some tense moments. The acting, while passable, is like all Resident Evil games, and occasionally sounds forced while always sounding cheesy. The characters even poke fun at certain things, such as Claire exclaiming how she didn’t become a Claire sandwich, and Barry making fun of his master of unlocking comment from 1996.\n\nPerformanceAnd this is where Resident Evil Revelations 2 falters. The performance is spotty. Often times, when readying your gun to aim, there’s some slight lag as the game zooms in to your character’s head. There are lots of moments where the framerate stutters for no apparent reason. It’s a completely unoptimized product. Which is also evident when the game tells you not to turn off your console while its saving. Yes, the PC version tells you not to shut off your CONSOLE. If that isn’t incompetent “optimizing”, I don’t know what is.\n\nI didn’t experience any crashes or startup issues.\n\nMultiplayer InfoSo this is what’s causing an uproar by a lot of fans. The PC version of Revelations 2 is the only version not to have local, offline co-op. Not that it’ll be patched in later, but it just doesn’t have it to begin with. I don’t get the big deal myself, but I can understand how people feel deceived by Capcom, as this information was not originally in the game description, so people who pre-ordered or bought it thinking they’d be able to play locally with a friend are annoyed, and for good reason.\n\nOnline co-op for Raid mode (not the campaign) is to come in a later patch. If I remember, I’ll update my review accordingly whenever that happens.\n\nEverything ElseThe game is short. I completed both acts of the first episode in about three hours. Let’s assume each episode is about that time, you’re looking at twelve hours of a story once all episodes are out (four episodes at three hours each). It’s not horrible that it’s short, and it’s not a full priced game either, so value for money is pretty on par.\n\nRaid mode, while fun, is somewhat boring at the moment, as you’re limited to playing yourself. Once co-op is patched in, I’m sure it’ll get better.\n\nSummaryDon't judge the game based on Capcom's multiplayer issue. Judge the game on what it is; a game. Don't give it a bad review because you're ticked off with them, give it a bad review if it's actually a bad game.\n\nIt’s Resident Evil, and you either love or hate them. I, personally, have hated the fact that the games have taken an action-heavy stance, and I loved the slow and methodical pace of the first three games. However, it’s still a fun title, with what little time you’ll need to invest into it. And the story is always worth seeing.\n\nAlso, Barry. Barry is back.","February 26, 2015","true","15.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Frame rate is an issue but you may want to turn off your steam overlay for the game before you blame capcom. It isn't the best port but I paid 24.99usd and the campaign is playable. Co-op for raid mode comes out in march and raid mode alone is worth the money I payed for it. The story really leaves you longing for the next episode which is brilliant on Capcom's part. Much better than RER1. Go buy a console if you have a problem with the pc version and it wasn't false advertising that they don't have co-op. Check the Steam page for RER2 and it says Single-player.\n\nBest parts of this game:\n...Use Moira Burton flash light Like Alan Wake to stun then switch to Claire and Enjoy Destruction.\n...Campaign play through saves your ammo even if you switch to a harder difficulty.\n...Skill sets allow you to upgrade characters in Campaign with BP.\n...Barry Burton as usual is a bad Mother... Shut yo Mouth.\n...Reminds me of Code Veronica.\n...CGI Cinematics make the game look good. Graphics all around are excellent.\n...Medal System for Campaign is challenging and fun.\n...Moira Burton is a little bad mouth girl with daddy issues that needs a Spanking!!! :D\n...Raid Mode is Fantastic!!!\n\nWorst Parts:\n...Dang Frame rate seizure.\n...No head explosion when you get a head shot. (Really?) You gotta fix that asap Capcom!\n...You can't use Gold from Raid mode to buy BP but you can use BP from Campaign to Buy Raid Mode Gold(LAME!!!)\nCapcom needs to add that into the game on all supported consoles in my opinion.\n...The AI is really stupid. You switch characters and they don't defend them selves when left alone.\n\nThat's it. The game works for me and I hope it does for you because it's fun.

Yeah, they made a decent game, but Raid Mode... Raid Mode really shines here. When I finished Raid Mode of the first Revelations, I was hoping they will some day release a better, deeper version of it in some of their upcoming games. With separate character levelling, skill variation you can control, and stuff. And guess what? They delivered. This new Raid Mode is everything I've ever hoped it to become and MORE. They even built stages specificly for it, not just took parts of the campaign and slapped some monsters over it. Also, you'll gonna meet some friends from first Revelations and (to my biggest surprise) a guest from far away Resident Evil 5!

The only thing that bugs me is the episodic release.  I want to finish the story, especially with the weird reveal at the end.  To each their own but as a fan of the series I feel this is a good addition.","February 26, 2015","true","16.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I'm hoping they rectify this issue for those who bought the game solely for this. But....\n\nI wasn't planning on trying any sort of coop with this game so luckily I wasn't affected.  Res Evil has always been a single player experience for me, and to that end I found the first chapter of this iteration to be a lot of fun.  It keeps the structure of the first Revelations intact, but adds something new into the mix with a light crafting feature and an AI partner that is actually somewhat helpful.  If you've played any RE since the fourth one, you're fairly familiar with the gameplay from the start; and I'm glad to say it's just as tight a third person shooter you could ask for.  There are bits of exploration and action which are fed to the player at a good pace.  It's not quite the backtrack-fest of the earlier RE's, but it's also not the Michael Bay-fest of the 6th game.  It's a good balance and I appreciate the thought put into both the creepy atmosphere and the enemy encounters.  That said, the setting is a little ho hum so far (act 1), and I'm hoping to see some diverse environments as it continues.  Also of note is the performance - I had some stuttering issues, but when setting the framerate limit to 60fps this dropped dramatically, though not completely.  So I am hoping for a patch to address this.  Lastly I'd like to bring up Barry's daughter.  We're supposed to like her, and hope for her well being through Barry's sections; but she's far from agreeable.  With all her f-bombs and angsty complaining, I kind of wish Claire would accidentally shoot her - I've tried believe me!\n\nAll in all, a good start to what I'm hoping is a great game.  I give it a hesitant recommendation only because of it's performance issues.","February 26, 2015","true","17.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Very immersive (use quality headphones !) and good story. The Raid mode is a really nice addition to the game, where you grind XP for levels, guns, abilities, etc it was pretty cool in Revelations 1 but I think it's 10 times better in Revelations 2, really well done.","February 26, 2015","true","24.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

Puzzle wise, RE relevations 2 is alot more simple than previous installations, more puzzle solving and claustrophobic enviroment is the way to go . There is a good mix of action and horror segements, not overwhelming like RE6. Swtiching between characters in game is pretty smooth. Good job on the music. As this the initial release, bugs are expected, I'll forgive you. Lastly, maybe the episodic release is too harsh ....... or the wait for 1 week per episode is too long.\n\nEpisode 1, What I liked:\n\n1) Enviroment\n2) Neat UI\n3) Smooth character switch\n4) RAID mode\n5) Good mix of action and horror\n\nWhat's bad:\n\n1) Frame issues\n2) Episode ........\n3) Insufficient puzzle solving\n4) No local Co-op\n\nScore 7.5/10\n\n\nEdit\n\nEpisode 2\n\nFixed frame issues !! yeah~  The environment/atmosphere is creepy as ever, game play is intensive. I got freaked out once while sneaking around a low wall and a Revenant just suddenly stick its head in your face and growl.... The story narration through Barry's and Clarie's campaign is nice and well paced. We finally got to meet the story's main antagonist (maybe) and of course, the encounter ended with another cliffhanger for Episode 3.  Episode 2 contains some nice intense boss fights that are not draggy like RE6. Really nice and I am looking forward to episode 3.\n\nSome bugs though (Contains spoliers)\n\n1) Natalia sometimes would not warn or point at the invisible fly\n2) Zombies sometimes will stuck around corners","February 26, 2015","true","30.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

ZERO FPS drops. ZERO freezing. People complaining about it either; a) have an old PC. b) have a good PC but a lot of ♥♥♥♥ on it that makes it slower i.e programs open/processes. or c) just complain because they can. Either way I had a very enjoyable time with it.\n\n- I had just tried it on my Laptop today which has a gtx 780m, 8gb of corsair ram and an i7 4790Q, worked great and locked at 70fps sometimes dipped to 60 - 65 but literally no freezing or lock ups what so ever.\n\nAnyways, do I recommend it? Yes, but only for people who like/love Resident Evil. I've been playing the series and loving it since number 4, went back and finished all the other ones and loved those and even went on to 5 and 6 which weren't THAT bad (although Chris punching a boulder is a bit over the top), however the fact that this is an "Episodic Series" is a poor choice for Capcom. I have no idea why they decided to do this, I do mind it and I don't at the same time, having to wait only a week for each episode to come out is nice, but waiting in general is kind of poor. I do like how you can pay $6 and try the game's first episode to see if you like it and it also makes me want to search around in the first episode more and more to see if I have missed anything, but yet again, episodic form just literally does not suit it.\n\nONTO THE GAMEPLAY/GRAPHICS.\n\nGameplay is fun, they kept the same atmosphere from RE: Revelations 1 (i.e kind of like RE4) which is great, makes it feel all the more terrifying while at the same time fun while trying to fight for my life or looking away at a point where I suspect a jump scare is coming which all the points I suspect one is coming.. it does not, except for the first one.\n\nGraphics, what can I really say? Looks really good, recently upgraded to a 980 and 32gb of ram so I could run the game no problem, Claire looks great and the effects look amazing, however I felt like the blood at the start of the episode was a little too bright, other than that though the game looked really nice and some scenes were reminiscent of the old RE games, cliche but scary at the same time.\n\nSTORY\n\nStory seems alright for now, still need to see the other episodes/full game before commenting on it but so far it seems like it has a pretty decent story in terms of "Resident Evil", good atmosphere, old characters etc. If you want to know more about the story you should look it up, not posting any spoilers here.\n\nOVERALL\n\nI think the game is a lot of fun and worth the $6 for the first episode at least, you can see if you can play it, how well it runs and most importantly if you like it or not, after all $6 isn't very much, chump change as they say.\n\nFor now, I'd give it a 7.8 out of 10 for the first Episode at least, not the greatest but not the worst either.\n\nFOR MORE REVIEWS STAY TUNED TO IGN huehue 7.8/10 too much water?","February 25, 2015","true","11.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","2"

So far Revelations 2 is a massive disappointment. A masterclass in poor dialog, questionable game design,  and mediocre storytelling\n\nEdit: Alright so having finished all four episodes now, I can safely say I wouldn't recommend this game. A lot of people have been hailing this as a return to for for Resident Evil...as the best title since 4. I....do not see that at all. While not as action heavy as 5 and 6, it still is a far cry from the "heavy on the atmosphere and tension" days of old.\n\n-As I mention above, this game has some really terrible dialog. Some have defended it, saying that the series has always had terrible writing, which I still say is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t claim. While the dialog in the series has never been award winning by any means, the only game to truely have god awful dialog was the very first Resident Evil. 20 years ago. Even then, characters weren't acting like they were straight out of Lethal Weapon, Die Hard or some other ish. They constantly (and I do mean constantly) crack wise about their circumstances, spouting horrible one liners and psuedo-badass quips every few feet. This might not have been THAT bad if the story didn't try to make you take it seriously. They'll act one way in in cutscenes, then in-game act the complete opposite. I feel there's no real consistency to any of them. There's one point where one particular character receives what should be devastating news, soul crushing stuff and they don't even really react accordingly. Hell, not even two minutes later they're back to yelling B-movie action hero lines. It doesn't mesh at all.\n\n-As for the story....It rips so much from Code Veronica yet still ends up being nowhere near as interesting. Characters are half baked (if even that much), the antagonist is boring compared to the Ashfords (really compared to almost anything), and the 'twist' in the final episode seems to set up yet another horrific story failure in later installments.\n\n-Enemy design I found to be really bland, save for the final boss, who looked truly disturbing.\n\n-Environments too felt bland. Nothing stood out at all. Well, nothing outside of the overwhelming amounts of brown and grey\n\nSo uh...yeah that's it. Another bad Resident Evil.

Up until now i`ve only exerienced them on Raid mode and only for 10 or so seconds on the start. Or in really effect loaded stages like with snowstorm effects and co.\nJust pause the game at level start and wait some seconds( 10 sec. should do ). Then continue playing. This should solve the lagging ( it works for me). I am sure CAPCOM will solve this soon enough, be patient.\n\n!!And hell yes this IS a great game!!\n\nFor me as an old RE fan with playing every part avaliable i would say this can turn out to be one of the best RE stories we have had so far. Very tense moments at some points.\n\nThe game itself presents again as more of a shooter then the old scool survival we know and love.\nNot much of puzzles or Item searching. You progress most of the game straightly linear. Engage in fights and action like the known RE4-6 parts.\nNew is that you always have to keep an eye on your AI controlled partner and sometimes you even need him for some of the puzzles. (Reminds me of RE Zero)\n\nItem and resource management is vital so far, even more on the harder dificulties.\n\nAlot of Content has been added. Lots of Weapons and Skills for Raid Mode ( Plays like a shooter with RPG elements)\n\nIngame there is even more challenges and achievements and this contet is getting bigger with every episode.\n\nSo if you can overlook tis "buh bad" lagging problem that some people experience and makes them stop playing because the game is not perfect from the start... ((( what a shame - seriously people. The game was just launched and you expected no bugs???))) ...i am sure you can enjoy a very good game that will get even better from episode to episode.\n","March 7, 2015","true","172.0"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

If you want to know whether the game is worth it, the entry price to find out is miniscule. I'd recommend doing that if you are on the fence and decide for yourself rather than take the word of me or other people.\n\nOne thing of note is that I have heard people with mid-decent spec computers have had some performance issues, I'm running a 970 and mostly stay at 120 frames per second, there are about three bits in the game though where it appears like performance tanks, but the framerate still is reported at about 60, I think it's a bug more than it is poor optimisation, but if this bothers you I would wait for it to be fixed.\n\nAnd for those wondering, I was worried that the mouse controls would be bad, that there would be mouse acceleration or negative mouse acceleration, but if there was I didn't really notice it, and I'm pretty autistic about stuff like that, so if that was a worry for you then you shouldn't be worried.","February 25, 2015","true","57.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Gone is the oversaturation of QuickTimeEvents from RE6. This game brings back the spooky and horror atmosphere of the previous games  (RE 1- 4), and mixes the control system from RE Revelations 1 to great effect.\n\nDuring the campaign mode, you have 2 characters to control but at the same time, it provides a completely different gameplay perspective from the Co-op/partner system in RE5 (which kind of removed the sense of the danger from the game). In RE Rev 2, the partner system actually adds a sense of tension and stress to the game.The game cleverly (sometimes not) builds its puzzles around the duo system (think of Sherry and Claire from RE2). Some of the puzzles actually bring back memories of the puzzles from the classic RE (especially RE1).\n\nMoreover, if you like shooting zombies and like grinding for gears, there is Raid Mode. It is like a mini-RPG Shoot-Em-Up game. If you played RE-Revelations 1, you know what to expect here.\n\nMy only complaint, if there were any, would be a very minor one. I, at first, kind of did not like what they did with the character 3d faces, but then, you do get used to it after a while.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is highly recommeded for any Resident Evil fans.","March 11, 2015","true","126.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

(Review Written After Episode 3 Release)\n\nPros:Returns to Classic Horror\nSynergy among pairings (Moira/Claire and Natalia/Barry) are solid\nEpisodic Releases allow for digestion of storyline and encourages replay value\nSimilar to Resident Evil 2 and 3 Scenarios where actions of Moira/Claire affects Natalia/Barry\nRaid Mode is Improved and Interesting\nGina dancing to Kill Zombies!Cons:Frame Rate still choppy, especially when starting a new mission or after unpausing game\nLocal and Online Co-Op still yet to be released\nEpisodes 1 and 2 are relatively short compared to Episode 3\n♥♥♥♥ those invisible bugs!Detailed Review:\nMost players seem to be up in arms for the Co-Op mode which is indeed the fault of Capcom and subsidiaries; however, ignoring that part of the release, this game is one of the best releases that the Resident Evil series has published in recent years. The game follows an episodic journey that, as previously mentioned, encourages replay value and dissects the story in a way that has you wanting more in a good way.\n\nWhat truly makes Revelations 2 shine is both the pairings and departure of atmosphere from Resident Evil 5 and 6, the former was a favorite due to doing Co-Op with a friend. Claire and Moira make a good combo together as they both have a solid partnership in taking out enemies with a combination of light and firepower to help stem the flow of enemies. Their scenario also have many more intricate boss fights that require you to utilize terrain and pseudo-stealh to overcome.\n\nOn the other hand, Natalia and Barry also work well together as the perceptive abilities of Natalia allows for an even greater stealth option that has been mission in previous Resident Evil games. Their scenario gives light to new options that allows for Barry to either sneak past or eliminate his foes quietly. Furthermore, the actions performed in the previous scenario allows for different enemies and options to appear, which becomes more apparent in later episodes. (I did not open a gate in Episode 3 which means I could not get Barry his new Rifle.)\n\nThe game also makes use of character skill sets that helps create scenarios where you have to constantly switch back and forth between characters to bypass blockades and traps. These options give light to the Resident Evil wishes we have wanted in the latter years of the series where puzzles, atmosphere, and improvements to gameplay come together and create a solid experience for the player.\n\nAlthough I have not spent as much time to give a fully cohesive report on Raid Mode, what I have witnessed so far is quite enjoyable. It's an improvement over Revelations 1 and gives players the opportunity to play their favorites in an actual storyline Raid Mode. You can also have characters inherit anothers skills to create the perfect players for your style.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nThis game is indeed a treat for fans of the series, regardless of the Co-Op incident. The game returns to its roots and is one of the best the series has had so far. It's storyline is more than delightful; Raid Mode is a blast and addictive; and the gameplay is solid.","March 11, 2015","true","18.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I do struggle with some stutters and fps drops every now and then for no reason but it's worth a shot picking out the first episode and trying it out. It has a lot of replay value and I can't wait for all episodes to be out. They are also listening about the request for co-op and it has been put in the works which is great.

This review primarily focuses on comparing RER1 and RER2.\n\nRER2 got off to a somewhat rocky and "meh" start with the first episode but EP2 and EP3 are significantly better.\n\nPros:\n+The game mechanics are improved from RER1 and they've maintained the fun stuff from RER1 while adding cool and interesting new stuff like the skill trees. The partner mechanics are fun and allow for plenty of on-the-fly switching during combat for strategy.\n\n+Claire and Barry are back! This might seem like not a big deal but if you are a longtime RE fan it's nice to see them back, and they are handled perfectly.\n\n+Good soundtrack. Not amazing but it is atmospheric and gets the job done.\n\n+Good replay value for collectibles and medals-- chapters are short, and they're easy to quickly replay to go back and get extras.\n\n+Raid Mode is more fleshed out and is a full-fledged gameplay mode this time, as opposed to it being an afterthought in RER1.\n\n\nCons:\n-The story has gotten better with EP2-3 but it's really hard to believe they're going to tie all of this up nicely in EP4.\n\n-Difficulty is a bit average. Especially if you run chapters again to get extras, you will end up with massive stocks of ammo and tons of BP to spend on skill trees, which kind of trivializes the need to bother managing ammo. If you're looking for a challenge, I recommend you play the game straight through once, and don't replay episodes until you've finished the game.\n\n-No online campaign co-op. This was "acceptable" in RER1 since it was a port of a 3DS game but it just feels like a silly omission here.\n\n-As of this writing there are still some stuttering/freezing issues. I've only ever had the game totally freeze on me once, but the stuttering issues are frequent and irritating. They seem to be working on this so hopefully it will be fully fixed.","March 7, 2015","true","49.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The only thing that is kinda upsetting is the episodic releasing, feels weird in a game like Resident Evil, However the story is good enough to justify the wait. It builds suspence and excitement for the next episode to release, It feels more like waiting for a great tv show then just the next chapter of a game.\n\nAlso Raid mode is very fun, and gives you more hours of gameplay for the price.","March 6, 2015","true","39.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

What kind of company sells a game based on its co-op features, promises offline co-op in the store description, and then doesn't deliver ANY kind of co-op on launch?\n\nThis is a complete waste of money. Feature-wise, the game seems like it might be good in co-op. There are a few nice little touches that encourage co-operative play. Moira doesn't use guns, but can aim the flashlight and finish off enemies for Claire, effectively turning the RE4 staple of the good old 1-2 Shoot'n'melee combo into a co-op action, which is a great idea. The sound design and atmosphere are top-notch, and the enemies genuinely feel slightly threatening. In co-op, this game might be quite a lot of fun, what completely kill it is the partner AI.\n\nThe AI is a complete handicap; moira would frequently be unable to follow me, she would fail to finish off enemies I had shot, she refused to use her crowbar at all even when I was on the brink of death, and she would only occasionally use the flashlight, usually in well-lit areas, the dark areas being left unlit by her shy torch.\n\nIn its current state, the game feels like playing a splitscreen game in co-op by yourself and occasionally dropping one controller to play with the other. It's a shame because the dialogue is a decent peg above standard Resident Evil fare, and the plot is genuinely interesting for once with a wonderfully fresh SAW-esque vibe to it. You know a series is stagnating when borrowing from SAW makes it feel fresh.\n\nDo NOT waste your money in this game until co-op is patched in. Although knowing Capcom, they're probably lying about that too.","February 25, 2015","false","20.6"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","0"

It's fun, well paced and deep. Shame is its offline mode only for now and it gets lots(but unnecessery)DLC trying to dry your wallet.

Campaign just as ridiculous as graphics, srsly,developers give no explanation whatsoever and they don't even try to connect first revelations with uh this "game". Controls are amazing - try to run and turn  your mouse simultaneously and you will get exiting dizzy feeling in your stomach. After so - called first season ( which was basically th same map run over twice) game showed me credits, which you cannot even skip and which made me furious, because people who made this game are just a bunch of incompetent developers. Okay, maybe there is something more interesting in the raid mode - I said to myself and this was a grave mistake. If you have ever played RE2 or RE3, you expect something better than some very strange music from 90-s. And the last point - this game is about evil russians, spooky as hell, right?\nP.S - there is a donate system in-game.\nMy recommendation - You should play  revelations 1 or Alan Wake, this thing is not worth a penny.\nUPD - lol,  I just found out that they used locations from RE6 for Raid mode, this is just sad.\nUPD 2 - I have made through second season and should I say that it was glorius adventure with interesting bossbattles and plot twists? No, I should not.\nBosses were lame and boring - first one even do not have any name or identity or why he looks different than other zombies. What is more important - level design is so bad that it looks like as if you are walking the whole season around big low-poligonized dump, without any logic , without any feeling that  you are walking around ghost town - srsly developers could have added a little bit of Racoon city's atmosphere of decay and horror.\nAlso, thanks to unscipable credits, I have discovered that developers had so-called quality assurance - group of testers, I would highly reccomend to fire that team - they have done nothing, literally. For example - developers should make a patch that will translate those weird japanese symbols in the beginning, or at least give me an opportunity to stop credits (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s).\nBTW - guys, it seems you speak a lot about co-op, but do you really want to drag into this ♥♥♥♥ your friends?","February 27, 2015","false","12.2"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","2"

Story is typical Resident Evil fare, but the gameplay is solid. They rolled back some of the movement features from RE 6 thankfully (like the roll dodging and accessing your inventory via a clumsy interface through a phone or something) and have kept the meat of the 3rd person shooter mechanics. This with the RPG elements similar to Mass Effect 3 or other short wave based rounds with leveling up equate to solid and quick fun of gunning zombies down with either defense mode or point A to B (sometimes with and without a timer).

First the objective stuff, then the personal complains:\n\n[OBJECTIVE] = First off, the main story mode is basically unplayable.  The game lags constantly, often just straight-up freezing when there are more than two people on screen (which, since you are always with an AI companion, is anytime there is a single enemy on screen).  I have fiddled with the settings more than I care to discuss, and nothing works.  Looking online, some people suggest locking the fps, others suggest unlocking it, some suggest turning v-sync off, some suggest turning it on; basically, no one has any idea how to fix this mess.  I’m not going to go into a long, detailed description of my specs, but suffice it to say that I can run games with much larger environments, more effects, better graphics, and better, well, EVERYTHING without any issues.  I was able to get raid mode to work, but even then it jittered here and there.\n\nAlso, the camera is “sticky”; when you move the camera while aiming it lags for a second (just the reticule, not the whole game) and then zips up to its proper speed.  As I’m sure you can imagine, this makes getting head shots, or, rather, ANY type of shot very difficult and frustrating.\n\nBased on all the other reviews, I know I am not the only one having these issues.  I would not recommend getting this game until people start to say that they are fixed.\n\n[PERSONAL] = There are just so many design choices that make no sense.  First of all, why are custom parts locked to guns in raid mode?  Half the fun in RE Revelations was experimenting to see what was optimal.  Who cares if there are tons more custom parts now; no one is going to risk wasting time and money on a new, totally-strange gun load out if you have to destroy the gun to get the parts back or destroy the parts to get the gun back.  It’s supposed to make you really consider whether you want to put parts onto a gun, but everyone is just going to go with the tried-and-true parts like increased damage or increased magazine size and then destroy the gun to roll those parts over to a new gun of the same type when they get one.\n\nAnd then there is Moira Burton, the workshopped-to-death punk girl wannabe who is constantly freaking out about all the blood and gore and violence around her.  Now, yes, it is reasonable that a girl of her age and background would act this way but that does not make it any less annoying.  This is RESIDENT EVIL; blood and gore are as common as bad dialog here.\n\nShe also has this weird thing with guns in that she won’t use them or even acknowledge them, really.  When you get your first gun, right after the two of you were nearly killed by an enemy (who then went on to brutally murder another girl in front of you two, more on her in a second) she asks, “are you going to use that?”  No, Moira, I’m going to stick it in my butt so I can play Russian roulette every time I sit down.\n\nYes, yes, her aversion to guns is supposed to allude to some tragic event in her past but WE ARE IN A SURVIVAL SITUATION, MOIRA.  It's bad enough that I have to switch to you to find hidden items and kill stunned enemies, but can you at least harden up and stop talking to me?\n\nLast, and certainly not least in my list of petty complaints: do you remembers Rachel Foley, the super-hot blonde combat specialist from RE Revelations?  Did you like having her in raid mode?  You did?  Well, good news!  RE Revelations 2 has her ugly, brown-haired, glasses-wearing, office-nerd sister!  Isn’t that just GREAT?!\n\nNow, I would like to note that I am posting this on Feb. 25th, the day of release of the first episode on steam.  Once all of the episodic content is out the lag issues, stickiness issues, and the lack of Rachel Foley might be fixed (since they are releasing more raid mode characters with each episode); if they are then please disregard those complaints.\n\nThat being said, Capcom still chose to release this game with all of the lag and stickiness.  It just goes to show why you should never, ever pre-order a game even if it is from a company you respect and trust.  I don’t think this will be my last Capcom game, but it will certainly be the last game that I ever pre-order.\n\nTL;DR = Lots of potential, but bogged down by horrible lag.  Wait until all of the episodes are out and then see what people are saying about how it runs.\n","February 25, 2015","false","46.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","0"

Well while it's still no surival horror ( sadly ) I don't look at this game as one, nor do I plan to sway my opinon because it's different from its roots.\n1 Urobros monsters actually look like they should and are pretty hard to kill ( unlike RE5 where they where just africans..)\n2 It doesn't have the best voice acting but in a way it reminded me of classic Resident evils.\n3 I love merc mode, and this game re-did it in a new way that's legit awesome as hell, I love it and i can gladly poor more than 100 hours in it alone, like I use to do on the other resident evil's and possible more than I have in the old.\n4 It didn't leave much feeling with the people who come in and out of the story to be honest, but some of the end results left me the feels, good or bad.\n5 Classic RE bosses where hard. This resident evil has some really stupid hard bosses that work legit JUST LIKE classic bosses in RE 1 and 2 / 3 and that made me extremely happy to see, ( considering the stupid freaking bosses from RE5 and 6, " look at me I'm some giant worm on a boat lul shoot me wif stuff " non of that BS )\n6 I did have some parts where I was feeling a bit scared which I haven't felt in RE since maybe the classics, and I love scary games and it takes a lot to scare me ( look at my Pro pic, freaking loved Silent Hill 3 )\n7 Gameplay is fun to me, even with the big change in RE 4 with a 3rd person type thing going on, I like how it played and yes you can aim and walk.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~FINAL VERDICT ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIf you're looking for a new RE game that feels like the old, this is as close as you will get, story wise; and little things like the boss fights and the pretty bad voice acting, leaves you with a feeling of RE1/2/3\nIf you like the way RE 6 / 5 / 4 was gameplay wise you'll like this one.\nIf you're like me and freaking of Merc mode, buy this game now and have tons of fun.\nGreat Game > Bad Game,\nDon't come into this game thinking it will be RE 1/2/3 those games will sadly NEVER make it now in game companies for some STUPID reason. Look at this as some fun, and how RE is suppose to be with the game play of newer games.","September 27, 2015","true","64.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Story is typical Resident Evil fare, but the gameplay is solid. They rolled back some of the movement features from RE 6 thankfully (like the roll dodging and accessing your inventory via a clumsy interface through a phone or something) and have kept the meat of the 3rd person shooter mechanics. This with the RPG elements similar to Mass Effect 3 or other short wave based rounds with leveling up equate to solid and quick fun of gunning zombies down with either defense mode or point A to B (sometimes with and without a timer).

It's poorly optimized to the extent that I doubt the "minimum requirements" are truly enough to run it, and the coop doesn't work. HOWEVER, as a game, RER2 is everything I wanted it to be. Hell, it's everything I wanted Resident Evil 5 & 6 to be; genuinely atmospheric in single-player, with companions that don't waste ammo by default and who won't need you to save them every ten seconds. I've yet to encounter any QTE sections, and as I only play keyboard this is a huge plus. I even like that you can switch between your useful (carries gun) and not-so useful (uses melee weapon/carries flashlight/fits in tight spaces) characters at will, and that anyone who plays single-player is forced to do so if you want to find half the ammo in a level. For the first time in a Resident Evil game I found myself genuinely desperate for more bullets, and it's actually kinda fun (anyone who struggled to keep enough ammo in RE4 may have less fun).\n\nRaid mode, the thing you do after you beat story mode, has been giving some people problems. However, aside from the occasional frame drop, I've found Raid mode to be a highly playable variation on the hoard mode formula. You'll encounter specialized/modified monsters, unlock weapons, and earn cash and experience to put toward a character upgrade system (there's a similar skill system in single-player, but there doesn't seem to be any overlap between the two).\n\nRAID MODE FEATURES MICROTRANSACTIONS, but the things you can buy appear to be mostly meaningless: gems that allow you to continue a Raid mission without losing any found items or progress, and extra guns and parts. RAID MODE LOCKS ELEMENTS OF GUN/UPGRADE STORAGE AS DLC, which is sad, but you are free to sell any weapons/upgrades you don't want/need.\n\nDoes releasing a bad port and sticking in microtransactions make Capcom a huge corporate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? Yes. Do I regret my purchase? Not at all.\n\nBuy if you like Resident Evil.","February 27, 2015","true","9.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

It won't match other horror games today, however it takes good ideas from other places.  Much better than Revelations 1 and that was already an improvement for pacing.\n-Better FOV than Resident Evil 6: The last triple A title was chock full of ways to try to get us to feel claustrophobic and even had an option to change which shoulder the player was looking at.  With a much more comfortable FOV in this game, you're stuck with 'over the right should' view and that's not only classic RE 4, but also good enough when paired with proper FOV.\n-Good length: about 10 hours taking my time.  None of this 4 different campaigns with a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in between.\n-Laser pointer vs. crosshairs: the option exists!  However it is located in a bad spot on the menu (more on that later.)\n-Good forced single-player co-op: For once the series has struck a good balance between the constant escort mission and co-op AI.  With the ability to switch between the two pairs of characters (Claire and Moira—Barry and Natalia) the switch is not only available, but necessary.  One player is always the power character that can get the damage dealt and the other forms the new role of pointman/strategic distraction.  The secondary characters actually have important roles to the story and gameplay and are actually fun to use if used correctly.  They have to be used to get all the items in the game.\n-Great child character that doesn't need you to hold her hand on everything, gun use excluded: Natalia is a fearless little girl that manages to not be whiny, annoying, or hopelessly mired in little girl inane chatter.  She is dead useful in gameplay, and when used right will be your designated pointman instead of the power character Barry.   A character that straddles the line between escort mission/and useful skills.\n-Story: The story was a good one and very Resident Evil with viruses, villains, and even some zombies! All I cared was that it wasn't Chris and Piers storyline from Resident Evil 6.  I could care less for an action love fest, the WHOLE campaign.\n-Good variety of enemy types: This iteration of the Revelations series has a lot more different versions of enemies and even some old favorites in RAID MODE.  Lots of good character designs and types that let the gameplay feel how it should feel on a per-chapter basis.  A nice take on a regenerating enemies.\n-RAID MODE: A fine addition for anyone that just wants a slight challenge and lots of combat.  Unlocking old costumes for Barry and Claire was fun to play for.\n-Weapon Mods:  Weapon modifications are done easily enough in the campaign and balanced enough in RAID MODE.  Figuring out the best combinations on different weapons can really make all the difference during a boss fight.  RAID MODE does not allow you to take off mods like in campaign mode.  Either you have to destroy the weapon to get the mods back or you have to destroy all equipped mods on the weapon to get the weapon back.\n\nCons:\n-Laser aiming buried in menu: You have to go to settings, then 'Display', then 'Details'.  Instead of something expected like under 'Gameplay'.  STUPID.\n-Graphics and animations: Graphics are not going to match RE 6 levels and should not be expected to be.  This game does well in its art and atmosphere, but will not impress with sheer graphical fidelity.\n-Moira's English Script: Whether she's making another pun of the moment or using curse words in odd ways, Moira is good at talking like a fantasy 10-year-old.  Whoever wrote her script thought that she had to play the typical teenager who seems to have no practice at cursing.  Sometimes the good ol' lines are best to stick with instead of coming up with new ways to make teens look like try-hards.\n-The inclusion of a bad ending: Normally this would be good as it gives the player some leeway and includes more content.  However I looked up the triggers for the good/bad endings and found that one decision in the middle of the game is the deciding factor.   The trigger could be missed simply if one had been listening to Moira talk the whole time.  I won't spoil the game, but this seems like a dumb way to get a bad ending, as the decision made will get past the encounter either way without any sign that something wrong was done nor that it would affect another certain pair of survivors.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Overall I liked this version of the new Resident Evil gameplay systems the most and it shows the most polish in my opinion.  While it can't beat out the originals in my book as they would have to be classed within they're dated context, this was by far the best implementation of Over The Shoulder gameplay since RE 4.  I would highly recommend this game to anybody that had doubts as to the direction of Resident Evil going forward.  If Revelations 1 showed us the possibilities of Resident Evil, then Revelations 2 will further show that if Capcom treats her right, the series can live on.\n\n\n","July 15, 2015","true","99.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This resident evil has some really stupid hard bosses that work legit JUST LIKE classic bosses in RE 1 and 2 / 3 and that made me extremely happy to see, ( considering the stupid freaking bosses from RE5 and 6, " look at me I'm some giant worm on a boat lul shoot me wif stuff " non of that BS )\n6 I did have some parts where I was feeling a bit scared which I haven't felt in RE since maybe the classics, and I love scary games and it takes a lot to scare me ( look at my Pro pic, freaking loved Silent Hill 3 )\n7 Gameplay is fun to me, even with the big change in RE 4 with a 3rd person type thing going on, I like how it played and yes you can aim and walk.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~FINAL VERDICT ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIf you're looking for a new RE game that feels like the old, this is as close as you will get, story wise; and little things like the boss fights and the pretty bad voice acting, leaves you with a feeling of RE1/2/3\nIf you like the way RE 6 / 5 / 4 was gameplay wise you'll like this one.\nIf you're like me and freaking of Merc mode, buy this game now and have tons of fun.\nGreat Game > Bad Game,\nDon't come into this game thinking it will be RE 1/2/3 those games will sadly NEVER make it now in game companies for some STUPID reason. Look at this as some fun, and how RE is suppose to be with the game play of newer games.","September 27, 2015","true","64.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm not sure I'd suggest buying the whole package. You can just buy an episode and play raid mode. The problem is I am struggling to find anyone in matchmaking except for the randomly generated mission search, but who wants to spend time in that? So I cant suggest anyone buy this now UNLESS you have friends to play with. In that case, I'd say at least buy episode 1. Be warned that this is a very grindy and repeatitive mode but if you like a little Borderlands mixed in with your Resident Evil, its quite nice.\n\nBut the campaign itself, while only 3 hours for one episode, was surprisingly good. I really like the control refinements here. Its taken some inspiration from Alan Wake, I would say. The gunplay is reliable and the partner system is pretty much hassle free and a nice addition.

You play as Claire Redfield who's accompanied by none other than Barry Burton's daughter Moira. The first parts of each level are awesome! You start to get the hang of where in the storyline you are because it jumps back and forth between 6months. The monsters are wicked, and the She-Wesker is ugly AF! I highly recommend the game, my only issue is with some of the cutscenes and recaps... they tend to either skip or not follow with the dialogue.\n\nThe scenery is amazing, just like being able to use Natalia's ability to sense when monsters are near by and where to target them which really helps out a lot during Barry's levels.

The first episode was on sale for 79p whilst all the other episodes were not discounted at all. The publisher must be extremely confident that you will get hooked after the first episode to do that. However this did not work on me, after the first episode I was left with the overwhelming impression that it was okay but had no desire to buy the rest of the game.\n\nThe campaign's plot so far is intriguing, the way the story is told by splitting it into two parts is excellent. The combat is mostly uninspiring shooting dribbly monsters in the face. The character switching felt a bit forced in the first half where one character had guns and the other had a torch with no good reason why they both couldn't have guns and a torch. However the switching worked much better in the second half where you had a tough guy with all the weapons and a creepy child who can see monsters through walls. So overall it is reasonably enjoyable.\n\nThere was also a boring raid mode where you need to just repeatedly kill a bunch of monsters to level up your character and unlock things to kill more monsters. This didn't hold my attention for long.\n\nSo overall I feel I got my 79 pence's worth out of this first episode but I am in no hurry to spend twenty odd quid to get the rest of the game.","April 29","true","3.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I enjoyed the two person teams for the missions.\n\nOn the downside, it was a little easy to get lost in the dark on the second part of episode. perhaps that's part of the fun, but I wasn't sure if I was going in the right direction.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuki8/recommended/287290/","kuki8","Kuki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuki8/","129 products in account","Surprisingly, this game is really great and the best of the RE series that I played so far. Why? Because this is a true horror survival - not a action oriented shooter horror like RE 5 - but more true to the originals and as one of few horror games out there that works perfectly in co-op mode (Once you are ingame after the intro, press start on your two gamepads and you are set) ! The split-screen co-op with gamepads is fantastically implemented, the roles for the two players are very different making it more interesting. The pace of the game is perfect. Most importantly though, this game has NONE of those ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous quick-time events that I hated so much in RE 5 and 6. Good riddance to those.\n\nThis is just a really good survival horror game with a good story that goes on with a good pace. It has none of the weaknesses RE 5 and RE 6 had, such as silly dialogs, action sequences and story. Instead it just comes off as well polished.\n\nThe only thing I miss a bit from RE 5 is the ability sell items and upgrade your weapons and this feeling of general ammo scarcity. This is perfectly made up by the fact that this game is overall much better than RE 5 and probably more true to the first RE parts. The upgrading in RE:Revelations 2 happens via items you find, and the upgrades can be attached / detached when you find a bench. There are also skills you can unlock globally for certain/all characters, using XP you collect by completing missions.\n\nImo, this game should have been named RE 6, and RE 6 should be named as some action spin-off of the series. This game is the real dea l and catches the real spirit of the series, forget RE 6.","May 26","true","4.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/287290/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Overall, from what I can tell from the first episode, the campaign is great. Claire's portion feels a lot like The Evil Within, but a lot more restrained resource-wise. The Survival difficulty is balanced to bring back that old RE feeling of every bullet counting, without being almost unplayable like Revelations 1's Infernal difficulty was.  Barry's campaign is similar to the side campaigns in Revelations where you begin with more weaponry and the gameplay is more action-oriented, similar to RE5. His campaign also introduces rudimentary stealth elements, but they seem largely unnecessary even on Survival unless you're like me and just went with it anyways for the sport of it.\n\nThe only thing that bothers me is that there isn't any sort of campaign co-op. In RE5 and 6, I felt like the co-op was an unnecessary addition, and I felt that survival horror was best when you're isolated. But in this game, where the side characters are more support characters than actual full roles (Moira and Natalia are only able to attack using melee, with Natalia only being able to use bricks found in the environment and largely relying on Barry), I feel like co-op could add a really interesting dynamic to the game. The game does support couch co-op on the console versions, but this was removed from the PC version. I can understand why Capcom might think that people might not be interested in playing this game in co-op due to the fact that the support characters don't necessarily see much "action", but I personally would love playing a support roll for someone else. The lack of co-op doesn't ultimately affect whether or not I would recommend the game to someone, though. If you liked Revelations 1, you'll probably like this too.","February 25, 2015","true","26.9"," 30 of 61 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","30","61","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/houstoniscool/recommended/287290/","houstoniscool","Houston","http://steamcommunity.com/id/houstoniscool/","388 products in account","**This is the first time i've written a review before, so bear with me.\nResident Evil Revelations 2 is......interesting.\nThe game is presented kind of like how the first Revelations was...... but not.\n\nLets start at the story.\n\nPlot\nClaire Redfield and Moira Burton get kidnapped from some "TerraSafe" company party. (company that will only exist for a single game)\nThey wake up on this secluded island, where almost everyone in TerraSafe is assumingly being butchered and tortured.\nScary men with weapons try to stab you.\nBarry Burton finds a signal that Moira sent, so he finds the island. (How no one else could is beyond me quite frankly)\nHe meets a creepy little girl who appears to have escaped from captivity.\nAnd that is literally it. (Without spoiling anything!)\n\nThe relationship between Moira and Barry seems fairly rocky and could/will lead into a heartfelt reunion, but other than that, nothing much actually happens or sets up the next chapter. The "On the next episode" is fairly interesting, but I won't give that away.\n\nAesthetics\nThe game shares the same kind of graphic style from Revelations 1, but instead of a creepy looking boat, we get a creepy looking prison that reminds me a lot of the Evil Within. The definitely looks nice, but its nothing spectactular. The only things that were notably cool were the fog effects while playing as Barry outside, and a new enemy you encounter later looks fairly neat. The game, however, links with a previous iteration in the series, so the whole look of that specific enemy feels more or less ripped off. The normal enemies for Claire's section all see to be pretty neat looking, even though they aren't exactly introduced really smoothly. The enemies in Barry's section are bland zombie models that look like every other single zombie from anything. The games atmosphere isn't exactly as engaging as I would have hoped, but it did the job of keeping my attention. The only reason the atmosphere doesn't shine like it should is because of a lack of build-up in tension, and a lack of any real pressure. (Does atmosphere fall under aesthetics? oh well.)\n\nGameplay & Controls\nThe game has a similar style of controls to the first Revelations, but it feels a lot smoother in this game. Claire handles well, and never seems to get stuck in a three-point turn due to the amazing tank controls that the series was built on. During some portions, you might need to switch to your accompanying partner to solve a partner, or to locate items. Oh yeah, they got rid of the scanning thing. Now all you have to do is look at the item with your partner and you can pick it up. (Thank you jesus)\nYour partner seems to be incapable of using a weapon no matter who you play with, so usually you have to defend them from enemies. While playing as Moira, you can stun enemies with a flashlight, and combo them with a crowbar. This is probably the most convenient way to deal with your foes, since it costs literally no ammo. The weapons you get for Barry and Claire feel like they should be reserved for a special enemy or occasion, but the game never presents you with a difficult situation. At all.\nThe game was fairly easy on normal difficulty, so switching to the harder difficulty might be necessary if you are blowing through all the enemies with easy.\nDid I mention it is under 3 hours to complete?\nYeah, 3 hours.\nThere is, however, a Raid Mode, which has a really interesting presentation. It is mission-based like the first game, but in here, you get to customize your characters skills and taunts and weapons in a more enjoyable manner. I haven't played much of the Raid Mode, but once I do, I'll update my review. (If anyone cares about it)\n\nPerformance\nThe game ran silky smooth for me, except for some weird jittering with Claire's model in the beginning of the game. The game has what I assume to be loading screens at certain doors, but they all pass very fast. (Just a quick fade to black and back.)\n\nOverall\nThe game was fun.... but lacking. It is sorta unfair to judge the game without the entire game being out, but it's also unfair to release the game episode at a time. (Cmon dudes. :c )\nWith more content, It will most likely be easier to give this game an appropriate rating, so I will be updating this review as the game releases more content. (Only if the review has anyone's interest.)\n\nFinal Score : 7/10\nEven as a die-hard RE fan, I had really low expectations going in, but I was pleasantly incorrect on those assumptions. The game seems to have a fair amount of content IF you include Raid Mode currently, but really lacks in any kind of pacing or replayability for the first Episode. I'm excited to see the second Episode, since the preview tickled me fancy.\nAlso, Barry is the man so who wouldn't want to play as him??\n(Forgot to mention, quite a few Resident Evil 1 references that actually made me chuckle. GG)\n\nThanks for reading my review! If anyone is dying to talk about what they felt with the game, feel free to message me.\nHave Fun!\n\n(EDIT: I did write a review for a steam badge a while back. I am a fraud.\nAlso Claire's butt is really awesome and should be a deciding factor in your purchase honestly.\nAnd I don't play co-op too often, so it will be added to the review when it's in the game.\nALSO, Thanks for the Valentine correction, I slipped up.)","February 25, 2015","true","5.6"," 95 of 192 people (49%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","49","95","192","15","21"

Recently I got Episode 1 as a gift from the Humble Bundle. I actually enjoyed it for a while and I felt that the $20 for the rest of the season was worth the time I had already spent with it. Ultimately I got my money’s worth out of Raid Mode, but the campaign is ♥♥♥♥ and why I can’t recommend it. My suspicions of the game being a mess due to ripping off disparate elements from other popular action horror games at the time (i.e. Last of Us, Evil Within) proved true as the campaign is just a mess and it’s unable to decide what it wants to be. Enemies are numerous and tend to keep respawning and ammo is scare but they are very few options to avoid enemies. There are tricks like how Moira can regen and Claire can melee enemies while she’s AI controlled so you can kill enemies without wasting ammo but they still love throwing damage-sponge enemies at you where that trick won’t be very effective. I just stopped at Episode 2 because it just became a slog. It’s good to see Claire and Barry back, but they can’t make up for the rest of the campaign.\n\nRaid Mode is fun, especially with a buddy, but it can be pretty grindy. As I said though, I enjoyed what I played of it.  It’s a shame that Capcom screwed this game up, because if they just improved on Rev 1’s formula without slapping together elements from other games it could have been real good.","October 30, 2015","false","16.6"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","4"

My other 7 or 8 attempts to start this mode has resulted in a crash of the game.\n\nAs other people have stated the description of this game is a straight-up lie. There is no offline or online co-op to speak of.\n\nSomething which I noticed which nobody else has really seemed to mention in these reviews is how the audio in this game is just downright broken. For anyone that doesn't already know, this game incorporates the usage of 2 characters at all times where they attempt to help eachother out and overcome challenges and "puzzles". Every now and then these characters exchange utterances, and if you are unfortunate enough to pan your camera angle a few degrees half-way through their mindless chatter then it will sound as though one character is letting out a slight murmur from several miles  away.\n\nAnother thing which people fail to point out is how downright atrocious the control settings are. I'm a PC gamer through-and-through and the mouse control is completely unusable because the default sensitivity has you doing 360 degree spins at the slightest movement - and to make matters worse is the total lack of "mouse sensitivity" setting available. Plugging in a 360 controller remedies this issue somewhat - but even then there is no option available to alter controller sensitivity.\n\n£5 for a quarter of a "game". 36 minutes of gameplay, dated visuals, among the worst optimisation I've seen of any PC release ever, lies on the store page, half of the game modes are literally broken, faulty audio and uninspiring control settings.\n\n1/10 Would only recommend as a torture device.","February 26, 2015","false","3.0"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

Claire and Moira get kidnapped and find themselves in an abandon prison. You're trying to survive and make it out alive.   Barry is trying to find his daughter Moira as he gotten a distress call from her. Barry finds a girl on the island named Natalia and he keeps her company while trying to find his daughter.\n\nGameplay is much improved from the first Revelations and looks even better. You can change your character on the fly with a push of a button. Each person has their own abilites. For example, Moira has a flashlight and a crowbar. She can use the flash light to find and highlight items, Blind enemies, or use a crowbar to beat up on someone, open up heavier boxes/doors.  While Claire uses weapons that you find.  Revelations 2 is its own story and you don't have to play the first one to understand whats going on.  The game plays fine with a controller/ keyboard and has a bunch of graphical settings you can set compared to the last game. So you can beef up the game to your liking.  If you enjoyed playing Resident Evil Revelations or any Resident Evil game then this game is right up your alley.\n\nThis game sort has a throwback feel of past Resident Evil games and also an Resident Evil 5 feel when your swaping around your characters.  So far I played the first chapter of the game and im having fun shooting up zombies / mutated monsters.  I played on hard took me around 4 hrs to beat the first chapter. You also get acess to raid mode, which has another level of weapons and abilities. Where you can earn points to upgrade your weapons and perks.   I purchased the complete season. However, say if you wanted to try out a chapter the pricing of $5.99 is surprising well priced for the amount of content you get in the chapter.  There is up to 4 chapters / 2 bonus chapters. A new one is getting released each week, this game is going with an episodic feel with a cliff hanger at the end so far. Can't wait to play the next installment.   I would recommend this 3rd person horror Shooter, would give this game a shot when you see this on steam sale.","February 25, 2015","true","20.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

Environments are pulled directly from RE6, now, this could be cool if implimented properly or feel cheap and unfortunately it's the former.\n\nCombat is decent enough, if nothing special, but hideous frame drops render it unplayable. We're talking single digits here, and I'm running a Quad-core 4GHZ i7 and GTX970. Absolutely unacceptable.\n\n"Modern" Interface design, which seems totally out of place in a RE title. Flat, boring and worst of all visually confusing.\n\nBut what's really disturbing is the whole "Freemium" vibe Raid mode gives off. Everythings been economised with in game currencyt to an absurd degree, and I mean everything -- starting missions, "decrypting" records (The game wastes your time letting you know you've "successfully" decrypted an item, rather than just showing you it's stats! But you get a chime that makes you feel good!) The whole thing reeks of a disgusting Skinner Box.\n\n♥♥♥♥ you Capcom. I'm getting tired of your ♥♥♥♥.

It's not terrible, but not a game I can wholeheartedly recommend.\n\nThe price isn't that bad, and the DLC (besides the episodes themselves) is entirely optional. The main game mode is pretty much what you'd expect from a Revelations game. There has been very little development in terms of mechanics, and the controls feel a little clunky and unpolished, particularly with mouse and keyboard. The same goes for the graphics. This game could have easily been made several years back from the way it looks and feels. The story so far is typical RE fare and I am having trouble getting invested in it. Perhaps the later episodes will bring more interesting content and story. Perhaps not. I'm not holding my breath...\n\nIf you absolutely need an RE fix, I guess there are worse things you could buy. To anyone else, I'd say it's not really an essential game to own. You won't miss much skipping it.

Есть классические и новые персонажи (отдельный большой + за БЭРРИ), графика лучше чем в первой, отличный сеттинг, звук ♥♥♥♥♥♥, есть пугающие моменты (гораздо лучше чем в первой части). В плане ДЛС все шикарно и не могу понять почему люди негодуют. По моему все максимально справедливо : не хочешь покупать все эпизоды вместе с костюмами и доп. персонажами для рейд мода - ПОЖАЛУЙСТА, покупай только эпизоды по мере их выхода, если умер пока проходил миссию в рейд моде - ПОЖАЛУЙСТА, купи кристалл и возродись (в первых резидентах такой опции не было, ты умер значит начинай заново, а здесь у вас просто есть выбор и все).\nИгра однозначно стоит своих денег. Если говорить про минусы, то все что я видел это поправимо, например : при первом запуске все было на мин. настройках и возможность поменять настройки мне дали только уже после начала игры (в глав меню есть только начать игру и выход), еще нету коопа, НО он будет, ну и ....в общем то это все, никаких фризов и зависаний я не обнаружил, и у меня комп средний, все настройки на максимуме.\nВ итоге, по первому эпизоду и оффлайновой части рейд мода видно что игра достойная, и из современных интерпретации резидента это самое близкое по настроению к первым частям франшизы, однозначно рекомендую настоящим фанатам серии. 8/10","February 25, 2015","true","17.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The torch is essential for locating pickups much like Jill's scanner in RE: R 1. But it's when Moira also gets the crowbar that the fun starts:\n\nTip: When there are single enemies, choose Moira and use her torch to blind the creature. Claire eventually wades in automatically with her melee knocking him to the ground. Then smash him with Moira's crowbar - this saves on a lot of ammo.\n\nRE: R 2 isn't without its problems. Framerates can get horrendous during combat, especially with multiple enemies. But this should be sorted eventually with the inevitable patches. The graphics are ok and don't warrant the framerate drops, whilst the cut-scenes are quaintly old-school.\n\nDespite this, as an old-school Resi fan, I'm really enjoying the game so far, and can wholeheartedly recommend it to any fan of the genre. 8.5/10\n\n\nEdit:\n\nOk, so we're the third episode in and, despite a couple of patches, the framerate for the single-player campaign is anywhere from fair to atrocious.

I found both 4 and Revelations to be the most fun by far.\n\nCurrently revelations 2 feels like a mix of RE4 and Revelations with a small bit of 5/6.  The basic controls are the same as revelations, but there is a true inventory system like the one in RE5.\n\nA feature that I am currently ambivalent towards is the partner swapping feature.  While the support character has useful abilities, they cannot use guns and as such their ability to fight is severely limited.  Additionally the hidden items in the area can only be seen at all with the support character.\n\nI did have framerate dips here and there, but nothing to bad.\n\nAs for the co-op features, I didn't get the game for co-op, but fully understand the issues with no offline co-op on the PC version when it was advertised as having it.\n\nCurrently I would recommend it if you are OK with the lack of co-op and enjoyed RE Revelations and RE4.\n\nEdit: As for the day one DLC, it's raid mod characters, costumes, and inventory slots.  If you REALLY need those extra inventory slots, then it's a microtransaction.  Personally I never even came close to running out of inventory slots in revelations 1, so there might be no issue here.\n\nEdit 2:  A couple of new things now that episode 2 is out.  It's telling me to purchase the next episode, despite my having bought the complete season.  So, that needs to be fixed ASAP or I'll be droping this to not recommended.\n\nSecond, having played more raid mode I've noticed a lot more issues with frame rate drops in certain maps.  Particuarly defense and timed maps.  As for the new features and changes to raid mode, there don't seem to be any real hidden things in the maps (or at least I havn't found them) like the BSAA medallions in revelations 1 raid mode.  Additionally there are basically 3-4 ammo boxes in each map, and at most 3 weapon or part boxes.\n\nThe combining weapon mods to level them up is a feature I like, since it does make it far easier to get  better mods that you want, and I feel that the mods being locked to the weapon they're installed on until you either destroy a part to free a slot or destroy the weapon to free the parts makes it a bit more challenging to decide on a loadout.\n\nThe character options also allow for much more customization, similar to the RE6 skill loadouts.  Each character has a different set of skills, which are unlocked as that character levels up.   You use skill points to upgrade the skills that you want, to match your playstyle.  This includes the secondary grenades, which are limited use per mission skills.","February 25, 2015","true","85.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Once I lowered the Frame and everything it ran pretty smoothly. To see Barry Burton again is a nice surprise. Graphics in Revelations 1 was much better (well, at least that what I thought)\nBut what the most thing is that sucks and ♥♥♥♥s it up is that PTW option.

Sure didn't see anything for that there. Resident Evil 6 had the fun part that you could join in the game (also as a zombie in some specific levels, attacking the player again and again and again, which made his playthrough a bit harder but also more interesting) or you play with others some sort of raid modes.

The combat styled and gameplay is much improved from Revelations, the story's first episode isn't as great but the next couple start to pick up the pace and the feel for the horror genre of what resident evil was once was. The only downside is not so great port for the PC with a frame lock at 120 frames and really bad frame issues from looking at some parts of the map.

Glad the arcady actio-feeling gameplay is seperate from the Story Mode and can be found  in Raid Mode to create a diverse mix of Survival Horror - Action. Its a fine addition to the game and will keep people clocking in those hours thanks to its RPG-Esque additive gameplay although the missions/gauntlets dont feel as varied as I would like but its enough would still like to have some of the challenge that was present in the orignal Raid Mode in Rev1.

But I cannot down rate it either.\n\nThe story is alright: survival horror is done right, I was really scared of glasps. Ammo is scarce, especially on higher difficulties, you'll get more points instead of the ammo. The plot is great too: lots of references to past RE games, we finally got Claire back, but I really hate that stupid Barry's appearance change, (Scratched that because I solved this prob with a mod replacing his face with the one from Remaster). I also like that some of the mechanics from RE6 are back, like finishers. It kept me playing until I got all achievements and S ranks on all episodes and difficulties.\n\nAnd now to the most disappointing part - the Raid Mode. At first it was really exciting, I've been replaying the first episode for 50 hours. All these new additions - passive and active skills they are really great addition to Raid. You can build up your own set of skills and create various play styles. There were only 2 gauntlets +1 I got from Throwback Map pack. I was looking forward to release of online feature and a new difficulty. Eventually after release of the last episode, the online feature was delayed, and we got a new difficulty which doesn't change enemy spawns, has 4 chests instead of 3, and all enemies were 6 levels above you. This couldn't bring any challenge. I've finished new difficulty a week before online was released. Then they promised to raise difficulty, and I had high hopes for this... and what did they do eventually? They've risen the enemy's level by 15 above yours.. Considering the power of my current guns, I can beat literally any stage on any difficulty with lvl 1. There was nothing new after online was released, you can't even perform grapple breakers in co-op game which is ridiculous, though you can perform them in campaign, how screwed up is that?\n\nConclusion: 7/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spencicles/recommended/287290/","Spencicles","Trip Fisk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spencicles/","338 products in account","I'm asounted at the level of whininess and belligerence directed at this game. Performance issues aside, Resident Evil Revelations 2 is quite good. Many of the people attacking it aren't judging it as a game, and half the criticism comes across as petty and irrational. I never would have expected anyone to get so bent out of shape over no local coop. That's LOCAL coop. As in not online coop. I don't even care if it was mistakenly advertized, the backlash came across as more of a childish manufactured mass temper tantrum than a legit complaint.\n\nanyway\n\ntl;dr version: campaign is quite good. raid mode (while it hooked me) is ok but lazy and very simple to break and make TOO easy.\n\nThis game is running off the same engine used for RE6. At first I was worried since RE6 was a terrible game with a terrible engine, but its been tweaked. The controls are tight and fluid and have been reconfigured to be more intuitive and arcadey. It works. Graphically, the game looks great but isn't perfect at the moment. There are frame rate issues, some stuttery camera issues, and some animation issues. Mostly because the game is still new and hasn't been optimized yet.\n\nAnyway, Revelations comes in 2 flavors: campaign and raid mode.\n\nCampaign:\n\nThis mode has been polished the most performance wise. Revelations 2 has some stuttering, frame drop issues and goofy graphics issues, but once everything is loaded and working proper, it looks and animates really well. I'm making a point of this since its not the same for raid mode.\n\nIf you buy the game for the campaign, you're in for a treat. It is quite good. The story thus far is compelling and mysterious. Capcom has made an attempt to get back to the game's roots by making items and ammunition scarce in turn making the enemies more scary and dangerous as a threat.\n\nHowever, there are permanent character buffs and weapon modding systems in place that do make the game easier potentially turning it into cakewalk like most recent REs allow.\n\nAlso, and I don't know why Capcom keeps doing this with RE games, they've designed the game around a partner system again. So you've got a real dumb AI sidekick that tends to help you in battle by starting at you and getting hit by enemies. Thankfully you can switch between the two characters so if you get downed, you can switch and pick your partner up. Very unlike RE5 when your AI controlled partner would stand next to you and watch you die.\n\nRaid Mode:\n\nJust like Revelations 1, this is the arcadey action mode of Revelations 2. Kind of like mercernaries mode in the older RE's, but expanded upon.\n\nperformance wise, raid mode is terrible. Certain maps will frame stutter and lag badly. I have an R9 270x video card, and the first 30 seconds map 6 in gauntlet I is like a slide show no matter what the game's settings are.\n\nRaid mode in Revelations 2 is a departure from Revelations 1's. In Revelations 1, each map was a sequence taken from the campaign and modified into a 3rd person shooter stage. It threw in level progression that would unlock various weapons, characters, and power ups. You could also farm stages for better items. Playing the same level on a harder difficulty yielded different enemy spawns and spawn locations, so each difficulty made the same stage completely different.\n\nHowever, in Revelations 2, each map is tiny and short and is ripped from RE6 and rarely from Revelations 1 (wtf?). Enemy spawns and spawn locations NEVER change between difficulties. Harder difficulties merely speed enemies up and add more obnoxious status/elemental buffs. Oddly, when enemies spawn they stand up at the same sluggish easy to shoot in the head rate regardless of difficulty. Its actually quite boring. I don't know if this will change once all the chapters are released, but this is what raid mode is currently.\n\nIn contrast to the boring levels, Revelations 2 fleshed out the character system tremendously. Instead of having a player level shared between all characters like in Revelations 1, each character has their own individual experience and level gains. As characters level, they unlock new slots for skills and weapons. They also come with their own personal skill sets and earn skill points to purchase and upgrade said skills. Its neat, but seems a bit wasted next to how basic the stages are.\n\nThe only thing that remains mostly the same in raid mode is the weapon system. Weapons still come with their own level, but the level no longer exists as a restriction (a lvl 1 guy can use a lvl 75 gun which is nerfed to lvl 1 strength). There are also uncommon guns, gun titles, as well as rare named weapon variations same as Revealtions 1. Rev 2 retains the gun parts system where you earn and pick up and attach gun powerups. Power ups seem to be a little more generic this time however. Currently, its very possible to upgrade a weapon that makes raid mode boring and easy. Very unlike Revelations 1 where the hardest difficulties were still hard as f*ck even if you had a fantastic weapon.\n\nmy biggest complaint with Resident Evil Revelations 2: I can't play as the guy who looks like Conan O'brien from Resident Evil Revelations 1.\n\nAnyway, if you made it this far, good job. I wasted too much time typing up a review that will likely not be read.","March 8, 2015","true","176.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This has quite a bit more action than RE 1 - 3 which will, naturally, leave the earlier fans crying in their diapers. This is, legitimately, my first time writing a review for anything, but after seeing the completely heat-of-the-moment, horribly explained reviews I felt that I had to butt in.\n\nTo start off, yes, there are some areas in the game where the FPS will drop and you may need to drop your graphics settings down for those areas or you may not. Regardless of what common, completely uneducated opinion might state, games can not run perfectly on every form of machine in the world, they just can't. So everyone shouting "CRAPCOM" when their toaster or AMD machinery doesn't work the way they want them to, I'm sorry (and I'm certain capcom is too)\n\nSo, since this seems to be the way to do these sorts of things, I will list the pros and cons in my opinion\n\n-PROS-\n1.) Controls are smooth, this is against what others have thought, but after you play for a while and work with the skill tree (yes there is a skill tree now) you will see that the game is actually very very smooth in terms of combat and 'feel'\n2.) The atmosphere is absolutely enticing. You may very well crap your pants at times (be warned)\n3.) The boss fight was incredibly fun (there has only been one in all 4 parts to date [no Pedro wasn't a boss people])\n4.) The story is actually very thrilling and can drive you in and hook you, leaving you waiting anxiously for next week\n5.) I really happen to enjoy the whole episodic function of these games, it ties in with RE development really well (you might feel differently)\n6.) The difficulty level of the game (I play on medium difficult) is really enjoyably challenging, I can't wait to do it over on hard mode later on\n\n-CONS-\n1.) The stuttering in certain areas should be fixed, it ruins the atmosphere and can be annoying during combat\n2.) I've read that a lot of people have their mouse on the screen even when playing on a controller. I also play on a controller, even though its whack for aiming, and do not have this problem. This problem, however, can be quickly (in about 5 to 10 minutes) solved with a little google magic.\n3.) Having to listen to all the idiots post about how not having split screen coop is game braking. Since when does being able to play my game on half my 17 inch screen become a requirement? And who the hell would do that to themselves?\n4.) On the other hand, having online coop for both story and Raid Mode would be an excellent addition to this game, and like DLC, I really look forward to it in the future.\n\nAll-in-all, it is a really great RE games with actually believable story, for the most part. Combat is fun, challenging, and at times left me with a smile on my face (whether I was getting slaughtered or commiting the slaughter)\n","March 7, 2015","true","22.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

So it's definitely worth it and I highly recommend it to any resident evil fan. It's got all the nostalgia, some corny lines, a virus, gross stuff, jump scare, tight corridors, and no bad camera angles thank god. Invisible mode is pretty horrible to play through but highly challenging. Also depicts references to other Resident Evils including the very first one..... and most of all Barry makes a return since.. RE, the very first one. Oh and different endings!\n\nAlso performance and technical issues described below are now much much improved and is more stable.\n\nMarch 12\nI like the dodge system in that you actually shouldn't dodge/evade your body into a weapon because you think it'll provide i-frames. So yea... do watch where the weapon is coming from which direction and where you want to move away from.\n\nThe past&future system is very nice I like how choices you make during the past significantly affect the future character's campaign and that the future character isn't exactly following a same recycled map either with large deviations after running through partially the same map the past character went through.\n\nProblems are there aren't any online co-op until the game is fully released sadly... so for those of us who purchased it early we gotta wait 4 weeks, anyone buying it after the Mar.17th /2015 you should have co-op available or the game really done-fkedup. Other problems that people with weaker computer specs might experience a lot of technical difficulties or technical griefing(e.g. fps dropping to atrocious levels where the game is unplayable, during certain game modes like invisible mode monsters appearing/reappearing cause horrible frame lag for unknown reasons, a lot of end-user made fixes not developer made fixes to work around THEIR problems...)\n\nAside from that I think it's a good resident evil game, although the partner thing that has occurred in the previous sequels and this most recent title really doesn't help instil horror. Though tight corridors and strange looking freaks will sort of tense you up for the first bit.

So it's definitely worth it and I highly recommend it to any resident evil fan. It's got all the nostalgia, some corny lines, a virus, gross stuff, jump scare, tight corridors, and no bad camera angles thank god. Invisible mode is pretty horrible to play through but highly challenging. Also depicts references to other Resident Evils including the very first one..... and most of all Barry makes a return since.. RE, the very first one. Oh and different endings!\n\nAlso performance and technical issues described below are now much much improved and is more stable.\n\nMarch 12\nI like the dodge system in that you actually shouldn't dodge/evade your body into a weapon because you think it'll provide i-frames. So yea... do watch where the weapon is coming from which direction and where you want to move away from.\n\nThe past&future system is very nice I like how choices you make during the past significantly affect the future character's campaign and that the future character isn't exactly following a same recycled map either with large deviations after running through partially the same map the past character went through.\n\nProblems are there aren't any online co-op until the game is fully released sadly... so for those of us who purchased it early we gotta wait 4 weeks, anyone buying it after the Mar.17th /2015 you should have co-op available or the game really done-fkedup. Other problems that people with weaker computer specs might experience a lot of technical difficulties or technical griefing(e.g. fps dropping to atrocious levels where the game is unplayable, during certain game modes like invisible mode monsters appearing/reappearing cause horrible frame lag for unknown reasons, a lot of end-user made fixes not developer made fixes to work around THEIR problems...)\n\nAside from that I think it's a good resident evil game, although the partner thing that has occurred in the previous sequels and this most recent title really doesn't help instil horror. Though tight corridors and strange looking freaks will sort of tense you up for the first bit. But once you're used to it the fear dissipates quick.\n\nPlaying single player in this game controlling two characters I find is also very smooth, was skeptical at first and thought it would be extremely clunky but the switching between characters is so quick you can practically use both of them in combat to ground stab a guy on the floor at the same time\n\nFor the price it's not bad, I definitely wouldnt've paid 59.99(like RE6) for it but for 24.90 on the full story campaign it's not bad.

Outside of those two things, the glaring issues are the lack of co-op. I mean lack, like no split screen and no online play. As far as I know, the online will be released soon, possibly because Capcom is setting up servers or a feeling of obligation to not have a riot on their hands. I have no idea, but Capcom had no intention of giving local split-screen to the PC. Capcom isn't saying why, but I guess it is something involving the engine and handling keyboard/mouse with a controller, I don't know, I'm spitballing things at this point.\n\nSomething to remember is this, Capcom makes good games. But, you always need to wait and say "Ok, now what'll happen when I do get this/what'll the wait time be until this game is optimal?" I bought this game with the promise of local split-screen and online play, but the latter will be a free update soon. So, already I was dooped out of $40 for the "all encompassing" version of this game. Wesker and HUNK are good DLC characters, but that doesn't justify the serious lack of features at the moment.\n\nThe story is engaging, for the most part, and will conclude in about a month. So, I dunno what to tell you. Wait until then to see if this nonsense is settled such as the stuttering animations (seriously? what's going on with that?), or buy it now but prepare to play Raid mode alone for a bit.","February 26, 2015","true","31.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Outside of those two things, the glaring issues are the lack of co-op. I mean lack, like no split screen and no online play. As far as I know, the online will be released soon, possibly because Capcom is setting up servers or a feeling of obligation to not have a riot on their hands. I have no idea, but Capcom had no intention of giving local split-screen to the PC. Capcom isn't saying why, but I guess it is something involving the engine and handling keyboard/mouse with a controller, I don't know, I'm spitballing things at this point.\n\nSomething to remember is this, Capcom makes good games. But, you always need to wait and say "Ok, now what'll happen when I do get this/what'll the wait time be until this game is optimal?" I bought this game with the promise of local split-screen and online play, but the latter will be a free update soon. So, already I was dooped out of $40 for the "all encompassing" version of this game. Wesker and HUNK are good DLC characters, but that doesn't justify the serious lack of features at the moment.\n\nThe story is engaging, for the most part, and will conclude in about a month. So, I dunno what to tell you. Wait until then to see if this nonsense is settled such as the stuttering animations (seriously? what's going on with that?), or buy it now but prepare to play Raid mode alone for a bit.","February 26, 2015","true","31.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The pacing is really good and fun, violent action as well as slower moments of exploring the creepy hallways both coexist. The game is often surprisingly scary, especially in the second act where you control Barry.\n\nAnd that's just the first two hours of the game: After that, there's the Raid Mode which turns out to be a completely different game in and of itself. It contains of a bunch of unique levels (not just recycled ones from the single player campaign). You have to shoot your way through them, earn points, purchase new skills and weapons, earn trophies, unlock new levels and then do it all again with another character. It unfolds an incredibly depths and enables a variety of completely different play styles and I'll probably sink many hours into it.\n\nThat's what I got for just 6€. It's an incredibly good value for a well produced and polished game (especially the game play). After all the discussions of The Order: 1886 I hope this game might serve as an example of how smaller AAA games can succeed with a more humble pricing and a high focus on gameplay. Resident Evil Revelations 2 has one priority: offering an enjoyable and fun time.","March 4, 2015","true","36.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But of course it's not like old Resident Evil games yet, and it's not perfect.\n\nLet's start with bad sides of the game. At first, this game DOESN'T have co-op scenario! It's not a big problem for me cause i love the times game leaves me all alone but for those wants to play with a friend, it's a stupid thing. Also it's obviously a console port and this causes bad performance and framedrops sometimes. And last thing, the game has puzzles like find the key, turn on the power and go to the next area. They're so easy and won't put you in stress. I would prefer harder puzzles like puzzles of Silent Hills.\n\nAnd now you're reading good sides. Both of the Claire and Barry scenarios stays away from stupid Hollywood action. Action scenes of RE6 makes me sick because... B.O.W.s with motorcycle? F... OFF!!! Revelations 2 feels more like a Survival/Horror game and that makes me say "Yeah Capcom done right this time.". Other good thing about it, it gives you limited ammo and herb also enemies are fast and hard to kill. If you're gonna fight with them, you'd better think twice. I wasn't expecting creativity and i was right about it. Most of the mechanics taken from the first Revelations and other successful horror franchises. For example, flashlight mechanics taken from Alan Wake or stealth mechanics taken from The Evil Within. You will get it if you played those games. But these taken mechanics really improved the gameplay and controls are much more better than other Resident Evil games. Also i liked the atmosphere. Rusty and dark places, enemies, music and sounds, conversations and cutscenes gives you the tension of the game. Moira swears a lot... But she's a teenager after all and if someone put me in a situation like this i would have swear more then Moira. Scenario looks nice but i can't make final decision until the last episode. Last thing, Claire sandwich part really made me laugh (Did Barry tell everyone about it?) :)\n\nLike i said it's still early to make a decision but i'm really hopeful. I liked first Revelations game too and i liked the first episode. I was preordered game and i'm not regret it. If you wanna buy it now, i would say go on but if you want to wait until the last patch it's OK.\n\nI would give it 8. Just because of bad performance and framedrops.","February 26, 2015","true","16.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I like most of the changes they made, though some are rather annoying and degrade the experience. There's plenty of levels to play through currently and you got enough characters to progress with. Overall good times.\n\nPros- Good bit of content for $6 if you buy the episode individually or $25 if you get the complete season. I managed to get 2 copies at a discount and it is plenty worf so far. Raid mode is the main course while the Story mode is like an appetizer at the current moment.\n\nCons- FPS drops harder that the bass in all dem fancy kazoo songs. Lack of offline co-op for story mode might bother some people, not me really. 2nd player would really only be either holding a flashlight or pointing and throwing bricks. Not too much fun. The real main problem is lack of offline and online co-op for Raid mode. What's the point of fighting off hordes of cancerous infected with the downs if you can't do so with a buddy? Fix the FPS drop and add Raid mode Co-op and I'm a happy camper. Also, the limit of weapons, parts, and discs you can store is terrible. In that regards, it's blantant cash grab with their expansion packs for storage. Bad Capcom, bad.\n\nBottomline- If you enjoyed the first Revelation's Raid mode, then get this game. Best would be getting the complete season as it's cheaper alternative than each individual episode or the retail copy that comes out in March. Unless your internet is bad, then well get the retail. If you're just looking for a quick bit of fun, just buy the episode and play Raid Mode. If you are all enamored with the offline Story Mode Co-op, get the console versions. If you don't like Raid mode then you're just outta luck.","February 26, 2015","true","52.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Capcom fully patched the frame rate issue this time. Shout outs to them. Game runs smooth for me.\n2.Moira actually grew on me, she went from fairly annoying to having some of my favorite lines in the game.\n3. The story was fantastic. Loved it. Raid mode still fun solo, Game is still a 7/10.\nUpdate 3/2/15:\n1. Capcom came through with a patch to remedy the frame rate drops making them incredibly rare, though they still happen when I pan or rotate the camera too fast. My laptop isn't that powerful so that could be why I still see them.\n2.Finished Episode 1! Barry and Natalia are an amazing pair. The father-daughter thing works well for them. Of course Natalia still freaks me out when I spin the camera around and she's just standing there staring at Barry.\n3. If you're like me. impatient, the episodic structure may not be for you. There are a lot of things to do even with 1 episode out (at the time of writing) Waiting for the full game release 3/17 might be your best choice if episodic isn't your style!\n4. With the patch and having experienced more of the story I can definitely recommend this game as stated I now score it at a 7/10 even without the full game being out yet.\n\nWill continue to update throughout the release schedule!\n\nOriginal 2/25/15:\nWritting this from MY experience so far! Score: 6.5/10 will probably go up to about a 7  when fully released and patched.\n\nI'm only giving this a thumbs up because there isn't an in-between rating. I recommend waiting until Capcom releases a fix before buying! Once they fix these things I would definitely recommend it.\n\nRE Revelations 2 as the potenial to be an amazing title, however there are glaring problems:\n1. Frame Rate drops, like most reviews before mine I have experienced drops and freezes. I managed to make them less frequent by lowering my settings a bit, but they are still incredibly noticable. ***Patched***\n2. Co-op functionality, while I personally don't play Resident Evil as a co-op game anyway, we were promised co-op for this version of the game and I expected the option to be available as most others did.***There's a local co-op mod being released/worked on if it's that serious??***\n3. Window settings, there doesn't seem to be a Fullscreen (windowed) option and the Windowed view made the game sluggish. ***No lionger an issue.***\nWhile these things take a fair amount out of the submersion of the game, they don't make it unplayable.\nSome positive notes:\n1. Atmosphere, I'm not too far into Episode 1 but I personally think the Horror aspect is definitely there within the prison setting so far. Had a few jump scares even when I knew that something was going to jump out.\n\n2. Raid Mode, From what I've seen some people experienced crashes here, I however didn't. Incredibly fun mode even solo. I actually think it's more fun/challenging this way.\n\n3. Characters, So far, I think the characters are enjoyable. Claire and Moira have a unique chemistry. Although I don't care for Moira's speech patterns, but she's a teenage girl I didn't expect much. See "Ohmigod"\n\n4. Story, Not much to say here. It's dark, mysterious, and fairly interesting.","February 25, 2015","true","12.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Although the graphics are not astounding, the atmosphere is suitably creepy with varied environments (including a nice homage to the past...). There are creepy enemy encounters, some great tension filled battles in which character switching is very useful, a few shock scares, and one shock scare in particular that *almost* made me scream, haha. There is varied gameplay between the Claire/Moira episodes and the Barry/Natalia episodes. While I generally enjoy stealthy games, I did find myself feeling that Natalia's ability was a bit to powerful and made the stealth component a bit easy. Overall, on Normal the game isn't too difficult, and I was a little surprised that most of the boss battles weren't very tough...I am eager to try the game on hard to see if this changes! Raid mode, although I have only played it for a couple hours, is very fun in an arcade-y, addictive, pick up and play sort of way. Combining this with the multiple difficulty levels, all of the things to search for and find, and all of the medals to attempt to acquire means that you are getting a substantive game for $25.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sailor_moon88/recommended/287290/","sailor_moon88","Sailor Moon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sailor_moon88/","307 products in account","So there has been a lot of negativity surrounding this game, mostly due to the lack of "co-op" that was mentioned on the Steam store page prior to launch, so let me throw my hat into the ring;\n\nFirst of all; Capcom have apologised due to any misunderstandings caused by the way the game was listed on Steam, The have also stated that they are looking into ways of re-implementing the missing split-screen mode.\n\nWith that said, the only co-op in the original Revelations was raid mode, and that game is, and has always been, listed as having 'co-op' on it's Steam store page - I have no idea why some people expected there to be online campaign co-op in Revelations 2 or are annoyed that it doesn't exist. This was never intended, or mentioned, at -any point- during the game's development or the build up to release.\n\nI'd also like to point out that, as mentioned by Capcom (and as was always intended) "Raid mode will support online co-op shortly after launch when a free patch is available for players to download which adds this feature" - So technically, just like the original Revelations, the game will have a co-op feature. There's no 'scam' or 'false advertising' like some of the wild claims other people have been making; This is how the game was intended to be. If you thought differently, you should have done your homework (or played the first Resident Evil Revelations, which would have told you exactly how co-op in this game was going to work).\n\nWith that addressed, I'll move on to the actual game itself:\n\nHaving completed the the first episode of the story, I can say that, so far, the atmosphere is fantastic. The way the game is being released episodically isn't a bad thing, instead of burning through the game in just a couple of days, like a favourite TV series, you have to wait to find out what happens, which aids in building the suspense factor nicely. Can't wait for next week.\n\nThe characters feel like they have been properly worked on rather than just 'copy paste name from RE game here'. I was super excited as a long time RE fan to finally see Barry Burton back, and for the first time (not including that awful gameboy outing) as a playable character, I can say that I'm not disappointed. The scripting and voice acting work is great and goes a long way to making the characters feel 'real' - Moira in particular acts just like you'd expect your typical teenager to.\n\nGameplay is solid. The two-character system is a fantastic feature, instead of just having an AI partner following you around, getting to instantly switch between and fully use both characters is brilliant and helps in just about every situation in the game. Raid mode is fun, and feels like a combination of both old and new "Mercenaries" modes, time attack style gameplay, but with a goal and the ability to kill all enemies in the stage.\n\nGraphically the game looks nice, the character models in particular are very nicely detailed and the environments do their jobs well. Like some other people, I had some performance issues until I tweaked the settings and capped the frame rate, it doesn't run brilliantly by any means, but I wasn't expecting it to on my now outdated 560ti, (I imagine it will run a little better after a couple of patches and a game-ready graphics driver.) No game-breaking bugs or crashing, nothing major on that front.\n\nThe micro-transactions in raid mode aren't anything I would spend my money on, though it seems like all of the stuff in there is completely unnecessary (extra continues should you run out; I've not used a single one yet, extra item storage, items you can get just by playing for the ultra-lazy). It kind of feels like an obvious cash grab attempt and in my opinion, the game would be better off without it... That said, it can be completely ignored and doesn't detract from the gameplay in any way, so it's not a big deal.\n\nSo far, my considered opinion, I'd give this a solid 7/10, stand out point being one of the few games recently that has instantly grabbed my attention and made me care about the story, biggest negatives being the sub-optimal performance and those annoying micro-transactions.\n\nIf you're a fan of Resident Evil, the campaign makes it worth getting now, if you're not that interested in the series and are looking at it from the point of view as it just being a game to play, I'd say stick it on your wish list and wait for the next sale.","February 27, 2015","true","26.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I don't regret my purchase and will definitely play all the future episodes. But the game certainly has many problems, and I honestly don't really expect them to fix any of these as more episodes are released.\n\nGameplay\nThe biggest thing about Revelations 2 is the overhaul to the partners system. Rather than simply having an incompetent AI who won't kill anything and might as well not be there at all, each partner now actually feels valuable. I had my concerns when I saw the trailer and discovered I had to switch control to a second character just so I can shine a flashlight at stuff, but after playing, I realized playing as the "utility character" can actually be pretty fun.\n\nHowever...\n\nWhile the partner actions are well designed, they're very poorly implemented. The AI is still as dumb as ever, and the fact that more is now expected from your partner only makes it worse. During a fight, you can't even predict if your partner will follow you as you run down a corridor... some times they just stand still and get hit!\n\nThere are some fun partner-melee combos in Revelations 2, but you simply cannot expect the AI to properly do their part, so if you want to perform them, it's usually best that you switch back-and-forth and perform both roles by yourself.\n\nIn Revelations 2 you have one "weapons" character who carries all the firearms, and an "utility" character who doesn't really have any weapons at all. Now get this: if you're in control of the utility character, the AI in control of the weapons character WON'T FIRE THE GUNS AT ALL until you've beaten the story and unlocked a perk on the post-game screen, said perk will actually allow them to fire guns and not consume any bullets at all, but at a drastically reduced damage (hint: just have the AI use a weapon with high knock-back power).\n\nAnd while the utility character can indeed do many cool tricks, the game likes to keep those a secret from you until it's too late. There are many moments where you will have barely survived an onslaught, and the game will tell you, "BY THE WAY, YOU COULD'VE DONE THIS AND AVOIDED ALL THAT TROUBLE ALTOGETHER." Come on, seriously?\n\nStory\nGameplay complaints aside, I did enjoy the story. The decision to do episodic releases is kind of weird - I guess they wanted a share of The Walking Dead's success. But the first episode did end on an interesting cliffhanger, and I'm curious to find out what happens next.\n\nRaid Mode\nRaid Mode is mostly the same as it was Revelations 1. It's very grindy and not quite as fun as Mercenaries. It's enjoyable though. If you have the patience to get through the boring early levels, you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised at the variety of enemies this mode offers.\n\nI'm not sure if this is exclusive to the Throwback Map pack, but I've played through quite a few stages taken from RE6. It's fun to start a mission and be thrown into a familiar setting. The downside is that revisiting these levels will really make you realize how inferior the graphics are in this game.","February 27, 2015","true","58.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It may not be a return to "Survival Horror" in its most true format - but it does have elements of it, blended with the more recent 'action' style of previous titles. It won't scare you - but a surprisingly fresh and haunting soundtrack (with gentle nods to movies such as The Thing - and even a subtle hint of Star Wars) compliments light touches of gameplay creepiness or tension.\n\nUnlike previous titles (RE5/RE6), duo-character play see's each character having their own unique abilities, whereas RE5 AI was practically identical - and RE6 was different only in melee moves and equipped weapons. Here, you have the souped up antagonist (Barry/Claire) tagging alongside a support (Natalia/Moira), who focus on item-finding abilities as well as means of hindering enemies in their own unique ways - and can fight back in a pinch, if they have to.\n\nThis will open up the puzzle-element, which is kept simple and informative via the first episode.\n\nOne thing Capcom always delivers on with RE titles is an impressive bestiary - with brand new enemies joining a very large list of returning enemies (raid mode, mostly) from games as far back as Resident Evil 1, so you won't suffer a lack of vicious, disgusting, fleshy villians and familiar faces.\n\nOnce you get through the short Episode (available in three difficulties), you can work on unlocking addition modes - such as Campaign Time-Attack, Invisible Mode -- and, of course, Raid Mode, which is already addictive fun but will become more-so once online Co-Op is released in the future. There are also a host of hidden goodies strewn about campaign, from emblems (like RE4), bugs, and symbols, giving you a reason to investigate every nook and cranny during your adventure.\n\nUltimately - RE-RE2 is highly flawed - but can (and will) improve with time to go from being a decent game to, at the very minimum, a good one.","February 27, 2015","true","214.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As we can all agree that 5 and 6 was more action than actual horror. Resident Evil Revelations 2 has once again got my heart pounding and my brain scared, the switch between players is a good concept as each character has different abilities and its not just there for the sake of being there, the amount of ammo is enough so then I'm not knifing everything but low enough for me to be worried, traps, infected and jump scares are all brilliant. However puzzles can either be predictable or are unclear to what they want the player to do. Overall though, definitely a step up from the last realises and has brought it back to the genre that bad it a good series in the first place, although they do need to sort out the co-op feature.\n\nOverall I would rate it (excluding there being no Co-op and focusing on the single player) 7/10","February 27, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I've played through and beaten it and am running a moderate system (AMD FX-4130 3.8 GHz processor, 8 Gigs of Ram, Nvidia GTX 650), and there is some framerate slowage in certain areas (namely at the very beginning of the game, which seems to be all some of these people have actually played through).  However, I really never had framerate droppage around enemies so it never effected my gameplay.  My best guess is that there are certain moments in this game where it's initializing a lot of data and those are the spots where there's framerate droppage.  It is annoying when those moments occur, but this game is completely playable.\n\nThis is a fun resident evil so I would recommend it, especially at it's low price, but it's not a great, cannonical-style resident evil.  It doesn't feel completely 100% console, it feels a bit like a handheld game.  It's fairly low-poly, the environments aren't as cool as many resident evils, and it's got forced NPC characters that accompany you completely along the way (something people complained about in RE5).  These forced NPCs don't really add much to the game, they have the ability to see things in the environments that the "main" character can't, so instead of looking forward to using a different character, I felt obliged to do so just to find items in my environment, even if that's not really the case.  I understand why capcom did this though.  This is a series that was once criticized for keeping very similar gameplay for a long time and not "innovating", something that Capcom has obviously taken to heart.\n\nSo, these things do keep this from being a great resident evil, but it's definitely not bad.  It's still classic, fun, cheesy resident evil gameplay, and if you're a RE fan, there's nothing wrong with that.  It feels a lot like the first revelations, and overall, it's worth the price they're asking for it.  If you're one of those people who are seriously going to throw a hissy-fit over them forgetting to mention that there's currently not local split-screen co-op on this $6 game, don't buy it.  Instead go back to doing whatever it is that makes you happy(obviously complaining).

Which is disappointing. I would at this moment change my recommendation to a "NO". But I'll just I rewrite this review when all the episodes are released and I got an complete overview of the entire product. So keep that in if you wanna read my review of "episode 1". Cheers!\n\nOld review:\n\nResident Evil has always been a sort of guilty pleasure for me after Resident Evil 4, and after the less enjoyable Resident Evil 5 & 6 it feels nice that Revelations 2 is going back to a more calmer narrative and a more creepy atmosphere. (Have not played Revelations 1 so can't compare to it.)\n\nI enjoyed the combat a lot in this game. I played on hardest difficulty which made it hard but fair. Although if you're not familiar with the combat in previous games I would say go for normal.  Switching between guns and melee attacks is smooth and as intensive at it should be. And with a decent amount of variations to the enemy all the action scenarios feelt intensive and creative the entire first episode.\n\nThe controls are decent, it's clearly designed for a controller, but works good enough with mouse and keyboard.\n\nNot really much to say about the story within the first episode, but I really liked the setting and Barrys and Natalias part of the game has some enjoyable dialogs. Clearly the best part of  the plot so far. And as I said, I liked that the narrative is much slower compared to the newer Resident Evil games and it doesn't try to give a bunch of details of what happened in the previous games. So far you can get into it without any experience with Resident Evil games.\n\nIt's just such a shame it's such a bad version of the game. I didn't encounter much issue with the frame during the main campaign and so that part was really enjoyable, and made me look forward to the next episode. But it really shows in raid mode when the game throws as many enemys as possible. At times the enemys would start move in slowmotion, and one snow level in raid mode was next to unplayable because the frame rate went from 60 to 7-10.\n\nThe graphics quality is so so, its some great design and the main campaign there are parts that looks really nice. But when they show you more larger open areas in raid mode it can become really butt-ugly.\n\nAnd the there is the absent of coop, which should be there.\n\nI really hope they fix the frame rate issues, because overall this was a step in the right direction for the franchise. It had a great atmosphere and gameplay, and I want to play the next episode. But if you have a nextgen consol, you might wanna buy this for that instead. And if you don't well, it is 7 euros/dollars, if you find the trailers appealing and can forgive it's issues than step right ahead and give it a shoot. Otherwise......Umm yeah, I kinda liked it.","February 27, 2015","true","21.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's okay, but heavly flawed both gameplay and story wise.\n\nFirst off, the graphics are subpar at best, nothing fancy, but graphics don't mean everything in gaming, well to me anyways, so I will let that slide.\n\nNow for the story, it is a very interesting and creepy story, but it doesn't allow much room to exand upon unfortunately, as for the characters, you have Claire Redfeild, Moria Burton for one half and Barry Burton and Natalia for the other and they both play pretty similar, but with some minor differences, which I will get to in a minute. First, Claire and Moria's half of the story is much better in my opinion simply because of the atmosphere, it's creepy, dark and you feel danger all around you, you don't get that or much of that from Barry and Natalia's half sadly, which contains mostly Barry and his overpowered weapons like his Magnum and Assualt Rifle you get at the very start and when you start, it's pretty much the ame enviroments as it's set in the after the events Clarie and Moria went through (Sorry for the spoiler if you haven't played it already). But overall the gameplay is where it's at right? Wrong. It is almost identical in the style of RE: Revelations and RE6, sloppy and most of the time really boring. The scenery can be nice for brief moments, but the audio is once again amazing for Resident Evil standards anyways, the voice acting? Meh.\n\nNow the story was okay at the start, but then it kind of throws a curve ball at some points where your scratching your head as to why am I here? Who is this person behid all of this? What happens with your braclet? Ahh yes, before I forget about it, the braclets... They seem to only have a subtle part in the overall story, meaning it has nothing to do with the story, it's mentioned about 4 - 5 times and that's pretty much it, no build-up with it and no answers, just never mentioned again. Isn't that nice?\n\nAnyways, the game is okay, but for Resident Evil standards, especially as of late, it's okay, but I would rather play Resident Evil 6 to be honest. That's right... I said it...

And Natalia, a little girl with a "special gift" to really help you survive the island.\n\nChapter 2 - We start to find some answers, new weapons and little more about the island and who lives on it. For me, 1st one was harder, but 2nd was not bad at all, And when you tought nothing is new, Natalia's gift saves you at a complete new way.\n\n11.2/10","March 2, 2015","true","154.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Game still stutters a little but is vastly more playable now - updating review.\n\nKeep the improvements coming!\n\n---------------------------\n\nThe game is a lot of fun... when it perfroms adequately. And half of the time it doesn't. There are some signs that the game at its current state is not acceptably optimized for the PC, even on high-end machines. Parts of the game would run smoothly on the highest settings, then all of the sudden goes into a frame-drop frenzy, rendering the game unplayable.\n\nI cannot recommend this game until there is a fix for the performance issues. Unpredictable frame rate drops, stuttering and the lags really takes away from the game experience. The game does show a lot of promise with the improvements on Revelations 1 and the raid mode put on steriods - if only we can play it properly.\n\nUnless you enjoy fighting a group of zombies at a stunning, seizure-inducing 10FPS, stay away - come back when there is a fix.","March 1, 2015","true","39.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A gamepad (mine's the logitech F310 - the wired one, so no interruptions on gameplay) has solved all of the issues of stuttering and sticking aim and all that garbage.  And the gamepad in question has nice smooth aim and responsive controls.  If you have a chance to test a gamepad out to fix the issue, I strongly recommend giving it a shot.","May 20, 2015","false","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Character development might have been nice, but I couldn't see it to judge fairly.  Enemies (because of the fps problem) literally materialized either from nowhere, or a minute after their sound were heard.  Really screwed with whatever enjoyment of the game I might have had.  The interface with the mouse and keyboard didn't quite sync up, making pulling or using a weapon detrimental to my health, lol.  I ended up returning it after an hour of "gameplay".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LL2125/recommended/287290/","LL2125","Dr.Larry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LL2125/","605 products in account","I really don't like this game. Not because it's bad but because it's so god damn boring with some really annoying controls and really annoying AI with cheap deaths and cheap encounters designed to kill you the first time you experience it. That and the fact each chapter is literally an hour to two hours long with half of each chapter being simple copy & paste levels.\n\n-==Minor spoilers==-\n\nOne of the first big "This is BS!" moments for me was in Episode 1 playing through it as Clare. Right near the end, at the end of the main zone in the chapter, there's a part where you literally have to know what you're doing to not die and you won't catch onto it in the five seconds the game allows you to pull it off to complete the part without dying. This is the part where you have to open a gate which triggers a hoard, pass through the gate, turn a lever and run back to turn a flamethrower turret around to face the entrance, cutting off the zombies. The design is so cheeky they clearly place a healing item in the far corner of the room in direct vision of where the objective is: The lever. The lever itself just looks like a dull, bland fixture. 90% of people will run straight to pick up the healing item and run past the lever to trigger the flame turret. If you're fast enough you'll catch the "E" flash as you near the lever but you literally have to hit the lever without error to get past the area without letting hulks in who will, in close quaters, ♥♥♥♥ you up.\n\nThe second "This is BS!" moment for me was in Episode 2 near the beginning where, yet again, a horde is triggered and you have zero idea what to do. This is when a boss appears in the little bar they set up. It turns out he's unkillable so you have to run around until a cinematic cuts in... A cinematic that stops you from controlling the character, can't be skipped and has about a 2second delay after it ends before it allows you to fully control your character again. Then you have to run and climb a ladder which is pretty straight forward except for the fact your companion AI is utterly stupid so if you do manage to get up the ladder the AI, Moira in most cases, will bit lagging way behind trying to get up the ladder and most likely getting herself killed which prompts you to go and rescue her or you fail and have to retry anyway. Then, while waiting for her to get up on the roof enemies climb up the ladder and spam jump attacks at you as Clare. You will die here on your first playthrough unless you've already died to it and know what to expect.\n\nThe third "This is BS!" moment for me was in Episode 2 near the end of the chapter when you finally catch up to Natalia. Shortly after you meet up with her a boss drops on your head. Literally. Not only that but the game continually spawns in mobs in sets of two as you fight this massive, fat blob that shoots out fireballs from it's magic urn. You also have very little ammo and very few items to use. This also happens in an area where there are hulks and other normal mobs roaming around so if you go past a certain point to trigger the boss without killing the other enemies(In a large open room) you are absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed, sir.\n\nAfter the third BS moment I wasn't mad, I wasn't angry. I was just bored, disappointed and put down the game happily. Up until this point everything was the same. Enemies only really jumped out at you in a lame attempt at jump scares, some enemies just stood there with their backs to you for obvious stealth kill scenarios(Which isn't actually explained to you until Episode 1 part 2 as Barry I might add!) and some played dead but mostly it was just predictible jump scares where enemies were hidden in corners or behind doors waiting to jump out or lying down on the ground in an obscure place... That or they just spawned in in areas you didn't have visbility on. Boring. The fact that most of the level design consists of linear corridors it just wasn't very engaging or at alll entertaining to play through.\n\nThen you have the repeated levels for each character playthroug(There's only two sides of the story: Clare and Barry's scenarios). Played through an episode as Clare? Enjoy it? Well you better have loved it because we're going to make you play through it again except as Barry but set six months later and slight alterations to the level with one or two minor areas unlocked to force you through. It's just boring. It wasn't cool to copy and paste entire levels in Dragon Age 2 and it certainly hasn't been cool since!\n\nCompanions also suck. There's very little reason to use them other than to be forced to use them to hunt for hidden items. And by hidden I mean items you can't see unless you hold your flashlight over them(Clare and Moira) or point your finger at them(Barry and Natalia). This is the soul purpose of companions: To find hidden items planted across the level -- items that could be placed ANYWHERE but are invisible until your companion flashes their light on it or points in it's direction. They do nothing when they aren't controller. They have lame abilities they never use unless you control them such as Moira's ability to "stun" and enemy by flashing a light in their eyes or Natalia's ability to detect enemies(Which is only used when you control her). Playing as Barry is boring because all you do is crouch and play as Natalia then wait to see an enemy appear with her monster vision, switch to Barry and either stealth kill it(Crouch behind it and knife it for an instakill) or shoot it from a distance.\n\nIt's just not very fun. It's just a very boring game to play complemented with cheap scenarios that are designed to flat out kill you without a chance to beat it the first time you encounter them.","October 30, 2015","false","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You won't even enjoy every bit unless you unlock the game. I played the episode one, and just like every RE fan I enjoyed it. The things is, the mechanics are good and the game itself is a very nice port but the way they presented the game towards the PC is absolute cash grab.\n\nObjectives are obvious to do, with no little challenge as compared to old RE titles (PS1 Director's Cut was harder, and even then bullets were as scarce as ♥♥♥♥) and you can pick up obviously convenient items along the way. You can't even die from getting mauled by an axe-wielding infected (and I'm already playing on the hardest difficulty of the game)\n\nThe storyline is rich and I can see that CAPCOM gave it a very, very surprisingly (and pretty obvious) twist. But I find the lack of environmental interaction and how your choices matter in the game is somewhat plunged into a canal of disappoint since you only get to do objectives towards the pace the game has to offer.\n\nUnless you want to spend a few bucks to find some obvious jumpscares and get to see a Jill Sandwhich go ahead. But I recommend getting other full Resident Evil Games instead of being lured to a episode-based cash grab sequel.","December 29, 2015","false","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Why should I pay money on a game that falsely advertises itself as a CO-OP game. I have completely lost all respect I had for steam. The game states that it is a "multiplayer game" that is obviously for raid mode and "local CO-OP" and "online CO-OP".  in this they are implying that the "multiplayer" is for the raid mode and the "CO-OP'S" are for the story, furthermore why create a game that has an AI companion that cannot be controlled by a friend/companion? Especially because almost all the previous games had CO-OP story.

First problem, the frame rate is screwy, no matter what you set your own to, the game will not work properly.  I could HEAR the entire opening scene, but I couldn't see it.  Character development might have been nice, but I couldn't see it to judge fairly.  Enemies (because of the fps problem) literally materialized either from nowhere, or a minute after their sound were heard.  Really screwed with whatever enjoyment of the game I might have had.  The interface with the mouse and keyboard didn't quite sync up, making pulling or using a weapon detrimental to my health, lol.  I ended up returning it after an hour of "gameplay".  Thats in quotes because most of the time I was on pause, trying to figure out or reconfigure the controls so I could play.","November 28, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/recommended/287290/","scrubsauce","Scrubsauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/","394 products in account","(This review only covers the four main episodes of the game, and not the two bonus episodes that slot in between those chronologically.)\nI was too young to get involved with the Resident Evil franchise at its inception on the original PlayStation, and have only ever engaged in the franchise via Resident Evil 5.  My girlfriend is a huge fan of the movies and games however, and picked this up for us to play on the Steam Link in the living room together, so I figured I'd give it a whirl.  The original game was released episodically, so a base purchase will get you just Episode 1, and you can purchase each additional episode (a total of 4, plus 2 "extras" that are more side stories than the rest) or pick everything up in a bundle like she did.  Its interesting as a gamer to see the episodic model slowly coming back into style after the model kind of petered out in the 00's with Half-Life and SiN.  Early Access games can take the model to the extreme end of things, while developers like Tell Tale, and in this case, Capcom, can push out an entire campaign over the course of a year.  Now that the full game is available though, you won't have to worry about only getting the first taste and being left hanging for X amount of months.\nResident Evil 5, while enjoyable, didn't overly inspire me to go out and play every other title in the series I could get my hands on, although I will admit Resident Evil 4 continues to rot in the depths of my Steam backlog, so SOMEDAY I'll get to see what all the fuss is about there.  Revelations 2 was a lot more pallatable in terms of pacing though, and did not burn me out or get frustrating after long sessions of gameplay like some games do (especially when played on the TV, never been able to handle console marathons for anywhere near as long as on a monitor on a desk somewhere).  The gameplay balances itself between desperate "don't let the boogie man get me" gunplay and some puzzles that can range from basic to quite clever without being overtly infuriating, with dramatic pre-rendered cut scenes peppered in as bookends between it all.  I actually quite enjoyed the episodic nature as it put the game in nice bite-sized chunks I could sink my teeth into and feel satisfied with putting down the controller after a couple hours of gameplay until the next night.\nThe game puts you in control of two protagonists at a time that you can switch between at-will like other RE titles, but there are two duos in the story, each exploring the same maps separated by several months of time.  Each of the four characters has their own unique abilities and ways of working together with their respective partners to explore the maps, unlock doors, find ammo, etc.  Typically, one pair plays through an area for about an hour or two of gameplay, and then the story will jump to the second pair revisiting the same area, but possibly from a different angle, which made focusing on combat and puzzles for the second pair a lot more enjoyable as I knew where I was going, though sometimes the areas visited are dramatically different to prevent you from getting that feeling of retracing your steps every two  hours.  Ammo and inventory management is still a thing, you'll have to be choosy with how you engage enemies (especially when half of the playable teams do not pack heat), though boss battles tend to get a little more generous with keeping you adequatly stocked in case if you run out.\nBetween Resident Evil 5 and reading about the older games in the series in gaming magazines growing up, I was able to piece together enough of the story to make it enjoyable.  However, a lot of the finer details are relegated to journal-like collectables, and if you try to over-analyze the plot in the universe proper it might make for a headache for a casual fan.  Thankfully, the writing and overall themes of the game focus a lot more on this being a story about the four characters involved as people, rather than a piece of the giant Umbrella tapestry that Capcom has woven over the years, and for that the story comes out much more tolerable than other sketchy dubs of Japanese titles.\nI did experience some technical difficulties with massive frame drops and skipping in early gameplay, and have seen people having issues with it.  The final fix turned out to be V-sync related, and though I had it disabled in game, I still had G-sync enabled on my monitor and it was causing issues when played on PC or streamed to the Steam Link.  Disabling G-sync before playing eliminated all of my technical woes and the rest of the game ran fine, so I won't hold it against the developers.\nThough the game didn't completely convert me into a huge Resident Evil fan, Revelations 2 might have actually made me more willing to try other titles in the series like the stream of HD re-releases Capcom have been publishing.  Who knows, I might even finally get around to playing Resident Evil 4 HD.","April 10","true","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But the game handles solid, the controls are tight and Raid Mode is a blast.

There is about 2 hours of story gameplay in this first episode. You also get to play as Barry, which is great! There are some funny references to RE1.\n\nThe graphics feel rather dated.

I reach the area where u get your first gun...and this was the worst, such simple areas with some blood and guts on the floor causes my s*** to freak out and freeze almost constantly. the very first encounter was ruined because of this. I was not enjoying the game at all. I was fighting the game for how it played rather then caring about what was actually going on in the game. after that it got a tiny bit better. but this is just unacceptable. I will NOT return to the story again if the games optimization is not fixed. imagine trying to go through invisible enemy mode with constant stutters and freezes. its unfair, frustrating, and not fun.\n\nRaid Mode as I said before has crashed for a lot of people or has had people stuck on uploading results. this has not happened for me at all so far and I have beaten pretty much every mission there is with a level 43 Hunk that I have as of this review. but of course I had my settings on the lowest ones possible and on a resolution of 1240x768 (something like that) and most stuff in the levels is blurred out obviously and still runs like garbage. I really do enjoy playing the game when it does work somewhat decently. but this is not the way I should be experiencing the game. neither should anyone else go through this.\n\nI prey that this gets patched so nobody has to go through the trouble like many others have and to get a well optimized and fun experience from this game. which is what it should be. but as of now it is NOT worth a purchase since it is near unplayable.","February 26, 2015","false","149.0"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","9","20","3","5"

I'm running an X4 860k paired up with a 750ti. It's really not that bad, I can usually keep 60fps running at max. I don't think the issue deserves a negative rating as I'm sure it will get patched sooner or later (optimistic). Edit: It's fixed.\n\nThe game itself is solid. However, coming from the prespective of someone who played RE6 a lot, the mechanics are a step down. I'm not sure if it's the game or just the port, but the controls seem a little rigid, especially the running and aiming. It has nuances that you have to keep in mind. Specifically, while your character is in a sprint, you have to only press forward and change direction with the mouse. If you try to move left or right with the keyboard, it will shift the camera in that direction. This wouldn't be a problem normally, but the speed it changes the view is too fast. It's minor, but having the reverse controls would have made more sense (ala RE6).\n\nThe story is typical. It has a much more "horror" feel (still not very scary, but it does get tense). The first episode is laughably short. Anybody can go through it in 3 hours at most. It almost felt like a tutorial. I'm really hoping the next episodes will be much longer.\n\nPartner switching is back! This is the best addition, in my opinion I feel like this is neglected a lot. Claire gets Moira while Barry gets Natalia. Moira initially gets to use the flashlight which can stun enemies which allows you to either melee them, or switch to Claire to follow up with a ranged attack, you can then switch again to keep stunning the enemy. Switching back and forth is very fun, and finding ways to circumvent enemies with both characters is satisfying. Barry's Natalia takes more planning as she can throw a brick once before having to retreive another. This makes sense as the enemies you encounter in Barry's story are slower while they are faster in Claire's. This great design in play, and Capcom is not getting any recognition for it.\n\nRaid mode, what can I say. It's fun. It's no mercenaries, though. Progress by beating missions and upgrade your skills and weapons. I'm not a fan of the weapon upgrade system, a lot of the time it feels like RNG, but at least you're never totally underpowered and having to keep up with new weapons does mix things up a bit.\n\nI recommend the game to the Resident Evil fans. For everyone else, please know what you are getting. A solid game with a few hiccups. It's not broken like some others are making it out to be.","February 27, 2015","true","45.5"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

The weekly episodes is something I'm new to, never got to play Telltale's Walking Dead series. So, I think it's pretty cool, because not only do I have an extended value of the game, it's Raid mode has more replay value than expected. Having the game released in episodes, at the price of $6, seems justifiable. The online store is only there if I want to actually spend more money on the game, entirely up to my decision. I'm never reminded of the online store anywhere in the game, aside from opening the in-game store and the red crystal icon, which is so small its not even annoying.\n\nThe game does have its far share of problems though, one being the dropping of frame rate in certain areas of the campaign and on certain maps of raid mode that I guess require a lot of rendering. It confuses and irrates me particularly because, for me personally, similar maps on different difficulties will drop frame rate dramatically. My laptop can handle other games at max settings with ease, so this is a problem the developers will need to fix for the community, and I'm sure they will because they are releasing weekly and bugs/problems show up regardless of any game.\n\nIf you can get past the rough edges of this game, then I hope you'll enjoy it, because I enjoy it immensly for what it is and I'm excited to see what happens in the following weeks of the game.","February 28, 2015","true","114.1"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Now i first notice peoples been talking about FPS drops a lot, but i myself have not had any problems with the game at all.\n\nGood Graphics: They seem to have done a mixture of old style resident evil and new style wich i really enjoy seeing, plus this game is not like the first revelations wich was made for Nintendo 3Ds, so the graphical detail is quite good.\nGame Runs Smoothly: Im using MSI GTX 970 Gaming 4g, i5-4440 Processor, 12gig Ram, Windows 8.1 (No FPS drops at all, smooth all the way)\nMultiplayer/Co-Op: This is one of the reasons peoples are buying this game, if you have a friend or mate you often play with this should be a game to look for.\nFor 25€ this game is nicely priced: Im not sure why they decided to ask so less from a brand new game, but the game really seems to be worth for the money.\nOnly negative i could find about the game so far is that its being released in Episodes? this isint exactly any new concept due many games have done this but for a resident evil game i find it quite odd, but... if you can look past it, the game is surely a good one to consider buying.","February 25, 2015","true","25.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stainlesssteele4/recommended/287290/","Stainlesssteele4","Stainless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stainlesssteele4/","340 products in account","Resident Evil is always a tough sell. It's reached the point where not many would find enjoyment in these games save for those invested in the series.\nHere we stand on a unique beast. A PC port of a sequel to a spin off series that started on a handheld, and yet oft touted as the 'return to roots' we've always desired.\n\nDo I enjoy Resident Evil Revelations 2? Yes, quite throughly in fact. But Capcom has seemingly gone out of their way this time to ensure that I wouldn't.\n\nFor starters: The game is nearly unplayable with a mouse and keyboard. Even at the lowest camera and aiming sensativity settings, the mouse driven camera is an unwieldly beast. Dashing with keyboard controls is fine, until making any form of turn, at which point the camera spins wildly. Some animations do not play nice with keyboard bindings, and its quite curious as to why. Especially considering: None of these issues are present when using a controller. Unfortunately, this is the only method of play I can tolerate given the mouse and keyboard issues, and having purchased the game on PC with hopes of using my prefered method of input, I am certainly disapointed.\n\nI suppose I could throw in my two cents about the offline co-op debacle as well: I don't care in the slightest. Modders have patched it in, and there are clearly some issues, so one can understand why the feature was axed. Moreover, I have no idea under what circumstances I would be playing a game split screen on my PC. I've yet to play the game cooperatively online either, but given the mechanics, I don't see the game being very enjoyable if one player is nigh defenceless. The character swapping works quite well solo, and I think I'll leave it that way.\n\nSome other notes: The game is pretty great looking. Environment textures are a bit on the lacking side, but character models look great when the game is cranked. Shooting (with a controller) is pretty responsive, and feels like a step up from Revelations 1.\n\nSo, can I recommend Resident Evil Revelations 2? I suppose I could, with a few added stipulations: If you're a fan of the series (or at the very least, the previous game), and you don't mind using a controller, then sure, there's some fun to be had here, especially considering the low price.","March 1, 2015","true","4.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"
