At this moment in time there's an enormous amount of content in the game - to the point where I'm still learning tactics, combos and overall simply how to be better at the game. For an early access game this is actually pretty impressive.\n\nThe combat in this game is really satisfying, getting kills is pretty damn fun! The only real gripe I have is that there's only one death animation where they just fall onto their knees and die... This is kind of boring to be honest but it is in alpha so I'll say this as constructive criticism - add in instagibs for overkills and various different death animations based on which class you use and that'll make the game much more responsive and make each class more unique.\n\nOn the topic of classes; they're all kind of similar to be honest, the Fire, Lightning and Frost all have the same first ability which is basically a close range, consistent attack which is kind of the same really but I expect that will change as the game is developed on more. The Arcane, Nature and Earth are more unique but overall they all share very similar traits which is kind of a shame really. I would like to see more status effects because at the moment there's pretty much only the slowing effect from frost.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential though, just by making the classes more unique and different adding in more play-styles it can really turn this game into something great. Then just by copying the structure of a lot of competitive games we have now such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with a functioning matchmaking system, leader-boards and ranks and there you have it! A fully functional competitive game.\n\nThe graphics are not great though, and by not great I mean 2004 Unreal Tournament Mod. They're bad and way too dark. It is alpha at the moment so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and in defence for the developers the most recent update did make a lot of the spells look better.\n\nSpeaking of developers, these guys are great, every weekend they schedule play-tests - and in fact I played with them the other day (Saturday). They read the forums and respond to everything. They're pretty good guys and equally they're pretty damn good at the game too...\n\nOverall this game is pretty fun, I'll be keeping tabs on this game and on the upcoming updates.\n\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","April 5, 2015","true","5.3"," 85 of 108 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","85","108","6","10"

The style is reminiscent of the old school arena action of yore. The days of Quake and Doom echo through the very core of Grimoire: Manastorm, while modern MOBA-styled elements breath new life into it and entangle with Elder Scrolls-esque lore and powerful firey doom.\n\nThe central gameplay is entertaining and intense; overpowered wizards struggle in the streets of dingy cities and classic fantasy locales. Unlike the usual first person shooter, you trade in your pistols, shotguns, and rifles for Lightning, Netherworld Magic, and Flames.\n\nYour characters burn, squash, and electrocute eachother to take glowing control points throughout the maps during Conquest, a tense and action-packed team play mode. The team-based combat already feels tight, and the use of tactics can turn the tide of the battle. A single fire wizard moving around the side and flanking the unsuspecting defenders with the use of their Ultimate ability followed by a flurry of fireballs can entirely change the flow of combat.\n\nOn the other side of the coin you might find Free-For-All a frustrating mess, or a great source of fun. FFA is chaotic, even by the standards of the Conquest mode. During an FFA match you will often find yourself wandering for a moment before becoming embroiled in the magical hell-storm unfolding in the center of the map. There's little breathing room and most of the time you'll find yourself flailing helplessly in the fray before being cut down by a lucky shot from someone hopping into the fight with full health just after respawning. Speaking of respawning... The spawnpoint system that is implemented in FFA leaves much to be desired. There have been numerous occasions where I literally spawn inside of another player, or someone spawns directly behind me.\n\nGrimoire's initial offering might turn some away. The first match is so absolutely confusing that it feels like you've just been dropped face-first into a malfunctioning nuclear reactor and told to stop it from meltingdown. Okay, that might have been a bit of an exaggeration, but my point still stands that the first match or two might be so off-putting that you'll turn your nose up at it. The controls are a little hard to get used to, but my main suggestion would be to change the controls to FPS in the options menu. This style, I feel, should be the default as it is much easier to use and much more intuitive. Give it a few matches and tool with keybindings before giving up if you find your first match a bit too insane.\n\nThe game's graphics also leave something to be desired. The assets used for effects and the magical graphics are certainly fun to watch, featuring a uniquely stylized and fun look, but character models are rather flat. Textures tend to be muddy, and the ground in some areas looks like it was pulled straight from the Playstation 2. However, this is certainly excusable at the moment because you can already see what the developers are going for, and what they hope to one day achieve. However, the graphics aren't so bad that it makes it hard to play, and the gameplay is fun enough to make the visuals often fade into the background.\n\nAs it stands, the game is a highly playable and fun romp through chaotic medieval landscapes. While the graphics leave much to be desired, and more gamemodes would be appreciated, the current offerings are enough to provide a good deal of entertainment for the tidy little price of 10 USD (or for free if you got your key from PC Gamer's giveaway). I have only high expectations for the future of this game, and look forward to seeing it improve and to take part in it. For now, I've spent enough time writing out this review, I think it's high time that I put my pointy hat back on and start slinging spells in the courtyard. I hope to see you folks on the field.

Having full team mage battles is incredible as there are no mana costs on spells so ice winds and fire storms are just flying everywhere while you dodge and weave around the back and steal the control points.\n\nYeah the look of the game currently isn't anything to bust a nut over yet, but i've honestly not had this much fun in an online FPS in ages. Looking very much forward to what the game will look like out of early access, so i'ma buy this tasty gem and hope others do too as i want more massive mage throwdowns.\n\nJust please change the hands in first person, they are flopping all over the place, and also add different spell effects that appear in the right hand as i need that visual feedback to know what spell i've got selected.

Utility spells allow you to alternate the play style of the class you pick, giving the game an 'Easy to pick up, Hard to master' vibe to it. Meaning that skill has a big part to play, 'Mind games' and strategy with teleport and mana dashing, even a well timed Stoneskin during your opponents ultimate or other large cooldowns can win you a fight with ease.\n\nI'd give it an 8/10 (bear in mind this review is while it's still in Alpha testing)\nI'd only give it an 8/10 due to the few bugs which are to be expected, but also to the seeming lack of community which I'm sure can only grow with time. This game is run by a small group of indie devs 5 or 6 in total I believe, not to mention the fact they have just lost their lead programmer a few weeks ago. Although he wasn't their only programmer it will obviously damage the development of the game drastically, in addition losing a member in such a small group of devs also makes a huge difference to progress.\n\nThis game has so much potential, it will take time to get there but when it does I'm certain this will be a masterpice to behold.","August 2, 2015","true","27.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

You won’t be sprinting across the battlefield, you can’t even crouch due to your elderly wizard knees. Your only weapon will be your bare hands and the element of your choice. Destroy your foes with fire, lightning, or even the power of the nether. Currently there are 6 classes, each offering their own unique playstyle. While some class roles are fairly obvious, like nature wizards having the ability to heal, the actual execution is entirely up to you. Tweaking your playstyle is made even easier by allowing you to pick your own “utility” and “mobility” spells. Feel like blasting your enemies from a rooftop? Use a mobility teleport to get on the roof and rain destruction down. Playing a long-range class, but not great at aiming? Use a utility binding spell to keep your enemies still for a second. The action is fast-paced and based on completely on skill. It’s early access, but the potential is there. Here it comes, Grimoire- Manastorm!\n\nThe spell effects are pretty great, especially viewed from third-person. In first person some of them are a bit lackluster, but that is to be expected during early access. The character models look nice, as do the levels. There are control point and team deathmatch game modes available. It’s a pretty awesome feeling, watching two teams of wizards slinging spells at each other. Spells move at different speeds, but most are able to be dodged with some quick reflexes. You are able to use a blink called “mana-step” to traverse ground quickly. Mana-step is the only skill that seems to use mana, which means you can sling all the spells you please. Not worrying about mana makes the combat much more frantic, as neither wizard will generally ever stop casting during combat. Blinking behind a cart to dodge an icebolt and returning fire with your own spell school is intense, and with a full server the action is constant.\n\nThere doesn’t seem to be any damage multipliers based on elemental strengths and weaknesses, a la Pokemon, but I think it would be a nice addition to strengthen the class-based gameplay. The classes seem to still require some tweaking and balancing. My roommate and I both found ice to be extremely overpowering to almost any other class. Ice is a relatively close-range class, so picking lightning and striking from afar seems to castrate your opponent relatively well. Aiming better than your opponent is really less than half of the battle. Knowing which spells your opponents are likely to use, and how to counter them is what will end up winning wars. Thinking on your feet, and using wits along with clever use of spells is exactly what being a mage is all about, and to see it come to life in such a fantastic way is something to behold. However, it is still early access, so there are a couple of blemishes.\n\nThe biggest obstacle the game will need to overcome is a loyal player-base. There are dev playtests 3 times weekly, which makes it relatively easy to get the full experience but in off-hours most matches you find will be 1v1. I would like to see a free-for-all deathmatch mode, since the occasional 2v1 isn’t really a fun experience. There is also currently no music aside from the main menu, though that music is quite epic and mythical. I would also like to see a bit more variety in the levels, and to have the first-person spell effects be kicked up a notch. There is time for all of the above to be fully fleshed out, and if you can find a decent match, what is offered is amazingly fun. I suggest it to anyone who enjoys a real time battle of wits and reflexes whilst slinging a bevy of spells at your opponent. Thanks to Omniconnection for the review copy. Here’s to hoping Grimoire- Manastorm will blossom into what it deserves to be.\n\nSummary: Amazing magic-based FPS with 6 classes and endless playstyles.\nFinal Score: 6/10 for gameplay, models, and spell effects.\n\nThis is an Early Access review to be updated on full release.\nFull text/photo Early Access review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-grimoire-manastorm-early-access/\nVideo Early Access review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EzT3eT2LB8","February 14, 2015","true","2.6"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","13","19","7","1"

It is thrilling to battle others using different styles depending on what class you are playing. There are 6 classes so far (Earth, Ice, Fire, Nature, Nether, and Lightning), each with their 4 unique spells. Even though learning the controls were hard for me when I started playing the game, but after two or three matches, I got a grasp of the game and started murdering my enemies. Grimoire is defnitely a game for anyone that loves multiplayer FPS games or even just a someone who likes playing fantasy RPG game.","February 12, 2015","true","3.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

If you're unfamilliar with what that means, that means that it's not feature complete and a little rough around the edges. However, the structure is solid and the class structure is fantastic. The mage classes are all themed well and a blast to play--the interactions and gameplay between all their skills has quite a bit of depth, if you take the time to learn how they work properly. Each duel between rival mages feels different, and losing isn't frustrating because you can always think of something you could have done better.\n\nAs an added bonus, a group of friends and I were playing and ended up playing with the level designer and talking with him on voicechat while we murdered each other with fireballs. He was super cool and down-to earth. He took our feedback, and talked to us about the future direction for the game, which sounded awesome.\n\nI don't normally do Early Access anymore, but this is one to make an exception for. If you don't feel like buying it, at least keep it on your list of games to check out again when it's closer to done--there's a lot to be excited for in this.","April 26, 2015","true","8.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

The game does need a lot of work. I think the mages have  good variance in abilities and appearance and I like the atmosphere of the map  and game in general. I did crash a few times but I expect that from an alpha.  I think overall a few of the things that need improved the most are probably the combat, and the graphics. Combat wise everything seems to be there and functioning, the biggest negative I have noticed is you just dont feel it. There needs to be some way to make the combat feel more "combaty" and less floaty.  Make the hits count.\n\nAs it stands that's by far my biggest complaint. I think the game could definitely use better assets, or "graphics". Unless they are specifically going for an art style that's this old I dont see a reason why they should not put the extra effort in, after all the rest of the game seems nice. if the managed to keep the stlye but make the textures look like a more modern game I think it would do wonders for it.\n\nI had never heard of this game before the free weekend, but we need more games like it.

Let's face it, the only reason you know about a lot of the game you are playing right now is because people like us play them and tell you whether they are good or not. The huge flood of Early Access games to hit Steam, and some of the developers bailing on their projects don't help matters at all.\n\nSo I guess the question to ask is whether Grimoire: Manastorm is a good game, or do we watch it crash and burn? In its current state I would say that it definitely has potential to be a great multiplayer game. Although the game does barrow from the competitive multiplayer games that came before it, I feel it does a great job of setting itself apart through the combat system. It does follow the standard first person view and arena style map, but it relies on spells instead of guns. This is actually one of the games features that gives it some originality, and makes it a lot of fun. During the course of a match you are attempting to out score the other team via capture points on the map. The guys developing the game didn't invent this style of play but they adapted it to fit their game pretty well.\n\nWhen it comes to killing the opposing team you definitely have choices. When you start up a match you can choose between Earth, Lightning, Ice, Fire, Nature and Nether for your class. You also have some options for utility and travel spells which help augment our play style. These include spells like Teleport, Repel, Stoneskin, Arcane Barrier, etc. Although each class has the same basic attacks to deal damage they feel very different when you start unleashing the more powerful spells. You can tell when playing each class that later on each one will have a role in a team composition. Since each class has a different set of powerful abilities team composition will become important when playing, like in every other multiplier game.\n\nSo is the game worth it? For the huge sum of $13.00, yes, it is worth it. I have spent $50.00 on a game and completely regretted ever loading it up. In the case of Grimoire, it only lacks people to play with. Like every other multiplayer game it requires people to play against each other to be fun. Given some time to polish and balance the game, we could easily see this being a great game that many people will be playing in the future.","February 24, 2015","true","4.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I feel that the more I played the more I understood that this game takes skill at times, and when a player suceeds in a skillful move it feels insanely rewarding.\n\n***IMPORTANT***\nThe developers are soon moving to a Free to Play formula for this game so if anyone is reading the review at the time of this game being free.

THE POINT IS! and this is simple, this game was completely worth the wait, I mean, the lack of tutorial, the shoddy old school graphics, and the lagginess that comes from playing on a server no where near australia, reminded me of my old gaming days when I was younger, it's not hard to jump in, check out the controls, they are really simple, and you can choose between two setups, an FPS - choose your weapon/spell style of setup where you have each spell to flick through from numbers 1 to 4 or you can have the quick shot setup which puts each of the 4 spells in a conveniant place near your fingers, you won't find yourself reaching out of the way to hit a spell button from across the keyboard, even the dash or "manawalk" or whatever its been called, is conventiently placed, it also comes in handy for parkouring to places on the map, I found my self jumping from one balcony to another using it, a versatile skill which just adds to the awesome gameplay, this game isn't perfect but it looks like the devs are doing their best to slowly iron out the wrinkles and deflea it from the bugs, classes seem to be well balanced, although I only played the earth class, simply because the drop mechanic on the boulders seemed interesting to me, I can't wait to see how this game progresses and I hope to whatever deity exists that this game becomes very popular, I will reccommend it to everybody i can. what else is there? umm... well this would be an easy game to use with a controller setup, and umm... well theres nothing else, once the devs smooth out the gameplay, thin the hit boxes for some of the abilities, like the Earth ultimate (I kept hitting a lampost or a roof or something when I specifically aimed for total annihlation of a single person) anyways, for an alpha, this is an awesome game. yes, yes yes.

Awesome! Even though I'm not a fan of this genre, I still managed to enjoy this game on a major level! This game proves that not all developers are greedy-♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that need some quick cash.\nAlready from the start you get about 6-8 classes (don't judge me, I didn't focus on counting lel), and a ♥♥♥♥ ton of unique powers for each and every one of them. All of the classes have common powers like teleportation.\nUsing the shift button is a must at most dangerous situations.\nThe graphics could be better, but since the gameplay is awesome, you shouldn't really mind it...\nThe only flaw that I find pretty much attention-taking is the overpoweredness (if I could say that) of the fire class.\nOverall, an awesome game!

Each utilizes it's own style with 4 personal attack and a passive. You then have a choice between 2 utility perks that all share and complete the skillset. Using that, your team of 5  will attempt to take over the most control points while gaining them for kils as well\n\nTo my feelings after I played them, this is how each felt to me, of course basing it off how much the damage output and range was:\n\nFire: Feels like your all aout assault class\nIce: Gives you more crowd control\nLightning: Feels more like your long range damage\nEarth: Defensive\nNether:  AoE based, good for controlling ground\nNature: Healer with AoE style\n\nPros:\nRuns great for a 2 month old Alpha\nClasses diverse enough\nMultipul maps\nNot alot of downtime\nNo class levels\nStreamlined setup selection\n\nAreas to Improve:\n(Can't be called cons, this is a 2 month old EA Alpha)\nThe game is relatively new, Server list will most likely pick up as player base does. My only concern was no tutorial or documentation which can give you a fuzzy first 5 minutes, but this is something they can easily code in later. There is a Player Level that doesn't seem to be implimented in yet, but tracks basic skills. I can see where this could evolve into a perk, rune, or some otherwise named account wide personalized playstyle system.\n\nThe free play endded a bit ago, and it's on sale 50% off, under $8 at the moment, so definently picking this up to see where they bring this game too\n","April 26, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I had always been kind of passively searching for a good mage game where you could hopefully do some pvp or at least duel other players. I first saw Grimoire back when the free weekend happened. I was apprehensive about it at first because I didnt want to come across another gimpy-mages-doing-lame-tricks game, that would have discouraged me from mage games for a while. So I tried it and to my surprise it surpassed my expectations. It had 2 modes, FFA and Team Capture The Points. There was 6 highly diverse classes and selectable "Bonus Spells" Grimoire is a fast paced high intensity wizard game. My only complaint would be that player count day to day is not all there but that will be fixed soon and I would like class progression which is going to be added in coming updates.\nAnother plus is that the dev play tests actually help and they are really connected with the players.","February 17","true","12.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I really like what they've done with the earth school and all the classes really feel like their own. The fast paced  FPS action alone though makes this game a blast to play. It almost reminds me of Quake while at the same time reminding me of one of my all time favorite MMOs Darkfall. A lot of the spells feel really powerful and makes it that much sweeter when you crush someone with a boulder.\n\nNow, what I feel the game needs to work on.\n\n-Progression system\n\n-Some sort of personalization(not necessarily a char creator)\n\n-Active blocking. I would like to see a more active blocking system that prevents the use of spells, but allows you to mitigate incoming projectiles(not AOE or skills raining down on you). Currently the game leans heavily on just dps, which is great for a fps, but it takes away the feel of "battle of epic mages" vibe that this game is going for.\n\n-Siege game mode. You're a badass mage, so you don't need catapults, but having to burst open keep doors(while being attacked from high up) and surviving through chokepoints to take the relic inside would be fun.\n","April 26, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The community in this so far is quite small, but a very helpful and friendly one to play with. I had always wanted to play a mage/fps mutant-crossover and I feel with a little more development this will be a nice break from guns and bombs style fps that mainstream developers seem incapable of making otherwise. At the moment in early-access don't expect much in terms of holding your attention, but if it ever comes under $5 I would recommend giving it a go and hopefully the dev team listens to all our ideas for this games future.\n\n-Have fun!!!","May 23, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The way the combat feels at the moment is completely in sync with each element. Fire is devastating, dangerous and quick. Void is hit and miss, with a steady amount of damage. Ice is slow but reliable, and will freeze oponents. Lightning will be a quick suprise but doesn't hit too hard. Stone allows for durability while bleeding the enemy dry, and nature allows for a balance of utility and damage (plus the bonus of turning into a tiny squirrel-like-thing). The utility and defensive spells add just enough variety to keep the game from being the same few magic classes without making the number of spells too confusing.\n\nThe only downside is that it's not popular enough at the moment for a full game at 2 o'clock in the afternoon - also the void spell that grabs opponents sometimes flings them off the map... but I can live with that as long as I get to turn myself into a hurling mass of rock and crush six people to death.","July 7, 2015","true","10.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A mixed between skyrim destruction magic and some MMORPG where you can cast some big destructive AOE spells.\nChose one among the six type of mage (fire, ice, earth, lightning, life, nether) with 4 unique offensiv spells to each plus some extra capacities (teleportation, energy shield, trap...) to enhance your fighting, then go to the arena to fight alone or in a teambattle.\n\n\n\nThe concept is original, simple and fun:\nEach mage has a unique gameplay: Fire is powerfull but you need to get close to ennemies to attack efficiently; Ice is mostly a mid-close range AOE type; Earth is a close splash damage type; Lightning is the long range type...Of course all mages can attack at long or close range, but they have their pros and cons.\n\nContrary to most of the FPS, you don't need to find ammo, health or armor.\nThere is an auto heal, but  the regen rate is slow enough for not making you invincible during fights, and fast enough to recover if you manage to hide a moment.\nMage don't need bullets. However there is a cooldown for each spells. That's why you have to anticipate the ennemies moves and cast wisely in order to fight efficiently as the stronger is the spell the longer you have to wait.       "TIME IS MANA" -Blood Elf.\n\nWhat's more......................................The character control is easy and simple..............You don't need to crouch or crawl.\n\n\nThe game is still on alpha, the developper team is very small, but they are working hard to improve the game.

I cannot get this game.  But I want this game!\n\nForget Early Access!  The game is fun, playable, and needs to be finished so it can go on and further.\n\nIt has been said before that there is a nice, dynamic way to this shooter.  You know what, those sayings have been completely true.  I played for one night, got used to the Nature class, the others are just as good, and now I want this game.  Graphical quality is bad!  Negligible....As always for good games, especially the ancient classics! ; )  They actually have some nice aesthetics.  I stopped to check out a wizard's door and took notes on some other peculiarities, especially the hoods versus hats team match up.  There are different colored runes in the spawn rooms for the two colors of team.\n\nThe spells are wonderful in variety and controls.  There are quite a few classes actually to the game.  Yes there is skill and tactics to be had, especially if your team can work off of each other, but it is not too hard to do so.  Have had no encounter with a bad community, although they don't make a bad game. ; )\n\nOnce I was stuck in a box for the rest of a round when I was carrying, but we were going to lose anyway.   I have had teleported myself behind strange obstacles and gotten back.  There are holes graphically in the enviroment when I turned into a rabbit, but they don't effect you.  You really are faced with a pretty great game which should continue to be improved in terms of graphics, lag, and...\n\nI guess that's it.  Lag wasn't bad at all really.  Once or twice there was a very mild hit.  You may want to change your resolution to take care of any issue.  I did barely into it because I started to notice there would be some trouble.  But I played several good games and got into it really.  Its fun with mages! Get this for a Mage competition!  I will be back for this game!","April 24, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The core concepts are there, I can see them a mile away, the synergy of the spells is great, each "class" fits into their own niche very well and it is a very fun game to play, I imagine I will buy it and go back to it. However, I really want to see these improvements:\n\n- Each class being visually distinguishable (Ala TF2)\n- More visual effects, what I mean by that is knowing I have been hit by the nether pull spell before I go flying half way across the map\n- Implement some sort of GCD (Ala WoW) Some synergies are far too easy to pull off (Pull, trap, ground DoT = Kill)\n- Instead of a mana bar for your mage step, just have it on a 2 sec cooldown, or make said mana bar replenish faster.\n\nJust a couple of ideas. I really like the game, though it just seems like "a slower quake with magic" not that I am complaining however. Ultimately, I wish that there was a middle of the road option for my rating, because I feel that the problems listed above massively detract from gameplay, however, knowing that this is a early access game and the core concept is just that damn good, I am willing to recommend this game.","April 25, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/durato/recommended/335430/","durato","durato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/durato/","48 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTried while was free, my review is the following:\n\nI like it.\nThe game has 7 classes for magic elements (Nature, Void, Fire, etc.)\nFirst element I played was the Nature. It really fit my style that I can heal and damage at the same time (and escape as a rabbit :D ). Next element was the void (or what) which casts purple-black stuff. I didn't really get the idea...\n\nSo, the game works really well for a spellcasting (that's really weird at first) FPS. For controls, there are two main options: You may select spells with 1,2,3,4 keys and with a _second_ click, activate them. Seems nonsense to me, I can hardly imagine myself participating in a fast-paced combat using this setting. Because this game is fast-paced! I could jump in fairly easily, being useful to the team and shooting green stuff everywhere. Back to controls: the other option has four quick cast buttons: LMB, RMB, Q and E. Comfortable, feels like I already got used to it before.\n\nI have only played 15-30 minutes, so nothing deep, but here are pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n- nice graphics, style, mood and font set\n- the pre-set characters seem right to me\n- simple, fast gameplay\n- easily recognizable spells\n\nCONS:\n- I miss custumizable character spells. There should be two options for each slot (LMB, RMB, Q and E) maybe the ultimate spell shouldn't be selectable, but I hope you get it\n- I heard no music, or ambient sounds, that would be appreciated\n- Please, apply colors to wizard robes according to team color! Hard to decide who is enemy - okay, we have red name tags, but that's all...\n\nSummary:\n\nTRY IT!\nEspecially while it's free.\n\n+1 PRO: Unreal engine -> "DOUBLE KILL KILL KILL!" - really funny.","April 24, 2015","true","0.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArcSiel/recommended/335430/","ArcSiel","Siel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArcSiel/","303 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIn theory, Grimoire: Manastorm is an interesting idea - a multiplayer shooter with wizards and sorcerer taking the place of futuristic super soldiers. In practice, Grimoire: Manastorm is a low-budget, unpolished shooter that does nothing at all new\n\nMagic schools (of which there are a whopping six) act like a combination of class and weapon. You have frost railguns, fire missile launchers, wind plasma guns, and the like. They're extremely uninspired, and they pretty much are a 1:1 recreation of a couple of archetypal weapons and their secondary fires crammed into a single school of magic with four applications, except slower and with the interesting effects on a cooldown. You can occasionally rain meteors on an opponent, turn him into a rabbit or create an healing tree, but most of the time you'll be running around playing a bad reskin of a futuristic shooter. The effects are cheap, weak and really ugly to look at, and worst of all, they hardly feel like they even have any weight or power behind them at all.\n\nYou can also choose a random utility spell, which boils down mostly to various forms of defense, like placing down a very ugly looking shield or becoming temporarily harder to kill, and a mobility spell, like a teleport that literally pops you 1000 units forward with no real effect on your sight and a ping sound that feels like it should belong in a puzzle game, or a wind bolt that's basically a non-damaging clone of one of the Fire spells. They feel just as bland and uninteresting as the combat spells themselves.\n\nThe graphics are subpar even for indie games in this day and age and they lack any kind of charm or uniqueness. The setting is null and void, generic fantasy at its worst, and the sound design would be alright for a very bland puzzle game.\n\nThere's a free for all mode, and an objective mode that's every point capture mode ever made. Despite the game currently being free to play there's a grand total of 10 servers up, all of which are mostly populated by extremely stupid bots.\n\nit is currently a Early Access title, but considering the developers are tossing this out as a Free Weekend, I have a hunch they feel like it's getting close to release. In its current state, there's very little redeeming about Grimoire: Manastorm to latch on and have hopes for. At its best, it's generic and uninspired, at its worst, it's just plain bad. It needs a serious conceptual, technical and promotional overhaul for it to even be worth considering.","November 1, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Did I have some enjoyment when playing: A little, Would I recommend it to others: No.\n\n3/10\n\nThe Review:\n\nGrimoire: Manastorm is a Capture point style of online multiplayer game where players take on the roles of mages with varying elements of: Ice, Nature, Earth, Lightning, Fire and Nether.\n\nEach element of mage has a different set of 4 abilities with all but Nether also having a trait. For example Nature's trait: On death polymorph into a rabbit, if you survive the duration you will be resurrected on 50% health. The majority of the first spell/ability seem to be essentially be a beam/stream effect, whereas nether's is more of a boomerang and earth's is a shotgun.\n\nYou also have a movement ability and a utility ability, As the names suggests depending on the skills you pick these lend you an extra movement or utility ability. By default a short teleport and a spell barrier are active, but you can also pick from others such as timed movement speed increase, A delayed teleport, etc for movements. For utility you can also pick from others such as stoneskin, a trap, etc. There is a bug where unless you manually change them (picking the same as default fixes it) where the icons for the movement/utility abilities will have wrong icons.\n\nAs for the game itself it's just a rather generic feeling TDM/Capture Point game (I admit I didn't try TDM but I assume it exists), it's missing 'life' let alone a player base and this review is being written on a friday when it's on free weekend. The combat can feel rather 'empty' with an odd 'ring' as a hit marker sound and bugs on sounds when you take damage; sometimes there are just no hit sounds when you are taking damage.\n\nOverall I cannot recommend the game, It might be fun if you get it rather cheap in a bundle with 7 other friends or so and drink a few beers to just have some stupid fun. The game needs to be ironed out in areas and some more 'life' spruced to it somehow and maybe it would gain a player base but I presume it's already too late, which is rather sad as it's only in Alpha early access.","April 24, 2015","false","2.4"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

Starting with the fact that the matchmaking seems a bit too broken, not that it matters as the game seems to be almost completely empty. But after some waiting I have managed to find a server with someone on and then I saw why there seems to be no real community in this game. Its ♥♥♥♥ing boring. You get a variety of what I guess could be called classes who all have some extremely underwhelming spells that you are supposed to use to kill oponents, however there is no real impact from said spells. The effects in this game are extremely basic and other than a very basic cast noise, there is no real feeling of force in your powers. I played this game for a few minutes and I didn't see the point of playing anymore as there was simply no satisfaction for anything you do in this game.\n\nNow, I want to like it, I really do. I am all up for magic based games, but this is like playing Magicka with basic grunts being the only effect on each spell.","November 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The game is either entirely one-sided or not. In the like two minutes I played this, this is what I found.\n\n1) The one-sided nature comes down to the skill of both teams. If one team has more than one player in one area then the team with more players will have the higher chance of survival, especially if they are dark casters.\n\n2) The game starts in 1280x720. While this is nice for the larger 1080p or 720p monitors, my current monitor is a 1024x768. It's not my choice, I have to deal with it currently. It's not a gripe that it starts at this resolution, but the fact that I chose fullscreen and my native resolution made the game freeze. It wasn't anger inducing, it just froze. So I guess that's more of a bug report than anything.\n\n3) The movement and attacks are way too slow for what seems to be a fast-paced game. It's actually a little annoying, especially considering this is a Capture-The-Flag type game and it doesn't appear to have any real combat going on at any point in time.\n\nWhile these are my gripes, the game seems to be well made and can be a lot of fun with friends. The graphics look nice for the kind of game it is and it even has a "Low-End PC" option in the Graphics menu so even bad computers can run it.\n\nOverall I kind of wish this game was better designed so I give it a "No". But that shouldn't stop you from trying it, it seems like it could be a lot of fun if you took the time to get into it.","June 25, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I've gone onto this game many times just too see if there is anyone around, everytime it's the same, not a soul. Which is a shame really, I mean very few games deserve this end to their life, dying out as a game simply because you have no player base is rough.

The mages are diverse and even if some are op, no one is useless. Maybe just the nature one. Yeah nature is pretty useless.\n\nToo bad the execution of the game is terrible. Sometime you get stuck into walls, sometimes when you dash you get teleported back. The graphics don't help understand the game. No tutorial, the "help" in game is rather confusing. I understand this is an early access game and it's in alpha stage, but I can't help it.\n\nIt's a very good concept and possibly a very good game, but it's so badly executed for now, it's not worth more than a dollar, and you will probably just play it once.

Keep that in mind before I break something that causes you to hate me. More.\n\nThis game is okay. From what I've 'played', it doesn't have graphics setting that appeal to me in any way. I'd rather that it had some sort of 'Advanced' menu, wherein players could manually lower and raise visial settings. Maybe I'm just used to Source games. A selection of sound sliders (Music, Dialogue, SFX .etc) is definitely needed, and perhaps a means of rebinding keys for players whose mouses have more than three buttons.\n\nThe reason 'played' is in quotation marks is because I only got to explore the menus. Maybe it's a case of pilot error, maybe it's just because there are no hosting servers in my area (Doubted), but the 'Browser' wasn't able to find any servers, even if I had the ping filter set to no limit. I will have to judge the gameplay based solely on what I've seen of it, and that makes a terrible review. Nonetheless, from the videos and pictures I have seen, the level design is decent enough to be interesting, but I feel it could be more detailed.\n\nI have no further substance or experience to keep this review going, so I won't.\n\nI cannot recommend, advise against playing this game. but, because I have to choose...I will not recommend.","April 24, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ikrani/recommended/335430/","ikrani","Ikrani","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ikrani/","37 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's buggy as all Hell and needs a better tutorial.\n\nThese are the two reasons I quit so early in. The game isn't anywhere near ready for player testing. The tutorial was near non-existant, being quite literally nothing more than a single screen that tells you the controls. Nothing about game modes, basic tactics, or even debuffs, which I'm only aware of because of a particular spell description, not anything the game showed me. After that single help screen, I was dropped into a game in which I was able to gather was sort of like a domination mode, but that's it. I was totally lost.\n\nThe second reason I stopped playing was all the things in the coding that clearly need work. The initial browser screen made me think it was about to crash before it sent me to the menu scree, which ALSO looked horribly incomplete with the "Profile" option yielding nothing more than a single grey box of stats. Then, when I tried to switch over to fullscreen mid-game in order to better enjoy it (as if), the game minimized and refused to come out, like it didn't want me to see something it was hiding. That shouldn't be an issue if it's an option. Hell, why wasn't fullscreen the default setting? It's not like I could go anywhere else on my computer while the game was running (and I tried).\n\n"It's in Early Access" is no excuse. Mordheim: City of the Damned already has a passable tutorial and solid, non-confusing gameplay, and it still lacks character progression or permanent statistics, which it knows come secondary. Grimoire needs to leave the Steam Market and go back in the oven until its tutorial and coding are given a major overhaul. Until then, I can't recommend buying it. Playing it during a free weekend like this one, maybe, but not buying it. Not for $13.\n\nI will say this: the idea of a spell-based first-person-shooter intrigues me, but the way it's presented leaves much to be desired. I can't even comment on the gameplay because I had no idea what was going on at all times.","April 25, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

I love the way it combines a concept of first person shooters the concept of a moba (multiplayer online battle arena) into the game. Despite the fact that i had only played for a few minutes (not even lol), i do have some suggestions for the game. There should be a map included into the game. Also, the ammunation for the "flames" should have a set limit; I would say about 500. Other than that, this game is amazing for an "early access game". Definitely would recommend it to people who have SOME desire for a moba and more skill in first person shooters.","June 25, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My first few minutes in I didn't know what I was doing.\n-The spells were meh. I would have loved it if you could mix and match spells or maybe you can I don't know the UI was confusing.\n-There are only two factions for a game like this I would have loved to have seen more and a story element. Of course this is only early access but you know maybe that can be added later. And I also wish the Faction you joined was permenant that way people know which House you are with.\n-You can't change controls the current controls are kinda bad which should be implemented soon.\n\nAll in all I reccommend after a few more patches and tweaks the game will be splendid but currently it is what I feel more or less a tech demo.

Wrong! This game isn't about spawn camping or sniping, it's about killing your enemies in the most stylish fashion, wether you prefer freezing or burning or crushing. Behind the low rez graphics there is the element of fun wich you obtain regardless of your place on the scoreboard. This game makes you laugh, cringe and even rage quit at the most crucial moments when you team needs you the most. But regardless of the ridiculously sh*t graphics and sounds this indie game could easily turn into a gamers all time favourites if developed properly.\nSo here is my advice, buy the game, ignore the problems and continue playing until your mouse catches fire because if you don't I almost certain you'll hang yourself the very next morning.","June 26, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here is my scoring :\n\nGraphics 5/10 - This kind of graphics needs to be polished to level of 2015 year graphical advancement. we're play on 2004-2007 games graphic level. These days graphic should be glossy, but we're see rectangular graphic. This game needs to be graphically close to crysis 3 with  maximum settings on to be  play enjoyable as possible. Graphical settings reset itself bug needs to be fixed.  Spell graphical fx needs to be enchanced\n\nSound 6/10 - game needs to be added more diverse sound and some great tune for background play music .Spells casting sounds needs to be updated.\n\nControls  7/10  - This game have good display of buttons on help screen but it needs to be added possibility to change controls key bindings.\n\nGameplay 6/10  This games that goes to FPS/magic similar to Ziggurat and counter-strike . I like it so much.But it lack items available to use for duration of match . Items like staff and instant spells not available in your sphere of magic . Game needs more dynamic gameplay enchancing modes.\n\nThis game scores  6/10 this quite mediocre game overall with great idea ,but it lack better visually appealing look and more dynamic gameplay .

I love the way it combines a concept of first person shooters the concept of a moba (multiplayer online battle arena) into the game. Despite the fact that i had only played for a few minutes (not even lol), i do have some suggestions for the game. There should be a map included into the game. Also, the ammunation for the "flames" should have a set limit; I would say about 500. Other than that, this game is amazing for an "early access game". Definitely would recommend it to people who have SOME desire for a moba and more skill in first person shooters.","June 25, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My first few minutes in I didn't know what I was doing.\n-The spells were meh. I would have loved it if you could mix and match spells or maybe you can I don't know the UI was confusing.\n-There are only two factions for a game like this I would have loved to have seen more and a story element. Of course this is only early access but you know maybe that can be added later. And I also wish the Faction you joined was permenant that way people know which House you are with.\n-You can't change controls the current controls are kinda bad which should be implemented soon.\n\nAll in all I reccommend after a few more patches and tweaks the game will be splendid but currently it is what I feel more or less a tech demo. Once it hits beta I suggest you pick it up but for now I can't see myself telling someone to pay for this.","June 27, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The utility and movement spells are very great and can sway the flow of battle if used right. The sound effects are acceptable and the graphics a bit sparse, for some that is a dealbreaker for me however that is just fine since that means the game can run well even when everyone is firing off loads of spells at once. However that brings me to the meat of the reason as to why I cannot in good conscious recommend the game, in short it is dead like any mage that tries to fight the lightning mage in an open field, totally and completely dead. I poke in every once in a while and the servers are flat out empty, and with no bots or players to take potshots at there is no reason to stick around.\n\nDo not misunderstand me, I think this is a great game all things considered and I don't believe I've seen a game like it, FPS arena based magic shooter kinda deal. but its dead which is terribly sad maybe when they take it out of early access, offer it up like steam have some sort of ingame store. maybe do something to make it accessible to more players and revive the community it'd be worth looking at","July 27, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
