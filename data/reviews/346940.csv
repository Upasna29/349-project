AMAZING!  If you love Shadowrun, then you have come to the right place.  As the games go (Shadowrun Returns or Dragonfall) This is the obvious evolution.  All the polish you saw in the directors cut of Dragonfall is here and it shines like a new set of chrome arms.\n\nThe story is engaging, each character--from your fellow runners to random people you chat with on teh streats has their own personality.  It really makes the world feel alive.\n\nAs gameplay elements go, the Matrix has been redesigned.  Even with modern hacking--the goal is to avoid/supress the defenses of the system you are hacking.  This element was completely absent in previous iterations of the Matrix (SRR and DF)\nThis new matrix is totally awsome--you could jsut run in there and fight through---but with a little skill you can avoid it altogether!  On top of that, there are new hacking mini-games that add some flavor to trying to get that paydata.  overall i am very impressed--kinda wish i rolled a decker now.\n\nAnyways, the game continues--I just got 3 jobs and am about to head off\n\nSee you in the shadows, chummers!  more to come as i get through it...\n\nUPDATE:  ok--been playing for many hours now and i can safely say that the game is great.  As stated before, the writing is top notch---and it really shines through in every character you meet.  I find myself wanting MORE from each character--they each have thier own backstory that really tugs your interest.\n\nAlso, the game time i have?  I haven't even made it through the first 3 "side" missions you get.  And no i haven't just left the game open.  There have been a few re-loads (matrix runs are much more challenging when you get caught...) but a lot of the time is spent just reading--there is SO much lore in this game and each of your fellow runners seems to have a full range of dialogue to flesh it out.\n\nSo to sum up--if you like Shadowrun and/or old school RPG's (i guess the official term is cRPG?) then this is the game for you.","August 20, 2015","true","33.5"," 214 of 253 people (85%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","85","214","253","11","13"

I was sceptical initially, seeing how the first two games were decent, but nothing special, really. But this is a whole new level. A lot of content, a lot of detail. It feels expansive in a way classic RPGs could feel expansive. Writing is top notch, almost unexpectedly so. I haven't seen much of the story so far, but the world, character backstories and development, even banter - all this is a couple of levels above your usual RPG stuff.

Its fixed now!\n\nI remember writing somewhere in the Shadowrun:HK forums before it came out how annoying and stripped the UI was of the older games. That you couldn't trade items within missions, and that you had no way to position your party tactically before battle, not so bad if you're a street sam - really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if your main guy is a squishy mage or decker.\n\nI believe my exact words were something like ...do you see real-world SWAT or military have the tech specialist wander up and open the door with all the burly armored dudes with assault rifles randomly grouped around behind picking their noses?\n\nThe UI is still stripped. But now its got the ability to ambush, giving you a few rounds to place your team before the shooting starts. You can trade items inter-party too while on missions, and give found items to anyone with a free inventory space. Its way better. People had been complaining about how stupid the inability to trade and the inability to control your party out of combat was, so Harebrained fixed it. Good on them! Now to get them to put some kind of minimap, especially since the levels have gotten huge.\n\nThey cleaned up the models too, so dwarves and orks dont look so ridiculous. Overall, the models are much cleaner. The running animation kind of reminds me of The Venture Bros though...\n\nSome sequels suck. This one does not. HS has learned from the first 2. Theres more of everything, including plenty of awesome char portraits for each race/gender, unlike the first one where female trolls had what...5? You can see that HS has found their stride, listened to their fans, and cleaned up some of the glaring flaws of the engine and game.\n\nIf you liked the first 2, even if you thought they were flawed - get this game. If youre a fan of Shadowrun, get this game. Its way better than the others. Dragonfall:DC was good, this is better. If you havent played the first ones, pick up Dragonfall:DC first, otherwise I can pretty much assure you you'll be disappointed going backwards.\n\nI cannot WAIT to see what fan-generated content shows up!","September 13, 2015","true","14.7"," 102 of 116 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","102","116","7","0"

I'm a sucker for the Shadowrun lore and setting. So, my opinion might be kinda biased.\n\nBut with that out of the way, the game, to me, feels amazing - as others have said before me, if you liked SRR and Dragonfall, this is absolutely a must have. The story, at least as far as I've gotten into it, is on par with Dragonfall, along with interesting supporting characters and personal stories. The enviroments feel much more alive and vibrant with the new setting, getting in an even more colorful, exotic enviroment.\n\nLoving the serie, I can't say much of the story, since despite the time I played I'm still pretty much at the start, but the writing is very good. And I could already see some interesting puzzles and hints to make your life easier on at least one run. Just a little hint, don't dismiss poetry slams.\n\nThere's comedy, there's intrigue, there's a mistery that I hope to solve, and there's characters I love.\nThe new Matrix is a really good step forward from the old interactions, in all aspects: artstyle, musical score and expecially mechanics. Not to mention some glimpses of other places as well, but I won't go much further discussing them, I'm still not sure how much they've been implemented.\n\nThe game isn't devoid of problems, obviously.\n\nThe artstyle is amazing, but the models do seem a bit dated, and despite that in opening/closing the menus I've seen some weird loading times or framerate issues. Nothing major, and with the nature of the game definitely not a dealbreaker in any way, but still something to keep in mind.\n\nThe animations, expecially the running one, still feels slightly off, BUT, spell, lightning and other visual effects HAVE definitely been improved.\n\nAlas, I do have some gripes with the new Matrix system: mostly, on the controls. While the addition of free matrix movement and the new system are really amazing, point-and-click controls in my opinion don't meld really well with the nature of the minigame (For those of you who played Dragonfall, the AZT tower first room is a good reference to have an idea), and the camera sometimes works as much against you as the IC that you encounter.\n\nIN SHORT:\n\nPros:\n-Looking nicer and quite slick, with a lot more modelwork and with some snazzy effects here and there.\n-Voice acting in some parts and animated cutscenes!\n-Interesting characters and story\n-New Matrix system!\n-Lots of new stuff and mechanics, like spells, augmentations, different spirits etc.\n\nCons:\n-Still some really really minor framerate issues in navigation/opening menus/etc.\n-Matrix system is nice, but with some control and camera issues.\n-Some animations look slightly off.\n\nIN SHORT:\n\nIf you liked SRR and Dragonfall, this is an absolute yes. More of what you love, with some extra cherries on top.\n\nIf you are new to the serie and curious about the setting, this is a good chapter and it's self contained (as Dragonfall was self contained from Dead Man Switch.) Pick it up and give it a whirl, but be warned you might find the first games somewhat less enjoyable after getting used to the new mechanics and stuff.\n\nIf you don't like CRPG's, lots of text, and a slower, more methodical approach, or you didn't like the first two games, then chances are you won't like this.\n\nSee you in the shadows!\n~Jariel.","August 20, 2015","true","13.4"," 103 of 119 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","103","119","5","2"

Then Dragonfall came along and that improved on the aspects I thought could be better after the first game. Mainly the writing for the dialogue, characters and story improved a good deal, which I was very happy to see (reminded me of how Obsidian improved on the writing for Mask Of The Betrayer after NWN2 vanilla campaign).\n\nNow we have Hong Kong, for  me I just wanted more of the quality that Dragonfall had and a little bit more open ended. Sure enough the maps are pretty huge, the graphics looks improved and the same great writing from Dragonfall. If you loved Dragonfall you will love this. If you thought Returns was cool but could be vastly improved I would highly reccomend you get Dragonfall and then Hong Kong, these two are pretty nice improvements over the first game imo.\n\nAnother big thing is this is the first Shadowrun game of this series that is built for JUST PC and not other platforms aswell. You can see that aspect helping things out to, as I said above the levels are bigger, graphics and art design is improved I think that is partly do to them just focusing on pc this time.\n\nIf you want another good crpg style rpg or if you like the Shadowrun universe give this a go! It is very very hard to do a game in a a series after it has hit it pinacle like it did with Dragonfall, thankfully this is more of the same, but in a good way. Dragonfall was brilliant ana vast improvement over the first game, Hong Kong does the impossible and keeps up the wonderful roleplaying at high levels like Dragonfall did.","August 23, 2015","true","20.8"," 50 of 59 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","50","59","2","12"

No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nSince 2013, we have seen the re-emergence of a classic RPG IP: Shadowrun. Boasting some fantastic storytelling and art direction, Shadowrun has been very successful thus far. With Shadowrun: Hong Kong, we have a third, equally well done entry into the series. Being a fan of this series since the SNES title in 1993, as well as the tabletop game, you can imagine my elation each time they have announced a new Shadowrun title.\n\nThe title Shadowrun is taken from one of the setting's main premises – that corporate espionage runs rampant in the near-future of the setting. A shadowrun – a successful data theft or physical break-in at a rival corporation or organization – is one of the main tools employed by both corporate rivals and underworld figures. Shadowrunners are the mercenaries who take on these jobs. Let's dive into what you can expect as a Shadowrunner working in Hong Kong.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nThis game has a lot to offer, and I will do my best to cover everything. I will probably forget *something*, so please forgive me!\n\nShadowrun: Hong Kong retains alot of the same mechanics and features as the previous two titles: You can create a character from 5 different races and 6 different character archetypes or classes. Human, Elves, Orks (yes, with a k), Dwarves, and Trolls are all available, with Street Samurai, Mage, Decker, Shaman, Rigger, and Physical Adept as professions. Each race has it's own perks and weaknesses, and each archetype has it's own strengths and downfalls. Street Samurai excel at physical combat and are typically heavily augmented with cyberware: cybernetic physical enhancements. Mages have access to a wide array of devastating spells, while Riggers can controls drones and vehicles from afar with them minds. Deckers access the Matrix with a datajack to search for an obtain important information, while Shamans commune with spirits to cast magic. Lastly, Physical Adepts are like Street Samurai, except that their melee attacks are magic-based, channelling them through their bodies.\n\nShadowrun uses a tactical turn-based battle system, using AP (action points) as a resource for all characters. Starting with 2 AP, all actions consume 1 or more AP to execute. Moving, reloading your guns (ammo is infinite!), casting spells, or using items all consume a set amount of AP. Once a character uses their AP, their turn is over and the next character gets to act. Being aware of yoru surroundings and using cover effective is one of the keys to survival many encounters. Cover offers several advantages, including higher dodge and higher defense against attacks.\n\nInstead of the standard experience points system of many RPGs, Shadowrun uses a Karma system: completing objectives awards you with Karm points, which can be used to increase several stats and skills. Body, Quickness, Ranged, and Will are some examples, as well as weapon proficiencies such as Pistol, Shotgun, SMG, and Rifle. More points in each stat means more powerful skills and abilities. Certain character archetypes utilize certain stats, so make sure you invest your karma wisely!\n\nThe majority of the game is presented in text form, from the point of view of a storyteller/dungeonmaster. Dialogue takes place often, and you are given many choices for how to respond to certain situations during dialogue. Depending on how high some of your stats are, you will have different options during certain situations. For example, if you have a high intelligence stat, you might be able to hack a computer to access it, when you would otherwise be unable to. You also have a small handful of etiquettes to choose from, which allow you to respond to things in a certain style. Academic, Shadowrunner, and Street are a few examples.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nHong Kong retains the same fantastic art direction of the previous games. During character creation, you are able to choose from dozens of highly detailed character portraits to represent your character. Environments are absolutely stunning and highly detailed. Character models are equally impressive and sharp. If you zoom in while in-game you can take a look at these detailed character models, which you are able to do at anytime. Even the loading screens feature some beautiful artwork, as well as a detailed description of the area you are heading to or a short summary of the most recent events.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nHong Kong features alot of tracks with an Eastern influence, which works extremely well for the game's setting. The sound direction for this game is just as good as the art direction. Every track is designed to help immerse you into the story and every situation you encounter. Everything has a sound effect, including your gunshots, magic, even your footsteps (which can get annoying after awhile).\n\nPerformance\n==========\nShadowrun: Hong Kong runs very well. I observed 60 FPS in most situations, with no lag, stuttering, massive frame drops, or random crashes. The game has no controller support that I noticed, and I wouldn't recommend it anyway. The entirely game is best played using just your mouse.\n\nA feature added in Dragonfall makes a return here: the ability to save your game almost anywhere. The only notable exceptions are during dialogue or during battle.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nA worthy addition to the Shadowrun series of game, Hong Kong boasts enhanced features that originated in Dragonfall. An improved Shadowrun Editior allows for the creation of your own campaigns, utilizing the Steam Workshop to upload and share them with others.\n\nIf you are a fan of this IP, a fan of RPGs, or just a fan of great storytelling, Shadowrun: Hong Kong is a great game that deserves your attention.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/D9jN1uVtlCU\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","August 26, 2015","true","13.2"," 57 of 71 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","57","71","3","2"

Most of the setting seems to consist of empty space, lots of running around from A to B, npcs lack that certain something in this game that made you feel for them (compassion, anger, disgust, etc.) in the other installments of HBS's shadowrun campaigns.\n\nSome interesting characters, but far too few compared to Dragonfall.\n\nCool new Cyberware, new skills, awesome new spells, pretty sick unique weapons and for all the adept lovers out there: weapon foci and of course, revamped matrix, wow, am I tuned for this!\nThat's it!\n\nCons:\n\nAlmost everything.\n\nBugs over bugs, starting with missing equipment of followers (that you had to unlock via skillpoints!), over vanishing equipment (be it spells, weapons, or support items) up to mission breaking bugs.\n\nDialogues are ridiculously slow paced, arduous and options are rare and even if you find options, don't bother to try out different ones, as 90% of them will merit the same outcome, especially fun in the few final missions. Oh, and what is more, one cannot substitute the attributes of their followers in 50% of all cases. You need strength 5 for something? One of your team has it... Too bad, that does not count, joke's on you, logic! Obviously a character needs to be the leader to bash in a damn bookshelf. And whereas in the other shadowrun adventures of HBS it was perfectly normal to be able to reach an outcome via different means (skills, attributes, dialogue options, etiquettes, etc.) you will find in this piece of "art" you often enough can do stuff only if you have exactly ONE skill/attribute and that half of the options is (as aforementioned) simply placebo. Search the same shelf with the [INT 3: highlighted option], too bad, nothing special. Go medieval on it with STR 5, wow, secret tunnel, who would have guessed?\n\nCombat system: where to start? Try hitting people with 50-65% and you will hit them significantly more often, as your team misses more often, the higher the chances to hit get. Half of your support spells does not do anything, if your shaman uses "Aim" to boost your teammember's accuracy, tadaaa, nothing changes.\n\nDetail and Graphics: Nice, really.\n\nItems/Gear: Half the stuff is linked wrongly or has no effect, e.g. Brain implant "NEXT" should give INT+1; Decking+1, guess what it does? Nothing.  Saeder Krupp Skillwires should give Quickness+1 AND Ranged Combat +1. You get the Quickness, Ranged Combat, however, seems to be a wrong label. Wow, am I glad I spent all my money on alpha-level cyberware which does nothing and/or less as is stated in the only game of the series in which you will find yourself chronically underpaid.\n\nMagic: Even a maxed out mage (WP and Spellcasting, yes, been there, done that) sucks hard in terms of hitchances. Shamans? HAHAHA, that was a good one. Why? Spirits (your bread and butter signature abilities) which can be summoned from your surroundings will hardly EVER have a chance to hit greater than 55% to 65% with their spells. The ones you can summon via consumable (high-level!!!) charms rock the ground, however, as this game keeps you on edge in terms of what you can afford, I personally believe it is a real atrocity to ask the player to build a character around consumables, especially one as interesting as the shaman!\n\nDecking: Again, you need to be a decker, as Is0bel (your "default" decker) has such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ skills and programmes, that you are going to snuff it, pretty much 8/10 times you enter a room that has any IC higher than just trackers. The chances to hit suck even more in the matrix than in meatspace combat, you will find your decker missing ~40% of the time when the game tells you that you actually have a 99% (!) chance to hit. Neat. Oh, I almost forgot that in some missions, the option to jack into certain jack-points is MISSING if you do not have Is0bel on your team. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot!\n\nOverall: They tried to re-create SR:Dragonfall and ended up gutting the series. This game has so many engine, item and mission bugs, I refuse to believe this is due to any other reason than blatant lazyness as the other two installments of this series are fine and even breathtakingly well done. Long story short, I backed this game on Kickstarter and got a copy, way cheaper than any of you buying it over steam, and I would refund this game immediately if I had not got it over the kickstarter campaign. Be smart, don't start, if you refuse to listen, caveat emptor!\n\nWhat is left to say?\n\nHope; hope strongly that after some time, given the strong enthusiasm we saw so far from HBS, this game will also have a final "Director's Cut" version like SR:Dragonfall that makes this game awesome, as it should be and that proves me wrong when I say "Meh, this one stinks.".\n__________________\n\nTL;DR: Buy at your own risk, rather wait for a good deal (at least 70%) or wait for the Director's Cut version entirely, too buggy, too lazy, too bland.","August 24, 2015","false","46.0"," 122 of 176 people (69%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","69","122","176","9","18"

This game made me interested in playing the other series (Returns and Dragonfall)\n\nPros :\n- Good character creation. There are 6 distinct classes, but you can make your own customized class if you want.\n- Beautiful level and environment design.\n- Memorable characters with great background story for each.\n- There are tons of choices you can make in this game. That makes you really involved inside the game. Not to mention that your choices have consequences.\n- Good writing. Every conversation is interesting. Even without voice actors, you will always get hooked into what the characters are saying. Seriously, it's like you're acting as a character inside a novel.\n- Good, balanced, and challenging combat.\n- I love the fact that sometimes you can complete your mission unscratched by talking your way through. But of course, some conditions must be met. A high amount charisma and some other status will be required.\n- Okay story, but not that great.\n\nCons :\n- I encountered a few small glitches, but not game breaking.\n- If I already scrolled to certain point of the stash and I dragged an item to change my equipment, the scroll keeps coming back to the top of the stash. This is a bit annoying. If I want to drag multiple items and those items are located near each other, I must drag, scroll again, drag again, scroll again.\n\nOverall, I give this game 9/10. A must have for turn based strategy fans.","October 23, 2015","true","38.1"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","37","43","0","0"

Really another excellent game by Harebrained Schemes. As with previous games, this one is a stand alone adventure, but of course, community mods mean you can keep playing with the updated game engine and new adventures. Additionally, this one has multiple story arcs and several endings, meaning that even with the base game, there is a ton of replay value. The story was excellent, the gameplay solid and with solid improvements to the game mechanics, most notably with the Matrix, which I thought was markedly improved. There are some aggravating bugs such as equipment given to henchmen disappearing after missions, but overall it was a seamless experience beyond that particular aggravating bug. Really, a solid gaming experience that is easy to recommend.\n\n8 servants of the queen with 1000 teeth being destroyed by my bad ♥♥♥ party out of 10. *The other 2 were banished back to their plane of existence of course*","January 24","true","25.9"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","2"

As much as I enjoyed it, I do wish they'd taken another month or three to finish polishing the game and filling out all the story lines.  Particularly near the end of the game a lot of the minor characters' stories seemed lazily finished or in the case of the magic shop owner, just NULL txt after the climactic ending battle... kind of disappointing.  I played a decker on this, my first playthrough, I liked the revamped matrix overall.  I wasn't sure how I felt about the blocker ICE mini-games... I disliked the idea of it but was good at them and found it enjoyable at the same time.  It also seemed unimportant to ever get more than a mid-level deck which is fine I suppose... I was saving up for a Fairlight Excalibur but then I just kept buying more cyber and better armor and pistols and it never seemed like a major detriment.  I hope they continue making and improving upon these games, it's been a blast to inhabit the SR universe again!  Next major step would be an engine revamp/overhaul.

In this iteration, only two of the five characters have their back stories flushed out, with personal missions garnering comparable intrigue to the main story line. That said, the main story line was not terribly interesting; however, the final chapter did have an appropriate climax and resolution.\n\nThe engagements in the Matrix have changed dramatically and you will either love or hate the change. Personally, some changes such as the password component associated with firewalls is an interesting addition. Also the ability to disconnect from interface at any time is a nice change. A less welcome change is the addition of the frogger sequence where you need to dodge the path of the security programs.\n\nWhile the main story line and personal stories of some of the characters are lacking, the brief interactions you have with NPC's in the world are short but very interesting.\n\nMission and gear:\nThere don't seem to be very many missions. I think there were maybe 10 missions before the final chapter?\nThere are some additions in terms of weapons but, in my playthrough at least, there were no special armors with attribute/skill bonuses - only cosmetic differences.\n\nOverall, the game, the story, and the changes are quite disappointing.\n\nIf you're desperate for a new shadow run game, I would save your money until the game goes on sale.","August 23, 2015","false","28.3"," 106 of 173 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","106","173","4","9"

It features a familiar "fish out of water" scenario, a cast of colorful characters and a long-awaited setting - the mysterious, energetic city of Hong Kong.\n\nIf you've ever come across this series before, then you know how boring the slums, sterile office spaces and warehouses can get. Hong Kong lets you visit the more pleasant locales too - restaurants, pirate ships, underwater laboratories, and that's not everything this game has to offer. Sadly, what you get to see has little to do with the actual city, but it does grow on you faster than, say, the gray and brown streets of the Flux State.\n\nIf it is optional content you're looking for, then you're in for a ride... or should I say "in for a read"? There is a lot of extra dialogue trees that you don't really have to delve into, but if you do, you get to immerse yourself in one of the more lore-rich universes. As usual, if you bond with certain characters, you get several side missions. Yet again, they don't offer much in terms of stpry consequences, aside from some more dialogue stuff and a few stat gains here and there.\n\nIn terms of player freedom, Hong Kong is on par with Dragonfall. You have a clear goal and a final showdown to look up to, but it's up to you how far in the world of crime you'll go to get there. Quite often the player is presented with more choices than the standard "cause trouble" and "talk your way out of trouble", however morally gray they may be. You get to choose the order in which to do the runs (and which runs not to do at all, if they don't sit right with you). This prevents the difficulty from spiking, but doesn't offer much challenge in return. Only two routes have managed to cause me anal pains, both of them in the bonus campaign.\n\nAs for the aesthetics it's 👌👌👌 top-shelf stuff. Hong Kong is grittier than Returns, leave your chummers and drek at the door. Since it's the first PC-only installment, the game feels much more lively and content-rich than it's predecessors. However, despite being consistently good, themes from the OST don't manage to stand out, unlike, say, Dragonfall's end-boss theme and No Overkill.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd like to say that I definitely recommend the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game for you. It was worth every ruble I paid for it, and possibly more. It is more of an RPG than most of modern titles are, in fact, it is one of the better games I've played in my life.\n\nI'm a big guy.","February 10","true","40.9"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","1"

The ending of the game didn't quite give me the closure I wanted and worst of all, three months after release, there are still a lot of bugs and typos. I had to restart the epilogue because one crew member wouldn't go back to their spot so I could talk to them. The final fight was acceptable, I suppose.\n\nIt wasn't all bad, but you're better off playing Dragonfall - Director's Cut. I did like the new cyberware-affinity stat, cyberweapons, and cooler portraits, but overall the whole game felt a little lacking. Gaichu and Racter are still the best companions out of the group and Is0bel was needlessly irritating throughout the game. Nothing about her character design, just her actions, motives, and backstory painted her as someone who was....not very pleasant or agreeable. I'd like to also point out that I am ranking a post-humanist psychopath and a ghoul samurai above her in terms of agreeability.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWant to love it, can't do it. Doesn't live up to Dragonfall - Director's Cut. Wait for a Director's Cut version of Hong Kong before buying.\n\nI'm a good ways into the game, and I have a couple big complaints.\n\n1. Feels like QA was non-existent. Scripts are poorly proofread and have tons of spelling or grammatical errors. At first I thought it was some idiosyncracy due to the fact that everyone is speaking Cantonese, but after a while the errors became more and more obvious and it became apparent that proofreading teams didn't do their jobs.\n\nAdditionally, programming leaves a lot to be desired. The fact that I have to wait 10 seconds to enter the matrix whenever Is0bel jacks in? What is up with that? Sometimes character models don't get their run animations and just ice skate around. I'm doing Racter's story mission at the Ares facility, and the poor AI programming I ran into there is what drove me to write this review. The other team of Shadowrunners has been naively programmed to simply run to the exit point and just stand there. They never leave the level or move out of the way. If you had someone left behind, they're stuck there and you either pray one of them moves out of the doorway for a turn to let you in or you restart the level from your last save (which is, unfortunately for me, back at the start of the mission). I'm not even to the end yet. Countless people I know have complained about even worse gameplay issues near the end of the game (portraits not switching, other strange behavior, unexplainable lag). I was going to continue with one run a day because of how long missions take, but at this point I'm too tired to continue the game at all if this is what I have to deal with.\n\n2. Story is great, it's good. Story is what defines the Shadowrun games. Somehow, with Hong Kong, it feels like too much influence is put on dialogue in between missions with NPCs and side characters. I'm a completionist, so I try to talk to every NPC until they repeat dialogue, wasn't a problem in Dragonfall. For Hong Kong, it feels like every character gets their own sideplot, and it's a little too much. Talking to every NPC after a mission takes up to an hour, and I'm stuck in a Catch 22, either I speak with the NPCs and waste my time taking in details that may or may not matter, or I avoid them and possibly lose out on a side quest for nice gear/karma or some important story detail needed for an ending. All of them seem to speak with a heavy sense of foreshadowing, so a very fake sense of obligation is placed upon the player instead of genuine interest.\n\nI'm hoping a Director's Cut will fix the programming issues, at the very least. I enjoyed Dragonfall a lot, and I saw a lot of elements from Dragonfall making their way to Hong Kong, and I think the setting and overall plot is interesting enough to warrant a thumbs up, poor programming and story pacing aside. The crew is more or less just as interesting as last game's crew (Gaichu, Racter, and Kindly Cheng are great). The game's heart is definitely in the right place, it's just implemented poorly.","August 25, 2015","false","15.6"," 64 of 103 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","64","103","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/a2o4c6/recommended/346940/","a2o4c6","Arbiter Libera","http://steamcommunity.com/id/a2o4c6/","1471 products in account","Returning back to the franchise with Shadowrun: Hong Kong feels very familiar yet fresh thanks mainly to its own Asian flavor we didn't really get to see in previous two entries. As befitting my take on these other games, this one is also not a singular experience and is most definitely worth talking about.\n\nIf you're not familiar with my previous Shadowrun reviews I'll give you a quick summary: it's a cyberpunk future meets fantasy; meaning you have your cybernetic orc-augmented street samurai running around with their group of freelancers-for-hire aka shadowrunners, but the twist this time around is we've going to Hong Kong. Specifically, second incarnation of the Kowloon Walled City mostly. I believe this game's big draw lies in exploring the Chinese part of Shadowrun setting where myths and legends are more real then anywhere else and vicious mega corporations aren't as massively influential as much as they ARE the government.\n\nNot everything is perfect, of course. With such a great setting in-hand and for the most part likable and varied characters, I'll get back to that in a second, you might be thinking it's an amazing game story-wise. Sadly that was not the impression Hong Kong left on me. Not in a sense it's a bad game or even badly written as much as the fact it comes off as disjointed with main story missions just kinda connecting without any real investment. That of course depends on how much you care about a particular character in your party and his connection to the main character as well as overall story motivation for good three quarters or so of its run time. If you're not emotionally invested in what you're being told instead of shown, and you spread out with side missions, this story will not do much for you until it escalates later on following some pretty decent foreshadowing. One thing that took me by surprise, but was something I enjoyed because it played into my tendency to explore and talk to everyone, was that some resolutions and options only become available to you after following up on unrelated and completely optional side activities or dialog. This even affects the very last decision you get to make in the main game, which might irk someone used to games clearly presenting your options.\n\nAs far as gameplay and mechanics overall go it's your familiar Shadowrun package – that of tactical turn-based RPG, although they did commit to some tweak. Primarily in the Matrix in a sense that now you can move around in real-time until you engage in combat. I'm heavily split on guard programs running their patrols and having you avoid them, but I did enjoy the new pattern matching hacking mini-game. I assume this feeling is not unanimously shared by everyone. It is worth noting that unlike the previous two games Hong Kong seems to have either pushed the Unity engine to some limit or memory leaks lead to game running choppily after couple of hours of continuous play. Bad experience also came from scripts not playing properly couple of times and game hanging up during some engagements, but that's nothing worth really dismissing it over.\n\nIn closing I'd like to mention the bonus campaign Extended Edition introduced by saying it certainly had some meat on its ones and ran for at least good four or so hours. I do wish it gelled better with the main campaign or continued it in some more meaningful way as opposed to having you chase an antagonist you may or may not even remember at the end. Good point is that it does offer you a pretty big decision at the end, even if the entire campaign comes of as weak compared to what you did earlier.\n\nTime for me to say I do recommend this game wholeheartedly although your mileage will vary depending on how much you end up caring about the emotional angle. See you around, chummers.","May 6","true","31.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"

Probably the most notable is the changes to the matrix, though I'm not really sure I like them since dodging and evading opposition isn't as fun as making it go boom. At least there were plenty of booms outside of the matrix, as well as non violent and stealthy options for most of the missions. There also were not quite as many skillchecks as in the last game, so that is kind of nice. And if there is a skillcheck, then it usually lets you pick one of your party members to fill in unless it involves charisma.\n\nThe story is decent as to be expected, with a cast of characters that tend to have pretty interesting backstories and development. Gaichu, the ghoul samurai, is an easy favorite, but the rest of your crew is plenty good as well. I'm not really a fan of setting the game in Hong Kong and the inevitable heavy involvement of triads in the plot, but it did fine with what it had. I still prefer the last game being set in Berlin, but that's probably just my own personal biases at play. Oh, and there are some cookies here and there for people who did play Dragonfall where stuff from that game gets mentioned. You even can meet one of the characters from that in this game too.\n\nHonestly, it's basically Dragonfall again but in a different setting and a few minor gameplay changes. I'm not really compelled to put much effort into this review, since most of what I said about the last game applies to this one as well. Good thing that Dragonfall was excellent.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_tetris/recommended/346940/","blue_tetris","yellow_tetris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_tetris/","94 products in account","With as much written content as a novel, branching storylines intimately linked to your character choices, and a real tabletop feel where intrigue and negotiation can supplant the need for bloodshed; Shadowrun: Hong Kong is the commensurate single player RPG experience.  It is best suited for avid readers who love video games, and for gamers who love interactive fiction.  The tactical combat, the freedom of character creation, and the a-la-carte missions should appeal to the more goal-oriented RPG fans among us.  But if you don't like to read, you'll find the game (and its predecessors) to be a bit of a turn-off (even though they are a much better read than basically every other RPG these days).  For me, the game's writing and art are on par with Dragonfall, and its gameplay has been dramatically enhanced.\n\nThe Writing:\n\nS:HK's writing is its single greatest feature.  The narrative voice and descriptiveness of the prose is unlike any you'll read in a modern game.   Even so-called indie titles whose primary content is text--housed in a minimalist frame--cannot compete with the evocative style of the narration.  Each intro scene paints a vivid picture in a concise few paragraphs.  At no point does the game talk down to its player, who is quickly immersed in the language and style of the setting with little primer.  Those familiar with the first two games may earn more from the reading experience: The lingo and dialogue of the Shadowrun universe are unique and endearing.  It is not "Star Trek"-style technobabble; it all makes sense in this dark, urban fantasy.\n\nA few grammatical errors here and there don't detract much from the experience, by my reckoning, and occur on the order of once per hour or two.  When you write an entire novel's worth of exposition without a highly-trained editorial staff, this is to be expected (and it will probably be tidied up in an update).\n\nThe Art:\n\nThe game's art style is baroque and daunting to the senses.  It is cluttered and claustrophobic, because it needs to be.  The models and character portraits stand out like beacons.  Something always seems to be hiding in the margins, lurking in the alleys.  Visual information is at a surplus--amalgamating into a chaotic whole--with blurry text scrawled on signs, arcane graffiti on every wall, and the unsettling sharpness of corporate billboards hanging overhead.  Those familiar with the series should take note of the Matrix's new visuals: Parallax foreground elements and yawning crystalline chasms give cyberspace a needed sense of openness and vertigo.  It juxtaposes well with the oppressive disorder of "meatspace".  The new assets for use in Hong Kong and its Walled City are perfect: Bold reds and yellows pour forth from the neon calligraphy-shapes of the East Asian sprawl.\n\nThe Music & Audio:\n\nThe music works well within the setting.  Combat cues are good, mounting highs and lows help steer the narrative, and the pace and length of the tracks works well during dialogue scenes.  The leitmotifs present in Dragonfall make a return, with a distinctly Asian flair.  The battle themes are all new and sound amazing: Not too gut-churning for a turn-based game.  Just enough tension to keep you anticipating your next action.  Other audio cues are rare, but make nice additions.  The ambient sounds of gambling, the squaking of comm links, the trickling of rain, and the susurrus of a crowd help to immerse the player in each type of scene.\n\nThe Plot & Themes:\n\nThe plot of the game is a tightly woven and intricate work, with nuanced and imperfect characters, drenched in a thousand shades of moralistic gray.  The Shadowrun universe benefits from this sort of storytelling.  Shadowrunners, after all, exist entirely in the margins: The margins between bad and worse, the margins between metahumanity and poverty, the marginality of magical individualism in a society that fears the imperative of individuality.  The game has more plot diversions than Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall.  Your characters' Strength, Charisma, Intelligence and other skills play a big role during dialogue scenes, where combat can be entirely avoided (or engaged with greater advantage) based on how you built your character and the choices you make.\n\nMagic users have entirely different characters they consort with during gameplay, as do techies and weapon specialists.  Bringing different people along for a run will dramatically impact what you can do during that mission, as well as the conversations that take place.  The game is more in-your-face than Dragonfall in a lot of ways.  More profane for sure (lots of ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥ to be had), grimier and more gory (with both visual and narrative horrors that work well to frame a scene), and more fantastical in its enviroments.\n\nThere are several "missable" NPCs.  If you play your cards right, you can get them on your team to use during runs.  They have an enormous amount of dialogue and a diverse repertory of skills.\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nFor those new to the series, the XCOM-style gameplay can be a bit clunky at first.  It definitely takes a bit of learning.  Having played the first two games (Dragonall numerous times), I play on Hard and combat can take a few retries.  The chance to hit an enemy is similar to a tabletop RPG (sometimes only 50% or less), which may take some PC gamers by surprise.  You need to use cover, you need to plan ahead, and you can't just use all your actions to attack.  Tactics are key.  A diverse set of abilties are key.  Crowd control is a rare commodity, and you should make sure you have a little bit in your party.  Fast-acting magi are needed to heal allies on the fly.  The occasional spirit/drone must be summoned, to tank damage for the party.\n\nIn Hong Kong more than its predecessors, combat roles are better defined and more vital--for this reason, there are NPCs around to help fill out the roster.  The NPCs' level-ups are quick and unobtrusive.  You make a simple choice for each character as you advance through the game.  No two NPC combatants are alike, and each allows you to try something new.  This is important because you can only really build one character of your own.  Getting to try out sorcery, summoning and conjuring, the firepower of a street samurai, the talents of a melee warrior, and the augmentations of a cybered-up decker/soldier provides a well-rounded experience for players who only intend to do one play-through.\n\nAll of these combat necessities are counterbalanced with the non-combat necessities of the run.  Do you need a decker to infiltrate?  Will this infiltration help you avoid combat, thus compensating for the loss of firepower?  The game is built upon big, important choices and the same run can go in two or three different directions, depending on your roster of shadowrunners.\n\nThe Matrix has been beefed up.  Stealth elements are now in play, requiring you to wait and advance in order to avoid getting "traced" by enemy programs.  If you get traced too many times, the IC shows up and you've got to fight your way out of the system.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nIf you played Shadowrun Returns or Dragonfall and liked either one even a lil' bit, get the game.  It's just as good as Dragonfall on each axis of comparison, if not better.  If you aren't sure you'll like a Shadowrun game, get whichever one is the cheapest and give it a try first.  Bear in mind, this one will be a more fleshed-out experience altogether.  If you like interactive fiction, tabletop games, or old school RPGs where your choices matter; this game will inspire nostalgia for something that may have never existed.

I don't feel like my choices really matter. The many curious conversations available in the game hub should have been connected with small playable storylines and quests. The fact that they (mostly) are not, means that these conversations ultimately feel hollow.\n\nWorse, the game mechanics often feel awkward. Why can't I use Is0bel's mine skill before battle, to prepare the battleground? Why can't I use medkits after battle? And what's up with the stealth? Stealth is a fun mechanic, and a huge part of the Shadowrun world ... but the implementation is terrible. The realtime controls are so loose that I sometimes can't get my characters to do what I want, and alarms are raised - not because of any tactical error on my part, but because the controls just didn't support my needs.\n\nWhich brings me to technical issues. The most obvious issue is the level load time. Even with a mid-level SSD, levels require 10-60 seconds to load. This wouldn't be so bad, except that I in the stealth sections of the game, I often have to reload a lot, because I'm unable to control my characters well enough to stealth effectively.\n\nThe other big technical problem is the AI. In one of the side missions, I gained the support of several NPS's, but they were almost useless in combat. Mostly, they lagged behind my team, such that they weren't even useful as damage sponges. When they did get near the front line, they made terrible choices. For example, the physical adept would power up ... then run back and forth till he ran out of AP.\n\nSo, sorry Harebrained Schemes. I love the world, and I love the idea of this game, but I can't find much to like about the execution. I like the art, but I wish you'd spent more time on story and gameplay, and less time on graphic art.\n\n","September 26, 2015","false","11.3"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","0"

Finished game at 3.0.5 version, so some points herein may not be accurate with upcoming patches.\n\nTl;dr- Hong Kong is an interesting stab at the lore of eastern Runner hub. Typical to the setting, betrayal and intrique with nice eastern twists while you work out while people are out to kill you. Several interesting party members with well-fleshed personalities. Varied and interesting missions.\n\nReview in Full\nNow, as for the actual review. I was curious to see HBS's next scheme- certainly, Seattle has always been the heart and soul of the Shadowrun world, which often sadly leaves out the other interesting hubs and lore. Dragonfall gave us a nice glimpse at the Flux state and Berlin. Hong Kong delivers it's titular city, or at least, the less savory parts of it. But I savored them regardless.\n\nNow, I'll try and keep my review as spoiler-free as possible, so expect certain amount of vagueness. After the initial tutorial level.\n\nYou're basically fresh outta prison, when you receive a call from your estranged step-father to meet him in HK. Keen on dusting off the Barren's crud from your boots, you fly off to adventure. Reunited with more than one estranged family member, you are soon embroiled in a plot involving your step-father's mysterious dissapearance and his captor's persistent attempts at having you killed. Welcome to HK.\n\nThe story unfolds pretty free-form from hereon in- you're allowed a choice of party members covering each base and skillset, as per usual, with some of them joining in on the ride later on. I found the starting party very affable and ended up having them on the team 90% of the time, if not for their obvious proficiency in getting things done, then for their dialogue and banter. For reference, I was playing a Rigger.\n\nThe missions provide a good number of choices between stealth and taking the thrillgang approach. I found myself talking my way in and out of trouble more than 'go loud', and found the game very accommodating to having your main as the Face of the party. Cheers to that.\n\nThere seem to be various skill checks of all sorts, and calls for Etiquettes almost constantly- maybe it was the smaller scope of the campaign as opposed to Dragonfall, but I definitely enjoyed having these options open, or at least, present.\n\nAs far as difficulty is concerned, I think the game was too easy by far. Then again, I've been playing Returns from the get-go, and maybe I've picked up a few tricks here and there, but I found most of the time I had no need for medkits nor revival kits. Maybe if I had been more combat-oriented rather than stealth-bluffing my way, things would've been different.\n\nThere's a lot of foreshadowing in the plot about the eventual Big Bad, but it turned out the final dungeon and the final encounters with the BBEG were almost too easy. Admittably, I had geared up with some of the strongest armour and weapons in the game, but I had expected a lot more fight out of this mysterous nemesis.\n\nSUMMARY OF POSITIVE, NEUTRAL AND NEGATIVE POINTS:\n+ Interesting take on the eastern Runner Haven.\n+ Good cast of characters, with the forerunning Gobbet and Is0bel standing out as the most memorable due to their personalities, conflicted pasts and mannerisms.\n+ Fun side missions with unexpected twists.\n+ Remixed OST with an oriental flair\n+ New items to enrich your Running experience\n+ Devs had taken time to make custom portraits for small Scene events, something I could appreciate.\n+ I'm sure any and all UGC modders will appreciate the plethora of new assets for making our own adventures.\n\n+ / - Quite short in length. Naturally, you'd want good things to last longer. :P\n+ / - Redesigned Matrix. While I am a fan of the old, and was somewhat wary of the new system, I do admit it has it's perks. Much better stealthing. Although, being of a poor memory, I did not like how the new system plays out like a memory game now. Discovered passwords should be visible at code prompts, instead of having to rummage thru your Scene notes.\n+ / - Reward choices at the end of certain missions. Loot or allies, loot or allies...\n+ / - Varied levels of dialogue ranging from excellent and funny to downright bad. Main cast dialogue tends to be on the upper scale of things, but the writer(s) just didn't seem to flesh out any of the secondary or tertiary cast, save a few merchants.\n+ / - There are no clear benefits for using Duncan's Ziptie ability. Although it's probably good karma to spare foes, the game does not particularly reward going out of your way in not killing combatants but neutralizing them instead.\n\n- Personally, as much as I found the plot interesting, I did not like to be hammered into a certain role in terms of the story. Having that freedom taken from me sort of put a damper on the roleplaying experience. Felt like taking stage cues from the GM or storyteller most of the time.\n- As the game currently stands, having the Laser Sniper rifle combined with an autoloader and Monofilament Whip turn you into a one-man army, as they are ludicrously overpowered. I even gave up using drones mid-way thru the game after I had purchased this fearsome combo.\n- Lack of Polish. At 3.0.5, there were still numerous instances of missing or wrong dialogue, formatting errors in the dialogue itself, some anomalies with armour item losing it's AC, Stash lag and surprisingly long load times which may be attributed to the updated game engine, dunno. Hopefully fixed in the future.\n- Final fights pose no real threat. The main baddie does not live up to their reputation.","August 31, 2015","true","28.2"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","6"

Those familiar with the other games will want this game primarily for the updated editor, which allows a multitude of new options via UGC. Note: the Matrix environment is different to all previous HB games.\n\n-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-` START `-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-\n\nThis is the 3rd modern iteration of Shadowrun to come from Harebrained Studios (excluding the original 'Dragonfall', which was an add-on for SRR), and it's another on-rails extravaganza. However, a lot of extra features have gone into this experience that will ultimately bode well for people keen to create their own adventures, via UGC (User Generated Content).\n\nShadowrun has a rich tabletop history, which HB have tried to bring to us three times before (Shadowrun Returns, the SRR DLC, 'Dragonfall', and the stand alone Director's Cut version of 'Dragonfall'). Each time, new features emerged; each time there were several flaws (that said, each iteration was satisfactory; low replayability, however).\n\nThis game was made from a tabletop perspective: create your own stories, to share with others. It's a noble goal, but tabletop games are meant to be played *with* other people, not *by* 1 person alone. This is the critical failure of the Unity-engine based Shadowrun games, and it's something that can't be fixed due to the nature of the game (sandbox, no multiplayer).\n\nYou can not revisit areas. You are on rails. The story that plays out tends towards linear (due to the complexity involved in properly branching choices taken in-game). You are not allowed to grind karma and nuyen indefinitely to build your little super shadowrunner.\n\nPeople play Shadowrun to build a character, and a story, and essentially live vicariously through their created avatar(s) in a universe that can be *imagined* by a group of players. These games are very static & limited; what you see is what you get.\n\nAn example of some of my gripes: despite some *very* gorgeous art assets, once you've in an area & have completed the mission, you leave and (90% of the time) you can't return to the area. Once the game is over, most UGC won't let you import your character over. Just like SRR, when Telestrian offers to make you his executive, you're like "Cool, what's next?". Game ends, go away. Just like that. That's not *Shadowrun*, dammit!\n\nBack to the game...this game *currently* has numerous typos, bugged scripts, bugged enemy AI & corny/flat dialogue in parts. I'm sure these will be looked at & addressed. Conversely, it has expanded in-game options substantially (the kind that are utilized in the editor). Monofilament whips, fetishes, expanded cyberware, passive totems, a rejuvenated Matrix environment...this game has had a *lot* of love put into it.\n\nThe rejuvenated Matrix is a vast improvement if you come from a tabletop background. These sorts of people are familiar with the fickle nature of the dice roll. You might have great stats, but if you botch a roll you get slapped down. And vice versa; you could have bad stats and be in a bad situation and roll multiple crits. The element of luck is ever present. In the previous iteration of the Matrix, there was a random element but it was hidden in the code (% to miss/hit). You were limited by your stats in a very real way.\n\nNot so in SR:HK. You can, with patience and skill, skate across the ICE like a pro, even if it's not reflected in your stats. In many situations, you can avoid combat altogether. The time-based memory puzzles add a subtle layer of complexity to hacking, but my personal gripe is that it's is *far* too easy & should be nerfed slightly according to stats. You can literally have Decking of 1, a crap cyberdeck & a datajack & be fine with the Matrix for the entire game. Dead serious. The changes are good IMO, as it allows skill and luck to affect Matrix play.\n\nOverall, despite some flat character development for many of the characters (it's there, but it has a paper-thin veneer), the plot is compelling & exciting; I liked this just as much as Dragonfall. I find it hard to say which is superior as they are both solid. I guess Dragonfall nailed the Matrix better, whilst Hong Kong nails the mystical stuff better (that said, no Astral Plane again *dammit*).\n\nI'm a big fan of the Shadowrun tabletop game & the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis/Megadrive & Mega-CD game(s). I've backed, played & enjoyed the previous HareBrained Studios Shadowrun games. Would I buy another Shadowrun game if it is Unity-based? Yes, but *only* because I am a diehard. Also, if it was another Kickstarter, I would likely refrain from backing at a high tier.\n\nThe format has been thoroughly explored over several years; it just isn't a good enough framework for a *true* Shadowrun game. I'd wager money that if Harebrained made it clear from the start of their Kickstarter that it would be extremely similar fare to the previous game(s), they would have struggled to reach 100% backing of their funding target. People are *sick* to *death* of this limited engine. Yes, I understand that the ultimate goal of all the games is for people to create better runs via the editor (which is why Unity is being used in the first place), but the monumental amount of effort and talent need to make something close to the base campaign is *frightening*.\n\nIf Harebrained can get together and find the magical formula that can distill the tabletop experience into a static video game, that would be the cyberpunk holy grail. These Unity-based games simply give the scent of the 6th Age; a compelling scent, but a scent, nonetheless.\n\n-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-` END `-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-`-","August 24, 2015","true","57.3"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

Whether or not you'll be able to enjoy the game will be entirely based on who you are: are you a person who's willing to sacrifice consistency for high points, such as optional character's story telling and very indepth battling? Or will you have problem with the low points of missions that miss the mark completely and missing elements of narrative that tie things all together. In the end, I enjoyed my time with Shadowrun: Hong Kong, but the game will take a toll on you, and it's definitely going to cause a polar reaction out of people. Check the lists below for more details on exactly the positive and negatives that this game has.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/1ypf7TJ4TzQ\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nThose who like choices making a difference in game will find Hong Kong right up their alley. Limited resources and plot changes will make every choice feel like it made a difference.\nWorld is intriguing to say the least in terms of the cyberpunk/magic fusion. Do like how the story was woven with some of the smaller events to make it feel like a truly thought out experience.\nCombat at the core is solid with lots of options and a lot of ways of dealing with your opponent.\nOutside combat options and ability to pass checks never distracted but combat but felt like a welcome change to what was going on, and I did like talking my way out of things.\nLayout of battlefields and different missions worked well. Lots of variation in cover and different combat scenarios.\nLike the idea of future content being available through steam workshop.\nThe optional characters stories and back stories shine. Gaichu and Racter were my favorite characters, with Gobbet coming in a close third.\n-:\nThe inconsistency. It feels like several elements were left on the cutting room for before they were finished, which hurts the game overall. Too many options may have been given here, as opposed to polishing some of the ones that existed. The game feels like it isn't the vision that the team had when all is said and done.\nAI can do some dumb things, but it's all over the place for the most part. Those who I've talked to that are trying to get through hard mode are noting ridiculous hits and unfair challenge, but on normal, they'd follow up a smart play with a dumb one.\nIt takes a while to get everything under your belt, and with no real “teaser” of what each class does, you may be restarting a couple of times.\nThe bugs. I'm not talking “oh, that's funny” kind of bugs, but the bugs that forced mission restarts. There's a lack of quality control here all over the place, and it shows up in the worst ways at times.\nHit percentages? Basically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in my eyes. Don't know how many times I missed a 90% shot repeatedly in a row, but it got into double digits.\nReally, no mage character besides mercs that you have to pay each mission? This feels like a real bad over sight.\nLoading times are insane.","September 4, 2015","true","35.7"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","20","28","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerealwar/recommended/346940/","cerealwar","Rinndo Caine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerealwar/","147 products in account","Shadowrun: Hong Kong suffers from murky storytelling and horrendous pacing. I'll forgive a poorly told story, but that story better be injected with fun. The game's pacing is what brings it down a notch.\n\nAfter an exciting start, the game gets bogged down by two hours of exposition. After that, you move on to missions, a few which are interesting, but a majority of which are dialogue driven affairs. That brings up another problem. In Dragonfall, you could get a long way with three intellect and four charisma. In Hong Kong, you either invest a great deal into personality stats or find yourself getting into a lot of easily avoidable, dumb fights.\n\nUnlike Dragonfall, there are no "big" missions. They're all  tiny side missions that are, for the most part, light on combat and extremely heavy on the dialogue. If you're a combat oriented character, this makes for an experience where your celebrated shadowrunner looks like a simple thug.\n\nAfter each mission, you're expected to return to base and talk. Some of these talks are fun. Some conversations seem to go on and on, with characters speaking in circles. The tedium is interrupted every so often by unnecessary meetings with your boss, where you find out that you're no closer to finiding the answers that your looking for. In Dragonfall, you took jobs to pay for a final mission. In Hong Kong, you take jobs to pass the time between the first and final act.\n\nMoney and karma are an issue. Cybernetics don't just require essence and money, they require investment into a new skill tree. Do you get more karma per mission to invest in said trees? No, you only get 8 per mission. You'll receive less cash per mission. Now you may get more missions than in previous titles, but more missions means more medpacks and grenades. I remember being able to restock before every mission in Dragonfall, and getting a big enough payment before and during the final act to deck myself out. And one of your biggest cash outs isn't given until the very end of the game where it's no longer necessary.\n\nOn the plus side, combat is less tedious than the previous titles. Your party members seem to hit a lot more often in this installment, and you get more milage out of their abilities. The enemies' stats on the highest difficulty aren't as minmaxed as they are in Dragonfall, and your companions are statted out to be pretty effective in combat. If these improvements carried over to the matrix portions of the game, Hong Kong would have had the best matrix sequences out of the three games. But now the matrix sections involve puzzles and frogger segments. Fights where you have one character running the matrix, and the rest of the party fighting off security, become a bogged down nightmare.\n\n*SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD\n\nThe driving force of the narrative is the mystery of why your foster father wanted you to come to Hong Kong, and what happened to him. Your relationship to him is revealed through dialogue with your brother, which always break down into him complaining about your current predicaments, and him realizing that he has daddy issues. Your between-missions chats become tiresome after a while. You'll receive missions from two of your crew mates early on, and if you don't do them right away, you'll be locked out of conversations with them for the majority of the game. If you complete their missions towards the end, you better be prepared to slog through long, out of place talks that should have been delivered between missions thoughout the earlier portion of the game. You will not appreciate Racter's "beat around the bush" style of speaking, right before you head off to start the final mission.\n\nWhere Dragonfall builds up to the final mission, Hong Kong brings it up abruptly, where you boss tells you "Hey, you can do the final mission now, but you better finnish your last three jobs". And the ending really feels tacked on and forced, as if it's supposed to follow the ending formulas of previous titles.  *END OF SPOILERS\n\nSteam says I've spent 66 hours playing this game. I spent 20 of those hours asleep, having dosed off between missions. I probably spent 3 hours loading between screens, 18 hours in the main menu, and 15 hours reading dialogue.","August 25, 2015","false","68.3"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","23","34","7","0"

If you are a new player, look at other reviews.\n\nThe story is really intriguing but follows the same lines as the previous: Some big bad supernatural mojo is happening, and you have to do something about it.\n\nYeah, I have a lot of hours on this. The engine is still held together by masking tape and chewing gum, so I leave the game on while I do stuff like cook dinner instead of endure ridiculous load times. Even after all the patches, there are stuck dialog bugs and stuck NPC bugs from time to time. It's inconsistent and I've no idea how to reproduce them. It seems the more campaigns I play, the more bugs I encounter.\n\nI've played 3 campaigns and each had different NPC bugs.  I had Crafty's conversations stuck on the same loop, and she is one of the most important NPCs to talk to regularly. I also had NPCs not appear where they were supposed to after cutscenes. Some of these bugs require restarting a level or even the entire campaign to fix and are incredibly frustrating, especially when you have lost progress. I've also seen buttons not trigger properly after cutscenes/dialogs. You have to make separate saves constantly to avoid these messes.\n\nAfter 3 games, they still don't have a way to address combat UI problems like moving to a space behind another character because clicking on that space selects the blocking character instead. When you try to shoot from beyond weapon range, the game doesn't let you know that your character will leave cover to move foward before taking a shot. This is a very serious oversight especially since the game never actually tells you weapon ranges in actual numbers. I've also seen enemies move positions after reloading a game, and characters starting combat with wrong amounts of AP.\n\nThings like line of sight and flanking angles are some times non-intuitive and really hard to figure out, and along with BS RNG, this makes combat a chore, especially when it loads 10 times slower than a fully modded Skyrim. Seriously, it's faster to terminate the game and restart than it is to ask it to load a save game while one is in progress. Some things that look like they should be cover are not, and things that look like they shouldn't block your vision does.\n\nPros:\n* Best story so far (IMO)\n* most interesting companions to date (IMO)\n* better weapons (melee especially)\n* better cyberware\n* melee is very strong now late game due to new weapons and cyberware (still weak early)\n* riggers can use 2 of the same drone\n* a lot more missions where meeting etiquette and charisma checks will avoid all combat (good for role playing)\n* ley lines cause spells to bounce and heal the caster every turn (makes up for being out in the open. In previous games, it was often not worth being on ley lines cause you can get chunked hard)\n* you can boost essence by investing in to body stat. This allows magic users to get some nifty cyberware and not gimp themselves.\n* creative placement of some paydata outside of the matrix\n\nCons:\n* rifles still king of DPS, especially with auto-reload cyber armlaunchers\n* mages/shamans still weak and boring\n* haste 4 has been nerfed (shamans do not need more nerfs)\n* new real time stealth matrix is terrible\n* new simon says matrix hacking is terrible. Both this and the above relies on player skill, not character skill, which is stupid in a RPG\n* End game missions seem much easier than in previous games, and not only because of new weapons. There seem to be fewer enemies, shorter levels, and the end boss is an anticlimactic pushover.\n* there is still really no reason to make your main character a decker. The provided party member is more than adequate and the matrix doesn't really get too hard until the very end.\n* money is still SUPER tight, especially if you want to get cyberware in addition to equipment.\n* there is no reason to use the paid shadowrunners as money is so sparse\n* companions still have mediocre builds and are unreliable in combat without shaman buffs, making it important to build your main character as a combat specialist\n\nI guess in conclusion, only get this if you want more well written Shadowrun stories.

If you liked dragonfall (which is an excellent game by the way) then you should enjoy this, and if for whatever reason you didn't like it then odds are you won't be happy with this either.\n\nShadowrun is a neat cyberpunk tactical rpg with a turn based combat system. In my opinion the strongest part of this game is the writing. Also it looks good (for what it is) and the combat system is fun. Everything that I found annoying in Dragonfall seems to be fixed (mainly inventory management).\n\nIt's one of those games that is hard to stay away from and those are rare.","August 20, 2015","true","33.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","1"

Shadowran so far awaaaay!"\nShadowrun: Hong Kong = XCOM + Baldur's Gate + Haunted Noodle Machine + So many words.  So many.\n\nNote: This review takes into account the added content of the Extended Edition\n\nAh, Shadowrun.  The IP that just never really quite gets the attention it deserves.  Originally based on a tabletop RPG game that lovingly mashed together cyberpunk literary classics such as Neuromancer with the traditionally high-fantasy festooned world of elves, orks, and dragons.  If you don't remember Neuromancer, just picture the baby of Lord of the Rings and The Matrix and you'll do fine.\n\nSince it's tabletop days, it has had a few different incarnations as a video game, to very mixed quality and success.  Hong Kong is the 3rd in a line of well-received CRPGs that have all been enthusiastically supported by Shadowrun fans through Kickstarter.  A success story for both fans and developers, and it shows how much of a cult following the IP has maintained over the years.\n\nIt is also this cult following, however, that has given something of a critical pass to this series.  Remove the Shadowrun license and you'd be left with an RPG that does great things with text and...  Well, just competent things with everything else.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  It's fun to play and the gameplay isn't bad. it just doesn't stand out.  Also, for every step forward Hong Kong has taken from it's predecessors, it seems to have also taken one back.\n\nCombat is turn-based and somewhat tactical.  Meaning you want to take advantage of cover and positioning and prioritize your targets carefully.   I only say somewhat because most fights for me tended to degenerate into stun-lock and DPS rinse/repeat cycles.  Use Action Point-damaging abilities to stunlock enemies that aren't immune to it, then have your close range DPS monsters tear apart everything else.  Also, RNG is as strong of a mechanic in battles as your tactics are going to be.\n\nCybernetics have gotten a bit of a rework, with a new ability-tree to that effect.  While being able to get perks for a cyber-focused build is neat, the ability tree itself is a bit of a head-scratcher.  All but ONE of the cyber-weapons are melee and use Strength and the Close Combat skill.  One weapon, however, the mono-filament whip, is a ranged weapon and uses Quickness and Ranged Combat instead.  The problem here is that you will start with the claws if you invest points into the Cyber Affinity tree, a weapon relying on strength.  If your intention is to use the whip, then you are basically either wasting points in Strength to use the claws until the whip becomes available, or you are left with a weapon you won't use taking up essence until you can get the whip.\n\nThe decking component of Hong Kong has been fleshed out and is no longer just a stripped-down version of the normal combat.  You must make your way past patrolling "Tracer IC" and getting into any combat will increase your System Trace.  If that hits maximum, then the system goes into alert mode, spawning a deathsquad of attacker IC at your location.  Also, hacking into data nodes now includes a mini-game that is a simple pattern memorization, and reminds me of the "Help Me Rhonda" bit from Short Circuit (what a terrible, terrible movie).  However, despite these additions, Hare Brained has also taken a step back here.  I found Matrix runs to be sometimes very tedious.  The added stealth mechanics of avoiding Tracer IC isn't particularly enjoyable when you have to have to clumsily float through them, making the passive "Boost" program that increases your float-speed basically a slot-eater on all of your decks.  Direct IC combat has not become any more enjoyable for the changes either.  Instead of finding a good position, it's often much better to just use the accuracy buff "Sniffer" program and then use all of your AP into dealing damage.  Often cover is impossible to get to anyway as the Tracer IC will be sweeping through it.  Altogether, the decking scenarios themselves just weren't as well done as the regular combat scenarios, which already left some to be desired.\n\nThankfully, the story-telling is still top notch.  There is no voiced content still, and it's extremely text heavy, to the point that you'll be forgiven if you think that you're actually playing a visual novel instead of a CRPG.  On the whole, I did enjoy the story quite a bit.  I liked that there is a lot more moral ambiguity in Heoi, a setting where even the "good guys" are still bad guys, over the relentless idealism of Berlin and the Flux State.  Your Johnson isn't a well-meaning teddy bear, but a very ruthless ganger kingpin.  You rub elbows with thugs, not hippies.  That said, I still ended up loving the story and characters of Dragonfall over those in Hong Kong.  They all somehow managed to grow on me.  It's not that the characters in Hong Kong didn't - I loved Gobbet, Rachter, and Gaichu.  However, Duncan and Is0bel were entirely disinteresting to me.  That could be just my tastes, but they both seemed to be lacking depth.  Duncan's only character progression is basically in direct relation to you (something that ends up not even mattering at the end depending on which ending you get), and Is0bel's problem is similar.  I get that she doesn't know how to interact with people well, neither did Eiger, but she has very little to add outside of her character flaws.\n\nI also enjoyed the setting of the Walled City, with the host of lore and superstition surrounding that den of squalor.  However, being familiar with the actual Kowloon Walled City, I don't think the terrifying scale and density of that place was very well-depicted unfortunately.\n\nTake the run from Mr. Johnson if you...\n\nLiked the first two games.  It's basically more of the same and you can't do wrong here.\nEnjoy story-driven experiences.  The Shadowrun series of RPGs is famous for this for a good reason.\nLove RPGs but are a bit tired of the same old castles and dungeons.  Maybe it's time for a little Mega-slum in your life?\nSlot a BTL chip instead if you...\n\nHave gotten a bit tired of the Hare Brained formula.  Again, this game is more of the same.\nAre more gameplay than story focused.  If you aren't a reader, stay far away from this game.\nAre looking for challenging gameplay.  Even on the "hard" setting, the game isn't terribly difficult, with most of that difficulty relying completely on RNG rolls.\nThe Bottom Line\nIf my review sounds overly-critical of a game that I'm actually up-thumbing, it is only because I feel that a good series, while being just that, good, is stagnant.  Given the great stories, it has been relatively easy to overlook the dated visuals, the just-okay gameplay, bugs and sometimes wonky AI, and very static NPCs and environments.  With Hare Brained now having several other pans on the burner (other games in development) I am thinking that maybe we are at the end of the run here, chummers.\n\nI truly do love what Hare Brained has done with the Shadowrun IP - they've basically taken the Doc Wagon to it and saved it from death quite honestly - but if they want to continue to lead the way for Shadowrun CRPGs, they are going to need to take some great strides forward.\n\nThe developers should look toward some of the great creativity that modders have come up with to create much more appealing environments and mechanics.  I'd love to see worlds that really pop and come to life rather than feel like a low-poly character dropped into a static painting.  Open up the tactical possibilities of combat and make me rely on the environment more, make weapons more interesting, and choosing combat abilities less straight-forward.  Make the Matrix like a 2nd world.\n\nUntil then, I'll be in the shadows, lah...","March 2","true","94.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

I bought the Directer's Cut of DF so what I was playing was a more polished game and a much more exciting finale. Whereas with HK I get the skeleton of a similar game but with some disappointing (but acceptable) shortcomings.\n\nSo with that being said, I would advise you to wait until this gets a Directer's Cut to really get the most out of it. You might be like me though and couldnt wait to play this so we have to live through the lack of polish.\n\nMy only BIG gripe though was how boring the Matrix mini-game was.

Then you'll most likely enjoy this one as well.\nWhile it isn't as much of a clear case of a pure upgrade and improvement like with Dragonfall and the first official campaign SR:HK added enough small changes and toys so that you have some stuff to experiment with while keeping most of their tried and true formula intact. It uses the combat system of Dragonfall Director's Cut and also has the customizable perk systems for your fellow runners which was also introduced in Dragonfall DC which is a very nice addition.\nSome of the completely new stuff include new spells, some changes to older spells, new more varied drones like sniper and auto fire variants, new decking rigs, a new cyber affinity skill for chrome and mostly more chrome itself, especially cyber weapons like cyber claws or a cyber leash.\nThe matrix segments also got overhauled, it offers more visual variations but the biggest change is that you can sneak around and crack firewalls with a minigame in order to avoid combat in the matrix almost completely if you wish. If you don't you can just let seekers spot you until defender drones spawn which makes the matrix pretty much play out like in the previous shadowruns. The sneaking in the matrix is frankly extremely clunky but the option to avoid fights is a very welcome one and even if you trigger the alarm the fights aren't as grindy/boring as in the previous games' matrix sections.\nAnother change which I really liked is that in general you have a lot more opportunities to use non combat skills and quick thinking to avoid a lot of fights, a lot more so than in previous instalments. Which is not only nice for roleplaying reasons but it also is very handy in situations where you would be kinda under-equipped and the fight pretty darn difficult.\n\nThe story/mission structure hasn't really changed, you eventually end up in an hub area from which you launch your missions, and you're mostly free to chose which mission to tackle next.\nYour fellow Runners are a pretty interesting bunch again with entertaining/interesting dialogues between missions even though I have to say that some tended to be a bit less memorable than in Dragonfall. I feel that especially with Is0bel they could have done more - while her personal quest was very enjoyable the hub interactions with her felt rather bare bones. Props for the other companions though.\nAnother nice touch is that you get a chance to have a small conversation with each mercenary runner you can hire. Similar to what Dragonfall DC did with Lucky Strike just a bit less detailed but for all mercenary runners.\n\nThe plot itself is arguably more simple than Drgaonfall but personally I feel that Hong Kong has the best atmosphere of the Shadorun games yet which is saying something because I always enjoyed the setting and its atmosphere a lot. The music is spot on and helps to reinforce the atmosphere and the cutscenes and writing further cement it.\nAnd the basic point remains that I very much enjoy the setting of Shadowrun, its cyberpunk and its bleak dystopian world and HK does a good job of bringing the setting to life yet again.\n\nIn conclusion it's easy to recomment Shadowrun HK to fans of the series, the only real flaws I can think of is that the pure plot is rather simple if that is very important too you - or that if you feel like you've grown bored of the previous games' formula then this game prolly doesn't add enough new things for you to to shake things up.\nOtherwise I really enjoyed the game, especially that you have more dimplomatic/non-combat opportunities than ever. But most importantly for me I absolutely adored the atmosphere of the game and the mystery of it. It's gonna be interesting to see how a replay feels after the mystery has been lifted - I guess we'll see soon enough ;)","September 5, 2015","true","125.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Hell of a ride, I must say. I was hungry for more when I finished Dead Man's Switch and Dragonfall, now this was truly a feast. I must admit wasn't an absolute improvement over previous two installments, but I'm saying this only because the bar is already so high. Nonetheless I'd take another Shadowrun game over most other RPG titles anytime without a second thought.\nSome people will complain that Hong Kong is way too text heavy, and while I'd agree that Dragonfall had a better pacing, having a better balance between passive reading times with action, it's still way better than having filler fights, fetch quests, crafting, grinding, farming and whatever other glorified ways to waste your time that plague many games of this genre. If that's your thing and you think Skyrim is the best example of an RPG out there just stay away, or better buy this game and leave it in your backlog lol. But if you value good story, high quality writing, a rich and atmospheric setting, interesting NPCs and party members, freedom to do things your way and see consequences to your choices (within a reason, of course) and adventures that start when you hit "new game" and get a complete and satisfying closure before you see the credits, this game has it all.\nIf you enjoyed  previous games for the reasons mentioned above, I don't have to tell you all this, I'll just say you're safe to buy this one. If you didn't play them, however, I'd recommend try them first, and while Dragonfall is quite an improvement over first campaign, Dead Man's Switch does a good job at introducing the Sixth World's setting to new players.","August 25, 2015","true","45.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The year is 2056, a dark and dystopian world, a world filled with Orc gangers, Elf corporate wadge-slaves and dragon dictators, a world where magic and cybernetics mix. Raymond Black, the man who took you off the street as a teen and raised you, makes a desperate call to you and your step-brother Duncan to meet him Hong Kong, but you arrive to a chaotic conspiracy where you must burn your former life and survive as a Shadowrunner mercenary for the triads.\n\nPros: Once again an improvement over the previous games of the series, from the UI to a brand new selection of equipment. The background stills are just as gorgeous as we got used to, but character models are much more defined, especially Orcs and Trolls that are much less stocky-looking. The writing is as good as ever: Your crew but also merchants and crooks have their own story to tell, many of which have funny moments very reminiscent of (and likely inspired by) tabletop RPG player experiences. Your hub, Heoi, feels more dynamic, with NPCs such as other pay-for-hire Shadowrunners that come and go in between missions, talking about their expertise and past experience when you catch them while they're around. Your crew is much more involved in runs: each mission's progression, conversations and resolution will play out differently from one crew combinations to another, adding to the replay value of the game. You even get to chose your own character's past and history through conversations, choices that carry over throughout the game in future interactions and relationships. Music is just as immersive, some are Asian-inspired remixes of familiar tracks, others brand new compositions that really contribute to fleshing out the atmosphere of Hong Kong. The Matrix feels more alive with a sleeker look & feel and reimagined puzzles and behavior patterns for surveillance and defensive software and ICE.\n\nCons: The main story is still rather linear, and the ending feels short or rushed, likely in an attempt to leave it opened for the upcoming Shadows of Hong Kong mini-sequel DLC. Although there's a wider variety of combat animation, the tactical combat still falls short of other more combat-oriented games, like the XCOM or Shadowrun Chronicles games. Combat in general feels too optional, and can too often be avoided completely.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!\n\nThis is the best Shadowrun game to date, with truly excellent writing on par with Shadowrun: Dragonfall, and that offers a large variety of ways to approach every interaction and mission. Of course, if you found no appeal to those past games, the improvements in this one won't change your mind. But to others, this is a great CRPG that I definitively recommend! I can't wait to see what the new and improved editor will allow the community to create for Steam Workshop!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","August 29, 2015","true","46.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

You end up leading a group of mercenary criminals (Shadowrunners), each with their own talents and personalities. As you progress, you investigate the reason for the message calling you here, and even the city itself, which seems to be affecting everybody in a negetive manner.\n\nNow, to the part where I tell you how this game is the bee's knees, and how it stands against the previous entries.\n\nLovely game, a real improvement from Dragonfall, much less Returns. HK goes deeper into Shadowrun lore, with the inclusion of the HMHVV and extensive references to events, including the Desert Wars, and the activity of dragons other than Loftwyr or the Feuershcwinge. The  Matrix is  improved, having more of a fluid motion aspect rather than a near-constant turn-based navigation like the previous enstallments. Many of the NPC's have custom portraits in the dialogue, lending more immersion to the experience. Speaking of dialogue, the dialogue is great. I mean, it was great in the last two, but i think that the dialogue in HK is *GREAT*. Each Character and NPC has a story (academic etiquitte if you want some more dialogue options with your team, especially Ractor), and your opinion of those characters change the more you interact with them (looking at you, Reliable Matthew, you beautiful SOB). Unfortunatly, there are some long-winded characters that aren't very memorable, i.e. the talismonger in the Five Elements (When talking to her, i just read the last couple of sentences and still got what she was saying). Thankfully, a majority of characters are more interesting and are well-worth talking to, not only for information, but also for the simple pleasure of it. Not only when interacting casually with characters is the dialogue spectacular. During missions, the dialogue between people is just as important as putting a hole-shaped hole in their head. When you hear, "We've eaten burritos tougher than you", it really makes you think about the bigger things, you know? Not to mention the ghost noodle machine, which made me contemplate human mortality and the transcending of our fragile bodies to become a part of something greater (seriously tho, ghost noodles super sp00k). As for the missions, the main story missions are good, but I always found myself wanting to finish as many miscellaneous runs as I could. I would actually argue thet the misc. runs are more enjoyable than the main ones, in particular the missions from your crew members. Nevertheless, HK is an excellent entry in this interesting series.\n\nWith ghoul and deathless\nI stand, cutting foes like wheat\nNot to mention, rats\n\nVerdict: Novahot","August 28, 2015","true","47.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","10","12","5","0"

From early on with the first edition ruleset when I played the paper and dice version with friends, to the SNES version to today's offerings I have always been keen on the hybrid, genre smashing world of Shadowrun. One part Cyberpunk and one part Fantasy.\n\nWith several decades of both table-top roleplaying books and novels to pull from HBS has taken many of the important elements and injected them into this series of games. SR:HK promises a revamped matrix (something my Decker is keen to jump into!), better 'maps'/lanscapes, improved choice and more interesting non-player characters.\n\nThe world is controlled by massive mega-corporations who do battle with one another by using 'Shadow Runners' as their illegal proxies.  Much of the time in the Sixth Wolrd (another name for the Shadowrun Universe) the strings are ultimately being pulled by a powerful entity such as a Dragon and thus the term - Never Deal With A Dragon which was lifted from the title of a SR novel.

It's not deviated strongly from the formula established by the previous game - you have a hub area and you go on runs while waiting for the plot to move forward, getting to know NPCs and team members during the down time. Not necessarily a bad thing, though I do wish they would've mixed things up a little bit with the format. The story does rely a bit too much on telling rather than showing (we're often told that conditions inside the Kowloon Walled City are real bad, but we see precious little of that, for example), and the game does not have an antagonist as interesting and well-characterized as the previous game's.\n\nThe writing is all around great, as expected, and the gameplay is likewise solid. All the same, it feels like it's retreading old ground - beyond a few minor improvements to interface and the gameplay, it does nothing new - the structure of the plot is similar in that your central goal is revealed early on and much of the game is spent doing other things before you can pursue it. Unlike in Dragonfall, you're not actively working towards a goal, but rather passing the time until plot-related events crop up automatically, which I felt was an unwelcome change, as it deemphasized the player character's role as principal actor, though this is a bit of a minor quibble.\n\nFurthermore, there seem to be less impactful choices to be made than in Dragonfall, and there's less of Dragonfall's bits of cleverness, like the metacommentary on RPG dialogue conventions that was Eiger's throwing back your empty compliments at you. Some things did leave me guessing - a character I thought to be a minor NPC turned out to be regularly recurring character who hated my guts, and I'm unsure whether this was because of my conduct towards him or whether it was pre-determined by the writers. If it was indeed the former case, I suppose I'd have to be quite impressed - nonetheless, regardless of how he feels about you, that entire subplot amounts to exactly nothing by the end.\n\nOverall though, I'd call this game an excellent work that nonetheless fails to reach the heights of its predecessor's glory. If you liked Dragonfall, you'll definitely enjoy this a great deal.\n\n9/10 (I took one point off because you can't romance Gobbet)","August 21, 2015","true","25.6"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

This title is stand alone and playing the previous games is not mandatory to enjoy it, though you will miss out on a few nods here and there. Players control a team of Shadowrunners - mercenaries performing illegal operations for anyone with enough cash - while trying to work through a complex and vibrant plot of family secrets, mystical danger and corporate espionage.\n\nFans of earlier entries in the series will find that the mechanics have received some much-needed polish: my own experiences noted hefty changes to the Shaman class and to decking in the Matrix. Combat feels mostly tight, and you seldom feel you have wasted your karma, no matter which skills you have invested in.\n\nI don't want to discuss the plot very much, because that's the main reason why you play titles like this, but I consider it on par with Dragonfall's in terms of quality. I cannot gush enough about the characters - no other series comes to mind that has managed to produce so many well thought out and well-written individuals, both on the team and off. If background information  and dialogue are big sticking points for you, then the game will not disappoint.\n\nThe only real negative I can discuss for SR:HK is the frequency of bugs. Every patch fixes things further, but there's nothing more frustrating than eating a load of damage because the game decided to lag out and skip half of your characters' turns in combat. I see a big dip in the number of issues that people are having since release day, but in a game that can be sometimes unforgiving, it just takes that happening once to leave you raging.\n\nUltimately, I would say this is worth it at full price and a must buy if you can snag it during a seasonal sale. Play time for me clocked around 30 hours for one run through with full completion, so I absolutely got my money's worth. Highly suggested for fans of strategy RPGs and excellent writing.","September 6, 2015","true","47.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

If someone liked the other games, they'll probably like this one. It has the same music style. Same art style. Same character leveling. Same skills. Same gameplay. It's basically the same game with a different story. As such, you could easily call this a new DLC adventure of Shadowrun: Dragonfall. So that's the basic recommendation - if you like the others, you should buy this. I did and I enjoyed it. Somewhat...and that's the kicker.\n\nI'm not nearly as happy with this game as with the past games and I know why:\n\nEmpty\nDerivative\nDisjointed\nPCs and NPCs\nThe Matrix\n\n\nEmpty: Tthe maps appear to be bigger. They're lovingly created and visually appealing. I've always loved the art style in this game. But they often feel empty and underutilized. There's very little compelling content that rewards you from straying the least little bit from your course. There are no quests off the beaten path, no interesing rabbit holes to fall down into.\n\nDerivative: The game and story are entirely derivative. It's impossible to play this and not feel like you've played this before multiple times. FAs I said above, it's bascially the same game with a different story. But even the story isn't all that different - you run into a problem, watch someone get killed in the opening adventure, end up working for a broker who feeds you jobs, interact with the same computer terminal, do the jobs and finally advance the story. It's Dragonfall's premise all over again.\n\nDisjointed: Unlike Dragonfall, where the above quest-system made great sense, this is a wasted opporutunity. Instead of nibbling around the main plot line by facing some weird incidents to build tension towards the final climax, you're off on entirely unrelated missions that aren't all that interesting. As I said, this made sense in Dragonfall because you had to make bank to advance the plot line. Here, they're just something to do for a while. So the plot is very disjointed. You go to the Walled City early and then never again until the final battle. The plot about dear old Dad isn't all that interesting and doesn't even make all that much sen sense. The denouement attempts to explain it, but by that time it's far too late. Missing Dad is just a plot device and an illogical one at that. So the missions and the mission structure are a massively WASTED opportunity to bring a more cohesive adventure to the story.\n\nPCs and NPCs: The ghoul was a nice touch. The others...forgettable. Your brother? Annoying. The NPCs here really took a step back and weren't all that interesting. And there's still no control of their leveling. The specials are an attempt to give you some control, but frankly they're not all that great or that useful. I'd much rather have the ability to shape my party the way I saw fit. And it didn't help that my character - a sword-wielding street Samurai - happened to be the same exact type as the only interesting NPC out there. As for the player character, I didn't see how any of their responses would have changed the story much if at all (with the exception of keeping the vampire girl alive). In short, the PC doesn't matter except to be the wall that everything bounces off. When will HBS learn that the best stories often have the PC to go through a journey and not just move through the story without impactng it?\n\nThe Matrix: The gameplay in the matrix is still incredibly annoying. Even more this time with their "Simon Says" hacking game and the overall detection meter. It's not fun and it's not interesting at all. It sucks. I finally started using the deathray cheat to make it through these parts. And at times you simply can not avoid it. It's terrible and HBS should entirely dump the systems and start over there because they're making it worse, not better.\n\n\nAgain, it's not that it's a bad game. I'll give it a thumbs up review. But as for Kickstarting the next one in this series or buying it at full price? I'd have to see some genuine advancement in gameplay, strategy and story telling before ponying up dough again because I feel like I'm playing the same game over and over again - especially when this version isn't as good as the last one.\n\nVerdict: A tepid thumbs up. Very tepid.","August 22, 2015","true","15.1"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","4"

The story is tight, the characters are great, the music is damned good and the overall combat has been improved quite a bit since the original Returns/DMS campaign. One point of contention would be the revamped Matrix, and I personally fall into the camp of "LOVE IT!" - the changes uplift the Matrix from being a grinding combat-heavy annoyance, to being a from-the-books stealthy and exhilerating challenge.\n\nI very much appreciated the revamp, that's for sure.\n\nSadly, as much as I do recommend this game to cyberpunk fans - Shadowrun or otherwise - I would also recommend waiting for a couple of patches first. As of right now, version 3.0.4 on 26th of August, this is a HELL of a buggy game. Early Access levels of buggy, in my honest opinion. Everything from minor text issues, to full on quest/progression breakers. This game is buggy. A patch or two? It will be fantastic, I have no doubt, and every bit as good as its predecessor Dragonfall.\n\nOh and one last thing, I don't care what anybody says; the hit chances in this game are beyond FUBAR.

Giving up on my team is going to be hard. Gobbet, Is0bel, the insane Rigger, and others. No spoilers..\n\nMy profile is incorrect on how many hours i really played since for some strange reason it didn't capture like 48 hours of gameplay but the shadowrun series by THIS company is amazing.\n\nOverall:\nWhile of course all games have flaws, I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in GREAT story, and semi challenging combat as well as expansion of the Shadowrun Verse.\n\nIts a must play, I want more. Below are pros  and cons, but that sums it up.\n\nPros:\nAs with the previous installments a compelling story, that draws you in, makes you care about your team, and has a dark theme. There is magic, technology, assassins, mercs, and all the things you can want in an action game, but with a TON of lore.\n\nThe added artwork for cutscenes with voice overs, just adds to the flavor of the game.\n\nSound track to the game is great, enter a club and instantly feel like oh yeah you wanna dance.\n\nThe updated Matrix and hacking for me was brilliant, intellgent addition to the game play from the prevoius games, Way more memorization and intellgence into how to navigate the game. As a Decker you will have to challenge yourself to memorize to break security even if you have the best equipment. I hope the future games build upon this model of Decker life.\n\nCons:\nThere were some gameplay issues, there still are some gameplay issues but updates have fixed some of the errors.\n\nFor me even playing on hard mode, some of the combat felt a little bit unbalanced and too easy depending on the team you took with you on the run. You team scales very fast yet, some situatoins there were harder ways of doing things, and sometimes I wondered if my choices had a impact on HOW easy the fights turned out.\n\nI wish there was a total stealth option to the game play where with the right skills and abilities, you could navigate your way around all security to get the loot or achive objectives.\n\nMy only biggest complaint in the series besides the bugs, like sliding in the matrix and sometimes wishing there were a few more indications what skills i'd need on a mission, is, i'm going to have to wait for another one.\n\nHow long? Why can't this series have a yearly release. Or even better we get shadowrun games in the spring and the fall.\n\nI know it would tax the developement team, but really do enjoy the games more than most series.","August 24, 2015","true","17.1"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

There are several twists and turns that lead to a climactic ending as well as the usual side missions that are available if you choose to complete them.  The additional missions are not directly tied to the story, though, I would still recommend them as I had a blast playing them.  The personal story missions of your teammates, as always, were a highlight of the game as well.\n\nCombat, for the most part, is how you would remember it from Dragonfall.  You choose four of your team for each mission which plays as an isometric RPG until you enter combat where it becomes a turn-based tactical game similar in many way to XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  Cover, action points, RNG-based accuracy, and abilities galore are all present here.  Decking in, however, has been upgraded.  Now instead of fight after fight you have the opportunity to stealth through most of the areas and avoid cyber combat if you so choose.  There are a few mandatory cyber battles that are unavoidable, however.\n\nDialogue in the game has been improved further as well.  Most noticably are the options based on your character's skills.  High strength?  Bash down that barrier or intimidate that thug with your bulging biceps.  Talented rigger?  Those drones that were previously set to activate hostile to you will now start firing on their operators as soon as they power on.  Impressive charisma?  The new executive will see the wisdom in your suggestion to hand over his passcode to the company intranet so that you (a maintenance worker, of course!) can fix a few errors that would cause management to be very upset with the next quarterly report that they receive.\n\nAll in all, a great tactical RPG with a story that kept me entertained throughout.  Be aware, however, that this game has a ton of dialogue in it.  If you're not a fan of reading it may turn you away from the game but if you're a lorehead and want to learn more about the Shadowrun universe it will definitely hold your attention.  I recommend the game to Shadowrun fans of all kinds and those who enjoy deep RPGs with an assortment of interesting characters and locations.","January 11","true","31.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Shadowrun Returns is on the right track, definitively.\n\nAs a longtime player of the P&P-RPG Shadowrun, I thoroughly enjoyed this latest installment. Of course it has its problems, but on the whole I can recommend it to anyone not too hooked up on graphics or other shinies. This game further improves on the original Shadowrun Returns and its first official successor Dragonfall.\n\nAs with Dragonfall in regards to vanilla Shadowrun Returns, Hong Kong makes further small improvements on the gameplay and mechanics that I personally welcomed as good additions (for example having a Mass Effect 3 like skilltree for your team to give them certain powers as they progress in level).\n\nPROs:\n- Story is very good. In fact I'd say it is the best so far.\n- Very well written dialogue with interesting special options if you developed the right skills, providing a satisfying RPG experience\n- Atmosphere is very immersive, the texts (yes reading! see below under CONs) are painting a pretty good picture of the Awakened Hong Kong in all its corrupt glory and misery\n- Quite a few points in the storyline where you have to make decisions influencing your later game in small ways.\n- Interesting characters as fellow runners with good backstories and their own missions. I never used hired help.\n\nCONS:\n- A LOT of reading involved (didn't mind that myself, but it is not for everybody). Nothing (exept pro- and epilouge) is voiced over\n- Limited possibility to equip your fellow runners. They mostly have their own weapons and equipment and don't need stuff you might want to give them. That is on one hand fine, as you won't earn enough money to equip everybody with the best stuff anyway but it takes away some of the fun (for me at least).\n- Occasionally ATROCIOUS AI in regards to neutral NPCs in combat (had a physical adept - supposedly helping me - run circles for the whole fight while his mates and my team died)\n- Same for the odd enemy AI (not to spoil anything but the final boss hardly even attacked my team during the whole fight).\n- The hacking minigames during matrix runs are an interesting feature but it gets old very quick.\n- the odd bug (had bought equipment like spells disappear between runs occasionally)\n\nWhile on first glance the number of cons does seem to outweigh the number of pros a little, this is mitigated by the fact that the cons are - to me - minor annoyances as I play primarily for the story experience not the gaming challenge.\n\nIf you played and liked Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall, Hong Kong is a must have in my opinion. If you didn't, you might want to check them out first, as Hong Kong features improvements over them that you will probably miss when going back and the lack of which might lessen your enjoyment of the earlier installments (especially of the original).\n\n8/10 would shoot plastic man in the face again","January 8","true","76.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","1"

I'll explain how and get straight to why I think so.\n\nPros:\n\nTeam inventory management!! Finally! It allows you to re-assign items when your own pack is full, or send to your stash.\nNew Cyberware enhancements, weapons and upgrades. There's some nice new hardware to play with!\nWhen you count the individual tasks for your runners, it feels like a longer game (which is nice). Took 30+ hours to finish.\nHBS nailed it with the HK atmosphere, theme, music, etc. Very nice research and execution.\nBig changes to the Matrix. It now mirrors meatspace -- it's real time, then switches to turn-based when you get detected. There's also a hacking mode where you have to correctly enter sequences of numbers several times before you can "hack" the firewall. There are little to no instructions how this works, so you may have to figure stuff out through trial and error.\n\nCons:\n\nThe missions don't pay much, so it's hard to deck yourself out with all the best cyberware. I had 4 empty slots when I completed the game.\nI have never hired any external runners for my jobs; don't need 'em, (or wanna pay extra), so maybe make them more compelling (better stats, skills, etc.). Otherwise why have them there?\nIt's still too short! Just when things get really fun (e.g. getting 3 APs to play with), the game's over!\n\nComments:\n\nAll in all, I think the enhancements (revamped Matrix, etc.) did add fun to the game, the hacking wasn't too tedious since HBS did the puzzles with multiple solutions, which is nice -- it shows they thought about all the angles. I wish it had a sandbox mode that allows you to continue when the main storyline is completed, maybe with a random mission generator? I saw a mod that allows animal runners, which i thought was a great idea, so I hope HBS will include that in future SR franchise games. To me, the story felt less disjointed than Dragonfall (i.e. all of a sudden there are dragons and they take an interest in the affairs of humanity? WTH?).\n\nAnyway, it was satisfying to play  -- the story and characterizations were good, and getting better. It's just a little too short -- still. Nonetheless, thanks for making SR:HK, I did enjoy it, and I have big hopes for the franchise!\n\n7.5/10.0\n\np.s. latest extended edition update gives us another 6H of play in HK!

Don't look at my time stats, as i am pretty lazy and left the game minimized often for a whole week.\nStory-wise, it's pretty great. The script isn't surprising but offers lots of different runs (missions) and jokes are quite good as well =)\nYour crew and other NPC's have their stories that you need to unfold along the main quest, and every time you talk to crew member or surgeon in the city you learn something new about them, it keeps you going and digging into their past.  You feel very close to them when you finally learn their secrets.\nGame is worth buying only thanks to writing.\nEngine and bugs: Game engine sucks. Big time.\nOptimization is okay, but everything else is a mess.\nI got quest bugs(even after patch 3.0.7), game icons shift from their places after some time, I have to click several times on the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ icon over and over to finally trigger it, many animations should be at least 2x times faster.\nThere should be at least combat speed adjustment in the settings. Seriously, third game and i still have to wait through long boring fights with enemies that suck, just because there isn't simple combat speed setting and animations take ages to play.\nMusic plays when the game is minimized.\nDeveloper doesn't seem to care about feedback because those are same technical mistakes as in previous games.\nSound: Soundtrack is good(though i'd love to have more tracks) and complements the overall mood of the game. There are not many ambient sounds and sometimes game feels a bit empty but sound is good overall.\n\nOverall: So i'd say game rightfully deserves 7/10 for it's story and writing but there are many annoyances that could keep you from enjoying it.","October 25, 2015","true","228.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The missions are more varied and have a unique narrative and mechanical twists to them. Your crew of runners are the most varied bunch so far, although unlike Dragonfall, they're almost always on your side with no sense of winning anyone over (which makes sense in HK's story).\n\nThe only two issues I've had so far have been the redesigned Matrix (which is real-time stealth until you trigger an encounter). It's clunky, frustrating and bugs out if you enter the Matrix in the middle of real-world combat. The other issue are the bugs themselves, and rather than gamebreaking ones, there are many moments where dialog seems to bug out, is lost, or doesn't properly advance (not for the main missions, rather side stuff like NPCs in your hub or optional dialogs in missions).\n\nShadowrun still manages to pull off the closest atmosphere to a pen-and-paper RPG among modern games, setting the stage so well and not having its lower production values get in the way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamseph/recommended/346940/","iamseph","Cerberus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamseph/","286 products in account","A somewhat dissapointing game after Dragonfall.\n\nOverall: not recommended, some game changes that have not been made good enough for release, a poorly integrated and not especially interesting story, some small improvements over past games but not enough of them\n\nThe new hacking system is an easy, uninteresting puzzle game that doesn't seem to scale with difficulty (easy even on Hard mode). So it just becomes an annoying delay.\nThe use of realtime stealth mechanics in the hacking system is a bad choice, the game engine is not suited to realtime mechanics and is also quite jarring to include when everything else dangerous is turn-based.\nThe inability to use programs outside of combat is also annoying, as that is exactly the time you most want to use repair programs or security supression programs and it doesn't make any sense for it to be barred out of combat.\n\nThe game still has the problems of the past games of being quite slow-paced, with lots of tedious running back and forth between vendors and quest givers without anything interesting on the journey.\n\nThe dialogue is also quite restrictive and doesn't often reveal interesting information. The options are all very heavily "toned", kind of telling you who your character is a bit too much, not leaving you much freedom to play a character.\n\nThe good points are pretty limited:\n* some interesting new cyberware ideas (though the magnet arm is a laughable concept, it's at least an interesting and useful option to have)\n* they fixed the problem with the enemy always shooting first while your guys are standing dumbly in the open (since you were in dialogue mode not tactical mode at the start of combat), they normally either move into cover on their first go or you get to go first, which is a welcome change\n* you can initiate combat without going through dialogue! a much-needed addition!\n* you can trade items between party members\n\n(spoilers)\n\nThe story is not well integrated and thought out. For example when you utterly wreck the mission with the whampoan council by killing the council, you barely get a slap on the wrist from the *ruthless triad boss* employing you. I at least expected to have to convince her not to exact punishment (like by explaining that the ghoul is a good asset + the council are unreliable liars so better that they be replaced). In addition the actual investigation into the whampoan council is somewhat dissapointing in the "investigation" side of it. There is no real puzzle or deduction to the game and I find I can just keep clicking through without thought.\n\n\nedit:\nI have now attempted playing the extended edition campaign. I say "attempted" because I couldn't bear to finish.\nWithin minutes I was finding sloppy proofing errors in the dialogue, extra words in the middle of sentences, dialogue that makes no sense. The player is forced into a mission and given no option of resistance or any good reason why they should do it (not everyone is evil enough to hurt people just for revenge). It railroads the character.\n\nThis could be tolerated if the gameplay is good, but it isn't. I didn't play very long but I soon found fights had no clear indication of what the parameters of the fight are so you're left guessing blindly and only find out what you missed when you fail to do the thing you didn't know you needed to do...\n\nOverall. The expansion seems like a sloppy, half-hearted attempt at meeting their KS obligations. I am increasingly disappointed by HBS.","December 19, 2015","false","111.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Certainly the best of anything current (though it will never live up to Planescape: Torment of course, nothing can).\n\nThe closest thing I'd call to a complaint (and it really isn't a complaint, more of an observation) is that I suspect it will be perceived as being a little too verbose.  Certainly the game is FAR richer for it, but I suspect the average player will get rather impatient with the almost extravagant florid descriptions and dialogues, which concerns me in that I want more games to take this level of textual effort over something like eye-candy, but reality is unlikely to reward cerebral quality these days.  As far as I'm concerned, this is a good thing, I just worry that it will work against the game's success.\n\nAt any rate, this game is a more than worthy successor/expansion from HBS, despite a few niggling bugs and more than a few proofing/editing errors.  I'd have liked to see a little more character interplay (especially among the secondary and tertiary characters), but what's in the game is more than appetizing.  There were also a few missed opportunities, but I suspect deadlines played a factor into a few of those.\n\nDefinitely worth the asking price, especially if you like cRPGs and doubly so if you like the IP.

There is not that many additions for those who've already played Shadowun: Dragonfall, but the developers seem to have improved the overall gameplay nonetheless.\n\n> Combat is straight-forward but more dynamic than SR: DF due to more abrupt means of enemy elimination, such as Duncan's Subdue, allow for much speedier resolution.\n> NPCs are well fleshed-out and impressive in their backgroudn stories. The game's take on the Walled City is quite interesting and deserves praise.\n> The game features some new character art (presumably via Kickstarter backer portraits), which are quite an upgrade on the diversified stock portraits from SR:R and SR: DF.\n> Martix system seems to be overhauled (as per KS stretch goals) but it's a moot point whether it's better or worse. Aesthetically it's much better than in previous games but gameplay-wise it's often frustrating to get +20 Trace (increasing the alarm status) per round.\n> Game length is acceptable, considering the side missions et cetera. Harebrained will also release an extra campaign to resolve some loose ends from the original campaign. Even without that, as per previous SR games, alternative means of gameplay are visible to the player (i.e. if you need a particular skill for a dialogue but don't have it, it'll often -not always- appear to you, so you may try that out during you next play-through).\n> The soundtrack is very well executed and fits the game's theme extremely well.\n\nOverall, the game is definitely worth every penny paid for it.

Most praise and criticism in my review of that game applies to this game as well.  This review will primarily focus on the changes.\n\nFirst, the positive aspects of the design…\n\nThis is perhaps the most non-linear game in the series.  At any given point there are usually 3 or more missions you can choose from.\n\nI particularly enjoyed Ractor's and Gaichu's backstories.\n\nGaichu's stance mechanic is great!  It's a pity a similar system wasn't used to make all melee more tactical.\n\nThe new cyberware is really nice, and now has sane essence costs, so you can actually make use of it!\n\nA few new spells have been added.  However, the spell list is bloated with ‘moar harder’ versions of spells, when statistics should have been used for that, making it appear as though there is more variety than there really is.\n\nYou can now click the holster button to ambush enemies.  Ambush isn't just for enemies any more!\n\nNow for the negative aspects…\n\nAs with Shadowrun: Dragonfall, the player may be waylaid mid to late game by having chosen to build a main character with a redundant class.  If you don't want to be redundant in this game, you need to play a mage.\n\nNow armor only differs in its protection rating and aesthetics.  In previous games they also affected other statistics, requiring you to make trade-offs.\n\nAll companions have most of their slots locked, so you can customize your team far less than in previous games.\n\nCompleting a mission feels unrewarding due to being paid so little it feels like an insult.  Most of the time the payout is less than half of a single level-appropriate piece of equipment!\n\nThe music is not as good as in the previous games.  It's not grating, it's just so ambient you are unlikely to notice or remember it.\n\nThe walking sound effect seems to have been changed to someone stomping as hard as they can, as if they're trying to get caught, and you only ever hear one set of footsteps, even when your whole party is moving.\n\nNow for the big one; the matrix changes.  We've been asking for a matrix that felt more unique; different from meatspace.  Apparently we need to learn to word our wishes more carefully…\n\nRemember that awful real-time stealth segment in Shadowrun: Dragonfall's Bloodlines quest that almost everyone complained about?  Apparently Hairbrained Schemes decided they could improve their game by making all matrix levels work like that, and requiring you to use the matrix on almost every mission.  Oh, and there's another meatspace mission (Whistleblower) like that in this game, in case you couldn't get enough.  But it's okay, because we gave them proper vision cones this time!  That might make it too easy though, so lets fill each screen with about 10 enemies, all frantically patrolling in tight circles, and hide most of it behind walls and fog of war so you can't anticipate the movement.\n\nThey also decided to add timed puzzles (in the same sense that the 100-yard dash is a puzzle) to barriers and nodes in the matrix.\n\nIf they wanted to involve stealth in a turn-based game, and improve the matrix, they should have looked to Invisible Inc. and the 3rd edition Shadowrun tabletop role-playing game rules for ideas.\n\nHairbrained Schemes, PLEASE revert these matrix changes in your next game.","November 13, 2015","true","48.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I did expect more action and less reading but the dialogue was well written and I enjoyed it as much as the rest of the game.  It was like reading a well written book, it really pulls you in if you let it.  The combat was fun as well.\n\nThe [party] inventory management and item descriptions could have been better.  You could not see party inventory when not on missions so it was impossible to compare gear if wanting to upgrade.  The drone descriptions were kind of vague and without being able to see the actual skills/items they had it was hard to judge which was a better choice.  I also kind of felt lost in the matrix having not played shadowrun games before and a tutorial or better help screen would have been nice.  I did however figure it out on my own without looking anything up.  There also wasn't a whole lot of interaction with the environment, just a little here and there.  Not much loot at all.

Once I saved the game and reloaded and it broke one of my side missions that I could no longer complete.  Also maybe related to the same mission, a vendor would no longer sell me stuff even though he had dialogue suggesting he still would.  The dialogue options just disappeared.

But, unfortunately, "Shadowrun:  Hong Kong" eked its way into not recommended territory.  If you've played either of Harebrained Schemes ealier games ("Shadowrun Returns" or "Shadowrun:  Dragonfall"), then you've got some idea of what the game is about and how it plays.  Unfortunately, it differs from those games in ways that I don't like:\n\n- The biggest issue with the game is what they've done with the Matrix.  It's now a real-time activity and the "hacking" inside it depends on your ability instead of your character's ability.  Intellectually, I can understand why Harebrained changed the Matrix.  But, practically, I detest it.  This is a turn-based game.  Regardless of how much they want to differentiate the Matrix from the game's normal world, there's no place in a turn-based game for real-time play.  I just don't want to play that way at all.  Ditto for the hacking portion of it.  I spend time upgrading my character, yet the hacking depends on ME, the player (and I'm no good at it :) ).\n\n- The next biggest problem is the loading times.  My system's a pretty good one with no mechanical hard drives (just SSDs).  Yet, at the start of the game, my loading times were about 30 seconds.  By the end of the game, initial loads were taking about a minute.  But, loading saved games from within the game were taking a bit over 3 minutes.  That's unacceptable.  Especially for an RPG where you want to explore different ways of doing things and different conversation paths.\n\n- Then there are the bugs.  There are a lot of bugs in the game.  I didn't run across any game-stopping ones.  But, I ran across many irritations.  Probably the biggest of those is where inventory items you give to your companions just disappear after a run.  They're supposed to go back into the Stash.  But, they don't.\n\n- Along with the bugs, I've got issues with some of the design choices the developers made.  From items needed for Achievements that are only available at one location which becomes inaccessible once you finish the mission, to characters who appear to have a story but then just disappear, to the overwhelming amount of conversation  you have to go through (2-to-1 ratio of conversation time to mission time).\n\n- And, finally, either I've become much better at this kind of game or this game is too easy.  To me, it feels like none of the missions (including the ending one) approached the complexity, depth, and difficulty of any of the missions in "Shadowrun:  Dragonfall."  Heck, I'm pretty sure the very first mission in Dragonfall was harder than anything in this game.\n\nThose last two problem areas on my list are pretty minor.  I probably could have lived with the game even with the changes in the Matrix.  But, the irritation of those loading times at the end of the game when I was going back to try different endings and paths for the Achievements just pushed me over the edge.  I got 42.9 hours of game play out of it (36.3 hours for my first run and the rest of the time getting the remaining Achievements).  If you're willing to put up with the issues I mentioned, I'd say the game is worth even its list price.  But, for me, I've still got to not recommend it.","January 11","false","42.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

I mean, this review will largely be negative, but ultimate it isn't a bad game, and might be worth a play...\n\nI already own and have played Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun Dragonfall. I enjoyed both of those games at the time and reviewed them very positively, especially Dragonfall which felt like a fully realized Shadowrun Returns.\n\nSo what do I have to complain about? Is Shadowrun: Hong Kong somehow worse than Dragonfall? No, in some ways it is an improvement. I think my problem with the game is, it is just more of the same; Hong Kong feels like just Dragonfall but with names and setting changed. Same sorta contrived story, same sorta hamfisted characters, etc.\n\nI can get past all that, but maybe the big difference is that, in Dragonfall I felt invested; the opening where an old friend/partner dies tragically, you are left to pick up the pieces with interesting characters dealing with her loss. In Dragonfall I *wanted* to find out what happens, I wanted revenge, I wanted to develop my relationships with my team and city. But in Hong Kong, I can't be arsed to care about this father-figure, I can barely be arsed about the team or conflicts facing them, it just feels so bland and boring to me.\n\nI want to say that the combat also feels bland and uninteresting, but it seems much like the same combat in Dragonfall which I recall reviewing as better than Xcom's combat. Did something change that I just can't put my finger on? Or maybe my tastes have shifted between Dragonfall and Hong Kong.\n\nUltimately, this game just feels like a cookie-cutter of Dragonfall, only with a story I can't seem to be interested in. It largely feels like the same game, when I guess I might have wanted more out of it.\n\nIf you like the Shadowrun series (boardgame or videogame) you will probably enjoy this game, but not as much as I would hope.\n\nTL;DR: Play "Shadowrun: Dragonfall" instead. If you've already played Dragonfall, then I'm not sure If I could recommend Hong Kong until it goes on sale.

Its up to you to figure out what happened to your foster father and maybe become a shadowrunner during the crossfire?\n\nThe story is really REALLY great, I just absolutly loved the characters, even though they have no voices, just reading their lines just gives me an impact.\n\nAlso there was really creepy final boss I encountered in the game, and it got more creepier by the 2/3rd time I faced it.\n\nThere are multiple endings to this game, and the one I chosen was really good, but I know it wasn't the only ending so more replayability there. 9.5/10\n\nGRAPHICS: I want to say that the graphics here are mostly still the same, though I will admit the characters have been improved upon slightly a bit.\n\nStill Its nice to see some areas that are inspired by real life Hong Kong and other cool art pieces and characters. 8.5/10\n\nGAMEPLAY: Again everything is mostly the same, but the combat UI is changed a bit to resemble the 1st ones unlike dragonfall.\n\nThe upgrading is changed slightly as you can now use cybernetics along with it like upgrading to lvl 1 cyberarm and further and further by your body lvling system.\n\nThe team lvling is still the same but its still good.\n\nEverything is slightly the same but slightly different too but its still awesome. 9/10\n\nVERDICT: Shadowrun: Hong Kong is a great 3rd installment in the Shadowrun Returns Series.\n\nIt doesn't really changed much, but its still a great turn-based RPG, has a great story, and lots of replayability. 9/10\n\nTLDR:\n\nPROS: Great story, good turn-based combat, lots of replayability, slightly improved character models.\nCONS: Really didn't changed much combat UI wise\n\nBuying Price: Full-price","August 22, 2015","true","18.0"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","15","25","0","2"

I also backed Shadowrun Returns and had about two hundred of hours on that game, beating it quite a few times. I have about one hundred hours on Dragonfall. I have played every video game based on shadowrun, including the FPS that other than races had little to do with Shadowrun. I picked up my first first edition books in June of 1990 from a little bookstore across from the docks in Port Angeles Washington. I own all the books, both role-playing materials and novels. I have run more games than I care to count and have been a fore-runner in the cries for more video games based on Shadowrun.\n\nThe first thing I am going to do is give rave reviews on the puzzle system for decking. It is interesting, provocative, and makes me feel as if I am achieving more than the original games afforded. I am looking forward to the evolution where a character can choose from a set of their own preferred visuals for the matrix, but I understand that incorporating those concepts are a long way off.\n\nI also like the new system where I can initiate combat if I choose too. It incorporates stealth elements to a video game based on a role-playing game where the use of stealth is essential to succeed. This is very challenging for a Turn-Based Strategy (TBS) game to reproduce.\n\nI like the TBS game style of play. I always have and always will. The character creation system is not far from the system in the game. I have concerns about the lack of cost correlation between race and points at creation. In the roleplaying game, you place points into the attributes before the racial changes take effect. It makes it worth it starting out to have an elf for the racial increases to quickness and charisma. I can tear apart any game based on a roleplaying game for the lack of ability to incorporate elements from the RPG correctly. It does not really degrade from the enjoyability of the game.\n\nThis game is fun with a great storyline. The amount of the information is large and if you are not a fan of reading text in the game you are going to have problems with this game. If you like a world rich with story and history, this game will make you very happy.\n\nThere are issues with glitches, but I only ran across one during my play through where it did not acknowledge my charisma correctly to afford me an opportunity in the tower. Glitches happen at release and take the time to resolve.\n\nGood Hunting chummers!","September 4, 2015","true","29.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

They fixed the issue of magical characters having no way to buy cyberware/bioware and the character building interface is much better.  Dialogue was much stronger than previous releases.  Unfortunately the game still suffers from some short comings which prevent it from delivering a true Shadowrun experience including:\n\n-- Negotiation with Fixers for run pay based on social skills is completely missing. The lack of an effective social system makes "Face" type characters non-existent.\n-- The main drive of Showdowrun is to make money to pay for lifestyle, and as a Runner is sucessful gain a better lifestyle with access to better accomodations and services.  This element is completley missing in this game.\n-- There is no stealth engine at all which is a critical aspect of Shadowrun.  Public Recognition is a non-factor.  Cleaning up signatures in the matrix and astral space is non-existant.\n-- There is no non-lethal system (gel rounds etc) and no penalty of any kind for giant body counts that would bring a megacorp down on a shadowrunner and end his career.\n-- There are no Fake Sins, social checks at border crossings, etc.\n-- The game is completely missing a legal engine.  Folks can walk around the mall with a tank gun and there is no consequence.  The game is missing the license system for weapons which renders highly concealable weapons, low calibur, and legal weapons worthless.  There is no point in developing skills or learning to use any but the biggest weapons.  This makes the game two-dimensional.\n-- The system of contacts is completely missing. One of the most enjoyable aspects of shadowrun is developing contacts and building their loyatly to leverage for future runs.\n-- There is no legwork in the game which makes non-combat builds superflous.\n\nHopefully the developer will slowly chip away at these deficienices as time and budgets allow.  Despite the above issues the game is still worth buying.","September 22, 2015","true","60.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SashPrime/recommended/346940/","SashPrime","YouAndMe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SashPrime/","293 products in account","The *BEST* Shadowrun game to date! Finally, just about everything I wanted Dragonfall and Returns to be: Hong Kong is. Dragonfall was a vast improvement over Returns: much better storyline - characters you can actually converse with - the ability to level-up your squad as you see fit. Hong Kong keeps those improvements, and then even more.\n\n+ Longer, more fleshed out storyline. Far more conversation options and a squad to actually care about (Gobbet <3). Feels like a vastly more immersive experience! Finally feels like there are some actual decisions to make in conversations with your squad, on missions, and even the shopkeepers around Hoei.\n\n+ Updated UI and the ability to not just send every pickup to stash: can finally swap items around and send them to a squadmate if you're inventory is full. Very helpful feature that's finally been added. Also, you can now enter combat mode before (some) fights break out, allowing you to properly position your squad instead of finding yourself clumped up for grenades/mage AOE before a fight even starts.\n\n+ Armor no longer gives stats (aside from armor rating) = You can buy anything to customize your looks rather than being locked into one particular armor set based on your class. Very cool! Can be a shaman and look like a decker if you really want. Personally, I just go with the ninja outfits from Shen... but that's just me.\n\n+ Classes finally feel more balanced. My main gripe of previous Shadowrun games was how much better any gunslinger felt over any other class. But more cyberware (!!!) and cyberweapons = Melee classes feel far more competent in Hong Kong than they ever have. And Mages finally get a VERY useful spell: Chain Lightning! IMO, just what mages needed to really feel powerful. A cheap (AP-wise), multi-target spell that deals good damage and AP damage, and isn't limited by a 2x2 square AOE.\n\n-/+ Updated Decking system: Still not sure about this. In some ways I enjoy it: it's different. But it's a little hampered by being a bit unresponsive and awkward at times. But at least it's no longer awkward battles in the matrix with Blitz..\n\n- Still some bugs present. Nothing game breaking, but some minor lingering issues that can be a bit bothersome. Sometimes can't interact with NPCs/items until I spam ALT. Once got stuck in a conversation with Duncan while simultaneously picking up an item during a mission and had to restart because I couldn't get out of it. Matrix sometimes feels unresponsive and awkward. But all-in-all: minor and doesn't affect my experience too much.\n\n** On the whole, absolutely love this game! It's been really fun playing all the Shadowrun games and seeing the progression. Returns was short, with a simplistic storyline and no real squad to care about. Dragonfall improved quite a bit on all fronts, and now Hong Kong improves on everything Dragonfall did over Returns: making for a much more fulfilling experience into the Shadowrun universe.\n\nWould highly recommend Shadowrun: Hong Kong - 9.5/10 game for sure! And an absolute must play if you're super into the Shadowrun series and have played the previous games.","March 3","true","58.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sentient_Toaster/recommended/346940/","Sentient_Toaster","Sentient_Toaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sentient_Toaster/","106 products in account","Game type -- Shadowrun's unusual setting (cyberpunk mixed with fantasy elements; entirely possible for a cybernetically augmented pistolero to be magically hasted by a shaman while dealing with hostile abominations from the astral plane) set in Hong Kong rather than Seattle.   Stats-based RPG, heavy emphasis on small-squad tactical combat, fixed-perspective isometric view, mostly-linear campaigns w/ a small number of non-random side missions available.  If you've played either previous Shadowrun Returns game, this will be pretty familiar territory for the most part.  Strictly single-player.\n\n\nPlayed through main and bonus campaign w/ an elf pistol-specialist street samurai with a fair side investment in charisma; typically had a rifle samurai, a decker, and a shaman in the party.  Don't expect to build a character who's good at everything and wielding the best of everything as resources can be fairly tight and this isn't a game with repeatable quests to farm (in the included campaigns, anyway; UGC can be as generous as the author feels like).\n\n\nPositives incl. -- true to setting (for a CRPG, anyway; can't really replicate a human GM's ability to incorporate and handle all the wacky ideas a player might have, so your options will always be limited), combines some tongue-in-cheek humor with a cast of suitably shady characters, revamped Matrix system (but can rely on a particular NPC decker if you don't build your player character as one) favoring stealth and timing, often multiple approaches to getting to the next stage.   Charisma isn't a complete dump stat, and knowledge of the right etiquettes can give you opportunities.  Still, do not expect to be able to avoid all bloodshed by any means; you will need to kill, and frequently.\n\n\nMixed -- There's Workshop support, but there seems to have been less modding done for it (notably few story UGC) than for Dragonfall or first SR iteration.  Combat mechanics are improved over original SR/Dragonfall with cover and positioning matter more, but it's still fairly light -- if you want a game where you can shoot an enemy on the floor above you through the ceilng or collapse a staircase with explosives, this isn't it.  You won't have to spend twenty minutes per turn meticulously planning, however, as if it's some hardcore complex military simulation with a gazillion things that you *could* do where many of 'em will eventually doom you from wasting too much time or too many resources or getting too many limbs removed from IEDs you didn't spot.   Complexity is a matter of taste.\n\n\nNegatives -- pretty short game (main and extended don't take all THAT long to play through once), story isn't anything to write home about over the long run.   One can also argue that it's not terribly innovative over Dragonfall, aside from the revamped Matrix sections.  There's also one bit of cyberware that's fairly sketchy, because once it shows up (and it shows up pretty frequently in the bonus campaign) grenades are drastically less useful, and that removes options from the board.","April 27","true","18.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

For hard-core cyberpunk fans (such as myself) I give this game a very strong recommendation.  For the general public or fans of the RPG genre I give it an extremely tepid recommendation.\n\nThere is something different about this game compared to its predecessors other than the setting.  There is perhaps no other way to explain it other than to say something about it feels awkward.\n\nLet's start by reviewing the elements of the game which are beyond reproach.  First is the music.  Like the previous games it is enjoyable yet unintrusive.  It reminds me strongly of the Mass Effect soundtrack.  This iteration, in a nod to the setting, has a subtle Asian tone which works well overall.\n\nThe art is similarly excellent, at least for the genre and style of game.  Like the music, the scenery was given subtle Asian flair and is overall very interesting.  Almost too interesting.  It makes you wish there was another zoom level to really allow you to sort of immerse yourself in the ambiance created by the art and music.  This almost-but-not-quite is a feeling I will come back to after addressing what is the best (and also the worst element of the game).\n\nThe writing.  Like in Dragonfall, the writing of Lead Writer Andrew McIntosh is thoughtful, gritty, and engaging.  I would buy cyberpunk novels from this gentleman.  At the beginning of the game you pick a sort of profession specialty which allows you to unlock certain dialogue options.  You can always see these options if not necessarily utilize them.  These options show you that the writers have dug down deep and wrote for these characters as if they themselves were playing a role-playing game.  Some of the dialogue, especially with Gaichu and Racter seem as if they were carefully researched.  This was obviously a labor of love.\n\nUnfortunately, I am going to suggest that the writing is actually TOO good.  Unlike the music, which is nice but sort of disappears into the background, you cannot ignore the writing.  If you ignore the writing, you ignore what is arguably the best aspect of the game.  While it is possible to complete the game without engaging in much superflous dialogue the end result is that you end of up playing a long series of combat events.  Tedious and boring combat events.\n\nThe combat is, and has been, the Achilles heel of this franchise.  The turn based system is overly simplistic (most likely so they can sell it by the boatload to casual tablet players) and not well balanced.  A well equipped group can simply run-and-gun through nearly every level.  The magic-using classes are mere novelties.  Unlike in many fantasy games,  the magic is simply not worth it in comparison to a trusty AK-47.  The Matrix was revamped as a stretch goal during the crowfunding and is much improved compared to its former iteration.  To HBS credit, the Matrix is now much more engaging and gives the player a sense of urgency  and danger commensurate with how the deckers actual speak of their time out of meat-space.  Ultimately, though it still feels like a mini-game rather than an integral part of daily cyberpunk life.  It was great of HBS to make the Matrix not suck but I feel they should have integrated it into other aspects of the game.  Perhaps place data access points in non-combat areas.  Have areas where deckers congretate in cyber-space.  Allow decking to unlock dialogue options or perhaps access to hidden areas or quests.  It is actually somewhat frustrating that the Matrix is much improved because it highlights its continued poor implementation and utilization within the game\n\nSo here is what ends up happening.  You end up engaging all of the extra dialogue choices because you want to extract more life out of the video game, but there is something different in the dialogue department from the previous games.   As the setting of this game is a fantastic imagining of China perhaps you will forgive me when I bestow the following moniker to the dialogue:  Shadowrun: The Great Wall of Text.\n\nThats right, the dialogue goes on and on and on.  Don't get me wrong, I love it.  It devour it.  Unfortunately, it is simply not comfortable to stare at a computer reading text for hours upon hours at a time.  I do not exagerate by saying there is perhaps 1.5 hours of optional dialogue for every 30 mins or so of combat.  It feels less like you are playing a game and more like you are reading a book with music and pretty (if zoomed out) graphics.  But the alternative, as mentioned before, is an unsatisfying series of tedious combat events.\n\nHere is where I think the game went wrong.  Not the writers, they should be awarded, commended, promoted.  The problem here is one of balance and the blame lies squarely with the game directors.  I think the directors realized the problem with the game:  it has no life to it.  Strip away the writing and it feels like an empty neon-lit diner at midnight.  Rather than attempting to imagine ways to inject life into the game they simply increased the volume of text.  Unfortunately, they leaned on the text to the breaking point and what was once a game became a book.\n\nI will not though, offer empty criticism without suggestions.  I think what the directors needed were scripted events thoughout the game.  Don't have people stand there in town waiting for you to come by and give them complementary psychological counseling sessions.  Have people mug someone as you walk by.  Have something happen if you loiter in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Some of the third-party mods created by the community for Dragonfall feel like they have more life than this game because of their scripting.  I have not myself delved into the scripting tools and ultimately the limitation of how much scripting can contribue to the immersion and depth of the game may be hard-coded and limited by the engine itself.  If this is the case, my advice to Harebrained Schemes is if they wish to make another game in this series, either revert to more tight productions like Returns and Dragonfall, or, create an entirely new engine for the next iteration allowing players to finally sink in and completely enjoy the intelligent and beautiful world they have created.\n\nThis seems like an awful lot of criticism for a game I've given a thumbs up to but I hope I help potential purchasers of this game go into their purchase eyes wide open.  I'd also love it somebody at HBS stumbled upon this and took some of this message to heart.  I, and thousands of others love what you do, but you have to potential to turn something alright into a future classic with a bit of work.","August 24, 2015","true","52.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tobsol/recommended/346940/","tobsol","Tobias Solem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tobsol/","321 products in account","Shadowrun: Hong Kong is a continuation of the Harebrained Schemes series of stories taking place in the Shadowrun universe. The predecessor, Dragonfall (Directors' Cut) was a gem in RPG-gaming and improved upon the original success. In spite of being a rather small developer, HBS has had some success in this series of games which is the reason why this is their third kickstarted game.\n\nShadowrun: Hong Kong starts on a story arc which is separate from the previous games, so you do not have to play those to get into this series, however if you are unfamiliar with this games series there are some precautions you should have to consider:\n\n1. The game has a lot of text in it\n2. While story-driven, there is no way to play it without entering many firefights and combat situations\n3. It has bugs\n\nThe first point is definitely something to consider for the modern gamer, almost all dialogue is written text without speech, just like in the old days of gaming. The advantage of course being that there are a lot of dialogue and interaction in the game which immerses you, with well-written sequences that create a lot of atmosphere. If you like to read, then this will be a pleasant experience - but if you don't have the patience for it, the game will be frustrating.\n\nThe second point is rather frustrating for a role player, while you will meet characters that are prone to combat that will aid you, there simply is no easy way to say this: You will have to fight. If you don't like combat, Shadowrun isn't for you. Shadowrunners are essentially mercenaries hired to do mostly combat runs. You will be able to gain advantages through dialogue and hacking and such, but there is no way to complete this game without long tactical combat scenes.\n\nAnd to the last, third, and possibly MOST aggravating issue with the game, its bugs. HBS has made three games and all of them suffer from similar bugs. Some of which completely block you off from doing certain areas because there is a problem with some trigger, or because of a general "combat won't end"-bug. On top of this there are glitches where certain weapons won't show, and it looks like your character is shooting an air rifle (á la air guitar) and other things (like noxious clouds being immensely overpowered in the final chapter of the game). In some cases you can't do anything but reload the game and take a different route, in other cases you can try and press escape, and resume the game, click wildly, press tab, and sometimes you will be able to get back to "normality". This is a rather huge caveat though, HBS has many bugs from the original game still in their code. This is simply sloppy. I backed the game, and now am hesitant to do it again due to lack of playtesting and bugfixing.\n\n\nShadowrun: Hong Kong is still a very much enjoyable RPG-experience that gives you many decisions and options that tread the grey areas of morality and sometimes delving into complete chaos and amorality. The storyline is well written without going cliché on you, and manages to surprise you at times. For the prize, it is a very enjoyable game, but in spite of playing it through the weekend I felt it was short, and that interesting characters could have had more development, and that some scenarios could have been fleshed out more - add the bugs on top of this and it is a flawed gem, but still a gem indeed.","August 23, 2015","true","54.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

SR:HK has made some pretty great improvements to the series, most notably the matrix. They have made it more of a stealth focused section, with puzzles to break into things. It's a nice refreshing change to what it used to be. The maps seem way bigger, and the game has some pretty fun and exciting missions. Forewarning to anyone who's never played the previous games, or isn't a fan of reading, this game is very heavy on dialogue. I personally enjoy it, it provides more layers to the story. I can see how it might push people away however. Overall, I'd rate this game on par with Dragonfall. It's certinally better than Returns.","August 23, 2015","true","26.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I played the game immediately on its release, and it still had a few very minor issues (for instance, the wrong character's portrait being displayed during a conversation involving multiple people, or the player's name failing to display, or a dead NPC available for selection for one fight, or an object changing name- betraying loose ends not quite tied up).  But it was bug free and smooth gameplay for me, even smoother than the previous two games:  Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall.  As in the two previous games, the atmosphere was convincing, immersive, creepy, and exciting.  And the storyline presented choices that felt important, distinctly different, and complex.  Finally, the dialogue was entertaining and well-written.  This is an old-school game; it would have been cutting edge in 2005 and run of the mill in 2010 for graphics and mechanics.  In 2015 it feels slightly homespun.  But the gameplay and storyline more than outweigh this minor defect.","August 25, 2015","true","31.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

That is really nice approach. New cbyerware instalation table brings the game even closer to tabletop experience, and that means huge bonus for us fanboys :)\nGeneraly speaking, it is quite mature game for players, who want deep personal storyline, good cultural a nd setting feeling and IMO also multi-vector approach, that allows you to be able to chose your own path. Even different character concepts are aluring, and I it would be fun to re-play with different character too.\nGood job, HBS.\n\n\nP.S.: Is this enought, RC?

Many of us are very supportive of Harebrained Schemes efforts, especially after the terrific "Shadowrun: Dragonfall." Unfortunately, most of the positive votes are unrealistic assessments of a very mediocre, tedious, and uninspired game. There are many reasons Shadowrun: Hong Kong is a failure of an RPG, many of them preventable by the developers.\n\nFirst, the re-work of the Matrix is difficult to comprehend. How did this get past Quality Control? Where were the people inside the company who had the common sense to say "HEY, GUYS, THIS IS REALLY TERRIBLE!" The Matrix is a total, absolute, utter failure of both concept and game testing. It is thoroughly tedious, unenjoyable, and stupid. I rarely use the word "stupid" because it's vague unless you mean something is the result of incompetence. The Matrix in SR:HK is stupid. You are essentially playing a game of Pac-Man, in real time, where ICs play the role of the ghosts. If your tracing gets to high, well, you know what happens in Dragonfall, right? At any rate, they followed up this absolute disaster of a design with a game of Simon (you know, the extremely lame memory game?) to resolve the security around data nodes. Pac-Man and Simon. That was the idea behind the Matrix in SR:HK. A truly disgraceful product.\n\nSecond, the BUGS. What the hell happened here? You need to keep a large amount of saves because the possibility of saves failing to re-load during certain missions is quite high. During the museum heist, Rooster kidnapping, and Sinking Ship missions my save files would cease to re-load after a certain point in the mission. I would have to go back to the start of the level, or at least the last functioning save, and get through the whole mission without saving. The Sinking Ship deserves a trophy of its own for not working. If you look at game reviews right after release, you'll notice that the mission would get stuck for all sorts of reasons. Well, it still happens. Once you go down to the lower levels, two things will happen: one, the game will bug out and your character will stop responding to your cursor clicks, and you can't even scroll the screen. Second, the couple that leads you to the lower levels will 1) get stuck walking back and forth during the event, or 2) accidentally set off the event WHILE YOU'RE IN ANOTHER ROOM LOCKED BEHIND THEM. In both scenarios, the game cannot progress. On top of that, every rat encounter has the possibility of the rats getting stuck just like the couple.\n\nAnother bug I experienced was loaning a special pistol encountered during a mission to one of my team members. The weapon simply disappeared forever after the mission. Annoying to game breaking stuff abounds.\n\nLast, the overall story writing is flimsy compared to Dragonfall. Hong Kong is full of cliches, predictable plot twists, unintendedly funny characters, and seemingly meaningless conversations.\n\nThere's a lot of potential in SR:HK if it gets a major reworking like Dragonfall did, although Dragonfall was already a great game when it received the star treatment. As it stands, I have to rate Hong Kong as the worst of the series by a longshot. The Matrix alone is a barrier to ever replaying the game, as no one in their right mind would want to replay Pac-Man and Simon that takes 3-5 minutes per re-load, depending on the mission.\n\nGotta say, usually love the stuff this developer puts out. SR:HK is a major disappointment, I don't recommend anyone spending money on this train wreck.","November 29, 2015","false","65.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

Pretty much. The most notable changes being the revamped Matrix, which is awesome. Decking feels much less like IRL combat. There's also a bunch of new cyberware. More variety there is definitley a good thing. I decided to roll my street samurai with a cyber-whip. Best weapon. The story is really good, and feels like it has a lot more content than Dragonfall, albiet because they developed Hong Kong as a standlone title, instead of an add-on to Shadowrun Returns. Awesome soundtrack too.\n\nI loved Dragonfall. I loved this.

The new Matrix gameplay is fun and can be actually challenging, the characters are deep and realized as usual, and the final sequences where all the mysteries of the game start to get wrapped up are engaging.\n\nGameplay\nIf you've played a Shadowrun game before, you should know what to expect. Isometric point-and-click, turn-based combat, it's all pretty consistent, although throughout several points I found that the combat dragged on for some encounters far more than was necessary. Also, what's up with 70%+ to hit, I take three shots, all three miss. I understand that sometimes these things happen occasionally, but it's happened to me several times now. Normally I wouldn't nitpick on this, but because the previous two Shadowrun games didn't have this problem for me, I'm just a little disappointed with this. Other than that, the gameplay is still solid, with a new stealth+puzzle Matrix for deckers to jack into.\n\nStory\nYou are invited to Hong Kong by your foster father, who wants to speak to you on a matter of utmost importance. However, both parties, you and your brother, Duncan, and your foster father, Raymond, are ambushed. The story unfolds from here as you discover that you have an entire city full of police out for your head, as well as strange dreams plaguing your sleep. The characters that accompany you on this journey are fleshed out and realized, and it's well worth talking to them between missions. However, if you hate reading, you will definitely miss out on the best parts of the game. It's not a game that you should always go with the 'attack' option. There is a lot of dialogue in this game, I like that, but be warned. The previous two games have less dialogue, which can be either good or bad.\n\nGraphics, Atmosphere, Sound\nGraphics are better than from last time, walking around Heoi (your home-base area) it is all very well done, with the graphics letting Harebrained Schemes get the most out of their environments and characters.\nThe atmosphere, is, as usual, impeccable. The game really draws you in, with detailed descriptions, awesome character portraits, interesting characters, usage of Chinese magics such as Qi and Feng Shui, and every environment feels just that *bit* different, and that's a good thing.\nThe sound is, again, still awesome. With gunfire, splatters of blood, exploding of heads with critical kills, and another epic soundtrack to accompany the game, it's up high on the scale of 'what's great about this game'. My favorite tracks are Bad Qi, DeckCon, The Walled City and Welcome to the Grid.\n\nAres!!!\nThis was easily the most frustrating moment in the game, and I'd like to outline it for anyone who is looking to buy this game. The mission called 'Misdirection' in which you have to steal from an Ares corporation and dodge Knight Errant Soldiers, has an infuriating bug if you take along Racter. You have to find a keycard to open a safe, and, on the lab level, be sure not to trip the Matrix alarms or bring in extra security *before* you reach the other Runners. If that happens, a dialogue will be missed and you won't receive the keycard. Unfortunately I didn't realize that the keycard couldn't be gained after fighting off extra security, so after completing that long battle I realized I had to start the entire mission again. You have been warned, there may be other glitches like this throughout the game.\n\nConclusion\nA fun, detailed, immersive game that, although it has it's problems with gameplay and glitches, I'll still let it go because I found myself enjoying the game more than I was hating on it. If you are looking for one Shadowrun, buy Dragonfall, but if you are looking for another Shadowrun adventure, buy this, just acknowledge that there will be some problems. But, after all, what game doesn't?\n\n","October 7, 2015","true","22.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In case with SR HK - it was something new and about as for my personal cyberpunk style resonator - it was about at about 8-9 dB in comparison with first 2 parts - 30-40 dB (Welcome to the Sixth World; Double Cross; Bloodhounds; Too Quiet etc.). But the thing is that irrespectively of SR HK ost corresponding the frequency of my attitude resonator, it was absolutely and neatly corresponding with surrounding atmosphere, mystery of the plot, not mentioning rather astonishing mixture of classical chinese music tones with beats and electronic sounds. All in all - it was totally different, but still awesome and 'groovy' (Gee..'the Walled City' and 'Grendle' as well as matrix grid osts are on repeat for 2 days already *_*)\n\n- Matrix grid gameplay. Was defintely pleased with extensive progress in this part of gameplay. Assuming that additional difficulties - thus boosting gameplay interest and mindwork - were applied. I'd REALLY LOVE to see some code riddles (WHAT AN AWESOMENESS IT'D BE IF IT WOULD BE ASSEMBLER *_* or prolly some kind of mixture!!) if there will be new episodes telling us about new mysteries of Sixth World Dilemmas. ABSOLUTELY.LOVE.DECKERS. (or to be more precise a fine mixture of diplomat capable of hacking networks and manipulating drones).\n\n- Renewed warfare as well as characters' abilities that allow you to be lethaly brutal as well as merciful pacifist (I've picked the latter). There are even some runs that are opted for pure stealth *_*\n\nBut generally:\nI love the plot. It actually corresponds well with global agenda that continues to strike the Sixth World each time from another side.\nI love the team. Their personalities and storylines were thoroughly worked out and thought through.\nI love the gameplay and multiple ways of conflict reasoning. Well, that actually is true about all the episodes.","May 18","true","98.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It provides rich roleplaying options as well- both on mechanical and social levels of interaction with the game world.\n\nMechanically SR: HK shows a lot of improvement, in comparison to earlier games- while the combat is still slow and boring, most missions are designed in a way that allows you to minimize playtime spent fighting, if not outright skip most of the fights.\n\nFirst hour or so feels a bit off-putting, with slow and downright boring exposition, but after that the story picks up and the fun begins.\n\nSo, to summarize :\n\nGood story\nAmazing characters\nNice writing\nBoring fights\nSlow first hour\n\nThe bonus campaign consists of 4 missions and holds up to the original game (if just barely), by providing a definitive ending to the story.\n\nSo, if you re into CRPGs, then do yourself a favor and play both SR: HK and Dragonfall- they are worth it.

The setting is to me also much more interesting than Berlin in Dragonfall and the story is to me, more interesting. The hacking is changed up and this is a bit annoying but you get used to it. Although a big problem is the bugs. It is still only a few months old this game but it got some bugs that can be game breaking and sometimes forced me to do reloads, like stuck in menus, NPCs blocking the road or me having to reload to grenade kill bugged up NPCs who somehow turned loyal to me when I dominated it's spirit summon.\n\nBut beside the problems this is probably, in my opinion! The best Shadowrun game made by Harebrain. There is supposedly a mini-campaign coming aswell to Shadowrun : Hong Kong which will be free for kickstarter backers. No regrets in finishing this "trilogy" of content. Together they end up around 40-50 hours if you play Returns, Dragonfall and Hong Kong and I say it is well worth it. I just hope they fix those bugs in Hong Kong and continue on with new stories. Cause this setting is interesting and very fiting for turn based rpgs. The odd mix sci-fi-fantasy-cyber punk is pretty damn cool to, it is unique even if it's an old setting.  I give it a 7,5 out of 10.

I thought the city environments were in general fresh and compelling, SR Dragonfall by contrast had more beautiful environments overall, but it's home town was forgettable, it wasn't funny and amusing like Hong Kong. The focus Harebrained made on making the hometown lively and intriguing was evident and welcome.\n\nI found early parts of the story to be a bit overly circumstantial, but it only serves to build up the plot and in the end it all wraps up rather nicely.\n\nI'll point out a silly yet interesting minor detail in the overall polish the game has that I liked (and unfortunately the programmers and music artist might never hear it said), I love that the music now changes with the tide of the battle.

YES.\n\nSo far, Harebrained Schemes seems to have capitalized on Dragonfall's gameplay improvements while improving certain frustrations. Decking has been overhauled both visually and in terms of gameplay. It adds a stealth element that lends a much-needed element of unpredictability. Outside the matrix, you can play with new skills and weapons and sweet gadgets. The Karma system is now more UI friendly. (Still wish they didn't use the word "Intelligence" for tech skills - I resent the notion that my wiseass shaman elf is not intelligent just because she doesn't know how to deck.) They seem to have removed the Street etiquette as well, which makes sense with Hong Kong's narrative and frees more charismatic players to dabble in etiquettes they might not have tried before. (In Dragonfall, the distinctions between Street, Shadowrunner, and Gang etiquettes always seemed a bit tenuous to me.)\n\nBut is the story as interesting as Dragonfall? Yep. Maybe more. I need to finish it first - and I feel compelled to finish it. The narrative is high-strung with urgency. It seems to rely on the same framework as Dragonfall (go on missions to raise money in order to find Missing Person X and uncover mystery along the way), but this is forgivable. If it ain't broke . . .\n\nMy final comment: The art team on this one deserves praise and hugs and cookies sent to the office. Their work has improved since Dragonfall. The city of Hong Kong drips with atmosphere and character, and visual environments seem to correspond more convincingly with the game's narrative descriptions. (The same goes for the character models themselves. A gripe I had about Dragonfall was that character models tended to look nothing like their avatars.)\n\nKudos, Harebrainers.

I am 15 hours into the game and would be surprised if I have spent < 10 of those 15 hours reading essentially static text boxes of dialogue that have virtually no impact on the characters, world, or gameplay.\n\nThere's an old saying in the film and TV industry:  "Show. Don't Tell."  Essentially this is saying that it's incredibly lazy and boring to just sit there and explain the plot and character motivations to the viewer.  In film and TV (and games), you have the advantage of a medium that can _show_ the users what is going on, and let the viewers immerse themselves and figure out what to feel on their own--SO USE IT.  In games, I'd even go one step further and update the saying to be:  "Play.  Don't Tell _or_ Show."\n\nRegardless, this game fails the "Show.  Don't Tell." rule worse than any game I've ever ever played.\n\nThe sad thing is that the writing is excellent in my opinion.  I would consider reading this if it were an actual novel.

In fact, I was so excited about this game, I pre-purchased it (yeah, the only one of my 308 video games that I've pre-purchased).  The verdict:  Well, this game has the potential to be great.  But it's crippled by a few major issues.  I want to believe that these issues will be addressed by the studio/publisher so that I can happily change this rating to the glowing "thumbs up" that I've rated their previous two titles!  But, as it stands right now, this is the situation with this game:\n\nFirst, the pros:\n--Like the first two games ("Returns" and "Dragonfall") this game has a wonderful atmosphere/setting.\n--Stat tree has been revised, for the better.\n--Another good story.  The story is on par with "Returns", in my opinion.\n--Some of the improvments to the Matrix are a plus, such as the aesthetics and the clearer distinction between white IC and black IC.  However, some of the changes were definitely NOT for the better (see below).\n--Nice soundtrack.\n\nAnd now, the cons:\n--The game is loaded with bugs and flaws.  For example, the interactable objects in the environment work great...except when they don't work at all.\n--There seems to be fewer interactables than in "Dragonfall".  Like "Returns", the environment seems like it's more for looks.\n--The dialogue boxes are poorly proofread and don't always flow properly.  Sometimes a character will answer a question that wasn't asked.  Sometimes the same dialogue choice will appear twice among the list of choices.\n--The story is really stingy with rewards.  I completed all the missions successfully, even making sure not to miss any of the optional objectives and I still finished the game with crappy mid-range gear and almost no cybernetics...and I barely afforded that.  The game does reward you with $5,000 nuyen during the epilogue when, of course, you have no use for the money (I thought that decision was rather lame.).  Half the fun is pulling off perfect runs so you can reap the rewards and build a powerful character.  However, the stingyness of the game with it's story rewards could be viewed as a challege of mission completion on a frugal budget, and I guess that would be do-able if it wasn't for...\n-- ...yup, another bug.  And this one is almost game breaking.  The inventory and trade system is badly glitched.  Often you'll buy equippment from vendors and they take your nuyen (in-game currency) and don't give you the merch!!!  Or, you get the merch but it disappears from your inventory shortly thereafter, never to appear again.  Even gear you already owned sometimes randomly disappears!  And this doesn't just happen when buying -- the same problem crops up when selling.  For example, I tried to sell a $1,000 smartlink shotgun to a vendor and the item disappeared...but I never got paid for the sale.  So, coupled with the stingy story rewards, the fact that this glitch constantly rips you off makes it almost impossible to properly equip your character by late game missions.\n--Hacking in the Matrix is essentially a hyper-irritating, repetitve game of "Simon Says".  I mean, really?  That's the best they could come up with?!?  It's enough to offset the improvements they've made to decking in this installment.  The Watcher IC are annoying as well since line-of-sight often makes it difficult to determine their patrol routes.\n--Items in game don't display their effects...or heck, I dunno, maybe they don't work at all.  For example, your character will don an armored vest but, according to your stats, you're not wearing it at all!  You don't gain the benefit of the expensive armor you just purchased.  Wow, it's that nice?  That is only one example, but you get the idea.\n\nAnyway, this game has the potential to be AWESOME, once it's heavily patched.  Until then, don't say I didn't warn you.","August 27, 2015","false","55.4"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","13","23","2","0"

Heck, I even loved the SNES Shadowrun - which is probably my favorite, actually.\n\nI haven't played the game super long at this point, but am definitely towards the early mid range in terms of completing content. But omg HK's story is soooo boring. Dialogue goes on WAY too long. I may have made a bad decision in terms of deciding on which missions to take on first, but there is no indication that it would be super chatty mission vs one that actually has fighting in it. In fact, I don't even know for sure if missions with less dialogue and more action (of some variety, e.g. fighting, matrix runs, puzzle/problem solving objectives...) even exist.\n\nThe backstory of the characters is not particularly interesting, either. The case of characters are cool in overall concept but are kinda bland overall. You're supposed to even care about your foster father's disappearance, but the game does not even get you to 'care' about this seemingly random person. So why would I care about finding him? It's just like that with most of the characters...there are moments of vulnerability but there's no real depth yet, no conflict among team members, or anything even close to what the last two iterations have done in terms of building strong, memorable and lovable personalities.\n\nI like that they beefed up the weaponry, the Matrix changes, and carrying some upgrades from SRDF:DC with the character development.\n\nI'm going to keep trying to push this on, but I sincerely hope it picks up or I will never finish this game.

A stealth system has now been implemented with the player having the ability to avoid detection from patrolling defense programs. Accessing nodes containing information now requires the decker to participate in a mini-game of sorts that involves playing a game of “simon says” with the number pad, and matching an encrypted password that is easier to find depending on how well the decker performed in the previous mini-game. Failure in either the sneaking or the mini-game results in the decker being easier to track in the system, filling up the system trace meter. Getting discovered by a patrol forces you to fight it, and there are still defense programs in certain parts of the Matrix that will automatically attack you when entering an area. While the movement controls aren’t particularly adequate to perform these stealth sections, it is still more than doable. Personally, I’m glad that the Matrix finally feels like its own component and not a re-hash of what’s already in the game.

Each game also keep improving, this one really giving a lot of required engine improvement. Each game also show you different part of the Shadowrun universe so it's a good idea to start with the first but they can be enjoyed in any order.\n\nHong Kong is also really full of dialogue and text to read but you can skip most. I probably spent half my 20 hours in the hub interacting with the many npcs there. This game give a lot of information on the universe and different part of the world.\n\nFor those that played the previous games, you can now trade between your party member when you want, you can even loan them equipment and not only consumables. You can even pick between two "perks" for them when you advance the story that gives them interesting abilities. They also were my favorite of the three games, really interesting party members this time around.\n\nI feel there is also more non-violent option this time around, I was able to do the first run without any fight because I had the right etiquettes and attributes. Overall the runs were really varied and interesting with usually a few options how to do them.\n\nThe Matrix needed an update and they finally did it. It might not be an improvement for everyone but personally I really like what they did. It's now kind of two real-time puzzle minigames instead of a big battle. But when you fail and get found it can turn into the old fight.\n\nThe Hong Kong area is also really beautiful, they really pushed those isometric graphics to the max.

Otherwise, Hong Kong is a good addition to the series.\n\nI think my experience with Hong Kong suffered a little from playing it immediately after finishing the amazing Dragonfall.  Having to exist in the shadow of the near perfect second game in the series it suffers a bit.  The characters, with a few exceptions, just didn't pop like the memorable party members and NPCs in Dragonfall. I suppose it's unfair of me to think so when I immediately assigned the new party names like "Not Glory" and "Not Billy Idol Punk Rocker Shaman dude".  Hell, I even missed Blitz.  The two exceptions are the Red Samurai Ghoul you can pick up and the Russian Rigger Guy.  I never really felt and interest in learning much about the NPC denizens of Hong Kong.\n\nDragonfall allowed you to make tough choices that resonated into the ending of the game (and beyond).  In contrast, Hong Kong seems to be far more linear with little variation in how you handle the overall campaign.  While the individual Shadowruns in Hong Kong are very well done and interesting with different set pieces, you never really are afforded the same level of choice you had in the previous game (i.e. walking away from Lofwyr and SK or not).  I would have loved the choice to walk away at the end and go back to Seattle.\n\nFinally, the conclusion to Hong Kong ends with a bit of a wimper when the game falls into the old trope of killing the same boss over and over (and over) again until it finally relents.  My party members made note to tell me at the very last that I had never really taken the time to talk to them.  Which I suppose is telling in and of itself.\n\nDespite not living up to the former game Hong Kong is still a very good squad tactics game.  If you have already played Dragonfall and are looking for a new flavor then you can't really go wrong with Hong Kong.","September 25, 2015","true","31.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's extra special for me because HK is my home. Every time I hear the MTR announcement the rush of pride that washes over me is quite priceless.\n\nAlthough I don't know if I'd give it the same high praise as this review. It feels more like gradual improvements rather than a leap forward. The most improvement for me was the new character models, which is minor enough but not necessarily a bad thing. The writing isn't bad but Dragonfall still takes the cake. Again because I am from HK, the little inaccuracies and stereotypes that snuck into the game irks me more than most people (the Walled City isn't even anywhere close to water!).\n\nThere's not a lot game-changing elements, only minor tweaks. The core gameplay was never particularly great nor broken so I'm not suggesting it warranted an overhaul (Shadowrun was always clunky on pencil and paper anyway). Some substantial new elements like sub races or gear customization would have been nice.\n\nI got a great package out of Kickstarter. And people who played neither Shadowrun nor Dragonfall will get a steal for their money. But if you somehow missed the Kickstarter (shame on you!) and played Dragonfall, I'm not sure if there's enough progression from there to warrant the price of a full game.

Additionally, the overall pacing, length and cohesiveness of the story weren't nearly as strong as they could've been, and I think this is where the majority of complaints about the plot stem from. Not necessarily that the plot was bad per se, but that because of its awry execution, people were not able to fully appreciate it.\n\nNonetheless, there were still a number of noticeable improvements made to the actual gameplay and the music was quite stellar too, especially the main menu theme. All in all, I believe people are having a difficult time judging HK objectively due to their rose coloured lens tinting their experience with DF.\n\nPersonally, I find the biggest flaw with HK not to be how badly ( or well ) it sizes up with DF, but with how it seemingly passed up on a lot of easy/simple potential to improve the game.\n\nUltimately, if you consider their budget, the development time frame and the size of their team, you really can't fault them...as they need to cover their bases financially first and foremost, as a smaller independent studio.\n\nHBS' hard work has paid off all the same, and their surging fame and popularity can be witnessed in how quickly their recent kickstarter gathered steam. I wish them all the best, for so long as they remain passionate and grounded in their work, a successful HBS means a successful Shadowrun series.\n\nAnd from what we've seen and what we know, HBS is very much down to earth and in touch with their community.\n\nNow, enough of this doom and gloom...GIVE ME THE NEXT SHADOWRUN ALREADY\n\nEdit: Whatever discontent I had with the base SR:HK game have been completely dispelled by the Shadows of Hong Kong mini campaign, and transforms SR:HK into the clear better as compared to SR:DF.\n\nThis, here, is the complete Shadowrow experience, and the feels this game gives you by the end, all the personal and tough choices you will have to make throughout, the blurred lines of morality and the shades of grey, all of them resound with you.

I would've paid 50% more for a version with voice acting.\n\nThe AI can still be considered stupid, odd or buggy at times:\n\n- I've cornered a foe, who decides to use his "strip armor" spell on my rigger who's by far the furthest away avoiding combat.\n\n- The enemy tries several times to toss a grenade at Duncan even though he has the ability to toss it back (every time).\n\n- A foe will make a move towards my team, but then instead of attacking, he moves back into cover, clearly wasting action points, as the direct route to that cover was shorter.\n\nAnd in the just plain silly category, I discovered that my summoned Rat Devil spirit could operate a computer during combat. Judging by it's avatar it really shouldn't have a clue what its doing :)\n\nThe extended version I bought at 50% off has a quite lengthy, high quality bonus campaign included, bringing my total playtime to 20 hours.\n\nUnlike Dragonfall DC, I found Hong Kong to be very easy on normal difficulty, and I was only challenged in the end fight in the bonus campaign, until I realized I was missing an item that gives you control of a powerful spider tank.\n\nBottom line - if you just cannot get enough of Shadowrun, or you're a fan of the genre, but haven't tried the previous Shadowrun games, then this is a recommended purchase even at full price - especially if you don't mind reading A LOT. If you've recently played a Shadowrun game and felt it was a okay/good experience, there's no reason to throw money at Hong Kong - it's fundamentally more of the same.\n\n76%","February 23","true","20.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you were to go back, you wouldn't get that sensation you get from when you, say, go back and play Grand Theft Auto III and try to jump out of a moving car (remember that? sucked ♥♥♥ didn't it!), its perfectly fine, you can play these in any order you want.\n\nAs for the story, I'll give this one a couple points above Dragonfall but honestly not by an awful lot, they're both good and both take place in very different yet interesting places, Returns being in Seattle, Dragonfall in Berlin and Hong Kong in.....yeah, and each has VERY different politics and mindsets.  One thing I would point out, if you dunno jack about Shadowrun (and I didn't before I played Returns), you should play Dragonfall before Hong Kong, so that you're not spending the whole game coming to grips with the really strange cyber-fantasy world you're in and all the terminology that goes along with it, Returns was a great primer in that regard.  None of the games really offer you a hand-holding introduction into the setting except perhaps Returns (kinda?), so unless you feel like reading a lot of unwieldy wiki articles I would advise putting some time into that - its cheap - or Dragonfall before buying Hong Kong =)\n\nAll of that said, Dragonfall seems to have the most user-created content, in particular the Shadowrun Unlimited mod, so in terms of bang-for-buck, I'd go there. Hopefully some of those user-campaigns get ported up to HK, but if not then not a huge loss since again the older games are easy to go back to.","June 6","true","24.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The fights are generally quite short, but some of them can be lethal if you get caught unawares... so about right for a gun fight then.\n\nThere is a lot of dialogue and it can be a bit overfacing early on, as these total strangers start with their wall o text life stories, but it's worth sticking with and adds to the whole RPG experience type thing and can open up side quests for some of your crew.  Which leads me to the NPCs, very well written, same sort of quality as Dragonfall's NPCs, but DIFFERENT, just as your relationship with Fixer and introduction to the team is different.  Gobbet is, IMO, probably as memorable as Minsc from Baldurs Gate and I can't think of a weak link in the team - all of them bring something to a fight and all of them are pretty well written and usually have things to say on missions, so it's worth doing additional playthroughs with a different PC types to get different NPC input.\n\nThe ending feels more Shadowrun-like than either of the previous two - no matter what you choose to do, the world rolls on regardless and indifferent.\n\nTL:DR version\nis as good as Dragonfall, if not better.  100% achievement easier than Dragonfall by far.","September 23, 2015","true","149.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I really enjoyed the previous two games, Returns and Dragonfall, so I've been looking forward to playing Hong Kong ever since it was announced, and I'm pleased to say that Hong Kong lived up to my expectations.\n\nThe story is excellent. Your character has received a mysterious message from your foster-father, indicating that he's in trouble and asking for your help. After arriving in Hong Kong, you get dragged into a massive conspiracy involving organised crime, corporate espionage and supernatural wierdness. There are lots of interesting characters and the dialogue is well written.\n\nThe turn based combat system is pretty much the same as previous games. You have a team of 4 characters, and each round they spend action points to move, attack (with guns, melee or magic) or use items such as medkits and grenades. Its a system that I really like because there's a lot of tactical depth, especially now that you can customise your companions' abilities when they level up (a feature that was also added to the director's cut of Dragonfall).\n\nMost missions are designed to allow non combat skills to be useful, for example using dialogue options to avoid fighting guards, or hacking a computer to unlock a door.\n\nThe biggest new feature for Hong Kong is the improved matrix system. There's more of a stealth element - some enemies patrol along a set path and they won't attack until you enter their vision cone, so if you're careful you can avoid them. And hacking nodes within the matrix is now a two part mini-game involving remembering sequences of numbers and symbols.\n\nMy only disappointment is the continued lack of voice acting. It didn't spoil my enjoyment of the game, but its something that I would like to see added if there's a fourth Shadowrun, because I think it would elevate a good game into a great game.\n\nIt took me 20 hours to finish the main story and I think I completed all the side quests as well. I didn't encounter any bugs or crashes. I also want to say that the music is pretty good and matches the oriental theme.\n\nOverall Hong Kong is a really good game, fans of the series will certainly enjoy it, and its worth a full price purchase. The story is not connected to the previous games, so if you're new to Shadowrun, you could choose to play the games in any order.","September 29, 2015","true","20.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Combat runs smoother than before, and is more engaging, introducing few nifty little new mechanics to the turn-based battle. Matrix is revamped for the better, offering more immersive experience of gliding through shadow world of information that runs at the very core of Shadowrun. From technical standpoint, it seems to run better and more reliably than earlier releases as well.\n\nIf you liked either of the earlier titles, I can safely vouch on the life of my firstborn that you will like this one too. For any newcomers to the franchise or the game series, this is, if not the ideal, so far the best entry point storywise to the world.\n\nFull reviewFirst, let me state that I will not shy away from occasional spoiler if review so demands. Secondly, the game reviewed is Deluxe Edition, which may or may not be reflected in the content. Thirdly, bulk of review is on the writing.\n\nThe first thing to highlight from this game is the quality of writing. It runs a much more self-contained narrative than its predecessors, thus rewarding it the “newbie friendly” seal offered to it a paragraph or so above this one. Where Returns was fairly inaccessible due to lore-heaviness that reminds me of titles such as Dragon Age:Origins and certain JRPG approaches that left me wanting a codex as a newly introduced participant in the events, Hong Kong has managed to strike a balance between lore and narrative: Even without knowing a thing about Flux state, Seattle, Tir, dragons, or Robert N. Charrette, you as a protagonist still have easily definable purpose (save yourself and your adopted father), complex relationship with your brother (slowly revealed in very natural dialogue and built by your decisions), and life as you make it in the city of Heoi and rest of Hong Kong while pursuing the said purpose.\n\nObviously a mammoth world spawning few DM core rule books will be reflected in any story set in it, but this time it is like a beautiful set piece draping around the narrative, further softened by intelligent references to modern day events and politics. This could have been a merely annoying wink aimed to stroke the egos of clammy neck-bearded armchair generals of game community, still weeping the loss of uniqueness as established by the first Fallout game, but instead they manage to serve as a pathway for original scifi thought-experiments aimed to describe possible futures of technology. While Shadowrun still stands with its chrome covered feet solely planted in contemporary sci-fantasy soil, it is small touches such as discussion of Euro Wars and Russian politics that distill the old school scifi into mix, elevating experience that could have been, completely legitimate, bare entertainment into something more.\n\nThe NPCs are more complex than seen before, relying, if not less, on stereotypes, different and by their own right interesting stereotypes. By giving character such as disgraced Red Samurai a personality that runs against the expected redemption arc, the game is playing player expectations resulting in refreshing take on the tropes of the industry. Not perhaps the most novel of ways, but much appreciated in its execution, which is both serious enough to not result in tiring fourth-wall breaking hipster winks, but not too serious. Same can be said about entire game, it avoids both pitfalls that could potentially ruin it: overbearing pathos and crippling self-awareness.\n\nFinal point about writing is a double edged sword: the interactions and reactions of the protagonist are more varied than before, allowing more free headcanon building than earlier. However, it is somewhat obvious it is just that, written (and mostly typo free) representation of how the player portrays their character inside their mind. I doubt most dialogue choices actually change anything in the game, merely the way I think about it. And even then, it is corralling the character into certain mold. For me this is enough, the illusion of choice is oftentimes as good as actual choice. However, keep in mind I say this having played 500 hours of Crusader Kings II with most elaborate narratives running inside my mind.\n\nThere is not much to say about actual gameplay, as it remains largely unchanged from Dragonfall. You point, you click, and move about in a beautiful handpainted isometric world. Your team has turns, enemy team has turns. Occasionally someone does damage. For me it is a plus, since I have enjoyed the fights since first installment. There are some novel elements, such as Gaichu’s sword styles or Koschei’s melee, but whether this is refreshing enough for those who want novelties, I cannot say. The battles do run more smoothly though, with less waiting and faster animation.\n\nThe major revamp of the game is that of Matrix, and despite resounding grumbling heard across interwebs, I argue it is an excellent revamp. You have to time yourself to glide through watcher IC occupied systems unseen, and use your memory and reflexes to hack gates to access information you need. For the first time, the Matrix provides some challenge and immersion.\n\nAs conclusion, Shadowrun: HK is a very good game. Due to its smart writing and integration of both game and real world lore I would hazard to say it is excellent specimen in its genre. The gameplay is familiar, but more polished, with one or two larger changes, for better. The game is as beautiful as the mechanic allows it to be, with excellent music. Setting is organic and interesting, and much more welcoming than earlier titles have had. However, certain gameplay issues, such as clunky inventory and illusion of choice, do remain in this one too. Yet it gives hope that the next title will continue the steady learning process and increase in quality Harebrained has shown throughout the series.","September 6, 2015","true","76.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

With scenarios like burning SINs, talk of essence, the infected being treated as a marginalized group rather than monsters, the unsteady march of Matrix tech, toxic shamans, geomancy metamagics and so on, the game really does go all in on the setting. Fans of the series will be pleased to know that the writing doesn't assume that the player is completely clueless about all this, though new blood might be a bit overwhelmed. Holistically, this is easily the most ambitious Shadowrun videogame to date. After finishing the game, I do commend the efforts of the design team, but I'm 100% sure they bit off more than they can chew.\n\nLet's start off with how the game has changed since Dragonfall. There' a new "Cybernetic Compatability' skill, tied to Body, which is about as weird and unneccesary as it sounds. Cyberware is oddly not that much different from Dragonfall despite the extra attention given in the statistic system, although there are now cyberweapons, which is great. Etiquettes, which were unlocked in the past 2 games for every 2 points you put into Charisma, are now much more useful, likely a direct response to the widespread criticism of the imbalances between etiquettes in the other games. Some small changes exist across the weapon classes, such as small buffs to SMGs and small nerfs to ARs. The Matrix has been completely redesigned, now existing as a crude but easy-to-understand minigame where you evade matrix perception from White IC to keep your alarm state low while you "hack" (using simon-says like password crackers) through datastores. In keeping with the artistic redesign of the Matrix, the art team went all-out and really made a vast improvement over Dragonfall's visuals.\n\nThat's about as far as it goes. Combat is fundamentally the same, with the same enemy AI protocols being used since Shadowrun Returns, with, what I believe to be no effort whatsoever gone towards environmental design focused on their strengths. In Dragonfall, the AI was quite bad, but effort was given to make suit of their strengths, like positioning cover so that the enemy had the cover advantage and giving most of them grenades so that they can flush you out of cover and punish you for crowding. In Hong Kong, it seems that the design team focused more on what enemies would "realitically have to work with", which, since you are Shadowrunners and don't operate in conditions where you know you're going to have a tough time, is barely anything. There is no longer a Very Hard difficulty, and even on Hard, the combat is laughably easy because the cards are clearly stacked in your favor.\n\nIt might seem odd for me to say that this is both the most ambitious SR title yet and a game that made no effort whatsoever to improve the core mechanic of the game, but I think it's a matter of the design team's philosophy. I believe that HareBrained Studios considered the lackluster combat to be a "neccessary sacrifice" so that they could focus on the rest of the game without finetuning the core gameplay mechanic. HareBrained seem to subscribe to a Biowarian philosophy, where the "technical in-between" of the game does not matter as long as they deliver an immersive interactive experience. And, well...they're better than Bioware at it? But much like the metaplot of the tabletop game, any interest I would have in this story and it's characters mostly comes from the relationship between the characters and the setting. There's such a strained attempt at pathos that it becomes embarassing after a while. I realize that opinions are opinions, and that just because I didn't feel attached to SR:HK's companions doesn't mean others didn't either, but even compared to Dragonfall, who had a companion who's entire personality was "I ♥♥♥♥ up a lot", there's a real disconnect between what the player wants and how the companions deliver information.\n\nIt's like this: Is0bel is cool because she is a dwarven decker with a freaking grenade launcher. Gobbet is cool because she's a rat shaman who likes weird food. Duncan is cool because he's an ex-cop ork who can literally handcuff extra-dimensional beings. All these characters are already cool from a first impression, you don't have to jab me with poor attempts at pathos to make me like them. Gobbet is probably the worst example with this, you have to sit through three different "It was the summer of 83'" style talks with very little (and very forced) room for player input to even get a glimpse of her personal mission, and THEN you have to talk to her AGAIN just to here her say "I need some more time". The companions do this thing where they "emotionally process" things which basically amunts to them not bothering to tell you the whole story until you get 4/5ths of the way through the game in a rather stilted progression. Duncan, mother of god, is nothing but "emotional processing", his entire character is built around the idea that he "can't deal", and you don't even get a cool mission out of it. Look, I signed up to be a Shadowrunner, not a therapist, and I'm not saying you can't have a character that's traumatically driven and also likeable, because the game even accomplishes that with a different character, Gaichu. Gaichu is how you're supposed to write past-driven characters, in that his past pushes him in a direction that coincides with what you need him to do, instead of awkwardly meshing with it. It's too bad his dialogues have apparently not been proofread at all and sometimes he assumes things have happened that have not happened yet, and vice versa. Richter might be the best companion solely for the fact that his dialogue is straight and to the point and not buggy.\n\nSpeaking of which, this game, at least at the time I'm writing this review, is incredibly buggy. I normally don't even mention bugs and performance issues in reviews unless they're very pronounced, and my god are they pronounced here. Dialogue options are greyed out for no reason, dialogue "plays" out of order or fails to trigger at all, companion upgrades don't work, objectives don't work, and I softlocked the game twice during two different missions and had to restart. This is not even getting into the huge amount of typos or failures of logical sequiter, let alone incidents of truly suicidal AI behavior.\n\nMy consumer review is this: If you love Shadowrun, get Dragonfall, and if you like it, get this. If you've never heard of or are iffy on Shadowrun, get Dragonfall, and then MAYBE, if the bugs are all fixed, get this on sale. Overall this is about what you'd expect from a $20 game.","August 23, 2015","true","55.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I really enjoyed the previous two games, Returns and Dragonfall, so I've been looking forward to playing Hong Kong ever since it was announced, and I'm pleased to say that Hong Kong lived up to my expectations.\n\nThe story is excellent. Your character has received a mysterious message from your foster-father, indicating that he's in trouble and asking for your help. After arriving in Hong Kong, you get dragged into a massive conspiracy involving organised crime, corporate espionage and supernatural wierdness. There are lots of interesting characters and the dialogue is well written.\n\nThe turn based combat system is pretty much the same as previous games. You have a team of 4 characters, and each round they spend action points to move, attack (with guns, melee or magic) or use items such as medkits and grenades. Its a system that I really like because there's a lot of tactical depth, especially now that you can customise your companions' abilities when they level up (a feature that was also added to the director's cut of Dragonfall).\n\nMost missions are designed to allow non combat skills to be useful, for example using dialogue options to avoid fighting guards, or hacking a computer to unlock a door.\n\nThe biggest new feature for Hong Kong is the improved matrix system. There's more of a stealth element - some enemies patrol along a set path and they won't attack until you enter their vision cone, so if you're careful you can avoid them. And hacking nodes within the matrix is now a two part mini-game involving remembering sequences of numbers and symbols.\n\nMy only disappointment is the continued lack of voice acting. It didn't spoil my enjoyment of the game, but its something that I would like to see added if there's a fourth Shadowrun, because I think it would elevate a good game into a great game.\n\nIt took me 20 hours to finish the main story and I think I completed all the side quests as well. I didn't encounter any bugs or crashes. I also want to say that the music is pretty good and matches the oriental theme.\n\nOverall Hong Kong is a really good game, fans of the series will certainly enjoy it, and its worth a full price purchase. The story is not connected to the previous games, so if you're new to Shadowrun, you could choose to play the games in any order.","September 29, 2015","true","20.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theheap/recommended/346940/","Theheap","Beeps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theheap/","50 products in account","This is going to be less concrete than the reviews I usually do, mostly a stream of conciousness thing, Maybe in reflection of the fact that the game is very here-and-there and doesn't really bother framing a complete picture.\n\nI believe that SR:HK is the most "complete" Shadowrun game made since the Genesis title, in terms of adjusting the player to the unique setting. With scenarios like burning SINs, talk of essence, the infected being treated as a marginalized group rather than monsters, the unsteady march of Matrix tech, toxic shamans, geomancy metamagics and so on, the game really does go all in on the setting. Fans of the series will be pleased to know that the writing doesn't assume that the player is completely clueless about all this, though new blood might be a bit overwhelmed. Holistically, this is easily the most ambitious Shadowrun videogame to date. After finishing the game, I do commend the efforts of the design team, but I'm 100% sure they bit off more than they can chew.\n\nLet's start off with how the game has changed since Dragonfall. There' a new "Cybernetic Compatability' skill, tied to Body, which is about as weird and unneccesary as it sounds. Cyberware is oddly not that much different from Dragonfall despite the extra attention given in the statistic system, although there are now cyberweapons, which is great. Etiquettes, which were unlocked in the past 2 games for every 2 points you put into Charisma, are now much more useful, likely a direct response to the widespread criticism of the imbalances between etiquettes in the other games. Some small changes exist across the weapon classes, such as small buffs to SMGs and small nerfs to ARs. The Matrix has been completely redesigned, now existing as a crude but easy-to-understand minigame where you evade matrix perception from White IC to keep your alarm state low while you "hack" (using simon-says like password crackers) through datastores. In keeping with the artistic redesign of the Matrix, the art team went all-out and really made a vast improvement over Dragonfall's visuals.\n\nThat's about as far as it goes. Combat is fundamentally the same, with the same enemy AI protocols being used since Shadowrun Returns, with, what I believe to be no effort whatsoever gone towards environmental design focused on their strengths. In Dragonfall, the AI was quite bad, but effort was given to make suit of their strengths, like positioning cover so that the enemy had the cover advantage and giving most of them grenades so that they can flush you out of cover and punish you for crowding. In Hong Kong, it seems that the design team focused more on what enemies would "realitically have to work with", which, since you are Shadowrunners and don't operate in conditions where you know you're going to have a tough time, is barely anything. There is no longer a Very Hard difficulty, and even on Hard, the combat is laughably easy because the cards are clearly stacked in your favor.\n\nIt might seem odd for me to say that this is both the most ambitious SR title yet and a game that made no effort whatsoever to improve the core mechanic of the game, but I think it's a matter of the design team's philosophy. I believe that HareBrained Studios considered the lackluster combat to be a "neccessary sacrifice" so that they could focus on the rest of the game without finetuning the core gameplay mechanic. HareBrained seem to subscribe to a Biowarian philosophy, where the "technical in-between" of the game does not matter as long as they deliver an immersive interactive experience. And, well...they're better than Bioware at it? But much like the metaplot of the tabletop game, any interest I would have in this story and it's characters mostly comes from the relationship between the characters and the setting. There's such a strained attempt at pathos that it becomes embarassing after a while. I realize that opinions are opinions, and that just because I didn't feel attached to SR:HK's companions doesn't mean others didn't either, but even compared to Dragonfall, who had a companion who's entire personality was "I ♥♥♥♥ up a lot", there's a real disconnect between what the player wants and how the companions deliver information.\n\nIt's like this: Is0bel is cool because she is a dwarven decker with a freaking grenade launcher. Gobbet is cool because she's a rat shaman who likes weird food. Duncan is cool because he's an ex-cop ork who can literally handcuff extra-dimensional beings. All these characters are already cool from a first impression, you don't have to jab me with poor attempts at pathos to make me like them. Gobbet is probably the worst example with this, you have to sit through three different "It was the summer of 83'" style talks with very little (and very forced) room for player input to even get a glimpse of her personal mission, and THEN you have to talk to her AGAIN just to here her say "I need some more time". The companions do this thing where they "emotionally process" things which basically amunts to them not bothering to tell you the whole story until you get 4/5ths of the way through the game in a rather stilted progression. Duncan, mother of god, is nothing but "emotional processing", his entire character is built around the idea that he "can't deal", and you don't even get a cool mission out of it. Look, I signed up to be a Shadowrunner, not a therapist, and I'm not saying you can't have a character that's traumatically driven and also likeable, because the game even accomplishes that with a different character, Gaichu. Gaichu is how you're supposed to write past-driven characters, in that his past pushes him in a direction that coincides with what you need him to do, instead of awkwardly meshing with it. It's too bad his dialogues have apparently not been proofread at all and sometimes he assumes things have happened that have not happened yet, and vice versa. Richter might be the best companion solely for the fact that his dialogue is straight and to the point and not buggy.\n\nSpeaking of which, this game, at least at the time I'm writing this review, is incredibly buggy. I normally don't even mention bugs and performance issues in reviews unless they're very pronounced, and my god are they pronounced here. Dialogue options are greyed out for no reason, dialogue "plays" out of order or fails to trigger at all, companion upgrades don't work, objectives don't work, and I softlocked the game twice during two different missions and had to restart. This is not even getting into the huge amount of typos or failures of logical sequiter, let alone incidents of truly suicidal AI behavior.\n\nMy consumer review is this: If you love Shadowrun, get Dragonfall, and if you like it, get this. If you've never heard of or are iffy on Shadowrun, get Dragonfall, and then MAYBE, if the bugs are all fixed, get this on sale. Overall this is about what you'd expect from a $20 game.","August 23, 2015","true","55.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Especialy the BlockerID minimgame is one that i could do without.\n\nCharakters are nicely done but dont come quiet close to someone like Dlory and Dietrich. But you get to see some people out of the Fluxstate and releated ones. As example Zack Flash, the Girlfried of Blitz, a commerad tells you Lucky Strike was his runnermate back in the day. Overall good but not great.\n\nRuns are in my opinion very limited. Would have been nice if the devs had made more of them with a deeper storyinteraction.

I wish to write this as a counter-argument to RPS' ridiculous review which said "It only adds scenery, not actual gameplay changes, tho people who like the shadowrun universe will undoubtedly love it." I usually agree almost totally with RPS reviews, but this one really took me aback because it seemed as tho the reviewer didn't even play the game. I may love the shadowrun universe and its tropes, but I'm no fanboy in the sense of sticking to a brand just because it is that brand. In fact, while the same engine has been used (with new anti-aliasing x8 support for a real graphical upgrade), the mechanics of the game finally feel well-fleshed-out and balanced. Some spoilers on gear you can obtain ahead.\n\nChanged Mechanics/Added Gear/Balance:\n-Skills that are balanced and make sense: finally, the skill tree doesn't feel like it's reinventing shadowrun mechanics as much. While still not incredibly true to the pen-and-paper game, the addition of "Cyberware Affinity" makes body worth investing in not only for the HP, and cool things occur like mages and adepts both benefit from willpower, so I made a mage-adept (in that order) for fun, tho usually the mage skills are my mainstay, the adept passives like higher movement speed and protection from magical or physical damage are incredibly useful even if I'm not using my magical sword of doom on this particular mission, hitting twice per round, and using the adept counterattack qi. This kind of thing makes you decide between spells/qi to put in your spell slots and tailor it to the mission parameters.\n-Trade most objects (some are character-specific and "locked") between your chosen team and the stash. Allows you to buy weapons for your teammates if you so choose, tho see below.\n-Main teammates level up system: As you level up, your teammates will too, allowing you to choose between two distinct abilities unique to that character per level. Their gear will also improve, particularly if you talk to them often.\n-Cyberware overhaul. Ever wanted cyberware to actually be game-changing and have insanely cool special abilities? Well, that's in now. Cyberweapons, like the monofilament whip that hits up to 7 tiles away. Eyeballs that flash bright lights acting like flashbangs to enemies. Wired reflexes/Reflex Triggers that give you significant advantage.\n-Totally reworked Matrix/Hacking minigame: The Matrix really comes to life in this game, and not just in the art. Now tracer drones patrol the matrix seeking to make the system more aware of your presence. "Blocker IC" walls can be overcome by forcing them (costs 50 system awareness), hacking them in a challenging memory-minigame that costs 20 awareness, or knowing the password and keying it in. The Matrix is insanely useful now, with cooler programs to choose from, and I keep my decker-teammate close at hand on every run, tho it's not strictly necessary.\n-Foci/Fetishes/Totems: Focused spells available that mod the basic function of spells in cool ways... a strip armor spell that gives you back 1 AP if you hit, but does less armor stripping, for example. Fetish objects that increase your base stats when in your inventory (doesn't take up a spell slot tho). Shamans now get to choose which "totem" or animal-god they follow, which can alter their stats, or give really cool active and/or passive abilities.\n-New Gun Choices: Not only are there guns like the grenade launcher, but things like the remington roomsweeper (a pistol that shoots like a shotgun), pistols that fire three-times in one shot, prototype laser-snipers, flechette (bleeding dmg) weapons, and more now exist and force you to carefully choose your own style of blastin' badguys.\n-Very Good Story: I do kind of feel like SRR: Berlin had a better story overall still, but this Hong Kong Mystery really does keep you wondering. My main complaint here is that the writing seems a bit stilted in places, and lacks the gritty polish of SRR: Berlin. Still, tons of side-conversations to have with your fellow runners and a lot of fun.\n\nWhat I'd like to see in the next SRR game:\n-New engine: scrap isometric rending, I'm a bit tired of being stuck behind buildings and not being able to rotate the camera. I want more character model choices that are more detailed, and I want to zoom in the camera very closely to see all the diffent details of my gear and active/passive spell effects on my character.\n-Open-world: A bit less linear of a world. Yes, mission order and even which missions you take are optional, but let's face it most people playing are going to want to get all the karma and nuyen they can and be completionists. While different dialogue options do really influence the outcomes of runs now, there should really be an open-world in the sense of just exploring and running into runs rather than the formulaic "back to base, take the train to another run, loading screen, rinse-repeat." The sega genesis shadowrun game was much more open-world, guys, and that was ages ago. Use too-difficult-for-lower-level-runner areas to pace the plot\n\nAll together, tho, this game is EASILY worth the very modest non-sale price that's currently $20 non-deluxe. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone looking for a great story and tactical turn-based XCOM-like combat with a ♥♥♥♥ ton of customization and character progression thrown in for a true, gritty, futuristic sci-fi experience that we've all come to know as "Cyberpunk."","August 23, 2015","true","88.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shoitaan/recommended/346940/","Shoitaan","Shoitaan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shoitaan/","125 products in account","SR: Hong Kong is a gem of an RPG that’s (as of writing) still a few patches away from being a masterpiece.\n\nPros\n\nIt’s a visual delight that is leagues ahead of the previous games in *almost* every aspect of it’s presentation and finish. Between the great visual design and sharp writing, it truly feels like a cyber dystopian version of Hong Kong. There’s also surprising insight into Asian culture and conduct that most western games miss. The music is great but doesn’t feel as memorable as it did in previous games but definitely adds to every scene.\n\nEvery major character is interesting and memorable. I thought it would be hard to beat SR: Dragonfall on how much you learn to like your party members but SR: Hong Kong really exceeds expectations. One of the characters you start with, your adopted brother seemed like a pretty generic type of angry ex-cop. Over many conversations with him throughout the game, however, you effectively pick what your history and relationship with him and your adoptive father was. And as the ‘mutually agreed on history’ comes back into play throughout the game, you start to feel less like a person clicking through dialogue options and more like you’re in an improv play. The story, although nothing dramatically new, does things in interesting new ways and feels fresh and great.\nThe other aspects of the game are also well done and a marked improvement from previous games.\n\nCons\n\nThe story feels more personal than in most RPGs but it I wish there were a few more main story missions. By the time end game rolled around, it felt like there was a slight disconnect between the plot and the rest of the game. Which is not an accident, you’re hired as a shadowrunner while the NPCs run down leads on main plot but it still does feel a bit front and end heavy with the middle being completely unrelated stuff.\n\nI love the changes to the matrix (hacking) sections but until the very last level, you don’t realise how lazy they got with the change. The matrix is simply the same throughout the game until you hack the big corporate servers in one of the last missions and suddenly, *this* matrix is vastly different. Gorgeous even. Why can’t each corporate matrix have it’s own visual identity? Surely breaking into the Ares research labs on a side mission should have this kind of effort as well. Seems like a lazy omission that is very unfortunate. Some people may also hate the new changes to the matrix but I’m not one of them.\n\nBugs, so many bugs. Nothing too dramatic but the game definitely needed a few more weeks of QA. They may have hotfixed the progress blocking bugs but a plethora of bugs remain ranging from:\n\n- An NPC you spoke to for ages and used dialogue options to advance the story with: talk to them again and they have no memory of talking to you and all the dialogue options you had previously selected are missing. Progress isn’t stopped as the dialogue options all triggered stuff in the game it’s just weird and super immersion breaking. This happened MANY times but mostly in the last 25% of the campaign.\n- 2 side-quest lines somehow resolved themselves as failures without me doing anything. One of these quests was both tied to an achievement and also glitched the relevant NPCs so there were 2 people where there should have been one (1 should exist in a mission success state and the other in a fail state, not both).\n- The NPCs in club 88 and numerous NPCs in the epilogue all have a plethora of disappointing and immersion breaking dialogue bugs.\n- During the final boss fight, there was… unusual behaviour among the NPCs. Instead of the character that was upgraded to throw back grenades doing that, a completely different party member was picking up projectiles and hurling them at friends. Very weird.\n\nOverall this game is amazing but I did miss out on achievements and some good memories because of the bugs. If you’re a huge fan of the SR series then get it now, play it, and play it a second time after the bugs are gone (which I intend to do). If you’re on the fence and just looking for a good RPG, go play SR: Dragonfall while they patch out the bugs out of this one – but definitely revisit after patches. This game is fantastic.","August 27, 2015","true","33.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I would be sitting there for a solid hour listening to my party members and shopkeepers talking about their lives and all that. There's a whole lot of telling and not so much showing. I feel that if you'd just done two actual missions for party members rather than just one it would've fleshed things out a lot more smoothly.\n\nCouple that with the fact that there are entire missions that you just talk your way through and this started to feel like a Choose Your Own Adventure game after a bit.\n\nAlso shopkeepers don't need elaborate backstories, don't waste time on that.\n\n2) The game is pretty easy.\n\nI played through the whole game on 'hard' difficulty and, outside of the first mission when I didn't have any equipment, never had trouble. The AI is just completely terrible and never offers a challenge. They walk through poison gas, they glitch and forget to do an attack and they never focus fire. And there's just never any curve ball that gives you that 'oh ♥♥♥♥' moment like in Dragonfall. No Troll Cyborg hacking, no duels with other Deckers in the Matrix and no crazy duplicating satan fights.\n\nI didn't expect XCom here, but I still pretty much beat the whole game without breaking a sweat.\n\nVirtues:\n\n1) The story and world are genuinely interesting.\n\nAfter the travesty that was Shadowrun Chronicles, I'm quite relieved to find that this thing was back on track with a compelling story with interesting twists and turns. The game gives you a decent amount of room to develop your own character and her backstory, while also giving you the chance to have interesting relationships with people. I was pleased that the plethora of ways to complete each quest and felt I had built a character with real personality after some time.\n\n2) There's a good diversity of missions.\n\nYou get to solve a murder mystery, infiltrate a convention and break down corporate offices. There's nothing quite as good as Glory's mission from Dragonfall, but there's good stuff here.\n\nOverall: If you liked Dragonfall, you'll have something to like here, but it probably won't meet that gold standard.","August 30, 2015","true","37.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

Thes are the types of games I look all over steam for hoping that I missed a hidden gem.

The new portraits they've done also look great but the older ones look out of place. The campaign is still a bit short but atleast longer (in my opinion) than the previous two games.\n\nA few downsides to me personally, is that I could play the last two perfectly with near to no fps losses, while for some reason a few scenes cause my screen to tear and freeze slightly, plus a few animations are still buggy/the karma system takes quite awhile to open up.\n\nIf you are looking for a fun turned-based game to get into, Shadowrun: Hong Kong is a good place to begin!","August 22, 2015","true","24.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/awfulcitizen/recommended/346940/","awfulcitizen","Awful Citizen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/awfulcitizen/","447 products in account","I just finished the game (well last night) and my experience with it was kind of bland.  Generally speaking the game played almost like a Point-and-Click Interactive Story.  The game played a lot like its previous iterations, from a game design point of view, and the graphical upgrades to the Matrix are pretty neat but not as exciting, it feels like they didnt put too much effort on it as they should have.  The new puzzle system (for hacking) in the Matrix killed it for me, the whole simon-sez / Memory game wasn't well laid out and was boring.  In general the game was good... But not exciting good.\n\nThe story itself was interesting at some points but it felt more like the campaign someone back in my highschool days would coin up to play on a saturday afternoon.  It was good but not $30 - $20 good.  There were a lot of flaws in the writing, like I said it was very bland and forgettable and not well thought out specially at the beginning.  A good word to describe it would have been... Meh.\n\nWhatever upgrade they did with the graphics engine is pretty neat.  The artwork in the game is pretty good, it feels almost like being on a painting.  If it were not for the artwork I don't think I would have been compelled to play the game so much if it wasnt because the graphics were that pretty.\n\nThe so-called Matrix update artwork-wise was really good, I liked the new representation of it.  I still think at Char-Gen you should be able to pick an avatar for your character instead of the floating generic one, as it doesnt make you feel part of the game just another random icon to be a part of.  The Gameplay in the Matrix was horrible.  I understand the need to put a mechanic for the "hacking" part of the game but playing Simon-Sez with the numbers is not it... Then that memory game to figure the codes was also pretty stupid and boring.  They should have randomized the mini-games in the Matrix at least...\n\nThe other thing was you couldn't upgrade in any way any of your companions, you can "Level" them but its very bland and un-intrusive and pretty insignificant, but you can't add cyber to them or change their weapons or spells.\n\nThe overall gameplay was pretty much the same as in the other games of the series.  But the whole interaction felt like a point-and-click story than an RPG and overall the game was too short.  By the time you got the cash to up your gear the game was over.  The game feels more like an expansion to the original game than anything else... Dragonfall had a much more bigger impact on me as a player than this game overall.  I was really expecting a lot more for the time the developers took to build this game.  It feels incomplete and rushed, from the sense that the story even with the side stories and the "team" stories were interesting, but it felt rushed.\n\nI wish tha game had been longer, had some more depth and had a better story.  But Shadowrun is one of my favorite Cyberpunk pen and paper RPG, and until Cyberpunk 2077 hits the streets it is what it is...\n\nAs a conclusion, I think of this game as an expansion-DLC type.  I wish they re-made the previous games with the engine and graphic optimization they did on this game, and have them all under one engine... But I think the game could have been better, for the time they took to make it.  I think it was very cool they added the portraits of some of the backers in areas of the game, it was a nice touch of gratitude.\n\nOverall the game is a 7/10 in my book.  The game took me about 26hrs of compressed time, with all the side stories, companion stories and fiddle-farting-around.  Started playing it Friday afternoon and finished it Sunday evening.\n\nI am going to give it a couple of weeks, and play the game again as a streeet samurai rather than a decker to see other aspects of the game, but I dont think i am going to see a whole lot different than I have seen so far.","August 24, 2015","true","41.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

It was great in many ways, and it was a good cRPG game to come out... well, in ages. People just don't make too many good games nowadays on my opinion and rpg's in general aren't really made anymore. So it was great.\n\nThe second one, Dragonfall was even better. They created a new story using the same engine with improvements. A lot of things were improved on an already good game and the story was more interesting and it felt even more like an rpg. I liked it a lot, especially as a pen-and-paper roleplayer.\n\nNow were here on the third one. I found out I was actually looking forward to it. That was a bit of a surprice considering the current state of the game industry and how it has turned me into a bitter and sad gamer. Anyways, the game just got released and I've played it abit. Well I can already say, it's pretty ♥♥♥♥ing badass. It's even better gamewise, and it seems even better story- and rpgwise, which is impressive. It makes me happy actually. Just realised that. I don't remember the last time I've been happy.\n\nAnyways, if you didn't gather from all that, I do strongly recommend it, even though I haven't played it through yeat. BUT I recommend you play the previous games first if you haven't already. If you like this game, I'm sure you will like the previous ones too, but you'll enjoy the previous ones more if you play them first.\n\nI know that wasn't much of a review, but in short if you are looking for good cRPG, then these are it.

Notable in that the story is very well told, with some more nuanced approaches to missions as opposed to Dragonfall's tendency to have A or B endings to a mission. They also include several missions where giving up an obvious benefit or doing something right will benefit you later with allies. It still follows in Returns/Dragonfalls steps in including a rather major event that fits well into the history of shadowrun, without retconning anything. The prime runners you get are very likable, and the characters around town you talk to are fleshed out well enough that you don't mind talking to them after each run.\n\nThe major change in gameplay is the matrix runs, where they are now half-stealth and half combat. Mostly this comes down to avoiding obvious sight trails with careful movement, and unlocking doors with a rather clever and simple minigame. You can brute force still, but its obviously much harder and more dangerous. I got a bit frustrated with it at times, but I think it fits the hacking a bit better.\n\nMy only complaint is a relatively minor one, in that adepts are still restricted to melee. While obviously a CRPG will have a hard time adjusting to Shadowruns huge possibility tables, this still feels like something that would be easy to fix. Also any cyber-weapons in the game are melee, where it seems it would be easy to include a gun on the table as well.\n\nIf you haven't played the previous two: Play Dragonfall and this, not in any particular order (the stories don't connect). They are amazingly well done turn based CRPGs, with combat that is similar to X-com with hiding behind cover and action point based turns. Well crafted and unique missions make the twenty-ish hour campaign worth the price.","August 31, 2015","true","37.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Look, it's anticlimatical when you miss over and over and over, due to something as insignificant as a few mere numbers of chance, especially when as with 80%, that chance should be considerably high. It makes one wonder why another solution was never considered, say one within a certain close range is *always* guaranteed a hit, but the further away the more difficult etc., less damage. In short, % are something that's always bugged the gameplay flow for me, and that goes for DMS, DF:DC, and even back on the days of SNES, it's just always been an issue. It may go well in pen and paper, and die, virtually, it's  a nussaince.\n\nBut onto some HK specifics:\n\nOkay, I actually like the story. Qi? A nice touch. The story starts solid enough: Duncan is to-the-point, shadowruners die, you run. You're trying to erase your SINs... then after a while things get bogged down in Shadowrun NPC talk, and you find yourself just going through the routine.. Still, there's a very interesting overall situation and swing to what you're up against, it's just that it all never quite pans out. I don't really care for the old man you're looking into, (whats-his-name? Raymond?) Not cause I'm a heartless individual behind my computer screen, just that throughout the game, there's nothing to bounce back on and keep me involved that he exists and is a compelling character.I mean, really, what is there?\n\nDuncan?\n\nThe guy drones on and on about life as kids, but never really *acts* Heck, I don't even see Raymonds face (or hear his voice again) until the very end of the game. It's dull, and the characters, including my team of unrealized eccentrics who yammer on for hours, don't make me care so much about them. When it comes to emotional attachment, they keep to their namesakes and they lurk in the shadows. you're left just passing missions and hoping the next one is way cooler than the one preceeding it.The game keeps you at a distance, rather than drawing you in too much, and that continues the entire game, leaving you with a mostly unemotionally satisfied experiecence. Still, at least Hong Kong *looks* nice.\n\nThen there's the problem with the sub-narrative, or just the writing/dialogue/action events in general. ARGGGHHH!! Ahem, do you know what it's like for a completionalist gamer to finish a low active mission, return to the hub zone, and speak with NPC's and read the dialouge of characters you care #$*&*#$ about for over ONE BLOODY HOUR?!?! It is teeth-pullingly, dry-paint watchingly, agonizingly tedious thats what!!!! These NPCs don't support the main quest; they add nothing to it!!\n\nTake the club owner family dad who wants to become a pirate again.\n\nWHO THE HELL CARES?!?!\n\nIt doesn't make my life in the shadows any easier or add value to it or to the mission... Perhaps he's there just to add ambience to Hong Kong? Okay, look. I can SEE the area of Hong Kong is a $*#@ hole. I can use my imagination that it attracts pirates and that sort. There's no real need to spell it out, and certainly not over a tedious thirty minutes of family tension, and text bickering. If characters don't add anything to the plot (or contain no subplots of their own), why are they even there? If they're going to be of interest to you, they ought to tie in to the story with their own emotional arc. Otherwise, they should just sell you the guns, swords, and spellbooks, and tell you the boss is looking for you for the next task, and thats that. (The young girl at the magic shop started doing this after a while, much to ones haggard relief).\n\nIt's also of no help that almost all of Shadowrun is written in passive voice, and uses a ton of adverbs, so the action tends to bog down even more. Rather than just simply rely on the decrepit, slum visuals to communicate the job, the writing describes a great deal, getting caught up in every nuisance, and never quite hitting the main bits and then moving on. After a while, you tend to just skim the actions, read gist, and hope you haven't missed anything that'll cause you to loose an achievement or even get to play a mission.\n\n\nThe Matrix. Q) If you had some of $700,000, assigned to revamp the entire Matrix system, what would you do?\n\nApparently, besides the (excellent) visual upgrade, the result is to make "watcher" units, frustrating knit so close together you can barely pass comfortably, change the walking animation to an odd glide where at first you think your characters glitching, and include repetitive memorization and visual brain logic puzzles, some of which not every gamer may be able to pass with only a low kit Decker in tow; like the default provided. (Thank goodness I'm good enough at logic puzzles). The end result? A system revamp overhaul with *completely* nothing to write home about, and one that makes one wonder just what was so bad about the other suggestions put up for consideration that they weren't used.\n\nThe Matrix is probably the single biggest change letdown out there. Try conquering it with a low to average decker (Is0bel). It is frustrating as heck, and after a while, just to be sure you won't end up repeatinga watcher dodge and raising the alarm by 20 points, you'll opt to save like crazy whenever you pass a couple of the lamely placed enemies, cause, who knows? Next time you won't be so lucky...  Of course, it doesn't help that the aim system lacks: 90%+ should be guaranteed to hit, I miss 2 99%s in a row, at almost point blank range. Enemies turn: they hit me twice, BAM!! Force Jack out. $#&*!!!!\n\nStill, SR:HK isn't all not all that bad.\n\nSome perks: visually, it captures the now familiar disdain Shadowrun cyberpunk dysfunction. It's musical score is *sharply* on point, giving a delicious track of electronic and cyber with regional overtones, but never quite bogging down in a type of cheesy "futuristic Chinse sound" thing. Heck, the game's overall contextual situational story is interesting (as mentioned earlier). Up to a point, anyways. Some the missions are fun, though none stand out as stellar parts.\n\nSo, in conclusion, we have a game that has a good story and situation, but that never quite impacts with the mark, be this cause of bland characters who are barely emotionally invested with one another and their own worlds, a boggy mire of convoluted characterization, dialogue, and text, and some letdowns in bizarre upgrades in areas which really ought to hav come kickin'. Where does that leave us? With a pretty average title, nowhere near pushing the mark or the envelope and giving a bang for the buck.\n\nNoted, for the fourth time around. Be there one.\n\n4/10","August 28, 2015","false","51.0"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","21","40","2","0"

I got this twice, the first time I had to go back to a previous save thus losing about 15 minutes since it was a big firefight with a matrix run occurring simultaneously. The second time it was towards the end of the game and I had to walk turn-by-turn until I finally entered a new area: I'm pretty sure this glitched an optional encounter that'd have taken place and prevented me from getting an extra companion for the end boss fight.\n\n-dodgy framerate during a mission towards the end of the game (probably related to a bug aswell)\n\n-loading times are quite long when entering a level, reloading a save or entering the skill screen\n\n-a few difficulty spikes\n\n-some typos here and there\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=504780240\n\nShadowrun: Hong Kong is a great and engaging RPG whose setting alone, with its mix of fantasy and sci-fi, makes it worth playing. I had alot of fun during missions since I'd experiment with my skills and try to complete objectives without drawing attention or using violence, said missions also had a good variety in their goals and level design: you also never know when something unexpected might happen turning a milk run into something more dangerous.\n\nThe story is really well-written, sports enough mistery and touches your character personally enough to make you want to uncover what and who is behind it: some more memorable moments can also be found in the few side missions offered by your companions (sadly not all of them have one).\n\nThe gameplay itself is also fun and flows well between exploring in real time and switching to a turn based system during combat: whenever a fight starts you'll have a plethora of different weapons, skills, spells and items to choose from depending on how you build your character and what companions you're bringing with you. The rewamped cyberspace also provides a good challenge and is an important part of the game.\n\nI'm giving the game a positive review because it deserves it, but I caution prospective buyers to wait for a patch that solves the "stuck in combat" bug if possible: it's not gamebreaking per se but it'd make you lose quite a bit of playtime if you're not careful with saves and repeating difficult fights can get truly frustrating.","August 27, 2015","true","31.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It would have rivaled or perhaps even surpassed the already impressive, nearly-flawless Dragonfall with the improvements on decking, the expanded NPC list, and the equally intriguing plotline.  However, several bugs cause problems and knock this game backwards.  Most bugs are just amusing - I managed to open the menu on a neutral character's turn, only to see their character profile.  They were named "I am a Troll Ha ha ha" or something along those lines.  It was great.  But other bugs really disrupt gameplay.  They're rare, but common enough to be a problem.\n\nThat said, the game is a lot of fun.  Harebrained took everything people loved from the earlier games and added more of it, while redoing some things that were less appealing.  All the changes were intelligent and well thought out.  The improved items, the improved skill tree, the improved decking, alongside a plot that's just as good as Dragonfall, makes this another RPG gem.  And we need more cyberpunk RPGs.  For the money you won't find much better than this.\n\nThe decking upgrade is worth special mention.  Decking before was... kinda lame.  You popped in, killed any IC you found in a shootout minigame, and carried on.  They have now turned it into a stealth minigame, with alert levels, locked doors (blocker IC, whatever, shut up) and, if you're caught, a shootout.  It's much more involved and much more fun.\n\nBottom Line: Absolute recommend","November 10, 2015","true","50.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This one changed up the matrix a lot.  It was a fresh twist, made decking quite a bit different than meatspace combat.  There is a memory mini-game when hacking blocking IRCs.  It was fun, but could be challenging if one had limited brain space.\n\nI liked the story of Dragonfall better, but this one was ok.  I hated that there were not more jobs to get more money.  Never felt like I was fully equiped, but maybe that was the point.  I would have liked to see more optional missions to do before the main story so that I could get everything I wanted.\n\nIf I have time I'll rerun the campagn with a troll chocked full of augmentations.  I'd make some decisions differently just to see how they play out.\n\nOverall, 8.5/10.  Would run the shadows again\n\n***SPOILER***.\nThe final mission to Prosperity tower was hard.  I had to resort to combat on two of the three levels.  I would have liked to be able to avoid it, but the options were not really built for my decker character.

This is a combination interactive novel with RPG elements and X-Com tactical combat. It's an excellent late night game to play before going to bed. Won't get you riled up and it's interesting enough to give you something to think about, keeps you thirsty to get you to play it again.\n\nI'm really glad though they ended up fine tuning and streamlining this -- it's a huge difference between the first one and now, with quality of life changes.

More like nightmares. And demons...\n●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●\n×°×★Summary Review★×°×\nOverall Rating: ★★★☆☆ [3/5]\nStory: ★★★☆☆\nGameplay: ★★★☆☆\nSound: ★★★★★\n●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●\n★OVERALL★\nReminiscent of expansion packs in the 1990's, Hong Kong is a standalone story staying true to the already established world within the previously released Shadowrun Returns. Once again, just like with the release of Dragonfall, Harebrained Schemes has given us an entirely new game. There have been some much needed improvements to the combat system, a rebuilt UI, new cyber-skills, and the addition of illustrated cinematic transitions for the storyline; however, they made some changes to the Matrix and Decking that you may or may not like. It's not easy to follow up such an epic story with great characters as was in Dragonfall. And if you played it prior to Hong Kong, you may be left feeling a bit wanting by the end. Much like a warm-up band playing after the main concert. You might feel the urge to leave the show early...\n\n★STORY★\nThis time, you *don't* start out as a shadowrunner. Long estranged from the man who raised you, you've lived a comfy life in Seattle and have all but forgotten your childhood. Until, without warning, your father sends you a trid requesting you meet him in Hong Kong immediately, but gives you no explanations as to why. So, out of guilt or a sense of loyalty, you drop everything and hop on the next flight to China. But he's not there to greet you when you arrive. Instead, the boy you grew up with, Duncan Wu, now a member of the Seattle police force called 'Lone Star,' is there on the docks. Surprised to see each other, you discover that neither of you know what's going on and quickly things take a turn for the worse. Suddenly, you're forced into the underground and to survive you must become a shadowrunner in one of the most dangerous, and profitable places in the Sixth World- The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone.\n\nUnfortunately, SR:HK falls short of the glory that was Dragonfall. Which is disappointing given the interesting and rich setting of Hong Kong, especially since they had a pretty clean slate to work with as Shadowrun lore doesn't touch on much of the Asian side of the world. It has some of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a video game, the worst of which are Duncan Wu and Is0bel. Their dialog sounds like emo teenagers and I just want to slap them. Hard. With a bullet to the face. And if it were me, I'd outright resent having my father drag my ♥♥♥ all the way to China to fix *his* problems! It's no wonder your character left him to begin with. In spite of all this, it might be forgivable if the plot wasn't so predictable. After 25 hours into the story, the only reason I continued was out of a compulsion to complete the damn thing so I could shelve it and never return.\n\n★GAMEPLAY★\nI've come to think of the Shadowrun Returns series more as an interactive virtual novel with tactical and roleplaying elements. Because the true lure of this game is not the gameplay, but the story. I'm not saying that it's bad, it's just not what makes the game entertaining. While you're able to change some elements of the story to your own unique perspective, the main storyline arc remains similar. And customizing your character has little impact on how the story develops, instead offering a different perspective on the same events.\n\nHowever, there have been some improvements to the combat system. Now the floating combat text includes events such as "Dodged," instead of only telling you if you hit or missed. Also, your percent chance to hit seems much more accurate than in previous games. I don't know if a layer of RNG was removed or just tweaked but combat is much more enjoyable than it was in SR:R and SR:DF. Sadly, it seems this improvement has come at the cost of a weak story.\n\n★SOUND & MUSIC★\nJon Everist has composed the music for both Dragonfall and Hong Kong, and he was one of three composers that created the original soundtrack to Shadowrun Returns. As usual, his talent is one of the shining highlights of this series. He successfully mixed traditional asian instruments with modern techno music to create a unique sound that feels appropriate for the futuristic setting of neo-China. I recommend buying the deluxe edition for the added bonus of the game soundtrack. It’s a welcome addition to anyone’s music collection.\n\n★BUGS & BOTHERS★\nUnfortunately, there exists a bug that can be very game breaking. Sometimes, items left on your characters will disappear after the mission is completed. Items like weapons, medkits, and spells. It's extremely frustrating to say the least… There’s no workaround that I know of and there’s no sign of a fix in sight.\n\nNow let's talk about the overhauled Matrix. While the look of the Matrix is much improved from the previous Shadowrun games, the mechanics are completely different and not for the better, in my opinion.\n\nDeckers can now “eject” from the Matrix at anytime, but doing so severely hurts your Decker’s HP. Making it an unacceptable risk during combat and basically unnecessary out of combat. Never once did I use the eject ability during my playthrough. It’s a good idea, but the cost is too high.\n\nOnce again Deckers get the shaft. While combat in meatspace has been much improved, combat in the Matrix has become more difficult. In previous games, it wasn’t hard to raise your programs skill high enough to reach a 99% hit chance. In Hong Kong, however, that’s only possible at max skill. And the further you are from your target, the more severe the penalty to your hit chance. It’s almost like they swapped combat systems between meatspace and the Matrix. And since you can’t level up your companion’s abilities, Is0bel, your resident Decker, remains a mediocre choice when trying to hack your way through a security system.\n\nWhile in the Matrix, you must dodge watcher programs that follow a specific path and if they spot you, it will raise the alarm level by +20 each turn for every watcher that has spotted you. And they're absolutely everywhere. Some areas of the Matrix are literally crawling with watcher programs to the point of madness. On top of that, you must bypass Blockers using their new Hacking system. Blockers are basically giant virtual walls that stand between you and your objective. You must hack, enter a password, or override it at the cost of +50 to your alarm level. This wouldn't be so bad if the Hacking system wasn't an annoying mixture of "Simon Says" and "Guess Who?" using pseudo-geometric shapes that don't make any sense combined with yet another level of RNG. It's not that hacking is difficult, once you understand what you're supposed to do, but it's just so damned *annoying* since you encounter the blasted things multiple times on *every* mission!","December 29, 2015","true","39.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having played all SRs, I'd like to add a few brief words about it... It's a good game if you're a fan of the series, but this is really a buggy affair, no way around this. Expect a lot of replaying, specially the last few missions, so SAVE often because you will do some backtracking.\n\nThe interface is glitchy and buggy, animations are stuttery and click capture laughable at best, here a better job could've definitely been done.\n\nOTOH, the game looks gorgeously hand drawn throughout, and it's still Shadowrun as far as creating a new build and playing through its countless missions.\n\nI did enjoy the fact that the game has become longer, so there's a lot of time for fighting and developing your character throughout, as well as enjoying the process of learning how to fit in the team and make the best out of every possible roster member you decide to bring along. The strategic aspects of the game are impeccable as always and just a blast.\n\nLastly, the matrix engine was "ok-ish" for the first play-through, but just taxing and not fun second time around. I guess I won't be doing any more experimenting on this one because I don't want to have to go through all the hacking sections, they've become long and boring fillers between otherwise good missions.\n\nSR:DF blows this one out of the water, so if you haven't played that one, do yourself a favor and go for it. If you have and crave a bit of SR fun, go for this one knowing that there still are too many bugs all over this one, but that the storyline and strategic bits are great.\n\nSo, recommended with a pinch of salt...","January 3","true","62.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For everyone hoping this was another Shadowrun: Dragonfall, well, it's not - but that's okay, because it's still a strong entry into the franchise.\n\nThere is nothing bad about SH:Hong Kong, the only complaints, are those of omissions when compared to it's predecessor.  You won't find multiple sources such as the Lodge lobby for your paydata - that's all going straight to Shadowland BBS.  Not every crew member has their own optional story quest either.  Unfortunately, you can't help a killer AI inhabit a dragon, but I guess you can't really catch lightning in a bottle twice there, now can you?  I wouldn't call the game shallow, because everyone introduced is afforded a good amount of creativity to their personal story.  It's just not to the same extent that we saw in Dragonfall.\n\nStill, the setting is intriguing, the characters are engaging, combat is fluid, and the overall eerie tone of the games voice resonates well.  Just saying teeth isn't scary - but the authorial description of 'too many teeth' and building slums, gnarling innward to consume you is... or it's at least unsettling.\n","November 23, 2015","true","46.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Excellent writing, a fantastic story way of the beaten path and memorable and interesting characters.\n\nThe system is basically from Dragfonfall with some improvements (the matrix especially looks WAY better), so all the limitations are also still there. Very limited customization and equipping of team members, very little freedom expect for the order in wich you do the runs. If that irked you before, it'll still do so now, I didn't mind a bit.\n\nThe combat system is still well executed and diverse, and every team member has interesting abilities to contribute. Fights are fun, and avoiding them by using other skills can be even more so.\n\nBuilding you own character is great as ever, and this is one of the few RPGs with a working economy. You'll never have enough money for ALL the goodies you'd really like...\n\nWhat really annoys a bit, however, are the bugs and glitches. Some left since Shadowrun returns.\n\n- Fights can get stuck on enemies' turn for several reasons, requiring a reload (enemies with no AP not acting and not being skipped, clouds of toxic gas not disappearing and not allowing you to end combat, dropped items freezing your action and so on). Really, folks, turn based games 101 says to always have an alternate trigger if one should fail...\n\n- the to hit number calculated and shown on screen is STILL utter bull****. I played 3.5 hours tonight and among many silly things I had 4 consecutive misses on a 78% chance *3* times - a 1 in 500 occurence. Once per hour. 70+ percent chances miss way to often <30% chances hit way too often. Always been this way since day 1 and never been really looked at.\n\nBut no gamestoppers and nothing that really spoils the fun wth this excellent story.","August 23, 2015","true","66.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Much more text then the previous two games that came before it.  After 15 hours so far I've done 3 missions, each about an hour in length, as I like to take my time.  The rest has been reading the tons and tons of lore.  An overwhelming amount, and some of it I actually spam click through.\n\nIf you're into a 5 to 1, lore to combat ratio type of game then this is for you.  If games with a lot of walls of text bore you, you may want to let this one pass you by or wait for it to go on sale for even cheaper.\n\n\n\nCLASS BUFFING AND NERFING SPOILERS AHEAD:\n\n\n\n\n\nShaman summoning got a buff this game.  Your shaman follower can no longer lose control of their spirit for the first 2 rounds of combat (if you choose the perk).  Personally I love this buff as I hated summoning in the previous games and only did it as an "Oh ♥♥♥♥" button. You can now use your Shaman's free fetish and give it +4 ap with 0% chance of it turning against you.  Also, Shamans can now STEAL enemy spirits.  Well my shaman can anyway I don't know if NPC's can steal my spirits but I have a perk that allows my Shaman to take theirs and with the no turning against the shaman for 2 turns perk this seems really powerful at the moment which Summon Shamans really needed imo.\n\nRigging got a buff as well.  A lot of cool new robots and the free rigger companion is actually useful now, I never took riggers in other games.\n\nDecking got some cool new tweaks to it also.  A cool new way of hacking once inside the matrix.  It no longer HAS to be enter the maxtrix fight fight fight get payday run run run jack out.  You can actually stealth in the matrix now and hacking once inside the matrix is also a thing. Hacking inside the matrix adds a cool new mini game, which feels almost like defusing a bomb.  IMO a nice change which I hope they continue in future games.\n\nStreet Samurais feel like they got nerfed.  Maybe I'm still "early" into the game as I've only done 3 missions, but every cyber upgrade is in the thousands and I make very little money per mission.  Which is odd considering hiring Mercanries seems like almost half my total payout now, so why would I ever go with the expensive mercs when the free comapions given are just that free? Seems really odd, and as of right now since money is so tight I'm saving every Nuyen I have for my next cyber upgrade on my Samurai.  Right now seems if you want to go full cyber-samurai Dragonfall Glori style the game punishes it due to how small the trickle of incoming money is.\n\nOverall I am enjoying the game.  If I had to recommend changes for the future I'd suggest going back to the Dragonfall amount of lore and add more money.  The amount of lore is beginning to feel like a bad Naruto filler episode...its there just to make the game longer and serves very little purpose otherwise.  As for the money I'd still like to see less money per mission then Dragonfall, but more then what I'm getting now as its very very litte.\n\nI'd like to be able to buy extra guns/fetishes/cyberdecks to loan to my followers like I did in Dragonfall, but right now MY character feels like he's still living in the Slums drinking 4 day old Soykaf with no pot to ♥♥♥♥ in.  I was actually in a mission where I could buy something for 200 Nuyen to advance the quest and I was so broke I literally laughed out loud at how high I thought the price was.  I had 14 Nuyen to my name.  Shadowrunning in Hong Kong doesn't pay...send halp!","December 28, 2015","true","35.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hong Kong is far from perfect though. If you're not familiar with the setting, the game is a lore heavy CRPG set in a cyberpunk/fantasy universe. Robots and elves. Expect a lot of neon.\n\nThe Good\n+ Strong writing and dialogue. Characters have a lot of depth, and the plot is intriguing.\n+ Fun and distinct class builds. Word of warning though, don't spread yourself too thin.\n+ Multiple ways to approach combat, puzzles, and scenarios (cover mechanics, brute force, skill checks, charisma, chilling out with spirits, etc.)\n+ Great art style.\n\nThe Not-So Good\n- A little too much text. This is subjective, and I personally like all the reading, but there is a ton of it and you may not be into that. It does affect the pacing. Luckily, most of it is optional.\n- Spelling errors. I've noticed more in Hong Kong than the previous games.\n- The new Matrix. In the previous games, the Matrix was basically standard combat with even more neon painted on it. It was boring. This time around, Harebrained Schemes added a stealth mechanic you can use, and a hacking mechanic that has you memorizing patterns of numbers. I really like the hacking part, because is feels more immersive for that kind of character. I've heard others complain that they don't want something that requires actual skill instead of your character's skill, which is a legit criticism. I will say this though- the stealth option kinda sucks. It requires precise clicking and timing to avoid cones of sight, and the game just isn't built for that. It's not responive enough. The changes in the Matrix are optional though, you can still just kill everything if you prefer,\n-I've heard reports of bugs. Haven't encountered anything major myself, but everyone's experience will differ.\n\nSummary- Punch people with a robot arm, read a short story, memorize a few numbers, then upgrade your robot arm.","December 28, 2015","true","52.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall the game was fun, although far worse than amazing Dragonfall.\n\n-Racter and Gaichu are great. Those two are among the most well written and interesting companions in the genre in recent memory. Both are quite morally ambiguous, shady and somehow maniacal. Talking with them is fun as well as reading their barks during missions.\n-Goblet was alright. HBS tried with her dialogues to mirror a way players were taught by Dak'kon in P:T and it was successful enough to be entertaining. I don't care about Duncan and I think Is0bel was bad. She might have been a good character but HBS went for too much drama in her lines and she became tiresome.\n-Many of new portraits are amazing, they are the best of all kickstarter cRPGs. They can even compete and win with Baldurs Gate 1 portraits.\n-Writing was pretty good. Kindly Cheng scenes often felt quite menacing. Sometimes the writing feels it was suffering from graphomania, and the game is badly paced.\n-Story starts really strong, even better than Dragonfall. And then it stops. Game forgets PC is hunted by the police and let him go to the parties and do his businesses. Until endgame the story is nearly completely abandoned. There are less endings than in Dragonfall and there is a lack of wonder if choices made were correct.\n-The lack of the Lodge and Schsssomething miniquests makes runs far worse. Loved that those quest were often in conflict with each other and made runs far more varied and richer in C&C.\n-New augmentations system was fun. The choices are now quite big, we have new slots and I liked weapons like a whip of being overpowered.\n-Dragonfall had a really good encounter design. APEX mission was it highlight. Hong Kong only good encounters are the ambush in the first mission, the boss fight and a battle in the tomb raiding mission. From which only the last 2 are not questionable.\n-Runs were often very good conceptually but weakly designed. Great example of that was Feng Shui run where the player is tasked with sabotaging the company Feng Shui flow. It's done by clicking on things...\n-Combat difficulty was lowered. Very High setting was cut from the game.\n-Most encounters are skipable. Sounds great? Never have I thought it is possible to use this feature to make the game worse. Actually I think it is the first time ever something like this has happened in the cRPG genre. How it failed? It is because skipping combat is easy, does not require much player input. It actually felt I was naturally drifting towards peaceful resolutions which takes fun out of outsmarting foes. I honestly and non cynically think HBS has added something to the pool of knowledge of cRPGs design by this mistake.\n-Music was ok, but not as great as Dragonfall. Visuals were an improvement from previous installments.\n-New matrix was a total letdown. Instead of improving it, HBS made it worse. Was actually cursing when playing it, cannot imagine how somebody thought the design was good and was not slapped for it by his colleagues. Gone are the simultaneous meatspace/matrix battles, instead we have minigames.","January 5","true","70.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The base system was solid though, and it captures the lore of Shadowrun very well, so even with limited playability it was a solid game.\n\nDragonfall mastered the problems of the first game and made it a truly great game. Great story, characters, more challenge. The way it is constructed reminds me a lot of Mass Effect 2-3 games though, heh. Suppose it is because you get to choose which mission to do next, and between the mission you go to your base and talk to your crew, which will make you know about them better and build up your relations. And get their character missions etc.\n\nSo the latest/last part to the new Shadowrun games, Hong Kong. After the great Dragonfall, they had to try hard to surpass themselves. In fact, the biggest problem of this game is, that they probably tried too hard. Way too hard in some aspects.\n\nThe progression and spacing of the game is just completely broken, compared to most RPG games. You will do a fun but short mission in 20-40 mins, after which you will go to your base city and talk with your crew and other NPCs to learn about their past and opinions... for hours. After every single mission.  They have given a detailed backstory to every NPC in the game, and they sure didnt cut anything out of it, but it all is told to you in very bloaten, repetitive and overly detailed way. The ammount of past stories the characters have is just too much. Its hard to get focus on what part of those backstories they blabber about are meaningful, so at some point you will stop caring at all. But since talking to your crew is also a way to unlock their quests, and sometimes actually interesting as well, you still have to force yourself to read through the thousands of lines of their past history with their past friends. Its shame they didnt just edit the text more and focus on writing what is important instead of just writing every single thing they can come up with, as the characters themselves are super interesting. The Russian rigger is one of the most interesting characters I`ve ever seen in RPGs.\n\nEven though I dont mind some reading, I still see games more of an visual media like films are. When you have a story you want to tell; show it, dont tell it. If Hong Kong was a movie, it would be a 5 hours long movie where characters talk about their past yet you are never shown it but just the faces of the characters talking. If the game actually took you to their past and let you play through them, well that would have been incredible. Obviously it wouldnt have been possible to their budget and time, since the game would need 10x more locations in it then...\n\nAnother problem is, that while the missions are super fun and varied in settings, combat wise the game is way too easy even on Hard. Most of the missions only have 1-2, or even 0 combat situations in them. I think I only had to use 1 medkit in the whole game. In later stages where you get 3 AP instead of beginning 2, your team will be next to invincible and its rare that you get hit even once if you utilize tactics even a bit. The game just lacks balls to throw enough strong opponents at you, it just throws the handfull of 3-5 all from 1 direction, which are then easily taken care of, even if you gimp your main character with poor choices. Only hard parts are in the computer world of Matrix, which are hair-pullingly irritating when you dont play as a decker yourself but need to use the NPC decker. Had to do some annoying save&load in some of those. They are not fun either, as controlling 1 character in simple turn-based tactical combat really doesnt give you many tactical possibilities.\n\nBecause of how easy the battles are, you really are not encouraged to play the game again with different classes, even though in theory you could play the game in 20+ very different type of characters. The ammount of dialogue between the missions furthermore gimps your interest in giving it a second playthrough. Which is shame. The game has excellent world, full of interesting people, nice grapchis and sound and atmosphere.

It all adds up to create a lively environment that doesn't just feel like a static set.\n\nI also love the changes made to the Matrix.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Korlis/recommended/346940/","Korlis","Korlis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Korlis/","370 products in account","This is is the pinnacle of Harebrained Schemes' take on Shadowrun, building on the shaky-but-promising foundations of Shadowrun Returns and the excellent follow-up, Dragonfall. Like its predecessors, SR: Hong Kong is a narrative-based tactical RPG born out of the pen-and-paper Shadowrun setting. The Hong Kong location gives things a different flavour, sufficiently differentiating it from the other two games, but what really sets it apart is the extra attention paid to the NPC runner crew. Shadowrun Returns had only a couple of returning characters, while Dragonfall introduced a true party of the kind you'd expect to find in most computer RPGs. Hong Kong takes that and runs with it, and I think a large part of what you get out of the game will depend on how attached you become to the characters. For me, Hong Kong is easily my favourite of the three games, though I still need to go back and play the Director's Cut of Dragonfall.\n\nGameplay-wise, things are mostly similar to the other Shadowrun games, but the interface is further refined, while cyberware and Matrix hacking have seen a lot of attention. The Matrix work in particular makes playing a decker a lot more interesting, and the hacking minigame for cracking blocker IC is pretty neat. It's a lengthy story, too, especially with the Shadows of Hong Kong mini-campaign added with the Extended Edition. At time of writing, that epilogue campaign seems a little rough around the edges, but is a welcome follow-up with a couple of interesting runs.\n\nFor the right kind of gamer, I really couldn't recommend this enough.","February 19","true","38.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is at its most beautiful, music is great, combat is crisp, missions diverse and interesting. Atmosphere sucks you in and you really feel the tension building up to something as the game progresses. The best part? I wasn't disappointed with the conclusion at all. Personally, I find the characters somewhat more alive and peculiar than Dragonfall ones. The game is also more liberal with karma points than Dragonfall so I don't feel as forced into metagaming and can actually allow myself sculpting a roleplayed person and still be an effective runner.\n\nThat being said, there's also one major downside that hurts replayability. Harebrained really went overboard with text and exposition to the point where it feels as if you're spending more time reading than doing actual runs. Even if you click through most conversations it still takes a lot of time to visit everyone between missions. This makes Dragonfall feel much more focused and intense. (In particular I feel the whole Ka Fai family business could've and should've been cut. Maybe Spider Shen too.)\n\nOne more minor gripe of mine is that the engine isn't particularly well suited for the new stealth mechanics in the matrix and one of the missions. It's bearable at best, but some of the more tricky and complex sections had me savescumming in frustration at how my character was moving. Although overall I like the new matrix minigame. It certainly makes me feel more engaged.\n\nThese two issues are why I wouldn't rate the game at 10 (for the record, I named Dragonfall Director's Cut my game of the year for 2014). But then again, despite these the game is certainly worth at least one playthrough for the story and definitely more if you're into Shadowrun and/or turn based combat by Harebrained. Can't wait for the promised mini-expansion.","December 14, 2015","true","122.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Wish there was more content though, it feels a little short to me.

And while the bonus campaign is definitely shorter than the main campaign (as was announced beforehand), I was surprised at the length and the presence of side quest. One of the side quest provided one of the - in my opinion - most memorable stand-offs. Of course, depending on how you chose.\nSo I was again masterfully entertained - until the end. The end left me rather unhappy. While it did have plausible choices - there was an obvious, additional, only slightly different choice missing. Obviously, this being a comment on the ending, here come the spoilers...\n\nBasically the choices are Qiu, Cheng and a middleground. While the extrems feel right, the middleground lacks subleties. Especially, if your character (like mine) was not only story-wise the face of the group but also accordingly skilled: With enough charisma (or the right etiquette) it should have been possible to choose burning the warehouse while letting Qiu live AND plead for Duncan to still get a SIN. Not only did my character have enough charisma to pull this off, there could have been a few lines of thinking up how to still produce evidence for Qiu before setting everything on fire. With that it would make sense for Qiu to stick to only half her promised payment - Duncan's SIN.\nTo me, this slight variation seems pretty self-evident - and it doesn't seem to be too difficult to implement with a little bit of work. So despite the game being the solid and fun Shadowrun experience you know and can expect of Harebrained Schemes, this detail at the very end left a slightly unsatisfactory aftertaste.","February 7","true","84.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I hated playing the Mage in the previous games, had tons of fun doing so in this game, particularly to improved ley lines which clearly make a difference this time. Matrix is more stealth-focused, requires the decker to avoid detection from constantly patrolling cameras and has them perform a hacking mini-game based on remembering numbers / symbols. Though if one dislikes it, they could just run through the cameras and force their way through, which will cause hostile ICs to arrive.\n\nThe game's main disadvantage would be the amount of bugs in the game, like items not doing what they advertise (specifically adding stats).

Story was great and the gameplay is pretty much exactly like Returns and Dragonfall. I did prefer the new matrix changes in this game though. I felt like this game had A LOT more dialog and reading and in some cases it felt like it took forever to get to some combat, a minor nitpick and not really a complaint. My only complaint would be a few mission bugs I came across where I had to start the mission all over again or a couple saves being corrupted and having to rewind a bit and start over, that was annoying and I reverted to save spamming to avoid backtracking so far. If you play this game with a high resolution I highly recommend you change the HUD to support it. I played a few hours before I realized you could make everything larger and was suffering from headaches every time I played, once I made the change it was much better. I backed all three games and I would definitely back a 4th if they have plans.\n\nI would love to see Shadowrun get a 3rd person RPG game, fully customize characters look, cloths, gear etc. I think it would be so awesome to visually see your character in full detail go through all the changes of the various upgrades.\n\nBuy it and play it.\n\n*Update: Finished the campaign addition around 6-7 hours. Yup fantastic just as the rest. I love these games and always want more when I’m done. There is just something about the Shadowrun lore that I absolutely love. From playing the paper games growing up to the console games, the books (The Dragon Heart Saga especially) and now these newer games it’s like pure retro heaven for me. Not much to add accept this addition does tie up some loose ends really nicely, obviously the story is awesome and there are some really intense battles packed in here. I can’t wait to see what the future hold for these games.\n\nGood Job","September 14, 2015","true","37.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many RPGs profess to let you build your character and play the way you want, but Shadowrun Hong Kong delivers in ways that other games do not. There are a variety of intriguing character options from spirit-summoning street shaman to hacker drone commander to cyborg warrior. In terms of character personality and history, the story lets you flesh out your character's backstory through dialogue in surprising ways. Most importantly, you can play through virtually any mission without violence if you select the correct dialogue options and your character is skilled and charismatic enough. This is a role-playing game in the purest sense,\n\nThere's more than one way to skin a cat in Shadowrun Hong Kong, and I found myself reloading misions to try them all. Particular standouts for me are the mission where you solve a murder mystery in one of Hong Kong's tech district and the mission which requires you to infiltrate a party hosted by TV serial producer who has a mysterious new girlfriend.\n\nMost of the characters you recruit are fairly intriguing; true to the genre they have dark secrets in their past that come back to haunt them in one way or another. Conversations with your teammates are alternately thought-provoking and comedic, depending on who you talk to. The game is incredibly text-heavy, if you do not enjoy reading or dislike Hamnett-esque noir prose, this is not a game for you.\n\nI was also impressed by the game's respectful use of Chinese culture. The game draws heavily on Hong Kong action film stereotypes and settings, but the writing suggests a familiarity and depth of research beyond a few viewings of Hard Boiled and Infernal Affairs.","December 7, 2015","true","41.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall the game was fun, although far worse than amazing Dragonfall.\n\n-Racter and Gaichu are great. Those two are among the most well written and interesting companions in the genre in recent memory. Both are quite morally ambiguous, shady and somehow maniacal. Talking with them is fun as well as reading their barks during missions.\n-Goblet was alright. HBS tried with her dialogues to mirror a way players were taught by Dak'kon in P:T and it was successful enough to be entertaining. I don't care about Duncan and I think Is0bel was bad. She might have been a good character but HBS went for too much drama in her lines and she became tiresome.\n-Many of new portraits are amazing, they are the best of all kickstarter cRPGs. They can even compete and win with Baldurs Gate 1 portraits.\n-Writing was pretty good. Kindly Cheng scenes often felt quite menacing. Sometimes the writing feels it was suffering from graphomania, and the game is badly paced.\n-Story starts really strong, even better than Dragonfall. And then it stops. Game forgets PC is hunted by the police and let him go to the parties and do his businesses. Until endgame the story is nearly completely abandoned. There are less endings than in Dragonfall and there is a lack of wonder if choices made were correct.\n-The lack of the Lodge and Schsssomething miniquests makes runs far worse. Loved that those quest were often in conflict with each other and made runs far more varied and richer in C&C.\n-New augmentations system was fun. The choices are now quite big, we have new slots and I liked weapons like a whip of being overpowered.\n-Dragonfall had a really good encounter design. APEX mission was it highlight. Hong Kong only good encounters are the ambush in the first mission, the boss fight and a battle in the tomb raiding mission. From which only the last 2 are not questionable.\n-Runs were often very good conceptually but weakly designed. Great example of that was Feng Shui run where the player is tasked with sabotaging the company Feng Shui flow. It's done by clicking on things...\n-Combat difficulty was lowered. Very High setting was cut from the game.\n-Most encounters are skipable. Sounds great? Never have I thought it is possible to use this feature to make the game worse. Actually I think it is the first time ever something like this has happened in the cRPG genre. How it failed? It is because skipping combat is easy, does not require much player input. It actually felt I was naturally drifting towards peaceful resolutions which takes fun out of outsmarting foes. I honestly and non cynically think HBS has added something to the pool of knowledge of cRPGs design by this mistake.\n-Music was ok, but not as great as Dragonfall. Visuals were an improvement from previous installments.\n-New matrix was a total letdown. Instead of improving it, HBS made it worse. Was actually cursing when playing it, cannot imagine how somebody thought the design was good and was not slapped for it by his colleagues. Gone are the simultaneous meatspace/matrix battles, instead we have minigames.","January 5","true","70.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

THE UI is revamped and the graphics are more polished, yet the same core mechanics as its predecessor.\n\nstory:\n\nas i said, the mystery sucks you right away, and the writing is incredibly sharp, with a lot of description text, great dialogue and various kind of responses to ensure top role-playing experience. i haven't gotten far yet, but i can say the intro wants me to know more, delve deeper into it. the characters are so far really great, useful in combat and have intriguing personality. yet, this is all i can say for now.\n\ngameplay and mechanics:\npretty much the same as before. your skills are governed by stats, you have several classes to pick to (including custom class) and the combat is X-COM enemy unknow-esque turn based combat. nothing stood out too much yet, but really entertaining on its own.\n\ngraphics and music:\n\nlike it's predecessor, this game has 3D character sprites over beautifully, detailed hand drawn 2D background. what i noticed is animation, effects, 3D models and textures are vastly improved over the first 2 games. they are not state of the art level graphics, but quite pleasant to look at. the 2D background resolution is noticeably higher and you can zoom in much further than previous games.\n\nthe music still live up to this game's older siblings. ambient, and atmospheric tunes that fit the grim, cyberpunk dystopia that shadowrun series are set. combined with the graphics, i can say the game provide top-notch atmosphere and immersion.\n\nflaws:\nwith all of that good points, nothing is perfect, and so is this game. i've noticed the revamped UI, especially the skill page is a step down from previous games. the description of stats and skills are put above the clunky looking spreadsheet, and it's kinda sore to look at. so far it's the most galring flaw of this game, but all things considered, i think shadowrun hong kong is a worthy successor of the shadowrun franchise. good job for HBS and their hard work for reviving this unique RPG.\n\nthis review will be updated as i play trough the game further.","August 20, 2015","true","43.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Here is the thing though, I feel like a lot of the reviews on steam are *really* overselling it. It is not gods gift to Shadowrun, and a lot of the time, I would say that it feels really half-♥♥♥♥♥.\nI tried to look at this game objectivly, but every time I got really into it a little voice in the back of my mide would normally say something like "This is good, but ya know, it aint Dragonfall". The story is not as good as in Dragonfall, most of the characters are not as good (I said most, not all) and it just feels less like a project that the devs really cared about.\nAnd that is when it occured to me. Critics loved Dragonfall and it was a huge success, it was such a big deal that they went on to make a director's cut and get even more money with the addition of new missions, and this time that is what they are planning on doing. They are selling a game that is obviously missing something, and are later gonna sell it as DLC or a new edition or something. There are even character dialogues that just scream "SIDE QUEST" and end up going nowhere.\nAs for the new features some fall flat like the new stealth system which is real clunky and kinda dumb, and the non lethal takedowns that are available for one party member are basically just another way of killing things but the bodies just kinda wiggle around on the floor. The only big new thing that is worth mentioning is the matrix, but holly nut-balls is it a heck of a lot better than the old one, and it kinda makes matrix stuff more fun than meat-space stuff, not to say that meat space suff isnt fun either. The atmosphere is also very well done and a lot of the new runs are quite interesting and not just "Go to this place, kill these dudes, then do the thingy"\nOverall, it is a good game for $20 and will keep out Shadowrun urges in check while you wait for your GOD DAMN PARTY LEADER WHO IS AWAY FOR THE SUMMER SO WE CAN'T PLAY THE TABLETOP VERSION UNTIL HE GETS BACK. Also I feel like some of my experience was ruined due to me playing as an adept, so I think after writing this I will go back and try playing as a decker.","August 24, 2015","true","30.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I can thoroughly recommend it to previous players, although I would say that, personally, I feel Dragonfall was the better game. And to interested parties who have never experienced a Shadowrun game before, I would say to go and try Dragonfall before trying Hong Kong: while I really enjoyed Hong Kong, I think a new player would get much more out of Dragonfall.\n\nShadowrun: Hong Kong plays like a rather standard tactical RPG. You create a main character, load him up with whatever stats you want (I prefer a gun-toting Bear Shaman, who can place barriers as personal cover to snipe from long distances, Haste himself to shoot up to two times more often per round, and use the Bear totem for the game's only AoE heal). You have a group of pre-determined party members, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In addition, each mission provides you with a list of alternate Shadowrunners you can take instead of your standard party members, although why you would do this remains a mystery to me.\n\nSaid party members, I feel, are one of the ways Hong Kong falls flat compared to Dragonfall. Granted, several of Dragonfall's party members didn't have fleshed out stories until the Director's Cut update, but since it DOES have a Director's Cut update, that's what I have to compare Hong Kong to, and most of HK's party isn't as interesting comparatively. Duncan's story is hamstrung by the fact that it has to be tied into the main character's backstory; he doesn't have a defined history, you make up half of it as you go along, and that prevents him from being an interesting character in his own right. Gobbet's history is really only barely touched upon, and her personal mission, if you can refer to it as such, doesn't have much emotional weight (certainly not as much emotional weight as Glory's personal mission, and the comparison has to be made because of how similar the two are). is0bel is the most disappointing in this regard. Out of the entire cast she had the most potential to have an emotional effect on the player, but it's just squandered. Her personal mission happens before her storyline really even starts, killing any possibility of true connection or closure. Racter doesn't even really have his own mission, he simply requests to tag along on mission you already have, and his personal connection to the mission is barely there at all.\n\nThe story, however, makes up for the characters in many ways. The change in location to Hong Kong is welcome, given that both prior games had decidedly Western locations and aesthetics. Hong Kong brings with it a new subject in the form of qi, the lifeforce that drives much of Hong Kong's magic and forms a focal point for both the main story and several of the side missions. I was a little disappointed with how similar Heoi, the main city, was to the hub in Dragonfall. However, several of the characters are great. I especially liked Ambrose and Crafty Xu (fans of the series may be interested to note that Aljernon is NOT the proprietor of the magic shop in this title; I was never really a fan and much prefer Crafty Xu, personally). The main story fades into the background for large sections of the game while you run various jobs, which I felt was a little strange. Dragonfall set up the goal very early on, and every side job was a means to that end; while the missions were all disconnected, you knew why you were doing them and they all served a definite purpose to the main goal. In HK, you're basically just Shadowrunning because you have no other choice, and the missions you take have almost no bearing in any situation on the main story or your party's situation. And the ending is a major letdown, too.\n\nLuckily, the gameplay is as good as ever, for the most part. There are tons of dialogue options available to the player (although this comes with its own negative, which I'll get into later), giving you the option to avoid several fights, if that's your prerogative. Many problems the game presents have several solutions; combat is always one of them, and often times it is a requirement, but not always. The difficulty curve is fair, keeping things entertaining with some level of difficulty, until about 75% of the way through the game where your party will simply power through everything if you've built it right. This is especially evident for the final boss fights, which were almost criminally easy.\n\nHowever, the same targeting issues I've had with the series since Shadowrun Returns still haven't been fixed. Due to the game's isometric camera, it can be infuriatingly difficult at times to select the tile you're looking for. If the tile you want to move to is behind a crate and another character, you can spend a lot of time waving your mouse around trying to get the selector to acknowledge the tile and not the cover (or character) in front of it. I had really expected this to be fixed somehow by the third game. This wouldn't be as aggravating if the game had some way to reverse a command, but once your character moves you're stuck with whatever you've done; accidentally command your character to attack an enemy, when all you really wanted to do was move to the tile behind him, and you might find yourself unfairly down a Shadowrunner.\n\nAnother problem endemic to the series are the dialogue options. Earlier on I praised the game for giving you so many, but now I have to raise a gripe that I had with Returns and Dragonfall: the main character, in order to experience much of the dialog, is basically forced into leveling Charisma in order to get Etiquettes. Why is my main character FORCED into having Security etiquette if I want to use this speech option even though I have Duncan in the party? He's an ex-Lone Star, which is basically the police force; why can HE not bring up this rather obvious point? Why do I have to be the one to do it? Gobbett spends half of the game lording over you the fact that she's been Shadowrunning for years and you're a newbie; why do I have to choose this Shadowrunner Etiquette dialogue option while she's in the party? It's mind-boggling. Additionally, giving party members Etiquettes would add another layer of complexity into forming a party.\n\nMy next gripe is with the new decking mechanics. I understand why there was a call for a new format; decking in previous games was basically the exact same gameplay as the standard tactical combat (hide behind cover and shoot at enemies), and it shouldnt be. It should be different, and I applaud the decision and effort to shake it up. However, I feel the new mechanics are even worse. Decking is now, in large part, a stealth section; the decker moves around attempting to avoid entering the LoS of enemies; if one spots you, you enter combat, and if you're in combat long enough you set of a system alert (I'm simplifying it a little, but that's the gist). However, the game is NOT set up for stealth sections. They simply don't feel right. There's one "stealth" section in one side mission, and that is redeemed (SLIGHTLY) by the fact that you can enter turn-based mode and therefore have more control over character movement and cover; this option is missing while decking, and this combined with the floaty movement end up causing you to enter combat far more often than you probably should. I was so annoyed with the new decking mechanics that I simply avoided decking where possible.\n\nI'll reiterate what I said in the opening: I really enjoyed HK. I enjoyed Dragonfall more, and I would point interested players to play that title first, but this is certainly a great game and, despite my gripes, I have no qualms recommending it.","August 25, 2015","true","24.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The mechanics have been adjusted (mages have been rightfully nerfed and decking runs very differently now), and that's OK. The studio is making adjustments based upon how people have responded to the previous games. If Hong Kong suffers from anything (aside from numerous text bugs) it is that as the third game, its story formula is starting to feel stale. Where the story is still good, it is following the same pattern as before. That and copious extraneous text has actually left me bored and skipping text that I wouldn't have in an earlier game.\n\nAlso, decking needs to go. I really wasn't a fan of it in table top. It meant the GM dealt with one character exclusively while everyone else waited around. The computer game doesn't suffere from that. Instead it suffers from it being equal measures boring and frustrating. Sometimes there's just a dialog choice to hack an interface. This is wonderful because it moves the plot along and makes you feel like your karma (copious karma in this case) was well spent. A five to ten minute aside that climaxes in a ten key version of Simon just makes me want to skip decking altogether. And since decking is both so specialized and not a regular occurance, you are discouraged from playing that sort of a character rather than a straight combat monkey.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you like the Shadowrun world or you just like this style of game, then Shadowrun: Hong Kong is totally for you.

The Matrix has been revamped, perhaps not entirely sucessfully, but it feels more dangerous and more exciting than the old Matrix system did where you were essentially a hacker god no matter what kind of deck you ran. Cyberware has been greatly expanded, allowing you to build a very cool street sam. Companions are now actually useful and can more than hold their own in combat, which means that your character finally does not have to focus so much attention on being able to kill everything in sight just to pick up the slack from your crappy team members. The missions seem to have more varied goals and other solutions, and take you through a nicely varied set of set pieces and some beautiful scenery. A lot of the fights in game can be bypassed through use of varied skills and etiquettes, and there are multiple outcomes to a lot of the scenarios. All of the NPCs also seem to have a bit more to say, so if you like reading a lot of lore and exposition, you'll be happy here. All of this is great. (The one sad thing is that Mages and Adepts are really still just kind of terrible, adepts especially. Why they can't come up with a way to make Mages as dangerous and powerful as they are in the PnP game is beyond me. It can't be THAT hard to put a 'drain' system into the unity engine, can it? Your mage is still just casting Haste and Aim on your street sams over and over again to be useful.)\n\nYet the problem with Hong Kong is its story. Throughout the entire game, it commits the most deadly of movie/game sins, in that it doesn't follow the "Show me, don't tell me" rule. The story is about this one particular neighborhood (called the Walled City) in Hong Kong that is, in essence, being cursed. People keep telling you how god awful it is in there, how lives are worth nothing, how there's this palpable aura of despair and misery in the entire area, etc etc etc.\n\nWell, great. Why should I care? You see, the game TELLS you all of this, but never actually SHOWS it to you. One of your earliest missions is to go into the Walled City on some minor Yakuza run, and the worst thing you see is that some punk steals an old man's credstick. Oh noes! (It's even more pathetic than it sounds, because you can actually get the punk to give the credstick back.) And that's it. Other than that it looks like a few random streets. And then you never, ever go back there other than for the final mission. So again, why do I care about this place? It's certainly not Chicago. Where are the missions that show me just how terrible everything is? Where is the dark, morally ambiguous run that makes me SEE just what a hellhole it really is? Something in the Walled City is giving you and everyone else nightmares, but those nightmares are just small snippets of text and stuff told to you by NPCs. Again, SHOW ME, don't TELL ME.\n\n(There's some attempt to get you to care about the Walled City because of Random NPC Who Dies Or Maybe He Didn't Die Who Is Important To You, who is tied in some weird way to the area but that's just a crappy style of writing that has never worked before in any game of any kind, and it doesn't work here either. At all. I couldn't give two craps what happens to "Raymond" nor why he was trying to enter the Walled City.)\n\nThis premise is simply not capable of carrying the story, yet it is being asked to do so. It's at most good enough for a side mission, not for the plot of an entire game. I kept waiting for the actual story to get going, except it never did. You have to do some missions for the Yakuza, I kept waiting for the big twist to hit and the real story to start, and it never does. You do about 10 missions, and then suddenly "WARNING, YOU'RE ENTERING THE FINAL PART OF THE STORY!"\n\nReally? This is it? This is literally what the whole story is about? A slum that your character has never heard of and doesn't give two sheets about? What if I'm playing a morally corrupt Shadowrunner. Why would said shadowrunner even bother? I'd just get on the next boat out of town.\n\nThe best way to illustrate how bad it is is in the main antagonist: Where in Dragonfall the entire time you're planning to go up against a freaking Great Dragon that had all of Germany wetting itself daily, in Hong Kong for the longest time your big adversary is: A guy with a plastic mask. Seriously, that's it. He's even called Plastic Face Man. It's like the game is deliberately trolling you at this point. Then when you meet him, he's even more pathetic than you already imagined him to be. The KE security squad that comes to his rescue is a far bigger threat than he himself is.\n\n(To be fair, the actual big bad is revealed after that, but still, it doesn't exactly make for a 'tip of your seat' experience. And the real big bad is essentially the boogy man from a children's story, so I found it kind of hard to even be worried about that.)\n\nThe whole thing just feels like a set of (some very good) missions strung together while the devs just couldn't really come up with any way to make them into an over arching story. It was honestly quite boring, story wise.\n\nStill, the missions are good, the systems work smoothly, combat is fun, your companions are good, you can find some cool ways around problems, so if you ignore all the whining about the Walled City and just scroll through it quickly, you can still have a good time here.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that if you enjoyed the previous two shadowruns, you'll enjoy this as well, but it's really the weakest of the three. Maybe pick it up on sale at some point. I'll give it a thumbs up because the systems have been smoothed out, and because I'd hate for this to be the last one that HareBrained makes, but just be warned that it if you're expecting Dragonfall 2, you're not going to get it. Not by a long way. I really hope they'll take another shot at it in the future.","November 7, 2015","true","30.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The mechanics have been adjusted (mages have been rightfully nerfed and decking runs very differently now), and that's OK. The studio is making adjustments based upon how people have responded to the previous games. If Hong Kong suffers from anything (aside from numerous text bugs) it is that as the third game, its story formula is starting to feel stale. Where the story is still good, it is following the same pattern as before. That and copious extraneous text has actually left me bored and skipping text that I wouldn't have in an earlier game.\n\nAlso, decking needs to go. I really wasn't a fan of it in table top. It meant the GM dealt with one character exclusively while everyone else waited around. The computer game doesn't suffere from that. Instead it suffers from it being equal measures boring and frustrating. Sometimes there's just a dialog choice to hack an interface. This is wonderful because it moves the plot along and makes you feel like your karma (copious karma in this case) was well spent. A five to ten minute aside that climaxes in a ten key version of Simon just makes me want to skip decking altogether. And since decking is both so specialized and not a regular occurance, you are discouraged from playing that sort of a character rather than a straight combat monkey.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you like the Shadowrun world or you just like this style of game, then Shadowrun: Hong Kong is totally for you.

Here is the thing though, I feel like a lot of the reviews on steam are *really* overselling it. It is not gods gift to Shadowrun, and a lot of the time, I would say that it feels really half-♥♥♥♥♥.\nI tried to look at this game objectivly, but every time I got really into it a little voice in the back of my mide would normally say something like "This is good, but ya know, it aint Dragonfall". The story is not as good as in Dragonfall, most of the characters are not as good (I said most, not all) and it just feels less like a project that the devs really cared about.\nAnd that is when it occured to me. Critics loved Dragonfall and it was a huge success, it was such a big deal that they went on to make a director's cut and get even more money with the addition of new missions, and this time that is what they are planning on doing. They are selling a game that is obviously missing something, and are later gonna sell it as DLC or a new edition or something. There are even character dialogues that just scream "SIDE QUEST" and end up going nowhere.\nAs for the new features some fall flat like the new stealth system which is real clunky and kinda dumb, and the non lethal takedowns that are available for one party member are basically just another way of killing things but the bodies just kinda wiggle around on the floor. The only big new thing that is worth mentioning is the matrix, but holly nut-balls is it a heck of a lot better than the old one, and it kinda makes matrix stuff more fun than meat-space stuff, not to say that meat space suff isnt fun either. The atmosphere is also very well done and a lot of the new runs are quite interesting and not just "Go to this place, kill these dudes, then do the thingy"\nOverall, it is a good game for $20 and will keep out Shadowrun urges in check while you wait for your GOD DAMN PARTY LEADER WHO IS AWAY FOR THE SUMMER SO WE CAN'T PLAY THE TABLETOP VERSION UNTIL HE GETS BACK. Also I feel like some of my experience was ruined due to me playing as an adept, so I think after writing this I will go back and try playing as a decker.","August 24, 2015","true","30.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I can thoroughly recommend it to previous players, although I would say that, personally, I feel Dragonfall was the better game. And to interested parties who have never experienced a Shadowrun game before, I would say to go and try Dragonfall before trying Hong Kong: while I really enjoyed Hong Kong, I think a new player would get much more out of Dragonfall.\n\nShadowrun: Hong Kong plays like a rather standard tactical RPG. You create a main character, load him up with whatever stats you want (I prefer a gun-toting Bear Shaman, who can place barriers as personal cover to snipe from long distances, Haste himself to shoot up to two times more often per round, and use the Bear totem for the game's only AoE heal). You have a group of pre-determined party members, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In addition, each mission provides you with a list of alternate Shadowrunners you can take instead of your standard party members, although why you would do this remains a mystery to me.\n\nSaid party members, I feel, are one of the ways Hong Kong falls flat compared to Dragonfall. Granted, several of Dragonfall's party members didn't have fleshed out stories until the Director's Cut update, but since it DOES have a Director's Cut update, that's what I have to compare Hong Kong to, and most of HK's party isn't as interesting comparatively. Duncan's story is hamstrung by the fact that it has to be tied into the main character's backstory; he doesn't have a defined history, you make up half of it as you go along, and that prevents him from being an interesting character in his own right. Gobbet's history is really only barely touched upon, and her personal mission, if you can refer to it as such, doesn't have much emotional weight (certainly not as much emotional weight as Glory's personal mission, and the comparison has to be made because of how similar the two are). is0bel is the most disappointing in this regard. Out of the entire cast she had the most potential to have an emotional effect on the player, but it's just squandered. Her personal mission happens before her storyline really even starts, killing any possibility of true connection or closure. Racter doesn't even really have his own mission, he simply requests to tag along on mission you already have, and his personal connection to the mission is barely there at all.\n\nThe story, however, makes up for the characters in many ways. The change in location to Hong Kong is welcome, given that both prior games had decidedly Western locations and aesthetics. Hong Kong brings with it a new subject in the form of qi, the lifeforce that drives much of Hong Kong's magic and forms a focal point for both the main story and several of the side missions. I was a little disappointed with how similar Heoi, the main city, was to the hub in Dragonfall. However, several of the characters are great. I especially liked Ambrose and Crafty Xu (fans of the series may be interested to note that Aljernon is NOT the proprietor of the magic shop in this title; I was never really a fan and much prefer Crafty Xu, personally). The main story fades into the background for large sections of the game while you run various jobs, which I felt was a little strange. Dragonfall set up the goal very early on, and every side job was a means to that end; while the missions were all disconnected, you knew why you were doing them and they all served a definite purpose to the main goal. In HK, you're basically just Shadowrunning because you have no other choice, and the missions you take have almost no bearing in any situation on the main story or your party's situation. And the ending is a major letdown, too.\n\nLuckily, the gameplay is as good as ever, for the most part. There are tons of dialogue options available to the player (although this comes with its own negative, which I'll get into later), giving you the option to avoid several fights, if that's your prerogative. Many problems the game presents have several solutions; combat is always one of them, and often times it is a requirement, but not always. The difficulty curve is fair, keeping things entertaining with some level of difficulty, until about 75% of the way through the game where your party will simply power through everything if you've built it right. This is especially evident for the final boss fights, which were almost criminally easy.\n\nHowever, the same targeting issues I've had with the series since Shadowrun Returns still haven't been fixed. Due to the game's isometric camera, it can be infuriatingly difficult at times to select the tile you're looking for. If the tile you want to move to is behind a crate and another character, you can spend a lot of time waving your mouse around trying to get the selector to acknowledge the tile and not the cover (or character) in front of it. I had really expected this to be fixed somehow by the third game. This wouldn't be as aggravating if the game had some way to reverse a command, but once your character moves you're stuck with whatever you've done; accidentally command your character to attack an enemy, when all you really wanted to do was move to the tile behind him, and you might find yourself unfairly down a Shadowrunner.\n\nAnother problem endemic to the series are the dialogue options. Earlier on I praised the game for giving you so many, but now I have to raise a gripe that I had with Returns and Dragonfall: the main character, in order to experience much of the dialog, is basically forced into leveling Charisma in order to get Etiquettes. Why is my main character FORCED into having Security etiquette if I want to use this speech option even though I have Duncan in the party? He's an ex-Lone Star, which is basically the police force; why can HE not bring up this rather obvious point? Why do I have to be the one to do it? Gobbett spends half of the game lording over you the fact that she's been Shadowrunning for years and you're a newbie; why do I have to choose this Shadowrunner Etiquette dialogue option while she's in the party? It's mind-boggling. Additionally, giving party members Etiquettes would add another layer of complexity into forming a party.\n\nMy next gripe is with the new decking mechanics. I understand why there was a call for a new format; decking in previous games was basically the exact same gameplay as the standard tactical combat (hide behind cover and shoot at enemies), and it shouldnt be. It should be different, and I applaud the decision and effort to shake it up. However, I feel the new mechanics are even worse. Decking is now, in large part, a stealth section; the decker moves around attempting to avoid entering the LoS of enemies; if one spots you, you enter combat, and if you're in combat long enough you set of a system alert (I'm simplifying it a little, but that's the gist). However, the game is NOT set up for stealth sections. They simply don't feel right. There's one "stealth" section in one side mission, and that is redeemed (SLIGHTLY) by the fact that you can enter turn-based mode and therefore have more control over character movement and cover; this option is missing while decking, and this combined with the floaty movement end up causing you to enter combat far more often than you probably should. I was so annoyed with the new decking mechanics that I simply avoided decking where possible.\n\nI'll reiterate what I said in the opening: I really enjoyed HK. I enjoyed Dragonfall more, and I would point interested players to play that title first, but this is certainly a great game and, despite my gripes, I have no qualms recommending it.","August 25, 2015","true","24.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

THE UI is revamped and the graphics are more polished, yet the same core mechanics as its predecessor.\n\nstory:\n\nas i said, the mystery sucks you right away, and the writing is incredibly sharp, with a lot of description text, great dialogue and various kind of responses to ensure top role-playing experience. i haven't gotten far yet, but i can say the intro wants me to know more, delve deeper into it. the characters are so far really great, useful in combat and have intriguing personality. yet, this is all i can say for now.\n\ngameplay and mechanics:\npretty much the same as before. your skills are governed by stats, you have several classes to pick to (including custom class) and the combat is X-COM enemy unknow-esque turn based combat. nothing stood out too much yet, but really entertaining on its own.\n\ngraphics and music:\n\nlike it's predecessor, this game has 3D character sprites over beautifully, detailed hand drawn 2D background. what i noticed is animation, effects, 3D models and textures are vastly improved over the first 2 games. they are not state of the art level graphics, but quite pleasant to look at. the 2D background resolution is noticeably higher and you can zoom in much further than previous games.\n\nthe music still live up to this game's older siblings. ambient, and atmospheric tunes that fit the grim, cyberpunk dystopia that shadowrun series are set. combined with the graphics, i can say the game provide top-notch atmosphere and immersion.\n\nflaws:\nwith all of that good points, nothing is perfect, and so is this game. i've noticed the revamped UI, especially the skill page is a step down from previous games. the description of stats and skills are put above the clunky looking spreadsheet, and it's kinda sore to look at. so far it's the most galring flaw of this game, but all things considered, i think shadowrun hong kong is a worthy successor of the shadowrun franchise. good job for HBS and their hard work for reviving this unique RPG.\n\nthis review will be updated as i play trough the game further.","August 20, 2015","true","43.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It improves on various aspects of the previous games, including richer graphics and deeper gameplay mechanics (with more varied cyberware, drones and magic as some examples), and well crafted missions. Unfortunately, the overall narrative feels a little weaker than Dragonfall's, and the early versions of the game (as completed on build 3.0.5) contain a lot of minor bugs, that while not game-breaking, can put a damper on the enjoyment.\n\nRegardless: highly recommended for fans of the first two games, and already well worth a consideration for anyone looking for a solidly-written cRPG, especially if you're interested in the Shadowrun setting or cyberpunk in general. For everyone else, maybe wait for a few more bugfixes, the release of the mini-expansion and/or an eventual "Director's Cut".\n\n===\n\nSlightly more in-depth review version:\nI thoroughly enjoyed Shadowrun: Hong Kong, and feel perfectly content with backing HBS's Kickstarter: although (unfortunately) no great leaps forward were made compared to Dragonfall, Hong Kong once again manages to build and improve on various aspects of the previous games.\n\nFirst the good.\n\nSR:HK looks better than before, with more detailed environments, better lighting, and a very cohesive look. It's small improvements all around, but they add up to an aesthetically pleasing package. The visual upgrades to the Matrix also turned out rather nice. Combined with another good soundtrack and decent ambient sounds, Hong Kong may not necessarily feel alive yet, but it certainly has character.\n\nStrong writing and characters were Dragonfall's main claims to fame, and I feel Hong Kong kept to the same standards. Personal preferences may lead one to prefer DF or HK's setting and characters, and while certain characters are stronger than others, the overall writing quality remains high. Gobbet, Racter and Gaichu can compete with the better characters in DF, while Ambrose and Reliable Matthew's stories were just as good or better than most NPCs in Dragonfall. The Shadowlands BBS threads deserve a special mention too: there is some absolute gold in there, well worth the extra reading.\n\nWhen it comes to basic gameplay, Hong Kong does little to change the formula, but again various small improvements add up to a richer experience. More and better cyberware, including cyberweapons, more drones and variants (that actually look different!), more weapons, more spells... They open up a lot more customization and strategic options. I'm looking forward to experimenting with different builds in the future, far more than I did in the previous games.\n\nGameplay-wise, the biggest changes were made to the Matrix, and they are a bit of a mixed bag. I personally enjoyed the changes for the most part: the ability to try to sneak around in the Matrix in real-time, with patrolling Watcher IC with sight cones and hacking Blocker IC to unlock data, is a welcome change from the "slower than meatspace fights until all IC is dead then move on and do the same" from the previous games... but the stealth gameplay itself can be frustratingly clumsy, and the hacking minigame(s) of "simon says" and "find the matching symbols" feel a bit tacked-on (although they look fitting enough).\n\nTo wrap up gameplay, the shadowruns themselves: most of the missions in the game are well-crafted and quite varied, with more options to complete runs (often completely) without resorting to violence.\n\nWhich brings me to what I consider Hong Kong's biggest weakness:\n\nUnfortunately, as much as I enjoyed the missions, writing and characters on their own, the way HK ties it all together isn't quite as good. The overall narrative is just not as strong as it could have been, and the player's influence over the unfolding of the overall story is near-zero. Bad Stuff and Hellish Nightmares are going down, you have missing family members who may or may not be dead... and yet for most of the game there is little sense of urgency. You go around on various unrelated shadowruns, while one of the NPCs disappears to literally move the plot forward on their own once you've completed enough of them. As fun as the individual shadowruns may be, when it feels like they are merely a way to spend time while the game resolves the story for you... it doesn't make the main plotline feel all that relevant, to the characters OR the player. The fact the player character goes from "unexperienced outsider who no one really trusts" to "one of the most notorious shadowrunners around" in the span of a single run, also doesn't help in setting up much of a story arc. All in all, the main plotline is interesting enough, but the pacing and storytelling could have been a lot better.\n\nFinally, there is the issue of bugs, which is perhaps the biggest disappointment. As mentioned in the short version of the review, build 3.0.5 of SR:HK still contains a good number of small bugs. I never encountered any game-breaking bugs myself, and most of the problems like spelling errors, faulty (or overly unclear) item descriptions don't do much to hinder enjoyment of the game. Other bugs lead to unfinished or broken conversation lines however, and another bug lead to one of the main characters (Is0bel) being completely unavailable in the epilogue, keeping me from finishing her storyline altogether. Harebrained Schemes have been rather active in putting out updates, however, so I have good hopes that a few updates from now, most of the frustrating bugs will have been squashed.\n\n\nTo sum it all up: Hong Kong is essentially "more of the same, but (mostly) better". Highly recommended for fans of the first two games, and already well worth a consideration for anyone looking for a solidly-written cRPG, especially if you're interested in the Shadowrun setting or cyberpunk in general. For everyone else, maybe wait for a few more bugfixes, the release of the mini-expansion and/or an eventual "Director's Cut".\n\nIn the meantime, I'll keep looking forward to "more and better"  Shadowrun games in the future.","August 30, 2015","true","53.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is 100% text based. Is it that difficult to translate?\n* The leveling-system for the character looks very boring and feels pretty unfinished. Why did you change the last one?\n* The game itself has not really improved ... I don't expect a game to be totally different to the previous ones ... but a little enhancement would be very nice.\n* Why is the text/dialogsystem on the right side? If I play full hd on my monitor then I have to move my eyes from one side to another to follow the dialog and scenery. I mean ... in any other rpg etc. the dialog is on the bottom and it's fine this way.\n* Text is sometimes to long for a single dialog ... especially if you are in hurry (school or work) and can not save in between.\n* How does the save-system work? I nearly never am able to save the game except I exit it. If this is how it's meant to be ... so why don't just use an autosave-checkpoint-system during whole game?\n* Do I see some propagandistic tries to connect russia with the ukraine? Such stuff does not belong into a game. (The guy living under your room who tells this funny fairytale about the european war.) Or is it this way in the books? This one I am really not sure about.\n\nPOSITIVES:\n* Atmosphere is A+ ... the environment is pretty nice.\n* The characters seem to be worked out very well (not fully finished the game).\n* The story is (till now) very interesting.\n* The hacking stuff for the decker is super ... but I nearly always triggered some of the security drones (maybe too difficult for the strange controls)\n\nThese seems to be some minor topics ... but if you played the other both games then you will see that it somehow sucks that the game seems not to improve. If it stays this way in the future ... I won't buy it.\n\nEDIT:\nI'm not sure about this game ... it looks more like an community MOD or something. I won't say it is bad ... but not worth the full price.\nMaybe I'm just too stupid for this game but why am I not able to upgrade the weapons etc. of my teammates? I was a shaman and bought some ESPs for my decker ... but I was not able to replace the existing ones. Is it supposed to be this way?\n\nIn my opinion this sequel is the worst of all the three ... but not bad. It's okay. I wish there were a little more improvements (like building/equipt the ship - your base - etc. ... making new rooms).\n\nAw yeah ... I figured out that you can not save while any of your characters is moving. And one thing I don't understand:\n* What is the difference between Rewinding and Loading a savegame? I tried both some times and I ended up restarting the whole level ... yeah ... nice ...

It was a fabulous game and I pre-ordered Hong Kong anticipating a similar experience. However, as some others have correctly pointed out -- Hong Kong's balance between interactive reading and actual gameplay is dramatically lopsided to me. I love a good story and the game does well to pull you into its world and characters. However, my karma points, weapons, armor and cyberware feel almost pointless as the last two missions I've accepted -- and completed -- were done without any need for them. Both missions were completed by clicking between endless dialogue windows between characters.\n\nWhile it makes for sometimes intriguing story-telling, it does little to satisfy my interest in video game interactivity. So far, it's been little more than a choose-your-own adventure book with some beautiful static artwork. Even stranger is that for a game that chooses to focus so heavily on written word, there are a remarkable amount of typos, missing words and other seemingly obvious grammatical errors. To me, Dragonfall struck a better balance between story-telling and interactive gameplay than Hong Kong seems to (so far). I will say, I have not finished Hong Kong (I'm 35+ hours in) as I'm finding it a little difficult to do so at this point. However, should I complete it and discover a different result, I will gladly modify my review and recommend it. I will say, if you haven't yet played Dragonfall, you owe it to yourself to do so!","September 7, 2015","false","36.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Even so, it doesn't help that in my opinion, missions pay far too little compared to Dragonfall so getting new gear feels a bit more like pain, some characters also end up going nowhere as their dialogue simply repeats.

Of particular note is the huge number of etiquette/skill dependent dialogue options. These etiquettes were rarely used in Dragonfall, but almost every conversation in HK seems to feature multiple special options.  The Matrix has also been revamped, with gameplay there now allowing you to try and stealth your way through systems - a very welcome change.\n\nThe new crew are well written and engaging - I was skeptical that they could match DF's party, but they've managed superbly. Gobbet is lots of fun, and the brotherly camaraderie with Wu is something you don't often see in RPGs which are usually bogged down in melodrama and brooding.\n\nThe art and design are all lavish, the environments sprawling and a delight to explore (DF might seem rather drab and cramped in retrospect), and missions so far are offering many varied options for completion ranging from fighting, talking, or simply bypassing threats through manipulation of the environment.\n\nThere are one or two bugs - a few conversations which seem to be misfiring, saying you screwed up a run when you didn't (no actual gameplay impact here), but I'm sure these will be ironed out quickly. Beyond that I don't have a bad word to say.\n\nI you've played the previous SRR games you know what you're in for - but this experience is honed and refined almost to perfection (I would appreciate more meatspace stealth, but I believe even that is in this game later on). If you're new to SR this is a fine point to jump into the series. Highly recommended.","August 21, 2015","true","27.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

They updated and improved just about everything from the last game. Graphics are much better, no more hunched over bridge troll or Orc males. Better sound. From the background music to the sound of gun shots far better. They over hauled the cyberwair system for more slots and better synergy between them, giving you FAR more options for your runner. They have customized and expanded the already great magic system, changing spirits and spells, while giving you again more options and synergy from them for you team. The writing pulled me into the story like never before. I find my self reading everything and going out of my way to interact with NPC's. Normaly I just pass them by and skip all the dialoge to get to the action, but I am drawn so far into the story I just can't. All and all, it is by FAR the best game HBS has put out.

It was a fabulous game and I pre-ordered Hong Kong anticipating a similar experience. However, as some others have correctly pointed out -- Hong Kong's balance between interactive reading and actual gameplay is dramatically lopsided to me. I love a good story and the game does well to pull you into its world and characters. However, my karma points, weapons, armor and cyberware feel almost pointless as the last two missions I've accepted -- and completed -- were done without any need for them. Both missions were completed by clicking between endless dialogue windows between characters.\n\nWhile it makes for sometimes intriguing story-telling, it does little to satisfy my interest in video game interactivity. So far, it's been little more than a choose-your-own adventure book with some beautiful static artwork. Even stranger is that for a game that chooses to focus so heavily on written word, there are a remarkable amount of typos, missing words and other seemingly obvious grammatical errors. To me, Dragonfall struck a better balance between story-telling and interactive gameplay than Hong Kong seems to (so far). I will say, I have not finished Hong Kong (I'm 35+ hours in) as I'm finding it a little difficult to do so at this point. However, should I complete it and discover a different result, I will gladly modify my review and recommend it. I will say, if you haven't yet played Dragonfall, you owe it to yourself to do so!","September 7, 2015","false","36.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I wish there was a "meh" option.\n\nThis game was a bit of a disappointment for me after Dragonfall, but a happy reminder that shadowrun is not dead after that abortion of a  MMORPG released earlier using the franchise. The combat mechanics are slightly improved, but the story is...wanting. This game lacked the open world-non-linear feel that the original shadowrun had and that Dragonfall simulated nicely. Going forward I would love a random mission generator and open access to matrix hacking for paydata. All of this being said I will buy a future game, but not sure if I would have spent the time on this one.\n\nThe Good:\n- Great advancment in matrix gameplay mechanics.\n- Retains great battle mechanics from Dragonfall.\n- Graphically on par with its Genre\n- Still love the leveling system, however would like to be able to customize my other shadowrunners.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Dreams. Exposition happens primarily in the heavy handed sense of dreams. Dreams are boring as ♥♥♥♥; you want to loose friends? Tell them your dreams. "So I was walking down this hallway, and I saw this woman" Oooooohhhhhh sweet brah....\n- The story is advanced in a hurried way; I don't find my self caring what happens to anybody in this game. Perhaps I should have talked to NPC's more? But that felt slooooow.\n- Some initial bugs - they have been largly if not entirely ironed out with patches.\n","August 27, 2015","false","102.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","7","15","3","0"

The UI is much cleaner and usable. The addition of free party members with interesting backstories is very welcome - they actually feel like they have personalities and I want to keep them alive and take them on runs with me whenever possible. The story is much more engaging from the start and I really like how you can craft your own backstory through dialogue options with Duncan - your foster brother. The matrix runs are much more interesting and have puzzle, sort of platforming and stealth elements. There is a much bigger diversity of sidequest runs that do not directly impact the main quest, and those for the most part are enjoyable. I also really liked the support for a street monk subclass, I'm definitely going to be playing one the second time through! The final positive note is the music (har har). I love the new soundtrack, it's very moody and often fits the theme of a particular run perfectly - it reminds me of Deus Ex and Vampire: Requiem soundtracks a lot.\n\nOn the negative side there still isn't a great diversity of gear (rifle, better rifle, even better rifle, cyberdeck, better cyberdeck, and so on), there isn't a whole lot of new gear or spells either, although I like the look of some of the new drones. A lot of art assets are recycled (sometimes bizzarely so - what is a Berlin parking booth doing in Hong Kong?), but overall the game looks crisp.\n\nTl;dr If you liked Shadowrun Returns, you will love Shadowrun HK. It is better in every way. If you haven't played Shadowrun Returns, I highly recommend playing Shadowrun HK instead.","August 20, 2015","true","13.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erikb85/recommended/346940/","erikb85","erikb85","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erikb85/","180 products in account","Since SR:R I always vote these games 10/10 even before they come out. Therefore the expectations for SR:HK were high and I can't really say if the following list of mostly disappointments is a valid evaluation of the game. While reading please keep in mind that I rated the previous SR games exremely highly and had, due to the success on Kickstarter, the believe that this would get rid of some of the quirks of the previous game, but instead added some.\n\nMatrix: The best comes first. I was shocked, positiveley, how well you can do the matrix. I really thought what we had in previous games was good enough, given the scenario and the game engine limitations. This is so much more fun. It feels intense. And you really need to apply some skills software developers and hackers need to employ, like recognizing patterns, looking for that one spot that isn't covered by your assertions (or IC) yet, and memorizing seemingly irrelevant details like numbers. There is also real skill involved, because sometimes the spot that is not covered by the watchers is dynamic and you need to move on fast to really not be spotted. The sounds for the number pad at first are really confusing which stopped me from getting more than 4 numbers. But after you get used to them they start to help you and you can sometimes complete the number game, even though it's not really necessary for the pattern game that follows. A huge plus, this whole new matrix thing. I'm so happy I played a decker.\n\nSize: All the SR games are way too short. Maybe because of my expectations this one felt the shortest. The missions are very short, often just contain one little quirk and then you are done with it. You don't have enough character dialogues for all the missions. And how many missions were that, 10? When all the dialogues were finished and I could head out to the final mission there were about 3 or 4 runs left. But I felt like I just warmed up and started. All RPGs are rather boring in the beginning. Only after you develop some of your skills and get some better items you can really start playing. But that's when you were almost finished. Due to the sucess of Kickstarter and co I can't understand that.\n\nStory: It's basically the story from SR:R. Even the endboss looks like a bug. After the runs were finished it got really really boring for me and I just wanted to be done with it. That's the first time this happened in SR to me. Sad.\n\nCharacters: I like to take a Shaman on every run. Because of that and the general dialogues Gobbet was basically the only character I really liked here. If the rest lives or dies, I can't say.\n\nFights: They were also quite boring. In every fight with the end boss I killed in at most 3 rounds. Maybe it's time to play on higher difficulty, I don't know.\n\nEnvironment: Maybe it's because the Shadowrun Pen&Paper designers didn't know about China and HK, but the representation is much worse than with Berlin. Simplified Chinese characters here, wrong characters there. Everything looks like a Chinarestaurant in the US, not like China. Some of the jokes are a copy&paste from the internet, some even are jokes that foreigners make about Chinese not jokes that Chinese people make. I don't know. Getting an HK intern to do your due diligence on the language and cultural stuff is quite cheap. Why do people never do it?\n\nRPG Engine: Can't say, because I only completed my character only about 60% percent. But it seems at least from the items there is not more to get. There was one better uniform to buy than what I had, but there was only one opportunity. Money and Karma wasn't even close to enough to get done with my char.\n\nReplayability: For me, none. The game isn't free enough to try different things. It feels really scripted. You can choose between different paths, but each one of them is layed out clearly in front of you and often has no real impact on the result.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: For me it was not a good game. Just something I finished because I'm a real fan of SR world and the previous games. The new Matrix was top, but nearly everything else was "mamahuhu". I really hope there will be a Dragonfall version with that Matrix though. I can't choose to give no opinion if I recommend it, so I can only give my personal opinion which is: I can't recommend it. Objectively it might be worth it. Can't say.","September 19, 2015","false","54.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

It took me exactly 13.9 hours on focusing on the main story line to finish this game. So it's pretty short. I've not gone out of my way to rush the game so it's definitively on the short side for those who are experienced shadow runners.\n\nI've also got mixed feelings about the innovations, or lack thereof, in SRHK. I understand that on some level the creators want to stay true to the previous versions, and not break much with what is obviously a winning formula. There's nothing wrong with that. But I do feel that there is too little iterative improvement in this version. I mean that while it's ok to leave the game's fundamentals as they are, it's not ok to have them stagnate and age. I would have very much liked to see more quantitative improvements: more spells, more guns, more enemies, more effects, more locations, etc.\n\nNone of these improvements would have impeded or changed the series' main draw and mechanics.\n\nAll in all this is a top notch game in my option.

And I haven't even gotten to the bonus content. I likely never will.\nThe bugs I encounted when I first started playing are still resident and still potentially crippling if not monitored. I'll hash some of those out in a moment. This is my major hang up: As a turn based strategy game, even a game that has a "Rewind" feature; mistakes in skill planning are game breaking. The first instance of this rears it's ugly head in the first real mission "The Walled City". The player character, the NPC Duncan and one other NPC selected from two possibilities are required to run an errand in a Chinese slum. No biggy. However, your choice of that third NPC can have an impact on the Karma (Player Character build points) that you earn durring the mission. One example of this (hacking a computer terminal) requires a piece of equipement that the PC doesn't even have access to that early in the game and bringing the optional NPC that can Hack it means missing another optional objective and reward because you can't bring the other Character. I can earn 2 Karma for muggung a mugger and returning stolen property, but only if Strength AND Unarmed Combat are at certain levels; but if I have those, I won't have either the Magical skills to earn Karma for aiding a Spirit, or the social skills to not completely screw up an encounter with a guard. Great, can I have Duncan beat someone up since I have to drag him along anyway and clobbering people is his specialty? No. Again, my build points are based on characters and situations outside of my control, and that causes a nickle and dime cascade effect that will make the game even more unsalvageable later. The cause of this error is the very "team" mechanic that the game is trying to enforce. The Player Character can't do it all, but the NPC can do considerably less.\nNow take this into account: This is a Turn Based Strategy game. There s a lot of real world time that goes in to just a few moments of game time. Even with the rewind option, it just too much of a time sump to run into a brick wall and have to start even one mission over again. Too bad a complete re-build and replay from start is usually the only real option.\n\nBugs:\nFor no reason that I've noticed, when Characters are moving across the map durring fights, they stop animating and instead, the Sprites just slide around. This only seems to occur when the Sprites are moving from or to tiles that make up paved streets, but it happens randomly and to random characters. Not a serious issue as this is a TBS, but it does show that after all the updates and exxtra content, a core mechanical issue has been completely ignored by the Devs. Character pathing should alway be considered important. If the pathing is glitched, will line if fire, transition points and area events also fail?\nNPC Movement: The NPC Gobbet (a team mate) lags far behind whenever the team moves across region maps. Sometimes, she wont even start moving until the rest of the crew has reached the point they were directed to. Since the game uses Icon transition points on the map, to prevent crashing (it happened to me twice, so far), I have to sit there and wait until the Character finally shows up before having the team move into a new map. Not a game breaker for the patient, but for anyone who doen't notice the discrepency, it could foul up an autosave and thus royally screw over a gamer. Unlikely, but possible.\nThere are many other bugs as well. Some involving sound and music files, some involving inventory. These are all well documented in the Community pages here on Steam. Please, check those out before even considering this game.\nBiggest Bug: The Karma (character Upgrade) Menu. When I click on the in game menu to spend the points I have managed to farm, the Karma submenu takes so damn long to open, that if I don't jiggle the mouse every once in a while, my comp will go into Hibernate. That's bad. And yes, I know that I can change the Hibernate fuctionality on my end, but that isn't the point. The bugs I've listed have been evident since I first DL'd this game last summer and after all this time and all this content, are still here. And though they may seem minor, they all point to some very serious "lurking issues" in the engine that I for one, have no idea how to resolve.\n\nTL;DR\nThis is not a multiplayer game, so why am I being penalized for the inability/availabilty of teammate's skill when I don't have a say in the skillsets of teammates? Why is the ONLY actual character in the game denied advancement because Teammates can't perform thier roles as written? This is a game breaker and it's the failure that has finally warned me off of Harebrained Schemes.","February 14","false","25.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Plot triggers also fail sometimes, and for a game of its visual fidelity it runs really poorly on a mid-range machine. This is extra frustrating when the stealth decking sequences don't allow for tactical movement for some reason, and end up requiring constant reloading to succeed. If you don't have a SSD you're going to have a real slow time.","February 9","false","52.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It's right up there with the previous versions. Top notch writing, the music blending perfectly with the portrayed atmosphere. The game really makes you think about the choices you have your characters making to the point of actually feeling bad for some of the choices you're forced to make.\n\nThe atmosphere is amazing, parts of the game are really terrifying if you keep up with the reading and have the in-game sound on.\n\nIt's not all sunshine and rainbows though. It took me exactly 13.9 hours on focusing on the main story line to finish this game. So it's pretty short. I've not gone out of my way to rush the game so it's definitively on the short side for those who are experienced shadow runners.\n\nI've also got mixed feelings about the innovations, or lack thereof, in SRHK. I understand that on some level the creators want to stay true to the previous versions, and not break much with what is obviously a winning formula. There's nothing wrong with that. But I do feel that there is too little iterative improvement in this version. I mean that while it's ok to leave the game's fundamentals as they are, it's not ok to have them stagnate and age. I would have very much liked to see more quantitative improvements: more spells, more guns, more enemies, more effects, more locations, etc.\n\nNone of these improvements would have impeded or changed the series' main draw and mechanics.\n\nAll in all this is a top notch game in my option.

However, Hong Kong does not deliver and we need to be honest about it. I am not sure what changed in the development of this game, but the final result feels rushed and unfinished.\n\nThe first alarm kicked off as soon as I began reading the text. Namely, right from the start I began noticing errors, missing words and letters, to the point that it seems like nobody bothered to run this through a simple "Word" spell checker. Now, you might be thinking that this is nothing more than nitpicking, but the dialogues in general are horribly written. Most characters in the game seem to talk for no other reason than to make the game feel longer and they bring nothing of value to the table. This comes from a person who loves to read and I am a huge fan of games that do not shy away from text, but the problem with Hong Kong is that the text is just boring and bland. If the quality of the text was on the level of Planescape Torment or even Shadowrun: Dragonfall, I would love this game - but unfortunately it is not!\n\nI mean, when the local blacksmith greets me with 3 pages of text describing how he is sharpening a sword and where he learned the craft, the game is just wasting my time. I have not learned anything of value about that blacksmith, I have not learned anything about his character, I have not received a quest, I have not learned anything about the setting or the story, I have not received a piece of valuable information... it was all just a big waste of my time. And this wouldn't be such a problem if it wasn't a regular occurence for almost every character in the game. After playing Hong Kong for 15 hours, you notice that 70% of the game is just reading these hollow meaningless walls of text.\n\nIt almost feels like there was more content planned, but that the devs ran out of development time. Makes me really sad, because I actually loved the general direction of the story. Hopefully they are planning to release a Director's Cut which will iron out all the bugs, flesh out the characters and rewrite the dialogues so that they actually lead to something. You can't have bad writing if writing is the crux of your game.","November 29, 2015","false","24.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Their successful blend of cyberpunk, corporate espionage, and traditional fantasy elements gives it a lore vastly superior to most games. This game successfully builds on this creating once again an immersive setting which will hook you from the get go.\n\nIt features an epic story line which combines familiar elements from a known world setting to a dystopian future. A crew comprised of well fleshed out party members with their own motivations which sometimes tangle with your own and at other times branch out into over the top side missions. I also must commend the developers of the game on paying attention to details when it comes to your party members who will all have their own specific dialogue and interactions on each different mission. They also can turn out very different depending on your characters interactions with them. That's somewhere that I notice a lot of RPG's cheap out.\n\nYour character has many diverse builds and can rely on hacking and charisma as much as combat prowess and magical ability. The best part remains the customizing of your body through cybernetically enhanced synthetic body parts. Nothing like getting rid of your pathetic normal eyeballs in favor of accuracy enhancing sniper cyborg eyes or getting rid of your soft humanoid skin in favor of a bullet proof carapace.\n\nThe combat is still very similar to Dragonfall and the original which is a good thing. Think X-com with a smaller budget its fast paced turn based tactics make it seem like a superhuman swat team basically going from floor to floor in gang ridden neighborhoods and evil corporate labs. On the downside the AI could use a few tweaks it sometimes does stupid things like go out of it's way to gain cover midway through it's turn when it will ultimately finish it's turn elsewhere, thus wasting valuable actions points. If you're familiar at all with the games I'd recommend playing it on hard to compensate for the AI lacking in the decision making department.\n\nThe new matrix(alternate world when hacking) feels a lot smoother and polished than in the previous iterations. It's more stealth based and differentiates better from regular combat. I'd recommend playing the game as a decker(hacker) because to get the most opportunities and rewards from the game you need a hacker on every single mission yet the hacker that joins your crew is depressingly boring while the rest of your crew are memorable and fun.\n\nAs a final note I'd like to tip my hat to harebrain schemes who basically have resurrected a dead franchise, produced three high quality affordable games from it. Games that always feel fresh and better than the previous one. All that on a crowdfunded budget which is a fraction of what bigger studios who most of the time make uninspired sequels with generic stories who don't interest anyone. 9/10","August 27, 2015","true","90.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

This game successfully builds on this creating once again an immersive setting which will hook you from the get go.\n\nIt features an epic story line which combines familiar elements from a known world setting to a dystopian future. A crew comprised of well fleshed out party members with their own motivations which sometimes tangle with your own and at other times branch out into over the top side missions. I also must commend the developers of the game on paying attention to details when it comes to your party members who will all have their own specific dialogue and interactions on each different mission. They also can turn out very different depending on your characters interactions with them. That's somewhere that I notice a lot of RPG's cheap out.\n\nYour character has many diverse builds and can rely on hacking and charisma as much as combat prowess and magical ability. The best part remains the customizing of your body through cybernetically enhanced synthetic body parts. Nothing like getting rid of your pathetic normal eyeballs in favor of accuracy enhancing sniper cyborg eyes or getting rid of your soft humanoid skin in favor of a bullet proof carapace.\n\nThe combat is still very similar to Dragonfall and the original which is a good thing. Think X-com with a smaller budget its fast paced turn based tactics make it seem like a superhuman swat team basically going from floor to floor in gang ridden neighborhoods and evil corporate labs. On the downside the AI could use a few tweaks it sometimes does stupid things like go out of it's way to gain cover midway through it's turn when it will ultimately finish it's turn elsewhere, thus wasting valuable actions points. If you're familiar at all with the games I'd recommend playing it on hard to compensate for the AI lacking in the decision making department.\n\nThe new matrix(alternate world when hacking) feels a lot smoother and polished than in the previous iterations. It's more stealth based and differentiates better from regular combat. I'd recommend playing the game as a decker(hacker) because to get the most opportunities and rewards from the game you need a hacker on every single mission yet the hacker that joins your crew is depressingly boring while the rest of your crew are memorable and fun.\n\nAs a final note I'd like to tip my hat to harebrain schemes who basically have resurrected a dead franchise, produced three high quality affordable games from it. Games that always feel fresh and better than the previous one. All that on a crowdfunded budget which is a fraction of what bigger studios who most of the time make uninspired sequels with generic stories who don't interest anyone. 9/10","August 27, 2015","true","90.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Shadowland BBS is a ♥♥♥♥ing delight. Atmosphere and designs of locations are gorgeous.\n> Runs are actually interesting stories on their own. Didn't find any run boring throughout the game.\n> Varying options for your PC, you can build them any which way that fits your playstyle.\n\nCons\n> Point and click mildly frustrating, because 'No Duncan I didn't want you to go beside the enemy and expose yourself in the open for the love of god I wanted you to shoot at him.'\n> Text heavy. Although some lore is fun to read, some convos just drag on a lot. A few formatting and grammar errors here and there.\n> Story pacing is off. Basically goes PLOT START - side missions - PLOT END.\n> Loading screens rather long, framerate goes a bit weird when exploring the map.\n\nOverall, an absolute delight. 4/5","January 31","true","82.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you've played the previous two games, you'll know what to expect - extremely good writing, nice RPG system, fun quests, the usual. The only thing that's different, and something I seriously hate is THE BULL**** NEW DECKING SYSTEM. Really, it's possibly one of the most unneccessary and unintuitive changes I've ever seen in a game series. All it encourages is a lot of time save scumming and restarting from a save point in the matrix because of how bull the controls are in comparison to how punishing and time consuming it is to get caught in the matrix. Same goes for hacking itself, it's a real pain in the ♥♥♥. It's to the point where I'd reccomend NOT making a decker and avoiding any decking sequences when possible, if only to save yourself rage and time. Other than that, I liked that etiquettes are all actually useful in this game, although gang and security are used much more heavily as far as I've gotten. In addition, rewards are much stingier compared to the last two games, something I enjoyed as it really forces you to play smart. Combat isn't too difficult, as per usual. All in all, a good game, albeit severely hampered by that god awful, awful decking change.\n7/10\nPS: there's mods that revert the decking to the old format - I'd highly reccomend you pick them up.","February 6","true","21.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Really, really loved it. And you can pretty much say that I agree 90% with most of the positive reviews of this game. However, I'm not finishing this game for a big reason.\n\nThe whole weird stuff keeps happening issue. In Dragonfall, the game occasionally buckled under the strain of the designers' wishes. Too many enemies and the occasional complicated environment led to long loading times, awkward enemy behavior, and the enemies taking very long turns "thinking". This game takes the same engine and goes crazy-go-nuts. Two or three times as many enemies, large maps, vendors on combat maps, complicated mechanics, and teams of helpful NPCs make the game go really weird.\n\nI've had the game repeatedly take a long time "thinking" about turns for enemies I had not aggroed, so the long turns just resulted in them taking no action. I've had friendly NPCs block exit doors and I had to trick them into fighting enemies so I could get past them. I've had both enemies and friendly NPCs take weird turns where they just kind of wander around the map. It seems like whenever enemies summon a spirit, it inevitably starts wrecking them and they don't fight back against it (yay!). I've had really weird item management when vendors are present on combat/mission maps.\n\nOverall, it's like someone decided to take their stock Toyota Camry to the race track; the game just doesn't do what the designers wished it would. The weird stuff makes a game that kind of isn't as good as the last game really lose whatever luster it still had.","April 19","false","13.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The devs learned a great deal from their first run in this world, and it shows.\n\nFirst off, the combat of the game has changed very little from the previous Shadowrun. It didn't need to. It already provided what it needed and was robust enough, if breakable.\n\nWhere this game truly shines is the decisions you make, and the story you participate in. It. Is. INCREDIBLE. Unlike the original, you are not railroaded into combat and over-arching decisions. I am currently playing as a charismatic shaman with an acedmic and scholarly backgrounds, with the intent of smooth-talking through most of my problems. And I can!! And I've seen many options that other builds could explore but I could not, BUT! I've done 4 missions so far, and I've really only had 1-2 fights outside of the tutorial start. I've been able to bluff, lie, negotiate and silver-tongue my way to victory almost every time!\n\nAnd the depth of the characters is just INCREDIBLE. I actually timed myself and I will spend an hour just running around talking to people. Everyone's got a story, everyone's got a background, and they all convey it in their own way. It is just obscenely great.\n\nI can't comment on the Hong Kong in the game too much, because I know I'm only scratching the surface right now. Hopefully someone will remind me 300 hours in to finish up this review.\n\nGet this game and enjoy it. ;)","August 26, 2015","true","27.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Taken by itself this is a decent RPG implemented within a buggy piece of software.  The writing is decent, in fact it is better than the writing in the previous two games.  The problem is that these games have become formuliac.  The underlying system hasn't changed that much since the first game with the exception of the Matrix.  It nearly took me the entire game to come to terms with the new Matrix implementation.  Sadly there was no tutorial on how to do things in the new Matrix which I consider to be a real missed opportunity.\n\nAnyway if you liked the previous two games and you think you'd like more of that, then pick this one up.  I thought I wanted more too.  But now that I'm done, I realize that I really didn't want more.  I wanted something a bit more interesting and less predictable than what Harebrained Schemes had previously given us.  Sadly this is not that game.

The entire game is suffering from some weird memory leak that affects your gameplay and loading / saving times the more you play. The cursor / interaction marker is really weird. It either disappears and reappears a few moments later or it won't trigger the interactive item until you've clicked a few times. It's even worse than in Dragonfall which had a few minor issues with the cursor / interaction.\n\nLot of things in the game don't really make any sense. In one mission you can interact with a bookcase and with the proper main stats, you might spot secret things in it, but - here be spoilers:  With intelligence 3 you can search the books and the bookcase and try to find something out of the ordinary - which you don't. However, if you "search" the same bookcase with strength 5 you find a hidden door or wall of some sort which you can barge through. Clearly, with a higher intelligence you should've been able to spot a button or a lever or a switch that would open said hidden door/wall, yes? You don't. It makes no sense.\n\nElf character with high Charisma rules all, once again. There's really no other reason to pick any other race.\n\nYour companions are incredibly boring. They are just bland. There's no 'soul' to them. Out of all the companions you can have, only one is well fleshed out and interesting.\n\nThere is something really weird going on with hit chances. I've had several misses at 100% hit chance. Either the tooltip is wrong or the game calculates actual hit chance way differently than it's displaying.\n\nSeveral areas of the game suffer from extreme memory leaks, bogging down and becoming sluggish. Certain rooms will also trap you in them, forcing you to cheat your way out of it via the console because you just can't leave even if the door is wide open. Prosperity Tower, I'm looking at you!\n\nThe amount of money you get from missions is appallingly low compared to how much upgrades and supplies cost.\n\nThe game is just ... bland! Everything that made Shadowrun: Dragonfall great seems to have been forgotten in this third iteration. While Shadowrun: Hong Kong is aesthetically pleasing, it's just about all it is.\n\nAs an old Pen and Paper RPG'er who ran Shadowrun like crazy back in the day, I cannot in good faith recommend this game. Until it either gets a massive overhaul to eliminate the bugs and memory leaks or is on sale, I would stay away from it.\n","August 25, 2015","false","34.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

I have to say that my overall impression is...meh.  All of the shadowrun games that have come up under this company follow the same format regarding graphics and gameplay, with the except of now in the matrix you have to try to dodge roaming sentries and hack through friewalls using patter recognition skills...a "repeat numbers sequence" followed by matching up a string of ascii-like symbols that are randomply shown to you - both which, i fell, are antithema to an RPG such as this.\n\nI label this game as "Less of the same."  It's the same core game as all the others, but the story just seems so much more less.  There are no real twists in the plot, which is rather straight forward, and the sidequests of playing out the other NPC's storylines have no effect on the plot, at all.  Unlike in the last game, there just really isn't anything there.  The ending of this game just left me feeling rather...empty.  There was no real conclusion, or even a desire to try to replay the game, as there was no hint that major choices in the game would really have an effect on the final ending story of your character.\n\nIt would be worth a playthrough if this game is on sale, but I won't bother buying it at full price.

I must admit however, that even though I really enjoyed Dragonfall (playing through it twice - upon original release and later the directors cut) Shadowrun Hong Kong just didn't click for me. It might be that I am simply tired with the same formula and engine, or that recent excellent and more ambitious RPG like Pillars of Eternity & Wasteland 2 make me want a more complex game.\n\nThe good stuff - there are many tweaks to the game which are welcome. The UI is much better this time around. You can also enter turn based combat mode at will, so if you spot an enemy you can set up and get a drop on them. There is also the new decking system however it does not bring changes I hope for. It would be nice if decking allowed player to interact with enviroment in some interesting way, but all it changed is the way Matrix works on the inside. It plays a bit like a stealth game but it is very basic and not very fun.\n\nThe story is weaker than in DF. You end up chasing after a person you never met ingame, which makes it very difficult to care about him. It doesn't help that writing isn't as tight. There are interesting ideas and missions, some cool characters but most of the conversations go for too long after they finish. It seems the script could use a rewrite of two. So does the whole game for that matter. Some conversation in the game (the hub area) kept repeating everytime I talked to that person and I don't think it was supposed to happen. Nothing game breaking but certainly felt "unfinished."\n\nAlso, just like in the Shadowrun Returns, I found that many of my skills and my etiquete weren't really usefull throughout the game. DF improved on it making frequent use of different skills and background giving you an impression that who you are matters. Here the design seems sloppy again.","September 16, 2015","false","30.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Very disappointing. I've played about nine missions and eight of them were bugged. I only got through the first three missions before several missions were made in-completable due to buggy programming and the game made unplayable. These were fixed in the first patch but, but considering these early missions were so badly broken, they should have been fixed before release. On several occasions the character tabs for all but one team member disappeared from the UI during combat. The matrix looks better but the new mechanics are ridiculous. For instance you can buy a program to reduce alert status but it takes several rounds to use again and, unlike every other program in your kit, doesn't reset once matrix combat has finished. The next matrix combat can start several minutes later and you've still got seven rounds before you can use this programme to reduce your threat level. Your matrix avatar glides, as opposed to walking at the same pace as your non-matrix character in the first two games, at such a slow pace defence programs can over take it initiating raised alert status and combat, and clicking on some points of the flooring can be faulty producing no movement whatsoever. Some of the mission and level design is poor. All I've done for three nights since it's release is consistently swear at my computer and have hot showers to release endorphins in order to cool down. Younger gamers might accept this situation, but after forty years of being a gamer a brand spanking new release in a series by a respected production house shouldn't have this many problems at the time of it's release. Again, considering how good Shadowrun and Shadowrun Dragonfall were, very disappointing. I'm hoping several more patches will rectify many of the problems I have with SHK.

But I can't say that now. I can't force myself to play it anymore, so I can't even finish the damn game. So be aware.\n\nDisclosure: I backed both kickstarter campaigns. I played the first one three times in a row, which is unprecedented for me. Maybe because I prefer RPGs and most of them are 50-100 hours long, so even after three playthroughs I still had time to spare. So I liked Shadowrun Returns very much. The Dragonfall not so much, although I still enjoyed it and got through the campaign.\n\nSo what's different now? Well there are few changes in GUI (some I do like, some not so much, but that's not important) and there are some game-play changes as well. The Matrix now works differently, it's more stealth oriented. The game doesn't tell you anything about the changes and it took me three attempts at hacking minigame to find out that there are actually some characters which should help you break the code. The lack of introduction was grin-worthy, but not a mayor fault.\n\nYou level up your runners now, after every run you give them one of two skills. And you can give them some equipment. Bud I was so poor that I could barely buy new weapon for myself, so I don't know what's up with that.\n\nGenerally, I really like the writing in these new Shadowrun games. Hong Kong is no different, in the way they are written. The problem is the content. Most of the times the reasoning of the characters, why they are doing said things, is just stupid. I've never noticed that before in these games, but this time it was a big problem for me. That said, there were occasions where I really enjoyed the dialogues and I had to think about stuff afterwards.\n\nIn the SR Returns, the controls were unresponsive at times till they fixed it. Dragonfall did not have this problem. Here comes Hong Kong and the unresponsiveness is back.\n\nFor the more serious problems: they are building on the thing that I didn't like in the Dragonfall. In SR Returns all of the shop keepers were in your hideout. So if you wanted to buy something, you just run around for few seconds and you had everything. In Dragonfall they spread it out to a whole city block. For someone like me who has to constantly check if there is something new, better, it was mayor boring waste of time and really bad design. I get that they wanted to put some stories into it, but for me the positives didn't out-weight the negatives. Here, it's the same.\n\nThe biggest problem for be is the combat. They added armor indicators and different kinds of cover. Which sounds nice, until you see it in action. The combat is really long, and boring. I was inflicting small amounts of damage to character out of cover. I had a long fight with enemies which were mostly unarmed, they were running around like crazy, and hitting me harder with fists that I did with weapons. I don't know how else to say it, but I couldn't enjoy combat when I saw what a little damage I was inflicting, waiting minutes and minutes for the boring fight to end.\n\nI really like the SR formula, but I think that the evolution of a combat is a bad one. They should make a bigger game, with free roaming, exploration, better item progression and faster combat. I loved the combat in the first game, all the possibilities and combinations. The only problem was that there wasn't enough of it. And now? Now I hated it.\n\nI really don't like to do this, I really really don't, but I can't recommend this game :(","September 16, 2015","false","11.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

The quality of the story is great. The shadowrun missions are engaging. If you like all of what I said, buy the game. HOWEVER, I will warn you. There are some bugs here and there, but that isn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem is the size of the game. It's an amazing game that is SHORT. Hear me out, now. If there was a large community where people made their own storylines often, I would be playing this game everyday. (Tis true) Unfortunately, the community is not large and the "amazing main storyline" is short. What does that provide us?

I am sad because I don't get to play more of this beautiful game.\n\nConclusion/TL;DR: This game is amazing and you should buy it if you want to support the developers. Otherwise, don't buy it. It's a very short experience and I don't see anything new expansions coming anytime soon.\n\nTherefore, I don't recommend this game in a general sense.","September 13, 2015","false","16.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Then leave and collect your "reward".\n* And yeah, they changed the Matrix, like many reviewers have been pointing out. While a bit repetative, I find the new Matrix in itself rather good. Unfortunately this game hardly has no battles in the real world. You just jack in, battle the security system and jack out.

The strategic element of this degenerates things even further.  I should not call it strategy...I should call it economic management.  You have 2 choices: 1) Specialize to the hilt and only partly play a role in your party or 2) Be so inept that you have to rely completely on your party.  Your fellow shadowrunners are far more powerful than you are so you are basically the face of your group rather than being a part of it.\n\nThe reason you must specialize is not the reason you might think either.  Most of the time it is because of Karma...not so this time.  This time there are 2 factors.  The first and biggest reason is money...there is just not enough for you to load out your character with better gear to make use of the skills you have if you try to split specialities.  Even as a specialist if you make a mistake choosing gear it could take you 2-3 runs just to correct that mistake.  The second is the badly scaled missions.  You are offered missions...but who knows if you are actually god enough to do them.  You either have an easy time of it or get your face ripped off and find yourself respecing and redoing content.  This is a save fest game.\n\nThe story is fragmented and does not really flow like the previous two.  It is open ended but so much so that you really don't have a focal point.  You are constantly pushed away from your RPG plot goal by NPCs who are dismissive and disgruntled.  Lots and lots of text to red through...a lot of which has nothing to with the main story or any missions, as well as plot lines that go nowhere.\n\nVerdict: Buy on sale.  I am glad I did not kickstart this.  I think HBS should stick to the story telling and let somoene else deal with the rest of the games design.","August 27, 2015","false","80.2"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","4","13","0","0"

Like many have said this game is overly texty especially in the beginning, and you're forced to shift through tons of text that has little impact on the game(I'm all for details but not forced on the player the way this game does it).\n\nI also wasn't huge on the improvements to the Matrix(The hacking mini game inside the hacking mini game is just annoying) and the karma interface(It was nice being able to see everything at once). Overall some of the tweaks were nice(the new chain shot spell is awesome), but I wish they had spent more time making inventory management less of a chore). Also, the attempt as stealth does't really work and sometimes when you enter combat you'll find half your team nowhere close to you which makes the movement extremely frustrating.\n\nHowever, some of the missions were pretty good, the music is top notch, They hit the nail on the head with the improved cyberware system, and at one point I had a vampire and ghoul on my team biting demons to death which was quite enjoyable.\n\nOverall I was disappointed, Dragonfall was a great evolution from Returns but this one is just kinda trading water. On the bright side I'm sure some people will make some awesome stuff with the creator, but Dragonfall already has TONS of good content with a better campaign.","August 24, 2015","false","42.4"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","10","1","10","0","0"

It is a completely different beast than Dead Man's Switch (i.e. Shadowrun Returns) or Dragonfall, which I both loved. When making this game HBS took one step forward and three steps back. Even the "new and improved" Matrix is hardly an improvement - they didn't make it anymore challenging, they just made it somewhat annoying.\n\nThis is by far the worst Shadowrun game that HBS has made. I am quite disappointed. :/\n\nOriginal Post:\nIt's like Dragonfall but with a higher production value, HBS improved upon almost everything.\n\nGreat writing, great character design, great combat.

And if you don't avoid being detected or fail to do the minigames (deliberate or because you made to much errors) you are forced into fighting thru the matrix, but on a much more unfair way the old system worked. Most of the time the enemies spawn right next to you so you have no chance to avoid damage as it is possible in the normal turn based fights where the positioning of enemies isn't that unfair.\n\nIt's so ♥♥♥♥ing stressing and doesn't fit a game that lives from a good written story and reading lot of text and turn based combat from time to time.\n\nThe way the game is now it tends to make me mad instead of grant me some nice time of good roleplay experience.

I can't see much of the magic overhaul that was promised beforehand, and the changes in the Matrix simply make the game boring and tedious instead of adding more flair. The campaign is a lot less intricate and addictive than Seattle or Berlin. I miss the tiny tidbits of information being hidden in interesting background stories. The odd sidequest within a level. The odd extra loot you could get for being familiar with some obscure etiquette.\nWhether I'd recommend the game: sure. For if you like Shadowrun this series is your only option. However, if you're new to the world and new to this series: start with the two other campaigns. They're much more fun. Less bugs. And cheaper, too.\n\nEDIT: having restarted a third time to get past the buggy Misdirection run (and having encountered the same fatal bug yet again) this is all I can say: wait until this game gets a bug overhaul and is preferably on a 90% sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timshel66/recommended/346940/","timshel66","Mike (who are you running from?)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timshel66/","125 products in account","The great thing about a having a sequel that reuses an easily customizable RPG engine is that the developers can concentrate entirely on writing and quest content, which are generally the strongest parts of the genre. I've played Shadowrun Returns before this and it's easy to see how immersion and character building has greatly improved thanks to this increased focus on storytelling.\n\nEach of your main companions have interesting and varied backgrounds, can have detailed conversations with you after every mission you take, and eventually grow as individuals as the story progresses. My favorite is Racter- a reserved, pragmatic rigger who can be pressed into revealing having such extremist views on the future of humanity that he could have easily filled in as a sympathetic supervillain in another game. Seeing my relationships with these characters grow and learning about their history was one of the biggest draws for me to keep progressing. Ironically, you also have the option to ignore these character stories entirely and focus entirely on missions- don't do this or you will miss a great deal of the game's content! This is a game for slow enjoyment, not rushing around mowing down enemies as quickly as possible.\n\nHowever, people who do like Shadowrun's mishmash of magic and gunplay will find plenty to enjoy here. Gone are the long, grueling combat gauntlets and gimmicky boss fights of Shadowrun Returns, mainly replaced by short but intense firefights centered around interesting environmental pieces. The vast majority of combat in the game can be entirely avoided, and since your companions are more than capable of standing up to enemies at any point in the game you can feel free to upgrade your main character entirely into diplomatic/non-combat skills if you so choose. Or if you want to effortlessly kill everyone, be an Elf and invest all your Karma points into Quickness and Ranged Weapons. Seriously, no amount of reality warping magic and techological wizardry can match an ungodly accurate guy with an assault rifle.\n\nI really liked all the creative ways the player can infiltrate corporations and trick NPCs during quests. However I think the game drops the ball a bit here by making combat much easier than it ever was in Returns or most other RPGs. Enemies tend to rarely be much of a threat except in huge numbers, and you generally can get away with mindlessly charging an enemy's defensive position instead of trying to intelligently make use of the environment. Compare this to a game like Wasteland 2 where trying to rush down a sniper will get your characters killed in a hurry. Sure, this isn't supposed to be a combat focused game, but it takes out a lot of the reward in trying to outsmart and avoid a group of guards when I can easily just mow them down without any consequence.\n\nOverall this is a fun RPG with great quests and characters that suffers from being way too easy in terms of combat and a lack of replayability. If you're the type of player who enjoys reading a lot of dialogue and finding creative solutions to quests you will probably enjoy this game quite a bit.","August 23, 2015","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a fan of the lore and don't hate cRPGs, then this is money well spent. If you liked the first two games, then this is money well spent.\nAfter my first playthrough I can say, that the game entertained me greatly all the way through, even though the story was kind of predictable after some point. Nonetheless engaging and the writing is excellent. So overall I love most about everything about this game, but there are some minor nitpicks.\nPlease bear in mind that I played on hard, if you're playing it on a lower difficulty your experience may vary.\n\nThe MatrixThe matrix got an overhaul. Even though I was one of the few that liked the matrix in the old games, I still think this is an improvement. However, there are some things that might put people off. Note that I have not yet played a PC decker, the experience may therefore vary.\nMovement in stealth sections is way to imprecise\nisometric view can obscure important details in stealth sections.\nNo access to programs in stealth sections.\nNo possibility to get into combat-mode without getting caught first.\nThe Blocker-IC minigame can become kind of irritating after a while.\nIs0bels matrix accuracy is way to low...\nThe DifficultyIt is way to easy. I played on hard and finished the game as a Face (max. Charisma, all etiquettes) with some cyberware and some rifle-skill in about 27 hours. There wer only very few parts of the game where I felt actually challenged. And I am someone who seldom finnishes a game, even less so on the hardest possibility. The most bothersome thing was the grenade-love of NPCs, and you can get past that quite easily with a nice little cyberarm. The only thing, that was remotely challenging was the matrix and that is most likely only because I had to use Is0bel, who is only okay at matrix combat.\nI have now started another playthrough, where I changed to normal difficulty, just to check things out and because I wanted to build an even less optimized character (burn-out adept-cyberweapon-shaman-grenade girl). It is ridiculously easy...\n\nThe Loading TimeLoading times are long. Really long, and tehy got progressively worse. I had up to 30 seconds of black space before a loading screen even appeared. And when you're reloading your quicksave over and over again, because Is0bel screwed up in the matrix, but you want to get it just perfect, then you're going to wait. A lot. I think I can attribute at least one hour of my playtime, only to loading screens.\n\nThe Small StuffOne nitpick of mine is the fact, that when you start up a drone, the controlls automatically switch to the drone. I can't even remember how often I have tried to relocate Racter after activating Koshei and relocating Koshei instead. But that was also the problem in the previous games, so that's old news.\n\nThe Good StuffWell, I already said, that I actually love most all of this game, but there are some things that stand out.\nThe writing. It's good. It's real good. At least on the same level as in Dragonfall. I can't really decide which one I like more.\nThe ability to engage combat-mode before the enemy sees you. Glorious, wouldn't want to miss that anymore.\nThe stealthy matrix. It might have problems in the execution, but the overall feel is just right.","August 23, 2015","true","40.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's more of the same, but slightly different.  I'll come out right away and say that it isn't better than Dragonfall but its better than Returns. I've had so alot of fun playing this, and i'm on the last mission now. There is one thing though, that they havent fixed, and which has been a problem in all the games: Decking(hacking) ♥♥♥♥ing SUCKS. This minigame is acceptable at best, when out of combat, but when in combat, it just becomes a huge annoyance. Escepecially when theres a timer on it (which there always is for some reason). It's so god damn boring. at least is this installment they've sped things a bit up, but it doesn't help. You're still slowing the gameplay down, while you're waiting for your Decker to finish casting magic hacking magic at boring and useless enemies, while avoiding to trip the alarms, to summon more useless and boring enemies. And when you're done killing boring and useless enemies you're rewarded with a boring and frustrating minigame. It requires you to concentrate, and you're so bored that you lose your concentration and then you lose your will to live. My plea is that, unless they come up with something AMAZING that rivals the rest of the gamepay, they should cut hacking entirely, accept the loss and make it a "dialogue" skill only.\n\nTheres also some small bugs. Like chosing to kill a character in one mission, and yet he's on your team on the next. Very weird.","August 27, 2015","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the revamping of the Matrix system and the adding of the Cyberware affinity tree- you can make any Shadowrunner you can think of. I have been playing an Adept/mage Elf with some cool Cyberware, and I'm having a blast (I even have a spur on my right cyberarm for when chummers try to get close, of course if my katana doesn't get em' first). Being an adept, I hit crazy hard with my katana or spur... and if the chummers like to try and bug out- I have a few spells to light em up! Combat is turn-based like most cRPGs, with Shadowrun's awesome magic & sci fi lore. Role a decker and hack the greedy corps- or hack some chummer who has too much cyberware and not enough brains. Role a street samurai and slice up some chummers & gun em down if they try to run. This is one game every Shadowrun fan needs in their library.

Don't get me wrong, i still like the game and if you're familliar with its predecessors and enjoyed them, then you'll like this game too - but maybe with the same sense of 'if only' that i have after wading through it.\n\nFinally, the game mechanics run smoothly with no gaping omissions or unfinished corners (though I found the new matrix 'run & dodge' more irritating than fun). The art is pleasing but the text side of the game (not necessarily the story itself) is like some socially inept bore at a party who pins you to the wall with tedious rhetoric only he finds interesting and has no comprehension of actual conversation. There's so much useless text in this game that my eyes glazed over far too quickly, and i generally like text heavy games. For mood, theme and function (and it was the lack of the last that was particularly notable) presented in text, Baldur's Gate or Planescape Torment this is not. Hong Kong's predecessors were tight and slick in their text use and storytelling while Hong Kong just isn't, it becomes a laborious 'click through' that swamps the better features of what could have been the best iteration of Shadowrun by Harebrained yet.\n\nUltimately, its the editing of the game that is flawed, not the game itself. What a shame. Still, at least it /has/ a good plot and two dimensional characters in gaming are always better than the conventional one. I also think that this game will be much more palatable on a tablet rather than hunched in front of a desktop. Something i think proved true of the other two games too, so maybe wait for that...

IMHO it's an important call:\nI don't see the 1.2 million USD happen in the game (kickstarter money, so it's on top of copies sold). So... either kicstarters were ripped off, or, in the name of presumption of innocence, either much more content will be coming soon or the saga will go on, but without kickstarting the new episodes.\nHarebrained hopefully won't turn into a money raking "something" and don't let people down who gave them their money to make Shadowrun series happen... We'll see...\n2. Not enough money\nI played this time a Shaman and I have to tell, it's far too easy to run out of nuyens. I assume the same applies to the rest of the classes. I was able to buy 2-3 spells throughout the whole game (done all side quests), on top of that, 2x better armor and grenades & 1st aid only. No cyber, new gun or anything. Could be it's my fault on some level but looking at the numbers (nuyens/mission) it's not.\n\nPROS\nThe list is endless, so I'm trying to be brief (and by that, somewhat inaccurate so don't come down hard on me ;)\n1. The game is story rich and built up nicely (real GM wrote it?) as in previous SRs, which is very, very cool!\n2. Many more NPCs and their stories and comments are nice readings\n3. Lovely wording and lots of funny conversations is a huge plus\n4. New matrix is nice, but as I mentioned, would prefer in upcoming SRs a clever mix of old&new\n5. Combat system is the same. Simple enough, fun to fight, have to do tactics\n6. It's a must to have a balanced party (I think it's a plus and I find it important)\n7. The game is stable and reliable (13.5hrs in one row without quitting - no issues at all)\n8. For those who care, GFX got better. Music is fine (not astonishing or very impressive, also not very 'authentic' but it's fine)\n\nLast but not least, with average reading speed (as a non-native), doing all side-quests and pretty much reading everything and talking to everyone, it took 28 hours to play the game through (which is fair for the price, but I'm also planning to play through again with a different class, or maybe pull out Dragonfall, so at the end of the day, it's more bang for the bucks).\n\n\nAlltogether even though text really can be a little too much and money really is a huge minus, the game is fun and HIGHLY recommended.

As I haven’t played the table-top / P&P Shadowrun, I can only speak to the game itself. (TL;DR: Skip to last sentence)\n\nThe Shadowrun Returns series have brought me back to enjoying overhead sprite based games. Since the early Fallout games, I’ve never found RPGs with this style to be particularly engaging.\nAs the latest iteration of the Shadowrun Returns games, Hong Kong provides a lot of polish and features that were missing while improving upon the foundation that was already pruned from the previous two games. This is not to say it is perfect, but I’ll touch on that in a bit.\n\nThe characters you run with are quite interesting. I’d say that they kept a lot of the improvements from Returns to Dragonfall in this new game. How do these characters compete with Dragonfall’s? The conclusion I come to here is that your perception of this depends upon your personality. I’d say it was an improvement (especially since there are more character to get to know), but perhaps some may find them slightly less engaging than before.\n\nNew skills have been added that, I felt, increased the immersion. They allowed for greater specialization and seem to level the field for greater viability between classes. On that note, cyberware as a whole has seen a massive facelift which made me very excited.\n\nThe matrix has been revamped and personally, I love it. I have heard the complaints concerning the difficulty of some tasks within the matrix, but I found the difficulty refreshing and overcoming it equally satisfying. It is worth mentioning that it doesn’t seem to be common knowledge that you can skip pieces of these puzzles by hitting the “next” button. While it increases the challenge of the following section, I usually found that final section easier than the rest of the “memory test” combined.\n\nThe story and atmosphere are, once again, to die for. For me, this is the real appeal of these games and Hong Kong is absolutely no exception. If magic seems a stretch in a cyberpunk universe, I promise, these games make it feel right at home in the dark, seedy, grimy world of dystopian cyberpunk. Further, I would strongly assert that the addition of magic adds significantly to the universe. Its addition makes the universe feel that much more uncontrollable (yet very tightly controlled), dark, and dangerous.\n\nI won’t try to tell you that the game is flawless. There are certainly bugs and problems--I haven’t experienced nearly as many as some and I beat the game before the first major patch was announced so I don’t believe they are as prolific as some claim--but many of these have been patched out.\n*Edit: On my second playthrough, I have noticed quite a few more bugs. Most of them have no effect on gameplay.\n\nThe biggest complaint I can offer you (which is a meagre gripe in comparison to the game’s merits) is that it is text based instead of being voice acted. For its predecessors, I didn’t see this as a flaw in the slightest because the dialogue was either minimal or very engaging. In this game, while the dialogue retains its very interesting dialogue, there is simply so much of it that I sometimes found it difficult to want to speak to many of the NPCs and simply gave priority to the ones who I found interesting. As a counter to my own complain though, I do like that I didn’t spend all my time talking to every single NPC in the small little village of a home as that felt closer to real life. So, ultimately, I’m conflicted on the matter.\n*Edit: Aside from this, the loading times are quite sad. I moved the game from my secondary hard-drive to my SSDs and it's still an issue. This is really the only thing about the game that I find unnacceptable.\n\nIn the end, I can say this: if you liked the original Fallout games, if you like cyberpunk themed stories or games, or if you like RPGs, you really ought to pick these games up. I’d be a bit surprised if you didn’t enjoy them.","August 22, 2015","true","80.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buggy at times, SR:HK recreates the tabletop experience with a plot that loses coherence and drive somewhere in the middle before whipping everything back together for the finale like an actual game master would have happen - complete with a literal deus ex machina as an end boss.\n\nThe maps are much larger, but most of it is empty space populated with nice atmospheric setpieces.  Nice scenery does kind of wear thin after a while when you're criss-crossing the hub area to buy things or advance the little subplots the NPCs have.\n\nThe new Matrix gameplay emphasizes sneaking around and playing Simon/a memory game.  It was novel, but wore that novelty out quickly.\n\nDespite it all, would still recommend the game if only for one run through.  The story is nice and all the little details and in-jokes are appreciated.  Replayability is something I'm on the fence about - there's parts of this game's combat and Matrix mechanics that are simply a slog and the different avenues of conversation/story really just determine how much of a jerk you are to random people in Hong Kong/your team exemplified best in the end-of-game dialogue with the end boss.  In short, replayability doesn't look good to me on the effort/payoff scale.\n\nAlso kind of salty that there's a Hong Kong game and you can't dual-wield pistols I mean seriously now this is a terrible oversight.","August 23, 2015","true","41.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No longer do you have to just smash and grab your way to victory. A lot more Matrix action intertwined with regular charming through, or if you butched it an all out firefight with heavily armed security, while the clock is ticking. Manipulation of people and hardware to gain accsess to areas you are not supposed to be in and in the final act s*t hits the fan and you know what they say? Once s*it hits the fan, no one comes out clean. Those final missions felt like shadowrun, looked like shadowrun and quite franquly were what I was missing in the rest of the game. I will stick to my former statement, that the game has huge issues, is (at the moment) buggy to no end and lacks a proper pacing / story telling untill you reach the final chapter, but I will say that fans of the universe will love what is coming after they fought their way through the early / mid game.\nIt makes me wonder if those other runs where only implemented to get the game to a proper length, they sure feel like they were lacking love and attention (with some exceptions.)\n\nNow that I have seen the end, which will take a "casual" gamer about 1, maybe even 2 sessions worth of time and die hard gamers one sitting (we are talking 3 to 5 hours, depending on how reload heavy you are and if you are playing with a guide or not.)

Just wait until they patched it once or twice, so your vendors won't stop selling stuff to you, conversations won't get stuck or scripts crash.\n\nShoot streight, always have a trauma patch at hand, save befor every conversation and area transition and never make a deal with a dragon.","August 25, 2015","true","35.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely in-between. Combat-wise, it's not that different from the previous two installments save a few tweaks and the fact you can choose your allies' upgrades, which is a plus.\n\nLike other reviewers have said, the story is a little wanting. At no point are you really drawn into the mystery the same way you were in Dragonfall. Everything kind of happens behind the scenes and it isn't until the very end that your characters figure out what the hell is going on. Compare this to Dragonfall where in learning about the history and the politics of the f-state, you slowly begin to figure out why things are the way they are. There's no deus ex machina, everything in Dragonfall is laid out at the start and you just sink deeper and deeper into the story. Unfortunately, this installment is not as well thought out storywise and in the end, you feel a little cheated.\n\nWhen it comes to tone and atmosphere, it just doesn't feel as sinister as the flux state of Dragonfall. I think the traditional Chinese cultural references feel a little campy. Compared to Berlin, where very little traditional German culture is poking through, it seems strange that futuristic Hong Kong retains so many traditional Chinese values. Real, present day Hong Kong doesn't even act this Chinese.\n\nOn a side note, I understand this is based on a tabletop series and that this Chinese-ness is a staple of cyberpunk, but come on. It's 2015. People should look at actual Hong Kong today and extrapolate from there, the same way they did when conceputalizing the anarchy state of Berlin (which is a mashup of antifa with East Berlin).  Furthermore, many people in Hong Kong can speak English, don't you think a 2050 Hong Kong would have even more English speakers?\n\nDespite these flaws, it has its strengths. Kindly Cheng is a memorable character. The new level up system for your allies is neat. This installment had a lot of potential and if they ever revisit it, I hope they focus more on the corporate espionnage angle/gang warfare.

It's not a "Is that it?" moment as the final missions hold a sense of being epic, but rather I would have wanted to dive further into the city, continue leveling up my fellow runners and being able to test out more abilities. I think that's always a good stamp of approval. Yeah, some things aren't great, but overall it pales to the great ambience and interesting world.\n\nReflections:\nMy first or second run I picked was the one where a potential fellow shadowrunner could be recruited. However I didn't realize this was the case and chose another dialogue option fuelled by the prospect of getting to fight in anotherwise rather combat-less run.

Maybe it was in the other Shadowrun games by Hairbrained and I just didn't notice, but this time around I found myself irritated at a ranged enemy unit sitting in a clever cover position at the start of his action who promptly just runs out in the middle of open space and fires one shot at my tanky runner sitting behind heavy cover. Why not just remain seated and fire at my other, more squishy and already hurt, standing in a angle that allows for flanked attacks? This, and other very unwise choices by enemy NPCs keeps happening over and over again. On hard difficulty.\n\nConclusion:\nFor fans of Shadowrun this is a must get. For the rest ... get a package deal with all three Shadowrun games by Harebrained schemes. If it's not out yet it's bound to happen.","August 30, 2015","true","43.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots of Dialogue, sometimes too much. Setting is great. Music is ok, combat music felt very repetitive. I think I heard the same song over and over for 80% of the battles. I love the changes and additions to cyberware. Played as a Cyberwared-Melee Decker. Money was somewhat of an issue so sometimes you gotta bite your lip and hold out for the best stuff without going for the middle level equipment. Matrix gameplay is different and neat, but still just not that fun. And in certains missions you have to do the decking no matter what, with a time limit no less. I had a great time playing it, maybe not as much as Daggerfall but more than Dead Man's Switch. If they kept making these games, I'd keep buying them. Always feel like they are a good bang for your buck and you'll spend the next few days thinking about the story and looking up alternate endings. The biggest complaint of the entire series is the lack of customization for party members dealing with Karma Points so I imagine replays would get repetitive. But I know it takes alot to balance everything just right for gameplay and storytelling, so that's the price you pay when you run the shadows.","August 30, 2015","true","26.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Blitz mission... the decimated Flux and the awesome reveal of DOG being an uber-hound - the mad orc with a minigun, the gargoyles... the slow decay of the dragonslayer... etc etc eh? Comparing each game is just inevitable.\n\nHong Kong is pretty awesome in its own right though - great commentary from the runners - the reactivity to each mission de-brief was really great. And interesting companion missions. The non-lethal approaches to missions was really refreshing. Kindly Cheng is one of the best characters ive met in the SR games so far - brutal dialogue + very likeable character overall. Ambrose is great, Reliable Matt, Gin, and Crafty all a lot of fun, cyberman and monk not so much. Of the companions Racter is the clear winner - such a cool story. Gaichu gets the 2nd place - but hes ♥♥♥♥ in combat - if he had some 'samurai haste' we could see a far better vision of his intended combat.\n\nMatrix is .. as everyone else has said - not properly scalable to character levels. This makes it look unfinished and all. A simple solution is to have the 'watcher IC' speed slow down after each level-up of the decker... so the initial twitch game becomes less and less important - and high-level deckers feel amazing because they can dodge all the heat like champions. ... plus the mini game is ♥♥♥♥, just ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe art is great as expected the walled city props and maps are really great - not as dark as i'd thought i'd be seeing i mean lighting .... but damn so PRETTY.  I found seeing the 'umbrella squads' as the only vfx 'crowds' and no new 'crowd vfx' disappointing. there is devil rats though - thats one tick on the wishlist done Really loved all the new corporate maps and props - some beautiful work.\n\nThe endgame was ... hell it was as what it should have been - the epilogue counts more to me. Aye theres a boss - thats great and a spectacle - i have no interest in it being an almost impossible battle. i played those games years ago - they suck. The finish to the story was great imo - the epilogue ... - and the surprise that Ray survives - pretty damned cool. ...I am left wanting to have a go at the mini-campaign - and possibly the DC version if it ever gets made.  The writing deserves some credits for being awesome - thanks! - if a minor niggle - i was guessing that there could be a political game of all the yama kings - i was dissapointed and then ok because of their nature being properly revealed.\n\nBack to comparisons - DFDC is better - but ive always felt more effort went into that game.. the devs were really pulling all the stops there . SR Hong Kong is also great - but not a trophy game - therefore it is lesser, generally. This shows - and i dont care really - thats 3.5 entertaining games these cats have made. Keep making more I say! Change it up from time to time and im sure we are all gold.\n\nThanks again HBS great game!","August 31, 2015","true","108.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's as if someone painted Shadowrun's Berlin with "Hong Kong" paint. It's not repetitive, but it is disappointing because it's just too familiar after the first couple hours of game play. HBS needs to mix up their plots a bit and not make them so textbook.\n\nHaving said all this, I still enjoy the game very much because everything else is done right, and despite being a very textbook way to tell a story in-game, the story itself is still very well written.

The point & click controls of SRHK aren't well suited for the kind of navigation you need to do while sneaking. It ends up being more of a source of frustration than something that makes the gameplay more enjoyable.\n>While I enjoy reading through a lot of the dialogue & description of events, sometimes the descriptions were excessive.\n>There are still a fair amount of grammatical errors & formatting errors, especially as you near endgame.\n> Inclredibly long loading times that sometimes end up with the game lagging.\n>The economy in the game isn't sustainable; the profit from selling items is unbelievably small compared to buying them.\n\nPros:\n>The graphics have definitely improved & the atmosphere of the game is much easier to get lost in.\n>Spells & abilities are much more effective compared to the previous games & can actually make a difference in combat.\n>The characters; more than your companions in runs, other characters in Heoi have their own stories & personalities that are varied, & interesting.\n>There are a variety of missions that feel different from each other.\n>While Dragonfall still had the better story imo, Hong Kong also has a solid story with decent pacing & a good amount of depth to leave you invested.\n>The writing is superb as always, & despite being excessive in narration sometimes, the writing can still evoke a lot of emotions & is still full of wit & humor in the right places.\n\nAdmittedly, there are still a lot of cons but hopefully with more patches these issues will be addressed. If you aren't too picky & don't mind a few grammatical errors & formatting, some bugs (none of the ones I got were gamebreaking), and long loading times, then get this game now.

Shadowrun:Hong Kong takes place in a futuristic rendition of its namesake, where technology and magic co-exist alongside with several fantasy sub-human races.\n\n\nThis is a very narrative-driven RPG. The camera is locked in an isometric view with 3d characters running around in a mostly static 2D environment. The graphics are beautiful and lovingly crafted, while the excellent asian-themed musical scores set the mood for your 20~30-hour trek through Hong Kong. In all,  Hong Kong is a fascinating setting for a cyberpunk adventure.\n\n\nGeneral gameplay flow have you undertaking various tasks in Hong Kong while at the same time making progress on the main storyline. After every mission you will return to your base of operations, where you can purchase new equipment, talk to NPCs or check your computer for new missions. Talking to your party members after every mission will allow you to gain new insights into their personality and background, and eventually you'll be able to embark on their own personal quests.\n\n\nProgression is made by mostly clicking on static icons which hover above static NPCS or objects of interest, which I can't help but feel is a missed opportunity. NPCS walking around would've made the beautiful but static environment seem more alive. The missions themselves are very well crafted. There are often multiple solutions to the same problem(although some of them are limited by your team composition and skills), highly increasing replayability and the sense that you're a true Shadowrunner, able to complete the missions in the way you see fitting. Combat is the same as the previous two games, which is a turn-based tactical affair not unlike x-com. There're a variety of skills and weapons at your disposal, understanding your team and making use of cover is key to winning the battles. The matrix system had been revamped from the previous two games. While the idea is good, the game's movement system isn't really suited for the stealth-based parts in the matrix(imagine trying to play Metal Gear with RTS controls) and the actual hacking itself could get repetitive after a few tries.\n\n\nThe true star of the game, however, is its writing. Very few RPGs can write at the level that Shadowrun:Hong Kong does and the writers had truly done a phenomenal job. There are sometimes so much dialogue between missions it felt like it slows down the pacing, but they're all very well written and if you love reading, you're in a for a treat.\n\n\nShadowrun:Hong Kong knows which audience it is catering to, and fans of the first two games are very likely to enjoy this one.\n\n\nPros:\n+Writing is top-notch\n+Hong Kong is an interesting setting\n+Beautiful aesthetics\n+Excellent music\n+Memorable characters\n+Strategic combat\n\nCons:\n-Some overlooked bugs need to be fixed\n-Some solutions are tied to skills rather than real decision-making\n-Not much interactivity with the environment\n-Movement system is not quite suited for stealth sections","September 2, 2015","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I, for example, never considered hiring mercenary runners, because I very quickly learned to appreciate Gobbet and Is0bel.\nThe artstyle is once again on point, the portraits are fitting and the score definetly fits in.\nHB also did a good job on building your home district, Heoi. It catches the flair of a cyberpunky/scifiesque chinatown slum, but you still get to feel at home there.\nThe gameplay is not too different from Dragonfall, but I already liked it back then. If you are into isometric RPGs with turn-based combat, you will feel comfortable here and love the huge amount of possibilities this game offers.\n\nThe story. It's not a bad story. I got pretty absorbed.\nBut it is really straightforward imo. You have the main continuing main quest which progresses really fast and aside from that, only a few runs. The game felt a lot shorter than Dragonfall. Also I miss gimmicks like the Schockwellenreiter or missions in which your crew is personally involved. You do not get that here (or I was too stupid to notice , but then again, I noticed in Dragonfall, where that was really well made).\nYou also do not get to make as many impactful decisions or if you do, they do not feel impactful and I have overlooked them.\n\nSo, this review is a mess, but summing things up:\n\nPro\n\n-Story itself is nice\n-Nice character, level and gameplay design\n-Artstyle and score\n-Well concepted runs\n\nCons\n\n-Feels a bit empty (feel like DF had more runs, also no gimmicks like Schockwellenreiter or that secret dragon guy who always messed with you)\n-No really impactful decisions. It's like an action movie, you have your mission and with the exception of one or two cases, you just gonna stick to it. Of course you have freedom of how to achieve your goal, but you cannot change your goal.\n-Minor Bugs\n\nFinal Statement:\nI had a blast with Shadowrun: Hong Kong.

The end of the campaign just came a little to fast for my liking, I would have liked to see a lot more of the aftermath and to do some more runs, now that I have fixed the most pressing issues.","August 29, 2015","true","27.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only issue I really have is there is ALOT of fluff story to quickly.  Part of that may be my problem but I can't pass people with something to say, and right from the get go you have a book of reading to do if you play this way.  I love a good story but it should have been paced out a bit better where when you come back from missions its a little more each time like the other games instead of an entire book up front.  Really downer on my enjoyment, and since I didn't know if I could do stuff later/story I had to go through entirely to much backstory.  This is personal taste but I would have preffered better pacing like the first two.

The storyline is great, the NPCs are flavorful, and the gameplay is some of the best yet. Cyberware feels much improved, decking is far, far better than it was in the earlier two games, and the changes/upgrades to the body design of the characters is a welcome one, at least for me.\n\nThe only things I can really complain about are the (mostly annoying) bugs and the enormous amount of text errors. The former mostly includes load times steadily increasing as the game goes on and some minor hitching or freezing; I never encountered a CTD or game-breaking error. The latter is nit-picky, but literally the last half of the game has either missing or misplaced words every other text box or so. It really seems like they just used spellcheck and called it done, which is pretty disappointing for such a text-heavy and nicely-written game.\n\nAll-in-all, I would happily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPGs, the Shadowrun universe, or is simply in the mood for a good story with interesting characters.","August 29, 2015","true","62.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hong Kong refines many of the elements present in Dragonfall.

This is especially true if you play a decker like me and you want to buy guns, a deck, programs and cyberware.\n- the game isn't as difficult as Dragonfall. I'm better at the game now, but it was much easier than Dragonfall.

I'd just like to take a moment to compare Shadowrun: Hong Kong, to it's predecessor, Shadowrun: Dragonfall.\n\nPros:\n\n\n+Better UI. Feels more organic and less blocky. Limitations on the Karma screen are more apparent. It is now possible to do a number of simple things that you couldn't before, like equip teammates, distribute acquired items, and swap equipped items with one another.\n\n+The Game does a better job at characterization. Not only with members of the team like Duncan Wu (with whom dialogue choices reveal your history together) but with characterizing some of the other Random NPC shadowrunners you can choose to hire. Note that I'm not saying that the characters are better this time around (that's a matter of personal preference), the game just does a better job presenting them.\n\n+The story is more cinematic. A few motion-comic sequences penctuate key moments of the plot. Not that many though (I think there were three or four).\n\n+Combat is improved and more balanced. Diffrent approaches to combat are more balanced than before. With additional skills and a dedicated merchant, playing a Physical Adept is actually viable this time around. Body has found a derived skill in Cyberware Affinity, which grants additional options to Street Samurai. Mages get a few new tricks like Blood Magic which are kinda OP, but for the most part the balance is welcoming. New items and drugs provide additional options, and are more important than before because...\n\n+AI and Difficulty are improved. IN my honest opinion, both the original  Shadowrun Returns, and Shadowrun:Dragonfall were too easy. Shadowrun: Hong Kong, on it's highest difficulty, is more challenging, and I welcome it.\n\n+Additional options for the Editor. This last one won't matter to most people, but the Shadowrun Editor has gained some new options with this game, like Ambient Sounds and Ley Line control.\n\nCons:\n\n\n-Movement is clunky as ♥♥♥♥. So you click to move, which normally would be fine, except that your squad does a pretty unpredictable job of following you. Sometimes they're right behind you like they should be, other times they inexplicably end up a half mile behind you for no reason, so that when combat suddenly engages 'cause an enemy you didn't see ambushes you, your team needs to waste several turns getting in position. The clunky movement is worsened by the fact that Hong Kong adss STEALTH missions. Thankfully, these aren't instant-fail like some other games, but EVERY time you enter cyberspace, and even for some missions in meatspace, you'll have to fight against the movement system to remain undetected.\n\n-Load times are pretty bad. Loads take much longer in Hong Kong than they did in Dragonfall. This might not be an issue if there weren't so many damn loading screens in Shadowrun. In any case expect to be doing a lot of waiting around. At least the load screens have text.\n\n-Limited Replayablity. This is a problem that Shadowrun: Hong Kong shares with the others, but whereas both previous entries have community-made campaigns availble for them (some pretty damn good ones too, like Antumbra Saga) Time will tell if Hong Kong gets the same kind of support.\n\n-Bugs. This one's still getting worked on, but there are a lot of bugs here that I just didn't see in Dragonfall. Dialogue boxes often have the wrong portraits attatched to them, missions sometimes crash, and NPC conversation trees don't always advance. It may get fixed later, but as of posting it's still an issue.\n\n-Little connection to Shadowrun Lore. Okay, so only hardcore nerds will have a problem with this one, but I think it was a huge missed oppurtunity to explore some of the lore of Shadowrun and of China. But little to no mention is made of the other countries that China's split into (except a brief news report about Sichuan), Lung (the Great Dragon of China) never makes an appearance, and neither does his rival/apprentice, the Japance dragon Ryumyo, even though one of your squadmates is one of his Red Samurai. Overall, just a bit of an annoyance.\n\n-Some of the Chinese is terrible. Again, unless you're bilingual like me, you probably won't catch it, but some of the translated phrases are pretty bad. Especially hillarious is when they literally translated "傻瓜" as "Stupid Melon." And this one bad guy's name in particular, “千牙" is WAY too literal.\n\n\nDon't let the Cons list deter you though, Shadowrun: Hong Kong is an AMAZING game, and if you ever had any love for isometric games, turn-based strategy, or Shadowrun itself, you owe it to yourself to play it.","August 23, 2015","true","99.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Firstly, If you've played the previous 2 games and liked them you will definitely enjoy this as it is essentially the same with a few improvements. If you haven't played the previous two (Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun Dragonfall) I do suggest that if this game interests you that you start with those as the improvements do drastically increase the overall game experience and you might find it hard to go backwards.\n\nThe main improvements, in my opinion, are as follows:\n\n- Charisma plays a very large role in this campaign and most of the ettiquettes are also useful, though I felt academic seemed to be the most important and I only recall seeing gang once. I think the hardest Charisma check is 7, meaning you can dump quite a lot into it and still see some return.\n\n- Allies that have a level up tree, even if it is a little limited.\n\n- Allies that you can talk to out of mission and make you actually care about them. (Think Mass Effect before the ending they wrote with laxatives and stencils.)\n\n- Decking feels much improved generally, with better level design and a minigame that I felt was relatively fun, though the harder ones might frustrate people who dislike being on a timer. Also, it took me a couple of runs to notice that you can flip your bars between ESPs and Programs.\n\n- Melee (At least, the cyber-melee) is actually pretty good due to the ability to stunlock enemies. Haste on my main character meant that I could stunlock 2 enemies at a time with a little luck on my side.\n\n- Equipment... There was always something I wanted to buy that I couldn't afford. In the previous games I felt a little underwhelmed by a lot of stuff, but in this game I feel as if the money income and equipment prices have been nicely paced to make it so that you're always looking out for that little bit of paydata to make all the difference.\n\nAll in all the game took me about 15 hours to complete which means it's about £1 per hour, which is pretty good these days for most non roguelikes.","August 23, 2015","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the 3rd game in the series by Harebrained Schemes and also the best. No knowledge of the previous games is needed to play this one.\n\nIn Shadowrun: Hong Kong, you follow your main character (which you create) and his/her childhood friend to Hong Kong as a request from your childhood father figure. When you arrive, you're ambushed by the police and forced underground to attempt to clear your names of a mythical crime and locate the man who brought you to Hong Kong.\n\nWhat defines this series has always been the writing. You care about this story. You care about the characters. That's really hard to pull off so well and consistently in a video game. You *want* to spend time talking to your partners between missions and learn their backstories. You sympathize with everyone, even your main protagonist. By the end of Dragonfall I missed those characters and thought about them long after the story ended. This is a marvel in modern gaming.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's another rock-solid progression in the series. Great and fluid and fun tactical combat that doesn't feel slow, a highly detailed world to explore, great characters and missions... there's really nothing to not like about this game.\n\nI just can't recommend this series enough.","August 23, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You do not need to play the original or the previous installment to understand this one (though a cursory knowledge of the Shadowrun setting helps.)\nIf you like BioWare games, especially the classes like Baldur's Gate, get this game ASAP.\nIf you like cyberpunk and RPGs, you'll like this game.\nIf you're a fan of later versions of the Shadowrun setting, since this uses an earlier version of rules as its base (and changes those to fit the PC platform) you MAY be put off due to how different it is.\nIt also doesn't have the deepest of combat systems (your party members aren't COMPLETELY customizable, for example) but it's no shallow pool either.\nWhile the characters are quite interesting, they also don't gel quite as much as Dragonfall's cast did.

The point & click controls of SRHK aren't well suited for the kind of navigation you need to do while sneaking. It ends up being more of a source of frustration than something that makes the gameplay more enjoyable.\n>While I enjoy reading through a lot of the dialogue & description of events, sometimes the descriptions were excessive.\n>There are still a fair amount of grammatical errors & formatting errors, especially as you near endgame.\n> Inclredibly long loading times that sometimes end up with the game lagging.\n>The economy in the game isn't sustainable; the profit from selling items is unbelievably small compared to buying them.\n\nPros:\n>The graphics have definitely improved & the atmosphere of the game is much easier to get lost in.\n>Spells & abilities are much more effective compared to the previous games & can actually make a difference in combat.\n>The characters; more than your companions in runs, other characters in Heoi have their own stories & personalities that are varied, & interesting.\n>There are a variety of missions that feel different from each other.\n>While Dragonfall still had the better story imo, Hong Kong also has a solid story with decent pacing & a good amount of depth to leave you invested.\n>The writing is superb as always, & despite being excessive in narration sometimes, the writing can still evoke a lot of emotions & is still full of wit & humor in the right places.\n\nAdmittedly, there are still a lot of cons but hopefully with more patches these issues will be addressed.

It's not that sneaking past them shouldn't be a challenge, but if it's going to be based on player skill, then vision shouldn't be blocked by 3D constructs, or by blacked out areas where the persona supposedly can't see.  The player is in the matrix, so should be able to see everything, because he/she basically sees the code that the matrix consists of, and understands it.\n\n2.  The shadow runners follow too slowly, and sometimes not at all.  This coupled with the fact that a room that you walk into doesn't light up for you to see until several of them finally catch up to you can be annoying.  You should be able to see what's in a  room as soon as you set foot in it.\n\n3. This game is basically an e-book with a couple of battles in it.  There aren't very many "side" missions, and they also don't pay very much.  You would expect by the end game to have acquired enough nuyen to be fully decked out or at least close to it but it's nowhere near like that.  If you are a rigger, you *might* be able to buy two of the best drones, if you don't spend any money for almost all of the missions except one.  I did exactly that; I had to save up about 10k nuyen and then I spent 8 of it on two drones, and the rest on an outfit... after having not spent anything for the majority of the game, and just going only with the equipment I started with.  Missions should pay double what they do now, especially if the player is actually to have the option of hiring extra shadow runners.\n\n4.  I used Duncan's "subdue" on the plastic faced man because the mission stated that the goal was to subdue the plastic faced man after you shoot him with a device.  I shot him with the device, and then stunned with a baton, and then subdued with Duncan's ability and instantly failed the mission, because apparently the game counts strapping someone with zip ties as death.\n\n5.  I had an intelligence of 7, and I was in a museum where there was an option to "look at books" on a bookshelf with a requirement of 3 intelligence, but was blacked out.  I met the requirement but it did not allow me to select it.\n\n6.  Needs more customization.  I selected the character portrait with the dog faced tech mask, which I thought looked super cool.  Unfortunately, your character can never acquire an item like that.  Your portrait rarely looks like the actual in game character.  If the guy in your portrait has a top hat, you will not have a top hat.\n\nBy this point, it would seem I'm blasting the game, but I'm not.  All of these are improvements that could be added to the game that if they were, would make this game absolutely world class.  It is a great game and I highly recommend it, regardless of it's current flaws, and HBS is steadily patching the game, fixing bugs, and making improvements.  This is money well spent, and the story is top notch.","September 3, 2015","true","28.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Choices are still mostly cosmetic, but the combat is still fun and the story is even better.\n\nSpeaking of which, prepare to read. It's like the game's filled with a hundred little short stories, and from the oddest sources, like store sellers. Seriously: everybody you're buying stuff from has a very nice story to tell.\n\nJust don't rush it. I OCD'ed through a lot of content and ended up not only not experiencing it very well, but also got an endgame that was like 4 missions in a row without any new dialogue from anyone. The talks provide actually nice breaks between corporate invasions and the occasional plot mission.\n\nThe gameplay: new stuff -\n\ncyberspace has been revamped (though now you have to stealth around in real time in every which place you jack in, which I didn't enjoy, really - ended up tripping alarms without caring too much and blasting my way through places, which is quite the same as before in Returns & Dragonfall)\n\nthe addition of plot-NPC-specific skills was quite charming; between the cast no one truly sucked, although some were visibly overpowered maybe (looking at Racter here)\n\ncyberweapons! really fun to use\n\nMissions were very well-designed. Little sameyness between them.\n\nNow, the only bad thing about SR Hong Kong:\n\nIt's easy as hell. Seriously, there are about three real challenges in this 30 hour game, even on Hard. And I'm not even a powergamer, though I mostly didn't bother with diplomacy (here's another minus, actually - still didn't seem that diplomatic dialogue would offer any meaningful changes to the way a mission would go. And the etiquette system still sucks).\n\nDo play it like there's no tomorrow if you like the original Fallouts etc. anyhow. This indie CRPG revival is like good sex after a long drought.\n\nAlso, there's one character itg that almost goes the Way of the Carth but doesn't really.

Shadowrun:Hong Kong takes place in a futuristic rendition of its namesake, where technology and magic co-exist alongside with several fantasy sub-human races.\n\n\nThis is a very narrative-driven RPG. The camera is locked in an isometric view with 3d characters running around in a mostly static 2D environment. The graphics are beautiful and lovingly crafted, while the excellent asian-themed musical scores set the mood for your 20~30-hour trek through Hong Kong. In all,  Hong Kong is a fascinating setting for a cyberpunk adventure.\n\n\nGeneral gameplay flow have you undertaking various tasks in Hong Kong while at the same time making progress on the main storyline. After every mission you will return to your base of operations, where you can purchase new equipment, talk to NPCs or check your computer for new missions. Talking to your party members after every mission will allow you to gain new insights into their personality and background, and eventually you'll be able to embark on their own personal quests.\n\n\nProgression is made by mostly clicking on static icons which hover above static NPCS or objects of interest, which I can't help but feel is a missed opportunity. NPCS walking around would've made the beautiful but static environment seem more alive. The missions themselves are very well crafted. There are often multiple solutions to the same problem(although some of them are limited by your team composition and skills), highly increasing replayability and the sense that you're a true Shadowrunner, able to complete the missions in the way you see fitting. Combat is the same as the previous two games, which is a turn-based tactical affair not unlike x-com. There're a variety of skills and weapons at your disposal, understanding your team and making use of cover is key to winning the battles. The matrix system had been revamped from the previous two games. While the idea is good, the game's movement system isn't really suited for the stealth-based parts in the matrix(imagine trying to play Metal Gear with RTS controls) and the actual hacking itself could get repetitive after a few tries.\n\n\nThe true star of the game, however, is its writing. Very few RPGs can write at the level that Shadowrun:Hong Kong does and the writers had truly done a phenomenal job. There are sometimes so much dialogue between missions it felt like it slows down the pacing, but they're all very well written and if you love reading, you're in a for a treat.\n\n\nShadowrun:Hong Kong knows which audience it is catering to, and fans of the first two games are very likely to enjoy this one.\n\n\nPros:\n+Writing is top-notch\n+Hong Kong is an interesting setting\n+Beautiful aesthetics\n+Excellent music\n+Memorable characters\n+Strategic combat\n\nCons:\n-Some overlooked bugs need to be fixed\n-Some solutions are tied to skills rather than real decision-making\n-Not much interactivity with the environment\n-Movement system is not quite suited for stealth sections","September 2, 2015","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, sometimes the writing intrudes on a good action sequence; when this happened I found myself skimming over the text quickly to get back crushing skulls, much to the detriment of the narrative.\n\nThe gameplay is rock solid, with abilities well balanced, giving a real sense of meaninful tactics and risk-reward mechanics. Many times I found myself gambling on a 50% one turn kill over a guaranteed two turn kill with less chance for harm to my party overall.\n\nThe story itself is another (rather trite) "end of the world boogeyman is coming to town, you are the chosen one, Neo" affair. Personally, I'm rather sick of these, they are predictable, worn-out, and not representative of general life in the Shadowrun universe. The story also makes the mistake of trying to force the player to care about a character through pure exposition. "This is your foster father, he's in some trouble, you should care because we tell you to." No, I'm sorry, I can't muster up a single care, there's no emotional connection there because the character I'm meant to care about is just a bit player whom I've never met.\n\nThe main benefit to this particular iteration of the shadowrun franchise will be what people are able to do with all the modding tools and all the new art assets. That said, at time of writing there are no major mods available in the workshop for Hong Kong. Give me a Shadowrun: Roguelike where I can just run the shadows until I retire or die please! Sprinkle on some minor story elements and you have game of the decade.\n\nIf you were a fan of the previous Shadowrun games, or you're a fan of solid tactical turn-based strategy then this game is worth picking up. If you're adverse to large amounts of reading, and sick of god-killer narratives then maybe skip over this one.","September 2, 2015","true","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll admit, the series didn't glue to me until Dragonfall, interesting premise that Returns wasn't able to execute properly. After another Kickstarter, Hairbrained Studios come in to deliver a third journey to the dark deep magical and corrupt world of Shadowrun, this time, in the bustling ciy of Hong Kong. Hope you know how to speak cantonease.\n\nSo here's the the intro of the story: you're an ork, a human or whatever that was just released from a max security corp prison and have been summoned by your foster father to join him in Hong Kong, along with your foster brother. No doubt, nothing will inevitably hit the fan and everything will be alright. In fact, that's what happens, your father wanted to meet up with you and your brother so you can have a nice family reunion. Kind of anti climatic, but enjoyable and simple... ok that doesn't happen. Stuff does go south, rather a bit slowly, and the whole of Honk Kong's police force are looking for you and the party you met upon arrival. At least it's not the London bobbies. Even more, your farther is missing and nothing is making sense. Why were you attacked? Who attacked you? What's behind the fridge?\n\nSo from on there, the story preety much takes the same formula as of Dragonfall: peal out layers from the conspirancy surrounding you, take on varying missions that test you with hard choices, meet fantastic characters and do the Bioware thing where you help them in a Loyalty Mission. AMAZING MISSIONS, ranging from opening a pickle jar for a character to opening TWO pickle jars! I might add that the majority of the 47 hours spent in the game was me reading every line that the game presented me, the dialogue is more than spot on! Can't and couldn't stop reading it! I'm also glad that the game now features a more diverse race of a crewmen, not for the sake of race equality, just to get a more varying story.\n\nI prefer a different location from Hong Kong, but it's nonetheless interesting and the asian background is also explained within the universe's rules and it's quite intriguing.\n\nAs for the combat and general gameplay, it's preety much the same as that of Dragonfall. Read it in my review of it here if you want to: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014021112/recommended/300550/ . You can now also ambush enemies and plan proper "door breach-in" situations. A point to be mentioned, there is no proper tutorial to tell you how its mechanics work. HOWEVER, there's a big change.\n\nDuring the kickstarter, Harebrained promised a revamp of the Matrix areas. The Matrix areas are virtual network world realities. So imagine the internet in a futuristic tron-like world.... actually don't... I did find that the Matrix was quite shallow in previous games. Now, it's a bit of stealth and a bit of puzzle. So the stealth part comes in by figuring out patrol patterns of the guard programs and avoiding. The puzzle involves "Simon Says" interactions and figuring out the right code out of a certain selection. To be honest, this feels more like faffing about, rather than gameplay that makes sense with the rest of the game. It all feels out of tone with the rest of the game. You're reading calmly and performing long thought-out tactics in the combat, THEN PRESS 1,4,5,6,7,2,3 IN THE PRECISE ORDER OR YOU FAIL! DON'T BE CAUGHT BY THE LINE OF SIGHT! Get it? I didn't hate it, but I felt like it didn't belong in the game.\n\nThe game's end boss fight did improve imensly. Now, I'm gonna try to avoid spoilers, even though it's in the title of the game, but in Dragonfall  you get to face a dragon! . Except during the battle it just sits there in front of you doing nothing. You can't even hurt it! Again, without spoiling, the final boss fight of Honk Kong not only makes you fight it but you can also dissuade it. I find it important of the implmentation of the latter because the whole point of the game is to understand the lore of the game and it the final battle, you get to use it as a weapon.\n\nSo the soundtrack is my biggest complain: it's too bland, unorginal and uninspiring. I get it that the studio needed to adapt the sounds to an asian background, but I miss the creative electronic sounds from Returns and Dragonfall. The latter had thematic music that associated with each crewnate. Quite a dissapointment. Aside from that, the game runs fine but there are various bugs to be fixed.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm very satisfied but I do feel like this formula might be getting a tad old. Either way, I felt quite satisfied from the unmonotonous game even though it was a tad long... I recommend it!","August 29, 2015","true","50.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game setting is captivating and from the first moment you are given a lot of reign over the game's direction, and even your own background. Interaction with the world is very detailed and rich, from NPCs conversations to even combat. There are a couple of cons to this shower of praise, however. The game still has some rough edges in certain parts or in certain missions and the length of the main campaign leaves more to be desired. All in all, nothing that can't be fixed.

If you allow yourself some time to follow the conversations between your character and the personas you encounter in a tumultuous, futuristic Hong Kong, the story will suck you in. The beautiful art style of the game really helps the story gain a foothold and the areas in which combat takes place seemlessly blend in with the surrounding environment.

Each Run consists of completing verious objectives, such as kidnapping a target or infiltrating a building. Each mission contains plenty of turn-based violence for you to enjoy. Tactically positioning your squad is a must, for the enemy will try to flank your Shadowrunners whenever possible; increasing the damage you and your squadmates take. Combat is fun, challenging and dynamic, and there are often multiple ways to deal with your opponents: Be it engaging them from afar with heavy (sniper)rifles while your melee fighters sneak in to finish the job, using mages and riggers to summon powerful spiritual and robotic allies to wreak havoc from multiple directions, or even by jacking into the matrix (lol) to cripple the enemy's infrastructure before taking the fight to them head-on. You decide how you want to play.\n\nEven when you are not much into reading the story, the game's combat system is challenging and diverse enough to encourage multiple playthroughs. Having the ability to create a completely different character that you can heavily customize by spending points in different skill trees will make each playthrough significantly different from the last.\n\nThe only minor point of criticism I have is that the choices you make often only have a minor impact on the main storyline. In an RPG, I would expect the (dialogue) options you choose to have a little more impact on how the story unfolds.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game, provided you don't mind reading a lot of dialogue.","August 23, 2015","true","78.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The exposition becomes kinda pointless since it doesn't add anything besides telling you what you can plainly see.\n\nIt would have been fine if it only happened once or twice, but it happens pretty much with every person you encounter.\n\nAnother thing that's sort of annoying is the general state of the game, there are quite a few bugs related to dialogue. Resets, wrong avatars, [description text] becomes plain text that leads to confusion, etc (all of that happens mainly in the later part of the game).\n\nAll that said, it's probably one of the best RPGs I've played this year.","August 28, 2015","true","72.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Role a street samurai and slice up some chummers & gun em down if they try to run. This is one game every Shadowrun fan needs in their library.

Don't get me wrong, i still like the game and if you're familliar with its predecessors and enjoyed them, then you'll like this game too - but maybe with the same sense of 'if only' that i have after wading through it.\n\nFinally, the game mechanics run smoothly with no gaping omissions or unfinished corners (though I found the new matrix 'run & dodge' more irritating than fun). The art is pleasing but the text side of the game (not necessarily the story itself) is like some socially inept bore at a party who pins you to the wall with tedious rhetoric only he finds interesting and has no comprehension of actual conversation. There's so much useless text in this game that my eyes glazed over far too quickly, and i generally like text heavy games. For mood, theme and function (and it was the lack of the last that was particularly notable) presented in text, Baldur's Gate or Planescape Torment this is not. Hong Kong's predecessors were tight and slick in their text use and storytelling while Hong Kong just isn't, it becomes a laborious 'click through' that swamps the better features of what could have been the best iteration of Shadowrun by Harebrained yet.\n\nUltimately, its the editing of the game that is flawed, not the game itself. What a shame. Still, at least it /has/ a good plot and two dimensional characters in gaming are always better than the conventional one. I also think that this game will be much more palatable on a tablet rather than hunched in front of a desktop. Something i think proved true of the other two games too, so maybe wait for that...

IMHO it's an important call:\nI don't see the 1.2 million USD happen in the game (kickstarter money, so it's on top of copies sold). So... either kicstarters were ripped off, or, in the name of presumption of innocence, either much more content will be coming soon or the saga will go on, but without kickstarting the new episodes.\nHarebrained hopefully won't turn into a money raking "something" and don't let people down who gave them their money to make Shadowrun series happen... We'll see...\n2. Not enough money\nI played this time a Shaman and I have to tell, it's far too easy to run out of nuyens. I assume the same applies to the rest of the classes. I was able to buy 2-3 spells throughout the whole game (done all side quests), on top of that, 2x better armor and grenades & 1st aid only. No cyber, new gun or anything. Could be it's my fault on some level but looking at the numbers (nuyens/mission) it's not.\n\nPROS\nThe list is endless, so I'm trying to be brief (and by that, somewhat inaccurate so don't come down hard on me ;)\n1. The game is story rich and built up nicely (real GM wrote it?) as in previous SRs, which is very, very cool!\n2. Many more NPCs and their stories and comments are nice readings\n3. Lovely wording and lots of funny conversations is a huge plus\n4. New matrix is nice, but as I mentioned, would prefer in upcoming SRs a clever mix of old&new\n5. Combat system is the same. Simple enough, fun to fight, have to do tactics\n6. It's a must to have a balanced party (I think it's a plus and I find it important)\n7. The game is stable and reliable (13.5hrs in one row without quitting - no issues at all)\n8. For those who care, GFX got better. Music is fine (not astonishing or very impressive, also not very 'authentic' but it's fine)\n\nLast but not least, with average reading speed (as a non-native), doing all side-quests and pretty much reading everything and talking to everyone, it took 28 hours to play the game through (which is fair for the price, but I'm also planning to play through again with a different class, or maybe pull out Dragonfall, so at the end of the day, it's more bang for the bucks).\n\n\nAlltogether even though text really can be a little too much and money really is a huge minus, the game is fun and HIGHLY recommended.

The storyline is great, the NPCs are flavorful, and the gameplay is some of the best yet. Cyberware feels much improved, decking is far, far better than it was in the earlier two games, and the changes/upgrades to the body design of the characters is a welcome one, at least for me.\n\nThe only things I can really complain about are the (mostly annoying) bugs and the enormous amount of text errors. The former mostly includes load times steadily increasing as the game goes on and some minor hitching or freezing; I never encountered a CTD or game-breaking error. The latter is nit-picky, but literally the last half of the game has either missing or misplaced words every other text box or so. It really seems like they just used spellcheck and called it done, which is pretty disappointing for such a text-heavy and nicely-written game.\n\nAll-in-all, I would happily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPGs, the Shadowrun universe, or is simply in the mood for a good story with interesting characters.","August 29, 2015","true","62.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a "Is that it?" moment as the final missions hold a sense of being epic, but rather I would have wanted to dive further into the city, continue leveling up my fellow runners and being able to test out more abilities. I think that's always a good stamp of approval. Yeah, some things aren't great, but overall it pales to the great ambience and interesting world.\n\nReflections:\nMy first or second run I picked was the one where a potential fellow shadowrunner could be recruited. However I didn't realize this was the case and chose another dialogue option fuelled by the prospect of getting to fight in anotherwise rather combat-less run. To my dismay I now read another review praising the story of that character. I like that the game isn't holding my hand, but that was a bit harsh.\n\nI haven't encountered any bugs in my playthrough, atleast not to my knowledge. But that said, the enemy AI is dreadfully dull. Maybe it was in the other Shadowrun games by Hairbrained and I just didn't notice, but this time around I found myself irritated at a ranged enemy unit sitting in a clever cover position at the start of his action who promptly just runs out in the middle of open space and fires one shot at my tanky runner sitting behind heavy cover. Why not just remain seated and fire at my other, more squishy and already hurt, standing in a angle that allows for flanked attacks? This, and other very unwise choices by enemy NPCs keeps happening over and over again. On hard difficulty.\n\nConclusion:\nFor fans of Shadowrun this is a must get. For the rest ... get a package deal with all three Shadowrun games by Harebrained schemes. If it's not out yet it's bound to happen.","August 30, 2015","true","43.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots of Dialogue, sometimes too much. Setting is great. Music is ok, combat music felt very repetitive. I think I heard the same song over and over for 80% of the battles. I love the changes and additions to cyberware. Played as a Cyberwared-Melee Decker. Money was somewhat of an issue so sometimes you gotta bite your lip and hold out for the best stuff without going for the middle level equipment. Matrix gameplay is different and neat, but still just not that fun. And in certains missions you have to do the decking no matter what, with a time limit no less. I had a great time playing it, maybe not as much as Daggerfall but more than Dead Man's Switch. If they kept making these games, I'd keep buying them. Always feel like they are a good bang for your buck and you'll spend the next few days thinking about the story and looking up alternate endings. The biggest complaint of the entire series is the lack of customization for party members dealing with Karma Points so I imagine replays would get repetitive.

On the linux version you can't even quit the game from the menu, clicking exit does nothing - you have to switch to a virtual console and manually kill the process. HBS have known about this bug since 2013 (it's in the original SRR game too) and done absolutely nothing to fix it (one of many bugs). There are multiple typos and issues with the storyline text (e.g. 'farther' being used instead of 'further').\nI therefore cannot recommend this game in such a bad state for Linux, it might be fine for other platforms, but these issues should not be in all the games in this series for over 2 years.","November 17, 2015","false","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You've been asked to go there by your foster father.\n\nThere are three battles before you even become a shadowrunner; one of them is avoidable, but yeah, there's a high probability of being killed first time out. There's even a Steam achievement for it.\n\nThe Shadowrun games involve a lot of reading. The writers seem to be more novelists than screenwriters, so they're really not concerned with anything seeming too much like a monologue. The balance between reading and playing is good, though. The reading lets you take a break from trying to shoot, fight, or magic your way out of the many encounters. Talking to your group is also encouraged, as some of them will give you missions. Some of the side characters you'll meet along the way will also help you in surprising ways.\n\nIn addition to the character quests, there are many hidden little things in the game that can be easily missed if you don't look around. There are other runners you can meet, more goodies to buy if you have the cash, and some entertaining characters.\n\nThere's also a heavier necessity for a decker, which seems to be why the decking virtual world has been given a major upgrade since the last game. It looks much better, and has a few more challenges to it. There are times in the game when a decker is absolutely necessary, and other times when a decker can help to avoid a battle, or even save everyone's lives.\n\nUltimately, though, the Shadowrun gameplay experience is looking very dated, especially after XCOM, and the upcoming XCOM2. Ideally, for the next Shadowrun game, I'd like to see more 3D, a rotatable map, and a lot more voice acting. Harebrained Schemes have improved their storytelling immensely since Shawrun Returns, but now it's time for them to improve the gameplay experience with some new technologies.","August 26, 2015","true","38.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No longer do you have to just smash and grab your way to victory. A lot more Matrix action intertwined with regular charming through, or if you butched it an all out firefight with heavily armed security, while the clock is ticking. Manipulation of people and hardware to gain accsess to areas you are not supposed to be in and in the final act s*t hits the fan and you know what they say? Once s*it hits the fan, no one comes out clean. Those final missions felt like shadowrun, looked like shadowrun and quite franquly were what I was missing in the rest of the game. I will stick to my former statement, that the game has huge issues, is (at the moment) buggy to no end and lacks a proper pacing / story telling untill you reach the final chapter, but I will say that fans of the universe will love what is coming after they fought their way through the early / mid game.\nIt makes me wonder if those other runs where only implemented to get the game to a proper length, they sure feel like they were lacking love and attention (with some exceptions.)\n\nNow that I have seen the end, which will take a "casual" gamer about 1, maybe even 2 sessions worth of time and die hard gamers one sitting (we are talking 3 to 5 hours, depending on how reload heavy you are and if you are playing with a guide or not.) I can savely say: It is worth it, if you can endure the lack of atmosphere at the beginning. Just wait until they patched it once or twice, so your vendors won't stop selling stuff to you, conversations won't get stuck or scripts crash.\n\nShoot streight, always have a trauma patch at hand, save befor every conversation and area transition and never make a deal with a dragon.","August 25, 2015","true","35.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely in-between. Combat-wise, it's not that different from the previous two installments save a few tweaks and the fact you can choose your allies' upgrades, which is a plus.\n\nLike other reviewers have said, the story is a little wanting. At no point are you really drawn into the mystery the same way you were in Dragonfall. Everything kind of happens behind the scenes and it isn't until the very end that your characters figure out what the hell is going on. Compare this to Dragonfall where in learning about the history and the politics of the f-state, you slowly begin to figure out why things are the way they are. There's no deus ex machina, everything in Dragonfall is laid out at the start and you just sink deeper and deeper into the story. Unfortunately, this installment is not as well thought out storywise and in the end, you feel a little cheated.\n\nWhen it comes to tone and atmosphere, it just doesn't feel as sinister as the flux state of Dragonfall. I think the traditional Chinese cultural references feel a little campy. Compared to Berlin, where very little traditional German culture is poking through, it seems strange that futuristic Hong Kong retains so many traditional Chinese values. Real, present day Hong Kong doesn't even act this Chinese.\n\nOn a side note, I understand this is based on a tabletop series and that this Chinese-ness is a staple of cyberpunk, but come on. It's 2015. People should look at actual Hong Kong today and extrapolate from there, the same way they did when conceputalizing the anarchy state of Berlin (which is a mashup of antifa with East Berlin).  Furthermore, many people in Hong Kong can speak English, don't you think a 2050 Hong Kong would have even more English speakers?\n\nDespite these flaws, it has its strengths. Kindly Cheng is a memorable character. The new level up system for your allies is neat. This installment had a lot of potential and if they ever revisit it, I hope they focus more on the corporate espionnage angle/gang warfare. It was a much more interesting subplot than the main arc.","August 25, 2015","true","97.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I'm not even a powergamer, though I mostly didn't bother with diplomacy (here's another minus, actually - still didn't seem that diplomatic dialogue would offer any meaningful changes to the way a mission would go. And the etiquette system still sucks).\n\nDo play it like there's no tomorrow if you like the original Fallouts etc. anyhow.

Firstly, If you've played the previous 2 games and liked them you will definitely enjoy this as it is essentially the same with a few improvements. If you haven't played the previous two (Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun Dragonfall) I do suggest that if this game interests you that you start with those as the improvements do drastically increase the overall game experience and you might find it hard to go backwards.\n\nThe main improvements, in my opinion, are as follows:\n\n- Charisma plays a very large role in this campaign and most of the ettiquettes are also useful, though I felt academic seemed to be the most important and I only recall seeing gang once. I think the hardest Charisma check is 7, meaning you can dump quite a lot into it and still see some return.\n\n- Allies that have a level up tree, even if it is a little limited.\n\n- Allies that you can talk to out of mission and make you actually care about them. (Think Mass Effect before the ending they wrote with laxatives and stencils.)\n\n- Decking feels much improved generally, with better level design and a minigame that I felt was relatively fun, though the harder ones might frustrate people who dislike being on a timer. Also, it took me a couple of runs to notice that you can flip your bars between ESPs and Programs.\n\n- Melee (At least, the cyber-melee) is actually pretty good due to the ability to stunlock enemies. Haste on my main character meant that I could stunlock 2 enemies at a time with a little luck on my side.\n\n- Equipment... There was always something I wanted to buy that I couldn't afford. In the previous games I felt a little underwhelmed by a lot of stuff, but in this game I feel as if the money income and equipment prices have been nicely paced to make it so that you're always looking out for that little bit of paydata to make all the difference.\n\nAll in all the game took me about 15 hours to complete which means it's about £1 per hour, which is pretty good these days for most non roguelikes.","August 23, 2015","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/envixer/recommended/346940/","envixer","Ayoub","http://steamcommunity.com/id/envixer/","127 products in account","Full disclosure: I backed this game on Kickstarter, and I backed it because I loved playing Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall.\n\nThe game starts out with our hero, after you create him or her, getting off a boat to meet their childhood friend and foster brother in Hong Kong. You've been asked to go there by your foster father.\n\nThere are three battles before you even become a shadowrunner; one of them is avoidable, but yeah, there's a high probability of being killed first time out. There's even a Steam achievement for it.\n\nThe Shadowrun games involve a lot of reading. The writers seem to be more novelists than screenwriters, so they're really not concerned with anything seeming too much like a monologue. The balance between reading and playing is good, though. The reading lets you take a break from trying to shoot, fight, or magic your way out of the many encounters. Talking to your group is also encouraged, as some of them will give you missions. Some of the side characters you'll meet along the way will also help you in surprising ways.\n\nIn addition to the character quests, there are many hidden little things in the game that can be easily missed if you don't look around. There are other runners you can meet, more goodies to buy if you have the cash, and some entertaining characters.\n\nThere's also a heavier necessity for a decker, which seems to be why the decking virtual world has been given a major upgrade since the last game. It looks much better, and has a few more challenges to it. There are times in the game when a decker is absolutely necessary, and other times when a decker can help to avoid a battle, or even save everyone's lives.\n\nUltimately, though, the Shadowrun gameplay experience is looking very dated, especially after XCOM, and the upcoming XCOM2. Ideally, for the next Shadowrun game, I'd like to see more 3D, a rotatable map, and a lot more voice acting. Harebrained Schemes have improved their storytelling immensely since Shawrun Returns, but now it's time for them to improve the gameplay experience with some new technologies.","August 26, 2015","true","38.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It runs on some completely new rules and features. Instead of fighting IC turn by turn, you have to play a stealth game where you slip past patrols of IC. If they see you, they keep doing system trace until you kill them. In order to get to data nodes, you also have to get past blocker IC. You can force your way past it, but it adds more system trace. Get too much system trace, and black IC will show up and kill you, so it's not an ideal soloution. Instead, you will have to play a mini simon says game and a matching symbols type thing.\n\nThese mini-games are extremely difficult and tedious. They aren't fun and I had no idea what the developers were thinking. It also takes you away from the game and your character, because suddenly you're not relying on your characters' skills, but rather your own skills. Obviously this is anti-thetical to the point of an RPG game. The old matrix system was fun and enjoyable, there was no need to change it. Also, you can't supress except for in combat. What?\n\nSecondly, this game is way too easy. I played through the whole game on the hardest difficulty and easily tore through the combat encounters like they were kleenex. I only died twice, and I think one time it was an accident. The game is so easy that it provides no tactical challenge, and I was honestly losing interest about halfway through. It's twice as easy as Dragonfall, which is actually challenging and keeps you engaged.\n\nThird, this game is unacceptably buggy. I would click an ability and some other ability would be selected, not the one I wanted. I had characters glitch out and be unavailable for dialouge, leading to me not being able to complete conversations, quests, or storylines. What an extreme buzzkill. I also had the screen CONSTANTLY freeze up on me when returning from missions. The bugs in this game are unbelievably frustrating and tedious, and honestly ruin the experience.\n\nFourth, I found that the diaoluge was extremely verbose. Characters re-hash the same point over and over again and the game tried too hard to be melodramatic. It get's old fast because you're sitting there thinking "Ok I get it, let's move on alreadly." The story really drags in a few places as well, taking too much time focusing on unimportant things or holding your hand.\n\nFifth, the game is way too short. It doesn't have that many missions at all, and some of the missions are quite short. The game feels artificially fleshed out with too much dialouge and melodrama to cover up the fact that the gameplay is sparse, which only makes it feel even MORE sparse.\n\nSixth, there was annoying thing where one of the main companions was hidden in a side quest, you can only get him if you do that side quest. Only, you don't know that ahead of time. So if you wait to do that mission, you won't have enough time with him to get to know his story and character. I feel bummed out over a huge loss like that, super lame.\n\nOkay, there are a few good things though. Rigging has been improved dramatically. It sucked in the other games because drones are weak and there isn't that much variety. This game fixes that problem by adding new kinds of drones and makes them more bad-♥♥♥. So that's a huge bonus if you like rigging.\n\nThey did add new magic as well, but at the same time they took away some of the spells from the previous games. So basically it's a wash. I don't get why they would do that, but oh well.\n\nThere is also a new skill tree, cyber affinity. Can't comment on that as I didn't try it.\n\nConclusion:\n\nHong Kong has a lot of the same elements that Dragonfall did, but in many ways it takes a step back. In fact it almost takes a step back in some minor way in every aspect. While there are inmprovements, there are underwhlemed by the negetive changes the developers made. At the core, it's still a good game with strong RPG elements. And it is a cheap game. So I give it thumbs up, but my official verdict is "mediocre".","August 26, 2015","true","50.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The storyline is great, the NPCs are flavorful, and the gameplay is some of the best yet. Cyberware feels much improved, decking is far, far better than it was in the earlier two games, and the changes/upgrades to the body design of the characters is a welcome one, at least for me.\n\nThe only things I can really complain about are the (mostly annoying) bugs and the enormous amount of text errors. The former mostly includes load times steadily increasing as the game goes on and some minor hitching or freezing; I never encountered a CTD or game-breaking error. The latter is nit-picky, but literally the last half of the game has either missing or misplaced words every other text box or so. It really seems like they just used spellcheck and called it done, which is pretty disappointing for such a text-heavy and nicely-written game.\n\nAll-in-all, I would happily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPGs, the Shadowrun universe, or is simply in the mood for a good story with interesting characters.","August 29, 2015","true","62.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of cameos from past series.\nGameplay wise, there isn't much changes from Dragonfall but Matrix part has gone thru major revamped!\nFor those want challenge, tried completing the game with least amount of killing, just decking and bulls#!t your way.","August 29, 2015","true","30.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a "Is that it?" moment as the final missions hold a sense of being epic, but rather I would have wanted to dive further into the city, continue leveling up my fellow runners and being able to test out more abilities. I think that's always a good stamp of approval. Yeah, some things aren't great, but overall it pales to the great ambience and interesting world.\n\nReflections:\nMy first or second run I picked was the one where a potential fellow shadowrunner could be recruited. However I didn't realize this was the case and chose another dialogue option fuelled by the prospect of getting to fight in anotherwise rather combat-less run. To my dismay I now read another review praising the story of that character. I like that the game isn't holding my hand, but that was a bit harsh.\n\nI haven't encountered any bugs in my playthrough, atleast not to my knowledge. But that said, the enemy AI is dreadfully dull. Maybe it was in the other Shadowrun games by Hairbrained and I just didn't notice, but this time around I found myself irritated at a ranged enemy unit sitting in a clever cover position at the start of his action who promptly just runs out in the middle of open space and fires one shot at my tanky runner sitting behind heavy cover. Why not just remain seated and fire at my other, more squishy and already hurt, standing in a angle that allows for flanked attacks? This, and other very unwise choices by enemy NPCs keeps happening over and over again. On hard difficulty.\n\nConclusion:\nFor fans of Shadowrun this is a must get. For the rest ... get a package deal with all three Shadowrun games by Harebrained schemes.

And I'll play it again and again - it has quite a bit of replay value!\n\nThis one is to me more like a book made into a RPG (with a twist - initially you choose something like a "profession"  - which you can expand upon - that give you initial stat bonuses, but at least there are no class restrictions - yay!) with turn-based combat (somewhat like XCOM, but not as strategic IMO, but at least allows you to use cover, as a strategic element, plus you have special abilities).\n\nIt has a deep, developing story with a blend of organized crime (gang / chinese mafia), sci-fi, fantasy and some mysticism all very well blended together. All the main characters have a strong personality and personality development (some of which you have somewhat an influence on).\n\nDialog and dialog options are also very well done - more about that below.\n\nThe RPG element (character stat system) IMO is very well done - it doesn't just consist of strength, intelligence, stamina, ... like in most RPGs - instead, these are the main stats, and then they have somewhere between four to seven (I think) sub-stats. Very cool, adds additional strategy and customization elements.\n\nSRHK is VERY story-rich - so, if you're not into reading a lot, then this might not be your thing. Well, you don't have to read everything, but you'll lose out on a lot of story.\n\nIts main elements and their strengths:\n\n* RPG\nCertain "activities" (main "quests", side-quests) earn you points that you can then use to increase the stats of your character (NPCs don't level up their stats, but get new abilities, which you have to choose then, one of two each time, similar to XCOM). Stat points are not just handed out generously - you really have to decide which direction you want your character to develop, if you level up all the stats more or less evenly, then they can use any and all type of equipment, but will in the long run just be mediocre in the use of those. Additionally, some stats and a certain level of them unlock additional conversation choices. So, as a tip, it's advisable not to allocate any stat points unless absolutely necessary!\n\n* Cybernetics\nPart of the RPG element - but, you don't use stat points for those, instead money. Also, there's something like a "life force" that starts out at a certain number and almost all cybernetic implant decreases that by a certain amount - the resulting number can not fall below 1 (1 basically means, you're almost more machine than human). Cybernetics either give your character additional abilities, or, in most cases, increases their stats.\n\n* Conversation\nMost other RPGs have one-liners. Not this one (in most cases) - it seems like the characters actually have full-fledged conversations going on. Which adds to the realism aspect and immersion factor, SRHK therefore doesn't just seem like a turn-based combat game with some story slapped on, but rather the opposite. Also as mentioned before, some conversation options are unlocked based on your stats (and some on your "trait" that you initially choose).\n\n* Story\nGames trying to blend realism, sci-fi and fantasy together usually end up in a huge mess, story wise at least, because things just don't add up... logically there are just things that don't make sense. This one even adds "mysticism" to the mix - and it all works! It seems to me that the writers of the story didn't just "force" all these elements in there, but rather, elements were added to support the overall story.\n\n* NPCs\nThere are quite a wide variety, even some "supernatural" ones - I'm not going into detail here to avoid spoilers, but trust me, it makes sense and is actually really well done, ties well into the story! At least I had a blast, laughing quite a lot because of the turn of events and the explanation of those... so well done!\n\nLast but not least (and literally, that is the weakest, yet still not terrible, part of SRHK):\n\n* Combat\nSometimes you can avoid getting into a fight by choosing certain dialog option(s) and overall approach to a situation, but often combat is unavoidable. It's turn-based and you have weapons to use - melee or ranged - and some abilities. You can (and should) make use of cover, which is divided into three categories: weak (pretty much non-existence), low (partial cover) or high (strong cover). You can use certain abilities to improve damage, but you can't target certain parts of the enemy's body, nor can you blow up cover or items (such as furniture) - again, it's not as sophisticated as XCOM and of course a long shot (no pun intended hehe) from Jagged Alliance. Yet, all in all, it's satisfactory and for those who just really don't care for combat, they still have to though but at least on lowest difficult setting, it's a breeze and quickly over with.\n\nAlso, a quick note, combat can also take place in "virtual reality", which, although slightly different, is in general the same as non-vr combat. And can in most if not all cases all together be avoided.","September 11, 2015","true","55.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PurpleXVI/recommended/346940/","PurpleXVI","PurpleXVI","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PurpleXVI/","535 products in account","Playing Shadowrun: Hong Kong left me feeling somewhat conflicted. Firstly, the writing was great, but that's never been a problem for Harebrained Schemes, generally the dialogue is witty and funny and excellent, even if the "plotlines" for missions do tend to resemble each other a bit and things go wrong so often it's more of a surprise when things go to plan.\n\nThe basic gameplay also wasn't any worse than the original SRR or SR: Dragonfall, with a few noted improvements(decking has been improved somewhat), but it felt like it was just too easy. Playing on Normal, I think I had a total of one challenging battle(mostly because I was lazy) and zero challenging choices or puzzles. It simply felt too hard NOT to do the right thing, I'd have had to be blind and an idiot to screw something up, I never really felt like I had to think, which is a damn shame.\n\nThe game also really felt very short. The actual core plotline, which has a very creative premise, consumes about four missions, counting generously... while there's about twice as many side missions. Which is a damn shame, because I wanted to dig more into the actual premise, and I wanted to drag it out a bit so they could actually do something with the atmospheric writing they were getting into, maybe do a bit of horror. Instead the climax they've been setting up consists of about three fights with a short corridor in between each, none of which are as big or challenging as the ones at the end of Dragonfall(...or even really the original SRR). The shortness and lack of fights is also a bit of a shame because the nice level-up system for the companions gets little play as a result, Gobbet had some handy powers for manipulating enemy spirit summons... but I think I had a total of two enemies in the entire game who ever summoned a spirit.\n\nWhich, again, is a shame, because I really liked most members of my team(except for Wu and Is0bel, which... is kind of a shame, because he was supposed to be core to the plot, instead he just comes across as kind of dull, and you'll basically always be stuck with Is0bel if you're not a decker yourself, but mostly what she does is complain about how bad her past was) while Racter, Gaichu and Gobbet are all fun to deal with and talk to.\n\nIn general, the core plot suffered from a few major issues. Firstly, it was never really given any time to work itself out, it was over too quickly for any impact. Secondly, it was hard to care about Raymond when he was a character you were only told about, basically never met, the game could have done with more flashbacks, or maybe even an intro gameplay segment set BEFORE the current era. Thirdly, as a result of it being hard to care about Raymond, it became hard to care about Wu, because his entire thing is basically just Raymond Raymond Raymond Raymond My Dad Raymond My Dad.\n\nI genuinely dug the side missions, but I can't help but feel that SR:HK would have been better if they scrapped them and put all those missions into the core plot instead.\n\nStill, the writing was fun enough that I don't feel like I wasted my time playing it.\n\nExcept for one thing.\n\nWHERE'S MY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GOBBET ROMANCE, YOU NERDS.\n\nOR AT LEAST KU FENG.\n\nBOO.","September 10, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Veteran fans beware.)\n\nGonna be honest with you here. This is the best version so far. I have all three games, and I can say that, without a doubt, this is the best version so far. Not because it's the newest. Not because it's the shiniest. But because it adds so much to the previous two games that I found myself having to read the tutorials despite playing the previous two games for hours on end. If you've played the previous two games in this series, you will not be disappointed on a gameplay front, as they have added so much since they original game.\n\nIn short, among the weapons, new locations, new characters, and whatnot, they have made two major modifications to the core gameplay: Adept alterations and fundamental changes to the roles of the Decker class.\n\nBefore, the Adept was a somewhat servicable, if not very specialized, substitute for a melee Street Samurai. Now? Well, they're still a substitute for a melee Street Samurai, but they have added a new mechanic for the class that shakes up so much. Basically, what they have added are stances for the Adepts to adopt to alter their fighting styles, such as increased defense and dodge capabilities in exchange for reduced HP damage or just straight out AP damage, or increased damage in exchange for reduced dodge and defense. Basic stuff, nothing too special or out of the ordinary for most differing "stances" in other games, but now the Adept is more than just a guy who can swing twice per turn. Now they can actually stand a chance against guys with guns if they are caught off guard. Want to know the best part? I'm fairly certain that I'm leaving out at least 2 stances, because I specifically remember an NPC ingame talking about 5 different stances, and how each stance can counteract another based on its elemental leanings!\n\nThe Deckers, however, have had the biggest change to their core gameplay in that they are no longer just mages in another location. Now, they have basic stealth mechanics to avoid drawing the attention of enemy deckers and Black IC units to themselves, and the hacking is no longer just click and done. It now requires the player to solve a puzzle of "which sequence is correct?" The longer the player waits, the more symbols and their locations are revealed, and in order to successfully hack, you must find the correct sequence of symbols before the timer runs out, or else you raise the alarm bar by a certain number of points. It's much more tense and, frankly, more fun than the previous iteration of the Deckers. So, yes, I would recommend this game based on its gameplay changes alone. But is the story good? Well, I don't know yet. I haven't beaten the game yet. But I will edit this review when I do finish it. The characters in the game, however, I CAN vouch for in my current state of completion, and I will say that the characters are very well-written and fleshed out. The party member missions take place much earlier than Dragonfall, so I've had time to bond with them even quicker, and the quests, once you complete them, do not stop affecting them afterwards. I finished Is0bel's quest and she's STILL dealing with the baggage! I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of the previous two.","September 6, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a dark setting where you are opperating in shades of grey at best. It is set in a world where magic meets technology. They creators showed a good understanding of hong kong, better than just a quick google search. If you have been to the city, you will have a familiar feeling with this game.\n\nIt is a story heavy game, so be prepared to read a lot of dialogue. If you want to skip to the action this may not be the game for you. If you want a rich story with deep characters, though, this is likely to fit the bill. The NPCs are fleshed out and believable with their own story arks. You have a number of options to define your character as well.\n\nGame play wise, it is a fairly tactical game. Be prepared to look for cover and plan your moves carefully. Combat can be slow, especially if you play it like a game of chess. However, it gives you a great deal of options. The matrix section can depend a bit on your tastes. If you like stepping away from combat to solve puzzles you will probably enjoy them more. For the most part, though, the matrix is skippable if you don't want to bother with it.\n\nYour actions will have consequences in the game. Some more long term than others. You can choose to fight or talk your way through many situations. Who you let live or ally with can impact the story later on. While I would have liked to have seen more hard moral choices, over all the options presented seem believable and organic.","October 13, 2015","true","119.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sleeping Dogs knocked it right out of the park with sheer authenticity, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong has managed to translate Hong Kong effectively into the Shadowrun Universe. Feng shui is an actual thing, there's the typical Chinese obsession with the number 8 everywhere (Club 88, 8 members in the Council) and there are accurate references to how the Hong Kong Triads work. I love it.\n\nKarma levelling system has been given a more coherent UI, and even though most of the combat system is still the same as Dragonfall and Returns, the revamp to the Decking sequences is praiseworthy. Movement in the decking cyberspace is real-time and your avatar gets to evade the roaming ICE Metal Gear-style, which is a huge improvement. The turn-based combat kicks in only when you've been detected.\n\nThere's plenty more to be looked at, but based on what I've seen so far? 10/10.

On top of the standard show-mercy-or-accept-more-pay style options whose scope is generally limited to a single quest, the player is now forced to make more decisions that not only have moral implications, but whose consequences affect the entire course of the story.\nI spent about 30 hours playing the main campaign as well as most of the optional side content.\n\nI played through SR:HK on Ubuntu 15.04 and 15.10, no issues encountered.\nAdditionally, I played the last ⅓ or so on a big screen using a Steam controller - the "High Resolution Display" option in the game settings made this a flawless experience.\n\nConclusion: if you like RPGs, if you like great story, if you like the idea of a neon-filled future where it never stops raining - play Shadowrun: Hong Kong","November 29, 2015","true","76.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I already love the game.\nThis shall be a first "look on the game", and I will complete this review, when I finished the game.\n\nTechnical aspects:\nTechnical it is based on a quite similar engine as the previous Shadowrun-titles of Harebrained for the first look. Can't say if it's not the same, because it definitely looks better.\nI occurred some minor bugs and some glitches, which were not affecting me fatal, so I can live with that. A game has not to be perfectly progammed to be good.\n\nStory:\nThanks to not hiring actors to speak every conversation there was enough money to put much effort in storytelling. I did 2-3 sidequests and they simply were amazing. (I did the seriel-killer quest and was amazed by the ending...)\nI really look forward to the ongoing story and will surely do a lot of sidequests now.\n\nAt the first look, this is a game worth buying. And as mentioned before (and in the tradition of 1990's TV-shows):\n\nTo be continued...\n\nEDIT:\nSo, after I finished I let the game pass some time into the depths of my memory.\nAnd the result is, that I think this game is too short. I'd wish to have more missions. The earlier titles felt more complex in it's story.\nDon't get me wrong, I really like this game. The way it's story is written, the way the events occurr, all is fine. Just too short.\n\nThe only bug I found, was the moment, where I was able to decide to let a monster free (two options here) or to kill it. Triggers didn't work here and my last savegame was a hour away. Thanks to autosave I hadn't to repeat it all.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you liked the previous titles you should definitely give it a look. If you never played Shadowrun before, better start with Shadowrun: Dragonfall.","August 22, 2015","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very similar to the earlier Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun Dragonfall, this features updated items and cyberware, as well as a completely reworked Matrix, in a new area of the Shadowrun universe.\n\nPersonally, I feel that the story of Hong Kong is not as good as Dragonfall by a decent margin, but any shortcoming in that area is made up in significantly improved gameplay. Riggers now have options between "One offensive drone and one defensive drone," Matrix sequences feel more distinct from meatspace combat, new cyberware opens up completely new character builds, and so on and so forth. Also, while I said the story isn't as good as Dragonfall, don't let that indicate it's a bad story; Dragonfall was simply exceptional.","December 9, 2015","true","110.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I'll play it again and again - it has quite a bit of replay value!\n\nThis one is to me more like a book made into a RPG (with a twist - initially you choose something like a "profession"  - which you can expand upon - that give you initial stat bonuses, but at least there are no class restrictions - yay!) with turn-based combat (somewhat like XCOM, but not as strategic IMO, but at least allows you to use cover, as a strategic element, plus you have special abilities).\n\nIt has a deep, developing story with a blend of organized crime (gang / chinese mafia), sci-fi, fantasy and some mysticism all very well blended together. All the main characters have a strong personality and personality development (some of which you have somewhat an influence on).\n\nDialog and dialog options are also very well done - more about that below.\n\nThe RPG element (character stat system) IMO is very well done - it doesn't just consist of strength, intelligence, stamina, ... like in most RPGs - instead, these are the main stats, and then they have somewhere between four to seven (I think) sub-stats. Very cool, adds additional strategy and customization elements.\n\nSRHK is VERY story-rich - so, if you're not into reading a lot, then this might not be your thing. Well, you don't have to read everything, but you'll lose out on a lot of story.\n\nIts main elements and their strengths:\n\n* RPG\nCertain "activities" (main "quests", side-quests) earn you points that you can then use to increase the stats of your character (NPCs don't level up their stats, but get new abilities, which you have to choose then, one of two each time, similar to XCOM). Stat points are not just handed out generously - you really have to decide which direction you want your character to develop, if you level up all the stats more or less evenly, then they can use any and all type of equipment, but will in the long run just be mediocre in the use of those. Additionally, some stats and a certain level of them unlock additional conversation choices. So, as a tip, it's advisable not to allocate any stat points unless absolutely necessary!\n\n* Cybernetics\nPart of the RPG element - but, you don't use stat points for those, instead money. Also, there's something like a "life force" that starts out at a certain number and almost all cybernetic implant decreases that by a certain amount - the resulting number can not fall below 1 (1 basically means, you're almost more machine than human). Cybernetics either give your character additional abilities, or, in most cases, increases their stats.\n\n* Conversation\nMost other RPGs have one-liners. Not this one (in most cases) - it seems like the characters actually have full-fledged conversations going on. Which adds to the realism aspect and immersion factor, SRHK therefore doesn't just seem like a turn-based combat game with some story slapped on, but rather the opposite. Also as mentioned before, some conversation options are unlocked based on your stats (and some on your "trait" that you initially choose).\n\n* Story\nGames trying to blend realism, sci-fi and fantasy together usually end up in a huge mess, story wise at least, because things just don't add up... logically there are just things that don't make sense. This one even adds "mysticism" to the mix - and it all works! It seems to me that the writers of the story didn't just "force" all these elements in there, but rather, elements were added to support the overall story.\n\n* NPCs\nThere are quite a wide variety, even some "supernatural" ones - I'm not going into detail here to avoid spoilers, but trust me, it makes sense and is actually really well done, ties well into the story! At least I had a blast, laughing quite a lot because of the turn of events and the explanation of those... so well done!\n\nLast but not least (and literally, that is the weakest, yet still not terrible, part of SRHK):\n\n* Combat\nSometimes you can avoid getting into a fight by choosing certain dialog option(s) and overall approach to a situation, but often combat is unavoidable. It's turn-based and you have weapons to use - melee or ranged - and some abilities. You can (and should) make use of cover, which is divided into three categories: weak (pretty much non-existence), low (partial cover) or high (strong cover). You can use certain abilities to improve damage, but you can't target certain parts of the enemy's body, nor can you blow up cover or items (such as furniture) - again, it's not as sophisticated as XCOM and of course a long shot (no pun intended hehe) from Jagged Alliance. Yet, all in all, it's satisfactory and for those who just really don't care for combat, they still have to though but at least on lowest difficult setting, it's a breeze and quickly over with.\n\nAlso, a quick note, combat can also take place in "virtual reality", which, although slightly different, is in general the same as non-vr combat. And can in most if not all cases all together be avoided.","September 11, 2015","true","55.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, this game plays the same, but to me, it's exceptional and surpasses Returns in every way! I should note though that I will go back to Returns after playing this.\n\nThe main point here is that the story is spectacular. I wanted to pry more into the dialogue options (and there are MANY) and was rewarded with a fleshed out story. It's practically a book inside a game. Now of course, you don't have to divulge into the lore. There's options to prod more into a conversation, which I did. I'd say at least half of my gameplay is reading. It really is interesting though and so very entertaining.\n\nThe art is spectacular! Hong Kong looks great as far as a dystopian world goes. The music is very asian-esq and captures the mood.\n\nIf you're a fan of XCOM's combat, or turn-based in general, you'll like this. There are plenty of options to choose from. I for one was a shaman that relied on support abilities to help my team, but was also quite adept at the pistol. If I felt like it, I could have focused all on magic, or all on pistols... or I can focus on other weapons too.

Just gonna throw that out here.\n\nSo, is this game good? Well, after binging through eight solid hours of it on launch day my opinion is that of my new favorite shaman after we did a run involving a museum heist, the walking dead, and ancient magic tomes: "That. Was. AWESOME!"\n\nFor those of you who haven't played the other two games in the series; Shadowrun Returns and S.R: Dragonfall... NO! BAD GAMER! GO PLAY THEM! GO DO IT RIGHT NOW OR I'M GETTING MY BEATING STICK!\n\nFor those of you who are fans already, this game met all it's kickstarter goals and, as promised, they pulled out every stop and completely redid many aspects of the game... so here's whats new:\n\nGraphics: The graphics look MUCH sharper and more detailed in this than in the previous two games. The difference is akin to going from one generation of game systems to the next really. The animation is a lot smoother, the spell effects have been redesigned, the elementals that shaman summon look different (though that might just be the Chinese setting), and so on.\n\nStory: I'm going to wager that I've gotten about a third or so through the story, but so far it's a HUGE improvement over even Dragonfall's lofty heights. Fully voiced cutscenes, a lot more dynamic action in the story itself, and so on. Right at the start, within the first ten minutes, you're leading your foster brother and two shadowrunners through a hail of corp police gunfire to safety after watching your brother's partner and two of the shadowrunner's teammates get a surprise headache via a high powered sniper rifle... and thats all I'm going to say. The series has always had amazing writing and this game has taken it up even higher than it was before.\n\nCombat: They changed around the UI a lot in this one, but I'm liking it so far. There's new weapons to find and use, new tactics, lots of new spells for mages and shaman to use... but here's the big one for me.\n\nI'm an IT major in the real world (or meatspace if you prefer), currently going to college to earn a degree in Network Security. So when I play Shadowrun games I might dabble a bit as a mage, or toy with the idea of being a shaman, but when it comes right down to it... I'm a decker... which brings me to one of the biggest changes.\n\nDecking: Decking has been -completely- redone. Its not just 'you're doing the same thing as before, but in a computer now!' like it was in the previous two games. Here's bullet points with the changes:\n\n- Stealth matters! When you first jack into the matrix you aren't immediately going to be set upon by White and Black IC like you would before. Instead there's little security scanners floating around that you can sneak past. Even if they spot you they don't immediately attack, instead you start building up a meter called 'trace' as they try to track down where you're jacked in from. If you're good enough at decking you can take them out before the meter fills... but if it does then the security programs activate and you'd better have some ESPs and a decent deck because you're in for a fight then!\n\n- Blocking programs. To get to the ever-so-important nodes in the matrix you have to remove security walls. Now, if the trace has already gone out then this is fairly straightforward. You blast the things apart with your code and your programs as per usual. However, if you manage to sneak all the way up to them now you can, instead, hack the gates to remove them. You do this by basically playing Simon with the number pad on your keyboard. You get a few seconds (dependent on your Deck) to match the sequences of numbers in a security test pattern. Match several in a row and your deck will begin a brute force password hack against the system. A row of symbols will begin to spin above a series of other symbols, the password to get past the block. Use the remaining time on your hacking attempt to match up the correct patterns and the wall comes crashing down! Be careful however, get it wrong and you get a whole bunch of Trace dumped on you at once, perhaps even enough to get security protocols on your digital ♥♥♥!\n\n- New decks, new programs, new ESPs. Yep, its not the four standard decks anymore. There's new ones that do less damage and give you less max IP in exchange for an extended hacking time for the aforementioned blocking programs, for those confident in their stealth. At the same time you can go with ones that have more power but aren't as subtle if you just wanna break some IC. The new programs are useful too. There's programs that'll boost a decker's speed so they can dodge around security scanners, that'll slow down the timer on a hacking attempt, and more.\n\n- Graphic overhaul. I'm just gonna say it. The matrix looks GORGEOUS now. It really does look like the inside of a computer program. Your decker's avatar dashes through the 'air' rather than running, the IC and ESPs are all sleek and shiny, and it's a joy just to look at. Harebrained Schemes went all out with this one and gods bless them for it.\n\n\nSo, here's the TL;DR verison: If you liked Dragonfall and the original Shadowrun Returns then Hong Kong takes everything that was good about those and multiplies it to the nth degree.\n\nIf you never played those but are a fan of CRPGs or the old Shadowrun tabletop game, this is well worth your money. I've played eight hours and if I didn't have to go to bed now to get up for work in the morning I'd play another eight as soon as I post this.","August 21, 2015","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are bugs that will require reloading of save games (make multiple save games, by the way) and cause outright frustration.  Plus, the story seemed lackluster in comparison to the previous iteration.\n\nFirst off, the reloading bugs.  There are 2 that come to mind immediately.  In the beginning when you have to talk to your new contact, make sure you go to your shelter afterwards.  Do not save and quit, even though it is about 4 hours in and you need a break.  Doing so will cause the shelter to be inaccessible and the new contact to not do anything.  Thus, you will have to reload.  If you are like me, and only made one save, then prepare to play those 4 hours again.  The second majorly annoying bug is towards the end of the campaign.  Gather the four items before interfacing with the computer.  If you interface with the computer first, you'll have to reload and start the battle over again.  Also, even if you do this correctly, there is still a chance it will bug out and you'll have to reload.\n\nThe second deal-breaker is that the enemy AI has not improved since the last iteration.  If the main character is in LoS, they will gang up and kill it.  If the main character dies, then it is game over.  Sure, if you like playing the tough type (street samurai / something beefy), you will be fine.  I like playing a decker and was looking forward to the improvements to decking in this version.  However, since AI will hunt out the PC and deckers are not known for their ability to take a beating, it was pretty frustrating to try.\n\nNot really a dealbreaker, but worth a mention is that there are no graphical or combat improvements since the last iteration.  Character development is minimal.  There are very few skills which makes combat pretty repetitive.  After a few chapters, I found the 3 teammates that were most useful and never changed them around.  There was no need to.","January 3","false","28.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Along the way, the player meets new NPCs, gets info around the current predicament and trots around the hub to talk with people or buy items.\nThe game's heavy on dialogue, choices and repercussions, just like in the previous installments.\nIf you're a fan of Shadowrun, then this is quite an easy pickup. If not, I'd highly suggest to start with Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall.\n\nWhat I liked about the game is that it's story rich, much like the previous games. The atmosphere is great, the hub area is rather nice to explore. The NPCs are alright, the alternative storylines are alright... And that's sadly it.\n\nThere are several NPCs to choose from and have dialogue with. Sadly, aside from 2, they all fall under the 'meh, seen this character before' category. Aside from those 2, I personally didn't care much about their predicament.\nSure, some of it was like: Woah, what's going on... But it fell so flat on its ♥♥♥♥, because it later got the 'we've done it, yay' treatment.\n\nThe missions that the player can pick up are, for the most part, well done. Some turn into a complete nightmare, but unlike the previous installments, it's not as well worked out this time around.\nIt feels more 'safe' compared to the previous installments. There's only 2 missions where I was generally taken by how things turned out (only to be classified as 'yay, we done did it' in the end) which is a huge letdown.\n\nThe focus was probably more on the combat and hacking. The combat is amazing, hands down. It's fluid in nearly every way eventhough it feels a little easy.\nThe hacking is a lot faster and it feels more down to earth. Yet... Did we really need to get a memory game and then a sequence of markings?\n\nThe ending is lackluster. I saw it coming a mile away. Not because this is another installment of Shadowrun, but because the game didn't even try to mask it. I do like that there are several different options, but the general showdown felt weak.\n\nThe pacing of this game has to be the most horrible thing I've experienced in the last 2 years though.\nI felt myself becoming really bored after playing it for a while. You go on a mission which doesn't take 15 minutes, then hang around the hub area for an hour, reading arbitrary dialogues.\nThen there's the 'role playing' aspect. I'll compare this to Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 4, because this game does the exact same thing. Aside from some decisive factors, 80% of what you say/respond, doesn't even matter.\nThe big choices issue has even broken the game in 1 level, where you can't proceed if you didn't spend the right karma points.\n\nAnother reason I couldn't play the game in long runs, is, because it's a dialogue heavy game... With LOADS of typos in it. It doesn't just come down to a letter wrong here and there... There are whole sentences that aren't proper English. There are commas missing, misspelled words littering every conversation, as well as plain lazy writing.\nAs a big fan of Dragonfall, this is a major disapointment. I found myself not caring for some of the dialogue anymore, even when it sort of started to become interesting... (And then it usually dried out right after in most cases).\n\nAll in all, even if the review seems mostly negative, because this installment's a huge step down from the previous ones, this is still a pretty enjoyable game. The combat feels good and responsive, the atmosphere is great and it feels like a Shadowrun game. It just lacks what made the previous installments a great game.\n\nI'll not play it again for a while, unless, perhaps, the pacing gets improved and the numerous typos get fixed.\nI don't mind a typo here and there, but like I said, the game is riddled with it.\n\nOn that note though, the sound and music effects in the game are well done. Some even improved from the previous versions I might add. But I still wonder why my heavy pistol sounds like a dart gun.","December 22, 2015","true","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From that game I segued into the many of the Shadowrun novels, both new and old. Then, in 2007, a new Shadowrun video game was released, which turned out to be massively disappointing. Shortly after that, Shadowrun seemed to fall into troubled times. Fortunately, the magic that is Kickstarter allowed for a resurrection of Shadowrun to the video gaming world in the form of  Shadowrun Returns  in 2013. And then, not long after, we saw the release of   Shadowrun: Dragonfall , and now, here we are at  Shadowrun: Hong Kong . Since  Shadowrun Returns  each subsequent game has proven to be better than the last - Hong Kong is no exception.\n\nCertainly the best thing about the three newest entries into the Shadowrun video game universe has been their writing. From the plot to the dialogue - these have been exceptionally well written and realized games. Hong Kong has proven itself to be the finest of the three, with arguably the best pacing and deepest characters. The combat has seen another overhaul from the previous installment as well.\n\nThe combat in Returns was lackluster, and Dragonfall (particularly the Director's Cut) did much to improve upon this system. Now, in Hong Kong, with more weapons, cyber, spells, and an improved UI, combat is even more varied and fun. The amount of variety to the combat, and depth of your fellow shadowrunners, allows for plenty of experimentation and replayability. The visuals and soundtrack have also been improved upon.\n\nFrom  Shadowrun Returns  onward these games have been beautifully crafted in both their audio and visual design. Each subsequently more so than the last. Hong Kong manages to improve upon the art of the previous game, making the world seem more dense and filled with grim neo-noir neon. Meanwhile the soundtrack blends cyberpunk with Asian-inspired themes to create a sound fitting to the new game setting.\n\nOverall, Hong Kong is an improvement upon an already great gaming experience. Almost every facet of the game has seen improvement.  Shadowrun: Hong Kong  is a game I'd easily recommend to fans of the Shadowrun universe, roleplaying games, or the cyberpunk subgenre.","December 29, 2015","true","54.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Start with the earlier titles.\n\nHowever, if you've played & enjoyed the Shadowrun games thus far, Hong Kong is pretty good, but probably not as fun as Dragonfall. I think some of the writing in this one is the best so far, but I never felt challenged in combat (playing on Normal).\n\nPros: What I did enjoy were the deep dialog trees that you have to take the time to read and figure out how to lead the conversation. To get all of the special endings, the game really does expect you to take your time and talk to pretty much everyone in Heoi between runs. Remember to sleep!\n\nCons: I'm not in love with the real-time stealth mechanics in The Matrix. I was initially opposed to the hacking minigame, but once you understand it, it works pretty well.\n\nBugs: I did encounter several bugs (more annoying than game-killing) involving disappearing items and some choices on complicated missions.

The music is creative I found. I liked the ambience. The notes and themes were definetly different than the others. You get to see some specific cultural themes from this one, which really brings out the setting of the game. All in all - it seems to bring itself more into its own as a setting.  While Dragonfall and Returns were nice, you had to really know more about the social structures of the area to discern that you were in two different countries. You're a merc. You do stuff. You get money. You beat the bad guys. Corps are out to get you. Copy Pasta with some nice differences. In Hong Kong, the area is different. The background, the character images available,  the dialogue options and buildings reflect the setting, even some of the Matrix reflects their change in location. Spirits too are caught up in this - and reflect the area; which I thought was a particularly nice touch.\n\nThe cyberware system is a bit more friendly. You can finally go whole hog and upgrade your character to be Robocop. The bonus mechanics of basically purchasing more essence with exp is an option. This means that even mages/shamans/adepts with the inclination to do so, can get themselves some of the tuneups without feeling the pinch. In practice, I had an Elf Shaman who had  Kevlar Bone Lacing and Dermal Plating - with the final costs bringing my essence back down to 6. But that being said, I lost some of the versatility I could've otherwise used (like having access to mage spells instead of just shaman spells). Still - a nice customized choice. There are cyberware weapons - which any fan of the dice game can tell you there are a lot of those in the books. Its really nice to see them displayed. You get access to things like throwing grenades back (imagine that in Dragonfall), using powerful stun weapons, built in swords, and even a whip (which works for ranged characters - giving them a reason to go into it).\n\nThe NPC's are... very well fleshed out. Every so often you find the 'I'm a jerk because I'm a jerk' stereotype in a game. Some use it more often than not. This game however, is a bit more lenient on the action. Characters have reasons for their motivations. They have backstories and drives. Some dialogue options will recurr in future follow ups - and if you paid attention to the wording, you can change how events go. As with text based games - and a lot of RPG's, it can be a trial to wade through all the dialogue. Not gonna lie, I fast clicked some of these options when my interest was gone. Your character - in a lot of such situations - can also be fatigued by the conversation; and be rude, trying to end and get out of the talk as fast as possible.\n\nCombat is a bit nicer. Weapons still carry over the same as they did before. Your NPC companions have their own unique tasks that make you weigh whether or not you want them in the party based on what you were going up against. Some characters can outright knock out some enemies, while others make excellent tanks. Certain wombo combos are possible - fencing an enemy in with a barrier, then throwing an acid fog or a land mine at their feet; setting up the combat in your favor. You no longer have to necessarily rely on 'I need to hit'. Could just be 'you have to be in this general area'. Spells get ... amazingly modified by ley lines now. Where as before it was like 'this could be cool' - sometimes it more along the lines of "... I really do not want to step on this". A single spell meant to hit an enemy suddenly bounces three times, hitting your party member in the process! That being said, it brings a nice mechanic to the casting system.  The only gripe is that I had gotten used to having a medic on the team in Dragonfall; so always make sure you have multiple of the Doc Wagon kits!\n\nSince the last one I played before this was Dragonfall, I will use that by comparison. In Dragonfall, you had a set goal. You could see completion.  You had to manage your finances and/or your missions to be able to get what you needed. In Hong Kong, you can conceivably finish the main storyline with some of your runs holding out. There are quite a few.  The cash flow isn't as strong though - so if you plan on playing Street Samurai, be judicial. If you're thorough, you should be able to raise enough funds to accomplish most of your dreams. By contrast - on my second playthrough, I had so much left over I bought every flashbang I could carry and loaded up on meds and chems for the final mission - with about 2k in the bank.\n\nAnd finally... the Matrix. I've seen some people complaining about the Matrix use in this game. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. It was... more true to the setting in my mind. True it became a pain relying on NPC's kits to solve the issue, but hey - if you wanted your approach, you could play a decker! That being said, their are some memorization puzzles along with matching, stealth involved, and management of resources. Going into the Matrix becomes getting more nuyen, more gear, more consumables, and - more plot objectives. If the stealth is a problem, the option of going loud - like it was in most of Dragonfall, is always there. If you are unable to complete enough tasks or handle enough situations against the grain, you will go into the familiar Matrix Combat. So - its  a choice there.\n----\n\nTLDR:\nCons: Lots of talk. Can have problems with cash if you're not careful. Can miss important clues if not careful, which are not always logged in your mission journal.  Matrix mechanics can be challenging. Gear no longer gives stats (something to be aware of).\n\nPros: Fresh setting. Revamped cyberware mechanics. Renewed magic system. Can go through almost every mission with like three fights if careful (not counting matrix engagements).\n\nWould buy again. Would gift to a friend.","January 3","true","63.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A special mention to Gobbet who is a shaman,therefore awesome due to totemic upgrades and Racter who gets a pistol designed to buff drones.\n\nRecomendations:\n*The face vs fist dilema:normaly I would not tackle this dilema because it's the norm for all single player rpgs - to be forced to chose between a combat efficient character and a non combat efficient character. But because Shadowrun:Hong Kong has two main protagonists,namely the player and Duncan,could you please give us the opportunity to customize Duncan on top of our own guy so we have control over both the face and the fist we use in our campaing. I could even settle with the ideea that Carter could have survived in place of Duncan so we can have a proper mage npc for once.\n*Chi Casting:it feels too damn linear despite the fact that it has 2 simple components - mystical defense and melee damage via unique skills which take over a spell slot. I think chi casting could be made more dynamic by having player chose at set intervals what kind of chi casting spells they want to focus on learning and restrict their options based on those specializations (mystical defense and melee damage).\nSpirit Summoning/Spirit Control:pretty straight forward,provide little flavor - it's the ideeal place where you guys can integrate upgrades for the totemic abilities.","January 15","true","111.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, sometimes the writing intrudes on a good action sequence; when this happened I found myself skimming over the text quickly to get back crushing skulls, much to the detriment of the narrative.\n\nThe gameplay is rock solid, with abilities well balanced, giving a real sense of meaninful tactics and risk-reward mechanics. Many times I found myself gambling on a 50% one turn kill over a guaranteed two turn kill with less chance for harm to my party overall.\n\nThe story itself is another (rather trite) "end of the world boogeyman is coming to town, you are the chosen one, Neo" affair. Personally, I'm rather sick of these, they are predictable, worn-out, and not representative of general life in the Shadowrun universe. The story also makes the mistake of trying to force the player to care about a character through pure exposition. "This is your foster father, he's in some trouble, you should care because we tell you to." No, I'm sorry, I can't muster up a single care, there's no emotional connection there because the character I'm meant to care about is just a bit player whom I've never met.\n\nThe main benefit to this particular iteration of the shadowrun franchise will be what people are able to do with all the modding tools and all the new art assets. That said, at time of writing there are no major mods available in the workshop for Hong Kong. Give me a Shadowrun: Roguelike where I can just run the shadows until I retire or die please! Sprinkle on some minor story elements and you have game of the decade.\n\nIf you were a fan of the previous Shadowrun games, or you're a fan of solid tactical turn-based strategy then this game is worth picking up. If you're adverse to large amounts of reading, and sick of god-killer narratives then maybe skip over this one.","September 2, 2015","true","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They make the great game (Shadowrun: Dragonfire) even better. Interesting storyline, balanced battles, various endings. Best choise for RPG lovers.\nOnly thing that totally lame is IC hacking, and here's why: I can understand everything but... why numbers' rows (741, 851 and 963) have the same sound fot each row? Either it's the same sound for ALL numbers or unique for every. I can't help but using my ears and it lies to me cause one tone might mean 7, 4 or 1. So if it's 8 7 4 I'll press 8 7 7 since when I hear various tones I think: different notes. And now - two the same. Solution is to turn the sound off and that's the only available options for audials. Kind of stupid, don't you think?\nAs for the rest, it's supreme. The note about the tone was so that maybe developers hear the issue. It's really weird and brought me a lot of pain)","December 3, 2015","true","48.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All +1 and everything.\n\nHong Kong manages to do that as well, redefined some of your character choices - Armor now just gives armor, no more stat buffs, so it's down now to your cyberware to see enchanced stats which I like more. Stops making you more powerful than what you are. Adept got scaled to par as well, the mixing of Qi spells was pretty cool I thought, and there is a large selection of weapons available, which ultimately might lead to arbitrary choices but, it's still cool nonetheless.\n\nThe story, while fine, doesn't give me the closure I got from Returns and Shadowrun, I didn't feel satisfied where it ended, like there was still things to do but ultimately, you got denied.\nThough they went all out with the additional storylines - Everyone you talk to on the side has pages and pages of text... Though, sometimes, too much to make your head spin.\n\nThe Matrix got a complete revamp and damn, was it worth it. Jacking in never felt so good. Combat is still roughly the same but the espionage part of it is what makes it tick now.\n\nThe soundtrack in Dragonfall was awesome, and while Hong Kong's is good, it doesn't evoke any feelings you'd come to expect from running shadows. You need some heavy beats when you're out there in cyberland and whatnot, but HK just gives you more.. "Mellow" asian sounding tunes, more atmospheric vibes. If you take a listen to  the Deckcon song and Is0bel song, they're reminiscent of Du Heist and Calling All Runners in that the situations and how they're used is near the same as they were from Dragonfall - but they don't share near the same magnitude in pulse or vibe that Dragonfall had.\n\nAs a plus though, the combat music in the game is dynamic. As more bullets fly and more bodies fall, the songs'll get more intense. But it's still too hush hush to really care.\n\nAnd, was it just me, or  was the only damn combat song we ever kept hearing was Bad Qi? Seriously, it's everywhere.\n\n\n\ntl;dr It's a fine game, not my personal favorite out of the current three - It has the most refined structure of them, but it just feels lacking in other departments.\n\nIf you had to buy just one, well, it'd be this or Dragonfall, but in the end, it's your call.\nTwo spoons full of sugar, one's colored red, and one's blue.","December 2, 2015","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shadowrun:Hong Kong takes place in a futuristic rendition of its namesake, where technology and magic co-exist alongside with several fantasy sub-human races.\n\n\nThis is a very narrative-driven RPG. The camera is locked in an isometric view with 3d characters running around in a mostly static 2D environment. The graphics are beautiful and lovingly crafted, while the excellent asian-themed musical scores set the mood for your 20~30-hour trek through Hong Kong. In all,  Hong Kong is a fascinating setting for a cyberpunk adventure.\n\n\nGeneral gameplay flow have you undertaking various tasks in Hong Kong while at the same time making progress on the main storyline. After every mission you will return to your base of operations, where you can purchase new equipment, talk to NPCs or check your computer for new missions. Talking to your party members after every mission will allow you to gain new insights into their personality and background, and eventually you'll be able to embark on their own personal quests.\n\n\nProgression is made by mostly clicking on static icons which hover above static NPCS or objects of interest, which I can't help but feel is a missed opportunity. NPCS walking around would've made the beautiful but static environment seem more alive. The missions themselves are very well crafted. There are often multiple solutions to the same problem(although some of them are limited by your team composition and skills), highly increasing replayability and the sense that you're a true Shadowrunner, able to complete the missions in the way you see fitting. Combat is the same as the previous two games, which is a turn-based tactical affair not unlike x-com. There're a variety of skills and weapons at your disposal, understanding your team and making use of cover is key to winning the battles. The matrix system had been revamped from the previous two games. While the idea is good, the game's movement system isn't really suited for the stealth-based parts in the matrix(imagine trying to play Metal Gear with RTS controls) and the actual hacking itself could get repetitive after a few tries.\n\n\nThe true star of the game, however, is its writing. Very few RPGs can write at the level that Shadowrun:Hong Kong does and the writers had truly done a phenomenal job. There are sometimes so much dialogue between missions it felt like it slows down the pacing, but they're all very well written and if you love reading, you're in a for a treat.\n\n\nShadowrun:Hong Kong knows which audience it is catering to, and fans of the first two games are very likely to enjoy this one.\n\n\nPros:\n+Writing is top-notch\n+Hong Kong is an interesting setting\n+Beautiful aesthetics\n+Excellent music\n+Memorable characters\n+Strategic combat\n\nCons:\n-Some overlooked bugs need to be fixed\n-Some solutions are tied to skills rather than real decision-making\n-Not much interactivity with the environment\n-Movement system is not quite suited for stealth sections","September 2, 2015","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hong Kong refines many of the elements present in Dragonfall. For example, there is a new stealth oriented matrix (still some combat involved) and more non-lethal options on missions.\n\nSome pros:\n- great dialogue especially with the Rachter and Gaichu companions\n- combat is the same fun system as Dragonfall with a few tweaks\n- more choices on how to complete missions\n- some of the etiquettes are very useful (I hear others are almost useless - so a bit of a pro and con here)\n\nSome cons:\n- money is very rare, it is very difficult to completely kit out your own character (or any others). This is especially true if you play a decker like me and you want to buy guns, a deck, programs and cyberware.\n- the game isn't as difficult as Dragonfall. I'm better at the game now, but it was much easier than Dragonfall. I didn't come close to dieing once (on hard) and rarely had to heal\n- it seemed like the AI often made some questionable decisions, hopefully they will smarten it up through future patches\n\nIf you enjoyed Dragonfall, you will enjoy this.

That's the one big issue I have with all the Shadowrun games right now, because the campaigns as they are are about as rock-solid as you're expecting from this sort of game.\n\nThe story is rich in characters- and places- background information, and there is a whole lot to do. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe decker overhaul made me cringe at first until I got the hang of the new approach to cyberspace, but it works well in my eyes and makes you think twice before jumping into a system.\n\nAgain, as with the other games, this game's only flaw is that the main campaign is too short. Having made this into a third game forces community creators to take their creations from Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun Dragonfall and port it over, leaving those other two games with abandoned or broken content. This could have really been done better.\n\nHere's to hoping the next Shadowrun game combines the previous three campaigns under one banner and releases more official campaigns as DLC, allowing community creators to use content from new DLC in their workshop builds without having to port to yet another game with changed GUI.","September 29, 2015","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not so much combat that you get sick of it, or that it feels like you're playing an MMO.\n\nCONS:\n- Sort of easy. Most of the way through on Hard difficulty, and I've only had to revive one teammate. Some climactic battles end up pretty disappointing. And I'm not playing a power-build character.

Tons of combat options compared to the original, some more enjoyable less cliche characters as part of the cast, and enough variety to play it a couple times over, or if your like me continually restart it with Inspirations for new characters.\n\nThey even removed the strange stat giving armors from Dragonfall, allowing you play looking how you want and upgrade in a  tier fashion when you have money, instead of just the next best armor set for your class.\n\nThe only cons I can think of being a fan of Shadowrun is I wish there were more, that and the obligatory decker problem when you tell a shadowrun story like this. You either have to play a decker or a decking capable, or bring the story provided decker on every single last mission even if you hate their guts(Blitz) or find them a pale wallflower(Is0bel) just in case you come across a computer or a safe in a run that was supposed to be nothing but a firefight.

I especially like they don't start over for every campaign but build upon the last one and keep improving and improving it. This time, the hacking has improved tremendously\n\nThe turnbased combat is my favourite kind of combat. Think X-Com and Jagged Alliance. However the game isn't just combat. It's a full-blood RPG, with tons of story, dialogue and a lot of different ways of getting to the end of your quest. I also really like the Shadowrun steampunk world. I'm so tired of the standard fantasy setting in so many RPG's, so I really love the RPG. Even though I'm an asia freak I think the german theme in Dragonfall might have been just a tad more to my liking.\n\nIt's not for everyone though, you have to enjoy reading and getting into the story... but if you like story and turn based combat you really can't go wrong for the amount of money it costs.","October 18, 2015","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a dark setting where you are opperating in shades of grey at best. It is set in a world where magic meets technology. They creators showed a good understanding of hong kong, better than just a quick google search. If you have been to the city, you will have a familiar feeling with this game.\n\nIt is a story heavy game, so be prepared to read a lot of dialogue. If you want to skip to the action this may not be the game for you. If you want a rich story with deep characters, though, this is likely to fit the bill. The NPCs are fleshed out and believable with their own story arks. You have a number of options to define your character as well.\n\nGame play wise, it is a fairly tactical game. Be prepared to look for cover and plan your moves carefully. Combat can be slow, especially if you play it like a game of chess. However, it gives you a great deal of options. The matrix section can depend a bit on your tastes. If you like stepping away from combat to solve puzzles you will probably enjoy them more. For the most part, though, the matrix is skippable if you don't want to bother with it.\n\nYour actions will have consequences in the game. Some more long term than others. You can choose to fight or talk your way through many situations. Who you let live or ally with can impact the story later on. While I would have liked to have seen more hard moral choices, over all the options presented seem believable and organic.","October 13, 2015","true","119.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Talking to my fixers and vendors about their stories.  Selling information I learn about people on my missions.  Not to mention on the missions there is NO instruction that hey if you talk to this guy and say the right thing he just might hook you up with a sweet ♥♥♥ weapon to give you a data stick you can sell on the net for LOTS of nyuen($).  Its a dream come true for anyone who likes to be immersed in your game.\n\nOnto the next aspect theres a whole class known as "Deckers" hackers essentially and you can be armed to the teeth and cybernetically enchanced but theres a whole other game world once you jack into the MANY random terminals and computers you find throughout the game.  You navigate through them with an avatar battling firewalls and even other deckers for valuable information or to conduct espinoge on vast scales or simple to let your team in the side door so you go unnoticed.

Now of course, you don't have to divulge into the lore. There's options to prod more into a conversation, which I did. I'd say at least half of my gameplay is reading.

They have similarities, and many of the mechanics are the same, but they are not the same game both in feel and in gameplay.\n\nI really liked the amount of dialogue you get from the NPCs. It is clear as you talk to these characters that there was a lot of writing that had to be done. I'd say that for each major NPC (the party, the townsfolk, etc.) there is at least 2-3 hours of dialogue available. Not only that, but the options and conversation was much more advanced and flowed much more realistically than Dragonfall. In prequels, you would bombard NPCs with dialogue options until you exhausted all they could tell you; in Hong Kong, NPCs will remember what you tell them and conversation will follow a life-like pattern.\n\nThe companions are really amazing in Shadowrun: Hong Kong as well. They all have an interesting and developed backstory, and their behavior ties into the setting of the Sixth World. The only one I didn't quite like was Is0bel, as I found her behavior childish and she was abnormally quite. Then again, this was what she was supposed to be, if you look at her backstory.","September 30, 2015","true","30.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's the one big issue I have with all the Shadowrun games right now, because the campaigns as they are are about as rock-solid as you're expecting from this sort of game.\n\nThe story is rich in characters- and places- background information, and there is a whole lot to do. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe decker overhaul made me cringe at first until I got the hang of the new approach to cyberspace, but it works well in my eyes and makes you think twice before jumping into a system.\n\nAgain, as with the other games, this game's only flaw is that the main campaign is too short. Having made this into a third game forces community creators to take their creations from Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun Dragonfall and port it over, leaving those other two games with abandoned or broken content. This could have really been done better.\n\nHere's to hoping the next Shadowrun game combines the previous three campaigns under one banner and releases more official campaigns as DLC, allowing community creators to use content from new DLC in their workshop builds without having to port to yet another game with changed GUI.","September 29, 2015","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a fan of the lore and don't hate cRPGs, then this is money well spent. If you liked the first two games, then this is money well spent.\nAfter my first playthrough I can say, that the game entertained me greatly all the way through, even though the story was kind of predictable after some point. Nonetheless engaging and the writing is excellent. So overall I love most about everything about this game, but there are some minor nitpicks.\nPlease bear in mind that I played on hard, if you're playing it on a lower difficulty your experience may vary.\n\nThe MatrixThe matrix got an overhaul. Even though I was one of the few that liked the matrix in the old games, I still think this is an improvement. However, there are some things that might put people off. Note that I have not yet played a PC decker, the experience may therefore vary.\nMovement in stealth sections is way to imprecise\nisometric view can obscure important details in stealth sections.\nNo access to programs in stealth sections.\nNo possibility to get into combat-mode without getting caught first.\nThe Blocker-IC minigame can become kind of irritating after a while.\nIs0bels matrix accuracy is way to low...\nThe DifficultyIt is way to easy. I played on hard and finished the game as a Face (max. Charisma, all etiquettes) with some cyberware and some rifle-skill in about 27 hours. There wer only very few parts of the game where I felt actually challenged. And I am someone who seldom finnishes a game, even less so on the hardest possibility. The most bothersome thing was the grenade-love of NPCs, and you can get past that quite easily with a nice little cyberarm. The only thing, that was remotely challenging was the matrix and that is most likely only because I had to use Is0bel, who is only okay at matrix combat.\nI have now started another playthrough, where I changed to normal difficulty, just to check things out and because I wanted to build an even less optimized character (burn-out adept-cyberweapon-shaman-grenade girl). It is ridiculously easy...\n\nThe Loading TimeLoading times are long. Really long, and tehy got progressively worse. I had up to 30 seconds of black space before a loading screen even appeared. And when you're reloading your quicksave over and over again, because Is0bel screwed up in the matrix, but you want to get it just perfect, then you're going to wait. A lot. I think I can attribute at least one hour of my playtime, only to loading screens.\n\nThe Small StuffOne nitpick of mine is the fact, that when you start up a drone, the controlls automatically switch to the drone. I can't even remember how often I have tried to relocate Racter after activating Koshei and relocating Koshei instead. But that was also the problem in the previous games, so that's old news.\n\nThe Good StuffWell, I already said, that I actually love most all of this game, but there are some things that stand out.\nThe writing. It's good. It's real good. At least on the same level as in Dragonfall. I can't really decide which one I like more.\nThe ability to engage combat-mode before the enemy sees you. Glorious, wouldn't want to miss that anymore.\nThe stealthy matrix. It might have problems in the execution, but the overall feel is just right.","August 23, 2015","true","40.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some very minor differences to how combat plays out have been put in place (I personally noticed only one or two and neither are bad) but ultimately it all functions very well.\n\nBy the end of the game, there were no loose ends leaving me feeling as though the story was incomplete. Everything felt nice and tidy.\n\nThe only reason I have not given a 10 is because Dragonfall was easily a 10 to me and the story, as I said, is not as "on the edge of your seat" as its predecessor. I'll be playing it through again regardless, as it has as much replayability as one could hope for.","August 23, 2015","true","29.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buggy at times, SR:HK recreates the tabletop experience with a plot that loses coherence and drive somewhere in the middle before whipping everything back together for the finale like an actual game master would have happen - complete with a literal deus ex machina as an end boss.\n\nThe maps are much larger, but most of it is empty space populated with nice atmospheric setpieces.  Nice scenery does kind of wear thin after a while when you're criss-crossing the hub area to buy things or advance the little subplots the NPCs have.\n\nThe new Matrix gameplay emphasizes sneaking around and playing Simon/a memory game.  It was novel, but wore that novelty out quickly.\n\nDespite it all, would still recommend the game if only for one run through.  The story is nice and all the little details and in-jokes are appreciated.  Replayability is something I'm on the fence about - there's parts of this game's combat and Matrix mechanics that are simply a slog and the different avenues of conversation/story really just determine how much of a jerk you are to random people in Hong Kong/your team exemplified best in the end-of-game dialogue with the end boss.  In short, replayability doesn't look good to me on the effort/payoff scale.\n\nAlso kind of salty that there's a Hong Kong game and you can't dual-wield pistols I mean seriously now this is a terrible oversight.","August 23, 2015","true","41.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well.. It's an RPG above all else, the gameplay is nothing special, it's not boring but it could use some work too, this is a game you play for the story and atmosphere. It is no secret that there's a severe lacking of modern cyberpunk games and this game certainly delivers on that and gives you a very interesting dystopian future setting with a twist, it has elfs, dwarfs, orcs, mythical creatures and magic but in a modern/futuristic society.\n\nFrom what I have gathered the Shadowrun Returns series (based on the PnP Shadowrun setting) tends to be a hit or miss with people, as a roleplayer and video game story enthusiast I personally love it! If you care more about story than gameplay elements I would recommend it to you as well.\n\nAs for Hong Kong specifically, I haven't finished it yet but I have put in 10 houres or so around the time im writing this review, I would say it rates somewhere in between the other two games.. The first Shadowrun: Returns game, well, it's no secret it was lacking and kind of short, I personally still loved it due to the setting and as an old Inphinity Engine games fan I get my hand on every similar style RPG I can find, you just can't match the roleplaying and immersion you get out of these type of games anywhere else. I am getting a little off track.. The sequal Dragonfall picked up ALOT of slack and was just purely an amazing ride, Hong Kong seems to be somewhere in between, definetely more polished than the original but so far lacking a bit of Oomph, keep in mind though this opinion is formed only 10 houres into the game, and there has been some interesting moments, this opinion might change by the time I have experienced more of the main story. One thing that I am confident will not change however is this; I recommend any RPG fan to play this game, if you are new to the series I would recommend playing the other installments first since there's really no visible technological upgrades between the sequals, only the story differs. At the very least do yourself a favor and pick up Dragonfall, the original might give you a sour first impression, I would still recommend getting it as long as you dont allow it to turn you off the sequals (they are better, much like how Baldurs Gate 2 was better than 1 but both were good).","August 24, 2015","true","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not a lot of innovations but some are still to be noted : the new matrix is pretty cool and the models used for trolls and orks are refreshing, glad they reworked the bulky ones of the previous games. It sure can feel like an overpriced dlc for people who aren't into it enough (not my case thought, i see shadowrun, i click like, i'm a simple man) because of the same game engine being used again, but the story is appreciable and so does the ambience. They worked a bit on the HUD too and the textures seems a bit sharper (perhaps just an impression). Characters are engaging and the plot unfolds at a nice pace. Difficulty isn't challenging enough in my opinion thought.\n\nJust finished it, the end felt a bit rushed but the plot was enjoyable overall. Finally, the shadowrunners backgrounds were globally interessant despite Duncan being annoying.\n\nI think it's important to support the devs from Harebrained Schemes, they're doing a really decent job so far. I hope their next project will be more ambitious thought, since they raised quite the funding for this one it could encourage them to do so.","August 21, 2015","true","38.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would only recommend this game for the serious fans who care more about the story than the gameplay.\n\nThe addition of stylized "cut-scenes" with voice acting, and the visual overhaul of the matrix are welcome improvements.  However, there are far more glitches in the actual gameplay than in the previous games.  The UI and movement are cumbersome at the best of times; reloading a quicksave is sometimes necessary during normal gameplay becuase of glitches.  The most common glitches I encountered were being unable to click on objects in the environment (such as terminals) and the game freezing during combat.  "Misclicking" is still a big problem during combat when multiple actors are close together.\n\nThe redeeming quality of this game is the story, which is quite good and keeps me playing long after I would have otherwise quit in frustration.  The numerous choices in dialogues adds to immersion, as do the many choices and their consequences.  Unfortunately, one of the glitches in this game involve dialogue scripts breaking, which requires reverting to an older save.\n\nAlso, the matrix overhaul is terribly implemented.  The decking sequences are tedious and full of glitches.  The "real-time" movement in the matrix exacerbates the flaws/glitches in the "real-time" movement system.  The matrix is practically unplayable even after all of the patches they've released.  These glitchy "real-time" sequences don't belong in a turn-based tactical game.\n\nI do not recommend buying Shadowrun: Hong Kong unless you are a fan of the series and you don't mind the major gameplay flaws.","April 18","false","91.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You don't become heroes who save the world, you're literally a cog in the machine. Even if you do something amazing all you'll become is just a bigger cog in the machine that is the Seventh World.\n\nWelcome to Life, Chummer. Let's do this Batman style, the Good, the Bad and the Bold.\n\nThe Good:\n- The customization and Karma system has been pretty balanced, honestly. In Dragonfall, it was a bit too harsh with the Karma, making dual-builds almost half-impossible because of how unbalanced reliance to some skills were. It wasn't as good as Dead Mans Switch when it first came out, but the customization was pretty good.\n- The character balance is good, a shaman, a decker and a Street Samurai with a Rigger and another Samurai. Each class has their own good sides and the advantages are more defined compared to Dragonfall.\n- Great writing. Holy ♥♥♥♥, did they work their butts off for the setting. The boat town looks amazing, the music is atmospheric and the dialogue carry so much impression. (Especially Kindly Cheng, my favorite character out of them all)\n- Running Gags. In a game. THAT WORKS. Did I mention the writing is great?!\n- Better defined character traits, AKA pacifist runs are (somewhat) possible. At least, you can get far for being a pacifist. And there's bad and good consequences to good and bad choices, AKA you aren't punished for doing bad things and rewarded for doing good things 24/7. AKA a morality system done right.\n\nCon:\n- The story. Getting the true story was VERY cryptic. You need to talk with one of your vendors every mission, you need to talk with one of your teammates every mission. And you need to memorize one phrase from a conversation in your head until an event near the end of the game. Did I mention it was cryptic? You need to also talk with another team member constantly also.\n- The characters, it felt like two were getting too much attention compared to some others. I liked how dragonfall dealt with teammates, but there needs to be more content on each characters.\n- Some problems involving items. It feels like some glitches are here still, but it's workable around. Not excusable for not having some bugs fixed (AKA weapons I give to teammates disappear forever after a mission or unable to give items to teammates).\n\nThe Bold: (AKA my opinion)\n- Brings me up to the next one: These games feel too short. A huge game for $60 with about 4 times as much missions in an Shadowrun game would make me so happy. An expansion and even maybe multiple hideouts or fronts to operate in. Something like Invisible Inc. except for Shadowrunners and operating against the law.","March 20","true","38.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So let's start with the good:\n\nImproved Matrix: That's right runners! The Matrix is graphically updated, more challenging, and now includes hacking mini games!\n\nImproved Combat: The biggest upgrade for me is that a rigger doesn't need a deck anymore, meaing you can carry a gun and 2 drones with you into battle if you've invested the Karma. That's like having two extra members to the team, plus being able to defend yourself properly. *Very* nice change, and makes riggers even more viable than previously.\n\nImproved Mission Prep and Inventory Management: This was a HUGE improvement. Now swapping gear and items between compansions and party guests is much, much easier with newly designed mission screens, which include tabs for gear, spells, and items. You can see in a glance everyone's loadouts at once and drag and drop items from your stash to the appropriate party. Also, if you find an item in the field and you have space in your characters slots, you can take the item immediately, and either hang onto it or hand it immediately to another party member! That's a big improvement for harder modes when you may be running low on supplies and won't be able to access a stash!\n\nGreat Characters: The companion missions are back, and the companions this time around aren't nearly as stereotypical as they were in Dragonfall. Gone are the goth chick, angry chick, and drunk german, (whom I liked, but thought they were severely stereotyped), and now you have a cast that includes an adopted brother, rat shaman millenial, samurai ghoul, and more!\n\nEngrossing Story/Cutscenes: They're sparsely used, but worth noting since the previous games didn't include cutscenes. The storyline this time around runs much like Dragonfall, so you'll get hooked early in, but have a lot of time to run other missions till the main storyline picks back up. Once it does though, you're in it to win it.\n\nNew Cyberware and Essence Cap: For me, this was HUGE. You have access to really great cyberware from early on in the game, including some really cool weapons, (laser whips, anyone?!) The essence cap can be increased to 8, (Up from 6 in previous games), meaning that you can judiciously load out a character. There's even a new branch of Karma that expands on your cyber effectiveness.\n\nNew Weapons: Flaming and Electric swords, Cyber Claws, and armor stripping shotguns. Oh my!\n\nBetter Companion Abilities: The Companion Level Upgrade system is back from Dragonfall: Director's Cut, except now I found the abilities to be downright amazing. For instance, both your samurai ghoul and your shaman can develop abilities that one-shot opponents who meet particular conditions. Having the right party member and planning ahead with their tree can make some fights incredibly rewarding when your forethought pays out in big nuyen.\n\nOn the downsides: The story takes a big detour for a good chunk of the game if you're a completionist who like side missions and companion missions. Also, there's not a lot of Nuyen (Cash) to be had in the game in comparison to Dragonfall, so some very judicious spending is in order.\n\n\nIf you've never played either of the first two games, I have good news. This is basically a standalone game, so you can just pick up and play, and learn as you go. It's a thought provoking RPG where strategy, cover, and character building are the key to having a great time. Also, if you're into cyberpunk, this game is for you!","August 24, 2015","true","76.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shadowrun: Hong Kong delivers another great story as well as some minor, but nice improvements.\n\nLike in Dragonfall you get a detailed backstory for each of your crew members and talking to them leads to optional missions, which help develop the characters and are good for a change of pace when compared to the other side missions.\nOnly a few of the side missions have to be completed in order to complete the campaign, but you're really selling yourself short if you don't do all of them and miss out on interesting sideplots.\n\nPersonally I like the changes this iteration brings to the matrix and while the minigames can get repetitive, it is a huge step up from the old matrix system, which was a bit of a weakpoint previously.\n\nWhile other reviews talk about a lot of bugs, I only spotted minor ones usually related to one obscure branch of some sideplot - a side effect when there are tons of different branches to keep track of and many of the choices have some\nminor effect you discover only later on.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in the Shadowrun universe, or just a good mix of story and strategy.\nIf you are only looking for a strategy game, but don't really care about the setting or reading lots of dialog, you probably shouldn't buy this game. The strategy layer is not refined enough to carry the game on its own.","August 24, 2015","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As I haven’t played the table-top / P&P Shadowrun, I can only speak to the game itself. (TL;DR: Skip to last sentence)\n\nThe Shadowrun Returns series have brought me back to enjoying overhead sprite based games. Since the early Fallout games, I’ve never found RPGs with this style to be particularly engaging.\nAs the latest iteration of the Shadowrun Returns games, Hong Kong provides a lot of polish and features that were missing while improving upon the foundation that was already pruned from the previous two games. This is not to say it is perfect, but I’ll touch on that in a bit.\n\nThe characters you run with are quite interesting. I’d say that they kept a lot of the improvements from Returns to Dragonfall in this new game. How do these characters compete with Dragonfall’s? The conclusion I come to here is that your perception of this depends upon your personality. I’d say it was an improvement (especially since there are more character to get to know), but perhaps some may find them slightly less engaging than before.\n\nNew skills have been added that, I felt, increased the immersion. They allowed for greater specialization and seem to level the field for greater viability between classes. On that note, cyberware as a whole has seen a massive facelift which made me very excited.\n\nThe matrix has been revamped and personally, I love it. I have heard the complaints concerning the difficulty of some tasks within the matrix, but I found the difficulty refreshing and overcoming it equally satisfying. It is worth mentioning that it doesn’t seem to be common knowledge that you can skip pieces of these puzzles by hitting the “next” button. While it increases the challenge of the following section, I usually found that final section easier than the rest of the “memory test” combined.\n\nThe story and atmosphere are, once again, to die for. For me, this is the real appeal of these games and Hong Kong is absolutely no exception. If magic seems a stretch in a cyberpunk universe, I promise, these games make it feel right at home in the dark, seedy, grimy world of dystopian cyberpunk. Further, I would strongly assert that the addition of magic adds significantly to the universe. Its addition makes the universe feel that much more uncontrollable (yet very tightly controlled), dark, and dangerous.\n\nI won’t try to tell you that the game is flawless. There are certainly bugs and problems--I haven’t experienced nearly as many as some and I beat the game before the first major patch was announced so I don’t believe they are as prolific as some claim--but many of these have been patched out.\n*Edit: On my second playthrough, I have noticed quite a few more bugs. Most of them have no effect on gameplay.\n\nThe biggest complaint I can offer you (which is a meagre gripe in comparison to the game’s merits) is that it is text based instead of being voice acted. For its predecessors, I didn’t see this as a flaw in the slightest because the dialogue was either minimal or very engaging. In this game, while the dialogue retains its very interesting dialogue, there is simply so much of it that I sometimes found it difficult to want to speak to many of the NPCs and simply gave priority to the ones who I found interesting. As a counter to my own complain though, I do like that I didn’t spend all my time talking to every single NPC in the small little village of a home as that felt closer to real life. So, ultimately, I’m conflicted on the matter.\n*Edit: Aside from this, the loading times are quite sad. I moved the game from my secondary hard-drive to my SSDs and it's still an issue. This is really the only thing about the game that I find unnacceptable.\n\nIn the end, I can say this: if you liked the original Fallout games, if you like cyberpunk themed stories or games, or if you like RPGs, you really ought to pick these games up. I’d be a bit surprised if you didn’t enjoy them.","August 22, 2015","true","80.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The 'Asian' themes just didn't resonate with me anywhere near as well as the European/German setting.\nA few bugs, characters I hadn't recuited (and in one case had killed) appeared in my list of available runners, but that's easily ignored.\nThe more save files I had caused the reload times to chug horrendously (taking upwards of a minute), so about 2/3rds through I deleted all the old ones which seemed to help considerably.\nHowever long still reload times made the new matrix 'stealth' sections painful - oops caught, reload, oops caught, reload etc, after 10+mins in a single area the immersion was truely broken.  While perhaps that's my fault for being an habitual save-scummer, it's still a flaw of the game.\n\nI feel like I need to play this through this again as I'm certain I missed a lot. Follower story missions for instance... odd to miss them somehow considering how much I constantly harassed my companions after every mission.\nBut at the same time the thought of going through that near-mandatory matrix again stuff just puts me off, even though I play it on easy/story mode.\n\nDespite my gripes it's a good game if a bit unpolished.

You've been asked to go there by your foster father.\n\nThere are three battles before you even become a shadowrunner; one of them is avoidable, but yeah, there's a high probability of being killed first time out. There's even a Steam achievement for it.\n\nThe Shadowrun games involve a lot of reading. The writers seem to be more novelists than screenwriters, so they're really not concerned with anything seeming too much like a monologue. The balance between reading and playing is good, though. The reading lets you take a break from trying to shoot, fight, or magic your way out of the many encounters. Talking to your group is also encouraged, as some of them will give you missions. Some of the side characters you'll meet along the way will also help you in surprising ways.\n\nIn addition to the character quests, there are many hidden little things in the game that can be easily missed if you don't look around. There are other runners you can meet, more goodies to buy if you have the cash, and some entertaining characters.\n\nThere's also a heavier necessity for a decker, which seems to be why the decking virtual world has been given a major upgrade since the last game. It looks much better, and has a few more challenges to it. There are times in the game when a decker is absolutely necessary, and other times when a decker can help to avoid a battle, or even save everyone's lives.\n\nUltimately, though, the Shadowrun gameplay experience is looking very dated, especially after XCOM, and the upcoming XCOM2. Ideally, for the next Shadowrun game, I'd like to see more 3D, a rotatable map, and a lot more voice acting. Harebrained Schemes have improved their storytelling immensely since Shawrun Returns, but now it's time for them to improve the gameplay experience with some new technologies.","August 26, 2015","true","38.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some new mechanics, and the game looks better, both of which are nice, but the writing isn't quite up to par with Dragonfall, which is definitely disappointing.\n\nI suppose that about sums it up, actually.\nI'm not angry or upset, just slightly disappointed.\n\nHowever, Hong Kong still gets my recommendation.\nIt's a solid RPG with a lot of freedom to play how you want to, presented in a vibrant, beautiful setting, with a decent story behind it. The qualms I have with the writing are most likely present because the writing in Dragonfall spoiled me and set my expectations a little high.\n\nSo, make no mistake:\nThis is a good game.","August 31, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the rich dialogues with people. It's like mass effect where after I do something, I run around to talk to people to see what they say next. I especially love being able to fast talk my way through as much fighting as possible. Some levels I was able to just talk my way through completely while others I am able to bypass massive droves of enemies by being able to just sell them some believeable lie that lets me just walk right on past.\n\nThe bonus campagn was kinda meh tho. It felt like they rushed most of it as it lacked a lot of the character dimension the primary campagn had. That and the final boss was just droves of bullet sponge enemies if you didn't do the thing to take control of some of the heavies.","April 4","true","35.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is top notch.  It really captures the feel of a tabletop RPG.  The other Shadowrun games have been fantastic, but somehow they managed to improve on something I thought was flawless.\n\nWhat really impresses me about the depth of this story is that even all the vendors have their own backstories.  The addition of cyber-affinity is another fantastic element.  You even get the ability to make choices on how your party levels up.","March 12","true","110.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really, really enjoyed playing it. Except for decking. Is0bel, the NPC decker just can't cut it at the end. I'm decent at avoiding the hellish spotlights as they track me moving through the matrix, (which is really. really not fun) but a dozen reloads later and difficulty scaled down to easy, I am stuck on a critical, late story mission. I managed to beat the previous games without having to load up on decking programs and goodies. This just feels like a really awful part of the game. You can avoid decking in a lot of situations, but, without spoilers, the tower near the end of the game is decker hell.\n\nI love the shaman and street sam/adept npcs. I'm cool with the gun bunny. The drone guy is okay. The decker is great with grenades, but, when it comes to using her for decking, either A: Buy her a bunch of programs instead of buying things to improve your player character or B: Make a decker yourself and never use her.\n\nThe changes made to decking did change it and make it a new experience. If you like playing hide-from-fast-moving-spotlights and bop-it with-number-sequences to then match vaguely alien looking symbols to open up nodes, please, do so!\n\nI made it through 75% of the game, playing on normal, before it became impossible for me to beat a story mission because of decking. I'm not the only person who had this issue. A few searches and some google fu did not avail me. I reloaded for hours and I still can't beat the mission.","February 20","false","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought and played every shadowrun from Harebrained and it has to be said that while the gameplay is samey they get that much better with every game with the simple things. Things like UI, and sidegames like the matrix get the love they need. The dialogue as always is plentiful and the characters hook you in with their backgrounds and personalities. The game is a lot more structured and rigid than the messy slum cyberpunk setting but that is fine as it improves the pacing. The one thing I hope for in the next shadowrun project they make is - verticality - in the level design. It seems a bit flat atm the moment and bringing climbable high-grounds in the battle zones will make the combat and explorable areas more interesting.

The matrix is a lot more interesting. I loved the updates to character creation and development. I actually played through the campaign a second time, after seeing all the melee weapon options and wanting to rebuild my character to use the enchanted swords. I kind of wish I wanted to go through a third time, so I could build a mega-cybered character...but all the dialogue and story would be way too tedious after going through it twice already. It's unfortunate that the replay value is so limited. It'd be fun to explore more character types, if it didn't mean slogging through all the minutiae every time.\n\nShadows of Hong Kong is not amazing. I was looking forward to getting more karma and pushing my character's abilities farther... but the fights are SO dull. It's basically just waves of heavily armored enemies with giant HP pools. The last fight in the Detention job got so boring, with wave after wave of enemies continuing to appear, that I don't even care about the end of the story. It's like they built the expansion and forgot how to create interesting challenges. Piles of enemies are not fun.\n\nOn the bright side, Shadows of Hong Kong is just a small bonus part of the game. The main game is totally worth the time.","March 12","true","96.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are to lore, world building and dialogue this may very well be the best game in the series.\n\nDialogue and world building aside combat is much the same as in earlier SR games, at least if you play a decker, but the Matrix was revamped. I felt changes refreshing even I didn't bothered much with the hacking puzzles. Free roaming (unless you are detected) in matrix melds very well with turn based combat in meat space.\n\nOverall I recommend this to anyone who likes earlier games in the series and in general who is to cyberpunk.\n\n","March 17","true","58.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
