Graphics could have been better, but it is an old-ish game, and they're not so bad, that you don't wanna play it.\nIt's simple and comes with small games in the actual game. There's a bit of humor as we know it from the movies.\n\nOne of the reviews states, that it is not playable on 64 bit, but I have no problem, so that has probably been fixed.","October 3, 2015","true","4.1"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

So hope you don't mind graphics from PS1 level. Or corridor level design that would have embarrassed a ZX Spectrum.\n\nIt's an entirely average generic licensed videogame. Zero inspiration. Repetitive gameplay, but for all that you might get some fun out of the story and voice acting. There's nothing staggeringly wrong here, it's just made no attempt to be anything other than generic hack n slash starring CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW.\n\nAnd let's face it, that's why we're all here isn't it. CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW in generic hack n slash. That's worth a dollar. Maybe 2.","September 29, 2015","true","4.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","12","16","4","0"

I can't get the game to play beyond the break out of prison or find additional instructions. It's a mystery to me as to why Disney would allow such a travisty on the trusting public or Steam not to have encountered other complaints. I'm not sure I'll ever buy any more games.","October 15, 2014","false","0.7"," 69 of 148 people (47%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","47","69","148","9","0"

Please make this easier, also, you put in people with cannons as arms, they weren't even in the movie, this also ruins the game by makeing in insanely hard.","April 18","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
