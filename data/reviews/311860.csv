I've recently been experimenting by trying paid for RPGmaker games. I played a couple back in the day whilst free on the internet and although never finished them I did enjoy them and appreciate the gameplay and style. A good RPGmaker game if well written and having good gameplay can be a lot of fun.\n\nThis game however is not fun. I was intrigued by the virtual online world aspect and played a couple of the .hack// games back on the PS2 which I did enjoy a lot. Starting this game is about as unwelcoming as a game can get. Plot is poorly explained, battle system convoluted and it has a impregnable card trading game similar to FFIX (I appreciate the card game but modelling on the enjoyable and understandable FFVIII triple triad would be way better).\n\nI'm not an MMO player but I have tried several in the past. This game replicates all the worst aspects of MMO's from unfriendly playerbase (NPCs here), lack of central storyline and requiring trade with other players to buy stuff (what does what is again poorly explained). The fact that the game is hacked to hell and you are playing as an (expletive) hacker makes you wonder how this online world is attractive. Any game with obvious cheaters is instant avoid game in my books, but only one hour in they are everywhere as NPCs, the virtual admin are useless as I'd have take the servers offline. On the subject of NPCs they are modelled on avatars in an online game so the only party member I had lacked all backstory or characteristics important in a solo JRPG, which at the end of the day is what this game is.\n\nI admit I am only an hour in to it but I can't see myself persevering much longer. The fact that I'm writing a negative review so early into it shows how frustrating this game is.\n\nUPDATE\n\nI've now spent 4 hours with the game and it is improving. My initial review was uploaded after spending the first hour in utter frustration. I calmed down and then ploughed my way through the opening and after learning some of the quirks of the game and it does become more enjoyable later on. I will not be altering the initial review above as I think it accurately sums up the start to the game which is possibly the worst opening hour or so in any game I've ever played. In addition I will not be changing the reccommendation although the gameplay is improving the lack of interesting party members really does kill the game for me.","August 3, 2015","false","12.4"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","34","45","0","4"

I didn’t mind finishing it, but I loathed some parts of the game (core hunting, specifically). There’s also a new game + mode, apparently, and I’m not too thrilled about the prospects there. If you want a TLDR, you just read it - if you want to know more, I’ll start by discussing what I felt was poorly done in the game, then finish on the positive notes.\n(Also, item farming spoiler below.)\n\nThe first real issue that I want to bring up is that the plot makes itself scarce. The game sort of hinges on being a simulation of an open world where the main character has no idea what’s going on (in a style similar to .hack and its game series), but that makes for very little character or story development. I’m pretty sure most of the game’s story-related dialogue would fit on 3-5 pages, depending on your font choice. It really reminded me of playing .hack on the PS2 because you really don’t get much back-story… but .hack had the breadth of the manga and anime to draw from, where this game sort of leaves you in the dark because you know nothing about the world going in.\n\nAnother flaw, or host of flaws, is the lack of polish that the game has in certain areas. To be fair, there was actually a massive graphics overhaul done on this game and it did make it much easier on the eyes… but it made it the spots in the game that were missed in the respriting effort and the quirks caused by bad QC during respriting much more apparent. For example, you can often find NPCs that are a few pixels misaligned on their sprite sheets, which causes floating pixels around them while they walk. Additionally, a number of the sprites weren’t updated to the larger side afforded by the graphics update, so they look *really* out of place when they show up.\nThere are also a number of typos in item descriptions and even one in the battle status ailment prompts. It’s pretty off-putting.\n\nTo wrap up negatives, I’ll bring up what is probably a personal issue brought on by my playstyle in both .hack and Data Hacker: the data core collection. I didn’t really spend a lot of time hacking enemies in this game (or .hack) when I realized that you don’t get experience for battles afterward. In .hack, there’s always the possibility of grabbing an interesting piece of equipment, but you usually just get data cores. In Data Hacker, all you have to look forward to are data cores. When Jaque, a main character to the plot, tells you to sell him your cores the second time you meet, it even makes collecting them seem pointless unless you need money - I can see people that haven’t played .hack making that mistake. But I digress. Farming for cores is time-consuming and rather boring. I spent several hours trying to locate a good dungeon to grab the final “Tz” cores from with any regularity when it came time for their use. In that vein, to anyone who reads this:\nCore Farming Dungeons\nAlZo Dungeon, second floor near the two doors: Al, Zo, Ki Cores\nZoTz Dungeon: Ma, Ge, Tz Cores\n\nBut, now, on to the good: this game is playable. If you like RPG Maker games, Data Hacker doesn’t disappoint because it’s very clearly an RPG Maker game. There are some interesting tweaks to the engine and some clever uses. Even a minigame (which I did manage to lock up the game with - don’t walk up to the tournament NPC from his right side) that’s… pretty similar to that card game from FFVIII. The creator obviously put a lot of work into it and, as long as you don’t focus on things you might want to nit-pick, you should be able to see this game standing quite a bit higher than many of the RPG Maker titles out there.","November 1, 2014","true","71.8"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","20","28","4","3"

I must say since the moment I saw this game on Steam it intrigued me and I ended up buying it. And how I enjoyed it, the story is solid, with a few "loop holes" here and there, a Matrix-like tale of a world that is destroyed beyond hope with Humanity escaping to this Online World, an escape from the apocalypse. It's a typical RPG made in RPG Maker and one con I share with Data Hacker: Initiation is the use of some default tyles from the program, but nevertheless, the soundtrack is quite good and fits into the various scenarios you'll encounter throughout the 14-15 hours of gameplay. I must say, if you are looking for a RPG to play, this is the one to go with, being low priced and all. I have initiated my progress, onwards to being corrupted.","March 29, 2015","true","15.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","2"

It's fun and engaging and harkens back to the PS2 legendary series Dot Hack. I've had a blast playing this in the past and I'm looking forward to a replay once Reboot Initiative is ready to go, the new art style and enhanced atmosphere and mapping look great, and I know Ross - the main developer - has been busting his ♥♥♥ on the trilogy so far :) I do have to question the two negative reviews below, however, as they seem highly unfair. Games have bugs and issues, that's just what happens in development, but when it comes to indie devs they actually LISTEN to your feedback; so if you have any troubles, such as rare showstoppers or even just an impassable tile in some random dungeon, please.. take to the forum and report it! Leaving negative feedback on the game, especially on LAUNCH DAY, is really harsh and does more harm than good.\n\nAs a backer of the Kickstarter, I've been privileged to watch the game grow through the development process and it's been really enjoyable. You can really feel that a lot of love and attention to detail went into this project and while there's a fair amount of RTP present, it has been put to great use. The scenario of "Online World" is great, with an engrossing plot and an enormous amount of areas to explore and do battle in. Character customisation is extensive and the ability of Jay, the main pro(an)tagonist, to hack his own avatar and generate his own customised class is unique and enjoyable. What sets this game apart from others is the inclusion of the Hack ability, which allows you overwrite the code of enemies, granting you bonuses against them - or debuffs against your party if the hack fails, and even new and unique items as rewards.\n\nBeing able to hack enemies and gain Cores for use as currency, or even combinations to access new areas, is extremely satisfying - especially against tough foes. You can even use the Hack ability to hack other play characters, which you can do to acquire new members for your party, or even just massive amounts of experience points/cash for bolstering your existing one.\n\nAudio and Visual wise, it's mostly standard RPG Maker, but NRG have put great attention to detail and the use of both custom and standard visuals in order to create the Online World. I have to say though, not once did I feel like the visuals were a detriment to the game, RTP or not, and the atmosphere itself was brilliant. Far better than a lot of other cut'n'paste - expensive - commercial RM titles, that's for sure. The custom soundtrack is especially enjoyable though.\n\nAll in all, I really have had a blast playing this and I'm eagerly awaiting the followups now. Good luck New Reality Games!\n\nThe showstopping bug has since been fixed (same day as release! Like I said; indie devs listen!) so having negative reviews up just harms public opinion of what is a truly great RM title. It's indepth, has an enormous world - worlds, for those familiar with Dot Hack - to explore and with the overhaul coming it's only going to get better. Good luck to everyone playing and I'll see you in Online World \o/","July 22, 2014","true","0.3"," 35 of 57 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","35","57","2","0"

To make it easy to understand for everyone, I decided to make a pro/con list.\n\nPositive aspects of this game:\n\n- The music (I really liked it, even if it was the only thing about this game!)\n\nNegative aspects of this game:\n\n- NPCs run through walls (they really did...in the first town, the second NPC you see....starts run to north...if you follow him, you will see, that he runs through the wall next to the door)\n\n- Enemies on battle screen are not the same as on world screen.\n\n- Really boring story (at the beginning, no real intro, no innovation...just plain: Hey, let's tell a online-game story in an RPG...most ideas are stolen from other games and/or animes)\n\n- Tutorials are hidden in form of mails on the ground.\n\n- Boring graphics (Houses just look like crap, characters are looking nearly the same except skin colour, I have played SNES games, that looked thousand times better than this one.)\n\n- Fighting menu (many chooseable types of attacks with no content, if it is not available, then cut it out, until it is available - really annoying)\n\n- Tons of grammar and spelling mistakes .... (The intro picture says, that the title is Data Hacker: Initation <--- that word doesn't exist - commas are missing totally and this from people, who actually come from UK)\n\n- I am sure there was more stuff, that was crappy about this game, but wasting more time with this review is not really necessary, I think!\n\nBTW. @NewRealityGames: Talking about expensive pixel artists, after earning over 1000% more money, then planned through kickstarter, is just an ugly move! And criticising me for giving your game a bad review is just embarrassing. Even after spending 70 more minutes with your game, I still think, that it is still not worth the money. It's boring, not really creative and contains not enough self made content to be worth a buck! You don't like that review? I don't care, because it is not for you. Instead it is for the people, who think about spending their hard earned money for this altogether pasted piece of software!\n\n\nOld review:\n\nThought about playing this game, while watching a nice movie on the desktop.\nBut I couldn't! Why, you ask?\nBecause this game forces to center on the desktop, while in windowed mode.\nThat's annoying!\n\nAnother thing, I didn't liked, are the animations. You see clearly a chicken running at you, but instead of a chicken you get another bird as an enemy. Weren't there enough sprites in your RPG Maker or have you just been too lazy to make your own?\n\nI can't and won't support this game in any way. There are dozens of really good free games made in RPG Maker. This is not one of them. No, the maker even wants 5 € for this game.\n\nAnd the worst part about that is, that the people in europe got to pay even 12% more for this game.","January 29, 2015","false","1.3"," 66 of 117 people (56%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","56","66","117","15","15"

There is also a New Game+ mode that changes up quite a few loot drops, and adds a few new encounters and bosses.\n\nThe developer is also prompt with addressing reported bugs and issues.\n\nAll of that said, there are some drawbacks.  Around half way through the story can turn into a grind-fest for items needed to unlock essential dungeons, if you haven't been hacking and stockpiling these items beforehand.  There are also a number of fights where the difficulty curve goes fairly insane without much warning - this is especially true of some fo the optional content of NG+.  It is also very easy to fall into the "hacker" ending through sidequesting, without really realizing it until the end.\n\nI would recommend it on story alone; it is reminiscent of the .hack series, but taken quite a bit further in the sequel.  The combat is decent, fairly standard RPG fare that is spiced up a bit with a decent number of classes for your AI companions.  With two endings, and a number of items and companions that cross over between playthroughs - and some that are only available in the second playthrough - it has a bit of replay value.","November 20, 2014","true","39.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

I imported my save file from the DRM-free version. My actual playtime is a hair under 28 and a half hours.\n\nI will preface this by saying I am a child of the 8 and 16-bit console eras, so I have always had a fondness for RPG Maker games.\n\nI got this game originally through a free game bundle, along with the second game in the series, Corruption. To be perfectly honest, my favorite game by that creator is Fantasyche: Mike, which the creator is now giving away for free. It's more of a standard fantasy RPG, but I'm a sucker for the kind of plot it has.\n\nPros:\n+ The music is delightful. I paid backer rewards for Reboot to get the soundtrack, but even the version in the game files themselves are quite nice, and a number of tracks are going right on my music player.\n\n+ The atmosphere is well-developed. The game is quite successful in evoking that MMOJRPG feeling.\n\n+ The story gripped me.\n\n+ Trioarch is fun.\n\nCons\n\n- Grinding. It is not quite as bad as other games, if one uses, say, the Arena, but data hacking can initially get kind of tedious. That said, it''s worlds better than, say, Final Fantasy VIII's "draw" system.\n\n- Skill cost seems a bit high early- and mid-(?) game. I've taken to grinding the Trioarch tournament repeatedly so I don't have to worry about it.\n\n- The random item mechanic can be both a positive and a negative, but it is listed as a negative here because most people are not obsessive save-scummers - that is to say, people that save and reloads until they get the outcome they want. The only constant items seem to be the key items, certain quest rewards, and the items given to you by in-game trades.\n\n- The variety of enemy "mobs" in the in-game dungeons could be increased, and I was disappointed there weren't as many people to trade with. Given the scale of the game and the sheer number of NPCs, I suppose this one can be forgiven.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nFor US$5, it is totally worth it, if you enjoy RPGs or the story grabs you. The developer has been nothing but pleasant and even kind to me, and he's been more than receptive to bug reports I have filed, though I've only counted two as of this steam release, and given the massive update that was rolled out, I'd say that's quite something, especially given that one bug is a minor annoyance you have to look for and the other one is a lovely exploit.\n\nThis is a lovely game that would be made even better by an in-game bestiary, hint hint cute pony eyes.","February 11, 2015","true","144.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

The new area "The summit" was really fun to solve the puzzle behind that new area. It's more easy to get the Trioarch cards now has they are spread across the map in treasure chests in Strife and Leonhart. The bored part of the game was removed, farming Data Cores.

To redress that issue I'll throw my hat in the ring with a fair and unbiased view: I'm not generally a fan of ANY RPG Maker style game but to me the way this one is set out is more original and more enjoyable than most. And that's about all I can say because any RPG Maker game is never going to be anything like a AAA game BUT there is certainly some enjoyment to be had from them and you could do FAR worse than start with this one. Add to this the fact that the publisher has made available the entire catalogue plus all future releases in a pack (that is currently on 'silly offer') and these will be all the RPG Maker content you will likely ever want.","April 11","true","5.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","4"

That's rare enough to mention.\nIt is focused on content and story. The writing is good bringing a strong plot, humor, and wits.\n\nI have put many hours into Data Hacker : Initiation pre Steam release. I replayed the start to be able to write this review. Yes it is not the strongest start you may have, especially if you are familiar with dotHack, SwordArtOnline or LogHorizon. However the game builds its own unique and engrossing story and will keep challenging you.\nAnd it takes a few gibes at the last decade of MMORPG on the way.\n\nThe main developper, Ross, has been funding the Datastream saga through kickstarter. he has a very open and reactive approach, that allowed a very high level of polish in his games.\n\nHacking can be a dangerous chance game, but it delivers appreciable rewards for the challenges it may pose.\n\nAlthough DH:I relies mostly on standard RPGMaker assets, the OnlineWorld rendering has a strong atmosphere.\nThe soundtrack is enjoyable, but I prefer the one in the second installment of the saga, Data Hacker : Corruption.\n\nOverall I recommend the Data Hacker games to any JRPG player ready to let their imagination work a bit instead of relying purely on their graphics card.","October 30, 2014","true","0.7"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"

I've played a lot of mmos, so having a single player game that sort of makes fun of them and ties in to a lot of their ropes is up my alley.\n- Decent tilesets. Mostly RTP stuff, but with no annoying chibi! So yea lotsa bonus points for that. No original stuff but uses some good non default sets too.\n- Decent rpg mechanics. Not really very challenging and sadly lacking in any difficulty settings. But there is a huge amount of characters to recruit. Tho 99% of them are just generic "hacked" versions, they have no dialog and just serve to make the battles more interesting. The games rather unbalanced in terms of whats effective tho - use magic and win pretty much. Melee is extremely underpowered. Mainly due to the fact most every monster has a elemental weakness you can exploit, but melee weapons with elemental types are ultra rare, basically non existent.\n- The game has a random loot system. Its pretty simple, but fun - adds some extra replay value as you can just save/load and reloot the chests a while to try to get the rare good stuff.\n- Decent length 15-20 hours , and a ton more if you want to get all the achievements like I did. (requires multiple playthroughs - game has NG+)\n- Great music. One track is especially good - kind of it's main theme.\n\nCons:\n-Extremely poor default performance, with a flat out broken fullscreen mode. I reported this weeks ago and even posted the fix (check discussions) yet the author still hasn't fixed it. He is actually really responsive and quick about updating to fix bugs, so not sure why he didn't address this rather massive one.\n- Stuttering in the major cities, even after my fix. Not too bad, but for a rpg maker game, it really shouldn't happen.\n- Lots of bugs remain, though the authors still working on fixing them.\n- The game has a sort of good/bad ending depending your actions. Getting the "good" ending is unneccesarily difficult due to it being poorly set up. If you hack a single wrong player or even certain npcs, you can fail.","September 16, 2015","true","57.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Myself and my viewers, the lot of them, did not really care for the dialogue. They didn't like the whole tutorial system, along with me. I thought the tutorials came out of place, if you managed to skip that part it was gone... You should do it automatically when a new mechanic or feature or option is introduced.\n\nThe concept was alright. I am a big fan of .hack. I love that series and to introduce something of the sort in RPG Maker, well, it was neat. Although after playing x amount of hours... I didn't see much story. Unless I missed something. The battle scaling was off a bit. And the little bit of lag I got in the main place was a little annoying. No biggie though.\n\nThings I really liked were the unique data hack skill giving tons of options on allies or items. Even data cores. Also, the learning script. I thought it was nice to have a feature in like that. Although it's downfall was that most of those skills were later parts of the game. Credit didn't come at the bundle, at least not what I saw.\n\nOverall, it was decent. You made some more games off of it. Maybe I will see how those are.\n\nEven though I will recommend this game, it is for those players who like the mmorpg style in RPG Maker and lots of grinding. Enjoy.\n\nP.S...
