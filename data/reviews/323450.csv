It would be a very hard game if not the fact that there is no death penalty and every battle can be repeated as many times as needed.\nThe story and characters aren't particularly interesting and quite simple. The ingame (not battle) character animation is funny in jumpy-jittery way, it grown on me with time for some reason and I find it hilarious now. The characters are partly voiced (Japanese only), the important dialogs and combat, most of dialogue is just text.\nThe story ends in a way that makes apparent there is a sequel (not really a cliffhanger but close). I know it's the series, so no surprise here.\nCombat is probably most interesting part of the game, it's somewhat overbalanced with negative sides to everything, these are partly countered much later into the game. Character progression and growth is slow in this game and it's impossible to overlevel. Maybe not exactly impossible but close to it. If underleveled though, party stands no chance against stronger enemies and bosses, so a game does make you not to avoid battles, even if it is possible to run from all of those except with bosses.\nThe game has random encounters and uses overpainted monsters method to populate lands and dungeons, too much for my liking.\nThere is an arena, which gives no xp at all.\nDungeon design is boring and very repetitive, not being ingame dungeon maps too, it's too easy to lose or rather forget you way for this reason.\nIt might seem like a game is just bad, but it's quite enjoyable at first, it's a tad too long for it to stay this way.","February 4, 2015","true","56.3"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","42","47","0","0"

I'm happy to say that even though this game is a port of a mobile phone game it's high quality and has some good resolution and graphics. The play mechanics are solid with the keyboard / mouse and the dialog has charm to it. Japanese Voice Overs are there as well. The big deal breaker and I won't give it a thumbs down for it would be the fact that you can't use a PC game controller with it.. You have to be in front of your computer to play the game.

But the game looked good enough, so it seemed worth a try.\n\nLooks can be deceiving, though, as the game feels cheaply made in a lot of regards. Most characters have only 2 animations per direction (which makes NPCs look like they're jumping from foot to foot); cities, villages, and dungeons look very bland; bridges appear as if they could collapse at any moment; a lot of enemies are color-swapped or resized and so on.\n\nI could overlook these flaws if the rest of the game managed to be interesting, but it's generic all the way through. It's just going through the motions of every other classic JRPG without managing to ever be engaging. The characters barely develop, it's hard to take the story seriously, and despite being only 12 hours long (ignoring a lot of the sidequests in the latter half of the game), it still feels too long.\n\nI do have to praise the battle system, though. While it's 3D graphics cannot stand up to the rest of the game, it's actually entertaining ... if you can overlook the balancing, which jumps from very easy to really hard (even on the easy difficulty). But even the hard battles aren't too bad, as there's always a warning before every boss and even a healing point if you're playing on easy. And characters are fully healed upon leveling up. And should you ever need to grind, there's a handy autobattle-system which skips animations.\n\nThe battles are also where the soundtrack can really shine. But that alone cannot save a generic game. So don't expect to be amazed. It might be entertaining for a while, but I doubt it's going to stay in anyone's memory for long.","January 12, 2015","false","22.3"," 91 of 163 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","91","163","5","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/recommended/323450/","fredriknd","Fnord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/","2595 products in account","Alphaida Genesis is what I would describe as an entry level JRPG. It's quite simple and does not try to innovate much, but rather it sticks to the basics and does it in a very approachable way.\nThis game was originally a mobile phone game, but were it not for some UI elements, it would hardly be noticeable. The port from phone to PC is surprisingly good, with one exception: You can't use a gamepad for this game.\n\nGraphics & Sound\nAlphaida Genesis has 2 very different looks to it, depending on if you're in combat or not. The non-combat portions have a simple & colourful 2D look to it, that would be at home on the PS1 (the sprites are slightly too detailed for a SNES game), while combat is in 3D and looks more like an early PS2 game in terms of detail & style.\nThe difference between the two is jarring, and it helps give the game a very incoherent look. While none of the modes look bad, barring overuse of the same few tiles on the overworld, they don't mix well together. Personally I found the combat to look far more appealing than the 2D overworld part, which has a rather cheap look to it, with poor animations and the above mentioned overuse of the same few tiles.\nIn terms of sound, the game is very middle of the road. There's nothing really wrong with the music, but nor does it stand out. Sound effects do have some weight to them in combat, so that's at least something. The voice acting is generic. With generic I mean that if you've the least bit familiar with Japanese games and/or anime you can tell almost exactly what a character will sound like by just looking at it. Also, the voice actors do seem to overact quite often, and I can't tell if it's for comedic effect, or if they're just not very good.\n\nGameplay\nIn terms of gameplay, Alphaida Genesis is very traditional. If you've played SNES or PS1 era JRPGs, you know what you're in for. Random encounters, turn based battles, relatively linear character progression (though you do get some choices in what magic skills to develop for your character) and all that good stuff. If you like traditional JRPGs, you'll feel right at home here, if you don't, this game won't change your mind. One nice thing is that the game will warn you when you're about to get a random encounter, as the borders of the screen changes colour. This, and a relatively low encounter rate, made sure that the random encounters did not feel annoying.\n\nStory\nAnd here is where the game falls flat. The base premise of the story is not bad. You live in a world where synthetically made humans exist, and where they do a lot of the work. These are treated like second class citizens (so basically slaves), though there are people who want to elevate them to equals. A murder is committed by one of them, and after this there's talk of getting rid of all the synthetically made humans. It's not the most original story, but it could have been interesting.\nSadly the writing is just dire, and there's a lot of dialogue here. It's hard to feel invested in a game where the writing is as bad as it is in this game. The dialogue between the characters feels like it would belong in some second rate fan fic rather than in a game released on steam that's made by developer that's been around since the mid 80's. I just could not bring myself to keep on playing, as the more I played, the less I liked all the main characters.\n\nFinal thoughts\nIf it was not for the terrible writing, Alphaida Genesis would have been an inoffensive and rather generic JRPG that would have worked well as an entry level game. A modern day Mystic Quest if you may (though it's a bit more involved than Mystic Quest). But as it stands, this is not a game that I would recommend to anyone. The writing is not even funny bad, it's just cringe worthy, and makes the game nigh unplayable for me.","April 22","false","7.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The game is called Alphadia Genesis and was published by Kemco Games for the iOS, Android, Wii U and PC. The game is a fairly traditional RPG with with 2D overworld graphics that transition into fully 3D battle graphics. Standard turn-based combat, but has a nice combo system that can reward better XP/Currency/Skill Points depending on how large the combo was at the end of the battle. The game features a world map that done in the classic open world Final Fantasy with the use of airships and boats to get you from point A to point B. The game does feature some voice over work but is currently only in japanese but all text has been translated. The controls are responsive and the game has a fair soundtrack.\nAs for the story it is pretty basic, you are the top swordsman in your kingdom, the King sends you on a mission to investigate a murder in a nearby town, you sister tags along because she is the brains of the operation and you are the brawn. you meet many new characters along the way some of which join your party to help investigate the outbreak of murders across the world.\nFinal thoughts, i enjoy the combat system and the banter between the party members. The graphics and soundtrack could be better, but for a game made for the mobile platforms i feel they are more than adequate. My favorite part of the game is the large amount of hidden chest and secret areas to explore. For modern day gamers i would give this game a 6/10. But if you grew up playing the old NES/SNES/PS1 RPGs like i did, i feel this game would garner a higher rating of 7.5/10","February 22, 2015","true","32.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

I will be using a "Pro's vs Con's" style of review because I don't personally believe 1 out of 10 type of reviews fairly portray the ups and downs of a game. You may enjoy different things than I do, and someone else may not mind something that's a pet peeve of yours and so on. I believe the best I can do is write good and bad and let each reader of this make up there own opinions to check this out or not.\n\nPro's\n\n-First and foremost for me was the 3d models in combat. You don't find that often in steam jrpg's.\n\n-Tons of hidden rooms and treasure chests through the the game. To give perspective there is an achievement for getting all 220 chests unlocked and I found over 200 in my lone play through.\n\n-Decent length to it for bang for your buck. It took me a little over 20 hours to complete the story.\n\n-Not hard to get achievements if you're an achievement hunter. I acquired 16/20 in my game buy doing  just the main story. The only one that's really hard is the aforementioned 220 chests achievement.\n\n-It does have voice acting in the game. However it's in Japanese so  if that's not your thing then you might not like this (I don't speak Japanese so I can't speak for the quality and I played most of the game with it all muted and Pandora underneath.)\n\nCon's\n-Meh story.. it definitely falls under the "Bad guys doing bad things to innocents" Kind kind of generic story for a jrpg but really more than that it's a love story between characters, love triangle included.So it wasn't for me but that doesn't mean that's not your cup of tea so to each there own.\n\n-The characters in Alphadia Genesis are as cookie cutter as they get. Know the stereotype? Well I'm sure it's in here. Fray is the protagonist who never gives up especially on his love. Aurra although my favorite is the younger sister of Fray and the smart one in the group. Enah is quite, Walter is annoyingly jealous until the last 10% of the game. And Grande is the big guy with a heart. Then we have Corone... *shivers* the super annoying lead female of the group. I found myself right click spamming dialog when she or Walter started to talk at length.\n\n-The animations for the spells and other moves in the game basically came down to a color shooting across the screen. Whether it's a fireball or Fray's daggers doing some sort of combo.","February 26","true","33.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So unless you just absolutely love reading about how someone isn't sure of their feelings for another and how they're not sure if they should tell their feelings to the other people, then my suggestion is to just go watch Blade Runner.

It's not worth the $10 price tag, especially since it's a port of a mobile game that only costs $4 on the android market. True, the steam version does not have microtransactions like the mobile version does but that alone does not justify doubling the price. The in game shop is still there but instead of buying the points to spend in it you can find them hidden in various places through the game. I also have to kinda question Kemco's decision to have this game as their first PC port not only because this is the 6th entry in a series, but also because it has other games that would have been a better choice.\n\nWith that out of the way.....it's a decent JRPG. The story is ok, not the best ever but it's better than most of the RPG maker games that are starting to flood steam. The combat makes up for it though, the PC market is a bit lacking in decent retro style turn based RPGs (I will highlight "decent", there's no shortage of retro turn based RPGs but unfortunately a lot of them are terrible) and since that's basically all Kemco does hopefully they start porting more of their games over. Hopefully they also price them to make them worth purchasing outside of a sale.","January 3","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is not a game that will deeply move you with its characters or storyline. But that's okay, you play this game in spite of that. Because this game chooses to play it safe,  be pretty predictable, and doesn't try to overstay its welcome with you.\n\nBasically if you're looking for a light, turn-based JRPG, this game will fill that desire in your heart. Actually I'd recommend this game even to newbies of the JRPG Genre because the game isn't too terribly difficult at any point. If it ever does, you can always grind it out oldschool style for a few levels at least.","February 1","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talesofphantasia/recommended/323450/","talesofphantasia","Make","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talesofphantasia/","48 products in account","Product received for free\n\nAlphadia Genesis is a JRPG originally developed for smartphones, then ported to Wii U and finally to PC.\n\nThe story is your typical JRPG fare. It's basically about politics whenever robot-like humanoids, called clones, should be free of their masters or not. Clones are often treated as second-class citizens and often feared if they ever turn against their masters. If you've ever played a Tales of -game, then you're probably tired of this trope. The game has been translated by John Sears (known for Trails in the Sky translation), by the way.\n\nThe character personalities are your generic anime ones, where the designs are similar to Tales of -games. For an example, Enah is a Colette look-a-like with blue hair who also uses Chakram as a weapon, but as she is a clone, she has the robotic monotone "Chobits" type of personality. Artwork itself is nicely drawn, though.\n\nThe gameplay is basically town > dungeon > town > dungeon and so on. Towns are very small, you talk to NPCs, accept quests, do shopping etc. Dungeons are either mazes or just corridors to walk through with no real puzzles or "gimmicks". You can zoom in and out, but it always resets whenever you move. This zoom mechanism is basically used to find hidden points for an in-game special shop, which probably worked as a "IAP Store" in the mobile version.\n\nWhile there are a lot of random encounters, escaping works most of the time. There is an consumble item that let's you decrease the amount of random encounters, but can be obtained very late in the game.\n\nThe battle system is turn-based similar to Final Fantasy X and Grandia II, where the fastest acts first. The available commands are your typical RPG stuff (Attack, Defense, Magic etc.). However, there is a command where your inactive party members perform a special attacks. There is a system where inactive party members contribute to the overall party by giving bonuses such as "more EXP" or "more powerful attacks", this is all based on the combination of inactive characters. Kind of similar to Tales of Destiny (PS2 remake) support system.\n\nThe game uses a magic system where each playable character has their own element (similar to Chrono Trigger), and then you can add a secondary element with an elemental ring which allows you to learn different kinds of spells depending what elemental combinations you level up and so on. These elementals are Fire, Water and Light. Eventually, you might level up all elementals for each character where their spell pool will be the same.\n\nThe game doesn't sound too bad, but there are few shortcomings:\nNo gamepad support (have to use Joy2Key or something similar).\nLocked to 720p. No proper resolution options. Steam Overlay bugs out in game's full screen mode, so use Borderless Gaming.\nLocked to 30 FPS. This wouldn't be too bad if this was a full 3D game, but the game uses 2D sprites on field, where the camera movement looks janky because of it. Doesn't help that most sprite animations only have 2 frames per direction.\nOnly about 10 music tracks. So most of the music is recycled throughout the game. Oddly enough, the piano tune which I found beautiful is only used in the title screen...\nAbout 15-30 hours of length, depending if you fight every random encounter or not. Add additional 10 hours if you do the bonus content/sidequests (including grinding for maximum levels).\nIt's rather weird how some major scenes have voices for 5 lines and then other lines in the same scene are not voiced at all, Only Japanese dub is available, so if you're not a fan, you can turn voices off.","May 4","true","55.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
