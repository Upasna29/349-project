But those who oppose will be crushed, over and over again! Now offer me some uranium and I shall reward you with money and life. Or at least one of them. Wait! What was that? No..No! Krrchhzzz..\nI am in charge now! And what I have to say is: Kneel down my fellow…”\n\nWhat was that all about right now? It is about Obey, a multiplayer game, presented in plain but solid graphics, that could revolutionize the whole genre with a unique psychological approach. Do you know “Watership Down”? If not, try to imagine a bunch of small rabbits that start on the same map, trying to get control of a robot. You start as one of those small puppies, running for your life to be the first to enter it. If you succeed, you get rewarded with instant cash and the ability to operate the big guy. That means more cash and the power to control the other rabbits. Or not. If you are second, prepare to get fried by sentries...\n\nTalking about cash. The main goal of Obey is to be the first who gains 10k Dollars. This can be achieved in multiple ways. You get money every “tick”, meaning a certain period of time, after which your money gets a constant boost. Obtaining the robot triples the amount, rabbits with collars get a bit, “nacked” rabbits get even less. The next option is the “Payout”. That means: The player who is in charge of the robot can place money on the map to gather, manipulate or reward his minions. The last option is the Food or Drop Box. Again, the player controlling the robot can set this box to autopay, cashing your bunnies for delivering special items you need to ensure your reign. These Items get dropped by a Dropship, which also spawns killed rabbits.\n\nInstead of writing a huge text about them, I will just list the items with a small description:\n\nList of items:\nUranium - The main-resource and moneymaker. Robot buys it for 100, rabbit dumps it (and earns a small auto-pay), robot gets 300 (win-win)\nRockets - Secondary weapon with much impact. Rabbits get hurt even if they are hiding behind obstacles.\nFuel - Robot needs it to charge its flamethrower. Very useful to kill nearby rabbits.\nBatteries - Sentries surrounding the robot only work if they are activated and that costs batteries. Powerful defense.\nCorpse - Not really a traditional item, but If a bunny dies via Sentry or Flamethrower, it leaves a corpse. Taking and throwing it into the Dropbox, makes the “ruler” lose money.\nSensors - activates if a bunny is nearby.\nCollars - Robots “Main-Spy”. Collars are highlighted with yellow triangles on the map so whoever sits inside the Big Guy can easily see, where the minions are gathering. It can be used to trap the robot as well since it still works even if not worn around a neck, the robot can simply detonate every collar he wishes to. Useful for rabbits: Collars grant more money and protect from enemy sentries. If you made it that far..\nLights - Well, lighting an area so bunnies can be seen although Big Brother isn`t watching with his blaze\nMines - Bunnies can plant them, only robot sees them if they are activate and only robot can deactivate them. At least without dying.\nFences - Or Laser fences - Cheap defense since every bunny gets fried upon touching.\nTalking about Control.You might think that being a rabbit outside of the robot is a painful and boring destiny. It is not. Politics and weaving intrigues, manipulating your teammates or even the high ruler himself. How to obey for some minutes? Getting presents in exchange for dumping items and betraying your teammates. Or team up with 2 or 3 others, kill yourself with laser fences and let them dump your corpses into the Dropbox, thus blasting rulers gold away. Losing your collar may look the best opportunity to sneak into the robot but no risk without a price. Wearing no collar means getting less money. And what about the high emperor himself? Should he act violently, showing no mercy and run into the danger of getting attacked from multiple sides? Granting a wish might be a good chance to win a follower. Like it says:”Don`t bite the hand that feeds you.”\nWho needs that robot anyway. My first match was won by a guy that never entered the robot. He always played nice, never taking off his collar. Instead of taking the risk he played after the rules. But not every match is the same and your tactics should be reconsidered every minute to ensure that you are earning the 10k Dollars at first.\n\nSummary:\nUpdate:Obey has been in Early Access for quite some time now - and I still highly recommend it. There are six maps and the map editor, allowing players to build their very own battlefields for free, ensuring nearly infinite possibilities, depending on the community. It should be said that a microphone is expected. There is a chat available but making announcements, threats or plans with teammates does not only work better through the integrated voice chat, it is also way more funny. That said everybody should be aware of the fact that Obey is multiplayer only. Dex managed to implement decent AI that fills the open gaps. Don`t underestimate CPU-Bunnies! They can enter the robot and feel - nothing!!!\n\nI hope lobbies get filled with more people playing since this game may be good with friends but offers a nice new psychological touch when testing your powers of persuasion with strangers. It is not a game for everybody but not only a new approach in a worn-off genre but also a great example for what indie developers can do - so please show your support!\n\nVerdict: 9/10\n\n\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Dan Dez\nKey erhalten von: Dan Dez","May 22, 2015","true","6.6"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","45","52","5","5"

Yea I don't think so!\n\nFirst off, this game is SUPER unique, I've honestly never played any game like this before.\nWhen I first started playing this game, I went straight for the tutorial and right after to the multiplayer part.\nI quickly met this super friendly guy in-game, who was eager to show and teach me how exactly this game worked and some of the aspects in the game, which the tutorial simply couldn't show you.\nIt turns out, this great guy was the developer of the game, he's a really friendly and nice guy.\n\nIn this game you're a cute little bunny, your mission is to first achieve a certain amount of money.\nThere are different ways to do this, however, you can either be an obedient bunny and do as the robot tells you or be the disobedient bunny and take control over the robot, and start controlling the obedient bunnies.\nWhen playing as the robot, make sure to keep track of your obedient/disobedient bunnies and make deals with them. This way they'll keep OBEYing you and you'll stay in control.\n\nPros:\n+ Super great potential.\n+ Extremely friendly community.\n+ Great strategy game.\n+ Negotiating with people. (Deny, deny, deny. If that doesn't work then just lie, lie, lie).\n+ Choice between being the evil robot or the obedient/disobedient bunny.\n+ Great response time from developer.\n+ Nice variation in maps. (Game includes level editor)\n\nCons:\n- If you don't have a mic, this game could become a little challenging.\n- Not super many players yet. (This is where you come into the picture, JUST BUY IT!).\n\n\nA tip I would like to give you all, "when" you buy this game is: Start out with the tutorial and try listening closely to what it tells you. When you have done that, go for an hour or two in multiplayer to get a grasp of the game and then turn back to the tutorial. I myself felt like I didn't completely understand the game after the first tutorial attempt, a bit much information to grasp for me atleast, but when I played a bit of multiplayer and got a hang of how stuff worked, I took a quick turn back to the tutorial and it just suddenly made a whole bunch of sense.\n\nI rate this game atleast 9/10, close to 10/10.\n\nWould I buy this game?\nHell yea!\n\nWould I recommend you to buy the game?\nYes, I'd even recommend you to buy a 4-pack to share with your friends!","December 11, 2015","true","9.2"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","38","45","5","0"

The aim of the game is to be the first to achieve a certain monetary goal (usually 10,000 cents) and the means to achieve this goal varies considerably.\n\nAt the beginning of each match each player finds themselves in control of a cute little bunny rabbit (a hamster or guinea pig perhaps?). The first player to enter the Robot doorway is the player who gets to control it, thus a race is on. Upon entering the robot the electric sentries will all power up rewarding any late comers with electrocution, there is no second place.\n\nPlayers earn money in several different ways.\n\n1. Per Tick. Controlling the robot pays the most, wearing an obedience collar pays a little, wearing nothing pays something but not much.\n\n2. Robot Payouts - The player in the robot can drop money wherever he wants in order to reward or manipulate bunnies to obey.\n\n3. Drop Box - The robot can set the Drop Box to autopay on deposit (25,50,75 or 100) in order to encourage the bunnies to deposit items.\n\nItems\n'''''''''''"\nUranium - Costs 100 - Pays the Robot 300 when deposited (ie. Robot can buy it for 100, bunny can then deposit it for autopay of 100, robot and player therefore make 100 profit each).\n\nBatteries - Provides a single charge to the sentry defences whereby the robot, upon activating said charge, will cause all nearby bunnies without a collar to be electrocuted. Bunnies can protect themselves by hiding behind wreckage they drop between themselves and the defence pylon.\n\nFuel - Ammunition for the the robots flamethrower which is the only weapon which can directly shoot the robot doorway.\n\nRockets - Ammunition for the robots multiple rocket launcher. The robot can kill bunnies hiding behind obstacles with this.\n\nMines - Once deployed only the robot can see where they are.\n\nLaser Fence - A deployable fence which will instantly fry any bunny walking into it.\n\nPointer - Allows bunnies to temporarily mark a location on the map. These are usually used by bunnies who take upon the role of an informant on behalf of the robot against their fellow bunnies.\n\nSensors - Indicates when a bunny is nearby.\n\nLights - Keeps an area lit as the robot can generally only see where the searchlight is aimed.\n\nCollars - Obedience collars allow the player in the robot to easily see the location of the bunny wearing it. The robot can also destroy the collar thus killing the bunny whom is wearing it. Collars grant a bunny immunity to the robots sentry defences. They also generate an increased income for the wearer.\n\nCorpses - These are left behind when a bunny is electrocuted or burned and when deposited in the Drop Box they cause the player controlling the robot to lose money.\n\n\nPlayers have to decide, moment by moment, how they will play the game. Should they obey the robot and make some money doing so, yet by doing so they empower the player controlling the robot? Should they spend their time trying to subvert the robot whereby they could reap huge gains yet in the meantime not be making much money? Should they inform on the other bunnies or should they perhaps try and corpse the robot? Should they cast dispersion on the other players with subtle comments? Should they tactfully try and create a certain atmosphere amongst the other players? Should they band together with the other bunnies against the player in the lead? Should they lure other players via baiting them to do certain things? The choices are ongoing and dynamic and are only really limited to our cognitive ability.\n\nThe game has fully integrated voice chat and therefore a microphone is essential to get the most out of the experience. Players reliant on keyboard only to communicate will be at a significant disadvantage in regards to their ability to influence the other players.\n\n\nAfter having played numerous games I emphatically give this title a thumbs up and highly recommend people pick themselves up a copy. This game will definitely bring out the worst in you and at the same time bring a smile to your face as you see the worst brought out in others.\n\nTown of Salem was good, but this is much better. :)\n\n\n\nBrave New World + Nineteen Eighty-Four + Propaganda (Bernays) + Pavlov + Sun Tzu + Computer Code = Obey.","May 21, 2015","true","241.1"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","29","33","5","0"

Conversing with your opponents is practically required, so beware purchasing if your rig lacks a mic or you don't enjoy, you know... talking.  Otherwise, have fun playing as Little Bunny FooFoo hopping through the forest, jumping into the giant killer robot of doom and extorting money and guns from all your little bunny friends via bribery and threats of flamey death!\n\nOBEY is a remarkably strange, fascinating game with a steep learning curve.  The tutorial is an absolute must, and even that doesn't cover all the tactics involved - although hopefully this will be improved before the game's final release.  The game is also multiplayer only, so if you prefer sticking to single player games, you can skip this game (and the rest of this review).\n\nRemember those "friendly"(ha!) tabletop sessions of Risk where you tried to convince good ol' Bob spread across Asia that it was completely in his own interest to invade Canada in order to wipe out Evil Overlord Fred, all while you hunkered down in Austraila peacefully hoarding billions of troops to win you the game a few turns later?  Or that one game of Monopoly where you convinced your little sister that giving you a monopoly on Boardwalk and Parkplace in return for Reading Railroad would actually win HER the game in the end?\n\nWell, OBEY is just that; a game of dirty diplomacy and friendly manipulation.  In OBEY, your goal as a tiny, cute little bunny rabbit is to take control of a giant deadly robot with laser-eyes and a flamethrower, then somehow convince all the other tiny, cute - and extremely treacherous - little bunny rabbits that feeding you the money you need to win and the weapons you need to kill them dead is definitely a good idea.\n\nThe gameplay smushes together stealth, observation, strategy, and game theory into a 3D world populated by you and all your bunny rabbit friends waddling slowly around and trying to make money, along with one giant killer robot with laser eyes of doom who can make money faster than anyone.  The robot can be taken over by anyone who sneaks inside, but it can also lay the smack down on any bunny who twitches their nose the wrong way -, or 'generously' pay an allowance to the bunnies who play nicely.   To win, you must pay close attention to your surroundings and what every other player is up to, negotiate with - and lie to - other players , and above all not aggravate the giant robot with laser eyes of doom before you can shuffle your cuddly little bunny butt inside to kick out the current occupant and take it over.\n\nAll in all, if you have a microphone and sometimes like thinking, strategizing, and negotiating in your games instead of the usual run-n-gun, I recommend you give this quirky game a shot.  However, this comes with a strong 'buyer beware': as with any multiplayer game, enjoyment depends on the people you play with, so you will need to bring friends or be OK relying on random strangers (who hopefully speak your language and have mics of their own).\n\n---\n\nNote:   Due to the social nature of the game, you may want to split a 4-pack with friends.  If that doesn't work for you, at least the developer seems to be quite active and doing his best to help people learn the game, so it seems likely that even games with strangers will be fun.   Of course, keep in mind that OBEY is in Early Access, so it is difficult to tell how popular it will be down the line, and how easy it will be to find quality random matches.  Thus, your final mileage may vary.\n\nNote 2:  The giant killer robot of doom may not actually have laser eyes.  But it should.\n\nReceived a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.","November 21, 2015","true","2.0"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","27","32","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/346970/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1505 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOBEY is a game with a very interesting concept which I will describe in the next paragraph. It is entirely multiplayer as interaction with other players is crucial. It's unlike any other games I've played before and its concept is very well made.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:In OBEY, one player is a leader and controls all the other players from a giant robot. This robot has the ability to shoot bullets and rockets that kill the disobeying players, if the leader sees them and shoots them.\nOther players, bunnies, have to listen to the leader. They have to wear tracking collars and carry weapons into the robot's feedbox. The leader pays them for that, but the point of the game is for the bunnies to sneak into the robot and take the leader's position. In other works, you have to obey until you have the chance to hide and sneak to the robot.\n\nPros:    An unique idea that is not just unique, but also well executed. It's very interesting to observe how different leaders have different approaches to controlling other and how players in control respond to their manipulation.\nMaps are well-balanced as they allow the leader to control the players, but other players are still able to take over the leadership if they play well and have good tactics.\nThis game encourages interaction between players which includes giving orders, lying, deceiving and betraying other players for money.\nThe maps and objects look great. They are simple and modern-looking. Also, the soundtrack fits in very nicely.\nThe developer is active and is constantly making new updates to the game.\nThis game is also made for Linux and MacOS powered systems.\nThere is also a tutorial which explains step by step how things work by walking the player along different objects and stages of the game.\nIn case there is a lack of players online, you can also play via LAN.\nLow system requirements.\nCons:    At certain hours, there might be a lack of online players. Mostly, however, you should be able to find a running game.\nTags on Steam also include "Includes level editor", but can't seem to be able to find it anywhere. Levels can be made using third-party software: link[www.mapeditor.org]\nSometimes, it's hard to play when a leader is someone without a microphone. I don't know how the developer could fix it, though.\nI feel like the price is a bit high, at least for the current amount of content. There should be more game modes, weapons and maybe some tools for the bunnies to handle, not only the leader. There is a 4-pack with much cheaper price per copy, however.\nSuggestions:More players would be much appreciated, but the game is never really discounted a lot. Bringing more players would bring some energy to the community and the developer would have a much easier time getting new ideas and improving the overall impression of the game.\n\nThe final verdict:The idea for this game is amazing and, in my opinion, it is worth supporting the developer, although the price is a bit high for the current amount of content. Interaction with other players adds a whole new level to player experience. This game is really great at making you think how to free yourself while not raising any suspicion and, when you manage to get in charge of the robot, you actually feel rewarded and accomplished.\nThe game is well made, still missing some options and players, but is overall in great shape. I certainly recommend it.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

I'll get this said early and go into more detail after.\nIf you like online multiplayer games and want to try one with a twist like no other.\nThen OBEY is a game worth picking up immediately.\nI've been playing OBEY for 6-7 months now before it arrived here on Early Access on steam.\nI have 100+ hours pre-steam at least. Its been one of the most enjoyable Indie, Alpha experiences I've had.\nOBEY has a one man development power house. Who is passionate about his game. He works on fixes and has been updating the game often with fixes and balances pre-steam and that trend continues here on early access. I have seen this game grow into something incredible and its great to finally see it in a place where more will have access to it.\n\nLets get onto the game and its mechanics.\nOBEY IS an asymetrical multiplayer game. Its not skill based in the way that most multiplayer games are. Twitch reflexes wont help you here. Its more about working out your enemies strategies, their game plans while also working to control your opponents to make them obey you to help you win the game.\nI'll break it down more simply.\nIt works best 4-8 players in my opinion.\nIts in a sense free for all. (altho an alliance system is planned for the future)\nSo you all start out as cute little bunnies. The goal of the game is to reach $10000\nAs a bunny it is difficult to earn money. Thats ok because there is a appartment block sized robot in the map armed with a minigun the size of a school bus.\nNow as the robot, which you can enter by walking in a door at its base you will earn money more quickly.\nYou can call a drop ship. Which will allow you to buy supplies to help you earn more money and defend yourself with ammunition and other items to help you keep control of the robot. The robot is only able to drop these supplies on the map. He has to get the other players to feed him these items. Which will take good leadership and control. A happy bunny is a less likely to subvert you. Now as a bunny. You can choose to either OBEY you're leader or Subvert him.\n\nI have done some videos which will give you a better idea oh how this works.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=447068748\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=447068752\n\nBut yes if you wanna label an number score on it, It'd be 10/10 / 100% / 2 Thumbs Up.\nIndie Game of The Year Contender.\nThis is even better with friends. 4 Packs are available and recommended in my opinion.\nIt works really well with strangers also. Its interesting working different people's strategies out.\n\nThere is a detailed wiki and an active ever growing community.\nJoin us.\nI OBEY you to.\n\n\n","May 31, 2015","true","12.7"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","14","15","3","0"

Wondering what the purpose of life even was.\nHere they were, nomming on grass. And one little bunny wondered off curiously.\nHe then found what appeared to be a giant robot with an enormous minigun attached to the front. Along with that, arms that when given the correct resources will shoot out missiles. Oh.. And a fuel tank that when given fuel, can shoot out giant bursts of fire towards the given target, or in this case, bunny.\nAnyways, back to the story.\n\nThis wondering bunny saw a huge metal door that had a little crack in the middle. He stepped on forward as the giant robots light was beaming down at him, making a loud noise. And as he curiously went into the little slit, he then began riding an elevator to the top of the Robot. He realized he was at the robots control center. He stepped up off of the elevator and onto the control platform. He then took control of the giant robot and looked around for his friends, he found them and commanded them to group up together in the middle of the field.\nHe then saw a button that was marked "Dropship = $$$$" and then he pressed it.\nUpon pressing it he noticed a countdown timer starting from 60 seconds, he looked out into the horizons and saw a another beam of light. It was the dropship! He knew he could take advantage of this. He saw other buttons marking items to purchase. He bought a few collars to manage his friends as he took full control of the situation. He then bought uranium to make him some money. The dropship finally arrived after counting down from 60 and dropped loads of uranium down onto the middle of the field. The 'drop zone'.\nHe then ordered the bunnies to proceed loading the uranium into a glowing green box that was marked "Feed Box".\nAt first his old 'friends' refused. They wanted to be paid too.\nSo the bunny at first raised the auto-pay to 25%. 3 bunnies began loading. A fourth bunny refused to load any uranium unless he was given full pay.\nThe overlord robo bunny denied the request, and instead killed him with the minigun and sent him to the dropship.\nThe bunny was angry and was wanted revenge.. In those 60 seconds of the dropship on it's way back to the dropzone to drop off more supplies, he plotted.. He plotted to uproot the overlord (his old best friend) and take over from there.\nYou may ask why..\nWell. Nobody knows why.\nIt's just..\nIn their nature.\n\nThe robosuru bought the dropship rebel bunny a pointer and a collar. He offered a deal with the rebel who wanted full pay.\nThe deal was simple.\nIf the bunny would watch over the gate in case any other bunnies tried to subvert him, he would pay. Handsomely, might I add. Not as much as full pay, but a lot more than what the other bunnies were making.\nThe cute little bunny accepted this duty. He grabbed the pointer and put on the collar then went on to being just in front of the robot.\nThe overlord knew he should be trusted.. As he knew that the bunny would want to be paid more than the rest.\nLittle did the overlord know that the other bunnies could see just exactly how much money the overlord was making. They got really upset and demanded 75% autopay for turning in uranium and other supplies, such as fuel or rockets.\nThe robot gave them 75%. The guard bunny was mad at the auto pay and also noticed how quickly the robots money went up every second. By the hundreds.. Meanwhile he'd get paid only a fraction of what the robot made.\nSo the guard quickly made his way to the gate, only a few feet away and got in. "Yes! I subverted the bunny and now I can make a ton of money!" He said, actually squeaking down to the others. He then assumed position and control over the entire robot, the old bunny who was in charge now in the dropship, awaiting arrival.\nThe new overlord then said "You. In the drop ship. You will do EXACTLY what I say. No asking for better pay. You are mine now. I own you."\nThe bunny knew he didn't have any other choice.

Three came back to the drop zone. 1 took off his collar and loaded it into the feed box without the overlord noticing.\nQuickly the bunny who took off the collar ran out into the field while the overlord was watching over the three other bunnies;\nHe made his way to the front gate of the robot and stepped in.\nOnly for the cycle to begin once more...\n","May 30, 2015","true","31.5"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","19","24","8","0"

The way you win is by earning cash, by controling the robot, or obeying the robot and they pay you. As the bunnies you go around, collecting and building for the robot. However, you can do stuff to lower the robots score if you dont get caught like dropping corpses in the delivery box. You can also take over the robot, if they dont notice you. However, if the Robot does see you, they can kill you.\n\nNow as the Robot, your job is to keep your bunnies in check. You can see them if they are wearing a collar, if not you will want to keep and eye on them. You have various weapons on your robot, a giant gun, rockets and a flamethrower. All which require ammo that your bunnies, must bring to you. You buy items via a drop ship, be warned tho bunnies can make it crash so make sure its all ready in its landing phase before you fill it up. So pretty much you tell your bunnies what to do and if they dont you kill them :).\n\nWould I recommend this, Yes. If the dev is playing they are really helpful to new players.

Words can't do justice for this game because you can't truly describe the simplistic complexity or bringing items from the drop off to the feed box. Regardless of where your standing is there is always an undercurrent of tension as you don't truly know who is winning until someone does. On top of the in general fear of the robo there is a fear of teamwork. You can make plans with someone just to have them stab you in the back for extra money. Likewise any comment made during the game could be truthful or a lie to try and get ahead. They could be warning you that someone is going to take control, or they could just be trying to distract you in order to make you lose. One game I decided I would respond to people pretending i was someone else. i ended up confusing the robo so much that on 9 different occasions he killed the player he thought was me and i ended up just getting farther ahead. This game has a somewhat steep learning curve but the entire community is incredibly helpful and new players are quickly acclimated to the sometimes hour long continuous power struggle that is OBEY.\n\nP.S.

While you can set up a local server and play alone against bots, due to the nature of the game you won't get the "real" experience until you play it with actual human beings far more capable of treachery than any AI can provide. Also, while not a hard requirement, a microphone is highly recommended to be able to communicate effectively with others.\n\nBeing a socially shy person, I find it a lot more fun to play with friends rather than strangers over the net.

I would like a "Practice" menu option that would drop me in a local game with bots.\nWhile having the possibility to run a dedicated server is a definitive plus, I would like to be able to simply host a game from the UI instead of having to manually start/stop an external server.\nThat being said, the developer seems to be active in the community and has been quick to respond to suggestions and bug reports.

You can either play in this huge bot that can ask the bunnies running around to OBEY and trust you, so you won't shoot them. But they can also lie to you and trick you into thinking they will help you and take over the robot.\n\nThe whole goal is to get to 10,000 points, depending on how you pay out using the robot or by getting paid as a bunny on the battlefield; it can get really tricky. Using a microphone is part of getting the most out of this game, since you can talk to everyone on the server and potentionally give them tasks or they can tell you something, and bamn, they either will subvert you or go with what you ask. But only one player can win, and that is whoever achieves 10,000 points.\n\nI recommend this game with a small con against it, it's tutorial is simple and may need more polishing and a little more handholding to give you a better understanding of the game before you start playing on a live server. It tries to break down what each mechanic does, but it's not in depth. This is a social game and you can play with bots, but the most fun is when playing with real players.\n\nThe game also has it's charm, since you can either play a bunny or a huge bot that kills the bunnies or helps them. Overall I think with some more polish on the tutorial and a bigger player-base this game has all the qualifications of a fun multi-player only game.\n\nAlso Dez (the developer) really wants to help the community either learn his game and/or get feedback to better his game and get the most out of his project. I will definitely be coming back to this game as more patches and more content gets in place. I would love to try a new tutorial when Dez has time to work on it.","November 24, 2015","true","2.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

Obey seems to take the key components of each and effortlessly sews them into a mix of death, disaray, and deceit.  While early access should be considered a gamble, i judge this game with immediacy in mind; it being a complete experience in its current form.\n\nThe gameplay consists around each player starting as a meager rabbit vying for profit and the end goal of obtaining 10,000$ to win the game. Once the map has begun, the rush to robot occurs. The player who first makes it into the Robot will take control, thus begining his cycle of tyrany. From there, it is the other players goal to overthrow him by reaching the entrance of the robot and taking it for themselves. Both the rabbits and robot have have means to make or even steal money, so it may not be wise to emediatly bet all your eggs on making it to the robot.\n\nIn the means of presentation , the game consists of very fluent audio design with a pastel aesthetic to fit. In terms of performance, the game runs at a consistent 60fps (Likely currently capped, as i do not dip over or under). Currently there is not a large community that plays the game consistantly so finding a game may require so wait time and a bit of scheduling to get a larger game. Overall, this is a game i would advise anyone to atleast keep an eye on if you are into ideas as asymetry or deceit.","July 10, 2015","true","4.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/346970/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA fairly unique multiplayer game of being a Bunny and trying to take control of a giant gun and earn power and money using a combination of honesty, deception, obedience, mutiny, servitude, manipulation, lying, cheating, stealing and all the other C.V. ruining human traits. It's the first Steam release from an American developer with a brief history in game art and development, and comes with a unique mix of gameplay elements which sometimes make for really interesting player interactions and psychological situations.\n\nAfter playing for just a couple of days I found myself beginning to analyse people mid-conversation in my day to day life, wondering if they were lying to me about trivial things for monetary gain, half-expecting them to hide in a piece of furniture and rush at me when I wasn't watching. It's a game which undoubtedly gets in your head when you play too much.\n\nFull disclosure: I have no affiliation with the developer, but did recieve a key.\n\nConsisting of a medium sized map with up to 10 Bunny players, the sole objective in OBEY is to amass as much money as possible, but the methods for accomplishing this vary based on the current player:power scenario and can shift in an instant. One central gun/watchtower called the Robosaru exists per map, a Power Plant which generates money for the player inside the Robosaru, and a Feed Box where Bunnys can deposit items to generate money for the Overlord, and usually make money for themselves in the process.\n\nWhoever commands the Robosaru has a distinct advantage in the form of 10x passive income, and of course deadly control, but it comes at the cost of everyone trying to steal that control either through direct attacks, or by lying, manipulating and sabotaging the Overlord or any combination of their fellow Bunnys in persuit of their own paycheck. Because it becomes increasingly difficult to watch more than a Bunny or two, the Overlord must work together to keep himself safe, similarly Bunnys want to stay alive and profit more, which means that the dynamics constantly change based on how many players are in the game, how much money they have, what they're assumed attitude towards each other is, and what they actually accomplish.\n\nHighlights\nAt a higher level OBEY about out thinking your fellow players. In the early stages I routinely found myself asking for more money for performing actions, and being a sort of salesman for myself. When I learned that I could cheat my fellow Bunnys by lying about their actions, a new avenue of options opened up. This lack of strict limitation and the utility of psychological warfare via spoken commands and text brings the gameplay to a higher level than simply running around trying to earn money and directly sabotage the current winner, and it's where the game shines.\n\nThe visual style is also very worth pointing out. Maps tend to be very simple, and I personally love the low polygon approach to the assets. The animations and movement are also well correlated with the visuals, and having a group of Bunnys all turn their heads to stare at me in the hull of a gloomy-lit ambient Dropship ended up being far more creepy than it rightfully should've been.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nBeing in Early-Access, technical issues are less of an issue and though I had a few small technical problems every single one of them was mentioned on the development panel as currently being worked on. There are still technical issues worth bringing attention to though, like lag and server drops which are common. The server console is fairly flat and bland and utilizes an IRC channel which comes with pros and cons, and the server client for hosting your own games is completely unmentioned in game, and I only found it through a mention on the website.\nThere's also a real lack of options for play just now. There are a handful of dedicated servers with various configurations, and each round has a small pool of maps to select from, but there's currently only a couple of US server and maybe a handful in the EU, so if your ping isn't particularly good you're probably going to be limited to a server or two at best, and if you're inexperienced or looking for different gameplay types, you're going to be waiting for far too long to connect to a good server.\n\nWhich brings up the biggest problem with this title: the lack of players. It's great fun when there are enough people around, and genuinely addictive and intense gameplay takes place, especially with people you know, but currently the community is only really palpable during a very specific set of hours and if you know more than a handful of players then you're unlikely to play with people you haven't mostly already seen. This wouldn't be a problem in most games, but here if you know what to expect from a player or they remember what you did the last few games, there's probably a disadvantage for one of you and a bias towards the same gameplay unfolding.\n\nI expect this game to grow over time, and it's a game more than any other I've found that will become better with a larger community in place, so it's a real problem when there's no effort to grow the player base other than perhaps a Steam group and the developer forums. While the current community is definitely great fun to play with, and well in tune with the spirit of the game, it's still both drastically dependent upon, and lacking in players.\n\nRecommendations\nYou can pick up OBEY just now for £10.99/14.99€/$14.99 or your regional equivalent, and the 4-Pack option saves you a chunky 40% if you have a couple of friends. As with all multiplayer games, your value for money is subjective based on how much you're likely to play, but when compared to other popular multiplayer titles on Steam, this is priced on the higher end, though it doesn't have in-game purchases or DLC to worry about.\n\nWhile finding people to play with can be an issue, if you expect the player base to grow then this is a fair buy, and good value for money if you go for the 4-Pack option. If you need a good multiplayer scene then you might want to wait til after release, for a sale, or until the player levels reach a better level.\n\n* The developer previously released a number of small tools and games on various platforms, including a Map Editor for the Unity Engine[lfagames.com] which includes remnants of the assets used in OBEY\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/346970/","August 18, 2015","true","11.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Well he is kinda, but you'll see, in fact he isn't\n\nSo, now to the actual review\n\nThe game is currently in Early Access, but stable, constantly patched and fixed and perfectly playable.\n\nThe game concept is very innovative and interesting, letting you do things that you wouldn't be able to do in real life but would like to do (threatening, bribing, manipulating, lying in general, denying, negotiating with the other players ("Bunnies") and so on).\n\nThe goal of the game is to get a certain amount of money before the others do. There is always one player controlling the giant Robot, controlling weapons that could kill you instantly. But as Overlord (the guy in the robot), you only see what happens in a small area where your spotlight is directed to, and you have to zoom all the way in in order to spot such a small bunny. Just killing the bunnys is not an option in most cases because there would be a respawned bunny knocking on your front door soon. Thus, you will have to effifiencly opress and controll your Bunny slaves to prevent a munity and win the game. If a bunny manages to close to the robot, he will take it over and you will get a little Bunny slave of the mighty Overlord.\n\n2 things you should know:\n1) This game is less about hiding from the Overlord than often assumed. Of course, you can, but most of the time it's more efficient to earn some money under the eyes of the Overlord.\n\n2) The Overlord is often considered to be "Overpowered" and unbeatable once he is in charge. However, the Overlord depends on the other bunnies' cooperation, an unmarked bunny roaming around on the map is the worst nightmare of an Overlord. Looking for such a rebellious bunny is like searching drawers for money to spend on Steam games during a blackout in your neighbours house.\n\n##Hey you, you know what that is like, right?\n\nAlso, the Overlord often only gets second or third, because the Overlord' property like his beloved Dropshit constantly gets wreckt and he has to rebuy it. And he can't even shoot those rebellious, hiding bunnys anymore because he ran out of rockets and has to convince a bunny to get some for him.\n\n\nSome tactics I invented for little bunnies.\n\n\n>As a little slave bunny, you could use the goodwill of the Overlord to win the game.\n\n>You could bribe other players for whatever reason...\n\n>You could be a snitch and tell the Overlord the position of your fellow hiding slave bunnies to eventually get rewarded by him.\n\n>Yould hide corpses in the bushes near the feed box and drop them into the box when the overlord is not watching.\n\n>Yould lie to the Overlord and confuse him by saying "there is someone at your door" or use him to get rid of your fellow bunnies ("he just tried to hide your Uranium behind the rock" or "he was stealing my money please do something about it I won't work anymore otherwise") so on.\n\nYou could place some of the unremovable alarm boxes at heavily frequented spots, the continous alarms will annoy the Overlord pretty quickly.\n\n>You could distract him while another one secretly sneaks up to the robot. And after this munity, claim the robot yours because you actually were hiding behind a rock close to the robot all the time and left your collar (detectable by the Robot) behind another rock far away and the overlord thought you were hiding there in the back.\n\n>You could incite a new player to (unintentionally) destroy the Overlords valuable Dropship and drop corpses into the feed box, essentially stealing the Overlords money while he is occupied with his beloved dropship destroyed by a rebellious bunny who claims it was an accident.\nThese were only some ways to win I (invented) in my 2-3 hours playtime. As you can think, the possibilities are near endless already, and the game has just entered early access !!. With friends or some random guys it's incredible fun. The Dev is very friendly and is really dedicated to the game, so make sure you get it!\n\nRating: 10/10 I am a good bunny I swear","May 27, 2015","true","9.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

If you were unfortunate to get into the tower first, you now either obey the leader or sneak your way in to the tower to gain supremacy.\n\nEnvironment and Design  – It seems that the game only features one specific sandbox map all throughout the game. And the graphics are simple but don't let that fool you, as this game\n\nControls  – The controls are basic just like any other game, and you also have the option in the main menu to do a tutorial.\n\nConclusion  – This is not your typical multiplayer game wherein players are sent in a sandbox to hunt down each other endlessly. No, this game is about showing who's the boss and make other players obey you... And then you shoot those who aren't following your orders. It is highly recommended that you get this game together with your friends, as you'll have a frustrating time waiting for people to fill up some server.","December 5, 2015","true","4.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Your purpose in the scary little world you're in is to follow orders - except when you'd rather not. Sounds a little confusing I suppose. But basically you could be an obedient little worker bee and keep big brother happy, or you could pretty much do anything you want as long as you don't get caught. Talking to the other players in this game is a big part of the experience, and the push to talk and push to mute options built into the game work very nicely. The atmosphere created by the dark environment, the flood lights, and the rodents fragility is Orwellian, I found myself thinking about old school Sci-Fi books. The Robot is a lot like big brother, something in the game also kept making me think of Asimov, though I'm not sure what. On the whole the game is very good at pulling you in, just alt tabbing from it feels like you're going to another world.\n\nThat said, it's not easy figuring out what you want to do in the game, and if you ignore the tutorial like I did (you really shouldn't), you'll just find yourself working like an obedient little sheep, and you'll miss out on all the hidden little things you can in the game. (Tip: try crashing the carrier, the little marshmallow in a campfire explosions are worth it)\nTechinically the game has a goal and a win condition, but it's not enforced, and I like that.\n\nPros: Stable on PC and Mac\nSimple concept, very easy to get started in, but has a lot of fun little secrets to discover\nNice Engine\nNice sound and visual effects; great lighting\nCons: The tutorial failed to grab my attention.\nThis is a social game, and if you're the kind of person who would rather play GMod, than solo grind a single player game, then you'll enjoy OBEY.\n\n7/10 a great game if you want to mess around with your friends.","November 21, 2015","true","2.3"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

To become a decent player, you have to understand when to be a loyal bunny and when to revolt. How to take advantage of the terrain and the actions of the other bunnies to enact your revolution. How to keep track of your bunnies as an overlord, keeping them busy and earning you money, while simultaneously keeping an eye out for bad bunnies trying to subvert you. How to manage a corpse-factory, and how to hide weapons from the overlord.\n\nTo be a great player, you need to understand the different playstyles and behaviours of the other bunnies in your group. Is bunny A a generous or mean overlord? Are they a loyal bunny, or do they run away at the first opportunity? As an overlord, do they focus on the loyal bunnies, the feedbox, their door or the environment? What are their search-patterns?

You either play as a harmless bunny or a killer robot.\n\nAs a robot you command a bunch of bunnies (vocally or via text/on-screen commands). Bunnies have to bring you (robot) ammo, fuel, batteries, etc and do tasks like building defenses around you. You reward them by paying salary.\n\nAs a bunny you must obey your robot overlord… or not. Robot has a “money generator” and you can sabotage robot’s income by turning generator off. There are other ways to ruin robot’s day. Most importantly, if you are sneaky enough, you can get inside the robot yourself and become the new overlord :) If you don’t obey and act fishy robot will send you to sweet bunny heaven in an instant.\n\nIt is a roleplaying game in sense that everyone has to play a role (there is no inventory, experience or anything like that). Quality of gameplay highly depends on the ability of players to be able to embrace their roles. Headset certainly makes communication more fun.\n\nI applaud the developer for trying something unique rather than using Unity engine to make another minecraft clone and I do hope this game becomes successful enough for the servers to get populated. At this moment community is very small and there are barely any people playing.\n\nPros:\nVery unique concept.\nGood visuals and sound.\nFriendly community and developer.\nCons:\nNo singleplayer (playing with bots is pointless).\nAmount of “fun” depends on who you play with.\nNot enough players at the moment.\nA copy of the game was provided for reviewing purposes.

You are a bunny, that is trying to gain control over a huge dictating robot on the map. Once in control you try to convince other "bunnies" (players) to follow your orders. You win by collecting the most money.  But beware for some bunnies might disobey you and will try to take control over the robot themselves, so be on your guard.\n\nAny bunny can take control over the robot, by just entering the front door, but when you control the robot, you have a few weapons at hand to protect yourself, like a flamethrower, sentries and a minigun. The downside is that other bunnies supply you with ammunition for these weapons.\n\nIt doesn't mean that you can only win the game by entering the robot, you can even win by never setting foot in it, by cleverly picking what materials to deliver to the feed box. Not every player that controls the robot is vicious or cruel, some might rule with a benevolent spirit and choose to share the wealth with the hardworking bunnies. That's what makes every game completely different and utterly fun.\n\nThis game has so much depth, just writing a mere review doesn't do it justice, it should be experienced from first hand by playing.\n\nThis game is just a big mindfak.

In each match you start off by playing a Bunny and in the arena there is a large looming tower that can be controlled by one player. You have a choice as to how you choose to play. The player who controls the tower issues commands to the other players and then they can choose whether or not you want to obey (hence the name!) those commands or not. You might want to obey the commands from the tower and play the game that way, or you might try to rebel and take over the tower!\n\nThe game play is very strategic, especially if you manage to get control of the tower. There are a ton of items in the game arena that can be used in different ways and add a huge amount of depth to the game. You'll certainly need to play through the tutorial but this isn't enough really. This is still in Early Access so hopefully the tutorial will be expanded in the future but in the meantime I'd recommend watching some Youtube videos to get a better idea of how it works.\n\nYou can play on a LAN using a private server or you can join an online one.

The goal of the game is to be the guy (or should I say bunny) with the most cash after the time ends, or be the first one to reach 10000$.  There plenty of ways in achieving this. You can get money for helping the Master (a bunny who managed to get into the giant robot), getting bribed by the master to give away your fellow bunnies and their positions, or you can subvert the Master and have all the power in your hands, getting the most money this way. As a bunny there are plenty of ways to subvert the Master (I am not gonna explain each way since you can go and discover them, but the most common technique is the art of deception. You see all bunnies have collars that give away their position, but you can get rid of them behind a rock for example and leave the area, this will make the Master believe that you are behind that rock). As the Master your job is far from easy. You have to keep track of 3 or more bunnies (depends on the players on a server), while trying to make money. Now keeping track of a bunny is really hard, cause the Master can only see bunnies that are on his spotlight, making it impossible to control 3 or more at a time. Last but not least, the developer of the game is only one man, but he is really friendly and is on almost 24/7 to teach new players.\nOverall the game is really fun and unique. I believe it's worth every cent. The only bad thing that I found is that there are very few players. Now of course this will change as the game is only 8 days old, but if you are reading this, get the game be part of the fun community and subvert your Master.","May 29, 2015","true","1.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The goal is to make 10000 points (and mecha bunny gets 10x more than regular bunnies per second).

The fun in this game is not necessarily in winning, but in actually playing it too, I feel proud even when I'm just in second or third place, which is perfectly okay with me, there's a few mechanics not explained in the tutorial though.\n\n"Corpsing" is perhaps the most major mechanic, if you are killed by a laserwall or flames then you will leave a corpse, if you drop this corpse into the feederbox the robosaru will lose a fairly significant amount of money, so it gives incentive for the robosaru to be very careful, oh and it's also possible to destroy corpses by shooting them as the Robosaru, so you don't have to worry about a whole ton of rabbits running corpses constantly, though they probably will try to do so anyway if you give them reason to.\n\nCollars increase your money gain per in-game tick from 2 to 6, and provided you have a kind but controlling overlord, also lets him/her keep easy track of where you are and, if particularly kind, the robosaru might even give you extra money for ratting out runners and such.\n\nPlaying the tutorial is heavily reccomended, and do also understand that other bunnies are also people, there will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s regardless of what you do.\n\nThe only negative point I have with this game is that, as a european player OUTSIDE of Germany, at the time of writing this, there does not seem to be a single other person in Europe playing this game that is not german/speaking only german and nothing else.","June 8, 2015","true","9.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Here we find ourselves in the skins of fluffy white rabbits.\n\nSo, what's the whole point of the game? Quite simply, for the victory you need to collect as much gold. In this hard deal, we got help of large cannon that is located in the center of the map. Naturally the one who gets to the gun can do all that he wants, and will receive 10 times more gold. At high firepower of weapon, we can made to work the entire island for us. Of course, you can overthrow the ruler rabbit and take his place, but it will be relatively difficult.

It's the first Steam release from an American developer with a brief history in game art and development, and comes with a unique mix of gameplay elements which sometimes make for really interesting player interactions and psychological situations.\n\nAfter playing for just a couple of days I found myself beginning to analyse people mid-conversation in my day to day life, wondering if they were lying to me about trivial things for monetary gain, half-expecting them to hide in a piece of furniture and rush at me when I wasn't watching.

The tutorial seems necessary to play the game, but it's simple. The game settings has pretty much everything, like changing the sound and mic level and controls.\n\nI don't think I've come across any bugs, and there has been a good variation with the randomly generated maps. The music and sound effects are nice, and there isn't too much of it, so it won't interfere with player to player communication.\n\nAlthough you can technically play alone with some AI bots, it's meant to be played with other people. In my opinion it's funniest playing with both people and AI, since you can try to blend in and then do something sneaky when the master robot isn't looking. It might take some time figuring out what methods works best for you, like obeying commands and then switch to being naughty when it pleases you.\n\nI only have good things to say about it, so I'm not sure whether more features should be added.

Each player is dumped into the map as a harmless bunny/sheep creature whose only abilities are to pickup or drop items and perform an astonishing 1cm high jump + "squeek" combo of cuteness. There is a huge opportunity for personalising characters with accessories here, which is one of the many updates currently planned.\n\nThe gameplay is essentially defined by the actions of the players in the match in question, but I guess you could describe the overarching type as a strategic game of power accumulation. The winner is decided by who reaches $10,000 first. The way in which they achieve that is up to them and the other players.\n\nA match usually begins with a mad dash to the giant robot/tower, whose occupant has a variety of extra actions available to them. If they play their cards right, they can make the other players collect resources for them which converts to money for both players. If they fail to carefully watch their subordinates, they can find sneaky ways to detract power and money or even overthrow their control of the robot.\n\nThis is where the unique gameplay mechanics come into play. As controller of the robot, the game provides some generic warnings and instructions to place on the map for your subordinates, but the real gameplay takes place through chatting with the other players, demanding one thing or offering payment for colecting resources or making demands on threat of violence (gun turret, flamethrower, rockets).\n\nAs an online-only game (there are A.I bots that work properly, but for me the fun was completely lost without human players), the availability of friends/strangers to play with will make or break your experience with OBEY. I would highly recommend purchasing a 4-pack with some friends or finding a group to play with.\n\nThe presentation is simple but looks nice and everything seems to be very well optimised. Even though the game is in early access, I didn't encounuter any sort of bugs or glitches.","December 11, 2015","true","3.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

And you still get scorched to ashes, annihilated with miniguns or shattered into pieces by rocket explosion. A serious game about decision making, following or being following, betrayals and loyalty with a hint of sneakiness. Aside that you take role of a cute guinea pig bunny with some insatiable lust for money and ravage.\n\nNow, skipping the lyrical part, game is quite good generally. Game concept where you are supposed to behave in a cat-and-mouse way, with application of being more of an armed watcher tower ["cat"], who supervises his minions and guiding them to earn more benefits, while punishing those who dare to act suspicious with death penalty, - is quite rare to meet in the industry. If I am to describe this game in short, your winning condition will to gain 10 000$ prior to any other player by any means possible, which is either obeying the tower - "boss" and working hard to bring goods in a box to gain money both for the tower and yourself, or devote yourself to rebellion and try to overtake control over the tower, and become the "boss" yourself. Tower, in fact, must observe other bunnies and try not to miss any sneaky rambos [described in a previous sentence]. Not to say, you can't figure who is who unless you want to learn people's personal behaviour and mark them in-mind.\n\nThere aren't any critical issues and I didn't happen to meet anything what could distort my experience even slightly. For the mechanics, rabbits are moving really slow while map is rather big, but such does the tower, which only has a tiny illuminated area to see over the map.  Music is neat, controls are intuitive too. There could be some better explanation guide, aside from the starting tutorial, but it's easy enough to figure on your own during your first playthough (harder with bots though, ouch).\n\nSo far game is dedicated to reach its full potential only in online mode, and sadly said, it's almost dead by the time. Good part is that there are bots to replace real players, but this way the "drama part" of interaction and cooperation within a small group of bunnies goes to the second plan, leaving in most times meaningless world for you to toy with. So, I'd strongly advise you to found a party, or seek for random people on forums, to truly enjoy the game. Also, people say that devs are often present in-game, helping beginners and leading them through sometimes puzzling aspects of the game, which is a nice touch and really good attitude towards community. I am pretty sure too that there are more updates to come, with new modes, items, mechanics and improved AI (and bigger base of players), so that may be the point where you decide to give this game a try.\n\nWell, this ends my review. I may have been subjective at points and didn't cover some of the in-game details, but still want to describe what I felt and found enjoyable while playing OBEY - small, mostly online based match game where you either seek for the power, stand for equality or go with the flow, else doing all of this at once.\n\n----- 7 one-millimeter-high bunny jumps out of 10. ------","December 10, 2015","true","4.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The first person there takes over the robot and becomes the master.  Being the master can be a double-edged sword, because while you do make a ton of money, the bunnies under your heel have many ways to make you lose all of it very quickly.  The best part about this game is that it's very possible to NEVER be in the robot and still win.\n\nOne game I was playing, one player was in the robot for the majority of the game.  He had 8,000 points and climbing (you need 10,000 to win) while everybody else was at about 3,000 or less.  I spent some of my points to buy laser walls, an item that sets up a deadly trap that kills any bunny that touches it.  When my compatriots and I were delivered back to the game via dropship after being killed, two of my rivals foolishly decided to make a break for the robot.  While the robot was distracted with annihilating them, I ran into an area the robot couldn't see and set up my trap.\n\nNow, the interesting part in this game is that a dead bunny's corpse significantly lower's the robot's score when delivered to the robot's delivery area.  The robot can get resources (missiles, flamethrower fuel) and points if bunnies deliver items there, but delivering a dead bunny lowers their score quite significantly.  I committed suicide on the trap I had set up outside of the robot's vision about half a dozen times, then delivered my bunny's charred remains over and over.  The guy that was moments away from winning and had been in the robot the entire game now had negative points and couldn't afford to bribe other players into doing his bidding.  Every single bunny in the game (except me) then spent their points to overload the dropship and crash it, which causes dead bunnies to spawn at random points on the map instead of being delivered to a fixed area (at least until the ship is replaced, which is expensive).  Now there was an uprising and the robot changed hands quite a few times.\n\nNobody found out about my trap and corpse-making machine.  Every single time someone new got in the robot, I destroyed their score and rose through the ranks until I was in the lead.  I never obeyed the robot but I never tried to take over either.  I ended up winning that particular match because I kept committing suicide over and over, then pulling off heists and stealthily avoiding the robot's gaze.\n\nNo other game I've ever played offers an experience like that.  This game is phenomenal, and the developer regularly logs in to teach new players about the game (he's also an evil dictator when he's in the robot, don't listen to him).  I highly recommend anybody that's interested in a more intellectual and socially interesting game to give it a try.","May 28, 2015","true","27.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

I originally had mixed feelings about this game due to a relatively poor tutorial, but once I managed to understand how OBEY is truly played, it became a blast. The two-faced style of gameplay can lead to some hilariously memorable moments. A couple words of advice before purchasing this game. The player base is still relatively small, and that is something that can only be remedied with you and your friends’ help. The purchasing format heavily discounts a 4-pack purchase. If you decide to go in on OBEY, I would recommend getting some friends in to help with a 4-pack purchase.\n\n==== First Impressions ====----11/25/2015----\nThere are two positions you may take part of when starting the game. You may play as a cute little bunny, scheming, plotting and looking for ways to overthrow the evil overseer controlling the robot of doom while maintaining a very obedient front in order to survive. Alternatively, you may play as the evil overseer controlling the robot of doom ensuring that those lying little devious monsters do your bidding. The main actions that the robot can take include killing the bunnies, deactivating hidden mines to help the bunnies stay alive, change pay scales in order to incentivize the bunnies to give you certain supplies (needed for ammo/security) etc. The main actions that the bunnies can perform include purchasing and feeding supplies to the robot, setting up security for the robot, warning the robot of bunnies making a break for the robot control room, or make a break for the robot control room.\n\nCoordinating is much easier using a microphone. Although there are forms of communication without it, warning the robot of bunny locations can be difficult.\n\n==== Current State of the Game ====There were no noticeable bugs found in my short play through, however there are couple important suggestions I feel if implemented will help improve the gameplay.\n\nSuggestions: Include basic strategies in the tutorial/provide a better understanding of the actions you can perform as a bunny/robot. It took a few gameplay videos to get the grasp of how to play\nImprove communication options for those without a microphone\nMake a cute little introduction cut scene/animation explaining the bunnies’ predicament\n==== Hardware Information ====HardwareTypeMonitor720p 32 LED TVControllerDS3 (M&K used for this review)MotherboardASRock Z97M AnniversaryCPUi5-4590GPURadeon R9 290XRAM8 GBOSWindows 7\n==== Disclaimer ====A copy of this game was provided by the developer: Dan Dez; however, this did not bias my review in any form.","November 25, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

At first it may seem a bit boring and you may be wondering what to do. I would definitely recommend leaching on to an experienced player so that they can show you the ropes. There are a lot of tactics and things you may not realise you can do at first which will effect the score drastically. The idea of the game is to earn points and the highest score wins the round. You can either be a bunny or a robot although I never hot a chance to be a robot as it seems to be quite difficult to become the robot. As a bunny you can either obey the robot and follow its commands or you can rebel and try and knock points from the robots total. The robot can blast you to smithereens with a variety of arsenal so you risk certain death rebelling. I really enjoyed the bright colourful graphics and the sounds, especially the explosions. The bunnies are very cute if not a bit stupid and slow. I would have liked the bunnies to be a bit more agile to give a better chance of avoiding gun fire. I enjoyed the game and enjoyed playing with other people. You get a sense of teamwork whilst plotting against the robot.

Great idea, great execution, great fun! Best EarlyA game I've played so far!\n*** Note: Headset strongly recommended! ***\n\nWell here we have an Early Access game that acually feels finished and bug-free! And the store page doesn't lie: Obey is unlike any other game.\n\nIt's a bizarre marriage of co-op and PvP at the same time - and it's hell of fun! It's both fooling around, and trying to win. Although the mechanics are fairly simple, and kind-of "easy to learn, difficult to master", there is no single "will always work", golden road to victory - depending on the situation, different strategies can work.\n\nSimply put, being a good bunny earns you cash, being the boss earns you more. Any bunny can be boss - if you manage to enter the "bosstower" alive! Bunnies make cash by feeding items to a dropbox, and can hurt the boss by feeding it trash. So you have to be a smart boss, or the bunnies will ruin you. On the other hand, the boss has a chaingun. As a bunny, your only weapon is: acting smart. If you are a smart bunny, you might win even without being the boss.\n\nThe first player to reach $10.000 wins. All this, while voice-chatting with the others.\n\nIt's about timing (but not FPS reflexes), and knowing when to work together, and when to screw the others - and about the enjoyment while doing so :) Sneaking up on the boss is so much fun, as is fooling around with other bunny mates, trying to steal their pay...\n\nI wish there was a free demo, everyone should try this!\nHighly playable, I didn't encounter any bug so far.\n\nThe price tag is a little high - I assume because the dev wanted a small, interested community while in EA. I feel like this is more of an $8 game - that said, the 4-pack is worth it if you have voice-chat multiplayer friends. If this is on sale, don't hesitate!\n\nObey a shining example of how a little team (1 guy!) can make a game that works, without resorting to season DLCs and other shenanigans - if they have a good, realizable idea, and follow it.

There's only one word I can use to describe it: chaos.\n\nYou've only got one goal: get the most money possible.\n\nIt's crazy confusing at first. The tutorial helps, but goes so fast and is still not entirely clear (the easiest ways to play are either in the lobby with bots or by looking it up on youtube). You're thrown into a field full of junk, corpses, rocket fuels, etc. You can put these items in a "feed box" going to the robot, offering them different perks and giving you a small amount of money. However, the more loyal you are, the richer the robot gets. As a bunny, there's not much you can do besides feed the robot and hope he gives you money for being loyal.\n\nNow, you can always go overthrow him and take control.\n\nThis opens up a whole new world of excitement. You have to constantly watch for disobeying bunnies attempting to steal your throne, pay loyal bunnies, order dropships with supplies for your bunnies to feed you, shoot disobeying bunnies, and much much more.\n\nOverall, it's a great game once you get the hang of it. The bots are super easy to play against, so once you know what you're doing I recommend getting with actual people to play. Mics are also extremely helpful for communication.\n","January 10","true","2.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unlike others of its kind, it doesn't really rely on a system of honor or rules ("FREEKILLER!!!"); It's carefully designed so that an inattentive or needlessly violent ruler can be easily sabotaged or dethroned. Good fun to be had betraying and outsmarting friends and strangers no matter which side you're on. A few words of warning though: voice chat is a must, be prepared to take time to learn game's mechanics/strategies, and bring some friends along or prepare to coordinate with the game's community to play for the time being.\n\nThe goal of the game is to be the first to earn 10,000¢. You earn a very slow passive income which is increased by wearing a collar or greatly by being in the robot. Taking control of the robot is simply a matter of walking in the door. The game's maps are dark and unless you're under the spotlight of the robots's sights or wearing a collar you aren't readily seen. You can also hide behind hills or under water.\n\nSo being in the robot = earning the most money = winning, right? Why not just constantly shoot all that approach your thone? Well, being in the robot only really gives you the ability to kill. In order to restock you have to order supplies, dumped onto the map by a dropship, and coerce/bribe your subordinates into dropping them into a box. Bunny corpses that are dropped into the box heavily penalize the robot overlord. Killed players respawn in the dropship and have to wait for it to arrive... unless something were to happen to the dropship :) In its absence players spawn randomly on the map; You will quickly find out how hard it is to prevent the stealthy approach of many rabbits to your door at once.\n\nThe game's site has a wiki which goes over things in much more detail. The learning curve is steep, but it's surprising just how many different strategies there are.\n\nA few negatives:\n*Controller support is only partial. You need the keyboard to fully control the robot or purchase items.\n*Uses mouse smoothing but has no option to disable it.\n*The tutorial only gives a short introduction to the game's components. It will take a lot of reading on the wiki or playing a few sessions to start to understand how to play. Some scenario-based tutorials like strategy games have might be more fun while providing practical examples instead of text.\n*The game has bots in the absence of human players, but apart from the obvious (not being able to trick you) you are unable to command them to do specific things. They're no fun.\n\nDisclaimer: I received a key for testing/review.","December 8, 2015","true","2.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Do as he says, and he will most probably reward you and distinguish you among your pairs. Disobey him, and you'll probably just fall under his machine-gun.\nNow, before you star assuming this developer has some sort of child induced fear to primates, let me tell you the twist of it all. The giant bad ♥♥♥ looking robot you see from anywhere on the map? That's actually a hamster. That's right, there's one of you just hanging in inside. That ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ got up there first to watch over you and your mates. To be the leader. One ham to rule them all.\nOf course, he can't be up there all by his own. All those fancy tech you see?

Yeah, those hams won't take it for long.\n\nThe fun of it all resides in that there's no actual clear way to play this game.\nBe a loyal feud to your master and gain his trust.\nBe a revolutionary leader and lead your pack to subversion.\nBe a loner ham or the lunatic that makes everyone's life miserable.\n\nNo matter what you choose, you'll see where the fun is.\n\nWords are plenty, and meaning hides in between.

Meanwhile, there's a giant robot -which is controlled by one of the bunnies- that "employs" the rest of the bunnies. The player can choose to obey the robot or try to overtake his or her position. So basically that's the concept.\n\nI had to play the tutorial a few times just to learn the ropes, because there are quite a few mechanics and I'm not used to multiplayer-only games... and then I found out that there weren't any players online. This has happened the three times I've tried the game, but I may have had bad luck. Luckily, there's a bot system that works pretty decently, so it's not like you can't play... but it's certainly not the way the game was meant to be played, I guess.\n\nIt's kind of fun though. The game itself is based on a cool idea and the implementation is not bad. The graphics are also quite outstanding for an indie game, I specially liked the robot. The way the giant robot looks from the point of view of our bunny is truly imposing.\n\nThe price is still quite expensive in my opinion, but once it gets a proper sale price, I guess it would be really cool to play this game with a few friends after buying the 4-Pack.\n\nAnd well, I'm not sure what other features will be implemented in the future, but the game is quite playable already. I would like, for example, to have a sprint key or being able to hide the bunny underground or something. I haven't played for too long and I already felt it was sometimes too repetitive to go from one place to another carrying stuff just to be annihilated the moment I stepped out of the "delivery path" (yup, the bots are pretty smart)\n\nI also think it would be cool if the robot had some kind of massive speaker and if it gave its orders through pre-recorded audio, rather than text. I think that would be a cool way to implement a bit more of humour into the game and for players to understand the game earlier. I mean, if I had heard "Bring me more uranium, or die!!!!!" I would have known right away what I had to do. The bots kind of already do that already through text, but I'd like to see it more often and, if possible, with audio. Just some suggestions.\n\nI'll definitely come back once more things are added to the game. Specially recommended to those that really enjoy multiplayer games in which you have to interact a lot with other players, be aware though that there aren't too many people online, so be sure to bring your friends with you!\n\nDisclaimer: I received this game for free for reviewing purposes.","November 30, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has one of the best concepts in a game that I have ever seen - it just needs polishing. As with most indie multiplayer-only games (there are bots but the experience is not the same), it is often difficult to find a match when it has just joined the market recently and is early in development. But I can say the games I have played were very fun. I've only had it for 2 days and have played 10+ hours already.\n\nThe main objective of the game is to earn the most money, and whoever gets to $10000 (default) first wins the match. Each person controls a bunny, and one player controls the robot (or "robosaru"). The robot has a range of weapons and must force the bunnies to give him more ammo, more money or snitch on other players in return for cash. The robot however earns cash must more quickly and easily than the bunnies, so to prevent them form winning the bunnies must try to sneak into the robot's door and take it over without the robot noticing.\n\nThere are much more elements of this game that play large roles in deciding who wins, such as lying, deception and other psychological and game aspects.\n\nThe game has quite a steep learning curve, and the tutorial is not very clear, but the developer (who seems very nice ;) ) is often on the servers teaching people how to play and develop strategies. That's how I learnt anyway.\n\nThe game does recommend a microphone, but so far I've done quite well without using mine all the time - maybe only using it once or twice to give long commands.\n\nOne big issue I have been having is the game having a 19/20 chance of crashing when i connect to a server. This has been found to be a problem with unity and the dev says if they do not fix it soon then he will make a workaround.\n\nDefinately consider buying this game, or at least following it to see how it develops :)","November 23, 2015","true","26.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

(Who may or may not be controlled by a bunny.)\nYou get money at the discretion of the current robot overlord. They may place down money in reward for you taking ammunition to them or for telling them that someone is trying to overthrow them! Speaking of overthrowing, if you decide that you've had enough of following orders and want to be in charge, just head to the base of the robot and hop inside! If you can avoid the robot shooting at you, traps around the tower, and other people ratting you out!\n\nThere are several more features I haven't touched on here that can benefit and hinder you, but the real fun is convincing your opponents that you're trying to help them.\n\nThis game is absolutely worth playing if you can find some friends to play with or if you just want to try something new!","December 10, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The overlord is the man behind the giant gorilla turret and can see almost your every move.  The other players are bunnies who can assist the overlord or stage a coup and try and become the gunner themselves.\n\nCurrently, the game is quite fun and look forward to the additional content that is planned for OBEY.  The art style is fitting, the controls worked as expected, and the in-game chat had no issues.\n\nThe few improvements I would like to see are a better HUD for the overlord since there are so many abilities at your disposal and a slightly more in depth tutorial (the first game I played I really didn't understand the flow of the game).\n\nTL:DR  - Fun asymmetrical multiplayer only game with a great premise and a little light on content.

You will get my honest feelings about the game (both good and bad).---\n\nThis game is simple to play but impossible to master. You will never have the same game twice and at this point in Early Access, multiplayer is a must. With that said, I would fully recommend this game to anyone looking for a great time with a few friends.\n\nThe idea is simple, be the first to 10,000 and you win. How you go about getting there is another story. You are a bunny and can either hop around following or disobeying orders as you see fit. You will receive orders from whoever is operating the "Robot". If you should choose to do so at any point and are able, you can take over running the robot which will lead to quicker point accumulation.\n\nI started with the tutorial and then played a round against the bots. I then repeated the above and thought I had it all figured out and was ready for my first game with real players... Boy was I wrong. There is a lot of things not included in the tutorial which you need to pick up in live games with real players. Games with bots (at this point) really aren't the same as with live players. Keeping in mind the game is still in early access, there aren't always a lot of players available for games all the time. The developer (Dez) is around and if he is free, he spends time teaching new players what to do in the game. There is a spectator mode where you can hear the players speaking over the mic and fly around anywhere in the level observing what is going on and I fully recommend taking advantage of this feature.\n\nThe game is very polished in its current state and with Dez continuing with updates and hopefully adding new features this game promises to be great when it makes it out of early access. Maybe new animals which have unique abilities and different game modes (I think that I was already introduced to a new game mode during the last event) will make this game even greater than it already is.","December 8, 2015","true","5.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The various in-game rules are what's left to be finished, but you can enjoy the game already. Its weakness tho is that it's online only, and although there are bots, they are mostly to fill servers up, and so playing with them alone is not viable.\n\nObey is simply a game about power. Big deal, you might think, any videogame involves power. True, but Obey pares it down to its most important aspects: what one does to acquire and maintain it, and what other people have to deal with. Due to this, the game is designed to be played live against other people, and there's no single player. Although there are bots, they are mostly to fill servers up, and so playing with them alone is not viable.\n\nEvery players starts being "created equal", as a harmless bunny capable of little more than carrying and dropping items, and you mission is to amass a pre-determined amount of cash. Somewhere nearby them is a massive, weaponized tower, as the stand-in for Authority. It's the prime source of cash, and it makes itself felt in that most primal form possible: violence. Oh, and of course, only one lucky rabbit gets to control over. You can see where this is going.\n\nThe player commanding the tower (Robosaru) can just plain kill every other bunny with little effort... except there's no point in that, as they can work for him and help him get money faster. Either with the threat of violence or financial incentives, the enemy bunnies are exploited in order to make the Robosaru player richer. But of course, that player most likely won't rule forever, and can lose his Authority if he doesn't pay enough attention to hi unwilling subjects.\n\nAnd here we have the most interesting part. Each bunny not already in the Robosaru can choose to be a loyal little worker, or try to sabotage and overthrow him. Players who choose the latter can skulk around the map and use various items to hamper the ruling bunny's flow of riches, and similarly, loyalists might get a reward by acting against a rebel. Or he might not. It's all up to the Robosaur's occupant, really. He can be ruthless or relatively benevolent, and the other bunnies might exploit that.\n\nBecause of this social element, voice chat is very important (altho players can use text messages), allowing the ruler to better express his wishes, and other bunnies to ask for favors. It might not look like much, but these conversations are essential to keep the game dynamic, and not allowing a single player to hog the Robosaur. Add to it a variety of items (laser fences, landmines, ammo for the Robosaur etc.) and the power relations can get complex.\n\nIt's only real drawback at the moment are the lack of players, but that's something that ebbs and flows. Overall, a very clever experiment on powermongering.","December 6, 2015","true","2.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You play as either a rabbit attempting to get access to a tower or the person in the tower giving the commands to the rabbits. Whoever controls the tower basically controls the playing field as long as you are good enough to micromanage the players in controls of the rabbits. As a rabbit you gain money for following orders issued by the person in the tower. You'll be issued commands to drop off cargo into the inventory of the person who controls the tower. It's basically a free for all styled game. As a rabbit you can also choose not to follow orders and attempt to take control of the tower which entails being as stealthy as possible while you cross the map. There will be obstacles on the field to hinder your way which makes it more challenging.\n\nIt's a unique game. I have definitely not seen anything else like it.

I would have liked to see an audio control when launching the game, as there already is one for the video settings.\n\nOBEY is a multi-player only game. While the servers are low-populated, the game does include bots. Something I think any MP-only game should have. In this game, every player controls a bunny. You have won when you have earned the most money out of all the players. You earn money automatically, but you can speed things up considerably by collecting clutter. Clutter give you money upon delivery at delivery points. You can only carry 2 items at a time if you're wearing a collar, or 3 times at a time if you're not wearing a collar.\n\nThen there's a giant robot on the map that can be controlled by one player. In order to take control of this robot, 'all' you have to do is walk to the door and whoever was in control of the robot (if any) will get thrown out. I put all between apostrophes because while it sounds easy, when you're playing against more experienced opponents it proves to be a lot more difficult than initially thought. That's because the person controlling the robot can kill any bunny on the map. The robot player also makes 10x the amount of money that other players make. The robot player can threaten bunnies and give them commands. Or try to keep the bunnies befriended, by rewarding them for tasks by giving them more money.\n\nSo you would think that the most logical strategy would be to sprint for the robot, take control, and kill everyone until the end of the game, right? Wrong. This is where the community aspect of it kicks in. This game is all about psychology. If you are killing everyone, why would anyone obey you? Instead, you'll see players group up and riot against you. The robot player can buy bunnies a collar, making them more visible. But bunnies can take these off and go 'rogue'. When rogue, they are still visible but it becomes a lot more difficult. Due to the terrain it is impossible for the robot player to see every inch of the map, making it possible for bunnies to get closer to the door and take over control.\n\nThis is also why you would create pacts if you're the robot player. By having loyalists telling you if they spot a rogue, it becomes easier to defend your control of the robot. But then again, someone could lie about a rogue's position distracting you from their real position. Besides that, you also have to rely on other bunnies: any clutter turned in, gets delivered to the robot player. If you notice there's a bunny at your door when they're already too close for your bullets to hit them, you can still use the flame-thrower to kill them. But in order to use the flame-thrower, you need fuel. You can buy this yourself, but you need money to win so it's preferable if a player deposits it instead. Also, when a bunny deposits a corpse, left behind when a bunny gets burned, that will cause the robot player to lose some of their money instantly.\n\nThere are a lot more items in the game that I didn't cover in this review, because it would have been too long. There are topics in the discussions section that cover all of those. What I can say about them briefly, is that the items are very diverse and well-thought about. There are mines to trick other bunnies, Lights to light up areas for the robot player, rockets as additional ammunition for the robot player and more.\n\nSo you can choose to be a cruel dictator, and grind it out if you're playing against not so skilled opponents. Or be a kind ruler, and get betrayed by a bunny eventually. Either way people, will be out to get you in order to win the game themselves. Like I said before, this game is all about psychology. It involves a lot of trickery and bargaining.\n\nThe graphics look simple, but they are done really well. It feeds the cuteness of the bunnies and their bunny world. The animations are also very nice. The sound effects, I thought, fit the game perfectly. All in all I think this is a really fun game, at its best when played with a group of friends. But as a beginner, even playing against bots were fun and challenging.","December 2, 2015","true","6.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It isn't just a massive multiplayer action packed game like many other games nowadays, the gameplay is a lot different.

Or, at the other way you just don't need to do that. You can play against his orders to lower its money, and there the action starts, if it discover you it will start killing you.

Don't get me wrong, I had a lot of fun playing around even with strangers, but I just feel that there is much more work that needs to be done before the final release!\n\nCons: First things first, the tutorial needs a complete rework, it feels like you are reading a boring manual and made me want to quit about half-way thru. Another well known problem, is that currently the player base is really small, so it is a bit hard to find real players and not simply just playing against AI, however it is to be expected of a game in Early Access.\n\nNow what is the most charming about this game (apart from the very cutsy art style) is the social / roleplaying aspect and the means of communication using only the game (No chat or voice communication) are not quite there yet. More type of pings or premade sentences should be added to enable proper communication and orders/reponse.\n\nI look forward to further updates and expecially when the player base gets bigger.\n\nDisclaimer: A free key has been provided by The Lo-Fi Apocalypse, Inc. for review purposes.

There is a tutorial in the game, but it's not enough to start playing the game which I find very odd. Only way to learn more of this game is that you need to play with the developer of the game.

That is what OBEY is truly all about. OBEY is a completely new genre.  The asymmetry combined with the player-driven gameplay make for one of the best multiplayer experiences that I have ever had on PC.  It is a competitive multiplayer action game where you play as adorable fluffy bunnies that will do everything in their power to coerce others to join their side of the battle. OBEY is so addicting that it is the type of game that I cannot put down.  Winning a game is one of the greatest experiences, and knowing that you did it all through dishonesty and deception makes it all the better.

Nor does it run on my 2010 Macbook (Non-Pro) with only 2 GB of RAM.\n\nWith that being said, here is my semi in depth review.\n\nObey is a First Person multiplayer game that sets itself apart from most by focusing on team based play. It can be played online, or with bots, though the bots tend to be pretty easy. It can seem very chaotic and difficult to understand at first, although once one masters the gameplay it gets less confusing. The game's tutorial tries to teach you how to play a little, showing you what different items do and how the game works. Gameplay is basically like a very complicated King Of The Hill, in which players feed items into a massive robot controlled by one player in order to try to earn money so then the player controlling the robot can give back more items and money to the players. In terms that a sane person will understand, to win you basically need to make the most money.\n\nOverall, the game is worth buying for people that are looking for an interesting multiplayer experience that strives to be different from your average online game.\n\nVisGaming Score  A Sloth/10\n\n(Honestly, this game would be really good, but its so slow on both my PC and my Mac, that I probably will wind up going back and playing again once I upgrade to something half decent.)","January 10","true","0.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

If there was ever a game that WTF could summarize a first impression, this would be it. But not necessarily in the way one might expect.\n\nMy "WTF" moment wasn't due to anything offensive nor was it due to nonsensical or buggy content. In fact, there's nothing offensive in it, no gore, no bad language. There are  no noticeable bugs, no fps drops, no graphic glitches or crashes.  Instead, my immediate WTF reaction was due to just how bizarre and unique this game is compared to anything else I've ever played...and that's a GOOD thing.\n\nYou are one of many in an army of bunnies, attempting to cleverly outwit both other bunnies and the "master" bunny (who takes control of a giant, stationary yet deadly robot of death). The object of the match is to merely end up with more cash than your peers. You can do the master bunny's bidding and get paid for the tasks he creates to be completed or become the "master" bunny yourself and control the deathbot (which earns you cash more quickly).\n\nDo you simply do what you are told and hope the other bunnies' greed will set them back? Do you work with a buddy to overtake the others and eventually, take control of the giant bot?  Are you willilng to backstab the others or do you insist on working as a team? Do you complete the assigned tasks to gain trust and favor from the mighty bot of doom all the while formulating and employing a master plan to overtake him and weilding the mighty power for yourself?  And if you do take control, who do you trust? Are you paying handsomely for the tasks to be completed to gain favor from your underlings even if it means they may start to catch up monetarily? Are you able to notice when a bunny starts to plot against you? Do you destroy the resistence with your mega machine gun or fry them with nepalm?  All questions that you'll be faced with in this game.\n\nDespite it's cutesy look, it's a very deep, strategic game.\n\nThere is a lot of potential here. It's still in early access. Stability wise it seems solid. I think the tutorial could use some help as right now it's more of a text based instruction and it's difficult to remember what everything is and how to use them. There's no much in way of strategy guidance either.\n\nThe biggest criticism from me about its current state is the lack of consistent players online at any given time. The weekends seem to be more active of course, but during the week, good luck finding anyone online...at all.\n\nI think easing new players into the game better will retain them. I think better marketing will open up the game's demographic. And if that happens, I think this little gem has the potential to be a sleeper hit.","November 26, 2015","true","0.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

All the players are trying to get into a robot to take control of everything on the map and give orders to other players to do what you want them to do. It's not about shooting others, it's about making them Obey your orders. This concept is so cool but in my own opinion it lacks a lot. The futuristic theme of the game and the bunnies the players take control of doesn't match the idea and the goal of the game. What if instead of bunnies there was a weak miserable dobby-like creatures. What if instead of the peaceful backyard garden the current map looks like there was a desert wasteland, a poisonous swamp or even a dark and scary place that makes the player feel like he is being enslaved.
