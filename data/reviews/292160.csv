Holy crap was that fun!! This game is like crack!\n\nControls take a bit to get used to, but once you have, they're not an issue. Only one bug I found, and that's when one of your party sees a reticulan/bad guy, the movement orders you've given up to that point can be reset if you accidentally click the next destination point right as the enemy is sighted. This won't even occur to you until you get a few rifleman with super-heroic speed that you use for ambushes anyway. If you even do.\n\nVagrant, infinitesimal issues that take nothing away from the game. This is finished and polished. Worth twice the price at least, IMO. It's not real time strategy, the game pauses each time something comes up so you can take your time to think about what to do. This, of coarse extends the life of your hardware because you won't snap under the pressure and lay waste to your game room, lol. The gameplay seems simplistic on the surface, but quicly gets very very hard and you HAVE to think up actual tactics and strategies to progress. Sometimes blitzkrieg is called for, sometimes the only way not to get wiped out is to back up against a wall, put your heavy hitters at the back and your riflemen/(handgun?)men in front on one knee and just wait for the enemy to come. (I didn't do this until late in the game unfortunately, keeping your medic in the center of your group helps ALOT when YOU'RE being blitzkrieged.)\n\nBE SURE TO QUICK SAVE AT THE START OF EVERY BATTLE, NOT DURRING!! You'll see why soon enough.\n\nI'm not sure what impresses me the most about this game, but the ballance is definitely a contender. I can't say enough just how well thought out this game is. You can't seem to research stuff fast enough, you can't seem to develope new technologies fast enough, you can never manufacture armor or weapons in time for missions that can't wait around.. You have the delegate, you have to plan, you have to crunch numbers, you have to take humiliating losses here and there, you have to give 100% But, somehow, you always JUST BARELY have what you need to get the job done. Ballance. MASTERFUL ballance.\n\nSo, in summary, if you're a bargain hunter and/or a supporter of indi games (I'm a hardcore one, myself ` La Résistance indépendant!!!) but try to get quality when you can - this is a game for you. Well, if you dig strategy games that is. This isn't so much of a veg out genere. Don't wait for it to go on sale either. It's only $7 last I looked. And hopefully if the people who made it continue to make a living doing so (they've CERTAINLY earned it), they'll crank out more great games!!\n\n{To the Devs:} THANK YOU!!

The game is dated, and a little tricky to get use to but still plays great.  It does have a 4:3 resolution, so on a widescreen monitor it stretches in fullscreen, but you can play windowed to fix this.\n\nThe 3 UFO games, all thankfully on Steam are all great, if your into Xcom or the older X-com games, you will likely enjoy this game.","April 25, 2014","true","6.2"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","42","47","0","0"

You fight to recover an Earth that has been largely depopulated by a malicious alien menace in a pausable, real-time strategy game.\n\nPROS\n+It's challenging, but not impossible. (Hint: Let them come to you sometimes! Choke points are an essential tactic later in the game!)\n+There are several different damage types which are stronger and weaker against various enemies, forcing the player to strategize and take squads that have a variety of damage types.\n+Most weapons remain relevant throughout the game--there's only a few instances where one weapon was genuinely superior to another.\n+Game has multiple endings. Three, to be exact. I can't spoil them obviously, that's not the point of a review.\n+Real-time pausable element provides an interesting twist to the usual turn-based X-COM formula.\n+Geoscape is aesthetically appealing and directly reflects how well you're performing in the war against the enemy.\n+It has a plot. With twists.\n...\nCONS\n-Level designs are fairly basic and sometimes infuriating.\n-Enemies can sometimes be spawned beside your men before you even get a chance to do anything.\n-The last couple levels show signs the game was rushed out the door.\n-The voice acting is so atrocious it's hilarious. Go to the options menu and turn off voices.\n-It has a plot. With sometimes stupid twists.\n\nIf you really need a numeric score: 7/10. Playable, fun, appealing to people who enjoy X-COM and Real-Time Strategy games.\n\nPS: If you have a widescreen monitor or are encountering technical issues, you may want to run it in a window with a couple other settings. To do this, right click on the UFO: Aftermath in Steam and select "Properties", then select "Launch Options". From there, add this: --options multisample=4 anisotropy=8 loadall=FALSE video_caption=TRUE --option fullscreen=FALSE\n\nHave fun taking back the Earth!","January 26, 2015","true","20.4"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","35","40","3","1"

It is a surprisingly good formula and provided me with enough fun that I definitely consider it to be worth the charging price.\n\nThe graphics may be outdated and the sounds may be reptitive and sub-par, but the gameplay functions are solid and the story is intriguing enough. Unfortunately the story is rather short and you spend most of the games doing generic randomized missions on maps that "randomize" slightly every go. After about 6 hours however you come to realize that the maps have limited amounts of "Randomization" as you begin to see the same maps over and over again.\n\nIf you liked XCOM you'll love this. It was equally entertaining, and with a unique type of gameplay. I give it 6/10. It was a decent game, slightly above average. Not amazing however, but definitely worth $5.","July 10, 2015","true","14.3"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

It takes all of the core ideas of the original x-com (many of which were sadly cut from Enemy Unknown) and adds a lot of meat to them. The "geopshere" world map phase of the game is particularly excellent. The aliens have a plan, and it's up to you to not only figure out what it is, but how to stop it.\nOne of the greatest improvements is that the game is "pause and play." You can pause the game at any time (and the game will automatically pause when certain events occur, like spotting an enemy), and issue orders to your squad. Every action has a timer associated with it to tell you how long it will take to complete, rather than having action points and a "you go, I go" turn-based system. Things make a lot more sense as a result, and you can plan tactics without enemies taking their turn to run across gaps or cross the map without you being able to do anything about it since it's not your turn.\nIt also lets you have multiple soldiers moving at the same time, and group-select and move orders, which means that the squad sizes and maps can be *far* larger without the game slowing to a crawl as you move an entire team one at a time down a hallway or street.\nThe one thing I really miss that was in the original xcom which is missing from UFO: Aftermath is the environmental destruction and the interesting tactical options it provided. Also, this game was significantly superior to its own sequels.","April 26, 2014","true","0.2"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","2"

Rather than the turn based combat previously seen in the likes of UFO: Enemy Unknown/Terror from the Deep etc. This is now a live RTS sytle of game often been used in more newer games such as Jagged Alliance. The combat has some cool little feature such as squad members automatically peaking around corners, and that eary feeling of trying to find that last alien.\n\nThe tutorial sets the seen, of a lonely guy called Malcolm and his trusty shotgun. After the tutorial he and one other are trust into being in charged of combating this alian threat. As the team expands, so does the technology based, from simple kevlar sytle armour to power suits. From earth based weapons to the use of alien ones or just weilding miniguns! Bewarned that this is a game best played cautiously as combat is now quick and easy, and there can be a learning curve when facing various new aliens.\n\nThe game follows a story line unlike its predecessors where the objective was getting to the enemy base. The story is basic, but there. The aliens are not your typical sectoid look with a large variety of some quite difficult species to bring down.\n\nA great new feature is the training of soldiers, though there is no determined way of controlling how stats increase, you can now train soldiers in certain specialities which align to their favoured skill. This adds another form of creating a more specialised and team with a personal touch.\n\nOn the series I personally do prefer Aftershock, where you can read my next review on why!","April 26, 2014","true","0.5"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

It's someone else's re-imaganing of the original XCOM games. The game is real time, but it can be paused whenever you want. There is a global map screen where you select missions, though they appear at random. UFO interception is purely RNG. You can have a dogfight end with all of your jets intact when they have no upgrades, and the same UFO can wipe out your squadron with full upgrades.\n\nIn battles, your squad is limited to a maximum of 7. Soldiers gain generic XP for kills/KOs, and you can then choose which attribute to level up at the end of the mission if they get enough XP.\n\nThere is no economy to speak of. Good for those just wanting to get into this type of game, but maybe a turn off to those who want micro-management. This game is certainly more macro-management on the globe screen, with micro-management for your soldiers (don't forget to pack extra ammo!).\n\nThe aliens late game can be brutal. I get the feeling I'm doing something wrong or using the wrong weapons, but they can drop my soldiers in 2 hits even with the best armour. I'm using some of the strongest rifles in the game and it takes 10 hits to put them down.\n\nI'd give it a 6/10. Not a masterpiece, but enjoyable enough. I should also note, that this game does not fully support the Steam overlay. You can still access it, but key presses are still registered in game. So typing in chat leads to a load of key presses in game.","July 28, 2015","true","27.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

There is no economy so your choices are mostly about what you need the most and a good positioning of your military bases.\n\nThe tactical layer offer various missions for your squads. A big plus for this game is that you do not need to kill all the enemies, some missions can be finished in two minutes if you know what you are doing. Plus, if you can skip missions by delegating them.\n\nYou can equip your soldiers in various ways with grenades, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, shotguns and even slow but powerful collapsible railguns. All these weapons are good for their roles and you'll need to properly use them to win.\n\nThe only big downside of this game is the weird difficuly curve. First it is really easy, but at a certain step of the story, the enemy gets suddenly really powerful. This gives the false feeling that the game is first too easy then impossible. Truth is that you only need to use all the tools you collected in the later half and, with a proper strategy, you can still win.\n\nSo it's a good game that you should play if you are a fan of tactical games.","April 14","true","17.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is also cool management system, which I actualy like more than missions itself, and also research and develpoment is pretty rich :) If you like turn-based isometric view tactical combined with interesting earth managment in sci-fi aliens theme or old XCOM games, I recommend.","January 30, 2015","true","12.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

Now, of course, we have a new "true" X-com game, but this little gem is still worth playing I think. It's not really turn-based like the older games (rather it uses a hybrid system with pausing) and it lacks some stuff in the micromanaging departement (like the ability to have and equip multiple ships to take care of multiple missions, etc) but it's still a bunch of fun.\n\nLike others have mentioned, it runs at a 4:3 resolution (1024x768) which means it stretches on most modern monitors. I was able to make my monitor not stretch it using the monitor's own menus. Great success! Now I can play fullscreen without stretching!\n\nAnother little trick: Not sure if it's been documented, but I find scrolling in battle using Alt+Shift+mouse movement much easier and quicker than using the arrow keys. I just hate that "camera inertia" of the arrow keys and the slowness of using the screen borders. So Alt+Shift works for me.","April 27, 2014","true","26.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Consider it a "skip this mission" button. The game would be enjoyable, but then things suddenly go horribly, horribly wrong...\n\nThat little while ends when the game starts throwing aliens with mega green armor at you. On top of that, the aliens get rocket launchers, yellow death beams which drop you faster than you can say "Well, time to reload a save," psi guns that incapacitate or possess your troops even if they have heroic willpower and psi-helmets, and these blue alien grenade launchers which do rapid-fire, mega-splash damage and can wipe out your entire squad in four shots.\n\nAll the enemies in this game are somewhat creative but almost all are colored the same, dull, dusty gray. There's an enemy in  the game that looks like a giant larva which zaps your troops with a physically harmless purple beam which has a good chance of stunning them for an incredibly long time. Just one of these creatures can stunlock your entire squad permanently because they're also rapid fire, then you have to reload a save.\n\nI tried save-scumming my way through this game on easy mode, and I couldn't do it. I tried waiting in a corner and luring the enemies to get killed when they round the corner, and it still was insanely difficult. I had elite troops with high stats in all fields, with the best equipment I could get, and I still wound up reloading saves constantly, and still not being able to beat the campeign. The difficulty curve of this game is so strong, sudden, steep, and unforgivingly hard that it breaks the game into a near-unplayable state. My guess is that the developers decided to make the game more challenging not by adding new situations and tactics but by just making all the enemies stronger.\n\nIn a nutshell, this game is just so ridiculously hard that it's not worth buying.","May 26, 2014","false","22.9"," 25 of 62 people (40%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","40","25","62","4","4"
