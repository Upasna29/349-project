Been playing with the Matrix Store version of the game prior to its steam release. I believe the game has been around for quite awhile now but it is only known to a few number of people. I was browsing the Matrix store a few years ago after hearing about Distant Worlds and I stumbled upon this gem.\n\nThe game is a wargame with a lot of mechanics like entrenchement, morale, supplies, etc. The game may not be the prettiest but it is appropriate for a game of its kind. The game looks like a hex-based boardgame with the unit counters on the tiles. The default units look like the actual units but for those who want something realistic then I would suggest getting the NATO counters mod for the game.\n\nAdvanced Tactics gold is made by the same person who made the Decisive Campaigns series for the PC. Advanced Tactics is a traditional wargame that sits in the sweet spot between beer and pretzel Panzer Generals to the complex mind-boggling simulation that is War in the East/Pacific. The game is easy to learn but hard to master. The game could be played like many traditional wargames where there are scenarios (I think it includes a WW2 scenario and some scenarios could be downloaded from the ATG site). The best feature of the game is the random map generator where you can tweak some options like expensive research or starting with only the most basic military tech and researching improved units. The randomly generated map could be tweaked from presets if you want more oceans (if you want more naval combat/invasions) or more land (simulate the eastern front)  and a whole lot more. Playing random map generator sorts of lets you play the game as something like most 4x games where you have to uncover the maps and capture resource sites and build some fortifications, ports, factories, etc. The cities serve as important hexes that gives victory points. Capturing victory points would let you win the game.\n\nThe best part of this game is that you can't win by brute force. You have to put a lot of things in to consideration. So lets say you got the tech for the biggest tanks but these tanks uses a lot of fuel. A low fuel reserve might turn your tanks in to useless piece of scrap metal. So you are not protecting your supply lines? A well-placed paratrooper unit behind your lines would cut your supplies and weaken your forces. You got 100 rifle units and the enemy has only 50 SMG units well entrenched in a city? They will cut you to shreds! Oh you are laughing at that unit with only 15 rifles and 3 machineguns and you think your 50 rifle units could roflstomp them? Well I don't think so! Your oil reserves are dwindling and you want to move your artilleries around fast? Then you better get the horses to drag them!\n\nIts things like this that make this game close to infinitely replayable as every game can turn out differently and you can choose whether to use air superiority, drop tons of troops more that what was paradropped during market garden or do an amphibious invasion that would put overlord to shame, then you have the option in this game! I paid around $50 for a digital copy of this game and I must say that I have no regrets! It is really worth it. It makes you think and does not ensure that you would just start to steamroll over your opponents once you get your advanced units. I will be bold to say that IMHO this is the best wargame ever!","August 18, 2014","true","4.2"," 80 of 92 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","80","92","0","0"

The way the AI plays you'd assume it was cheating, but it isn't. Instead, the AI is exploiting you as much as it can; taking advantage of obvious mistakes. Unlike many other games in the genre, the AI is *actually* trying to outsmart you, outflank you, out-produce you, and generally stomp all over you (within reason, depending on the difficulty settings).\n\nAlso... As others have pointed out, the user interface *is clunky*, but honestly it is a lot of fun regardless once you get the hang of the keyboard shortcut schema.","July 20, 2015","true","234.1"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","21","29","2","0"

That plus many parameters for random generator and many premade scenarios can get you an unlimited replayability and incredible variety: want to play WWII scenario? You can! Want to have almost 4x stile game with exploration and research (minus diplomacy)? You can! Want a huge war with thousands of units or a small cousy war? It is up to you to choose. AI is challenging enough, and that is not granted in contemporary strategy games. And there even is a RPG element where your officers gain levels and feats.

Very good game, I was watching a Youtube gameplay and really liked how the game was presented and functioned.\n\nedit: Lot of downvote because previously a very short review. AT:G is like Sid Meier's Civilization V for wargamers. Endless replayability, a random generator and a level editor where you can create your own scenarios. The multiplayer is file format, all you do is tick password protection on, and the rest is self explanatory. You end your turn, save the file and send it via dropbox or google drive (shared folder).\nAs for the gameplay, AT:G is realistic in a sense that there is oil, political points, and raw material stockpiles to consider when building your army. Not to mention the fact you can craft every unit into divisions and HQs, which in a way can simulate a corps and army. Some people complain about the UI, but if it were designed any other way managing every division would be difficult, the UI allows you to maximize the control over the customization and movement of each and every division. You even have to use the UI to move your units, you don't click on a division and right click to move, you click on the division, clik the move button on the UI and then prompt where you want the unit to move. It may be meticulous at first, but the game is a lot deeper than speed play, in my opinion, you are getting the full wargame and World War II experience. What I mean is, if you are looking for a game based on World War II, maybe you've been playing some first person shooters and was thinking to yourself you'll love a strategy game where you can have a capital, make a lot of units and have a war against not just one, but multiple nations and fronts, then AT:G will give you just that. I say this because I was playing Call of Duty World At War, and while I was playing it, AT:G was just repeatedly coming to my mind, in fact playing CoDWaR maybe intensified my feelings for this game because while CodWar is giving you the first person shooter experience, AT:G gives you the strategy/4X/Grand Strategy experience.","February 25","true","42.6"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

It's without a doubt a thinking man's (or woman's) game.  You can play everything from a basic infantry to capital ships.  Tons of scenerios (free to download) to play but the real gem is playing a random generated map.  One of the great aspects of the game is the concrete engine and how it handles supply.  To fight you need supply and bleed to death if you're forces are cut off.  Create your own divisions, rename them (if you want) and assign them to a HQ.  Heck you can even create your Div model and use that to create and supply new units.  To get a handle on this game and see how it plays check out YouTube as there are some great YouTubers that cover this game and it's mechanics in detail.\n\nThe AI is actually pretty good in this game too.  It will use & exploit openings to turn your smile to a frown.  You can chose how bad or brutal the AI is in each game.\n\nAgain the life of your forces are supply.  Unlike other games that simulate supply, this game will actually show how supply is reaching (or not) your troops to you can plan rather you need to hold the cross roads or build another one.  If you cut off and surround a powerful unit you can just sit back and let them bleed dry.  Unless they can mount air supply drops to that unit it will starve and become unless.  But then again if they use their cargo planes to resupply they'll have to fight through your air intercepters.  Use engineers to build roads or bridges across streams and rivers for better movement and supply.  Chose exactly use each of your cities produce and supply your HQs to wage war or to pepper up defense.  All your choice!\n\nReally the only downside to this game is it's clunky UI (feels like it's from the 90's) which could use a huge overhaul.  If they did that I'd probably buy it again just on that alone.  This game does have a bit of a learning curve but like I said watch some YouTubers on this game and the rest is up to you.\n\nBattle on!","April 17","true","57.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not just a rehash of WW2 over and over, the base game actually gives way to a random, balanced environment each time, with map generation settings for your flavor. And this is good! The game itself is actively developed and extremely moddable, pretty much being a sandbox of possible relatively easily accessible, hex-based nitty gritty strategey. And that's good! Some reviews will probably mention a lot of nit picking details, like having to hand make your units - those are old reviews, with development allowing for "templates" of units you can set, which those units automatically requesting reinforcements to meet those templates instead of YOU doing it. Unit interaction makes sense, almost all details you can understand and go "Yeah, alright, I get this."\n\nNow the bad. For one, the AI is kind of a miserable experience, this is very much a multiplayer game. You're gonna want friends to play with or a community to join. It's also probably going to be play be email, which is a pretty slow going time. The documentation of the game is pretty bad, with unit descriptions being typo riddled, for one, and tutorials and other manual-likes being pretty shoddy. True, once you understand how to do something it's very easy to do it and to get the information needed quickly, but to actually get to that point you're probably going to need out of game help. And honestly? At a price tag of thirty bucks that might be a bit high.\n\nStill, if you have people you can play it with and are interested in the whole niche genre, it makes for an outstanding entry point.","April 1","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat is well thought-out, well defended/entrenched hexes cannot be broken by simply spamming units and raiding them over and again, and (with default rules) you cannot build one massive invincible unit; rather you have to have the right combined arms, the right placement and the right strategy.\n\nI learned the game quite quickly, from 'dastactic' on youtube and the 20 page strategy guide.\nI like it a lot.","April 28","true","30.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A hands-on, nitty gritty no hand holding strategy game. To be able to play it successfully I would recommend to read the PDF-manual (140 pages) at least once or, even better, several times. To learn by playing is probably doable but very, very frustrating. It took me roughly five minutes to figure out how to order an attack, since I didn't take the time to read the manual. The learning curve for the game is pretty much straight up.\n\nThe game puts you in charge of everything. What to produce (supply, research or troops), where to produce it, how to distribute it, command over troops, creation of armies, where to attack, with whom and how. The list of what you have to manage is long and it's really easy to get lost by all the details you have to manage. Having its roots in the strategy boardgaming tradition I can see how a single turn easily can be upwards of 30 minutes in the larger scenarios.\n\nIt's not pretty. Being a computer strategy board game it eschews fancy graphics, instead showing the typical square markers for your troops on a functional but quite drab map.\n\nThese kind of games are really hard to rate. For a casual gamer, I can't recommend it but for a hardcore strategy fan it's really good (especially since this sub-group usually don't care about graphics at all).\n\nSo, no score this time, but it's really not for everyone....","May 22","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
