It's simple and you can get right into it. It has great design and good immersion with nice music and pixely visual effects. It is really cheap and since refunding is really easy, you should really try it out.  Now, there are some improvements to be made.  The biggest problems are: • the keys/commands are not rebindable • there is only one song and it does get repetitive • the game really wants you to tweet and to use a controller (you'll undertand when you buy the game) • coins become useless after you've unlocked all the spaceships  Other complaints: • it starts off really easy/relaxing and then out of nowhere it becomes so incredibly difficult very fast,       usually what makes it so difficult is the fast and repetitive spawning of the rockets that shoot out   projectiles in your direction • there is no difficulty selection • there should be other gamemodes, most of the time the game is challenging and sometimes can be frustrating so I think there should be some kind of 'relax' mode where it gets harder slower / stays at the same difficulty just to enjoy the game • the controls are a bit clunky and it feels like aiming is limited because of the movement • even though the game kind of encourages the use of a controller, using a keyboard results in better movement and aim","January 31","true","4.6"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

This is pure arcade-style gameplay. The only 'permanent' upgrades are unlockable ships that you gain from earning in-game currency. The only real goal is getting a high score.  Essentially, the whole game plays on a single scren. If you hit the edge of the screen, you die. The primary mechanic or novelty is the shooting mechanic. While it is toggle-able, you are constantly shooting which obviously depletes ammo stores - which you replenish by pickups dropped when enemies are killed. There are various temporary gun upgrades sort of reminiscent of Contra (not sure why that game comes to mind, but it does).  Look, are you going to dump hours and hours into this? Probably not. But for about a buck, you get a pretty wicked game to pass the controller around with friends and try to beat each other's score.","May 21","true","0.4"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

Mostly comparable to Asteroids.The only problem is that you permanently moving and shooting, like an abandonded zombie ship. You are just able to dogde enemy bullets with an extra boost. If you collect the yellow coins during gameplay you can later afford better spaceships. The best is ship V7 and has 3 lives(shields), speed=3 and acurrancy=3. Your ammo also depletes automatically. So keep on collecting ammopacks and be aware of powerups that shoot more than 1 bullet/sec.","February 9","true","5.8"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","20","25","2","0"

It brings back memories of me going to those arcades and playing the game that you would spend token after token on, but this is even better because once you buy it you dont need to pay again, you can just keep on play for hours on end. Also I LOVE the cool power ups for your ship and how there sre so many of them  my personal favourite is the one that makes a beam come out of your ship. I also love how there many different ships that provide different styles of play!

Or something like that... Yeah. I think I got it right. Or close enough, at least. You get to choose your ship at the beginning of the game, you pick up some power-ups and blow up moving stuff. Your ship got 2 "Lives", the shield and the hull, so watch out for enemies and projectiles and also, you should also watch your ammo, as your ship will be shooting non-stop and think wisely about which power-ups to pick, because even though they are pretty OP and will help you a lot to clear the space around you, they'll eat your ammo like candy and leave you with your pants on the ground with severe case of diahrrea, surrounded by enemies. So yeah... Conserve your ammo, guys. Also, couple of other points I'd like to mention about this game...  It's cheap. Cheaper than a handy from a hobo on a parking lot. 1 dollah' is more than fair for this casual fun game. Also, if you are feeling extra-cheep, there are some trading cards you could sell. If you are into рissiпg contests, this game have a global score counter, where you could compete with random strangers from all around the world and prove to everyone once and for all who is the strongest warrior of keyboard... Or gamepad, for that matter. Mostly, gamepad. This game is more enjoyable with one of those... If you have one. If you haven't, it's no biggie, you can play it with keyboard. Now that I think about it, this should've been point 4... Gamepad. But I am no Gaben and I like number 3. So, yeah... Anyway. It's a good casual game and I do recommend it to everyone who is into classics and pseudo-retro pixel-like games. Or casual games... Or just games. Or into really cheap games... Yeah. Anyway, good game and I give it a solid...  8/10.","January 22","true","5.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

I played this game with a Xbox 360 controller.  First thoughts: "Hmmm, don't really care for the constant shooting, but i guess that is the theme of the 80's and i can't complain. The controls feel a little wonky too (the ship moves the same amount with the joystick barely pushed in one direction and fully pushed in one direction). But hey, it was $0.89 so i can't complain too much."  After playing for 10 minutes: "Well, the leader boards seem fun and the scores aren't completely out of reach. Maybe just one or two more rounds."  Then, i found myself just wanting to play another round and try and get a higher spot on the leader boards. I really just couldn't put the game down.  Final opinion: I think the game could use some adjustments to the controls. But it is extremely addicting and very fun to play when just relaxing or you just want to waste 5 minutes.  For the price of $0.89, i give the game an 8.5/10","January 22","true","3.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

The premise of the game is that you're a spaceship, trying to collect ammo and surviving as long as you can. The ship fires and moves automatically, so all you have to worry about is steering and boosting. Evidently, I haven't gotten very far in it yet, but from first impressions, the game is a lot of fun. The simple controls make for a fun, frantic, bit-sized adventure that keeps you saying "just one more game." In the way of complaints, my only one is that it definitely feels like a mobile game, in that the controls seem suited more for a touch screen than a controller, and the monetary system seems directly ripped from Sonic Dash and the like. Still, if you can get past that, or even better, get this game on Android or IOS, than it's an absolute blast.","January 23","true","0.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

If you are looking for a getaway game this is probably your game and with $1 price tag its a steal!  Well things that i don't really like (based on the time that i write this review) are  - There's no pause menu. (It'll be added soon-ish though) - The screen will be a giant cluster♥♥♥♥ of mess when you reach 8k or more score. By then good luck on spotting your own ship on the screen full of explosion and things - The Bounce Gun(?) rate of fire is ridiculously high, just about 10-20secs after you get the power-up you'll ran out of ammo instantly.  Well i think that's my short review of this game, but since it's only a day from release i'll be looking on this game again soon after it's matured a little bit. :D","January 23","true","0.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

You grew up with video arcades.  2. You like sh'mups.  3. You like unlocking stuff.  I'd already bought this game from the moment I saw the gameplay style and graphics in the trailer way before I even placed it into my Cart.  You can select to fire manually or have the ship shoot automatically, forever. "(+)" coins are your ammo and, depending on which ship you're currently flying and which mode you're in, you'll want to grab every last one of these suckers. Don't worry about them too much though as they will all gravitate inwards towards you.  Also be on the lookout for gold coins, you'll want to collect these to unlock additional ships. Collect more coins by taking out special golden enemies. Each ship has different Speed, Attack, and Shield stats to make things more interesting. Be a speedy glass cannon or a slow but powerful bruiser. In Automatic Mode, a ship's attack level is directly tied to how fast it will eat through ammo stores.  Power-ups, power-ups, power-ups! Homing missles, area bombs, spread guns, laser beams, bouncing plasma balls, and rapid-fire cannons just to name a few. New weapon types have been added every patch or so and you can probably expect even more in the future.  Pros:  -Great Dev, very active with player feedback -Updates have been solid -Bright graphics -Assorted power-ups -Unlock Ships -Good with 360 Pad  Cons:  -I keep dying and immediately playing again -Going for all the achievements will probably turn me into a basket case  The down-sides are only temporary, the fun will last.","January 23","true","4.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The ship they control is constantly moving forward, to dodge enemies and thier bullets the player must turn with the right and left arrow keys as well as can use a boost, or could take the hit with a shield. As players progress in the game they recieve ammo, which allows them to keep firing at enemies to get more and more ammo and the game is infinite. Instead of an ammo drops, RNG gods can grant the player a shiny golden coin! These coins can be used to buy a different ship, some ships are bigger with more shields, smaller with more speed, and is up to the player on how they wish to play the game. Along with that choice, the developer gives more choices to players, as you can actually toggle auto-firing OFF! Which leads to more strategic gameplay that lessens the arcade feel the game has.  Pros:+Unique weapons +Easy to learn +Unlockable ships +Manual Fire mode +Soundtrack +Full controller support +Steam trading cards, achievements, AND leaderboards  Cons:-Repetitive gameplay -End game isnt as enjoyable  Judgement: 8/10 Its simple, its fun, its cheap. I highly recommend to all players that enjoy arcade games, and even if you dont its cheap, enjoyable, and a great game to have in your steam library, get it :)  For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","April 7","true","7.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

It looks like a retro Asteroids-style shooter [and it is] but while remaining simple in concept it is much more sophisticated than it appears.  The game is addictive, in a very good way, it keeps you coming back and wanting to be better at playing it. The movement is fluid and the graphics look cool but what stands out to me is the sound design: the music is very good and makes you strive to survive and keep going, the sound effects are perfect, giving you that rewarding feeling when you grab a coin or blow up  stuff. There is enough variety in the ships you unlock to make playing with each a slightly different experience. Game keeps challenging your mind and focus, as you have to watch out for collisions and be careful not to run out of ammo while aiming and controlling the speed. Another plus is the developer seems to be accessible and listening to  feedback.  Overall a nice indie title worth more than its price! You might have more fun with this than some overpriced AAA titles.","January 31","true","7.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

This game proves that graphics mean nothing when it comes to raw fun!  Super simple controls.. whatever device you use, controller, keyboard, or mouse!  I prefer the keyboard myself, A & D to turn left and right, and the Space bar to use your speed up/turbo!  Easy to learn, but difficult to truly master, and with the hypnotic music in the background, this game makes you want to play over and over and over and over!!  This game is so cool, that I've even decided to give away $170 in Steam contest money for people who can post video of the highest scores achieved playing THIS game!  Take a peek at that video right here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nej5GA1NP8  For under $1 ??

Handles like Luftrausers - you only steer your craft left or right, it is always moving forward and always firing.  Enemies drop ammo pickups to replenish your limited ammo (though you always have your basic gun, running out simply takes away your active weapon powerup) and coins which can be spent on new craft.  Plays like a mix of Luftrausers and Asteroids with the former's array of different handling craft but a simple, enjoyable gameplay loop where a run can be over in seconds due to a silly mistake, but restarting is very fast for another try.  Controls are tight and every death feels like YOUR fault, not the game's.

It is similar to several differnent classic arcade games that I have played, and I am a sucker for retro games. I have been really enjoying the game, and have even been catching myself trying again and again just trying to better my high score and place higher on the leaderboards.   Controls are simple. Your little ship moves automatically, with you being able to control its turning, as well as having control over a boost that depletes and recharges over time. Your ship fires automatically as well, and there are many different power-ups that spawn on the screen that you can pick up that will change your weapon. You weapon uses ammo which can be reloaded by shooting enemies and picking up their little green balls. All is simple, even death. There are no lives and if you get shot without your sheilds, you're done for!   The game also has a little currency system where enemies may occasionally drop gold coins, which you can use to purchase new ships!   In my opinion, This game is super well made, and as of the 1.1 version, all of the bugs below have been FIXED from what I have been able to witness. The developer gets an A+ for responding to reviews and fixing these bugs in a timely manner. Kudos to you Dev. :)  + (FIXED) While using a controller, a "ghost" of myself would spawn with me and remain motionless while i fly around. If the ghost took damage, it would end the game for me. + (FIXED) The "H" power-up (Homing projectile) could be picked up but not fire a single homing shot. Only the basic weapon would remain active. + (FIXED) Enemy's red projectiles would sometimes do much more damage then they should, taking down multiple layers of your sheild instead of just one layer. I could be wrong in which some projectiles are meant to deal more damage, but I haven't seen any consistencies in damage output by certain enemies. (Bug perhaps? Would be nice to get some feedback from the devs on this.)   Main thing I would like to see in a future update would be more products in the shop. There is a total of only seven ships in the game, and when you buy them, there is nothing left to buy and gold then becomes obsolete, unless you want to collect lots of gold, like me! I would love to see additions to the shop to spend my gold on. (i.e. More ships, power-ups to unlock, ship appearences, rocket trails, enemy appearences, etc.)   This game has huge potential to become something even better than it already is. The Developer is super positive and proactive on fixing bugs, and I cannot wait to see what else could be in store for the future. I definitely would recommend this game to anyone who loves simple, casual, challenging indie games. This game is certainly worth the 99 cents!","January 26","true","4.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Bit Blaster XL is a space themed shoot-em-up, a concept almost as old as video games themselves so you know exactly what you're buying and thus I don't need to explain any further. Despite the fact that it is a theme that has been done to death, this is surprisingly a lot of fun to play and has proven to be incredibly addictive.  Your ammunition rapidly depletes as a result of your ship constantly auto-firing forcing you to collect the ammo power-ups throughout all of the hazards on screen, which becomes very challenging after a certain point in time. Collectables include coins to unlock other ships in your arsenal and different temporary weapons, ranging from rapid fire, bouncing projectiles, explosives and even a light saber esque weapon, plus many more.  As your points increase, so does the difficulty, things become very hectic after the 10,000 point margin always keeping you on your toes. One word of advice though, if you're going to play this, I would highly recommend using a controller, it's tough to maneuver using a keypad.  I couldn't recommend this game highly enough, especially since it's incredibly cheap. There is much, much worse you could be using your £0.79 for. The awesome soundtrack alone is worth more than that.","January 25","true","24.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Gameplay couldn't be more simpler and difficulty curve keeps slowly going up. Highscore is what you are aiming for. Everything else is just fluff.  And when you die it's all your own fault so keep on practicing.  Controls work nicely. nothing to complain (played on gamepad).  Music is ok. though the one simple tune will soon need to muted. Generally the music could have been more...hmm... meatier? But i suppose thats just the old man being nostalgic.

It is quite fun for $1 game. Worth it :D  I got a problem starting the game after installing. The game stopped working at loading screen. I fixed it by verify the game cache. right click the game > properties > local files > verifiy integrity of game cache.  The game has simple control. Right & left to turn, Space to boost, and Ctrl to fire. And it offers auto fire which you don't have to press Ctrl anymore. There are 8 different ships, and many power up, makes the game more fun. Game size is small. It has trading cards and achievements. The achievement is quite tough, I can't even unlock 15k achievement. If you like challenging action shooter game, try this game.  EDIT: Too bad the game doesn't have Steam Cloud synchronization.

Bit Blaster is an excellent example of this philosophy: Basic 8 bit graphics and a simple play style (think Asteroids without brakes) make this game a simple joy to play. I usually don't like games where firing is automatic but Bit Blaster incorperates this in to the core of the game mechanic so instead of being a shortcut (this started life as a touch screen game) it is actually part of what makes it great. Unlockable ships, varied weapon power-ups and old school appeal combine to make Bit Blaster a great game to play when you just want to skip the back story and blow crap up.

Bit Blaster XL is a mix of Asteroids, Robotron and Berzerk. Camera is over the space room full of enemies. You have a spaceship with limited ammo. The trick is: better weapons needs more ammo. Even without combo point system you had to destroy someting constantly, because every dead enemy drops ammo and you need it to feed a weapon. If you're out of ammo, you're back to a standard pew pew laser.  It's a very simple, but effective mechanic. It's always risk vs reward, so you can play safe, or beat a crap out of hi-score. Game is really hard, because most weapons shoots only in the direction that you are flying (like in Berzerk), but enemies of course are all over you and can aim. So it is a challenge, like any other arcade style shooter, but not unfair and I feel I can handle it.  Have fun.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  EDIT: Last upgrade is really nice. More powerups (including new shelds), ability to speed up, enemies respawns more often. I feel I'm dying much faster, but scoring faster, too.","February 4","true","2.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You have a ship, and you have two speeds: Going and Going Faster. The challenge comes when you have to shoot enemies to get more ammo/points, and collect powerups. The powerups have huge variety, from shooting multiple bullets in a sort of wall to exploding bullets. There are multiple ships you can upgrade to by collecting coins which are dropped by various enemies. There are also various types of enemies in the game, and to up the challenge you can disable autofiring and fire yourself. Both keyboard and controller are supported, and my Steam controller worked right away without even having to open Big Picture mode [ymmv].  The game (as of version 2.02) is somewhat sparse in the settings menu, but it gets the job done.  I have tested it on Linux, and it runs very well.

That includes me. While the pixel art reminds me of other SEM, the gameplay doesn´t, and it sucks that I have to say that. Turning the ship itself can be slow and clunky, but that wouldn´t really be a problem if there wasn´t an ammo limit. I feel that the ammo breaks the game. It makes it even slower. I feel like a faster mode without ammo limits should be added. That would make this an intense, hard but rewarding game. There are more ships you can unlock with coins you get by playing, and there are power-ups when in game, wich makes this a little bit more of an anjoyable experience. Also, the music can get really repetitive and annoying. More music options would be great. Other than that, if you want to kill some time, go for it.

There is also no way to conserve your ammunition as you are always firing automatically. Shooting things causes them to explode into ammunition pickups; while a variety of different powerups pass across the screen, some more powerful than others, some using ammunition faster than others.

It's exactly like all the nostalgia ridden games that arcades are known for, but it's cheap and won't have to having to ask your mom for more quarters.  Seriously, it's a really addictive and fun game. I find myself repeatedly playing, "just one more round," even though I said that 10 minutes ago. It's a great game to play for a while, with a fair challenge, and plenty of interesting rewards.

That includes me. While the pixel art reminds me of other SEM, the gameplay doesn´t, and it sucks that I have to say that. Turning the ship itself can be slow and clunky, but that wouldn´t really be a problem if there wasn´t an ammo limit. I feel that the ammo breaks the game. It makes it even slower. I feel like a faster mode without ammo limits should be added. That would make this an intense, hard but rewarding game. There are more ships you can unlock with coins you get by playing, and there are power-ups when in game, wich makes this a little bit more of an anjoyable experience. Also, the music can get really repetitive and annoying. More music options would be great. Other than that, if you want to kill some time, go for it. It´s low price and the dev. appreciates every kind of feedback he can get. 7/10","April 1","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ness1228/recommended/433950/","Ness1228","Ness1228","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ness1228/","83 products in account","This game is short and sweet. If you're using a keyboard, the controls are limited to 3 buttons: you steer your ship with the left and right arrow keys, and use your boost with the spacebar. There's an auto-fire option where the ship continuously shoots, or there's a manual-fire option where you can press ctrl or alt to fire a shot. If you don't want to use a keyboard to play, you can also use a gamepad.  The gameplay is simple; You shoot the enemies to score points, and each enemy drops a green ammo pickup that slowly moves towards you. It may seem easy, but scoring really high becomes difficult since you can't stop your ship, and some enemies shoot (slow moving) bullets towards you.  My one and only complaint is that there is no pause button, but on an arcade-styled game like this that's meant to be short and replayed, the lack of a pause function is practically a non-issue unless you're going for a marathon score run.  For what Bit Blaster XL has to offer, I'd say it is definitely worth the price and I strongly recommend it as a great casual game. One last thing I'd like to mention is that the developers for this game actively reply to any potential issues and questions, which I think is a huge plus.","April 5","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You are one of the last lines of defense that your planet has. You step in the rocket and see the platform slowly move further away from you. And then you see them. The asteroids. You start firing at them, destroying them and defending earth as much as you can. You see your first support from earth in a glowing, colorful ball. You fly your ship towards it, to find out it is an upgrade for your gun. You install it and find out its power. After a while, earth asks you to start collecting coin-like alien material that, once back down on earth, can be used to upgrade your ship. Sometime later, you send a packet of about 5 coins down to earth, and in return you get another ship. Smaller, faster, it has faster firing capabilites and is better in many ways. You defend earth with all your might, recieving support in the form of new spaceships and gun upgrades when you see the aliens ships firing towards you. You start firing towards them too, trying to dodge the asteroids as much as you can. As you slowly become more focused on the situation, you start to find out how to fly effectively and how to dodge asteroids to only focus on the spaceships. You realize your entire team has been taken out by the aliens.  You are earth's last hope. You are the Bit Blaster.  (That was a story I wrote for the plot of the game: don't presume it is official, that is just what I like to imagine it being :])  Overall, this is a very good game for its value. It has great music, is a decent difficulty and has a lot of features that take a little bit of time to learn. Overall, it is simple but has great mechanics and is a rewarding experience when you finally reach the drop. I highly recommend this game to a lot of people, especially those who like the game Asteroids (the arcade game, you know)","January 29","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's worth the 79p if you have it, and definitely worth the 39p it is on sale for (as of writing this review)","April 4","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think this is a good game with little flaws and margin to improve. The only two things i can sa about this game are: 1. If you must unlock the ships in order, instead of for example buying the last for 60 coins and skiping all the previous ones, there is no point to have to buy them manually. The game needs more variety of weapons. A bigger map would not be bad. And the player should be able to change the color of the ship, because it is sometimes hard to find where you are. A co-op mode would be nice too, because this is the type of game that everyone can play for short periods and with friends. A local PvP would be great too.

Where do I even start?  Bit Blaster XL is a modern take on some of the old retro-sytle arcade games you played back in the 80s(yes i'm not from the 80s. mind you. I was born 2001) there is 8 ships, and each has its' own custom speed,fire rate, shield durability, and song! with each ship it is a little different than the last considering you only have a max of 100 ammo, but there is an option for manual shooting if you want more of a challenge.  Not to mention since each ship is different you have to adapt to all of them. they each have a different play style. it's kinda like you just got a new game and need to learn how it works. The game has great graphics, and even if you have a $200 laptop that's OK! this game barely needs much at all. there is around a dozen or more powerups and each is different. once you run out of ammo with a powerup then you have to collect more ammo, but you lose the powerup, but don't worry. you can pick up ammo with the powerup: just be careful! don't run into the walls! there is a bit of variety when it comes to enemies. the higher your score: the stronger then enemies(and the more too! might I add).  You unlock ships by using coins which randomly drop from enemies and some enemies only drop coins. What to talk about next? Ah Yes! The songs are also great! they have a real 8-Bit feel to them(Props and kudos to Spiff Tune. he did an amazing job on the songs. if you're reading this; good job man!). there is such a variety with this game and no two games will be the same! all the things fit really well together and it really feels like an 80s game!

I haven't picked up an arcade pixel game in a long long time, and for this price, why not? I very much enjoy the music and how it changes with each ship (so that way your ears don't get burned out when trying to beat your last high score). I also like how it's not impossible to get coins to unlock new ships. One thing I do dislike is your ammo is rapidly depleting (with the first two ships at least) and it's a bit hard to try to destroy everything, not die, and keep gathing ammo when your ammo is going down faster than America's pride.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nuts1236/recommended/433950/","Nuts1236","Nuts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nuts1236/","144 products in account","Bit Blaster XL is an arcade game in the style of Asteroids and Geometry Wars.  This game can get pretty brutal at points, especially at the beginning when you don’t have very good ships. You collect coins and can buy new ships that move faster, have more shields, or fire faster. They vary enough that you can find the one you are most comfortable using. However, most of the time you will just end up using Ship 7 or 8 as they have the most shield, fire the quickest, and move the fastest.  There are also weapon pickups that change the way you fire. Some cause explosions, some give you a shotgun style blast, some make you fire incredibly fast. The amount of pickups does become a bit redundant as there are two pickups that are really overpowered and make the others pointless.  You will end up only using about 3 different pickups.  One of the biggest problems with this game is the controls. Using a controller still made it hard to be accurate at points and the keyboard was even worse. The ships move way to quick at points and make it hard to be precise. I’m not sure if it was just me but this ended up infuriating me at points. Another problem is how slow the score rises. If you go for every achievement, getting to 75k can take a while. You just don’t get enough points. This is quite disheartening when you think you are doing really well and you have destroyed a load of enemies to find out that you only have 15k points.  I honestly didn’t really enjoy my time playing this game for the reasons that i gave above, however i know that some people will enjoy this game.  It is quite fun if you played it to kill 10 minutes every now and then, but as someone who played this for a 5 hour sitting one time, it might start to bug the hell out of you, If you think this looks fun, go for it. Its pretty cheap and you will get your moneys worth in the end. 5/10.","May 10","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While many of my old criticisms still stand, the recent update done by the developer Nickervision added enough new content that I found it more worthwhile to play (now on my newly unlocked fourth ship which I quickly came to prefer over the previous three).  Much of the combat is as I described before, but I'd like to reiterate how the powerups are the best part of this game. They often change the way the game is played in ways both large and small. with some, the best strategy is to be calm and fire conservatively like with the blue explosive power up, while with others, the best strategy is to spray and pray, like with the richocheting pink power up. I quickly found ones that I prefered. My favorite was always the purple one that acted like a short range shot gun.  Of course, minor critisisms became more pronounced the longer I played. It's often very easy to take multiple hits in quick succession for ships with shields due to the lack of invinsibility frames. The scoreboard is pretty meaningless and hard to get to considering this is a game where the only goal is to get a high score.  In fact, after a while, the game gets pretty samey. Since the score is such an after thought, the only reason to play the game is for the game's own sake. Once every round of bit blasting feels like the last one, it starts to get boring. After the first few ship unlocks, it takes too long to get the next ship for that to be a proper motivation to keep playing.  Still, for all it's faults, I had a decent ammount of fun with it. For the price of a dollar, I think it's worth a try, especially if it's on sale.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Ship combat is not Bit Blaster's strength. Bullets only eject from the front of the ship, and the ship can only go forward with an incredibly large turning radius. It's clunky. That's not to say that you can't get good at it, it's just not fun to get good at.  What is Bit Blaster XL's strength then? well, it has some kick ♥♥♥ music. That alone kept me going for longer than I would normally have.  I think the real strength of Bit Blaster is its power up system. Each power up is completely unique and has the potential to be completely game changing. Sure, there are the mundane ones that just make you fire faster or also shoot from your butt, but there are also the ones that make large balls the same size as your ship bounce off the walls of the screen, filling the entire thing with your bullets, or the ones that make explosives that blow up everything in front of your ship, or the one that gives you a short range laser that makes you have to get up in the business of anythin you want to kill.  They're pretty sweet, I'll admit.  Still, it's not enough to carry the game for me. The terrible controls really hinder the game, and the space ships that I unlocked before quitting were pretty lack luster. Maybe someone else will find it more fun than I did.","February 4","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","5"

Feels a little thin, like it's one mechanic (combo meter? power-up stacking? hidden bonuses? secret levels? non-gold-based unlocks?) short of being five-star work. But I can't really demand a 99-cent game to have those kind of frills.  It's simple, decently replayable, and fun and I feel like I got more than I paid for, but it mostly makes me look forward to paying 4.99 for a Bit Blaster XXL someday, one that's got a little more mechanical depth.

You still are in one screen for the whole battle, but now there are more powerups, more music tracks, and there is an option for auto-fire mode or manual fire.  I had more fun playing it again after the updates than I did when originally playing it for steam cards when I first got it. Have now changed rating from not recomended to thumbs up after updates. Nice to have a dev who updates and improves a game that had 96% positive rating to make it better for the people that did not originally enjoy it. End 2nd Edit.  Can see everything there is to see in 8 minutes. You are trapped on the starting screen like old school asteroids. The music is fine for the first level! Oh that is the only level.  Your ship has ammo and cannot stop firing, hope it doesn't run out. There is no progression, it will just be the same every time on that same box of a level.  Where are the steam cards???? They seem to be dropping slower on this game compared to other games..... EDIT: Cards all dropped now. Developer fixed card drop times after being alerted to issue on forum! This needs more than one short repeating music track, and better sound for weapons.  This game isn't bad, it is just very basic. The one soundtrack is okay but gets old fast. It is alright for the price, but the trading cards should really drop so much faster. Would have been happy if all the cards had dropped soon, just annoying to have to wait longer than the game warrants for them.","February 9","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The style is nice and the visuals are pleasant to look at, and the animations are simple yet fluid. The music is catchy but can get a little old especially when youre grinding credits for newer ships, especially since theres a song tied to each ship. The controls are a little stiff on keyboard but are a little bit better with a controller, it does make landing hits a bit harder (but that could be me only using the controller briefly).  If you want a cheap and fun game to kill time then I definitely recommend this. Its also available on iOS and Android. ------- Overall  Pros: -Nice simplistic 8bit inspired style -Nice music -Good controller support -Cheap price  Cons: -Keyboard controls are a little stiff -Music is tied to individual ships and can get a bit repetitive when youre grinding credits for new ships.","April 2","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is really fun and simple. There are plenty of weapon pickups with unique attacks, my favorite being the beam, though it has the trade off of being short.  There are unlockable ships too, with varying size, shooting speed, move speed, and shields, which determines how many hits you can take before death, though crashing into a wall will always insta-kill you.  As you play the game, little gold coins will either drop from enemies, or simply roll on screen. Collect them and use them to unlock the ships. First ship unlock costs 5 points, next one costs 10, and they keep increasing in cost by 5, with the current(as of this review) final ship costing 30.  This game is just incredibly fun and for only a dollar at most. I definitely recommend it.","February 11","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Which I'll go into right now...  Powerups:  There are all kinds of different power-ups that let you shoot different things, such as a shotgun, an exploding shot (fire work?) and a bouncing shot. I won't share all of them  since I think It's fun to try them all out for yourself. :)  Mechanics:  Similar to asteroids in which your character is constantly shooting and you just need to aim at the bad guys (in this case floating pizza)  Since you're constantly shooting, you need to pick up ammo from dead enemies. This provides enough reason to actually play the game instead of waiting for the best power-up to come  to you.  You can buy new ships which is really cool.  Ships: When you kill an enemy, sometimes they will drop a coin, collect enough of these and you can buy a new ship.  Ship Mechanics: You Have 3 abilities when it comes to ships: health, ship speed, and firing speed.

Don't expect to be sinking thousands of hours into this game, but it is a great throwback to the times of playing on arcade machines. It has a very cool and fitting soundtrack, and offers a solid amount of game time for $1.00. The one major downfall to this game is that it does not take long to unlock all of the available ships. After this, there is nothing else the game really has to offer besides constantly trying to beat your highscore.  TL;DR  This game is a fun, 8-bit space shooter with super simple controls, cool things to unlock as you "progress" in the game, super cheap price and great if you have some spare time, however it is lacking in large amounts of replayability, and will really only allow an hour or two of gameplay before the player may get bored.  8/10","January 25","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

More devs should follow suit.  The addition of two game modes supporting both auto fire and non-auto fire is such a simple thing, but it makes a huge difference by giving the player the option.  I found the selective firing method provided a gaming experience that made me feel much more in control of the game rather than before where it was just a monotonous exercise in moving around.  You can time your shots and WAIT for enemies to position based on the type of special powerups you have now.  Originally the simple premise of the game was part of its charm, but also highlighted some flaws.  Putting the timing of movement and firing back in the player's control adds that little strategy that was missing before.  For the price, now I would definitely recommend this game.   *Original Review below (Negative)*  I like the concept of the game, but after about 45 minutes, you'll have all the achievements (except the higher score ones) and nothing else to do.  Even something as simple as some score multipliers would keep the game fresh a little longer.  With that said, the thing that needs the most work is the auto-shooting.  I'm not entirely opposed to the auto-shooting mechanic.  I mean, it's the developers game so it's his/her choice, but one thing that is unsatisfactory about it is the fact that as soon as you press "start" to begin a game, there about 5-6 enemies that slowly spawn over about 30 seconds, but your ship is forced to shoot off in the distance for what boils down to probably a 10% accuracy rate simply because there is nothing to shoot.  Now, no one cares about accuracy, it's not even a stat to track in this game, but I bring it up because of the simple fact that there is no DEFAULT unlimited ammo so when you run out of ammo (because you're forced to shoot into the void remember?), you simply STOP SHOOTING.  That's it.  The game is a SHOOTER!  What should happen is one of two things:  1.  If you have a special weapon and run out of that type of ammo, your ship should default to regular unlimited bullets. 2.  If you don't have a special weapon, you should never run out of the default bullets.  (Think Contra for the NES).  I'll change my review if the default bullet issue is addressed.  It's just not fun.

More devs should follow suit.  The addition of two game modes supporting both auto fire and non-auto fire is such a simple thing, but it makes a huge difference by giving the player the option.  I found the selective firing method provided a gaming experience that made me feel much more in control of the game rather than before where it was just a monotonous exercise in moving around.  You can time your shots and WAIT for enemies to position based on the type of special powerups you have now.  Originally the simple premise of the game was part of its charm, but also highlighted some flaws.  Putting the timing of movement and firing back in the player's control adds that little strategy that was missing before.  For the price, now I would definitely recommend this game.   *Original Review below (Negative)*  I like the concept of the game, but after about 45 minutes, you'll have all the achievements (except the higher score ones) and nothing else to do.  Even something as simple as some score multipliers would keep the game fresh a little longer.  With that said, the thing that needs the most work is the auto-shooting.  I'm not entirely opposed to the auto-shooting mechanic.  I mean, it's the developers game so it's his/her choice, but one thing that is unsatisfactory about it is the fact that as soon as you press "start" to begin a game, there about 5-6 enemies that slowly spawn over about 30 seconds, but your ship is forced to shoot off in the distance for what boils down to probably a 10% accuracy rate simply because there is nothing to shoot.  Now, no one cares about accuracy, it's not even a stat to track in this game, but I bring it up because of the simple fact that there is no DEFAULT unlimited ammo so when you run out of ammo (because you're forced to shoot into the void remember?), you simply STOP SHOOTING.  That's it.  The game is a SHOOTER!  What should happen is one of two things:  1.  If you have a special weapon and run out of that type of ammo, your ship should default to regular unlimited bullets. 2.  If you don't have a special weapon, you should never run out of the default bullets.  (Think Contra for the NES).  I'll change my review if the default bullet issue is addressed.  It's just not fun.  Even for $0.99.","January 31","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

All in all if the game would let me move on my own, and bind the keys in which I see fit, and maybe if the area was larger (It feels very small and cramped), but also with more enemies to compensate, I would love this game.

Classic asteroidy action. Good fun.  Now for the real review.  Bit Blaster XL is a retro arcadey Asteroids-esque game. It's an incredibly well executed fast paced bullet hell, with a catchy arcade soundtrack and unlockables. Whats not to like? It takes a while to get used to the controls, simple as they are, so be prepared to smash into the walls a lot. There are a large number of upgrades to choose from, although they could be more accurately described as powerups given they appear at random. That said, without experience it is hard to tell what powerup does what, or even which ones would be useful. The fact that some of the powerup sprites are only differentiated by colour is not helpful, so be prepared also to spend a fair chunk of time swearing because you let the amazing Explosion powerup go for the terrible version of the shotgun powerup (for example).  The game also swiftly gets incredibly cluttered, although as I said this is a bullet hell game so what were you expecting. For this there are several useful powerups and several not so useful. Heres a list of my top 5 and one I never take, even if it means sticking with the peashooter they give you at the start. (Note: These are all my own names, given the lack of andy form of guide)   1.) Explosion/Lightsaber (Blue E and Green L respectively) depending on which ship you use. Fast ships go for lightsaber as a swift turn can cut through the bigass splitting asteroids really quickly, netting you a nice chunk of ammo. Otherwise go for the explosion, as it lingers for a bit and any enemies that walk into the field left  blow up too. 2.) Don't get me wrong, both of the above are incredibly useful on any ship, it's just that faster ships perform better with the lightsaber than slower ones. 3.) Homing balls (Orange H). This fires (at a cost of 5 ammo) an orange blob at a random enemy on screen, and lets you keep firing the standard gun. Useful, and given that each ammo drop gives you 5 ammo, as  long as you're quick enough this can go on forever. 4.) Ricochet (sorry can't remember the icon for this one). As the name says. Very useful, especially later, as there is no way they can miss with the number of enemies on screen. 5.) I agonized for a bit over this one, because there are a couple that are really good. But the last one is Multi (Orange M). This fires a shot to the front and the back. This is especially useful given the turning circle of some of the ships.  The one you should never, ever, ever go for :- M♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Purple M). The only boost this has, as far as I can tell, is making the ammo pickups drift towards you slightly quicker. Given that they do this anyway, and that it slows down the speed of your main weapon firing, it's just useless. Unless you want a challenge.","April 8","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nickervision makes some great games, and this is one of them. As I have enjoyed Pixel Boy in the past, this game is a simple homage to the retro arcade style shooter with simple controls. You can play on a keyboard, with just a mouse, or a controller (I have been playing on my USB SNES controller).  While quite infuriating at times, I find myself being rewarded quite often with different ships being unlocked. I also love seeing all the different weapons there are. My favorites being S(pread) and H(oming).  This is not a "Sit for hours and play" type of game, its just a simple coffee break "time to get your mind off of things" type of game. That's what makes it great for me.  -Pros- -Different ships to choose from give different advantages/disadvantages -Weapons are easily found by shooting enemies and asteroids -The music is great! -Controls are simple and easy to use/understand  -Cons- -The screen does fill up at points, making it difficult to see sometimes -There is no colorblind mode as of yet (Not colorblind, just noticed the red/green) -Ships take awhile to unlock (yet feel rewarding when you finally do unlock one)  Overall, I'd rate this game 9/10.

I originally found it on Reddit, and when I said I'd buy it the creator messaged me and gave me a code to get it free.  Originally posted by nickervision:Thanks a lot for the comment, I figured i'd save you the trouble of picking up Bit Blaster XL if you hadn't already. There's a free key for Steam. I hope you have some fun with it! I liked the gesture so much that I decided I'd buy the game rather than use the code anyways to support the game.  I also promissed to write a review for the game, but I wanted to wait for a while until I had more time spent in the game before writing my review. So here it goes!  I would definitely recommend this game! It seems simple enough, but it is incredibly addicting and I found it hard to stop playing when I really got into it. I got used to the controls very quickly, and found them to be simple but perfect for the game. I also really enjoyed the unlockable stuff, because it gave me a reason to keep playing rather than just trying to top my old high score. Each ship was different, so I liked how it kept the high scores for each ship separate. The different power ups were also fun, although some of them were clearly better than others. Then again it also depends on how you play so the diversity was great.  Edit: Oh yeah, and awesome music which made the game even more enjoyable. Made the game even more fun, and I'd personally be willing to download the soundtrack if the creator put it up for a small price :D  Overall an incredibly fun and addicting game with a great price (I honestly would have payed much more for it), and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a little something to mess around with.","April 25","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It could be completely irrelevant to you. Anyways, I just want to start off saying you should buy this game. For 99 cents, it's got a fair amount of content. And it's a simply good game. The gameplay is fair, with the enemies actually having a good ramping difficulty curve. The ships are fun to unlock, albeit the way you unlock them is a bit strange. You see, you collect coins to unlock them, but the coins are a random drop from enemies, so it's sort of non-linear. The pixelated graphics look nice, and the particles... are excellent. The music is fine, but I like some more than others (Looking at you, ship #4). Overall, this is a simply fun game to play and is definitely worth it.  However, with that being said, no game is perfect. And there is 1 complaint I feel I should express. The power-ups make no sense from my view. Their icon is a simple colored circle with a letter in it, so good luck guessing what it is. However, once you use it it's pretty simple to figure out what that letter stands for. R = Rapid Fire, L = Lazer, H = Helper(?). So the symbols aren't a huge issue, but their balance is a bit off. For example, remember the Helper power-up I just mentioned? It is very overpowered. It's an AI-controlled projectile that auto-tracks the enemies around you and kills them. It can only hit once, but one time I just dodged enemies while it ground everything into a mushy pulp, racking up ~2000 points in score. That score did not feel rewarding, it did most of the work. And then there's the Magnet power-up, which I avoid like the plague. It constantly sucks ammo, and because of the ammo cooldown timer you cannot fire right when you press the button to fire, making it difficult to time your shots. And it's magnet powers aren't that impressive, as you're constantly moving away from the ammo.  TL;DR: Buy the game if you can, it's amazing, avoid the purple M.","May 3","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cons: * Visually kind of bland. * No rebindable controls. Also heavily encourages 360 controllers by putting button prompts for them everywhere, but that's not as much of an issue and the game does show keyboard controls as well. * No pause. * The coin cost of the other ships seems a little high, and the ships themselves don't feel that different - there's 8, but there could've just been 4.  I got it for 50 cents, but a dollar sounds like an alright price as well if you know what you're paying for.

The style is nice and the visuals are pleasant to look at, and the animations are simple yet fluid. The music is catchy but can get a little old especially when youre grinding credits for newer ships, especially since theres a song tied to each ship. The controls are a little stiff on keyboard but are a little bit better with a controller, it does make landing hits a bit harder (but that could be me only using the controller briefly).  If you want a cheap and fun game to kill time then I definitely recommend this. Its also available on iOS and Android. ------- Overall  Pros: -Nice simplistic 8bit inspired style -Nice music -Good controller support -Cheap price  Cons: -Keyboard controls are a little stiff -Music is tied to individual ships and can get a bit repetitive when youre grinding credits for new ships.","April 2","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has a ton of weapons and space ships the enemies seem easy at first but get much harder (mainly because it's hard to aim) People complain about ships not having tight turning but that is a stat for each ship its speed determines its turning the high health ones turn like a tank (no duh). I normally play this game with auto fire on so I have less buttons to press just pick up ammo from dead enemies. This game has a great difficulty curve not too hard to put people off not too easy to be boring. This game is amazing and with its 49 cent price tag (on sale of course) I got it by selling my steam cards making the game cost me basically nothing to get.

Usually, mobile games don't translate well onto PCs. But Bit Blaster made proof that many gamers got it wrong with this one. Bit Blaster XL does what other mobile games to PC got it all wrong. Heck, I even got addicted to it. Now, 17 achievements, leaderboards, and even makes it great for 0.99 cents. (or, if you are in the UK, £0.79)  Sometimes, your game doesn't HAVE to be a AAA game or even a big indie game, like Braid or Terraria, to be great and fun. And Bit Blaster XL shows proof. If you have some spare change left on your wallet, go ahead. Get the game and get addicted!","May 30","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you don't know what to play when you are bored, launch this up. This is an extremely awesome game which can really throw retro players back to the good old 80's (not me). The enemies are challenging and the game is "heating up" when you get above 10k. Oh, and the ammo count is also a challenge :) The game itself is pumped up with many major updates, especially the V2.00 which is my opinion makes the game more enjoyable. Also, the soundtrack is good for the ear and it can cure cancer. So, overall, >10/10.

This game is brilliant. Gameplay is extremely well balanced, it's not too easy, and it's not too hard either, it's just a very fun challenge of a space shooter. Plus this works really well on a gamepad, which is a huge plus for that retro feel of gameplay. Quite a varied amount of ships to play with, some locked, as you pick up in game coin icons that are hidden in certain asteroids etc... then you can purchase the other ships with your earned credit. I highly recommend this game to any gamer that loves these kind of shooters, 10/10 from me, very fun and has that one more go factor about it, that really does shine in the gameplay.","June 2","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What makes this game different: Random powerups, auto-fire is bad because you can run out of ammo. Unlike asteroids you can never come to a complete stop.  The edges of the map are a boundary you can not pass and will crash into.  Worth checking out when it's on sale if you're looking for a nintendo hard 80s style asteroid.

The fantastic pixel art blends perfectly with the really catchy music that chirps away as you blast astriods and enemy spaceships.  The sense of progression is simple, as it should be in this retro style game, and doesn't feel overwhelmingly grindy - although it is essentially what you're doing. The weapons really stand out too - Some are your average three-way bullets, or your slightly bigger ones - but there are some really intuitive weapons too. My personal favourite is the lazor sword, which is bloody perfect as long as you manage your ammo.  Oh - This game also has ammo. Yeah, it's an odd mechanic to add into an endless shooter like this, but it works really well. You can have your shooting set to automatic, which is really handy when you just want to focus on getting out of annoying situations, but I prefer to play with this turn off. One addition that I feel would really help the game feel much smoother would be the ability to toggle this function on and off during a game - Maybe binding it to 'Y' or 'B' on the controller? That way, one can switch their focus from gaining points and swerving to dodge the debris that quickly fills your screen.  Overall, if you think you like the look of this, you'll probably have tonnes of fun with it. And why not? It's under £1~  -Ashe","June 2","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is the kind of game that makes blowing up ships and destroying asteroids with missiles and lasers very satisfying. There are several upgrades that you can get in-game that give you an initial point bonus and improve your attack, or there's one that helps you collect ammo/points. I've got to say, my favorite is either the one that turns your projetiles into a laser that you wave around like a sword, or the one that makes you launch bombs that blow up even more ships/asteroids.

Unlockables make the game more satisfying, while also beating your high score gets quickly addicting. You can play this game when you have just a few short moments to play, or for several hours at a time.

The game is based on the arcade games, a great classic. Here you have to show your oldschool skills, being fast, coordinating your moves and aiming in an exact time.  Game price. It's actually not bad, $1 for a permanent legal copy of an arcade game is acceptable. Though, it'd be an amazing thing if devs kept this updated (Like they are doing for now!) adding new spaceships, backgrounds, etc.  My personal opinion. Based on the fact it was made by a starter indie team, feels good to support buying their nice game. It's not buggy, includes Steam Trading Cards and Achievements.  A good suggestion: The textures should be 3D, or at least the spaceship and meteors should be voxel'd. Though this could mean a lot of time i am sure this could be a greater and more atractive game.

How can you go wrong. The game has great pixel graphics, you could run this on your mothers toaster. The gameplay is very simple, you could teach this game to a person whos never played a game in their life. You turn left and right, and you press a button to boost. Thats it. As you go objects fly past you and and green pickups that refill your ammo as you are constantly shooting. There are also powerup weapons that come along and change your shot type, this offers variety to the game and you arent stuck with the same straight line shot every run. The longer you stay alive shooting objects and ships the more harder it gets, spawn rates increase, harder enemies come along and the whole screen is basically flooded with stuff to dodge and manouver. When you die you can return to the ship selection where you can unlock new "bit blasters" with the yellow coins you collect in runs. Each ship has different stats but as you progress that ships become slightly better every time. Another thing i like about this game is when you die you can just hit one button and youre back in the game again, no uneccesary screens to go through, however it takes a while for the difficulty to ramp up back to where the game is actually fun. After you unlock all the ships the only thing to go for is to increase your high score which is ok but i think there still should be some more progression after unlocking everything. I know this is a 1 dollar game but i dont know what to do with all my coins. But yeh this game is pretty much the best $1 you will spend in along time and you can basically guarantee you will get you "dollars worth" out of the game.","January 25","true","13.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Do you like Asteroids?  Do you like Luftrausers?  This game is a great blend of the two, with the classic feel of blowing up space debris but with a variety of ships and powerups to help you along the way.  The gameplay is very engaging, and when you inevitably die, you get pulled right back in for another round.  On top of that, the sound track is incredible, and changes with each ship!  Each track has a lively beat that ramps up as you play, and fits very well with the fast paced nature of the game.  Something that I really appreciate in this game, that so many others of this genre don't have, is the ability to toggle auto-fire.  The constant "pew-pew-pew" of similar games can feel repetitive and grating, but Bit Blaster lets you decide which mode you would prefer when you select your ship.  There are also separate high scores for each ship, and for each fire mode as well!

The gameplay is very engaging, and when you inevitably die, you get pulled right back in for another round.  On top of that, the sound track is incredible, and changes with each ship!  Each track has a lively beat that ramps up as you play, and fits very well with the fast paced nature of the game.  Something that I really appreciate in this game, that so many others of this genre don't have, is the ability to toggle auto-fire.  The constant "pew-pew-pew" of similar games can feel repetitive and grating, but Bit Blaster lets you decide which mode you would prefer when you select your ship.  There are also separate high scores for each ship, and for each fire mode as well!  For less money (and calories) than a dollar menu sandwich, Bit Blaster XL is an absolute riot of a good time!","April 8","true","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

And it's good! My gripes were mostly with the turning radius and autofire leading to a lot of frustrating deaths and ultimately feeling like the game is mostly out of your hands. Now, even though I still kind of suck at it, it's entirely my own fault when I explode and that makes for a much more rewarding experience. With that in mind I also rescind my comment that a brake would be better than a turbo, since the brake might actually be too overpowered.  It's a buck, it's simple and its mobile heritage is evident but now it feels like it works as its own thing. That and the dev is crazy proactive.","January 23","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

That's the main thing everyone seems to say in this game's favor. "Well, it didn't cost me anyhting!"  I wanted to like this game but found it simplistic, unenjoyably limited, and lacking strategy. The game artificially limits you in ways that games like Asteroids (yeah, that one, from the 1980s) doesn't. Let that sink in for a moment.  In this game, you are constantly moving forward. You cant stop or vary your speed below the minimum threshold of thrust/velocity. The only thing you can do is boost to further speed up, but once you unlock the 2nd ship, it's already too fast even without boost.  This causes a problem with another limitation that Asteroids didn't have - in Bit Blaster, if you touch the edges of the screen, you die instantly, rather than wrapping around to the other side (you know, a feature that is actually fun).  Finally, in this game you are forced to constantly shoot at an automated rate, which removes all strategy from aiming and placing precise shots, and is further compounded by the fact that ammo is severely limited and once you run out, you literally cant fire at anything until you pick up more ammo, which drops as loot from things that you destroy (see the catch 22?).  I guess other people like those features but to me they are pointless limitations that ruin any sense of strategy or fun. This game forces you to play by its rules at all times, in direct contravention to the established rules of this genre since basically the beginning of video game time. Sorry, but I didn't like it and do not recommend it.","June 4","false","0.1"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrickoBanna/recommended/433950/","BrickoBanna","Just_Another_Brick (>^_^)>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrickoBanna/","315 products in account","Definitely not the best game on steam, not even the best of its genre. The dev was very nice when I talked to him and you cant beat the $1 price, but in its current state the game doesnt engage me enough to keep me coming back.  Its difficult for me to make a negative review because I cant hide behind the lens of anonymity since I’ve talked to the dev, but I can’t in good conscious recommend this game in its current state and I will try to give an accurate overview on why:  -uninspired developer art, pixel art can look very good if done well, but the current art is almost temp art, simplistic to the point of being boring.  -completely average uninteresting powerups. Other than the lightsaber, all powerups amount to different colored pixels, travelling in different patterns. Also there are no real upgrades in this game, other than a shield. Powerups are always the same and disappear when you run out of ammo, so no upgrading your weapon or anything like that.  -little to no satisfaction/ user feedback. Destroying things in this game doesn’t create huge explosions or display (500 POINTS!, COMBO) no things just sort of split or disappear creating a few white pixels around them, when they are destroyed. This makes the game feel unsatisfying to play and there is not a feeling of accomplishment.  -awkward movement. Controls do not feel smooth, it is like trying to pilot an r/c car with a dying battery. When you play a game with fluid controls you really feel in control of your character, this game is the opposite. Auto fire is on by default so you don’t have control over your shots and waste 90% of your ammo, and the ships have a turning radius of a large boat.  I love the arcade, score attack genre, but this is not an example of a game that has done this well. I only have <30 mins in this game and some users may think this invalidated my review, but this is precisely the point, I have tried to play the game many time and am just not interested, I feel like I have experienced everything this game has to offer in 20 mins of playtime. A good score attack game keeps you coming back, this one feel extremely unsatisfying.  Here are some games I think are much better examples of the arcade/score attack genre and I recommend you check out: Geometry Wars, Super House of Dead Ninjas, RaidenX (Free online flash game), Super Crate Box.  I wish the dev the best and I mean no ill will with this review, I just want to give an accurate view about my opinions on his game. I gave him some suggestions that I would love to see implemented, and I am certainly willing to give this game another chance and re-review it if any of my criticisms have changed. If you are enjoying the game in its current state then more power to you.","April 26","false","0.2"," 22 of 68 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","22","68","0","1"

Upgrades are either dull or bad, and they run out when you run out of ammo. Which you will, because a game like this dares to have limited ammo. At the very least, your base attack should be infinite, and the upgrades are limited. And you WILL run out of ammo, because auto-fire. Running into the edge of the map also kills you, which is easy to do since your turning is so poor. Interesting idea with the Asteroids-style setup, but needs lots of improvements.","May 27","false","0.4"," 5 of 29 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","5","29","0","5"
