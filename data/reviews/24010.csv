There are really nice things about it and really awful things, the latter being more abundant but I'll still split this into a pros and cons review. I will admit that until fairly recently I thought this was a good simulator until I learned more about how locomotive systems actually work and found alternative simulation programs. This review is based on what I now know. Also I feel I should mention that I almost never run Steam Locomotives, so I can't comment on that aspect.\n\nHere's what this game does RIGHT:\n-GRAPHICS: To my knowledge, better than other trains sims in terms of lighting, quality of objects/models, and simulation of movement (head/cab shaking)\n-AMOUNT OF ADD-ONS: Yes, I'm counting this as a pro, but only the availability aspect. See below for everything else about DLC. There is a decent variety of content, albeit only for UK, US, and GER.\n-ROUTES: Some (SOME!!!) of these are really well made and scenarios from the workshop make them better.\n-WORKSHOP: Integrated much better into this game than others (such as a mod made by someone named Garry). There is some really good content on here from users who care about making good scenarios.\n\nHere's what this game does WRONG:\n-Complete disregard for quality control. Majority of available DLC should not have been released as-is. This applies mostly to older routes (those have drastically improved lately) and nearly all locomotives. More info on this below.\n-Refusal to fix bugs. I don't think ONE problem that I have with my content has been fixed since I first got this game. What does get “fixed” is stuff no one gives a dookie about like the passengers having their clothes change depending on the season and “improving” their AI on platforms. I swear to god this was one of the embarrassingly small number of changes DTG advertised from 2013 to 2014, and even that just broke more things (now passengers will float in mid-air and run around in little circles!). Only other change I can remember them saying was the menu interface. Wow, thanks. So glad that got worked on and not the completely broken air brake simulation.\n-Accuracy of simulation.  To my knowledge... not so good. Brake systems behave completely wrong. Slack forces between cars are unpredictable and inconsistent. Amperage vs. engine speed often seems off.\n-Price to play. DLC is way overpriced (ALL of it), and the base game comes with almost nothing, so you're forced to buy more add-ons if you want to have any fun and be able to play scenarios from the workshop. Seriously this is the worst part. There is no excuse for the cost of add-ons. They cost as much as full games which require 200x more work and testing and NEVER get cheaper. Sure once or twice a year a handful of them will go on sale, but what's the point of that if during this last March Madness sale I saw DLC where the original price was raised before taking the 20 or 30% off. I face-palmed instantly.\n\nWhile there are definitely some good things here (the base engine of the game is fine), all the problems that are continually piles on top of them completely cancels those few pros out and renders me unable to recommend it to fellow train enthusiasts and simulation fans.\n\nIt also seems like DTG has disabled the ability to review DLC (because no one would buy it), so here is a bonus review of the DLC I have been (for the most part) SUCKERED into buying.\n\n-CAJON PASS: Bad. Lack of signage, bare minimum of buildings in towns, no smooth gradient changes, a few turns where the track speed is dangerously high, no track speed reduction for crossovers.\n-DASH 9: Absolutely horrible. LCD's in dash display NO info, traction is too powerful, sounds are weak, brake cylinder pressure is always 0 on HUD, dynamic brake is so overpowered it will derail your train at over 25%\n-EAST COAST MAIN LINE: Lacking detail in scenery. It's just OK.\n-F40PH CALI ZEPHYR: Terrible physics, same dynamic brake problem as Dash9. Luckily there is a 3rd party fix from railworks america. Rolling stock included drags as if the handbrake were stuck on each car.\n-LONDON-FAVERSHAM HIGH-SPEED: Short route, but very detailed. Signage is good and dynamic signaling system on CTRL works well. Included stock is pretty good, although sounds for the class 395 are really bad. Overall this one's pretty good.\n-LONDON-BRIGHTON: Like this route, class 377 has good physics but no 2-tone horn. Annoying.\n-MARIAS PASS: I really like this route, can't really say anything bad about it. This was about the turning point for route quality. The included GE ES44DC is also one of the best locos for the game. It's the only one I have where the dynamic brake works like it should. Other systems work better than most, but still aren't perfect.\n-MUNICH-AUGSBURG: Same boat as London-Faves. Short but detailed, PZB/LZB is good. Comes with ICE-3 so you don't have to buy it separate.\n-PACIFIC SURFLINER: Route itself is amazing. Very detailed and accurate, the best one I own. The EMD F59PHI included has major problems with physics and air brakes. Exterior sounds are good, interior bad.\n-NEC/ACELA: Complete lack of signage, impossible scenarios, unsmoothed gradients, track speed too high at some points. Acela has problems such as auto brake-blending not working. AEM-7 is decent.\n-PORTSMOUTH DIRECT LINE: Decent length route with acceptable detail. There are many branches on the route that are unfinished which is very weird. Included rolling stock has horrible physics especially with the brakes. I dare say they don't work.\n-CLASS 70: Horrible physics all-around, impossible scenarios, nice model and exteriors sounds though...\n-DONNER PASS: Nice and long, detail is OK, scenarios are terrible (some impossible), included locos are really bad.\n-HORSESHOE CURVE: No signage at all, no track speed reduction for crossovers, included locos have worst physics ever, location markers are confusingly named, stock scenarios are decent.\n-ISLE OF WIGHT: Terribly short for price, impossible scenarios included, no detail on or in rolling stock.\n-RURH-SIEG + SEEBERGBAHN: Just bad. Don't get either. Also no workshop scenarios.\n-SD70 VOL.2: I was so mad after I bought this. All the same problems as Dash9 plus more! The head and ditch lights don't actually emit light! I don't get why this is so bad when the SD70-M that was included with Sherman Hill was fine.\n-SHERMAN HILL: This route's pretty good, signage is decent but not much detail in towns. Included rolling stock and scenarios are pretty good. Lots of workshop support.\n-SP GP20: Hands down the best locomotive for this game (probably 'cause it's 3rd party). Physics are great on traction and all brake systems, sounds are nice, startup procedure emulation, engine overheating, etc. all adds more realism than any other add-on. This is a must-have if you want real simulation and proves that the base game system CAN support good simulation; just that no effort goes into the content!\n-SP/UP SD45: Physics are okay, offers more in-cab interaction than most, sounds are bad (except exterior engine). Needs more scenarios, barely any in workshop.\n-WEST COAST MAINLINE NORTH: This route is pretty good except one major problem—the track speed on most of it is DANGEROUSLY high. Like so high I feel I'm going to derail when going 30mph under. I don't know if the curves are supposed to be banked or if the speed is just wrong. Class 86 is one of my favorite locos to run because of the tap system.\n\nThat's all the DLC I own. I've been afraid to buy any more since the last two I bought were really bad. And that's too bad because I really do want some of the new routes and locos that have come out recently, but I would hate myself if I gave DTG any more money and would probably go crazy if they turned out to be bad, which there is a great chance of that.","April 2, 2014","false","939.7"," 1,765 of 1,938 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","765","1","0","44"

You play for a while and kinda get interested, but it doesn't take long until you see the massive amount of flaws and disgusting customer service it has. I've now uninstalled it and I certainly won't be buying any additional content ever again.\n\nFirst, what does it get right?\n+ Lots of DLC which means a huge amount of content to play with (see cons though)\n+ Fairly easy to understand and get into\n+ Steam workshop expands the playtime hugely\n\nSo what does it get wrong?\n- Physics are terrid, and in no way represent any sort of realism\n- This is not really a simulator since there is only about 5 buttons in the cab that work..\n- Crap optimisation. Framerate dips below 20 sometimes. Probably due to lack of multi-core support.\n- Tile loading system. This means the game micro-freezes each time it loads a new tile.\n- Sounds are often inaccurate and poor quality, and they copy and paste them from train to train.\n- Way too many bugs that they won't fix.\n- DLC is overpriced. Where do they get these prices from?\n- They reskin a train, call it a new one and sell it for another £11.99..\n- Graphics are OKAY in areas, but horrid in others.\n- Level of quality is inconsistent.\n- They force advertising of their next DLC down your throat any chance they get. On the menu, on the loading screen..\n- Customer support just ignores you or gives you false promises.\n\nCould go on for a while. It's a game that has a lot of potential, but the devs are too busy concentrating on treating their customers like cattle and chugging out new DLC rather than patching the game, and fixing existing DLC.","May 3, 2015","false","205.6"," 752 of 842 people (89%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","89","752","842","52","31"

Most of them were put on in 2011 and 2012.\n\nThis game is based off an outdated physics engine, using textures that are years old, by a company with a business model that puts that of PAYDAY 2 to shame. Just look at all the DLC. If I foolishly press "ADD ALL TO CART"... I am left with 232 items totalling upwards of $3000. I'm not joking, and here's a screen capture to prove it.[i.imgur.com] (For the record, if you foolishly add all DLC to cart, you can clear your cart by going into Steam's settings, to 'web browser' then hitting 'delete all browser cookies.)\n\n(Edit for clarification 2016-02-21: That screen-capture was taken during a sale and is actually a thou or so under the current price for DLC. /edit)\n\nEach new iteration, all we get are UI changes and more DLC.

I can not yet review TS2015 because the compulsory re-branding (free upgrade) has broken my installation completely, I'm not sure I can be bothered to re-install TS from scratch, but If I do I will review TS2015 then.\nALSO NOTE: (for the hard of intellect) The ingame hours listed above are from TS2013 a version of this simulator I would reccommend, unfortuantely later versions of TS are compulsory and cannot be avoided. which is the main reason I dont reccommend TS and why the following review is still relevant.\n\n\nTS is a hybrid, existing somewhere between game and simulator, because this gamulator lives in this middle ground anyone interested in casually driving trains for XP or serious rail simulation fans looking for the experience of driving a train like real driver in a simulated environment or those like myself with an interest in creating scenarios and routes may be frustrated in equal measure, however for very different reasons.\n\nTS2014 is not a new product, its a compulsory upgrade from TS2013 which was a compulsory upgrade from TS2012 and so on.\n\nTS2013 can be used off the shelf as a ready to play product, in this form it works adquately but its very limited in scope, to get any meaningful use from TS2014 requires a serious financial investment in some of the DLC (depending on your area of interest) and an investment in time in making your own content in the form of scenarios and routes. For anyone interested in simulating reality making your own scenarios using the editor is essential, this is probably TSs strongest aspect  however if you undertake this you will come up against many of the software’s myriad bugs and design limitations, the process can be encapsulated in one word: "Frustrating” however it can be rewarding when you do discover a work-around for any of the problems you will encounter.\n\nTS also suffers from (in my experience):\n*Poor unhelpful patronising support with less than a rudimentary understanding of the product.\n*Falling value for money in packs that come with less skins than previous releases and routes released without the common stock that use them, Ubiquitous stock is conspicuous in its absence while the developers release rare and one-off locos.\n*A complexity of incompatible assets, and cut down incompatible replacements for withdrawn DLC making the sharing of scenarios impractical. (for instance there are 5! different versions of the class 66, all incompatible with each other!)\n*Variable quality in DLC from “outstanding” to “not-fit-for-purpose”, some DLC cannot be driven without using the driver interface, because of little omissions like the sounds of doors closing not being included, this is bad news if you want full immersion. The sounds on some of the DLC are diabolical others less so.\n*A game menu UI that is a temple to style over functionality.\n*Long standing unresolved bugs including, benign graphical bugs such as floating passengers and more serious CTD session ending bugs such as the corrupted asset in the scenery folder of London to Brighton that crashes the editor.\n*Aggressive marketing, in-your-face advertising and the monetisation of almost every aspect, you are spammed with advertising when waiting for scenarios to load and you cannot even work towards achievements without investing in DLC\n*Widespread censorship of genuine concerns on official channels, giving other users advice on workarounds or patches for bugs is prohibited.\n*Design limitations, such as its impossible to create “late running” scenarios because the software wont allow the pick-up of passengers from a stop you arrive late at and a save and resume system that can cause AI to be mistimed, collide, derail and off-path in scenarios.\n*Unless you have a powerful set up you will have to chose between graphical quality or performance, if you take the performance route TS is ugly but it can be pretty if you don’t mind some stuttering.\n\nAll of these things you should not expect from a premium priced product but can be overlooked or worked around if you are a serious rail simulator buff, I would still recommend this product even with these (and other) Shortcomings.\n\nHowever:\n\nThe reason I cannot recommend TS2014 is confidence. Every autumn there is a compulsory relaunch of the product, Its called a “Free update” and in general it carries new ways to monetise the software, some new bugs and a few “bread and circuses” changes, the important part of this is the software changes and unless you want to isolate yourself from ever using the product again you have no choice in accepting it. [EDIT: On the 6th Jan my last working copy of TS2013 was automaticly upgraded bypassing Steam disabled automatic updates, It appears its not actually possible to prevent the update at all, only delay it by a few months. the updates are fully compulsory, as a customer you have no choice]\nBecause things change every year it has completely smashed my confidence in the product, how long before it becomes intentionally or accidentally unusable? There is no way of knowing if all the hours that may have spent on scenario creation or weeks of gaining achievements or months on route building or the considerable amount of money spent on DLC will just be wasted or unusable a few years down the line.\nI find this single aspect utterly demoralising, I simply can no longer be motivated to spend time creating something that may in future be taken away from me without my consent, in this sense its a self fulfilling prophesy.\n\nThe release of TS2014 has turned a flawed but enjoyable entertainment (TS2013) into my biggest ever regret, I feel like I have been conned. All the hours I spent making scenarios and routebuilding in TS2013 have been wasted because I have been forced to "upgrade" to TS2014.\n\nNot recommended, unless you are a masochist.\n\nEDIT: 4/12/2013, I think the fact that Railsimulator marked this and many other reviews as "off topic" says more than I could ever say about TS. Actions speak louder than words.\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/2013/12/06/train-simulator-2014-developer-hiding-negative-steam-user-reviews-flagged-as-off-topic/\n\nEDIT: 6/12/2013 Steam moderators overturned DTGs off topic flagging and made this review visable again.","December 2, 2013","false","438.4"," 897 of 1,073 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","897","1","0","58"

The game still carries on issues from it's first release five years back which never got touched at all. I admit most of these are smaller issues and none is gamebreaking so far, but when the update policy is so low, I wonder if a gamebreaking bug might be fixed at all.

Bearing in mind, I've played Sonic 06, Megaman & Bass, Spyro: Enter The Dragonfly just no name a few. TS2016 doesn't even qualify for the "So bad it's good" tier or even the visualy pleasing tier and has been simply getting worse and worse every year. Some of the problems I have with this game are as follows:\n\n- Appauling opimization on high end computers. I've heard reports of people with GTX 960s having various issues with this game.\n- No DX12 support or DX11 support.\n- No Rebinable controls. In 2015.\n- Most of the features, such as Career Mode, serve no purpose. The XP points you recieve do bugger all at the end of the day. Unlike in Pokemon, Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger where XP points actually help you grow stronger in the game.\n- Unrealistic physics.\n- A very unstable engine. One could say you have a 50/50 chance of the game crashing whilst driving.\n- Terrible loading times.\n- Lack of respect for the source material for trains and routes (Great Western Mainline, North London Line and London To Brighton are good examples of this.)\n- The game's downright INSULTING model for DLC. No, seriously, it's one of the worst. The company shove out DLC on a very frequent basis. Trains most of the time have unrealistic physics, sounds, consist formations and a lack of features. Routes are usually short, linear and offer the player to drive on...about 1 or 2 full services. Again, unacceptable for the money they're charging.\n\nBut by far the worst thing about this game is the company itself. As evidenced by the amount of DLC (totaling £3000+ mind you), they clearly only care about the money as trains have a sporadic field of quality, old routes are almost never updated with the new features and they constantly clog up the game with more content, in an attempt to say that "They listen to us" or "We do want to improve." The game is also becoming more and more of a casual scrub slideshow simulator than a freaking train simulator, with things such as Railfan Mode, which has been done before by members of the community and Career mode, which has zero gameplay purpose. Even after sending an E-mail to Dovetail Games, they for some reason, didn't manage to properly defend the purpose of Career Mode or Railfan Mode. I wonder why...\n\nOut of the goodness of my heart, please, I emplore you, DO NOT buy this video game. You'll save yourself time, money, headaches and most importantly, sanity. You could end up becoming like me, sitting around making podcasts where I tear this game to shreads on Youtube. It ain't as fun as it sounds.\n\nFor the developers of this game, I shall leave you with an altered quote from Jesse Owens.\n\n"We all have dreams.

The first is that I like trains. They're great. This game is a pretty old game and I've owned it since about 2009/2010. I've probably clocked some 3-400 hours of playtime on this, as I have developed my own routes and driven trains up and down the existing routes. That still leaves 1700 hours. This is due to a glitch in the earlier game. It used to leave a process running that I never noticed that told steam that I was still "in-game" even when I was sleeping or out at uni/work. This wasn't patched until very recently.\nAs I said in the earlier part of this review - This used to be a good game. Right up until DTG started doing an EA on us. So, to the people not understanding how I've played it for 2000 hours and I don't recommend it, there's your answer. If I'd reviewed it in the 2010, I would've wholeheartedly recommended it. Oh and it's always good to see some intelligent criticism of this review. Calling me a "douch(sic)" because I don't agree with you isn't going to ameliorate me to your cause. Can we have some maturity please.\n\n\nReview\nRighty-oh, think I'll jump on the bandwagon. I've owned Railworks (or Rail Simulator, Train Simulator 20xx) since 2010. Back then it was Railworks 2. We forgave it it's shortcomings. It trumped MSTS on features (for the time), was slightly pretty (even if it was behind everything else) but we were still in the warm glow of the community led MSTS days. A time when UKTrainsim flourished with add-ons, and near enough every class of British locomotive, DMU, EMU, DEMU etc was represented. We were expecting the same with Rail Simulator (as it was back then). I remember the posts on UKTrainsim's forums about how there was going to be community support, that if we all cobbled together we could develop our own content and it would be MSTS with a much improved physics and graphics engine.\n\n4 (maybe 7) years on, and oh how things changed. First they took our HUD. That thing was good. Throttle display on one side, brakes and others. It was non-intrusive, fitted well and meant you could happily drive the train from an external view. That went. We tolerated the new HUD. It had more features but it was clunkier and intruded on the display.\nUktrainsim published it's expansion packs. Which have remained in pretty much the same form to this day. They were good. A good starting point. They were free which was fantastic. But they were killed away.\n\nRailworks was rebranded as Train Simulator. Imagine my (non) surprise when I booted it up and nothing had changed apart from the overlays. It was laggier, and my content didn't work as well. But I forgave it this. They promised patches that never emerged. Instead we got more and more DLC. Trains that no-one wanted. Routes that made no sense. Train Simulators 2012, 2013, 2014 and now 2015 passed and the same base game, but less compatibility. Less focus on community content that didn't feature payware DLC (even on Uktrainsim, the once bastion of free content). The broken features from Rail Simulator remained. The crap dispatcher. The recycled sounds and features. The HST has remained in that form since the first game - update anyone?\n\nFinding fixes for relatively minor problems has been a continuous, frustrating and in some cases, fruitless exercise. Especially when it came to content creation. Scenarios that fail for seemingly arbitrary reasons. Non-negotiable (even by mashing G) pathing on freeroam scenarios that will place an express in a 40mph freight loop. The way that the game has two signalling systems for UK routes that don't talk to one another. One that is a pain to set up and one that isn't. In 2011, I started developing a midland mainline route for this game. That went nowhere because we got updated to TS2012 in the middle and I lost the ability to easily edit the route.\n\nAnd to finally ice the cake, with the release of TS2015 and it's subsequent patch, I managed to lose a partition on my hard disk due to a bad file downloaded from Steam. Bye bye 2 years of research. Thank goodness for back ups.\n\nIf I could say that I have gained anything from TS, it is the following. I am a theoretical chemist. I use the high level software on a supercomputer to compute quantum chemical properties. In many ways, using this is a lot like using the content creator on TS2015. It's broken, and if you don't do it exactly right it will fail, but when it does work, it is the most satisfying feeling in the world. Shame it only happens every few months.\n\nPeople, don't buy this game. Don't buy the add-ons. Leave it alone. Move on to OpenBVE if you want realism, OpenRail if you want features.\n\nOh and DTG, if you want to save this sinking ship, stop trying to monetise everything. Let the community create more non-DLC dependent freeware. Stop selling reskins as separate DLC. Basically, stop treating your (otherwise) loyal fanbase like chumps. We were loyal to begin with, but we will move on to other programs that don't treat us as walking wallets.\n\nEDIT: doing more investigation into TS2015. Even more of my DLC doesn't work. And my JT voyager seems to have vanished entirely.

I was a member on UKTS and a proper modoholic. I bought several addon CDs (yes, CDs. Remember those?) with routes because it was the only practical way to distribute them at that time.\n\nThen Rail Simulator came out, I can't even remember when, and it pretty much killed my interest in the genre. That sounds a little over-dramatic, I know. But the thing was, there was all this content for MSTS (Microsoft Train Simulator), but the graphics and physics were awful and the game engine was really struggling even with contemporary hardware.  Then there was Rail Simulator, which had pretty (for the day) graphics, but no user made content. Each one spoiled the other for me. So I stopped playing, and vowed to come back once the community had matured. I wasn't good at content creation myself, so I thought I could be a bit selfish like that and get away with it, and the developers were promising to work with the community and provide all these tools and so on and so forth.\n\nWhen was that, 2007? I'm writing this in 2015 and all I see is overpriced DLC and what is, essentially, the same game as Rail Simulator. In fact, some of the content is even *exactly* the same. Those god awful sounds for the HST? Those are from 8 years ago, and they were well below par back then, too. I mean, I know that this has essentially been a rolling update, from Rail Simulator to Railworks to Train Simulator, 2011, 2013, 2014 and so on, but this is pretty sad.\n\nI don't know what happened to the community in the years I was away, but it seems to have died a death. All I know is from reading other reviews. They're talking about the developers refusing to engage with the community, except as a cash cow. I don't know how true the former is, but the latter is obviously true.\n\nGo and look at all the DLC available, then look at the price. OK, got that? Well, maybe if you end up using this content a lot, like maybe the buses in OMSI, then it might be worth it, right? Now look at the scenarios included with the DLC. That's all you're going to get, dear. There is no way to set up a timetable and just drive it with AI traffic. You either go free roam, or the 4 or 5 pre-packaged scenarios (which may also rely on other DLC, watch out for that), or the same scenarios but with a score logged at the end. Thanks for the £25, good bye, don't let the door hit you on the way out. You know how in a game like OMSI you can just get in there and drive at any time of the day you want, with the weather you want, on the line you want, and the game just makes everything else up for you and you can have a happy bus-filled extravaganza of mid-80s German-ness? Yeah, that's not what you get here. You will exhaust these scenarios, and then you will be done.\n\nBut wait! What about Steam Workshop? Good luck. Good luck finding anything that works with what ever selection of DLC you've happened to buy. In my experience, it's useless. Yes, this is something that plagued MSTS as well, but good god that game came out in 2001 and hasn't been developed since. That games gets slack. This thing has been in constant development for more than 8 years. Let that one sink in. This is 8 years worth of work, and it's still the same pre-made, finite, static content as it ever was. Oh, but there's bloom effects, so that's nice.\n\nSo, enough about the overpriced content and lack of community. What about the game engine itself, what about the environment? The content may be limited, but perhaps we can immerse ourselves in what we have, and really enjoy it for what it is.\n\nNa. Sorry. The game engine looks ok, yes. But it's just "OK", and that's not really 8 years worth of work, is it? It still looks reminiscient of Rail Simulator back in the day, but now it has some slightly fancy lighting effects. In fact I was going to start talking more about some of the nice graphical things they've added since the original game, but I actually can't think of any off the top of my head. It just looks like it did back then but now it runs worse. Although, there is the bloom. There is always the bloom. If you smudge vaseline on the lens, that makes it look all realistic and next-gen, right?\n\nOK, what ever, I'll stop moaning, turn on my TrackIR and-oh wait, there's no TrackIR support.\n\n....Fine. You know what? Why do we even need TrackIR on a train sim, It's only one of the main components for immersion in first person simulator games, but I suppose I'm just looking straight ahead most of the time anyway. I'll just get my controller out and have fun with that instead. I've got some nice realistic analoge controls set up here that I can use for the throttle, brake and so on. It will be so much better than using the bizarre keyboard layout. Boo for digital controls, am I right?\n\nMy god. Why is the "controller" menu just a picture of an XBox controller? Is this a joke? Well, maybe I just rebind it in the main menu instead, it's probably just a reminder of the assignments I've already set up and... wait, there's no way to even rebind the keys?!\n\nThis is a 2015 release of a PC simulator game, and you can't even rebind the keys.\n\nI give up. You win, Dovetail. You win. 6/5 stars, game of the year, game of the century, take my money, take my dignity, take my god knows how long I spent writing this review. Learn from my mistakes.\n\nI'll be in the corner sobbing into my old copy of Microsoft Train Simulator like the sad, sad person that I am.","January 7, 2015","false","73.4"," 227 of 252 people (90%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","90","227","252","49","16"

However the last few years has been a significant downfall for DumbFail Gaymes (who I shall call here).\n\nDFG has recently decided to start ripping off customers for various reasons:\n\nToo many variants of 1 loco - they've decided to release 5, yes 5 variants of the Class 66. I mean, who needs 5 SEPERATE variants of the Class 66, when you can shove the whole loot in a bundle instead, charge it £15 for 5 liveries, I'm happy.\n\nUnscenerized parts of routes - it seems that recently, DFG have decided to limit the scenario possibilities by releasing routes with limited/no scenery on sections of it. Take a look at the ECML-S route for example, they included the Hertford Loop track and signaling, but no scenery? This is absurd! Goodness knows how many more scenarios we could've seen in the Workshop. But no, they decide all they want is the £££. This is exactly what they did with the Sheerness Branch for London-Faversham, leave out the scenery, then added the scenery items over several updates, then charge £12 JUST TO ADD THE SCENERY IN. Oh, and added a Class 466 in.\n\nLack of effort - this is a big notice in recent releases. Their favourite motto in house is "Let's rip off the customers, recycle everything!". This has been very evident in some releases. For example, look at the Class 365 passenger view. I think many people were thinking they were going to use a whole new view, or re-use the Class 465 passenger view and reskin it a bit. But oh no, they didn't. They decided to recycle the Class 166 passenger view, which is how old? FROM RAIL SIMULATOR DAYS OH GOD. The quality of that pass view is awful, it's like they've stuck several pieces of cardboard together and added some adverts. It's even noticeable that it's from the Great Western Link 166, as the logo is on one of the ads in the passenger view.\nAnother good use of recycling is the Class 321 sounds. Now, what were DFG THINKING OF?! They decided to use the 455 sounds, which is ok I suppose, but just cover your ears when it comes to the doors. Oh dear, what a disaster. They decided, to use an 1938 UNDERGROUND train, for the door sounds. I'm sorry, but the 321 didn't exist in 1938, so why use sounds from a 1938 train then?!\n\nTerrible customer support - I've read various posts on forums complaining about DFG's support. It seems that their staff know absolutely little of the base game whatsoever. Now for some issues, clearing the blueprint cache, or verifying the game cache won't 100% fix your problem. It could be a core issue, of which DFG need to fix. And that is exactly what I'm going to go into next, bugs and issues.\n\nBugs and issues - It seems that every year when a new core update is released, more and more bugs creep out of nowhere. It seems that DFG's attitude falls to the community to fix these bugs. There are some bugs which have been in the game for years, which STILL hasn't been fixed. An example of this is the WCML-N buffers. There are some at Glasgow Central and various other places on the route. This is affecting scenario creation. Imagine you are arriving at Carlisle, then the game stops with an error saying a train has crashed into one of those buffers? Wouldn't you go ballistic? I'm sure you would. And unfortunately DFG are too lazy just to issue a simple fix for this.\n\nPricing - In mine and others' opinions, most of the DLCs are waaaaaaaaaay too overpriced. Now think of us today, we all have jobs and families, however all of our money goes for the bills, mortgage, food, essential stuff for us to live. And yet they want to nick £25 from our bank for a route and maybe 1 piece of rolling stock.\n\nScenarios and AI - Let me just say 1 thing, the AI dispatcher is awful. If you think scenario creation with AI on a busy route was easy, you can think again. It's way too buggy, it will route your train to the wrong place/direction, and it will just fail your scenario. However, the freeware community have done a great job on scenario creation, including those on the Workshop. If you had problems with the AI dispatcher and have fixed it, I hail you.\n\nSo in theory, a great game, some good DLCs, just a rubbish company, DumbFail Gaymes to deal with.\n\nRant over.\n[/rant]","January 17, 2014","false","517.4"," 318 of 368 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","318","368","0","21"

The dispatcher, and routing/pathing AI is a real pain to handle as it is really blunt. That's why you can see a lot of scenarios without any or rare traffic, on routes where in reality there is heavy traffic. And in same time, the free and opensource Open Rails, does perfectly this job, as it routes and controls HUNDREDS of trains for a day in timetable mode, just like OpenTTD, even on single track lines with passing loops. see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRdvZZjQSk4\nI've just played a default scenario for Hamburg-Hannover route, where i didn't meet with ANY rail traffic, just static consists on yards. This looks weird, everything is empty, like in the zombie apocalypse movies, and makes the game really boring, as you don't need to stop/slow don't because of a traffic jam or another slower train, or a crossing, but every signal lights are green for you, and you only get yellow signal lights because of a diverted switch, not because of other traffic.\n\nI can't blame the developers of the game for making DLC-s as that makes them money, but the problem is they focusing only on DLCs, and not fixing the bugs, just searching for excuses.\nFor a good example for their support: I've sent them a report about a long time existing bug of the TrainDecal.fx shader in game (what is for the dynamic numbering of the locomotives), that makes the numbers look dark in non-TSX graphics mode (which is used by a lot of laptop, or low end PC users), and their answer was to use TSX mode, and they won't fix the bug.\nHowever i have PC for which the TSX mode isn't a problem, but not everyone can run TSX mode...\n\nI have so much play time in this game, because i having it since 2010, more than four years. BTW the most of the play hours are not play hours, but testing and debugging addons for the game. But since i don't see any future of this game, i ceased to develop addons to it, i only start it to test bug fixes of the existing rolling stock, since 2012, and to test how this game doesn't get improved with every new release, except of menu changes, and smaller graphical eye candy.","November 30, 2013","false","321.4"," 833 of 1,028 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","833","1","0","52"

Sure, the graphics look good when you turn everything up, but even if your computer was built by NASA you won't be able to, because it will kill your FPS.\n\nSo, turning the graphics down to acheive a reasonable FPS means that there are artifacts and graphical glitches... shadows that continuously "catch up" a few feet in front of your train for example.\n\nHowever, even when using minimal graphics setup, the game is FULL of bugs, glitches and other problems that make it extremely frustrating to use.\n\nBut it's worth pressing on because of the authentic "feel" of the trains, right? WRONG. The trains in this sim are trains that I have been on thousands of times, when commuting from Brighton to London, for example. This sim fails to model the sounds and operating methods of these trains.\n\nFor a game that is supposed to allow you to control trains, there is an astonishing amount of difficulty in setting up your controls. They have gone out of their way to make this game frustrating to use and difficult to control.\n\nAlso, forget about gameplay. This sim is strictly about driving your train, with many scenarios requiring you to perform tedious "shunting" tasks to assemble your train, a task made even more tedious by the games lack of user friendly options. The various scenarios are almost ALL BROKEN and have not been fixed by the publisher.\n\nThe publisher of this game charges a fortune for all the DLC, and it's broken, they don't fix things after it's released.\nInstead, they rely on the "community" to add more workshop content for the game, which is completely ridiculous, like something a child would think of.\n\nSo, I am not recommending this game, unless you are looking for false promises and an un- authentic train sim.\n\n","September 23, 2015","false","75.6"," 281 of 326 people (86%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","86","281","326","17","8"

Sure, a lot of work is probably put into the routes, but the exorbitant prices they charge border insanity. Especially since most of the stuff comes with bugs which makes the pricing even less acceptable. These bugs range from small annoyances to game-breaking trouble, as if it wasn't even playtested. You'll pay for graphical glitches, buggy sound, impossible missions and random derailments. All of these issues have been raised by many people over many years, time and again, but are never or extremely rarely resolved by the team. False promises concerning solutions are made over and over, and the official "support team" seems to consist of a single highly efficient paper shredder, as people rarely get replies.\n\nAbout the game itself; it is definitely not the most entertaining. You need to have a huge interest in trains otherwise you'd just be bored all the time. In all fairness, the devs are not entirely to blame here for once, cause driving a train is just that... You're on rails, you set the accelerator and you watch the scenery go by. Scenery that could have been modelled a lot better, too. It would have been more interesting if the controls weren't so painfully lacking in depth. But the game world also feels very dead, you just feel like you're driving on your own in a void world. If you expect bustling traffic and challenging rush hours, you'll be disappointed. The main activity in this game is... staring. It's painful to realise, but that is actually what you'll be doing most of the time you decide to have another go.\n\nThe exception to the boredom are steam trains which provide sufficient depth and challenge for more than the usual 30 consecutive minutes I can play this. Only you need to learn how to drive and fire them yourself cause the game does not provide much in the way of learning material. And to make matters worse, the HUD is not optimized (read: entirely unfriendly and frustrating) for steam trains. If you want the line graph to see the route and signals, you lose control over your engine, literally, because the buttons on the hud override the actual controls.\n\nI've had this game since it was called Railworks 3 and in all the years since, it has improved painfully little and the devs just keep churning out new expensive stuff of the same mediocre quality. They really should focus on improving what's already there, and listening to the community instead of muting all the critics. Fix all the bugs and improve the graphics and physics before moving on, that would be properly appreciated. The core game is lacking, if you're lucky you can get some DLC in a big sale without too much bugs that will entertain for a couple of hours at most. But even then chances are you will be wondering why the heck you are playing this rather than all the great actual games out there.\n\nThis product tries to appeal to casual gamers and simulation lovers, but it will fail to please either.","November 27, 2013","false","99.6"," 579 of 724 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","579","724","0","24"

Why are us fans still holding out hope they'll ever fix the game when they churn out new stuff without revisiting old stuff. What hope do we have when the only "upgrades" make it worse?\n\nAs of 11/5/14 (now 24/8/14) it's sad to see (still) nothing has come from their so-called "bug squashing team", other than more promises. The same bugs that spoil the game are still there. I wouldn't moan so much but when you spend so much on expensive DLC you'd expect them to sort out at least minor issues withough pretending they need months to test.....Please DTG show us you mean it and aren't just being dishonest. After all this time with very little I think we can safely say now those who said the bug team didn't exist were correct.\n\nAs a way to experience the sights and sounds of rail driving it's not bad and I have enjoyed it for almost 300 (now 700) hours but due to Dovetail Games particularly abysmal customer service and the fact they are reluctant to address faults that have been in the game for many years now I cannot recommend it.\n\nI've spent hundreds on it but realise that nearly everything they release appears to be relatively untested -  i've never known so many faults in a game. You only have to read other reviews to find this for yourself. Some of the oldest sets - which are still priced the same as new content - are still plagued with issues that make them unusable, such as the class 390. As a tilting train designed to corner faster than the average train it is absolutely impossible to complete the career scenarios due to "ride quality" being compromised unless you go so slow you then end up being behind schedule, this on DLC that has been around for an age. Also the night lights are non-existant so you can't see where you are heading at all in the dark. This is quite typical of most models that seem to miss the most basic real life functions of any train.\n\nRoutes are many but most also very flawed and in the average route each time you will be guaranteed to see something new that should have been found in testing but one assumes the testing is done by us and advice/complaints then ignored entirely, dare mention this though anywhere and they'll do what they can to have it removed.\n\nDon't waste a penny on it and if you must wait until the sales at xmas or easter, any other time you'd be stupid to pay full price...i'm stupid I and have payed for many routes at full price....wish I hadn't.\n\nThe only real entertainment from the game is from buying loads of DLC and relying purely on fans of the game to create decent scenarios as the ones in game are nearly all rubbish with very few train varieties that leave you with no sense of immersion at all.\n\nI should also point out that despite building my own PC for over £800 most of the routes run terribley (some would be over the moon with what I see as bad, it's 60fps half of the time and as low as 14 in places (e.g LLS in GEML) not including user created scenarios where it's to be expected at times) due to a badly optimised game engine, despite the fact I can run literally anything else at full settings, BF4, Crysis 3, Arma 3, not this though. It looks terrible at times on some routes (as do many of the older trains) but still can run badly. Some routes you can go underground in free roam and see why when most of the buildings you can see over-ground are about 4 times deeper into the ground which I'm guessing the CPU still has to deal with it as the GPU doesn't seem to be at all bothered by it (evga 670).  Some older routes aren't so bad but some look appalling in places. Newer routes are at least vaslty improved in comparison but nothing is priced accordingly.\n\nLook for 3rd party content for the best additions to your collection. Does seem a shame though that despite sometimes being a pretty game it often feels no better than many beta builds i've played over the last ten years, potentially great but without the effort by DTG it'll die off soon enough but the arrogance will blind them to the fact until it's too late.\n\nIf you doubt the content of any of this just use the search filter for reviews of this game and check for all time most helpful. You will have to search hard for popular positive feedback.\n\nIt pains me to write about it like this but we're all as fans being made mugs of :(","January 30, 2014","false","168.0"," 271 of 321 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","271","321","0","0"

It was fun to play at first but as time progressed I realised this is half-finished product.

On the other hand you get a game with a number of bugs - for some of them there are workarounds, for some not - you have to live with them somehow. Yes, there are DLCs, but they seem overpriced for the quality you get - even if the main line is finished, when you go to explore it you may find tracks only, without scenery etc (PDL is an example). Steam forum wont help you, not because the community, which is eager to give you all the remedies, but the RSC policy, namely RCS moderator, that deletes all the posts related to the issues people are encountering, giving only support email as an advice. Unfortunately support does not respond to your emails and there are no patches for problems, known for several months, event years.\nTo sum up - you have to decide.

The game itself is lackluster for it being 2014.   Forced upgrades each year breaking numerous DLC and introducing even more bugs that most likely will not get fixed.

But this needs to be said in my opinion.\n\nI played all versions of Railworks or as its now known Train Simulator 2015.\nWhen Railworks started out it was a revolutionary develepment in the way we preceive and play with train games.\n\nGraphics were out of this world good and realism was really captured well. It was all doable but extremely hard to get a perfect score on a scenario. I liked that a lot, I liked the realism in it, though be it with its own limitions, as most simulators do.\n\nIf I look back and compare over 6 years of develepment and multiple releases to our current release, I must conclude that I really regret spending 42 euros on steam to buy the Special Steam Edition of TS 2015.\n\nI find the game to become oversimplified, too mainstream and too commercial, moreover the absolute lazyness of dovetail and friends and the shear nerve to rip us people off by reselling their existing DLC content again, without any noticable changes. To say the least, I'm really disappointed.\nIf you wanna make a kids game or entry-level trains game, then by all means do so, just don't call it 'SIMULATOR'.\nFor the record to all that don't understand the definition of simulator, (especially at dovetail and friends) here it is:\n\nSimulate = recreate something or someone to the closest possible.\nOr in plain english get as real as it gets.... not oversimplifying controls and forcing hud screens on me to use....\nBottomline.... if you do not recreate or want to be as real as it gets, then by all means, don't call your game a simulator.\n\nThere are also numerous little quircks and bugs in the game that date back from their first release of Railworks 1.\nE.g. My keyboard partially fails to react or simply looses connection to the in-game controls, but at the same time I can change my cam views...very annoying when you know you have to brake for a speed reduction and you can't in time because your keys for braking are temporarily disconnected to the train controls.... whoopsie there goes your perfect score for your scenario.\n\nAnother example is clipping is still going on here and there, where you pass a tree that's kinda low-branched and close to the track, on occassion the branches will 'decapitate' you in your cabin, because they sway through your cabin as you pass the tree in question. ( ofcourse this is not really possible in-game....It just looks that way...LOL)\n\nAlso one point of critisism is "the feeling of speed" is way off. Still after all those years.\nIf I for example pass through a station in a ICE3 or similar HST @ over 160mph+, I still feel I pass through it at maybe half that speed. If I drive 100mph instead of 60mph, the world virtually still passes by at the same rate.... this is unacceptable in this day and age, Dovetail.\n\nLast but not least, their constant performance-lag in-game. I didn't always owned the right PC with specs adequate enough for Railworks in the past, I must admit. But these days I own a very respectable gaming-rig with more than adequate specs and I still, after all these years, experience stuttering and lagginess while playing, no matter if it is a new map or an old one...\n\nBut aside all the little quircks and bugs and the fact that neither the tracks or the trains, or even the overall world has been majorly overhauled and updated, (it basicly all looks and feels the same since Railworks 3 aka Train Simulator 2012), the fact that really angers me the most is the nerves of steel at the Dovetail consortium. Where they now have gone completely haywire on the DLC. Basicly what they did is change some little itsybitsy code and converted some important files to a different fileformat, which basicly renders all previously purchased DLC useless in this so-called new Railworks 6 aka Train Simulator 2015. Then they have the nerve to resell their DLC untouched and unchanged back to the public in their new fileformat so it can be read by the game.\n\nYou can check this fact by checking your Routes folder of your game in the SteamLibrary/SteamApps/common/Railworks/Content/Routes folder.\nIf you would take a look at your folders in there it will useally look like: 00000029-0000-0000-0000-000000002014\nThis folderstructure goes for most of your routes in Railworks. The last four digits in this example is 2014.\nThis is the buildyear or release year of the original content. But this time it contains the same files with the new modifications in it. If you would compare these files with the original DLC from last year, you will find they are the same files but some now have a different fileformat at the end...\n\nLike many other reviews I read here on Steam regarding this game, conclude in a similar manner.\nUnfortunately I cannot conclude otherwise.\n\nIn my honest opinion, I feel they are proving they are not only lazy, but also very devious for trying to sell people what they already own. Therefore I must conclude this as the worst release yet of Railworks and cannot recommend this game positively to others.\nI hope this was informative or helpfull in anyway to at least one person, so I can be happy with this review.\n\nI could go on and on about a lot of things that are still not up to par yet, after all these years.\nBut I'm not the kind that just wants to complain about everything. I always was a big fan of this Series and curious where they would end up later.... but seeing now what they did and where they are after all this time, is for me at least very dissappointing.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nEradicationGod","October 9, 2014","false","60.5"," 151 of 195 people (77%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","77","151","195","10","2"

It has a few things going good for it, and most of them are the fact that it has trains.

Optimization is HORRID, though some of the trains and the scenes are really pretty.  Also, the DLC is a ripoff.  $40 for a route, and a couple locos/stock would be almost worth it if it came with more than 3-4 scenarios.

I find it hard to believe that there really is that much worth of content in all the DLCs put together.\n\nThe developers don't seem to want to add any Australian train routes, despite the Aussie routes being some of the most beautiful in the world. There also seems to be a lack of African and Asian rail lines. Instead, they're obsessed with European routes instead, and the odd US route.\n\nThe only good point about this game is that it always seems to get upgraded to the latest version at the end of each year, free of charge; Train Simulator 2014 got upgraded to Train Simulator 2015 free of charge, which in turn got upgraded to Train Simulator 2016 free of charge. However, in my mind that simply demonstrates how little changes between each version, and how much the developer is trying to milk customers with DLC.\n\nMy recommendations to the developers:\nCombine DLCs into packs and drastically drop their prices. Perhaps have a UK pack, a US pack, and a Europe pack, each for a reasonable price.\nLook at improving the efficiency of your code, with the aim to improve the frame rate.\nAdd routes outside of Europe and the US, including areas such as Asia, Africa, and Oceania.\nConsider adding multiplayer capability, allowing two or three other trains on the same line and the use of spurs and sidings (loops and stubs).","September 23, 2015","false","2.4"," 95 of 118 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","95","118","5","11"

It's out of date. It's expensive (apart from in the sales), and DTG spend more time creating more and more DLC, rather than sorting out the abomination that the base game has become.\n\nDTG claim that next year the game will be using the Unreal engine.

Fog is still bland, you can't set fog distance at all neither any other options for rain or even worse conditions like icing on track or so. The developers attitude still remains the same, utterly disgraceful and they still think this is a family game, because it is not. This game have to get past the "game for kids" attitude by the developers, and they have to keep focusing on making the simulation aspect a lot better, e.g.: they could implement manual startup functions for trains, better sanding, more control functions like the ETCS, radio communication, train station announcements, and there could be a lot more that is actually not in this particual game, and certainly someone who is not a hardcore train fan will find this game extremely boring.\n\nThe game have so much potential with Quick Drive but players requests are still not being met with equal amount of support to implement better usability for that particularly interesting game mode. I have to note that the lack of custom, fictional maps, there is literally non, other then what Kuju did back in a while but that is freely available on the Steam Workshop. Ah yes, the workshop is integrated horribly badly, you won't ever find what you want to find to be honest it is just a failed method of implementation for this game.\n\nSome DLCs for this game is amazing, but the prices do seem a bit overly extortionate especially on tracks and trains that are way out of date and are only updated so that they can roll on the track, e.g.: Metronom, Düsseldorf-Köln, Münich-Augsburg, Ruhr-Sieg line, these are really in bad condition.\n\nBut yeah, try convince the developers that they are at the wrong when when we are actually experiencing all the bad, they could easily upgrade the Ruhr-Sieg line and make it all cool and dandy like they did with the last two german maps.\n\nI must say I'm highly dissatisfied with the company's policies, they are too intrusive, obtrusive and they will ban all their political foes whom speak out against them in what ever manner.\nStill is today.[2015.02.20]\n\nI can only rate this game 3 out of 10. [Only buy when 75% or more discounted!]\n\nEdit 2015.07.08: So, according to the news DTG is going to release TS2016 as a brand new game separate from the current 2015 platform, and by that they won't be continuing the current platform upgrade for this game and we don't receive the update. This is actually one hell of a bad idea, but on their part it is very genius, because... If they create a new game, and leave this one here, they can basically delete and eliminate content that doesn't function properly, they can apply fixes to maps and other content that they will re-brand and fix, but next to that they gonna be able to start clean with the rating system on this game by having a clean slate of reviews from users.\n\nWell, all I can say right now to DTG is good luck, if they managed to implement in a lot of game experience enhacing effects like more dynamic traffic, alterable path and priority system, then I guess the game could become a massive hit, well I as a game designer I do think that could be great addition to the game and could improve the relation between the company and the userbase.\n\nBut, if this is gonna be another let down by the company, then their effort to try to start with a clean slate will completely backfire and will get a lot of problems in the end, let's hope for the best, since there are possibilities for it.\n\n\nOkay, so 2016 update.\nApparently, it become a pay-ware upgrade! What a shame, how far did we have to sunk, bugged DLCs and still such a broken and utterly unoptimized game, I just can't beleive what the developers are doing to this franchise. God forbid them from ruining Flight Simulator X, I hope Microsoft will revoke their license if that happens.","October 2, 2014","false","466.7"," 126 of 167 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","126","167","4","63"

It's a promising title isn't it if you love trains and want to be a train driver but otherwise can't, but behind this title, there is a game that although great for it's time, looks so cartoony and sterile with no sense of real-world immersion, and it is more of a game than a simulator, but what realistically what much else can you do with a train simualtor? This isn't FSX, you apply throttle and brake, but there's no real challenge to the game. Train driving is a very responsible job with roles more than just driving a train, but you don't get more than that in this simulator. Some random train faults or signal failures or something would be nice. Or even follow World of Subways with a character to walk about.\n\nPassenger AI in this game is a disaster. They have the IQ of a teaspoon when they walk off the platform onto the tracks whilst somehow defying the laws of gravity in the process, and showing no care that a speeding train (or slowing one) is heading for them. Though let's face it, you wouldn't care if the train was just gonna go through you and not leave you with even a scratch. I mean it would be grim to include it, and this isn't Grand Theft Auto, so we can let the lack of an effect slide. It wouldn't be good advertising to show the windscreen wipers smearing blood on the front train window would it?\n\nThe trains themselves are for the most part nice, and the newer more interactive ones with realistic features such as lights on the front not affecting the lights on the back (you could drive with headlights on at both ends if you so wish, unless I am very wrong). But the sounds are also a disaster, I mean gaining access to depots is very difficult, and if we spent long enough waiting for access, DTG would lose customers cause of the demand for new DLC. Let's just say either waiting ages or forever for a train, or one with atrocious sounds. Whichever suits you best.\n\nRoutes are the best things in this game without a doubt, because despite the complex tools that most people aren't even bothered to make an attempt to get use to or understand, the outcome is very nice if done properly. In terms of detail and accuracy, routes are the strong point, because the quality assurance is vital in order to make profit. Some routes dominate others, but nowadays they're just getting too small or have too little trains. Germans have it worse, I mean why build something like Munich Augsburg at about 60km when you can build up to about 200km of railway? Time and money of course, but if there is any investors pumping money into DTG to do stuff like this, then by golly they are not paying them enough.\n\nThere is a route builder and scenario creator in this game, and this is probably the only time you will get something truly different. Unfortunately, most people decide "this is too complex" after spending five minutes trying to figure out how you make a train station or even put a train on the track. The tools are complex, but when you get use to them and become aware of them, then it's a nice little thing to do. Whoever thinks it needs to be simplified, try chatting to Network Rail telling them how hard you find it setting out cetenary wires which are created automatically in game without the need to get smelted iron for the overhead wires, and all the engineering plans and precision. Thought not, let's proceed.\n\nPrice of DLC is, like most people think, overpriced. Now everyone blames DTG for this, but I think it's Steam who set the price, and I do think this is unfair to pin the blame on DTG. I mean if a tube of Pringles is cheaper in Asda (or Walmart if you're an American reader) than it is in Tesco, clearly the crisp makers themselves aren't setting the prices, cause the one's selling need some cash as well. Unfortunately, unless you're well off and willing to spend a lot of money (which I have, but I'm quite the tight-wad) then you'll have to wait for Steam sales, cause otherwise you might need to have a word with your bank manager for spending over £2000 on Train Simulator DLC.\n\nSo overall, it's an alright game, but I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe I would've recommended it when it first came out, or even a few years after, but we're nearly in 2016, and with the UE4 version coming very soon, all the energy should really be put into that, kind of taking into account some of my points such as a playable character, less cartoony and more organic (something like dirt and grime and that, I mean this is UE4), more advanced trains with realistic interactivity, longer routes, and maybe more to do than just drive trains. I mean that should be the primary thing, but if every journey is the same, which for a real train driver it isn't cause anything can happen, then you're gonna get bored REAL FAST if you, like me, have no life and have spent around 1000 hours on the game in total already.\n\nFinal score... 5.5/10 (good, but really needs improvement).","September 19, 2015","false","129.2"," 78 of 95 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","78","95","5","2"

However:\n\nThe Developers are perfectly capable of developing stunning and immersive add-ons with the right trains like The Woodhead Line add-on but:\n- They have a habit of not fixing bugs and issues with their DLCs.  When they fix them, it is often a very poor fix.\ne.g. 1. The Class 455 comes with unique "shadow-casting headlights" which is a massive fps killer.  Not fixed.\ne.g. 2. The Class 166 "fix" is a half-hearted one.  It used to take off like a rocket so they quadrupled the power lag to "solve" it.\ne.g. 3  The Class 450, which has been "fixed" twice but braking is still not sorted.\n\n- Obnoxiously priced DLC trains containing just one paint scheme.  They then sell a second paint scheme of the same train at full price.\n- Duplicate DLCs of the "same" train, adding massive complexity for 3rd-party scenario developers as these duplicates are not compatible with each other.\n- A good number of default scenarios are rushed, devoid of AI traffic and have niggling bugs.\ne.g. AI trains collide with each other due to bad routing, Scenario-specific speed restrictions not marked etc.\n- The TS2014 community can be vile at times, with a proliferation of negative comments aimed at the developer.\n\nI've been playing this since June 2011 in the Railworks 2 days when the developers were slightly more humble, and the cost of DLCs less prohibitive.  I still love trains and play this for enjoyment and to get the most out of my sunk costs.\n\nHowever, I recommend new users to stay well away from this sim/game due to its massive cost, bugs and poor developer support.  Due to my previous intoxication with this game, I probably handed over far too much cash and it took an unrelated truck simulator for me to realise how mediocre TS2014 and its support really is.","December 9, 2013","false","756.1"," 80 of 100 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","80","100","0","0"

This manages to pump out more useless DLC than PAYDAY 2 does.

Before that they were about as detailed as any passengers you'd see in Trainz 2004 or in any low-poly interior (which there is a lot).\n- A lot of the tools are confusing to figure out at first, and a lot of tutorials offer little help, as the game changes around every September. Sounds a lot like a good amount of games today. Isn't that right Ubisoft, EA, and whatever COD is?\n- With each game, the system requirements change. I get this is common in technology, but a lot of us don't change like everyone else does.\n- I've been interested in this game since Rail Simulator, and as of this release, I'm starting to want to revert back to Trainz. Or even venture into Run-8. (Protip: Don't buy Run-8.)\n\nIn short, if you want to get the game, get it. I'd prefer you get it on a /deeply/ cheap sale, however.\n\nI'll probably get comments of autists spewing their views, and you're more than welcome to.\nLike my videos and screenshots I post of this game, I'm not responding to it unless it deserves being responded to.\n\nCheers,\n- Fancypants","November 30, 2014","false","382.8"," 81 of 104 people (78%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","78","81","104","11","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FelixTrain/recommended/24010/","FelixTrain","FelixTrain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FelixTrain/","13 products in account","Train Simulator 2016. Beat The Extreme. It's not extreme. At all.\n\nThe game play is driving a train from A to B, as the title suggests. There are lots of different trains and routes but the thing you do is to drive from A to B.\n\nThe base game.\nPretty cheap for what it offers. The 3 routes and trains are all pretty good. While the UK route is a re-hash of a previous route, made in 2014, it is a decent package.\n\nHowever, in order to get a full experience of the game, you will need to buy some of the mountains of Train Simulator DLC.\nThat in itself is a bore.\nThe next thing you find is that the base game and a few of the collections are actually value for money, the rest is daylight robbery. For the British stuff (which I'm focusing on, I'm not that clued-up on the other countries), all the sounds are terrible except the Class 395. If you've never heard a train before, the sounds are great but otherwise you should go to Armstrong Powerhouse and buy the Sound Packs. Well worth the fiver.\nThere are also many annoing bugs. There are the trivial ones which involve cars going through trains at some level crossings and some bridges blocking the track which you just drive through but there are the ones which are annoying.\nThe game is very unstable on many very good systems meaning crashes happen quite frequently. Sometimes trains will derail even when you are well within the speed limit or just stopped; the game will come up with the error "Game over due to consist tilt" and you will be chucked back to the menu.\n\nOnce you actually get into this simulator, you will realise that Dovetail Games treat the players not like customers but like walking wallets which they can dip their hands into whenever they have not made enough profit.\n\nYou will also notice once you get into the franchise a bit more that everything is re-used. A lot of the British rolling stock have the default 455 sounds, which are poor anyway. The re-using of appauling sounds is normal, and something you will have to get used to, I'm afraid. Then there's the routes. They are usually decent, if a bit short, but tend to come with trains that are already in the game. The Midland Main Line is an example of this because it comes with the 66 and 319, both already in the game. Trains that could have been included that are not in the game are the 222 and 387. This is repeated with the Munich to Rosenhiem (101 and 423) and various other add-ons. While I can see this happening if only 2 trains run on the routes, many of them have multiple trains on them, which instead of filling some very large gaps in the game, DTG recycle. And recycle. And recycle. This means various people have to fill the gap.\n\nAt some point, this game is going to crash because people are going to get fed-up with what DTG are doing. It has been getting worse recently and there are no signs that this is going to improve any time soon. Before you used to get a free upgrade to the next Train Simulator (even though it is just a patch with a new title) but TS2016 was sold as an entirely new game because it had "so many new features" that it warrants everyone paying for a game they already have! Well, it didn't. It had a small extra funciton that helped (like a patch) and a mode that is completly redundant as it's unofficially been in the game for a long time now. So it did not. You will get used to this constant overhyping and mis-selling of content if you get into this game. So don't.\n\nThe developers keep saying "We are aware of our standard and are trying to improve it" and "we do care [about what you want]". To pick up on the first point, we are yet to see any evidence of this. And to pick up on that last point, the things that we have been asking for for a long time such as a Eurostar route and better default sounds have not happened. Even when they do, it is usually not 100% of what was requested. For example, the Midland Main Line route for train sim only goes from St Pancras to Bedford although originally Elephant and Castle to Bedford was requested. And to pick up on the first point: nice try but nothing has happened yet. Additionally, once a route is finished, there is no chance it will be updated. Gravesend, Finsbury Park, Peterborough, London Bridge and many other stations are in old models which, as a community, we know will never be fixed by DTG. Instead we wait for people to do this stuff for free while DTG sit back and rake the cash in. A combination of "can't be bothered" and "we need to make loads of money" attitudes mean this game is on a downward curve. If nothing is done, it will crash. Hard.\n\nIt must be said that new members of the game get good value for money when joining. But this changes the moment you dip your toe into the game. DTG will exploit your desire to have your favorite train or route in the game and so you will pay the full price for it (£12 per train, £25 per route with some exceptions). This in nearly all cases is not value for money at all. It must be said that if you know a train very well, you will realise that DTG make good trains rarely. As far as I know, only 1 actually good train exists, that being the class 395, which comes with the very linear London to Faversham High Speed route.\n\nSo if you want a very realistic train simulator that gets everything right, this is the only one around. Although it doesn't get nearly everything right, as outlined above. But be prepared to spend thousands of pounds. And I mean thousands. There's more than £3,000 worth of DLC for you to waste your money on.\n\nForm your own opinion.\n\nFelix.","July 14, 2015","false","211.0"," 58 of 69 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","58","69","3","4"

The sounds are 'meh' for a lot of the Content, but they have improved slightly on occassion.\n\nIt is definitely not a Game for everyone, and mostly appeals to Train Fanatics, or Sim Fanatics [like myself]. The hours can be endless depending on said person.\n\nAs the Steam Store has a lot of DLC created by 3rd Party Developers, I am excluding them completely out of this Review. The DLC created by DoveTail Games can have a YoYo effect when it comes to Quality on their DLC. For an example:\n\n- Loco 'A' released in November will have Great Modelling, nice and Crisp Textures, and a wide variety of Features.\n- Loco 'B' released in December will have Blocky Modelling, Blurry Textures, and a lack of Features.\n\nI'm sure this is due to a different Team working on different Content, but there should be Standards to live up to, especially when they are sold at the same Price.\n\nAlthough it is called a "Simulator", it leans more towards a Game. The Features it offers are very Basic, and most of the Switches and Monitors are just there for show [there are some exceptions though].\n\nSo if you are looking for a indepth, and highly Realistic experience, then keep looking, or alternatively learn to play without the HUD, and ask about External 3rd Party Content which produce Realistic Loco's [though the Variety is low].\n\nDespite how enjoyable it can be, the Game has many issues. I'm only going to name a few, because I'm not into "Bashing" a Game I enjoy [that's what Forums are for]. Such as Features not working Correctly [or at all], Scenario's which cannot be completed due to AI crashing, Dump File errors, and Signals not Functioning correctly.\n\nI would say if you want to invest in this Game, then it is essential to do Research before any purchases, and do a lot of Reading on the Forums, and never be afraid to ask any Questions there, even ones you might think are silly.\n\nGenre\n- Simulator\n\nGame Elements\n- Commuter Train Operator\n- Freight Train Operator\n- Shunter Train Operator\n- Train Spotter\n\nAverage Playthrough\n- Unlimited\n\nLiked\n- Supports TrackIR\n- Wide Variety of Content\n- Good Visuals for an Old Engine\n- Good Models and Textures\n- Some interesting Features\n- Helpful Community\n\nDisliked\n- Broken Content\n- Lack of Bug Fixing\n- Moderate Sounds\n- Lack of Advanced Features\n- Quality YoYo's too much","November 13, 2015","true","812.6"," 123 of 171 people (72%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","72","123","171","17","3"

The game hasn't really changed since 2012. Different DLC are included in different years but you need to purchase the game every year to receive them. So it updates for free to the latest year but you don't receive any DLC that comes with that year unless you pay again. The biggest gripe with this game is DLC content is priced at an extremely high and unreasonable level. You could easily pay £3000 to buy all DLC. Dovetail say that you only buy what you like, but routes cost around £24 and trains £12. Considering the level of detail and there inaccuracy’s this pricing is just beyond a joke.\n\nAs a simulator of driving trains in the UK it is really terrible. As a train driver who has driven trains and routes that appear in the game I have to say it is very unrealistic. It certainly isn’t a simulator. Almost all the trains have massive aspects of there function, and operation missing. The operation of AWS and TPWS which are integral parts of driving trains are either missing or integrated incorrectly. AWS magnets at signals often don't even register. Most of the buttons in the cab don't work. The starting of engines and even down to the basics of simply pulling away is completely wrong. If you think you are driving a train when you play this then you are mistaken. Obviously it has to be basic so it can be played by people of varying degrees of knowledge but there isn’t even an option to play a realistic mode.\n\nThe routes are never updated; the signals are mostly in the wrong place and act in un-characteristic ways. Platforms lengths, scenery, junctions are generally works of fiction. The performance characteristics of the trains are also inaccurate. It’s impossible to drive the train in a safe manner and keep to the timetable.\n\nGames like this only exist because people pay good money for rubbish. This game could be so much better and bigger and make even more money if its production company put a little effect in and weren’t so greedy.  There is a massive gap in the market for a realistic train simulator, probably community developed, when that happens the train simulator franchise will be dead.\n","September 19, 2015","false","53.3"," 50 of 60 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","50","60","0","0"

Here's a few suggestions:\n1) When you create a new version of a simulator, don't just change one texture and actually REMOVE features that people loved.\n2) Release bundles of trains for what you're currently charging a single train for. I know, this isn't a good business model, but having your game be known as DLC Simulator and having only a 66% (at time of writing) positive review rating really isn't a good one either.\n3) Maybe a good idea would be to just add some of these DLC trains into the base game. For example, instead of charging $45 for a game, then telling your customers to buy MORE TRAINS NOOOOOWWW... you could have an unlock-the-more-you-play system, and bring your company out of EA-like depths.\n\nThank you for your time, and I sincerely hope you will make TS2017 not a huge pile of nothing like this one was.\nSincerely,\nNick\n\n\nEDIT: I'm not sure about this, but I think that Dovetail also counts every train as DLC. So what this means is that you can't refund it.\nVery sneaky way to prevent a loss of money, Electronic Ar-I mean Rocksta-I mean Dovetail.\n\nANOTHER EDIT: No, I haven't played the 2016 edition. I don't need to. It's the same game as last year but with less features. So I think my review would be actually further in the state of development, because they're removing features.

At least, if this is your thing. This is not a fast-paced shooter. It's a game simulating trains. Obviously.\n\nHowever, despite me liking this game, there are some serious reasons why I would NOT recommend it.\n\nFirst of all, the basic game is already quite expensive. You can have some fun with what comes with it by default. But a little more would never hurt. When you're done with the vanilla content, and turn to DLC's, things get really expensive, really fast.\nThe amount of DLC available is huge, and I applaud that. But the prices for these packs are not just high, they are exhuberant. In my opinion, the prices are at least three times what they should be at most.\n\nA very, very big downside that shows itself in this DLC library, is that much of this DLC was made for older versions and weaker PC's, and has never been brought up to modern standards. But it's still sold at the same very high prices.\nSo you end up with a large library, but of very varying quality, especially in the visual department.\nAnother downside is that it's hard to tell how realistic or how deeply simulated a given locomotive is. Some require quite a bit of study, others are hardly more than visual skins over a very simple simulation. Again, hard to tell the difference beforehand.\nAnd another problem I have encountered, is that even old, well known problems never get patched.\n\nSo, my advice?\nIf you like trains, and there's a sale going that will get you this game at -75% or so, by all means go for it. I did.\nBut at full price? I'd stay away if I were you.

In fact nothing much has changed to this ‘simulator’ since the very first incarnation of it back in 2007. So what has it got to offer? For a start the graphics are brilliant, so you really can enjoy the scenery as you drive through it. Another plus would be the world editor, allowing users to create new routes and upload them to the steam workshop for free. That’s just as well because once you have got through the small amount of content that come with it the official DLC’s are extremely expensive and usually of low quality. Unfortunately there are major problems with this simulator; the train physics are unrealistic, AI trains powered by rockets (or so it seems), a very limited range of on train systems are simulated, with some trains not even having such simple things as DRA! The list goes on. I would urge anyone looking to purchase this simulator/game to think again, many other options are available.","December 4, 2013","false","495.3"," 56 of 72 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","56","72","0","5"

I really did but:.....\n1.  All that really matters in this game is the speed indicator.  In order to do some of the missions you have to go a little bit faster than the speed limit (i.e. going 35.5 instead of just 35) in order to make it on time.  Problem is... if you go 36 you get penalized. With trains that have a lot of cars, the speed get very irregular. You may go 3 mph under the speed limit and all of a sudden in a matter of milliseconds be going 3 mph over the speed limit which results in penalties. Since the only thing that matters in this game is the speed limit indicator, it is such a shame that the people who developed... say the scenery wasted their time cuz you can't enjoy the scenery with your eyes literally GLUED to the speed limit indicator.\n\n2. I love steam trains... and they are still bugged from the 2013 version.\n\n3. Saving your game is detrimental. I don't know if the developers didn't save the states of the junctions, but I have noticed that when I reload a saved game, the game bugs out and I can't get onto the correct track or other trains end up running into me, or light won't change because I am not where I am suppose to be.  They have a save game option for each scenerio, but it is a gamble if you use it.\n\n4. Expensive expansion packs. With as buggy as the game is, why would I want to pay more for expansions when the base game is buggy?\n\nIt does have its good points, but the more I played this game, the more I realized that the suck sucks way more than the good points. Beautiful as this game is, I can't recommend this game to someone when everytime I install and try to play this game, I am reminded why I uninstalled it in the first place!","January 2, 2015","false","151.6"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","40","47","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/koplopermau/recommended/24010/","koplopermau","Koplopermau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/koplopermau/","33 products in account","Train Simulator. I don't really know where to start on the game. I have owned it since Rail Simulator back in the days and when it realeased, it was a good game! However, over the years, the game has been upgraded and features have been added. The development of the game has been taken over by DTG that released it as Train Simulator 2012 and offered free updates over the years. And that is where the problem arises. The game was upgraded with new features that clogged the main engine.\n\nYou might think, "Hey, new features, that's nice!" but think again. Most features means more use of resources which, in this game, are pretty scarse. Since the engine is still from Rail Simulator, it is 32-bit, pretty inefficient and it means when you get over 3,4GB of memory (and trust me, you can hit that limit pretty easy!) it runs out of memory and the game crashes in a tempdump, if it hasn't crashed already in a random crash, which happens quite often.\n\nHaving that said, the game looks nice. Most train models are good quality and are well worth driving. The BR155, the recently released TGV Duplex on the LGV from Marseille to Avignon, the Class 395 Javelin are all great trains that are worth a drive. With real and correctly working TVM and PZB / SIFA implementations that'll make you scratch your head every now and then why the train throws itself into emergency again.\n\nBut what is a train without a railway? The game luckily includes routes where the trains you buy fit on perfectly. Most of the times. Köln - Koblenz, Sherman Hill (re-release!), Rivera Line in the 60s, and the Norfolk Coal District. The Köln - Koblenz route was released around 1,5 years before the release of Train Simulator 2016, Sherman Hill was included in one of the very first installments of Railworks, Rivera Line in the 60s is a re-release in an older era of an existing route and the Norfolk Coal District... *sigh*\n\nThe routes included with Train Simulator 2016 were among the most laziest I've ever seen. The developers didn't include any new routes, just one new locomotive (the BR155) with the Koblenz route, the Gas Turbine locomotive with Sherman Hill, some steam engines with the Rivera route and the Norfolk Coal District included some existing locomotives. Also, if you had Train Simulator 2016 and you wanted the new HUD (which was also updated from Train Sim 2015 to Train Sim 2016) you had to BUY THE GAME AGAIN FOR €29,99 (now 22,99). Basically for a worsened HUD and two locomotives from which one is actually really nice.\n\nHaving that said, most of the add-ons in this game are not included in the base game. You'll get three or four routes. Depending on which version you buy (German First Class, US First Class, UK First Class, Steam Edition, Epic Journeys). That's it, the rest of the add-ons you'll have to buy. And boy, the prices of these add-ons are ridiculous. Let me take the LGV: Marseille - Avignon as example. You'll get a 100km long route and ONE SINGLE train, the TGV Duplex. All of that for... Just €29,99! Wait, what?! This single route costs more than the base game which included four routes?! And you get only one train?! Yes. DTG is asking ridiculous prices for their add-ons. This LGV route alone costs more than the entire base game conbined. The recently released Maglev route basically lets you press a button before the train drives itself to its destination where the scenario ends. All of that for just 22,99!\n\nAlso, DTG does not support other countries than their base three. These are Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Do you live in The Netherlands (like me), Belgium, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Japan, India, or any other outside these three, do not expect DTG to make DLC from your country. The French DLC they released was the first (and probably the last) in THE ENTIRE LIFESPAN THAT Train Simulator EXISTS (wait, Semmeringenbahn from Austria was also released. If you don't count that they reused only German assets from previous routes except SOME assets and included only a repaint of an already existant locomotive. Heck, the passenger coaches didn't even include a luggage and first class car). They simply deny that other countires have rail enthousiasts, I think, while they could expand their userbase explosively by adding more and different countries to their collection.\n\nAfter complaing about the content of the game, let's move on to the working of the game. The trains you drive are pretty good, as mentionned earlier. They work, they drive, they have accurate safety systems. They drive on routes that look pretty nice, but lag at busy places. Mannheim, Munich, London. All these cities lag like crazy. Its not some 'busy area' lag where the framerate drops to 30 instead of 60, but true lag. 5-15fps depending on your system and on what quality you have set the game to. The standard scenario's that come with the games trains or routes usually lack any AI-traffic (trains you meet on the other track or during your journey). Especially the LGV lacked any AI traffic whilst its one of the busiest LGV's in France. If gives you a feeling you're... Alone. It gives the route a feeling of... Emptiness. If you meet or encounter one or two other trains during your drive you are quite lucky. Happily most routes have integration with Steam Workshop, where users can upload their own scenario's. With dozens of proper scenario's you can find some nice scenario's there. But wait, most users use more trains than included in the route you're trying to drive. Yeah, you'll need to buy those first before the scenario works properly, if it doesn't crash because of the memory limit. But Munich station completely empty looks nice, at least.\n\nCreating your own scenario's is quite hard. You need to get used to it first. The AI trains have the mental capability of a teaspoon (©FringeStalin) and usually the dispatcher that checks every order after you insert it and calculates everything between the orders fails if you work either longer than 20 minutes or insert more than 3 AI trains. This makes the scenario fail itself alltogether making you angry and the scenario unplayable. But hey, if you restart the game entirely everything is magically fixed! Only thing you have to wait for are the loading times, which if you are not on a SSD, are amazingly slow.\n\nDon't even bother building your own routes. The number of workarounds and things that are NOT documented by DTG is so high that making a route yourself is close to impossible if you don't put enough time in it.\n\nThere is some nice 3rd party material available for free. Altenburg - Wildau from SAD is one of the best available and I highly reccomend you getting this one straight from the start.\n\nOverall I give this game a 4,5 out of 10. There's much more I'd like to tell, but my tip: Only get this game in Steam Sale for 75% or more and make sure to thouroughly check if any add on you want to buy is in a package that's on discount.","May 18","false","809.4"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","38","44","4","1"

In spite of being a simply more advanced update of an older game, many graphical shortcuts have been used, which affect the gameplay, pedestrians that board and leave the train are very undetailed, move stiffly and aren't interesting, even though the game lets you view them up close.

I have read reviews, and watched youtube videos. I read all of the complaints and the to-do about the expensive DLC. It made me not want to try this game because of all the negative reviews.\n\nThe recent Steam sale gave me the opportunity to get into the game cheaply. Figured if it sucks, I lost the price of a pizza. Having played the game now let me add my 2 cents from the prospective of someone completely new to Train Simulator games. About the DLC pricing: I'll compare it to one of the most successful game franchise.. The Sims. Nobody complains about the Sims add on content, or Flight Sim X add on content or any other game that pops you for $20 bucks for an "expansion". I mean if you bought the Sims 3 game today at full retail price with all the expansions you are looking at $600. But by comparison look at how many "stuff" and "expansions" packs are available for this game compared to the Sims game... So of course it is going to cost more to get all the content.\n\nAs far as the old graphics and bugs, I see it as DTG doing their best to keep the 6 year old content users have bought still compatible and therefore usable in the new version of the game. I think they should have split the games into each year and set out compatible DLC for each edition. You want the next generation graphics... gotta by the new game. (See EA's Sims, Sims 2, Sims 3, Sims 4 model) Nobody is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that their Living Large expansion pack for Sims 1 doesn't work on the Sims 4 game today. Yet Dovetail has tried to give their customers equity in the DLC they buy. They have tried to update the game without completely changing the game engine so that previous content can still work. Imagine how crappy Sims 4 would be if EA was still making it compatible with Sims 1 stuff.\n\nThat being said, I caught the Steam sale and pulled the trigger on buying the game to try it. I have to say, it is not going to be for everyone. There is nothing shooting at you. There is nothing for you to shoot. You don't race anything... Except maybe the clock on a time schedule. It's a Train simulator... You drive trains. That's it. Its not the most exciting thing in the world. But then again neither is Flight Simulator in between take offs and landings. And even ETS2 and ATS can get boring in the long haul between pickup and delivery points.\n\nBut the game does have a certain quality for those who like simulator games. Driving a big train in and out of yards is great fun. Operating a heavy coal train in the driving snow down a slippery slope is challenging. The workshop community has tons of free scenarios for you to run with your purchased DLC, giving this game an unbelievable amount of play time. I have played for 72 hours and have not even began my career mode yet. I have my favorite trains and my favorite kinds of routes and scenarios. But I have yet to really explore any of the UK, German, or Asian routes and trains yet. I've been running freight across North America, and have not gotten into passenger trains yet. 72 hours, and I have barely scratched the surface. I think I am getting my money's worth.\n\nIf you are new to train Sims like me and just want to know what is a good place to start, I have a suggestion. Wait for a sale.. Then buy the TS2016 Steam edition. You get an extra route and more trains and content then with the base game. Then pickup the Aurora_Chicago route add on. This will give you a good mix of freight and passenger train scenarios to try. That's really all you need and should get at first. Try out the different types of scenarios, try out the different countries. Drive the different trains. Find out what interest you. Then target your DLC purchases around that. I went in thinking I would like the high speed European passenger trains, but I have fixated on the American freight trains so far. I have almost 70% of the DLC for North America now. That's quite a few pizzas, but I am happy with most of the DLC. Just like with the Sims stuff packs, sometimes you get something that leaves you feeling like there should be more to it for the money you just spent on this piece of DLC. But then there are plenty of others that are like getting 100% more game! So you need to try the different types of trains and activities to find out what you like. That is really the only way to get started with this game and the mountain of DLC. Hey if you want all $3000 worth of DLC for the game then go for it. But chances are 60% of it is not going to intrest you that much. Kind of like the Katie Perry expansion for Sims 3. What the hell do I want with a lollipop couch and a hot fudge futon?\n\nI know there are plenty of people on here and other sights that have been with this game since TS2009 and before. I can sympathize with their grief over all the yearly "updates" and roll out difficulties. I would be frustrated too if I was forced to upgrade a game that has been playing fine, and that I finally got all the bugs worked out of. Especially if I knew that the update would screw things up and introduce conflicts and errors and make my working game crash forcing me to start all over.  But they still play the game and that should tell you something. And the news is that Dovetail is not going to be "upgrading" TS2016. They are finally going to make their "Sims 2" version with TS2017. But Dovetail has promised to continue to support and produce DLC for TS2016 for the foreseeable future. So maybe not such a bad time to finally get into this game.\n\nAs far as performance issues, I cannot be of much help. As a Computer Engineer, I am baffled by the number of people who believe meeting the MINIMUM system requirements means they will be able to run the game on high graphics settings. Understand this, as it pertains to any game: If your system just meets the listed minimum system requirements, this means the game will run but at the lowest graphic settings and everything turned off. That is why it is called the MINIMUM system requirements. I have not experienced any crashes nor drops in frame rate or rendering problems with this game. I run all games on maxed graphics settings and all options turned on. Why? Because I am well beyond the minimum system requirements with my gaming platform. I run all my games on both my PC and my gaming laptop, switching between the two weekly because I travel.

Wrong speed markers or missing speed markers on routes (sherman hill being the worst), scenarios that simply didn't load (Isle of Mann). After repeatedly contacting the now dovetail manufacturer, all you ever get is some stock answer that they are aware of the issue, but never, I repeat never, do they actually fix the game. Surely there are rules to prevent any company selling a product that does not work, oh! of course there are, it's called trading standards. In any other walk of life if you have a faulty product you take it back and demand a working one - simple!!!\n\nNot being very computer savvy, I then bought the Steam version during the sale, got a few more DLC's whilst they were cheap, only to find the same old problems still existed. Look at all the reviews, mostly negative ones, they are all correct, there can be some enjoyment from this game/simulator, if only it worked. There's nothing worse than spending an hour of concentration, keeping to speed limits, folowing the instructions, trying to keep to time, only to hit a 30mph zone, at 29mph I might add, to suddenly see the 'speeding -6' repeating and all your efforts wasted as the speed allowed is actually 20mph. Surely the manufacturer 'tested' the product before releasing it. Apparantely not.\n\nThe only way to get this sorted and have a game that fulfils it's expectations is if all the users banded together, created a petition and approached trading standards with a 'class action' against Dovetail to repair all the issues within the game and put it right once and for all. If half their efforts (Dovetail) went into fixing the game instead of trying to censor the 'true' comments of concerned users, who are simply trying to get a working product, then all would be well.\n\nI'm also sure Steam are well aware of all these issues, yet they too seem impervious to users concerns, surely they should stop selling the product as it clearly is defective and not fit for purpose, Oh!, perhaps they simply make too much money out of it to be bothered.\n\nI have an old copy of Trainz (2009) on disc bought for a couple of quid, does the job, loads of stuff to do, and it works...\n\nDon't waste your money until you see that the game is fixed and works.","January 25, 2014","false","70.9"," 53 of 71 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","53","71","0","0"

There was a time when I believed this game would be. Don't make the same mistake as me. I sometimes find myself playing this just to make myself feel better about how much money I wasted on it.\n\nTo put it in perspective, I was able to use Microsoft Flight Simulator X to practice advanced topics for my real life pilots license, the base FSX software came with almost every airport in the world and a wide range of aircraft. In contrast, this GAME, by itself comes with virtually no content, the content it does come with is mediocre at best, and the realism level is severely lacklustre. Sadly, I've been foolish enough to spend more on this than on FSX, hoping it would eventually come remotely close in terms of delivering.\n\nIf you want to experience any variety in locomotives or scenery, you will have no choice but to purchase DLC. In my experience, the DLC is often as bare-bones as the base game and usually buggier, though seldomly priced less than entire full featured games. If my understanding is correct, you can't get additional skins for a locomotive, you have to pay full DLC price for each skin you want.\n\nIf your interest is in observing the spectacular outcome of a high speed derailment without all the loss of life, don't waste your time. As soon as the train derails the "simulation" ends and you're presented with a menu. Also, when you switch between front and back of the train cameras, the angle stays the same so you have to re-adjust every time you switch cameras.\n\nYou get an upgrade every year but I seldom find any observable improvement. If its possible to get any closer to a piece of software that performs zero function at all with the exception of allowing you the option to buy more of their software, Im sure it will be the only "improvement" in the 2015 edition. I'm convinced they really just change the name to something containing the current year so they can create the illusion that the game is new and justify charging exorbitant prices.\n\nI honestly mean to be constructive because I wish the devs would take advantage of the game's potential. I will say that the graphics are pretty decent. Par for the era. If noticable improvements in realism were made, and content prices were more realistic and reasonable -- combined with a dramatic change in how the company treats the customers (ie. fixing problems instead of covering complaints up, not charging sucker prices for questionable professionalism) the game could definitely have a future, but based on the current state of the above, I have to say 3/10.","December 9, 2013","false","242.8"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","36","44","0","0"

For starters the game is so unpredictable, one minute the game is fine the next it is suffering random crashes. The amount of bugs and glitches in the game, you would think that you was playing a very early alpha release. The company prides itself on been the best Train SImulator, which is not true in some respects but there is not much competition out there to rival the fact.\n\nAs you start to play the game its fairly good and has a fresh approach to the genre, although as you start to immerse yourself into the game and the community things start to change. This is a game which is very moddable, where users can create things and share there creations with the community. But there seems to be a trend where every modder wants to charge you for there work. Unlike Skyrim, GTA iv etc where the user content is varied and free, in this game you will find a lot of greed where people only do it to get money. So it is a very money orientated game. Even the freeware site that provides free content is subscription based, although you can download for free if you  want to wait an hour in a que.\n\nIt is this greed factor that contributes to the feeling of contempt every time you start the game, immediately faced with promotions to buy overpriced DLC that has bugs or does not work. You will also in time have to contact support as this is inevitable, everyone I have spoke to has done this. And you get an automated response, one of which outlines how there not that bothered.\n\nIf you are planning on doing some freeware projects for this game like I have done in the past, I would advice against it. As you will be faced with a barage of hate from a majority of the community. In short the game is just bad in game as well as out of it. The only major freeware project was the ecml, and the creator was abused on so many levels. So there idea of creating content was for me a big no, and one of the reasons why I stopped developing.\n\nThis is one game you should avoid at all costs, not only for your sanity but also for your wallet. If Steam has any credibility in protecting it's customers then it would be in there best interest to remove this game from there store.\n\nOverall has potential, but the greed,bad customer service, bugs and glitches and a majority of the community let's it down.\n\nAs a side note to show you what you can get for the same price as there DLC's including 3rd party DLC'S ( comparisons current from date of this review ):\n\nA second hand Rolex Watch\n\nLG 60" HD TV + XBOX One + Playstation 4\n\nTop of the range Alienware Desktop Pc\n\n150+ Full priced Steam Games\n\nand if your a train fan, 6 Luxury Train Holidays in the UK.\n\nQuick Edit: This company have changed there name to Dovetail and have appointed a new executive from EA, says it all really. And to top things off this company have tried to hide negative comments by marking them as ' off topic '. Shows how much they do not want you to hear the negative side of things. Every game gets negatives but thats part and parcel of games, but i have not seen other companys trying to ignore customer feedback on Steam as much as these.","December 10, 2013","false","178.5"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","34","41","0","2"

I have a computer that can handle any game at maximum stettings, but this game will bring it to it's knees because of bad design. There is too much focus on DLC wich may not sound like a problem, but the pricing for the DLC makes it seem like RSC is  more focused on the profits than the experience of the game. There are a lot of areas of the game that can be improved. It seems like they are only putting a new user interface on the same game every year and calling it new. With the amout of money they charge for DLC one would think that they could afford to overhaul the game and give it a fresh start instead of a fresh new menu every year. I think the DLC should be half of the price they want to chrge for it. Yes, I realize that there is work that goes into each piece of DLC. I also know how much work goes into creating a route.

I recommend buying the 2012 version because it's cheaper than the steam version and will upgrade automatically to 2015, honestly this game is terrible in my opinion, has way too many problems with the AI system and there is not many features either. The DLC is also overpriced, and some of them don't even work properly. DTG in my opinion only cares about money and not about the people who play their game, they bring out all these overpriced DLC's and not focus on fixing the bugs in the game. They just want people to buy their trains and once they have a lot of people buy it they update the game, only to find out that the update is no different and all the bugs are still there. Microsoft Train Simulator is a whole lot better than this in many ways and other Train Sims aswell. This game is good and all but I would it's not worth buying for 40$. I would say it's probably worth 15$-20$ because of all the problems and besides, they have DLC. The game itself is 40$ and when you buy a route, it's like another 40$, and for a train itself, it would be 20$. That would be very expensive, so if you are very sure you want to buy a game that the developers rarely update and with many unbelievable problems that just ruin the experience then I recommend buying the 2012 disc version at a store like walmart or target, if not buy it online, it's very cheap, about 20 bucks or less.

Up until now, the main reason I didn't get it, was the price. However, during Steam's recent autumn sale, the christmas DLC was 80% off, and since it didn't need the (expensive) core game to play, I decided this was my chance to try it out and see for myself how I like it.\n\nWell, the game itself could be fun for a while, but my overall experience wasn't all on the positive side. While the game doesn't seem too complicated, the interface isn't very comfortable, to say the least. It took me a while just to figure out where exactly I'm supposed to stop to complete a scenario. You'd think it should be really simple, right? Well, so would I. At first I thought that maybe I was just being stupid and impatient, so I gave it some time and soon enough I figured it out. Regardless, I was feeling a little cheated, sort of like "Okay, I got it, I completed the scenario, but what now? Is that supposed to be it? Where's the fun!?".\n\nStill not being sure whether I should give this little game more time or not, I figured I'd go read reviews on Steam, see what other people think, and then I encountered the reason for my decision not to get the game. It seems like the moderators the developers assigned to moderate the reviews to their game are quite the dictators. Watch how they mark this review as "off-topic", just like they did with the other negative reviews this game received. While those reviews described flaws and drawbacks regarding the game, they were fair, to the point and as on-topic as you can get.\n\nIt seems like the developers of this game would go quite far to hide any negative criticism, justified as it may be. If this is how it works, it makes me wonder - what are they so worried about? What are they working so hard to hide from everyone? I don't know about you, but if I ever find out, I promise you - it won't be by playing the game itself. Those guys are not getting any of my money. Not only because I have doubts about the game (and I do still have doubts), but mainly because I feel I'm being manipulated and left in the dark.\n\nIn conclusion, while I'm still not completely sure about the game itself, the attitude of the developers made me decide to stay away from this game, and I suggest to you to stay away as well.","December 4, 2013","false","17.8"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","34","43","0","0"

Unfortunately they all proved to be true.\n\nThere are plenty of bugs and the graphics are outdated. Instead of fixing existing bugs, they keep producing more overpriced DLC, with even more bugs that most likely won't be fixed. And a game this CPU, RAM and GPU intensive that isn't 64bit in 2014 is almost embarassing. My new high end computer can barely handle some DLC, due to the fact that the game can't use the resources available.\n\nThe worst part however is not the bugs or that the game isn't updated to make use of newer and better technology, the worst part is the developer's apparent lack of will to fix the problems and their awkward and sometimes outright negative attitude towards the community.

I got this game for me and my father to play together since we have been rail fans for years. Ever since I can remember. My passion was HO models while his was G-scale. Anyways, when I got this game i was expecting....more. I dont like the simplicity of the free roam, how it has only one set map (even after I got two others) and creating (truly) can be fun to some, but sadly I'm to busy to spend days on end just making a map. I live in Garden Grove California, not far from the actual Pacific Surfliner, heck I see that thing almost daily on the Amtrak/Metrolink line. Anyways, the point I'm trying to get across is "Why is there only one map and one set of trains allowed in Free Roam?"\n\nI'm a HUGE fan of steam trains, my personal favorite is the UPBB 4-8-8-4. I even got to see the 4014 (Soon to be the only running one of its kind) and I was amazed. Now to drive that thing down the Surfliner track in free roam would be amazing! But... the downside is....I can't. Why? well, i believe the developers made it abit more...realistic in the sense of that most of the tracks in the game are all urban areas, not freight or rural areas like the Pass. I can kinda see the point there. But seriously. I wanna just.....PLAY! Not have a task list. Being able to go from San Diego to LA without having to worry about other trains and scenario finishers. I wanna be able to control where my train goes.\n\nThe pass is fun, sure, but there's such long distances between most of the switch tracks that you hafta choose right at the beginning by checking your map (again, the Pass is a rural area through the mountains so cant really B**ch) and the closest thing TO a quick drive free roam is the Holiday Express. You can control the track at least in there....but still, the map is so tiny....nothing really to do there.. You cant go anywhere cause of the lack of FREE ROAM! Seriously....The word FREE is in it.... 0.0 Shouldn't there be more? Unless this is a ploy to make us waste our money away on nothing but scenarios and trains and no GOOD free roam maps....\n\nAnyways. I still wanna see the rest of the maps. I haven't even been able to see that skew off on London-Faversham. There's a whole lengthy track I've never seen! that probably no one has ever seen. Why? Cause there's no Free Roam for it. Only A-B.... Anyways, I've rambles your ears off and you're probably tired of reading. Just asking for a lot more for the money I've put into the game for me and my dad to enjoy a game where you can only do 2 things.... (The standard game + 6 DLCs: 4 trains and 2 maps).\n\n(Update as of May 06, 2015):\nIs it just me or are the prices going UP for the DLC of this game? I'm looking around and they are STILL ridiculously over priced. Yet I do see something....strange.  Or o it just me. Some of the DLC are saying: You do NOT need Train Simulator 2015 to play this game. Now to me that's just plain weird... Are you telling me that your so-called ADD-ONS are also STAND ALONE GAMES? Dafuq is the use of that? Hmmmm. Dovetail...have you ever thought of, oh I dunno... reducing the price of your DLCs to below $20 USD period and maybe...just MAYBE you'd get more people to buy yo sh*t?\n\nI....really don't think so considering the developers of this game either 'hide' the negative reviews or just plain ignore them. I dunno what kind of company they are, but they are doing a bad job promoting such an unbelievable amazing game. I bet if their DLCs were cheaper and not trying to be sold as Stand-Alone content, a lot more people may find this game more enjoyable and want to play more of it and, oh I dunno... SPEND MORE MONEY MAYBE! TAKE THE HINT! It also may hafta do with them being British...or not from the US....Dunno.

While I do run a below bottom end computer, the game initially lived up all my hopes and dreams despite the horrific framerate (which after disabling TSX and dropping many other graphical settings usually hovers between 14-15, occasionally going higher to 24 or more, which is good enough for me). Though I quickly lost interest in route building after realizing how time consuming it was.\n\nWell my opinion of the game has been changing since then and I feel like I also need to share what I think of the game noow and add to the growing list of negative reviews despite this being my first review ever and my sloppy writing style.\n\nWhile I don't hate the game, I've become disappointed to the point I no longer recommend it to anyone or scramble for the DLC.\n\nOne of my biggest issues isn't the pricing (not saying I don't have issues about it), it's the quality. The routes tend to be very good in my opinion despite the lack of TSX and reduced density in my case, but the same isn't as true with the locomotives and that was the first thing that made me start thinking "Is this really the game I wanted for over two years?"\n\nWhile driving around on Sherman Hill I noticed the sounds, specifically the horns, weren't consistent enough. One locomotive would have a loud horn, but another may have a horn that was dramatically lower in volume. Vastly different bell sounds and quality also disappointing, like the Challenger having such a bell that sounds much too high pitched.\n\nLights are another common disappointment. The variation in all the different styles quickly becomes an eyesore when you start mixing and matching units. Especially with the new headlight glare from the upgraded locomotives (though it does look awesome). The Cab Forward takes the lighting issue to another level with not even having the textures for one of the marker lamps in the correct locations.\n\nThe best example of lack of quality in my mind is the A4 pack. While the driving programming is decent, the unrealistically quiet whistles kills much of the fun of driving them. Then there's Dominion of Canada. I was highly disappointed that not only did the sound not match the whistle's appearance, but also the bell didn't function (though I recognize that bells aren't usually needed in the UK).\n\nGraphics and sound aside, you then come to functionality. While all the basic functions are simulated, how well they are simulated varies. The brakes aren't realistic across all locomotives (though the Marias units are well simulated with their dynamic braking). I'm told that independent brakes are the best for stopping locomotives running light, but I have yet to see independent braking make a difference at all, in fact I wrecked on my first scenario because of it. Then there's throttle operation on some diesel locomotives where the amps instantly jump to one point and the rpms slowly catch up, I would only find this realistic when reducing power not increasing power. I've discovered that the operation of certain features aren't consistent inside and outside of the locomotive, such as the case of the road locomotive included with Marias Pass where all wipers are moving outside the locomotive, but one of the wipers isn't moving on the inside.\n\nMy latest disappointment is also my biggest, how Railsimulator treats its community, trying to keep the bugs in the dark to the point where reviews are targeted. If a company is taking extreme measures to try keeping bugs and glitches in the dark instead of fixing them, then their products aren't worth buying regardless of price.\n\nUntil they stop trying to censor and start fixing bugs and issuing the patches free of charge (for everything and I don't mean introducing another version you have to pay for just to get one problem fixed), I don't recommend you invest in this game. No company should ever treat their community like this and expect to get away with it. If they straighten up their act and start fixing this game like the community wants, then I will start recommending this game again and with much more effort than I ever did.","December 7, 2013","false","931.5"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","29","35","0","0"

There are some issues with the textures, where they flicker (especially if you are on maps that has water; you can see flickering where the water meets the land, but there are various instances all over the game); but overall the game is not showing tremendous corruption.\nThe train itself are made quite nicely; lots of details on the outside; inside they are so-so, with some good textures but overall very simplicistic and not super detailed. Considering that they are the main point of the game, I would expect something similar to other products in the simulation realm  (like airplane or car simulators; just to mention few...this is a simulator after all, so it has to be compared to other sims).\nThe object on the side of the route are many and well done; not super but they do their good immersion job.\n\nThe arrangement of the objects and scenery thou may vary from map to map...some are quite stunning, with light effects and awesome arrangement; while others (like the mountain maps with snow), are so dull and bland.\nAlso you can see in the distance the issue with object placements, where tree just disappear, and you see basically the area that goes from tree populated, to bald.\n\nThe human 3d models are quite atrocious: their animations are approximate, there is very little variation among the meshes and textures, and also the collision and AI is quite disappointing....at times they just go for a spin, walking around the same spot like a dog running behind its tail. This is more evident if you just sit in a station and set the external camera. After a bit they just go trough scenery items, or start to act totally weird.\n\nThe cars are OK; after all you don't have to have many different ones, since you rarely see them, but at the crossing they are there, and you can see that the variation is limited to 2-3 types. Also their collision with the ground is uneven...in some maps you see them sinking in the ground plane....\n\nThe engine seems to work decently, but using high speed trains, you can see the framerate getting choppy (2x8 core processors, Radeon 5870, which is able to run more demanding games with impeccable performances); it feels like the engine is not that optimized, or maybe is based on old technology (I didn't follow the whole story of the company honestly, I just know that they are around since quite some time). At times feels like an indie game made with these free SDK like Unity or UDK, instead than a dedicated engine (nothing wrong with indie SDK; but you need to know your limitations).\n\nBut I can live with these issues in the end, altho the main problems are on the central gameplay itself.\n\nYou are basically a conductor (engineer), and the main point is the career, where you go trough scenery after scenery, which has different tracks and trains, and get rated based on your performace on 3 categories :\n- comfort of passengers (basically how good you are with accelerating and breaking)\n- Speed limits compliance\n- time table compliance\n\nThe idea is fabulous; but the implementation is full of issues.\n\nI tried few scenarios, and there is an underlying problem with speed: there is a screen that show you where the speed limits are, so you can act accordingly and set the train to the right speed. Once you pass the limit by 1 MPH, you get the alert of speeding and you start to loose points.\nThis is where the issues start.\n\nThe first problem is that the limit does not allow you any kind of room to fail....either you time perfectly your brake and acceleration, or you start to slow down too early, which makes you loose time (which reflects on the time table compliance; since the schedule is quite tight ). No room for errors, which is unrealistic (isn't this a sim?)\n\nAny person that drive a train knows, that you are allowed to exceed the limits to stay on schedule, by a certain percentage; while here the developers decided to set it to 1 MPH. Now the justification is "it is to make it harder and more realistic"; while the truth is that is easier to just set things in this way, instead than work around a flexible way to allow speeding; and give different kind of penalty to players.\n\nThe second issue is due to the incorrect sync of the speed limit between the map and the main view. You are nicely riding, look at the map, see the signal and prepare to slow down...and then out of the blue, the limit change and you find yourself speeding when you are few miles away from the signal.\nThis happened to me almost in any scenario that I tried so far; basically the map that you see on your display, is not synced with the track, giving you incorrect data. Playing like that is like to drive a submarine with an elementary school map not in scale.\n\nYou will loose a ton of points, get frustrated and overall, end up not enjoying the game.\nIn one instance; I had a limit of something like 225 KPH, I was at 190 KPH, then at one point, while approaching a station (after playing for 30 minutes or so); the limit changed out of the blue, and the train engaged the emergency alarm. I ended up being stopped in a tunnel, 2 miles away from the station, and no chance to have the train to restart (the alarm was on; even after resetting the alarm, it would not allow me to move the train no matter what). I had to restart the mission and throw a couple of things from my desk on the wall, for the frustration. Nobody mentioned that you need to put in neutral, then pull the brake control all the way back, then start again...not even the manual.\n\nThen let's talk about the content itself: the base game is limited to few tracks; so if you want a career, you need to buy DLC (20-40 USD a pop). Which is absurd, after spending money for the main game. Imagine Final fantasy where after the first mission ask you to go buy the DLC to continue the game.\n\nLast disappointment: the editor for the various scenarios and tracks; I was not able to even use it. The camera was stuck under the floor.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 5 out of 10; avoid at full price; may be worth at discounted price. I doubt that they listen to their customers, and this show already from how their site is organized: the king is DLC and screenshots, while there is no forum, no FAQ, no support area, other than an email. You know how a company works when you see at how they setup their site.\nYou may enjoy it for an occasional train ride (maybe for your little ones), but as simulator this game is insufficient on many aspects.","December 16, 2013","false","59.7"," 35 of 46 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","35","46","0","0"

I still can't believe I spent over $50 on this totally crappy game. I played it for barely 3 hours before I realized I will never want to play this game again and uninstalled it.\n\nThe base game has very little content out of the box and DLCs cost so much I thought it was some sort of a glitch with Steam at first, then reading the forums I realized it is how the routes and train model are priced. I still can't believe they are seriously trying to charge $20-$40 for a route or train model.\n\nThe game comes with no tutorials to speak of. There are supposed to be tutorials in the game and they do appear in the list of in game tutorials but trying to run them gives some cryptic error. I had to dig through the forums to figure out that these tutorials are leftovers from previous versions of the game and require some DLC (which of course, I will never buy).\n\nThe game crashes too often. By today's standards, It doesn't look all that great graphically. The User Interface feels like it was designed by a fresh year student as a home project.

Alarm bells rang with me then, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and I persisted with this game through to 2015, even though the company, by now called Dovetail, had effectively closed off any sort of communication with themselves, were selling, selling, selling - but made no visible effort to correct any of the major bugs now being sold to us.\n\nAs someone else here said, while it can satisfy the rail fans wish of driving a train (at least virtually), it doesn't do it very well. A plethora of never to be fixed bugs, a greedy development team and addons which are overpriced, fluctuate in quality and usually have some part (such as sounds) either recycled from older addons or completely inaccurate.

I've played it for several hours learning how to drive those trains, and found out how buggy this game can be.\n\nFirst of all - I like simulations. I already own Truck Simulator and have had my fun with it. Train simulator is great deal different, but i still like the idea of driving these heavy machines. I also have patience to learn through trial and error, so with this in mind:\n- A loco, having towed 20 cars doesn't have wheel slip, then all of a sudden, while towing 10 of them it HAS ENORMOUS wheel slip, so you have to apply ony 20-25% power and accelerate to 80kph, can't apply more power or wheel slip at e.g. 40kph. What's the deal with that? Sunny day, by the way.\n- You know how side track view (the one at the bottom) shows speed limits, then all of a sudden one of them grows just in front of my train, there's no way I could have slowed down as not to cause my train to enter emergency-brake mode or incur a penalty.\n- Red lights ocassionally show up right after a 90 degree turn with no indication beforehand. This is in one of these scenarios with intermodal train, Hamburg - Hanover route, fourth difficulty level.\n\nGame loading speed is abysmal. My kettle boils water faster. I have decent PC, mind you, games are on 4x2TB Raid drive. Should be fast, right? Other games load fast. Lots of texture flickering on screen. Game looks like it had no anti-alias at all. And in 1080p resolution. Truck simulator has an option which can increase detail at distance if you had enough power. Here said distance is minimal, try changing FOV in order to observe distant train - it sometimes even appears half-way under ground, which is funny.... not.\n\nAnd what the heck is it with all these route or loco DLCs carrying whole game price tag... I mean you can have fun with only these 3 routes provided... but not for long.\n\nAnyway, wasted potential, for a simulator. The fact that I have bought it at Christmas Sale price saves it a bit though.","December 26, 2013","false","56.6"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","29","38","0","2"

I purchased the 'Sir Lamiel' add-on, but it is not visible anywhere in the menus to play :-(  Waste of money ! Some of the route DLCs are 'over-priced' for what actually are and some of the controls are very 'odd' ; eg. out of the cab views, forward and rear do not 'add up' to what you would see - many diesel/electric locos switch to the 'other end' if you look backwards to see the consist behind :-(  A few of the sounds are annoyingly repetitive and intrusive ; US cab radio 'traffic', UK level-crossing warning, GWR 0-6-0PT brake squeal to name just three !  Some of the scenarios appear just impossible to complete with unachievable timescales unless you are driving 'Concorde' - do the developers/testers actually try out all of these before publishing/selling to the paying public ?

The tutorial is a very short run on a generic electric train that only shows you the very basic controls. It doesn't tell you that there are speed "limits" (which you get penalized if you exceed by 2 km/h and "suggested" speeds that if exceeded by "too much" (how much is anyone's guess because there's nothing explained about them) suddenly slams on the emergency braking system (which they also don't tell you how to de-activate) which results in you being penalized first for having the emergency systems activated and then because you are decelerating quickly, then penalizes you for poor ride quality. Did I mention there's no manual for any of this? Or that this mission after the tutorial is the easiest?\n\nOh yes, when you start the second mission it neglects to tell you that you must raise the arm to conact the overhead power lines, or which control does this. If you look at the outside of the train with the chase cam at the front of the train, you will not see the arm raise or lower because the one at the BACK of the train is going up and down. So unless you happen to click the right camera view there is no indication that you are hooked up or not.\n\nThe "suggested" speed comes on from 225 km/h and says to slow to 200, then to 170, then straight to 100... and if you'r enot already braking hard from 170 down ( why would you there's no indication you would have to...) it slams on the brakes...\n\nThe HUD shows your speed in MPH and the dashboard shows it in km/h... And the two don't have a precise match. So, if you are enjoying your run outside the train with one of the chase cams, you can easily start speeding and get penalized for it. There's also no way (that I can find because there's no manual... Did I mention that?) to change the units the HUD displays. When you pause it it gives you 2 options in the menu. Turn the HUD off, set it to minimal or full. The other option is the opacity of the HUD. That's it.\n\nThe people that walk in the station look like pigeons strutting around, wih no natural walking motion whatsoever. They also appear to be walking on spongy concrete and clip into the station floor.\n\nHere's the best part, the run they pick for the first 2 missions is in England. It involves driving through a LOT of underground tunnels. Guess what there is to see in a tunnel... NOTHING! So you spend minutes at a time driving a train through a dark tunnel. Even if you turn the lights on you still can't see anything. What idiot was responsible for picking a run that puts you in the dark for your learning missions? Why not put you on a run somewhere open and bright and allow you to enjoy the scenery, mechanics of the engine etc.?  Oh yes, when it rains, you can wipe the window with the wipers and it clears a patch where the wipers are. But... When you speed up and achieve over 200 km/h, that apparently has no affect on the rain still on the windscreen.\n\nI haven't played the free roam mode yet, but if they make the beginning this frustrating, I have really no interest in the rest. I should say that I am an avid rail fan and I have been since I was little. I have ridden the cab of steam engines on excursions, I have chased iconic trains through the Rocky mountains, watched the train climb the Spiral tunnels in the Rockies and a lot more. This is a bitter disappointment and I'm glad I only paid 10 bucks for it.","March 22, 2014","false","5.1"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","26","34","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fourbitty/recommended/24010/","fourbitty","FourBitty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fourbitty/","21 products in account","So I finally got the pleasure of downloading the 1.4GB update to TS2016. I went to load my custom consist with SD70s on Union Pacific's Sherman Hill, one of my favourite routes. I haven't read into it enough to know whether or not this is supposed to be a beta, I hope it is because this new version is just awful. Instead of background music you only hear the continuous winter wind blowing on the menu screens from the introduction video. Exciting. There's no loading bar or screens to showcase recently released routes/trains as there was in the past, you get to stare at a black screen for several seconds/minutes and hope your desired route/scenario is still loading. The SD70 which was my favourite locomotive for being one of few with excellent audio, has been 'improved' to now sound nothing like a train. Rolling stock over the tracks sounds are even more terrible. On top of it all, the stupid brake decrease glitch - which I first discovered driving Soldier Summit's SD40-2 which requires you to spam the decrease button to shut the brakes off - has now also plagued my beloved SD70.\n\nThis is an embarrassment. Not only for Dovetail, but for me, having spent so much money on this. They've even seemed to have taken a step backwards as far as optimization goes, as this is now the only game I play where I can't achieve 60FPS (I don't even know if I'm getting 30) with an i5 and a GTX970 ACX2.0 on a 1440p monitor. If you haven't already, I highly suggest you do not update and resume playing TS2015. In my eyes, after this update, this game has fallen to "shovelware" (Google it if you don't know what that means) like quality. I'm not a person to rant, but this is an abomination. I pity the folks who have spent even more than I have on Dovetail's now even ♥♥♥♥♥ier DLCs. If I'm off my wagon and this is supposed to be some kind of Beta (Alpha??) or if there's other routes that have seen real improvements, please let me know. I'd like to have some sort of hope that the Train Sim I've enjoyed in the past has some potential to be playable again.\n\nAs far as the "All the DLC would cost over $3,000, that's stupid!" I don't really see the point of complaining about that, you certainly don't need to purchase more than a couple routes to enjoy the game. With that said, paying $44 CAD for a route I expect it to not have the poor optimization and bugs that they have. Even on sale they still cost too much for what they are. This wouldn't be the case if they worked like they should and didn't have any issues - these things you don't learn about until after you've spent your money. So yes, folks are right to complain about the price because most of them don't see how bad the routes are until after thay've made the purchase.\n\nThe icing on the cake is the beautiful video they have showcasing the UP Turbine, which features absolutely no in-game footage. Their beautiful In-Detail videos on YouTube and screenshots are appealing, but hide the truth about how horrible this game is/has become.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm disappointed to say that this update has officially killed the game for me. The sheer amount of bugs, glitches, and scenery issues would be tolerable if the game cost $10 and DLCs cost $5, but the state that Dovetail has released this game and at the pricepoint it and the DLCs, in addition to the ways that they advertise the game as mentioned above, is more than wrong, it's immoral. I do not recommend anyone spends any money on this game and supports these people for what they are doing.","September 24, 2015","false","117.5"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","26","34","0","0"

The graphics are fairly good overall, but I think tweaks here and there are needed. In terms of controls, they are fairly realistic to my knowledge in terms of setup. The wheelslip is fairly accurate, as starting a train on a snowy hill side is a pain in the ♥♥♥ (as it should be).\nRoutes are fairly accurate in detail.\n\n[h2]The Bad Things[/h2]\n\nFor starts, this game is spammed with DLC. And it isn't done correctly. I payed nearly twenty bucks for this thing when it was on a sale exceeding 50%. Given my tight as hell budget, that was pushing it. I hoped that it would be worth it. Wrong. For starts, you get maybe three different overall routes, about a total of a dozen senarios (not including tutorals),  a little over a half-dozen locomotives (half of which cannot be drived outside of Quick-Drive), and next to nothing in terms of passenger services. Freight, freight, frieght. Last time I checked, that was what it was like in most of the US. While I am from the US, I do wish to remind you that I live in Illinois, an area which sees a good amount of public transport being by train. And I know as far as Europe that it is practically a nessisaty.\nSo in order to get more content, I need to get DLC. And it isn't the $1.99 type of DLC either. I'm talking full price. If you want another route, more engines, freight, etc. and maybe 4-5 more scenarios, then expect to pay at least $20...more likely it will be above that. How many Steam engines come with this game? One. And it is in the stupid Academy paint scheme. It looks real dumb when you want to drive one, and the only way to do that is to play a quick drive and try to ignore all the electric and diesel trains that flash past you, making you look kinda stupid.\nNow, with wheelslip. Is it something that people like? Hell no. But last time I checked, wheelslip is usually something that is out of a driver's control. I'm sorry I gotta start on a steep hill with a 50 car train; that light was red. But I don't think I should be forced to give next to no throttle and allow my train to slide down helplessly, or risk recieveing huge-♥♥♥ penalties.\nNow I know you guys are not exactly aiming for a 100% realistic road simulator. I mean, that's kind of a given to me. But on the other hand, I don't think most railroad crossings have the lights going off well before the gates even go off. And I mean that your train is doing 30 miles an hour, up a steep hill, and still close to a mile from the crossing. Then on top of that, the middle of the train will still be crossing through when the gates will go up. I mean do you know how stupid it looks when that happens? And then lets have them drive through the train like it's a hologram.\nThe speed limit is kinda crazy. I think most people will go five over and not have much of a penalty. But when you are are triple-digit speeds, the tenth-of-a-mile in the speedometer goes away. And if you suddenly are going 121 miles an hour instead of 120, then say good-bye to your points. Also, a little hard for most trains to go down a steep as hell hill with a massive freight train, and manage to spend the entrie time at a slug-like pace of a mere 25 miles an hour. I'm sure more then one engineer have gotten bored with the sluggishness and went a little bit over on the straightaways to cut down some time. They aren't being reckless.\nDerailments are horrible in terms of accuracy. I understand that you are not wanting to focus on such a thing, but face it; these things happen. That said, four railcars derailing should not make the entire 50-car train derail as well. That's kinda stupid.\n\nIt's a good game. It has potental. But poor physics, next to no content without paying hundreds of dollars, abnormally-strict rules, among other things make what could be a fantastic game into a mediocure-at-best pile of ♥♥♥♥.","May 9, 2015","false","33.9"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","1"

I like trains, I like train simulators (OpenBVE being by far the best and is free) but Train Simulator 2014 (2012 when I bought it) is so...lacklustre.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the visual detail ranges from adequate (ground textures, houses, cars) to impressively realised (stations, viaducts, overall scenery) however it is in how you drive the train which is very uninteractive.  I draw comparisons to OpenBVE because everything has a button and each diesel/electric train has throttle *positions* rather than a throttle that cannot be set to go at a certain percentage (and goes through the power level percentages extremely smoothly), the sounds recorded by amateurs for OpenBVE have the realism that Train Simuator lacks (trains sound like they are idling, even when the throttle is at 100% and going up a gradient) and if you care about the little details (such as replying to the guard's buzzer) then you're going to notice their conspicuous absence.\n\nFor the most part you will be sat there doing nothing, whereas in OpenBVE you would be constantly adjusting throttle and braking to ensure best possible speed, time and passenger comfort (should you be doing a passenger run) or taking into account how the freight changes the handling.  This is the kind of pressure that's present in Euro Truck Simulator (which is disappointing on a different level, but not in terms of the actual driving of the trucks) but not here in Train Simulator 2014.\n\nI even bought the Settle-Carlisle pack during the sale, just to see if the experience would be any different to those included as standard.  The answer, rather resoundingly, is no as the trains still sound awful (the horns may as well be weak synth or foleyed car horns, the steam engine noises are equally weak), the amount of interactivity is negligible and when there is pressure on the more difficult routes? Be prepared for awful controls and trains that need to go to their virtual depot for either scrapping or rebuilding from scratch as they are that poor in terms of performance.\n\nI would have loved to have said that Train Simulator was - at least - good.  But it isn't.  Until Train Simulator receives a thorough reworking, it is best that you avoid this and either go buy a train set; play OpenBVE/Transport Tycoon or volunteer at your local heritage railway.  You'll save a lot of money (especially where all the DLC combined costs over £1000 prior to a Steam sale) and you'll have a far more enriching experience.","December 8, 2013","false","25.2"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

I can't run the tutorials because they simply won't load, and half the time the game either crashes or the menu doesn't load properly. Really disappointed, it had so much potential.

In fact, they should've called it, "Trains and zombies, friendship is magic" as, most of the time, zombies will just engage in social talk on the boarding station or make happy parties around burning wreckages.\nAnyhow, scenario goes like this: You drive a train in New-York suburds, weather goes bad (or so they tell you), random walking NPC's skin turns green, oh god zombies (or so they tell you again) , you must get as far as possible, fearing that people might laugh at you for cosplaying Green Giant®.\nMost of the fun you will ever get from this game should be made by you, goofing around unrailing your train and trying two wheelers. Going from a quality perspective, graphics are horribly simplistic (especially for a game which, in the end, is only sightseeing), pacing feels like everyone in the world has went to "special people" school, music is inexistant and glitches are frequent occurence as NPC's do tend to park their car around 50 meters above ground, in mid-air.","December 22, 2013","false","4.7"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","0"

So you will be looking at spending around £25 per route, once you have completed all the scenarios for the few existing routes that you got with the game.\n\nYou can download free stuff from steam for this game e.g. routes, scenarios etc, but be warned - You will find that you still need to buy more routes and add-on packs to actually play them and make them work.\n\nI downloaded the 56xx GWR Steam Loco add on for this game in loving memory of my Dad who always wanted to drive a steam train (I thought I'd complete his ambition for him). When I went to the tutorial list for this class of loco - I found that I could not play any of the scenarios or use the tutorial because I don't have the "Memories Of Maerdy" route add on priced at £17.99\n\nWhat's also annoying for me is not all of the listed scenarios in this game are playable using the loco's that you already have with the original game. If you attempt to play one - You just get greeted with an in game pop-up advising you that you need to purchase yet another route to play this scenario.\n\nIt's full of bugs too - e.g. people walking across the track at a stations, people walking through scenery, people walking through each other, cars hovering above the road at rail crossings, the game randomly crashing etc.\n\nUnless you are an absolute die hard rail fan - Best not to bother because you'll end up spending far too much money trying to improve this game with over priced add-on's to make it more interesting, before you realise that it's just not worth it.\n\nI purchased this when it was on special offer, and after playing it for quite a while now - I still think that it was over priced then for what it is.\n\nTo me - A simulator should fully immerse you inside it, making you forget what reality you are actually in for a while.

The game is a nightmare to play, just figuring out how to START the game requires watching youtube tutorials.  There are so many menus with 99% of them being useless instead of just letting me play the game, its telling me stats, there are offers for buying more Train DLC but there is no option to play the game ANYWHERE on the frist set of menus, to play the game requires navigating about 7-8 menus correctly, make the wrong choice and you start over, or worse the game freezes crashing.  The controls are terrible, using a controller still requires a mouse and keyboard, operating a real train would be easier than this game.  Is this game a joke?  Seems my trains they only go backwards using the left trigger.  Wanna see how bad the design of the game is without buying the game or downloading a demo?  Lets look at how dumb the game designers are.  On this store page click visit the forums, see those couple locked topics at the top.  The designers even managed to mess up steams forums which work for every other game, to get to their forums, you need to click an option on the right.  Avoid this and all its DLC they managed to vomit onto steam, go buy a real train at the store for the same price, its more fun and will work, plus you can go all Addams family make the trains hit eachother which you cant do in this game.\n\nWhats really strange with this game is the more people play it the more they hate it, looking over the review most people with over 100 hours of gameplay hate the game, but people with under 1 hour like the game.

The only way I'd buy it as the price tag is quite high, so I could pick on the Steam version with some extra stuff. Well, besides the price tag, what else the game offers? not many things.\n\nLet's start complimenting theese guys on making a visually good game. By visually good, I say it by making textures for dirty windows, rain drops on the windows, and other enviromental stuff, but, the textures on both interior and exteriors aren't that much good looking, as on a resolution of 1366x768 I can't read some of the things written in the cab controls. About controls, they have support for a controller, but you can't customize the controls, and what about the conductor to help you out?\n\nAnother down side of this game is the missions, with and EXTREMELY short timetable. A second more or less to press the load/unload command and you're already late and loosing points, not to say that you have to figure out the exact distance to start braking from the speed limit to stop wit the entire train on the station, toherwise you're loosing points too. Physics? they have some good things but bad things, but I'd say they still have some work to do.\n\nWhat about the IMMENSE number os DLC's? they throw you off from playing this game, they give you a loco on the tutorial that ISN'T EVEN AVAILABLE TO PLAY!, what the heck are you doing people? Still, work to polish your engine, I'm running it on a decent and considered high end machine and it lags, that shouldn't be happening IMO.\n\nThis is my first review on a game, and it's a negative one. I gave you a chance on this, and I'm not happy with it, you lost a possible client. For everyone else up to buy it, get it on a heavy discount, it's not worth it unless it's 75% off or more, maybe don't even buy it, save for something better","December 6, 2014","false","6.3"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"

The base game itself is quite positive for those looking to have a realistic driving experience (3rd or 1st person), but the reason i advise non-train buffs to not purchase it is because of the amount of facts and figures you will come across and the fact that if you are not into it, then the DLCs are useless. The total DLC cost is well over a £3000 which makes it an incredibly over-priced game for what it is; a simulator. For £3000 you could buy a real train. Although, being an enthusiast myself, it is excellent to have a wide range of locomotives, routes and skin packs to be able to customize your fleet. A real con is where they sell you a train for £11.99 and call it new even though it has only been re-skined. Of course you do not have to buy every single DLC, but for instance I have spent over £150 on DLCs alone, way too much for a simulator. A good feature of this game is the create your own route feature. This is very complex but once you have learnt the basics, an excellent way to plan out a model railway. There are also modes such as free-roam (self-explanatory), scenario based, career scenario based and quick drive. Quick drive was added in quite a recent update and is one of my preferred modes; you are able to select any locomotive on any route, setting the time and day etc... Comparibly the scenarioes are excellent and with the addition of the workshop are seemingly endless. Overall, not a great game but don't allow the 200 and something hours tell you otherwise; please note, this was a big waste of my life and I do not want it to be yours. This game (even though I stated it was good for enthusiasts etc...) makes dept a real issue and if you're stupid enough to add all of the DLCs to the cart then you might as well get another bank account. I may play it an awful lot, but honestly the outdated graphics may be the best for a train simulator, but the development company to take over this game hasn't evolved since the 1998. The trains do look excellent, but the AI are all the same in effect only retextured to the time period or the characters gender. I'd say a 4/10 would be being pleasant to the developers but it isn't a good choice for Christmas. I would plead you not to purchase an absorbing 2009/10 based sim that hasn't been updated (as in the bugs fixed or graphice improved) since its release.","January 20","false","254.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","15","18","8","4"

If so please look elsewhere.\n\nThe idea is good and I know simulations are not for everyone but the implementation is dire. There are repeated bugs and crashes and every update seems to introduce new problems without fixing the old ones.\n\nThere are 2 sides to this game. Driving stuff and building stuff in the editor.\n\nDriving first.\n\nHaving never driven a train I cannot say if the simulation side is accurate, what I can say is that the missions and game play can be frustrating.\n\nYou get a handful of trains and routes from the outset and can purchase any number of additional DLC from Dovetail (or whatever they are calling themselves now) and 3rd party devs. There are missions where you have to take a train from one place to another in a tight time-table without speeding, falling of the tracks,crashing or going through a red signal which is harder than it sounds. Trains do not stop quickly, or like rain, hills etc so running on time is tough and it is very easy to miss a speed restriction resulting in a failure (or no awarded points).\n\nMissions can last over a hour and you will loose if you go through a red signal, or make a serious mistake,. There is a quick save (press F2 - thanks paned) but to reload you have to quit the mission and then reload from the mission select screen. Some of these routes are very long and take quite a time to load. You only get one save slot per mission and so even doing a reload may not save you if you are about to pass a red signal. Get it right and there is a sense of achievement ( or relief ) but the bugs just get in the way.\n\nThere are other computer controlled trains on the line and you can be perfectly on time, top scoring only to have one of these crash miles away from you for the mission to fail. You did nothing wrong, the game bugged. remember how long some of those missions are? Imagine that happening 45 mins into one. It will.\n\nYou might like to purchase some of the nice shiny DLC, in a word don't. There is zero, zilch, nada, zip, guarantee that an update won't break it without warning, and never be fixed. When I first wrote this review in Dec 2014 the Isle of Wight career scenarios were totally bugged and would not load and had not since the 2014 update. Well at this has at last been sorted along with over 100 other bugs and glitches for one, rather old, route. OK congrats for at last sorting the problems devs, but you have released countless new bits of DLC in the meantime many of which have their own bugs.\n\nOne of my 3rd party routes (can't remember which) has you so that you are embedded in the roof of the train cab making driving 'interesting'. That broke in 2012. Since the original review I have found that some of the wooden post semaphore signals from the UK set have the signal arm at the bottom of the post (so embedded inm the ground), rather than where it should be at the top. I have no idea how long these have been broken, but given the devs priories (new DLC, new DLC etc) don't expect these to be fixed soon if ever.\n\nBuilding\n\nHanker after your old train set, want to build a virtual one? Look elsewhere or the bugs and frustration will get you here as well.\n\nThe editor is complicated, and you have to do a lot of background reading before you start. Signals are complex things and getting them wrong with cause you no end of problems. This would not be a problem if editor loaded and didn't crash, and allowed you to move a track without sicking buffers all the way along it and has a sane way to build tunnels and didn't crash if you raised a track for a hill and... In short it's bugged as well. As for the documentation welll....\n\nTo sum up its a nice idea ruined. The graphics are nice (and bugged - check fully leaved trees that cast the shadows of bare branches, solid walls that have light flooding under their bases etc), and it could be a relaxing way to spend a few hours.\n\nIf it worked.","December 1, 2014","false","054.2"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","22","31","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bootyprotector/recommended/24010/","bootyprotector","Cockblockatiel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bootyprotector/","147 products in account","Giving Train Simulator 2014 the thumbs down is a difficult decision, but I'll explain why I feel I am compelled to do so.\n\nI first purchased TS2014 when it was TS2013 / Railworks 3. TS2014 is essentially an updated version of last year's game with a new menu interface and some minor patches. The same routes available prior to the conversion are compatible with the current version.\n\nFirst, I'll evaluate TS2014 as a game. Graphically, it is probably one of the best looking simulators in the genre, and while the visuals are not cutting edge by any sort, they adequately represent the locomotives, rolling stock, and scenery. Some locations and trains are impeccably detailed and create wonderful scenic panoramas; others are nothing special, but still pleasing, while some models and locales are devoid of details, incomplete, or just plain ugly. Some graphical bugs present themselves, usually missing or clipping textures, but this is largely dependent on the route or locomotive. Certain assets are far more polished than others. Sounds are overall nothing spectacular. They work for the most part, and some locomotives are equipped with awesome sound packs, replete with CB radio voiceovers, the hum of the engines, and great horns and bells. Unfortunately, other trains were not given the same treatment, and sounding the horn is an anticlimactic experience when the sound is muffled or lacks an echo, and instead cuts off the second the key is depressed. Much like visual detail, quality varies with sound and is dependent on the developer of a given asset.\n\nGameplay is fairly standard for a train simulator; there are no interesting new features or design quirks, and let's be honest, I didn't expect there to be. The standard by which simulators are judged the most is realism, and by and large TS2014 provides a fairly realistic experience. Steam locomotives, as expected, scale in difficulty compared to their diesel and electric counterparts. You are expected to obey signalling and dispatcher orders and are penalized harshly for failing to heed these warnings. Points are awarded for timeliness and subtracted for recklessness and tardiness. There is enough challenge in most scenarios to keep you on your toes; of course, you can free drive, disable all the realism settings, and run the game like MLG PRO EXTREME TRAINZ SIM 420 and surf on rails if you wish.\n\nWith all being said, Train Simulator 2014 is a decent game. It looks nice and will engage players who are interested in railroading and simulators in general. However, it is a terrible value, and I hope to illustrate why.\n\nIn the Standard Edition, which retails for 39.99 USD, you get the game itself plus three routes (the specific routes have changed since when I purchased the game). These routes range anywhere from a few dozen km (15-20 miles or so) to 300+ km (180+ miles) and provide usually no more than 3 trainsets (some are generous enough to give you 4 or 5) along with anywhere from 5 to 12 scenarios, on average. You're paying a bit over 13 dollars per route in addition to the base game. Fair enough. Where Dovetail Games (formerly RailSimulator.com Ltd.) will suck you dry is through the numerous DLC available for the game, and I would consider Dovetail one of the, if not the absolute worst offenders on Steam in the practice of pumping out overpriced and underwhelming DLC.\n\nConsider that the typical price of a new route add-on is 39.99 USD. I bought the base game and three routes for that same price. What justifies a ludicrous markup of over 200% on additional routes, when some are smaller or less detailed than those included with the game? Moving on to locomotives, you can purchase the Amtrak California Zephyr F40PH (a common diesel found on North American railroads) for 19.99. It comes with one livery and a few missions for a DLC that, thankfully, is now included in the base game, but at one time was a separate purchase. Even more pathetic is the attempt to sell the BR Class J74 tank engine for 7.99 with a few scenarios. But the most egregious example of how bad TS2014's DLCs can get is the listing on Railsimulator.com for a silver livery for the PRR GG1 locomotive for 4.99. Yes, for 5 dollars, you can be the proud owner of one skin. Locomotive not included. This is absurd.\n\nI understand that a lot of content in this game is developed by third parties, and that they need to be paid for their hard work. Yet the price gouging set in place by Dovetail can hardly be justified, especially when the developer's quality control team has a history of overlooking minor and not-so-minor bugs in the DLC they allow to be published, resulting in a wide variation in the quality of the addons. Do they want their game to have a reputation for uncertainty? The exhorbitant prices combined with the developer's curt attitude to criticism by the fanbase drives potential players away and hurts the rating of what otherwise is a decent simulation. The Steam Workshop and the intensely devoted railfan community have the potential to improve this game by leaps and bounds if the developers understood that mod friendliness and accessibility can only help their product.\n\nIf you are a railfan and value your money, just go and build a model railway. You will meet more people, gain more useful skills, and enjoy the experience much more than if you buy this game and the accompanying DLC. After all, the cost of all the DLC combined could finance a fairly large-sized model railroad. Besides, you will have more creativity at your hands and create more lifelong memories with that than by investing that money into Train Simulator 2014.","July 6, 2014","false","38.5"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","2"

I sadly must disagree. I bought this game thinking it would be cool. But apparently, all I purchased was a “demo” with a cool background. Over half the missions require maps that you don’t even have. And these DLC maps aren’t cheap. Each of these DLC maps cost $20+. It’s basically just a demo. You don’t even have half of the necessary content to play this game as if it’s the real thing. I was very disappointed. Once you get in the game, you see a store with a very cool background. So basically all you purchased for $60 is a demo with a few maps and a DLC map store (don’t forget the very cool background), so that you can spend more money. If you really like trains, go ahead and buy some of the DLC. But I recommend staying away from this game. To “upgrade” your game to the full version, you would need to buy all of the DLC to make the game fully functional. This could cost up to $1000. The gameplay is very nice, but there isn’t much to do at all without the DLC. I have some of the DLC content but it doesn’t make much of a difference if you don’t buy all of the necessary DLC. I hope that there are better train simulators, or that this one will make all the DLC free. If the DLC came with the game, this would be a very good train simulator. Until they make it free, I’ll be watching that very cool background.","July 22, 2014","false","2.7"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

But this is one of them.\n\nFor whatever reason, the developers of Railworks Train Simulator changes things that doesn't need changing, adds things that doesn't need to be added, and yet, doesn't fix what needs to be fixed.\n\nIn my opinion, this game is not worth buying. When i first got onto this game, it was the 2012 edition, with the 2013 edition being better in a few ways, but this 2014 edition is awful. There is a career system with icons and graphics that look like they were quickly made in MS-Paint, nothing has improved as far as i can tell, and old routers/scenarios are still bugged. For the casual player who wants to have fun driving a train, i honestly wouldn't recommend this at all. It's frustrating trying to get a good score, when suddenly with no warning the speed limit changes, which seems to happen on alot of routes. Saving and returning to the game isn't fun when the load times are this long.\n\nAnd for whatever reason; i have performance problems.\nMy game runs on a AMD Radeon 7970 GHz edition, FX-6300 OC'd, and is on a Corsair SSD, but, when i drive a train at a high speed the map sort of loads in "chunks", meaning every 20 secounds there's a slowdown in FPS. What the hell?!\n\nEvery now and then i fire up this game, feeling like driving a train, enjoying the view (which the new limited camera view has ruined, but whatever). However, i am met with bugs, anger, and frustration.\n\nThis could have been a great, realistic game, with the look and feel of the real thing, but the graphics havn't gotten much better since the 2012 edition, the only additions has been casual features such as controller support and career-mode. The terrain feels dead and people still look ugly.\n\ni do not regret the day i purchased this game, however, i do regret having ever purchased any dlc once this game hit 2013 edition. It is a giant, giant mess of a game, with so much DLC it has gotten out of control, not because there's too much to chose from, but because none of it gets fixed.","January 12, 2014","false","128.0"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","1"

But if you want a game that is strangely absorbing and relaxing at the same time, requiring almost no skill to enjoy but weeks of practice to really be an expert, TS ticks all the boxes. I can see why the shoot-em-up fans don't 'get' this game, but I really do. You struggle to get up a hill with a thousand tons of freight behind you, then worry about running away down the other side. Or you have to pick up on time at every station, stopping literally within a couple of feet of the marker on the platform. Or drive along a country route enjoying the scenery and watching out for interesting trains coming the other way.\n\nIt's pretty much the only Steam game I play, it's got so much extendability - driving a freight train in the snow is VERY different to driving the same tracks with an express train at night in the rain. It not only makes me respect train engineers/drivers much more, it provides me with a lot of pretty harmless fun. Oh, and unlike so many games, it's one that I'm perfectly happy to let my son play.

This game has great graphics, good trains, and tracks. But everything comes in DLC. After purchasing a $55 game it seems it is too overpriced for the content that is delivered with it. I have bought DLC on the latest Steam sale and it came with one train which has a specific map to drive in career mode. Is it wrong to feel swindled out of my money because now it wants me to purchase the 2 $20 maps. If I had known this I would have spent the money on something else or had saved it. This game feel they did the 3 levels and made the 4 different trains and put it out there partly done. I just wish that they had done more and added more to the game. Summary- I wouldn't recommend this game because it doesn't have enough content to be priced that high.

For me, that's about where the positives ended.  I like a variety of games and don't need constant action but this was tedious.  I especially enjoyed when I arrive at stations and had to sit and wait for 3-5 minutes (real time) to elapse to leave the station on time.  The controls for the trains I have require me to have to either constantly hold the throttle or keep losing speed then have to shift back down to not lose points for speeding.  I guess the people who made the real trains these are modeled after never found a way to have linear controls that would stay in place so instead you have 25, 50,75 and 100% power or you hold the throttle in place at a mid point for 3-10 minutes as you travel.  Don't read the speed limit signs or follow their map or you will lose points for speeding when you hit the occasional bug in the game where the programing doesn't match the visual cues.

It suffers from lots of bugs - huge ones in a simulator like wrong acceleration values of a simulated train resulting in rocket train behaviour or plain wrong diesel tank volume because the devs messed up the liters-gallons-conversion to smaller ones like switches being flipped upside down etc - and super low quality assets like textures with a 90s look an resoution and bad modelling like a round switch not beeing round but an octagon. Also the developer rarely EVER updates the simulated stock so when a DLC has a bug it will stay that way. Another HUGE issue is the sound department as most sound assets are laughably bad. Like heavy freight wagons often having no sound at all. Seeing them glide by like hover cars will make you cry and laugh at the same time.\n\nOn the other hand DLC from thrid parties (like Reppos GP20, like the Constallation from Smokebox, like the Class 90 from Armstrong Powerhouse, ...) is brilliant with proper sound, proper realism and proper attention to detail and good quality assets. Driving one of those on a nice route (Stevens Pass for example) that is a labor of love from a third party developer and not the usual rushed and buggy junk is incredibly fun.\n\nOverall I cannot reccomend this game. While there are combinations that shine (Smokebox Constellation over Marias Pass or Class 90 along the West Coast Main Line from Keith Ross or the Meshtools Jinty on the Western Lines of Scotland), the majority of content ist ... sadly though ... junk. Badly buggy with worse sound and low quality textures and modelling. While you will get a nice collection of worthy content you will also collect a huge amount of content straight of RSCs trashbin.\n\nAnd it's not even about the price of DLC as ther is quite some DLC that is worth the full price like the already mentioned stuff and other 3rd party content. It's the attitude with which RSC treats you and this sim. They don't give a damn, they release buggy DLC over and over and over again. They are not interested in improving. They are not listening or updating their own stuff, they just want to sell you new stuff.\n\nWhile the core might be a nice but badly aging platform for third party developers that actually care, the affiliation with the main developer RSC poisons this whole sim. So one can only reccomend to stay far far away.","December 31, 2013","false","55.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NumberNoid/recommended/24010/","NumberNoid","NumberNoid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NumberNoid/","152 products in account","Its a quite fun game if you dont feel like doing anything but there are simply not enough routes incuded with the standard package (which I bought) or with the Steam edition. For this reason (and the ones stated below) I can't reccomend the game. If you really want to buy the game, wait till its on sale. Plus the over £2,000 of DLC is just insane.\n\nThere are many reviews saying that the game has bugs, and it has many of them; engine + break sounds on DB Ice train sound seriously unrealistic (they're not smooth, they go in incriments), the Hamburg to Hannover route ends abruptly, the thing that shows if you're going to tip goes from middle to side really fast if you go past the orange zone and the people walk  incrediby unrealistically, or are just seriously hungover and have serious knee problems.\n\ntd;lr of below: This game doesnt feel like a simulator or like you're driving a heavy train, is missing tons of features, is really buggy and feels more like an arcade game.\n\nThere are many other problems such as not most of the inside of the train isnt controllable which dissapoints me (I like pressing random buttons and watching the warning screens go mental), the route builder is just unintuitive, menu's are complicated, there is no loading menu procentage (however this is minor compared to the rest of the problems), no weather effects when out of cabin view, train textures go really bad once you go out of the cabin view, animation glitches (one of them is the blinds on the DB train merge through the roof) and world textures sometimes are awkward because they dont graduate from other ones.\n\nI also feel that the physics engine is not there, the speed settings seem to have max speeds they can go (no engine torque simulation from my experience), the derailment looks awkward. It quite simply doesnt feel like you're driving a heavy train (brakes are instant and its really quick to throttle up).\n\nThe point system is a good idea but too mean (I mean, speeds randomly changing from 60>40>60 and you're getting penalised for the sudden, unshown change) and the drive quality penalty makes no sense as it doesnt feel like you're going too harshly around the corners.\n\nThe world doesnt seem too real either; the sounds are off. When I'm in a city I expect to hear cars, when I'm in the countryside I expect to hear birds and wind blowing and its just not there. On the subject of weather, the droplets (even though done nicely with the dropping animation) are square and seem to ignore wind and the "smearing" effect of the wind and nothing looks wet.\n\nOverall out of the 14h played it was fun to the extent of pressing the A and D keys and occasionally the Q key when the British highspeed train (class 395) starts beeping like something's about to blow up. If you're looking for a game which feels "arcadey" and not doing much this is the game for you.\n\nEdit 1: Corrected some grammar/spelling errors.","January 6, 2014","false","23.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","2"

After ~20 hours, I'm done with it.\n- Technical difficulty galore... occasionally patches will break the game and leave it unplayable for months on end.\n- Very little to no developer/community relationship and communication\n\nGOOD BUY?\nI regret buying this game even at the sale price at the time.  If you absolutely love trains, I would still wait for a deep deep sale.\n\nRECOMMENDATION SUMMARY\nI can't recommend because the cons outweigh the pros by a fairly large margin.  The core of the game is great fun, but where the idea is nice, the execution and details completely fall through.  Adding salt to the wound:  terrible community relations, technical support (most of my emails/tweets/communication went completely unanswered - still have pending support request unresolved from a half year ago).  Even though the game has its fun moments, it's fraught with holes, and is not good value.","December 20, 2013","false","24.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

First the controls for the game are extremely glitchy! To move throttles and pull switches is a pain because the game is always freaking out with what it thinks you want to do. Just a simple pull of a brake is difficult to preform, what should have been just a simple "move your mouse up or down" was actually a strange left to right circular motion which is extremely sensitive and frustrating to use. Second, don't be fooled by the fancy trailers or cool screen shots, the graphics in this game are absolute garbage! You could say, "but isn't it about the gameplay not the game?" When the Title of your game is "TRAIN SIMULATOR 2015" and your game looks more like "TRAIN SIMULATOR 1999" there's something wrong! Not to mention that the gameplay is suppose to be a cool experience of driving a REAL LOCOMOTIVE, this should be a good looking system with at least great looking trains and with decent looking control rooms. I don't care if the outside looked like an 8-bit atari game as long as the vehicle, which i paid for to drive looks good and drives even better. Another negative is sound design. The opening credit sequence show live shots of trains at work steaming along, honking, whistling, and so on; but in the actual game, none of the sound feels real. All they had to do was get ahold of some recording from a train yard or something, but all the sounds in the game are cheap sound bites. I just had a terribly bad experience with this game and I shouldn't have had to have a bad experience for the price of this game. If Steam allowed returns, I'd returns this game without a second thought! Don't buy this game, there is no simulation in this simulation.

But since the update to Train Simulator 2013 and now TS - 2014, the playstyle has been dumbed down to a point where I feel using the word "simulator" in the same paragraph should be considered a felony! The physics would be comical if the title didn't try to present itself as being "realistic." Unfortunately I find myself describing them as "WTF?" A single sd40-2 puling a 70 car coal drag up a 5% grade at 40mph with no hesitation or stalling? While at the same time a 4-8-8-4 Big Boy struggles with 40 boxcars on level terrain? Riiiiggghhhtt!!! The sounds for most locomotives, expecially North American models are completely inaccurate, although this may be nitpicking considering there are way worse problems such as over-simplified train controls and buggy scenarios. Long heavy freight trains are also ridiculously quiet, not the thundering beasts that we generally associate them to be. Developer attention was spent on rain and snow effects on the windshields and making the cab rock back and forth instead of making sure it behaved and operated like, you know, a TRAIN!! The one thing this "simulator" does do right is graphics. For the most part it is very visually appealing and overall a "pretty" game. But for people looking for a serious railroad "simulator" consider looking elswhere.

Final installation,about 8GB. Then I launch the game. This is the game with the longest load in the history of gaming,so be prepared for that. In the game you're gonna see a list of scenarios, but fear not...clicking to complete most of them will pop up a window asking you to buy stuff.Like the route,the train,etc.Turns out very very few content actually comes with this game (about 3 routes and 8ish locomotives).Rest is paid DLC, with price tags of about £20+.Being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off beyond belief I tried to get rid of it. Returning the game however is not an option.Steam doesn't reply to e-mails, they don't offer refunds for physical items not from Valve Store,and the shop I got it from won't take it back as well,seeing I already opened it. So my advice to you: STAY AWAY from this.It is a blatant rip-off, overpriced with essentially no content, that performs bad and messes with hardware.A very bad venture between Railworks and Steam with no way to get a refund,which also I think it might be illegal.

The game itself is enjoyable, controlling the speeds, directions, hooking up cars, switching tracks, etc. It really is enjoyable. I bought the Holiday Express pack during the sale for only $3.00. Well worth three dollars. I'm glad I didn't pay the full twenty. There were only a handful of scenarios which took no time to complete. Plus, being the Holiday pack, I only got the Holiday train, despite Steam now insisting I own the full version. Here's the first problem.\n\nTo have anything else to do, I have to be willing to spend $20 to $30 to unlock more trains and locations. If they are as basic as the Holiday set, total ripoff. And since the total to purchase all of the DLC is over $3000, I can pretty much guess the small amount of content in each pack. Shame too.\n\nIf this game would include a more broad scope and not be so limiting in the initial purchase, I could see playing this for quite some time. Unfortunately, there really isn't enough to do. And if you are thinking "Workshop mods", forget it. Most of them require a DLC pack of some sort, especially seeing as how I somehow don't have access to the default sets, despite Steam's insistance that I own the base game.\n\nEDIT: I was able to acquire the full version from a 3rd party for only $20. It added a few more engines and three routes. While fun, the only real claim to any sort of "time investment" is that each of the scenarios take anywhere between 45 minutes to over two hours to complete. There still really isn't a whole lot of diversity without paying for each individual DLC. It came with an 80% coupon for a select number of DLC, so I will probably pick one to buy for only a few dollars.. Beyond that, I can't ever see justifying the asking price of the DLC.","December 5, 2013","false","12.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

So many times I've bumped into a "mistake" that undid 15 minutes or more gameplay. Even a successfully completed scenario can result as unsuccessful. Where gameplay should be intuitive and rewarding after 4 hours, by poor design the experience leaves you in the dark and frustrated even 8 hours in.\n\nWhile I have enjoyed this sometimes relaxing game, it's too rough around the edges to be consistently enjoyable enough for me to be happy with it overall. The learning curve isn't worth the needlessly difficult climb to figure out what you need to do unaided, just so you can sit at a station for several minutes waiting for a red light to turn green and wonder what the next problem will be.

This is why Ladies and Gentlemen Dovetail Games have these high DLC prices and this why the game haven't significantly changed from day 1 all those years back, DTG have grown to comfortable with this routine of pumping out medicore DLC at these high prices as its the only thing they can do to just keep them in busniess, if they had more players playing the game daily like Euro Truck has DLC wouldn't be that expensive. DTG need to get the next train sim right, they need to listen to the players for once (not saying they dont) but the whole model of the game needs to change from where it is now!\nWell time for me to contribute my review for Train Simulator as a whole franchise.\n\nFirst even though I do recommend the game it isn't the perfect simulator everyone expects however.\n\nLets go over the positives about this game to not sound to anti Train Sim:\nPROS:\n- This game overall is very good and solid for a Train Simulator; it does all the basics you would want from a simulator; get in train different trains on different routes (all covered)\n- Graphics are genrally pretty good (but I will elobrate a bit more in the cons)\n- It is now a very user friendly game and new comers will find it extremely easy and fullfilling to get into the game and start driving\n- The Steam workshop intergration is one of my biggest pros for this game (it in some ways saved the game from being forgotten about) you have access to free community made scenarios which are far better then ones Dovetail Gmaes try and make with each DLC route, there is always someone you can find on the steam workshop\n- It is sort of immersive I guess....\n- For the DLC collection they have to offer it isn't that bad but more can be done (I will talk about pricing in the cons)\n\nand well.... thats all I can really think of for the pros currently, it a solid simulation that is great for new players to get into ...\n\nBut I am not a new player so for long lasting players maybe some of the pros I mentioned are relateble.\n\nNow the CONS (sit tight)\n\n- DLC pricing.... This is a whole topic for itself: Since the beginning of Train Simulator DLC weren't the cheapest but were reasonable, in the present day I personally think DLC is way overpriced for what you do get. The standard game has also increased so more money to spend if you are getting into Train Sim.\nDovetail games has increased as a company and has a much larger player base then it once had, I do not understand why that should mean to increase DLC price it is obsurd! A route generally costs £25 with any additional trains (that they do not bother to add with the standard route) adding on another £11 to £15.............. this is just way too much money to keep investing into, the most smartest/desperat time for players to get DLC is during steam sales (imagine if they didn't exist?)\n\n- DLC Routes & Trains: Adding on from the pricing point of view.... Routes and train have come a long way through the history in Train Simulator no one can deny that detail has gotten better over the years. But I do not think it is good enough, routes to me do not feel very unique most assests are copied over from other routes e.g. most station exteriors and interiors are just plain simple and copied, they only add sometimes big nice fancy details to show of a particular place in one area of the route. Trains are even more disgusting to think about sure again things have improved but not enough (WHY DO WE HAVE 3RD PARTY WEBSITES like Armstong Powerhouse [which they do a fabulous job] having to step in to fill the gaps dovetail games miss out?) The Class 321 is probabaly the best exmaple of this the one dovetail game released was a total shambles, and then AP released their version with better visuals and sound (especially), it makes you wonder why can't dovetail games include these more improved features? We pay large prices for them? And then you have AP who does a better job for the fraction of the price......\n\n- GRAPHICS ENGINE: Ok this is proabably my most passionate point and I know that TS 2016 is the year where an upgrade to Unreal Engine 4 is due but let me elaborate my concerns for the past few years with this current engine we have!\nThe graphics engine is just too old now. This game have been out for 6+ years and we have been faced with the same PhysX engine and frankly its showing it age! When I said the game is quite detailed I ment only to a point, of course is massively better then an 8-bit game but in the present day with many advancing graphic engines and great game looking games being produced you would think something like a simulation game as one as popular as Train Simulator can have the same treatment. The current engine prevents dovetail games from making far larger maps (which is something many complain about), high 0fidelity of textures is something that cannot be achieved in the current engine; certain assets and textures currently look so terrible and can be compared to a game of ten years ago, Dovetail games only focus on certains things to catch your eye from the reality of the surrounding game!\nMULTIPLAYER: This actually links to the graphics engine issue, the current engine apparently wouldn't be able to handle lets say "a open world multiplayer" which I think is so needed in a popular simulator like Train Sim (I have talked in my youtube video about the lack of connecting the community and friends together with this game, it discourages a connection between player and the achievement system in the game now is just such a bad attempt of dong something to make it look like your friends are involved with your gaming experience. Any the whole multiplayer issue is much deeper than this so I won't carry out but you get the point.\nANNIMATIONS: Again to the with the engine, dovetail games promised better passenger animations in TS 2015 but I think thats a total lie, nothing has really changed and they kind of lied when they released a post about the new features only turning out to only be implemented with the 3 routes thats come with TS 2015, so thats a bit cruel. Many bugs and glitches are still present within the game and its quite shocking that they haven't fixed them for how long the game has been out.\n\nThat raps up my opinions of TS as a whole, I will edited this review if anything else come to mind.\n\nI do recommend this game if you are someone new and wants to get into a Train Sim but beware of the over priced DLC's you will get into (wait for sales if you are tight with money), and people like me who are long serving players and who want change within game franchise we shall wait till next year for TS 2016 where will see the pinicle moment for TS if dovetail games bring it to the table of completely collapse on their face. (DLC for nexts years game is also something very controversial....)\n\nThanks for reading my review! I am QwertyAfro (Sam) I bid you good day!","October 13, 2014","false","481.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","7"

There are plenty of other reviews that go into detail. This is one of those cases where it seems like the dev team all went into different rooms to make the game, then when they were done, they just pasted it all together without refining it very much. All they've done for updates since 2012 is just small optimizations and UI improvements. There are a lot of things that Microsoft Train Simulator 2001 did so much better. That just shouldn't be the case. It's slowly creeping towards being the game it should be. Maybe it'll get there, maybe it won't.

According to Fraps, it runs at 7 FPS on my computer, which is able to do much more complex games just fine - including Titanfall. When another train appears in the screen, FPS drops even further.

"would i personally play and enjoy this?" "would this be easy for everyone? or just me?"\n\nPS: i dont mean for this to sound negative. i genuinely do want this game to get better. but if they keep going their same path, it never will and itll just get worse and worse.","February 28, 2015","false","33.1"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","17","25","0","2"

I dont like a simulator that is so real it feals like work when you use it. Also I am not now nor have I ever worked on a railroad. I enjoy ts because its just real enough for you to get an idea about how trains work but not so real you could go out, hop in a train and drive it away. The realism level of this program is on the same level of farming simulator. If you are Mr. Ultrarealsimulation Do NOT get this. You will be disappointed. If you are a railfan who enjoys casual train operation you will probably enjoy this. With that said, if you are the casual railfan, The DLC is mind blowingly expensive. You cannot even begin to comprehend how much money you could spend purchasing enough DLC to make this more enjoyable. If you think you  will get the vanilla version and call it good, you are mistaken. The standard version comes with three routes and only a handful of locomotives and no steam engines at all. If you want any more routes or locomotives get your wallet out and dont bother putting it away. Even if you want any of the free crap avaliable at the steam marketplace you will first need to have the necessary DLC and that will cost you dearly. If you are new to the franchise, there is a pretty steep learning curve. It doesnt help that the ingame tutorials suck as well. Support? What Support? I have not had one good experiance with the support team. All I got from the support team was a standard response and no fix to my problem. I emailed them back a second time and they essentially told me, Too bad for you, we wont be fixing anything any time soon.\nEven with all the issues, I still very much like the game and I do not regret getting it. I wish there were fewer problems with it and I wish it was cheaper to get the DLC. But like they say Deficate in one hand wish in the other see which one gets filled first. That is why I cannot recommend this. There is no intent on fixing known issues and bugs. I am willing to overlook these bugs, but, unless you really like trains, there are too many problems and the staff doesn't care about these problems. On top of all that, the thing is stupidly expensive. You would think for such an expensive product, there would be fewer bugs but that is not the case. Its a shame though because this title has so much potential.\n\n\nEDIT: 10/14\nGot the new update. I now use TS 2015. What the folks at TS did to update the simulator was to make my PAID FOR content vanish like a fart in the wind. DO NOT BUY.

It even has FATAL FLAWS! This makes the game WORST!\n\nHere are the examples.\n\n\n1. Overpriced DLC\n\nThe most expensive price for route DLC is $39.99. The most expensive loco DLC is $29.99. I could by a game cheaper than it's most expensive DLC. The most expensive route DLC shoud be only $15.00. The most expensive loco DLC should be $6.50.\n\n2. DLC System\n\nAlso on the Holiday Express it says go 100 MPH but the speed sign says 25,30,45 when the 100 MPH limit does not go away. And they care more about DLC then bugs.\n\n3. Impossible To Do\n\nLets say I want to make a custom loco. I have to use RW_Tools. There is no loco editor in the game or the Railworks folder. Plus RW_Tools cost money. If I want to use any wagon or locos in the quick drive train creator, It only lets me do certain locos and wagons.\n\n4. Bugs\n\nThe game will create dump files randomly. Not just my computer but a gaming computer has these problems as well. I played this game on a gaming computer before and it still creates dump files. My Isle Of Wight DLC has some bugs. When I play on of the scenarios the scenario crashes.\n\n5. Unpredictable\n\nLet's say I want to drive a train. Sometimes wheel slips happens unexpectedly while i'm driving a train.\n\n6. Requires gaming computer.\n\nI don't have a gaming computer, here is my computer hardware information.\n\nIntel(R) Pentium(R) CPU B950 @ 2.10GHz 2 Core\n\n4GB RAM\n\n7.Worst Then EA\n\nI did not think there could be a company worst then EA. Well there is, it's name is dovetail, they created railworks and we all know how bad it is. Some of us.\n\n8. A message to the game developers\n\nI just want to say this "Why are you making people not want to play this game." With your overpriced DLC and lack of bug fixing it is making the people not want to buy TS2014 but would rather buy Trainz, A-Train 8. You need to fix the price of the DLC and fix the bugs on the game. You do not want this game to have more bugs than a beehive LITERALLY! Plus you might want to bring back that Amtrack G-Trax DLC.(Update) Thank you for putting the P42 adoon back on steam. Please fix the game!\n\n9.

I saw it in the summer sale with a bunch of DLC at a great prince thought to myself "great deal here", so i bought it. Now I'm regretting it a little. It has its moments where it's really good, but lots of flaws.\n\nFirst off, the vast amount of DLC is amazing, I can't knock the amount of DLC available i even bought a good few packages in addition to the summer sale stuff i got.\n\nCustomer service "stinks" though! Recently the game just refuses to load. Gets as far as "Dovetail games" splash screen then crashes. I Opened a support ticket thought "oh no problem will get back to me in a day or two....." That was 4, maybe more days ago, still no answer. Still no working game. I uninstalled it, reinstalled it. It Worked got an hour or two out of it. Closed it to go out. Come home started it up doesn't work again. Same Problem.\n\nI agree with a lot of other comments for devs. Stop throwing DLC out or rehashing some existing with different liveries and make patches. There are so many buttons that do not work. Please sort it out! It can't be a simulator if half the stuff doesnt work. Also undocking the HUD would be great as well or at least a lot more customisable layouts. Also answer your support tickets or even at least read them!\n\nGameplay wise its ok, controls are easy to learn etc but still majority of the buttons in the cab don't work. Also reduce the cost of DLC some of it is so overpriced and you only get 1 maybe 2 scenerios out of it.\n\nAlso the driving is a little too perfect.... What happened to keeping drivers alert? No emergency cord pulls, nothing running out onto the tracks, random broken down trains. You know realism day to day things that could happen. The only thing keeping drivers alert is the fact the EWS screams when you go through amber lights.\n\nI would reccomend this, but not with the current level of customer service. That needs drastic improvement.","July 15, 2015","false","30.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mossarelli/recommended/24010/","mossarelli","Mossarelli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mossarelli/","125 products in account","The very first thing you might ask is why a lot of people that gives negative reviews, actually have more than 100 hours invested into the game. This is firstly because of the compulsory upgrade of the game that the developers push, so a lot of people you see with 600 hours when the game released last year, owned the previous version of the game and invested a lot of hours into it before it became TS2014.\n\nThis is not MSTS\nIn regards for myself, I started playing the old Microsoft Train Simulator and invested hundreds of hours into driving the Japanese fast trains and enjoyed that game fully. When Railworks released, I downloaded it through other means and played some of the older routes with the diesel engine on the UK maps which combined with the broken game was kind of boring.\n\nWhen TS2014 released, I actually believed that it was of course the same developers as Railworks, but that the engine was completely new and that the only reason there was so much DLC to download and buy was because of backwards compatibility. Jokes on them for doing such an excellent job marketing the new version of their game and dibs on me for digging through 70 EUR worth of DLCs just to come to a boring conclusion about the game: It is not complete.\n\nIf you start out by buying the steam version of TS2014 with the UK, German and US standard routes, you'll be amazed at the nice graphics and 3D cockpits as well as the scenarios. But when you've beaten all the scenarios on expert mode with golden stars or 990+ XP and you are only 6 hours into the game, you ask yourself why a big sandbox open ended game with unlimited potential, only have 6 scenarios for each route and approximately 3 scenarios per vehicle.\n\nWhere is the content at?\nSo here comes the hook: You are the missing link, you are the missing developer. They expect us to learn how to use the editor (which you can't even exit using the ESC button) and has lots of illogical and unintuitive controls. It is not only frustrating when you have to spend 10s of hours on youtube watching 13 year old German kids explain the editor in broken English (Zumindest nehmen Ihre Zahnspange aus, wenn Sie sprechen.); at the end finding yourself with a perfect scenario where each train goes and leaves in perfect timing. This is where you press the fast forward button, make all the trains move from their starting locations and then press the "Test Scenario" button. What happens when you do this you ask? The scenario will save itself as if the current time stamp was the beginning of the map and you have to remake the whole scenario from the beginning, because the editor automatically saves over your scenario without you having to confirm a save.\n\nSteam Workshop\nBut the Steam Workshop will add the missing link between the missing content and the customer developer. It gives the users the powers to upload their glorious expert scenarios to the cloud and can easily be subscribed to by the click of a button. This is of course if one of the customers get past the initial learning curve of the stupid UI in the editor and after at least 3 hours of testing and time table experiments gets a mission working, he uploads his contribution to a filter based browser that gives us much more content. Out of the 30 subscribed scenarios I've downloaded on the UK London-Faversham high speed route, 2 of them worked, and this is why:\n\nDLC Incompatibility\nSo  you downloaded the DLCs for a route and got all the trains included? Great, that means you can now actually drive the route too. Because without the engines and the carts, the scenarios won't work and you will just get a big blob of a message saying: "Content 123_Cart_Livestock is missing from content". You can then choose to edit the scenario and try to find the cart in question and replace it with a cart you have or just quit back to the menu. Even more interesting does this incompatibility become when you have 20 or more of this missing carts that you don't even know what they are, because some guy with that extra DLC of that Northeast corridor route from TS2012 has and this is how the whole Steam workshop is right now.\nOther games shows you mod and expansion incompatibilities or at least lets you have them downloaded but not use them, but no, TS20XX requires the actual DLC on your computer to enjoy a scenario. So until editors of scenarios knows what DLCs they are using (because there is no way to tell the difference between trains and what DLC they comes from), most of the scenarios you can play are from those people who have the exact same setup as you.\n\nAll the online guides are deleted by the developers in an automatic way\nIt becomes even more frustrating when you go online to find solutions for the bugs you find because according to rumors of many reviewers and people writing in the steam discussion, every time the game is reupdated with a new name, all the threads and discussions in the steam discussion disappears as the "old" game cease to exist and a "new" game gets a new created steam discussion forum. So a lot of information on how to resolve bugs, workarounds in the editor and scenario editor is simply gone from existence on the discussion pages and that had a huge group of experienced veterans of train builders leave the scene completely.\n\nGameplay is unpredictable\nAnd then we have the game elements of course which are completely disturbed. Passing a red signal doesn't give you penalty points, it will abruptly end the game with a nice pop up saying: "You passed a red signal at danger, game over". Great, I understand the level of simulation that goes into a train drivers career for making such a huge mistake, it is one of the reasons many modern railways uses an Automatic Warning System to make sure a train does not go past a red signal without emergency breaks applied. And the only reason you want to try to pass a red signal is for fun of catching up with the train in front of you and watch the red lights of it but the game will not allow you to pass a red signal. So what is the problem?\n\nSteam won't allow me any further notes so here's a link where I further explain my points:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28058839/TS2014Steam.html","May 27, 2014","false","118.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

And, that's honestly where the value is.\n\n+ 2015 version has great UI\n+ Fun to drive trains\n+ Interesting tutorials\n+ lots of workshop content\n+ started with 2013 edition, free upgrade to 2015\n+ some free DLC (known as Classic Routes in the workshop)\n+ career system seems interesting so far\n\n- some tutorials need better explanations (ie: when breaking, explaining what wheel slippage is and why it happens would be nice.. or the right time to start slowing down when a speed limit is changed, etc)\n- even with beefy spec'ed machine I still lagged out in certain areas\n- graphics could be plenty better or at least better polish\n- riddled with bugs\n- insane base price\n- insane DLC prices\n\nMy positive and negative bullet points basically sum it all up. It's a neat game, and there's a lot of great stuff here. But is it worth $60CAD? Heck no, not compared to so many other titles out there. Why is that? Because for AAA prices, I don't want to see "ID Not Found" when trying to create my profile. I don't want to see lag or framerate drops on my high-spec'ed machine every time I pass through a town - and all the other little bugs. This is further worsened by the DLC prices - when they are priced the same as full-version titles, and I can read about how they have the same craftsmanship (aka riddled with bugs), I'm just not going to take the chance at getting burned.\n\nAnd that is disapointing, because I like sinking my teeth in detailed sims; and I'm not afraid of opening my wallet and investing considerable sums into a game to support it... But when the title is riddled with bugs, the content (such as the tutorials) need further ironing out and so on, you cannot justify these prices - no matter how niche-market the title is.\n\nI guess I can conclude this all by saying that in the end, I am enjoying it. A) because I did get the base copy and some DLC for cheap, and B) because my base copy keeps getting updated for free; so it's hard to really feel ripped off. So I am enjoying it - but I'm disappointed because I feel like my replay value is going to be capped until I can get some more DLC for cheap; because I won't be paying their regular price that's for sure.\n\nI wish I could say maybe on the reccomendation... but it has to come down to this: until they drop their base prices for the game and the dlc to something more fitting the quality of the game you're getting right now, my reccomendation has to be no.\n\ntl;dr; Great Steam Sale buy if it's dirt cheap (60-70% off or more I'd say). Game is nice, but buggy. Insane DLC prices will likely hurt replay value.. but I'm still enjoying it (since I did get it cheap ages ago) so far.","March 10, 2015","false","6.1"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

However, what really bothered me the absolute most was the lack of built-in content and the absolutely ridiculously priced DLC (it's like EA was in charge of this). Want to drive a steam? Too bad, $20 (which is what the entire initial game should be priced at for the amount of built-in content). If you want a crapload of built-in content for a good price, go check out Trainz; although its engine is outdated, the next version is due for massive overhaul (sorry if I sound like I'm marketing, just wanting to suggest an alternative to check out).","December 21, 2013","false","0.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Been awhile anyway.  I have enjoyed it, although every year when they update, the experience has tended to deteriorate as apparent inefficiencies and bugs are introduced.   It's fun if you enjoy train simulators and is probably the best on the market from that perspective.\n\nYes, there is a lot of DLC, and yes getting it all would cost a small fortune.  This really hasn't affected me a great deal since it is still far cheaper than the model trains and accessories I collect.  There is absolutel no requirement to buy any DLC to enjoy the game as intended.  DLC is just an expansion, much like a new set of tracks and models is an expansion to a model rail display.\n\nThat said, I do not recommend this game to new players.  As noted, its quality is getting worse.  Support is essentially non-existent.  The community can be toxic.  It's not fun anymore.\n\nWith the release of 2016, I can no longer play any part of the game except the part where you fill out a marketing survey.  Every route is a blackscreen, and the game eventually gives up and crashes.  I am too tired to fight a battle with ignorant techs and seemingly intentionally unhelpful support people so I can do something I should find relaxing.   That's not relaxing; it's infurating, and I am done.\n\nSo, uninstall it is, and I'll consider my experiences an expensive lesson in how not to carry on your train hobby once your model set has become too large for your living space.\n\n","September 17, 2015","false","118.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Why? Because the developers are lack of every aspects of striving for good, because Dovetail probably has no quality management and it's marketing department are made of greedy liars. Let's cut to the chase...\n\n+ Oh, there is a train simulator out there and it looks beautiful\n\n- The game itself isn't optimized a bit. Don't tell me, that this outdated graphic and simulation has so much appetite, that a GTX 750 VGA, a Phenom X2 CPU and 8Gbyte RAM is not enough! On bigger railway stations even with this configuration the FPS drops measurably. To be honest the FPS drops without any input even on high-end desktops and it is probably because of the sloppy programming and the lack of testing and quality inspections. Did I mention loading time? Oh, you can have a dinner but if you are a smoker, one slim cigarette is guarenteed even with the recommended system specs.\n\n- The simulation could be fun until you realize that most of the locos are lack many of the essential controls and most of the switches, buttons are inactive textures serves only for design purposes. Don't tell me that a simple loco has only brakes and throttle, pantograph and headlight switches!\n\n- In many cases the HUD's speed limit signs are not in syncron with the actual railroad tracks vica versa. I don't really use the HUD because it's buggy but if you are driving in career mode with enabled scoring system you are f**ed up, because the game sometimes follows the HUD's speed limitation not the actual railroad signs and again vica versa.\n\n- In most cases PZB is bugged too. PZB (german train control system) is quite hard to master and this game makes it even harder. And by the way sometimes Sifa doesn't work either.\n\n- There are mostly only german, us and british routes available, and it is getting boring. Especially the US routes, those locos are totally inactive ones.\n\n- The greed of the company is unmatched in the game industry. They overprice their DLCs and lie about the features and developements. The whole company is based on low-down marketing. They even delete negative comments from their community forums. What they did with the release of the 2016 edition is the most shameful episode in the history of gaming. They even made a 20 minute youtube video about a new menu which basically is a re-colored one. What an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, really! :-D\n\nYou shouldn't buy this game unless you are a railfan!

(other simulators are mostly glorified model railroad simulators)\n\nIt seems to be derived from the Train Simulator that was sold by Microsoft in 2000.\n\nGood points:\n- various trains, routes and scenarios. High-speed, main line, commuter, freight, electric, steam, diesel, you name it.\n- you get a very good feeling of what driving a real train is like. Accelerating, respecting signals, braking, switching and handling minor incidents to stay on schedule.\n- adequate physics, graphics and sounds. Okay this is not up to par with some bleeding edge fantasy games, but frankly, who cares for that on a train simulator?\n- nice snow, rain, sunset, night, etc\n- realistic signaling on most routes. The software seems to allow a fairly good realism. Not all routes take advantage of that.\n-  The London - High Speed Line has a very nice depicting of the French TVM (cab) signalling.\n\nBad points:\n\n- scenario quality and difficulty are very inconsistent between routes, even within the DTG routes.\n\nFor example the ECML route scenarios are realistic and playable (once you have understood the AWS speed checks at 20 mph on warning signal) with adequate spare time to make up for delays, whereas on the München-Garmish route you have to be at max speed all the time, and it's not always enough to be on time. On the Donner Pass scenario, I still haven't understood how to be on time, considering that being at full throttle the whole time doesn't seem to suffice.\n\nSame for braking distances when you encounter a closed block signal: distances are realistic on the ECML route, whereas you just can't possibly brake fast enough on some closed signals in the scenarios of the München-Garmish route. So you have to redo the scenario from that point, braking before seeing the signal, which kills the whole experience.\n\n- you can only handle careers for 1 person. Too bad for families.\n\n- the save/resume system is primitive and doesn't save the whole cab state, some throttle or brake positions can be lost in the process. You can only save 1 point at a time per scenario. There is no way to find the list of saved games, you have to look for that scenario by scenario.\n\n- the French translation is awfully bad. So unbearable I'm hoping I would be able to revert to the English version, but it doesn't seem possible.\n\n- DLCs are waaay, way, way too expensive. Don't buy them, unless you're dying for a specific route or rolling stock. Only buy them in a pack with the game (such as the Steam Edition series) and/or wait for bargain Steam sales which happen about once a year. That way you get a pretty good value for your money.\n\n- the in-game keyboard help is incomplete.\n\n- the ETA system sometimes gives weird results (ETA in the past...). The documentation gives no detail on what computation it is supposed to show (based on max line speed? Current speed?)\n\n- the track display at the bottom of the screen is aged and buggy on some routes (some speed limits are incorrectly shown). The line speeds & ramps & map, etc should be part of the documentation, or accessible from a menu, like in the real world, not limited to the next 2 miles of track on the bottom-of-screen display.\n\n- documentation is lacking. It does a minimal job of presenting the game, routes, signalling rules and rolling stock. Many things you'll have to learn by trial-and-error (especially on scenarios). It is to be found online, when it exists. Supposedly the game provides direct access to it for the DLCs you have installed, but it doesn't seem to work. Plus, it would be nice if it was made available during play, but isn't.\n\n- can't reuse old MSTS 2000 routes and rolling stock. This is sad as there were tons of free routes in all countries.\n\n- not many routes other than UK/US/DE. See above, MSTS 2000 had tons of these.\n\n- no multi-player / online mode. In 2015. Really sad. Lots of fun to be had.\n\n- being able to play as a signalman would be fun, too (see multiplayer above :)","September 17, 2015","true","45.9"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","20","32","4","0"

The potential is certainly there; in fact, it's not that far from being a good game.

The physics....well, not knowing what driving a steam engine would really feel like I cannot say that it makes me think I am. But despite these deficiencies I find it strangely compelling to drive a commuter train and there is a real sense of achievement when you have kept it to time.\n\nThen, however, comes the frustrating part. The latest annual update made a whole mess of the game; an unwieldy and counter-intuitive menu system, scenarios which now no longer work, graphical glitches galour and achievements which can now no longer, well, be achieved. And a company which basically does not listen to its customer base but prefers to bury its head in the sand.\n\nA new version with a brand new graphics engine is apparently in the pipeline which will then become the flagship.

However, Trainz runs fine on most regular PCs and they don't make you pay ridiculous amounts of money for more routes and content to add to the game. The DLC for this game is expensive for what it is and when you buy the base game you're not given many routes or equipment thus forcing you to buy the proprietary Dovetail DLC from their store or from Steam. The dynamic lighting feature is tied directly to locomotive headlights that actually produce light, so if you turn it off you get the wonderful sensation of driving a train without being able to see what's ahead of you. The game also has ridiculous system requirements in order for it to run properly. The sensitivity of the scenario scoring is also quite ridiculous as well as some of the ways that the in-game physics work.\n\n\nI still play this game because I payed good money for the base game as well as the DLC, but I have mixed feelings playing it as well as paying any more money for their expensive DLC. If anything I find playing the other steam games to be better value for game play than this or even just any of my other hobbies compared to this game.\n\n\nDon't buy this game unless you have a powerful computer and are willing to spend tons of money on actually buying enough content to fully enjoy the game. If anything it'd be better to try and find a different train simulator to play other than this one.","April 19","false","147.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mavadelo/recommended/24010/","mavadelo","Mavadelo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mavadelo/","63 products in account","Train simulator 2016 has been released a few months ago and so it is time to give it a proper review\n\nFirst things first, this review will not be about prices, I can't give a rats ♥♥♥ about the price of either the game or the DLC. This game is mainly sold on Steam as is the official DLC and Steam has enough sales each year that the price of a game or DLC means diddlysquat. You find the prices to high, wait a few weeks and chances are they drop 50 to 80% for a few days. You are never more than 3 months away from a good deal.\n\nThe good\n\nThe current incarnation of Train Simulator is Train Simulator 2016. Personally I think it is one of the best yearly updates I have seen for those that bought the new edition. It has some very nice content coming with it, the new menu look is great, the new search works finally like a search should work and the content I played so far is of the better quality. My personal favorite in this years edition is the Union Pacific Gas Turbine also known as the GTEL. The new DB BR155 is a nice German engine as well and the new Riviera in the fifties route with its 5 Steam engines is one of the better route add ons I have seen in a long time. Ok, Sherman Hill and Cologne to Koblenz are reruns but if you didn't already own them they are two good additions for your collection. the Steam edition also packs the Norfolk Southern Coal District and the SD60M. The last one was added a bit later to the pack but everyone that bought the game got the engine regardless.\n\nAlso good is the TS rewards that are new this year. If you updated/upgraded to TS2016 you got a pop in after first launch where you could sign up for a newsletter which also signed you up for these rewards. Officially the first rewards are for TS2016 related content but the first reward was given to everyone that signed up even if they had the free update and it was a rather nice yellow boxcar. as extra bonus they added a 20% off coupon for the game for those that had not bought the new addition. The boxcar looks nice and imo stands out from the normal rolling stock you see but I couldn't resist making a reskin for it (as well as for the GTEL) and making a bit of fun with the yellow theme it has. You can find the reskins at http://www.wolfdenmedia.nl/download/the-minion-pacific-full/\n\nThe new support system. Not really a TS2016 addition as it is in place for a few months now but my recent dealings with this new system and the people have been... satisfactory. Ok it took you long enough to actually post the correct info on tailsimulator.com and the Steam support topics but I think it is an improvement over the email system you had\n\nThe community:  Simply an amazing bunch of people. You will find them on Steam and on several "fan sites" like railworksamerica, UKTS, Railsim.de and many other country related sites. they are providing the players with first line support, reskins, fixes, mods etc. Do visit the sites, get involved, have fun\n\nThe bad\n\nYes, the bad. Let's start with the fact DTG managed to ruin the update once again especially for those that did the free update. First there was no loading screen which made many players think their game had frozen and/or just didn't work anymore and when a hotfix was released it resulted in people not even being able to start the game at all. This somehow affected the free update only so I think personally that it had something to do with the fact that the new menu is now a DLC pack just like the academy for example. Yes it is part of the game but at the same time it is not. I think it is a wrong move by DTG, you want a new menu look, fine (it looks great) but release it for everyone as part of the core and not as a paid feature. It is ridiculous and doesn't make sense at all\n\nBugs ... it wouldn't be a DTG release if it didn't have at least a few bugs. The new drivers assist function for Steam engines for example does not work like it should. I have tried it and the tips it gives do not make any sense. It resulted several times in me running out of water, it told me to give more on the reverser and followed that up (after you followed the advice)  with less reverser, and more, and less, and so on. It basically made me nuts and ditch the use as quick as I could while having the idea it was at least tried out properly by me to give an opinion on it. Mind you, the driver assist only works (for now) on the new Riviera in the fifties Steam engines. I consider this a work in progress for DTG and it should not have been added yet\n\nRailfan mode....... really DTG? you dare to call that a "new feature" ? ok, I give you that you added an option in the editor to set points along the track for this railfanning but common, this is for the rest just a career scenario without a player train. It can be fun for a few times but a new feature?  maybe you guys should check the workshop and see how many of your talented players have created very nice railfan scenarios without the need of a "railfan" marker. Take with that, that the Sherman Hill, Sherman Hill  railfan scenario is broken, not bugged... broken and I rest my case, what a useless addition that is\n\nThe Ugly\n\nYou thought I was done? HAH no no my friends, there is "the ugly" as well and boy oh boy it is ugly\n\nBigBoy: You decided in your "wisdom" to repack the bigboy (and the challenger) in the Ap file compression format. In itself not a bad idea, it makes for less 'clutter" on your system although reskinners and modders are less thrilled that they have again another ap to unpack thus adding to the size of their installs but.... YOU FORGOT TO PACK THE SOUNDS.... and... you completely miscoded a bin file that has the references to said sound files as well (a fix can be found at http://www.wolfdenmedia.nl/download/big-boy-sounds/ , you are most welcome) Which numskull has been responsible for that? how on earth can you forget a part of the setup of an engine. Worst thing though is the fact that there is still NO OFFICIAL PATCH, excuse me? it took me half a night and I am not even a game developer to get it fixed (again, you are welcome, see the link I posted, grab it, pack it and make the people happy, you are even allowed to take credit if you wish)\n\nBNSF: Do I have to go there? hell yes I have to go there. HOW has it been able to come to this, HOW could you not see this coming. You were ordered by BNSF about a year ago to remove all BNSF content and what do you do? you remove all content that have BNSF in the name, leave the rest in place, don't inform your players of what is happening and think you are done. Then suddenly BNSF comes telling you they ordered you to remove BNSF content all together, you remove WITHOUT AGAIN INFORMING YOUR PLAYERS this content which by the way contains two very important routes. Refuse to replace those routes, refuse to replace the engines that are NOT BNSF in the other removed packs, basically flip the finger to your non US player base and when I take action and rally the community you play the innocent and one of your devs even sends me an angry mail on how I dare to talk about DTG, a certain site and "question his integrity"? Well, actually I didn't question his integrity but your response to me actually proves what I said on "that site". YOU are free to respond if you like although I don't think you will. I will not reveal your name as this is not my style. However my comments remain the same, your company simply has been screwed if not blackmailed in this, Trainz and run8 are proof of this as they clearly show the "official BNSF and DTG response" is a load of bullpoo.\nreview to long, read the whole thing at http://www.wolfdenmedia.nl/howling-down-the-track-a-ts-and-dtg-review/","May 18, 2015","true","208.4"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","24","40","3","3"

Long routes may take longer than 5 mins to load and you can only drive about 5 to 50 miles before on error occurs. Their is not a huge collection of addons which cost over £2000 so far! I bought it in November and so far I have got no where and over the last few weeks i cant even load up the menu before it crashes. Did i mention it has viruses? No? Also their are no instuction for anything at all. Ive been depending on amateurs from google and youtube to get my tutorials no offense. I would of sold it months ago if i haden't bought any DLC addons. Did you know the 5 mile route in Isle Of White is £20. This company iss stupid and never listens to your complaining about bugs. Did they say that theirs applications hidden away in the game files which you need to download and change the options to make it work, NOT ME!!! They just make games and never update or fix,but they just expect you to play it?!

( even more than Total war: Rome II)\n\nLets start with DLC, 3000$+ worth! So the base game is 30$ (I believe) and it comes with 3-4 trains and one route, I was lucky  enough to have bought A bundle pack worth 70$ that was on sale for 50% off, wich added 5-6 more trtains and 2 routes, oh joy :( In comparison with Trainz (2006) was 40$ at release and came with 400 trains and 40+ routes, sooo yea.\n\nNow graphics, these graphics are the best in train simulation, but they dont have any "Low" options, so hat I can play it with more than JUST 8 FRICKIN FPS! it is stupid! and my computer specs are pretty high!\n\nGraphics: 5ghz AMD RADEON 5000\nRAM: 8GB\nHARDRIVE: 1TB\n\nso yea.\n\nGameplay\nNow the gameplay is very, VERY, slow. So unlike trainz you dont have to switch points manually and you cant control multiple trains at once. The routes themselves on this game (atleast the ones I have (London, Germany and NY)) are very boring, they a completely flat and straight, so they are pretty much chanlengless. THe physcs are unrealistic and the HUD is AWFUL!\n\n\nSo I would not recomend this AT ALL.\n\nI have scored it this way\n\nDLC FREE: 1/10\nGRAPHICS: 7/10\nGAMEPLAY: 3/10\n\nOver all 11/30\n\nDO NOT BUY IT","November 3, 2014","false","6.3"," 25 of 42 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","25","42","0","0"

The game is very pretty, and the trains look very nice. However, the physics are way off, trains lose speed at an extreme rate as soon as you lay off the throttle, and anyone who's ever driven a train know's that is not what happens. Also, even though most many trains today use electronic break systems that can initiate all breaks simultaneously, all freight trains and also passenger trains that are pulled by locomotives still use air powered break systems. These do NOT react with lightning speed as it does in this game.\n\nThese two issues are to me game breaking and totally pulls me out of the immersion that the game would otherwise have. If the development team could focus on making the actual driving of the trains more realistic, and by extension fun, they could have a great game that I would probably immensly enjoy.

If you want more locomotives rolling stock or a easier route editor go with Trainz 2012","February 8, 2014","false","115.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The graphical fidelity of this game is decent but this is 2014 and using 2D trees which rotate to look 3D in this day and age is pretty awful, overall pretty good however soon enough you will have done everything in the base game... so what next?\n\nWell one thing you have to praise is the workshop which lets you download additional routes, scenarios and some other bits and bobs from other owners of the game which are free, and to be honest if this basic feature was not in the game there is no way I would be so positive up till now, so you have to give credit to all the people who have worked hard and given up their time making free content just to make the game more enjoyable, because the developers are too busy making the next stunningly accurate DLC to sell on the store.\n\nEventually you will want some new routes / locomotives to play around with so you will inevitbale consider paying some hard earned money for some extra DLC which you would assume will be a reasonable price.......... Unfortunately the prices are extortionate and paying £12 just for a locomotive in my oppinion is far too expensive and this is where the game starts to go downhill for me, the DLC is far too expensive and some of the DLC I have taken the plunge on has been very dissapointing. The GEML London - Ipswich Add - On is missing popular stations such as Southend Victoria and Clacton yet I paid £25 near half the price of the game for one route.... for this reason I don't recommend their DLC as you may be surprised to see parts of the route you want are not there!!!\n\n(P.s. the £12 class 90 add-on didn't even have a passanger view??? I am dissapointed by this as other DLCs do have the passanger view, and you don't clearly detail what is / is not included.)\n\nCarrying on, the parts of the route it does include are pretty well done but the platforms on this particular DLC are too short at a majority of stations along the line and whilst I don't expect a 100% replica if your going to take the time to model each station atleast make the platforms the right length? my next issue is that whilst there are very good powerful features to  create / edit routes and scenarios the tools are moderately good but very buggy and will crash often or create errors with little debugging information which is just rediculous and makes these tools somewhat obsolete. I assume this is why the DLC is so expensive?? Not to mention a lack of documentation on how to use these which is a shame, engine-driver is one of many places to find some tutorials however the next part of a tutorial usually never shows up.\n\nTo sum it all up, this game is not a bad game, I have played some awful games and as a rail fanatic this game has done a good job of keeping me satisfied, however DLC pricing is out of touch and extortionate, usually not 100% complete or lacking fearues I would consider mandatory personally, the tools they have added to let the average joe create scenarios and improve routes whilst promising and fairly decent are tarnished by their incompleteness and are sometimes at best rather tempermental and require extreme patience. It is for these very reasons I can't recommend this game and I won't be buying any more DLC unless it is dirt cheap.","July 11, 2014","false","142.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

I purchased TS 2014 Steam edition with Pacific Surf-liner route. At first the tutorial would crash after starting, with only 2gb (Windows 7 32bit, Quad core) of ram I could see the game would use it all and then crash. I upgraded to 4gb of ram and the game worked for awhile, tutorials, scenarios. Pacific Surf-liner will run for about 15 minutes and crash with either a dump message or a vertex message. I have the game running as low as it possibly can but the issue persists. After searching I have found dozens of people like me who have this experience with little to no help given. Solutions are all over the place from 3gb ram switch for windows to reinstalling everything from .net to flash player. Its rare that I feel cheated by a steam game but when 99% of my library works without a crash and this game generates them within 5 minutes I feel like I deserve a refund.\n\nPlease DO NOT ever buy this game or anything made by these people, its a mess that will keep you up nights trying to figure out why the 1 hour long scenario crashes every 15 minutes. I wasted 17+ dollars but you don't have to.\n\nAfterthoughts: After running the game in a window at 1024x768 (previous was 1440x900) it ran on Low detail with very little fuss.

You will be glad you did. This simulator looks good. Ill give it that. But my praise ends there. Once you look at the extremely pricey content, the lack of easily usable scenario creators, and iron fist control, you realize that they should be paying you to use this game. Lets start at the beginning, This simulator is not cheap, $20 for two locomotives and a set of passenger cars, that is absolutely free for trainz users. In fact, a peruse through the store finds that there is no free content besides user made scenarios that use the content that isnt free... you get the point. Its obvious that the creators did not want you building scenarios, because the process is daunting and more frustrating than the videos above make it sound. Mainly because you are unable to use any content not specifically slated for use on that route. For example, you wish to use a P42 and Phase IV superliners (that you paid $20 for) on Donner Pass to model the California Zephyr. Well, those P42's (While completely common on Donner) are only accessible on the $40 Marias Pass route, so you can forget about a Zephyr. Unless of course you wish to fight the scenario creator and go in via quick drive yada yada yada... The point? Dont buy this game. Seriously, dont.","February 23, 2014","false","251.7"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","1"

I think if you give the game a chance and u like trains, it will give you enough hours of fun.\n\nWhat I do not recommend about it and why it gets a thumbs down: The career mode scenarios are punishing mistakes too harshly and quickly.\nMoreover the prices of the DLCs are ridiculous, to say the least. Given the content delivered, paying almost 30 euros for a route and 15 euros for 1 (!) Loco is really a joke. If the devs want to make this game more attractive to people they seriously need to consider dramatically lowering the prices (ever noticed that the total TS experience will cost u almost 3000 euros??). I waited for some packs to be combined or to get on sale, because otherwise you just throw money out the window.\nAlso I think compared to Trainz and MTS the variety of train networks and routes is a joke, too. Britain (of course) is overrepresented, and then you have Germany and some west and east coast US routes. Would be nice to see French, Italian, Dutch and other European country's rail networks & Loco's.\n\nIt's fun, but dont get any high expectations. And dont spend too much money on the DLC's.

You get to, at least to some degree, experience driving a train.  The game has pretty decent realism, in the sense that it knows that as more and more rolling stock are coupled, the train gets heavier, longer to stop, slower to speed up, etc.  But I don't think the good parts outweigh the negatives.  For starters, the prices of the add-ons are outrageous.  And it's a total bait and switch, you buy a route, and ooops, you need to go buy a locomotive.  And you aren't buying quality add-ons either.  I think it's fair to say that between all the add-ons that I have purchased, there are not any 2 that deliver the same quality in terms of programming.  All have some bugs, some many bugs.  I have experienced bugs pretty much every time I open the game.  The last drive I just played, I was well under speed limit, on a straight track, and the train just all of a sudden derailed.  Of course, I was about 80% done with the 3 hour drive, and naturally the scenario just ended, so lost all that time.  That's what really sucks is you think you got a drive good, and wham, a big flaw hits, and you are looking at game over.  Anyway, for the money they charge for this game, and all the add-ons, they NEED to really invest into a QA department and not just pocket the profits.  This game could really rock if they actually paid more attention to detail.","May 28, 2014","false","532.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The graphism aren't bad and the weather system is just great.\n\nYet despite all those good points I have 3 very negative points :\n\n1 - This game is a resource hog - I can run other simulators like ETS2 full graphism but I can't run this game at the lowest setting without overloading my memory. You will need a 1500Euros computer at least to play this with the minimum requirement, and the graphism aren't that better than the other games.\n\n2 - A lot of issues with the scenarios (missions) preventing them from being successfuly completed. Impossible timetable, wrong reward points setting ( you need a minimum of 900 out of 1000 for the mission to be full success and some mission only gives 700), AI wrongly set preventing you to move. This gives an idea of unfinished work or untested game which saddly  spoils all the fun i could have had. And the fact most aren't fixed after 3 months makes you feel like no one is listening to the customers\n\nand those two points bring me to :\n\n3 - Price : Although I think this game could worth its steep price, the numerous issues presented especially for the scenarios can make you feel ripped off.  The complete game with all extension amounting to over 1000 Euros, one would expect the game to have very little default or at least that the few defects be fixed in reasonable time.\n\nFor myself i will stop paying for new content until the contents I have is fully fixed.  I cannot afford to pay over 3000 Euros (new computer + complete collection) for just a game.\n\nmy advice is wait till this game is fixed before buying it, or at least dont buy anything if its not in at least a 75% sale","February 13, 2014","false","146.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

When a game has Facebook intergration but no ability to rebind controlls you know you're onto a winner. Much less a simulator. In fact so little has changed I'll leave my old review below.\n\nPrevious 2014 review: Why is it that this new version only allows an Xbox controller as an alternative controll device? I have a three lever throttle quadrant whuch would be perfect for this game, yet I cant configure any controlls. Is It really that hard to impliment rebinding of controlls? No it isn't. Call youselves a simulator?\n\nIt's also full of nagging advertisemnts to buy payware addons.

Even though the game graphics looks ok the AI part of the game isn't that good.\n\nI like building routes in this game which can be hard at first which gets easier and then you start finding the bugs game crashes when you do some complecated junctions etc. Then after building your route you decided i know i will run two trains one user controlled and the other AI. After setting up where your AI train is going to go (on a double track railway) your Ai train decides i can pass that point because the user train is in the way but the train is on the other track and another strange bug. Other things like track floating in mid air sounds on some trains are not good i could go on with a list of bugs. Also on common bug where most you would have seen red lights at a railway crossing the cars sometime drive stright through. The one thing i don't like is they never really fixed the game it was just change the name of the simulator and of course change the company name but made no diffrence.\n\nAbove all that some parts of the game is intresting and there is some routes which you have to pay extra round about £25 a route comes with scenery trains. Trains anything from £6 up to £12 The game is good apart really from certain bugs a few years ago yes i would have recommended this game to a friend but there so many new things out now next gen console's and games which is better to spend your money on lots of people would disagree with my comment which is fine but you might enjoy the game or you might not.\n\nUpdate after relase of trs 2015\n\nSince trs2015 has come out well no bugs have been fixed its just a change of name new weather effects and UI change and thats it still the same basic game as 2012 2014 and 2015 nothing has changed.

I bought a boxed copy of TS2013 in 2013 for like $12 on sale, at Target or Wal-Mart, and have spent more than I'd like to admit in DLC overtime. It's been good, but things arent getting better. I do like playing, it just there are a lot of areas that would make it leaps and bounds better. I will Continue to play this game and buy its dlc(on sale) because I do enjoy it and I am a sucker.\n\nAt the time of writing 12-19-2015 I have basicly no access to content that is currently advertised and that comes with ts2016, which I find quite appaling. The only route I do have is Sherman Hill, but It came with my boxed copy. I use the word route intentionally, because thats just I only have the route, not the trains advertised, namely the UP GTEL. which is new and as far as I can tell can only be obtained by buying the Sherman Hill Route, which I already have.\n\nEvery year they "upgrade" my base game. Which has effectivly added nothing to my game. they have changed the UI and Splashscreen every year, with ts2015 I was really happy with the intro video, its got Sean Bean <sidenote>how is that pronounced its it bean or baun?</sidenote> voicing it if you know who he is.\nBut no, with this latest "upgrade" I got some crap video rubbing it into my face all this content I dont get with the base game. Oh and dont expect the graphics to look like that, It's never going to happen.(Since I bought this I have made some improvement to my computer, mainly better graphics card. all of which has made little or no change in the frame rate of this game, which currently runs at about 15-20, with very frequent lag spikes. I have seen massive improvements in graphics and framerates in other games such as Skyrim, Euro Truck Sim2, Kerbal Space Program)\n\nQuite often there is an almost utter lack of attention to detail in everything. For instance in the Locomotives, no two trains are held to the same standard of quality. blurry interiors, horid sound quality, poor lighting effects, near complete lack of interior control many trains have no interior lighting, makes night driving not fun at all. Most have no control over exterior lights I.e. running lights, although on some trains step lighiting, number lights etc. (both of which you really never have control because a complete lack thereof) Effectivly there is three light settings On(FWD), Reversing, which should show red light on the front of the Locomotive, but for all intensive purposes this is an off setting, and then off, no lights anywhere.\nI'd say 80% of the locomotive I have don't have a bell.\nOld content(and customers) get left behind and abandoned in this game. With every "update" there's more bugs, more crashes, and longer loading times. Old content never gets updated, fixed, redone, just left to rust like an old locomotive. Just look at me heretofore mention "Sherman Hill" story.  It seems to me the only people they care about, are people who havent given them money yet.\n\nMy Biggest grip is the Editor I start with the consist(Locomotive and cars) editor, Crashes 75% of the time, if you can get it to load, its not bad.\n<Parental Advisory>\nThe Scenario Editor, holy ♥♥♥♥. Acutually Un-holy ♥♥♥♥, because thats what it is an unholy abomination in the eyes of whom ever you worship. It is so incredibly hard and frustrating to use or even understand. It uses some terrible GUI system that makes no sense and often just doesnt work, unless you do it precisely a certain way with less than a .0001% margin of error. Nothing has label, unless you hover over it for like 5 seconds. I want to know what DTG uses to make the routes, because there is no way in hell that is what they use to pump out their DLC. I lose my sanity and swear profusely at my screen everytime I try to use it.\n</Parental Advisory>\nOh and fyi, the listed system minimums lie.\nI might add more to this later, but I'm just so frustrated right now writing this up, I need to take a break.\nAgain I hope that one day I can redact all this and write a positive review, because of my love for trains and simulator games, I really hope that day comes and soon.","December 19, 2015","false","158.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","8","11","3","0"

Previously, I had played a version of Trainz (maybe 2006'ish?). I do not have the benefit of knowing this product previously or having previous "included" content that may have come with TS 2012 or 2013 or whatever. My review reflects (for all purposes) a brand-new user of Train Simulator.\n\nMy overall feeling towards this product is: Half-♥♥♥♥♥. There are just too many bugs, including impossible scenario timetables, career scenarios that require you to buy even more DLC content, and a marked lack of tutorials. The test track and whatever tutorials came with previous versions of TS is no longer included with TS 2014, so the tutorial only shows a couple of quick ICE 2 (German high speed train) driving tutorials only. There are a handful more tutorials, but they are not listed under tutorials, they are listed under the normal drive scenarios. How difficult would it have been to have tutorials show up under "tutorials?" I don't know, but it's that kind of general carelessness that mars an otherwise visually beautiful product.\n\nI have experienced scenarios with impossible timetables, stuck brakes, stuck signals, and the piece-de-resistance (for me): the Northbound Celle Intermodal Career Scenario (Hamburg to Hanover Rail Line). In that one, you have to wait some 20 minutes (!) at a signal (no, it's not stuck, it's just crappy scenario design), which will totally -- through no fault of your own, mind you -- blow your timetable to shreds. You will finally arrive at your destination some twenty or so minutes late and complete the scenario successfully...except for a teeny-tiny deduction of -17284 EXP (in my case) for tardiness. That's -17284 EXP on a scenartio that probably gives 1000 EXP if you're perfect at it. I've massed a couple of -7000 penalties in previous Donner Pass scenarios (almost all of which have broken timetables, BTW), but this was the first time that a scenario forced me to take a huge penalty so blatantly.\n\nI also don't understand why there is a discrepancy between the career, drive, and free roam scenarios. You'd think that if everything is made up for career, putting that scenario in the drive or free roam section wouldn't be much of an issue, yet entire routes that are in the career scenarios are missing from  the drive scenarios and, in my case, free roam only came with a handful of Donner Pass scenarios. No London Faversham, no Hamburg to Hannover unless I made the scenarios myself, which to the uninitiated such as I looks terribly complicated.\n\nI did purchase an additional rail route: the Pacific Surfliner Los Angeles to San Diego route, because it is my "local" route (I live in Southern California). Now, there is a gorgeous route with playable scenarios and nary a major bug that I could find. Why, oh why, couldn't the rest of what came in the Steam edition be like Pacific Surfliner? That was massively enjoyable.\n\nThis game has so much promise and I will continue to muck around with it (I will even sink more money into it when a couple of routes that peaked my interest go on sale), but I cannot in good conscience otherwise recommend TS2014 in its present state. Unfortunately, from what I gather, Train Simulator has always had these kinds of bugs and apparently no one seems to be fixing them, just too busy producing more DLC, I guess.","January 16, 2014","false","290.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Each year since its release in June  2009  the game has been upgraded for free (so far); it started life as a game called Rail simulator, but was released on Steam with a name change to Railworks and later became Train Simulator.     If you're a train enthusiast, you'll want to expand the  game  by adding  more dlc; I highly recommend you wait until sales are on to get  most dlc for at least 50% off  or more.  You don't need every dlc to enjoy this game.  It would cost an absolute fortune if you were to buy all or most of the dlc  available, even  when you take account of all the   dlc being on sale; however , to  those of us who enjoy this sort of game, its well worth it.\n\nIt is the best  train simulator  available at this time and has been since its release back in 2009. (I don't know what the original Rail Simulator was like).  If you aren't bothered as much about the graphics then the Trainz series is probably the way to go as you get  loads more rolling stock, engines and   different  area's to explore in the  basic package. plus there's only about 10 dlc  available for the game.    I backed the latest version of Trainz via Kickstarter as I thought they were going to make  a much better looking  game this time, but I was wrong.  Engine cab details are appalling compared to the almost life like cabs you find in Train simulator 2015, plus you can use most of the controls  using your mouse, or touch screen. Also you have two ways you can drive your  trains in Train Simulator, either   using the quick drive controls, or  using the actual  controls in the train.  Trainz as far as I can remember doesn't include that option.\n\nSince this game was added to the workshop, there are  masses of extra content available for free. Not all of it will be usable unless you have the appropriate dlc, but you'll still find loads for  the basic  Steam version of the game.\n\nCheck out a few videos HERE, HERE, HERE, and HERE.

Game is good and have all the features that we can expect from a train sim but developers are charging way more than it deserves. They are selling each DLC at a price of an ordinary game. I have never seen such an aggressive pricing scheme in a game. Before TS 2013, majority of tracks were included in the base game (as done in many Train Sim games) but from TS 2013 they are selling each route as DLC at a hefty price. I also noticed that even during Steam Sales DLC prices do not get much lower as compared to the base game. This is their cheap trick to lure innocent gamers into buying their game. As a game developer your first priority should be your customer's satisfaction but here it looks like their's priority is money. The game which was selling at $50-60 (TS 2012) is now selling at $1500-1700 (including all routes and content).","November 30, 2013","false","11.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If that is not true then the product is being misrepresented however, they are probably using the word RUN in the loosest possible of terms.\nI tried turning everything down to minimum but, it still crashed with depressing regularity.\nThere is a lack of documentation with the game however, it is available, made by the fans fortunately there is a strong fan base that the company in no way deserves a lot of what the developers should be doing is being done by those playing the game.\nMost items in the workshop require you to purchase overpriced DLC's to use them because the base game comes with so little.\nI found problems with things that did not seem to work as one would expect or were missing entirely such as lights, trackside information provided too late to effectively use, commuters as dumb as ducks.\nI could happily ignore all the little things and even inaccurate simulation if the game was as good as it ought to be and indeed could be especially with the available fan base plus, if a second mortgage were not required to purchase DLC's some several years old already, just to make the game more varied challenging and enjoyable to play.\nI was going to spend $25.00-$30.00 on DLC's not a lot to some but, a lot to me now, I shall be spending less on something that works as it should and will not require a constant financial input.\nI don't object to paid DLC's but, a game should not force you to buy highly priced DLC's just to make it playable, especially  as this game is buggy however, I suppose fixing it is not as lucrative as producing another $20.00 DLC.\nThe basic game is the bare minumum possible perhaps not even that, in the countries covered there are enough trains new and vintage and miles of track to provide a bigger and more varied starting package and still allow for almost endless DLC's.\nThe devs claim this pricing strategy is to keep the price down on the base game, I feel it is more give the buyer something so basic they'll eventually spend far more money than they would ever have been initially willing to pay to make it playable, just add up the non-discount cost of the base game and say 4 DLC's you could be well on the way to $100.00 even top games cost less than that and many excellent simulators that also have plentiful DLC's provide far more for less cost in the base game.\n\n\n\n\n","June 27, 2014","false","14.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I suspect most people, like me, buy this game for the beautiful scenery and calm journeys across the country side. And because it's on sale. And then after the download disappointment sets in. The manual, if there is one, is probably in pdf format and tedious to read so the tutorial is the obvious place to start. But what you're not told is that the first tutorial in the list teaches you how to drive forward, but doesn't tell you you're starting on a hill. So it seems as if the controls don't work. So give up on the tutorial and jump right in and what meets you? Sad, low rez graphics as you travel  through what could be a breathtaking view but are met with scenery from MS Flight Simulator 3. "Perhaps Career Mode will be better", you think. Think again. For anywhere from $20 to $40 you have to download an add-on to have a career on. Perhaps the graphics are better on these but since the pics and videos they use to sell the game are way better than what you get I wouldn't blow five times the purchase price of the game to find out.","July 1, 2014","false","11.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

As a result you will have to fork out massive amounts of cash in order to get your moneys worth of the full asking price of $54.99 USD.\n\nThe basic game without any DLC comes as barebones as possible and you will almost definitely be looking at which DLC you fancy within an hour or two, and of course having you to spend much more than the already ridiculous base price of $54.99 USD.\n\nAside from the DLC issue, there are two other blatant problems that have not been addressed by the developer. The first is the unrealistic acceleration and braking, which makes this simulator feel much more like an arcade game. The second issue is that you will be left asking where your money's worth is going with the numerous DLC you will undoubtly purchase since the developers rarely patch or update any routes or locomotives that have bugs. You will see cars driving in the air for example, alongside the road.\n\nSince I've bought over 50 different DLC routes and locomotive packs my copy of the game actually has a decent amount of content, but since I've had to spend tenfold on this game as I have on any other; it is simply impossible to recommend it.

If that is not true then the product is being misrepresented however, they are probably using the word RUN in the loosest possible of terms.\nI tried turning everything down to minimum but, it still crashed with depressing regularity.\nThere is a lack of documentation with the game however, it is available, made by the fans fortunately there is a strong fan base that the company in no way deserves a lot of what the developers should be doing is being done by those playing the game.\nMost items in the workshop require you to purchase overpriced DLC's to use them because the base game comes with so little.\nI found problems with things that did not seem to work as one would expect or were missing entirely such as lights, trackside information provided too late to effectively use, commuters as dumb as ducks.\nI could happily ignore all the little things and even inaccurate simulation if the game was as good as it ought to be and indeed could be especially with the available fan base plus, if a second mortgage were not required to purchase DLC's some several years old already, just to make the game more varied challenging and enjoyable to play.\nI was going to spend $25.00-$30.00 on DLC's not a lot to some but, a lot to me now, I shall be spending less on something that works as it should and will not require a constant financial input.\nI don't object to paid DLC's but, a game should not force you to buy highly priced DLC's just to make it playable, especially  as this game is buggy however, I suppose fixing it is not as lucrative as producing another $20.00 DLC.\nThe basic game is the bare minumum possible perhaps not even that, in the countries covered there are enough trains new and vintage and miles of track to provide a bigger and more varied starting package and still allow for almost endless DLC's.\nThe devs claim this pricing strategy is to keep the price down on the base game, I feel it is more give the buyer something so basic they'll eventually spend far more money than they would ever have been initially willing to pay to make it playable, just add up the non-discount cost of the base game and say 4 DLC's you could be well on the way to $100.00 even top games cost less than that and many excellent simulators that also have plentiful DLC's provide far more for less cost in the base game.\n\n\n\n\n","June 27, 2014","false","14.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I suspect most people, like me, buy this game for the beautiful scenery and calm journeys across the country side. And because it's on sale. And then after the download disappointment sets in. The manual, if there is one, is probably in pdf format and tedious to read so the tutorial is the obvious place to start. But what you're not told is that the first tutorial in the list teaches you how to drive forward, but doesn't tell you you're starting on a hill. So it seems as if the controls don't work. So give up on the tutorial and jump right in and what meets you? Sad, low rez graphics as you travel  through what could be a breathtaking view but are met with scenery from MS Flight Simulator 3. "Perhaps Career Mode will be better", you think. Think again. For anywhere from $20 to $40 you have to download an add-on to have a career on. Perhaps the graphics are better on these but since the pics and videos they use to sell the game are way better than what you get I wouldn't blow five times the purchase price of the game to find out.","July 1, 2014","false","11.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

As a result you will have to fork out massive amounts of cash in order to get your moneys worth of the full asking price of $54.99 USD.\n\nThe basic game without any DLC comes as barebones as possible and you will almost definitely be looking at which DLC you fancy within an hour or two, and of course having you to spend much more than the already ridiculous base price of $54.99 USD.\n\nAside from the DLC issue, there are two other blatant problems that have not been addressed by the developer. The first is the unrealistic acceleration and braking, which makes this simulator feel much more like an arcade game. The second issue is that you will be left asking where your money's worth is going with the numerous DLC you will undoubtly purchase since the developers rarely patch or update any routes or locomotives that have bugs. You will see cars driving in the air for example, alongside the road.\n\nSince I've bought over 50 different DLC routes and locomotive packs my copy of the game actually has a decent amount of content, but since I've had to spend tenfold on this game as I have on any other; it is simply impossible to recommend it. That said, having spent hundreds of hours on this game I can say that it is enjoyable if you have an interest in trains or trainspotting.","July 1, 2014","false","552.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

If you're familiar with the game, skip this paragraph. Train Simulator has two main features: Driving and building. For driving, you can play various scenarios, or pick a train and roam freely. In the builder, you can build routes from scratch, or edit existing ones, as well as create scenarios. What you make can be uploaded for others to play.\n\nRight then, you know what this game is about. Now I assume you're interested in the game, otherwise why are you here?\nFirst pro/con. Lot's of people will tell you that the DLC is way too overpriced. Agreed. If you can, wait for a sale. But since we're on the topic, there's loads of different DLC's to choose from, all of various regions and countries. American? German? There's something there you may like.\n\nNext pro/con. Almost equal to the DLC complaints are the graphical complaints. You must have a very good graphics card and a fast computer if your picky about looks. You're missing out on a lot without highest graphics settings, such as rain drops on windows, and visible light reflections. Detail on locomotives and freight cars is great (with high graphics settings) and getting better. Sounds are kinda meh, but are also improving.\n\nAnother pro/con. Bugs are of course evident. In what game are they not? If you experience a problem, ask the community, or e-mail Dovetail Game's support team. They show up a fair bit, and chances are, you're not the first to experience it.\n\nFinal pro/con. It's not mentioned that often, but I think it should be. The builder, where I spend most of my time, is very detailed. Practically anything DTG can do, you can do as well. Edit the terrain, place assets from bought DLC, lay track, roads, rivers, fences. You can do practically anything. There's even a Google Maps integration, allowing you to see what things look like at your coordinates, and making it easier to copy a route.\n\nWow, I've written a novel. So that's what to expect in TS2016. I'll let you decide whether or not it's a good game. We all have different opinions.\nDo you think I left something important out?

(the longer ones are only longer due to extended tracks and you hardly need to make any stops) Once the thing is done... Game Over... No replayability here. It's just the same old same old. You cannot even drive the train for as long as you want. making stops when needed to pick up or let off passengers.\n\nFree Roam.... Is non existant as there is none. The the game is called "Train Simulator" is a laugh as you have only a limited trains to drive. They made all the other Trains DLC that are overpriced and SHOULD HAVE BEEN APART OF THE GAME.\n\nThis is a like a copy from DCS Worlds. You get a few planes to try out and if you want to fly something else buy it from the DLC. At least their main game was "FREE" to try out. YOU DO NOT MAKE TAKE AWAY CONTENT THAT IS MEANT TO BE APART OF THE GAME AND PUT THEM AS DLC YOU MONEY GRABING RETRADS!! It's called "Train Simulator" TRAINS ARE MEANT TO BE IN IT.. Not all but ALOT!! Not just one, two or three. but 30 or more. and put the Special trains in as DLC. AT LEAST THAT WOULD BE BETTER!.\n\nSimulate the live experiance.. Lies. Passenages just fade in and out as they either enter or exit. I do not see a passenger entering my train and walking in the passenger car to find a seat or a seat they want. Nope. It's just pre-coded taken up seats and never gets anywhere. The train will always feel lifeless. The stations will always feel Lifeless. COMPLETE GARBAGE!\n\nAnd if your thinking. "Oh hey, lets just add more useless people into the station that will sort this problem out." then you are just a plain simple minded ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Have you ever been the a train station? Ever been to a metro tunnel? I have and I admit, I was a little paranoid in the Metro cause of so many people. (When I visted London it was packed and noisey and very very lively.)\n\nIn this game.\n\nit's just..... silence... People do not wait they just walk like idiots and dance like idiots. At least allow them to *Look at the timetable for the train, or buying drinks at the sides, or even sitting down on chairs reading newspaper or something. When train arrives they can board the train.. RATHER THEN FADING OUT!* Wanting to see people board the trains and watch it slowly fill up is APART OF THE FUN OF DRIVING A TRAIN.\n\nI do not recommend buying this game unless you really really really, want to drive just four or five different trains and even then find out that the trains do not even feel alive.\n\nTo me this game feels like it is VERY MUCH DEAD.\n\nThank you for your time in reading this rant.\n(I am expecting this to be taken down should the rumors of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ taking down these negative remarks on their game be true. It's a harsh world, running from it or hiding it will not make it go away.

By this I mean it advertises itself as being the ultimate digital model railroad software.\n\nSadly, it is not.\n\nIt fails to be a decent simulator, it fails to be a decent layout builder game, and it fails to be a decent game in general.\n\nIn real life, if you build a layout, you can at least know, when you buy new rolling stock, if it's the right scale and the correct gauge, you can run it on your layout.\n\nNot so in Train Simulator.  There's a convoluted path to putting your new rolling stock on to the train table.\n\n"But you're discounting free ride mode."  No, I'm not, because there's nothing immersive about driving a single train through a dead world with no other train but yours in it.  That's just dull and lifeless.\n\nOne of the so-called advantages this game offers is the ability "to build a virtual layout."  Unfortunately, that's not as easy as they make it out to be, either.\n\nCities In Motion 2, Train Fever, and Euro Truck Simulator 2 have much easier, more intuitive "world builder" tools than this game does.  And this is bad because:  Train Fever only generates random maps for you to play on; Cities In Motion 2 really isn't a builder game, either; and Euro Truck Simulator 2 not only has to be reconfigured to access the map building tools, but is not sold on the strength of a user's ability to create new worlds!\n\nAs far as simulation?  While Train Fever currently lacks many simulation features, it still far superior in the simulation department than this game is - in spite of any ability to drive the vehicles - merely because they make the world feel "alive."  The same holds true with Cities In Motion 2, what with it's chronic traffic problems and what not.  And the Euro Truck Simulator 2 simulation is actually more forgiving than the simulation in this game.\n\nWe can all agree, for instance, in real life, driving a train past a red signal is generally bad.  But there are conditions under which - even without dispatcher approval! - most railroads won't really object.  Specifically:  If you're not actually blocking other tracks!  Specifically, if one stops a foot or two too late in this game, it's enough to end the scenario.  I'm pretty sure real railroads don't work like that!\n\nIn Euro Truck Simulator 2, you can sort of get away with things that would force a real life driver off the road, but it's a compromise, since alot of times, the world feels much less predictable (although it's really more predictable, once you learn it) than real life.\n\nWhich brings me to general game play.\n\nI bought a Cab Forward for this game.  Beautiful model.  Beautiful locomotive.  But I can only drive it in two redneck-themed scenarios?  I can't challenge the Cajon Pass with such a beautiful machine - at least, not easily?  Wasn't the point of allowing me to buy this to give me more content to enjoy?  I have "The Empire Builder," which any rail fan recognizes as pretty much the standard configuration of any long distance Amtrak train.  Why can't I run that through something in the Cajon Pass without great difficulty?  Why is it easier to enjoy the new content in ETS2, Train Fever, and Cities In Motion 2 than in Train Simulator?\n\nIn short, this game just plain fails.\n\nIt has huge potential, but all that promise leads to horrible disappointment.\n\nI can not recommend this game.","October 7, 2014","false","67.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It crashes randomly, has major lag spikes and overall feels like an unfinished product rushed for a release. The devs need to make either a major update to it, or make sure TS2015 isn't anything like this game is (which I doubt, considering what I constantly read about this game)\n\n-Long version:\nI bought the game on the summer sale, since I had kept an eye on it for quite some time, and even though I have ~60h of playtime at the time of writing this, I actually have more that 200h of playtime but not on my steam account. Anyway, I bought it mainly because of the editor - the whole google maps overlay, the SRTM terrain data you can use and the tools the editor has alow to make incredibly accurate routes with overall very good detail. That is if the game didn't crash randomly so often. I have lost hours of content due to it not being saved and the game crashing. To counter this I started saving my route every 20-40minutes, but today, after the 4th or 5th crash for the day of the game all my layout's track had disappeared, which made me absolutely mad. Hours of my work was gone! Now, before someone says I'm doing a "rage review" or something I want to say that that was just the tip of the iceberg, which made me write this. The game is completely unstable and unoptimised and the lag spikes I get are even more often than the crashes. Yes, I could have done a backup file, but that is no excuse for a game to be this broken!! Also making your own assets is frustrating and requires you to read A LOT on the forums or other websites just so you have a basic idea of what to do.\n\nAnd I'm not even go on the topic for the unjustified price of the game or it's DLC...","July 7, 2014","false","583.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

What I find most annoying is the pricing of DLC and the game itself. Sure £40 is to be expected of a new game but to repeat that same charge EVERY year just so you can use the next version, don't you think they should perhaps give you a discount if you already own a version of the game, instead of making us pay another £40 just to unlock the new stuff where someone new gets everything (I don't know that fully but I have not tested this). The DLC... wow... I mean really. It is now the 2014 Summer Sales and Steam does a VERY good job at luring us in with these reductions on up to 80%! I was hoping then to maybe go to this game and buy a cheeky Locomotive Add-on with what money I have left over in my Steam Wallet. Oh but wait! Even at prices of up to 60 and 75% off on the DLC, they STILL come out at £7?! What even is that? For DLC I would expect either pennies for the cost of whats in the DLC or at that price, more from the DLC.\n\nI will only keep playing the game till I have racked up enough hours I think to have recieved my moneys worth but in other words I am really dissapointed with this game.\n\nAnother point. Yes this game does do very well to amaze us with the graphics of their locomotives... but that is it. If you go into Free-Roam camera view and stray more than 5 metres away from the track, you will find a terribly under textured enviornment that is plain and boring. The same goes for towns, cars and anything else that is not a train. I would expect much more from a simulator as I do not just expect the experience of the train very good but everything around it to make the mise-en-scene.","June 25, 2014","false","69.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Did not meet my expectations even remotely.\n\nDuring initial launch of the game graphics were flashing in the main menu already and game resolution wasn't the one specified in the options. After 15 minutes of diagnostics I figured that this game seems to work properly only in windowized mode with my setup.\n\nOnce in game I quickly realized that train controls are horrible. Levers are difficult to control accurately with mouse and keyboard controls are total joke. Options contained support for gamepad but surpricingly my gamepad (dualshock) didn't fly... After diagnostics and some googling I found outdated unnofficial analog gamepad plugin to use. Installed that and got my gamepad working somehow, but even that requires running external application behind the actual game and in the end really doesn't save the games poorly designed user interface.\n\nThe content of this game is very limited and they clearly want you to buy DLC to upgrade right away.

I recently grabbed MSTS from the shelf it has sat on for over 10 years. I bought it and never used it. I found it to be fun and an enjoyable break from sim racing. My wife wanted to get Train Simulator 2014 for me so I would have something that worked better and could add content to easier.\n\nWhat a mistake this has been. One of the tutorial missions/ task running the 395 high speed train I have never gotten it to work. I ALWAYS fail at the end. I even got a video from YouTube and the guy that posted it said that he usally fails that task as well. He also said that TS 2014 was VERY buggy. I had heard that before purchasing as well but chalked it up to the usual gripping that I found so often in forums. I should have listened. The problem with the 395 train was just the beginning.\n\nI tried, and just completed a career job, and not only failed it didn't really give me any possibility of not failing. The train coming down from Donner Pass would just take off even though I'm on the brakes. The dynamic brakes don't work. Go ahead and apply them, you will only speed up. They did it in MSTS and they do it here as well.\n\nThe bottom line is this. Unless you just have to have this title, OR you just HAVE to run a train simulator save your money and go and get a different game. I was going to add in quite a bit of extras during the Steam Summer Sale that is going on now until June 30, 2014, that will not be happening now. I guess I'll just take the money and go and get some more stuff for FSX or more sim racing equipment.

The five minute loading screens are such a great aspect because it allows you to become moist and wet for the trains.

The gameplay is absolutely amazing, the simple mode is a little easy, so Expert is where this game really shines. The expert mode uses three levers, movement, direction, and brake and it also comes with an amazing usage of nine camera angles. That's right, NINE CAMERA ANGLES. WHERE DO THEY EVEN HAVE TIME TO PROGRAM ALL THESE ANGLES?! The anti-piracy script put into the game during the loading screens is honestly needed, a game such as this needs to be protected from those nasty pirates that try to ruin game businesses with their cheap ways.

Problems:\n\n1. Game load. It is ultimately slow. About 1 minute to load save/track (for comparison: on my system it takes about 6-7 seconds to load Skyrim save in the worst case).\n2. You can't have more than one save at a time. Yes, really, just one save point. Forgot about possibility to play short 20 min race when long 2h is ongoing.\n3. Image quality. I've played TS at 2008. Really, nothing changed. Same boring non-interesting picture. Skyrim at the High+ settings at the same hardware just flights. TS at Medium became sluggish. And looks like game from year 2000.\n4. Tons of errors. Did you see this "max speed is 60" sign? Don't believe, really it's 40 and have you speed penalty, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Do you see this green semaphore? It's red, really. So, have automatic emergency brake + penalties, of course. Also train can stuck at station at any random moment, and you will be unable to move. Only one workaround - load saved game (1 minute to load and only one save point, you remember).\n5. Track builder. Worst ever seen. Developers should pray to the picture of Chris Sawyer 3 times a day, before, in the middle and after work, may be it helps.\n6. Actually, it's not a game. It's a store. Game trying to force you to buy a some DLC at the any screen, any moment of the time. Very annoying. I want to play. I do not want to buy this forsaken "Latest offer"! As a consequence, very poor initial set of tracks and vehicles. Wanna play a steam loco? Welcome to DLC. Wanna play "This nice track from game review"? Welcome to DLC again. And price tags... mmm... from 13 and up to more than 20 euros per single vehicleor single track? Easily.\n\nConclusion:\nJust a junk game. Wasted time, money and bytes of your hard drive. It feels like developers just want to gain as much money as possible from this game, but they do not want to make good game at all.\n\nHave a nice day,\n--\n\nP.S. May be my review is too offensive, but I'm really disappointed.

I want to be in love with it,but I just can't no matter how hard I try. Although the game looks amazing and the selection of trains is rather good,there are just too many things wrong with it. First,all the missions are SUPER picky. You could have a 100% perfect scenario and only make one little mistake,and the game forces you to try again if you want to truly complete it. Also,the train controls are weird and it never seems that your train can hold a constant speed,which makes it difficult to maintain speed limits.\n\nBut by far the biggest problem with the game is DLC. Oh. My. God. This game is upwards of $60,so you would think you would get an exstensive amount of content included,right? Wrong. You get only a few trains and routes,and you have to pay for everything else. Which would be fine...if it wasn't so damn expensive! Most DLC is priced between $20-40,and the fact that I have to pay that much for one thing after I've already payed quite a bit for the game is absurd. This is the main killing factor for me and it prevents from enjoying Train Simulator as much as I could.\n\nDon't get this game. If your looking for a good train simulation game,try the Trainz series. All of them are fun,have loads of content right out of the box,have free community created DLC,and are a one time purchase. Maybe if my problems with the game were resolved,it wouldn't be so bad. But for now,I stand by my opinion strongly.","December 14, 2014","false","14.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The company which makes raildriver acknowledges the issues and hopes this game will be better supported in future releases, but also recommends a competing train simulator which does have full native support built in for Raildriver (perhaps thats why native support is not included with this game, which is a huge shame). The company who create Train Simulator just ignore you and the entire rest of the people who buys this game and its add ons it seems.\n\nThe game is buggy to say the least and some of the official routes are supplied with scenarios that just don't work or were created for earlier versions of Train Simulator and have been broken in later version with no fixes or updates. For example I bought GEML London to Ipswich - two of the supplied scenarios do not include the needed trains to play the route and at some stations passengers are walking inside the platform. Some platforms are not long enough to fit all carriages of 12 car trains and many of the branch lines on the route have not been included. Many of the free scenarios on the workshop require you to purchase other routes and trains, and for buggy and broken content the game DLC is far too overpriced with some routes costing the same as the game costs, and items rarely appear in steam sales. Every so often you will find mis-matched bundles including a route and a train which includes scenarios designed for a different route - A very cheeky way to encourage people to then buy more trains which contain scenarios for the route they have just bought and the route for the train they have just bought.\n\nCompared to modern games the engine is beginning to look slightly dated as well, but instead of spending time on improving these (I read somewhere the next version will have big improvements to the skies!) the developer should listen to the community and its players and fix broken scenarios and known bugs. I am sure the game has lost fans and community due to its flaws and them being ignored, which is a shame for everyone.\n\nThere is another 3rd company creating routes for this game which they are listening to feedback and creating fixes for their products, so I am going to try a few of them.\n\nI's buy this in a sale if you like this kind of a simulator, but only pay full price if you really love train simulation and are prepered for the issues.","September 2, 2014","false","20.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

They are most interested in making money at the expense of their fan base. I have never enountered a worse developer in my entire life. Rather than make the game interesting, they make the game so bare bones as to force you to purchase the rediculously priced DLC. Instead of spending time making a great game, they spend time making constant payware. Now they may say they don't expect you to buy the $8000 worth of DLC, but they make the game so within playing it a few times it gets repetive. You're basically paying for an engine and interface and then if you want to use it you have to pay for addons that cost as much or more than most games on Steam. I have never played a game, even from EA, where DLC is more mandatory. It's like paying $50 for a free to play game. The new DLC is on the loading screens and just makes you feel like you have to buy it. I don't  understand how Steam allowes this. I mean have they turned into someone like Microsoft or Sony. Valve was always supposed to be the company that cared about gamers, not just their money. The have really dropped the ball here, letting Dovetail release the same game every year and turn out DLC constantly. To make this game enjoyable, you will have to buy thousands of dollars of DLC.

They are most interested in making money at the expense of their fan base. I have never enountered a worse developer in my entire life. Rather than make the game interesting, they make the game so bare bones as to force you to purchase the rediculously priced DLC. Instead of spending time making a great game, they spend time making constant payware. Now they may say they don't expect you to buy the $8000 worth of DLC, but they make the game so within playing it a few times it gets repetive. You're basically paying for an engine and interface and then if you want to use it you have to pay for addons that cost as much or more than most games on Steam. I have never played a game, even from EA, where DLC is more mandatory. It's like paying $50 for a free to play game. The new DLC is on the loading screens and just makes you feel like you have to buy it. I don't  understand how Steam allowes this. I mean have they turned into someone like Microsoft or Sony. Valve was always supposed to be the company that cared about gamers, not just their money. The have really dropped the ball here, letting Dovetail release the same game every year and turn out DLC constantly. To make this game enjoyable, you will have to buy thousands of dollars of DLC. Nothing is included in the game, it's all extra.","September 21, 2014","false","82.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

MANY More engines, more maps and the ability to create your very own train setup for much much much much much much much much much much much much less then this game. Save your sanity and your money and screw this game and go buy TRAINZ simulator.","December 23, 2014","false","23.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I am now changing to negitive.  I got this game back round 2013 and it was a pretty fair game back then.\n\nLast time I tried to play i had to verify the files something you may end up doing a lot. You would think with all the updates to the game it would run great. However each year they add new content and for what ever reason older content just don't work right.  Dovetail games, has killed this game for me. They only seem to be concerned with making new dlc's to make more money instead of fixing the ones they have already.\n\nIt was the 2016 update that broke it bad nuff for my dlc's to not completely function as they once had. I now have textures that will not show up, some trains are not even drivable. As well some scenarios can not be completed with out failing.\n\nIf you want to drive trains and don't care about how real it is or if you can complete the scenarios or not. This maybe for you. If you dont mind spending a ton of money on the game.\n\nI have over a grand in this game atm and wish all parts of it would work, but it does not.\n\nIt really feels like Dovetail dosn't care so long as they get paid.\n\nAs for me, I will be looking into getting a train sim called Run8.\n\nBuy at your own risk.\n\n\n","December 23, 2015","false","762.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

When I finally got it I was so happy. But then the horror started. Took ICE-T for a spin and I noticed it's way more bugged than it was in TS 2012. I switched to High-Speed train in UK. It was very good ride, finished scenario with Silver star. Tried another one, scenario is bugged. Thinking it's one time thing, i restarted game and tried again, same thing happened. Checking forum I saw that it's known bug but nobody is fixing it. Eventually I got stuck with only one scenery I like. At last I deleted game. Two days ago, after few months, I installed it again. I immediately remembered why I uninstalled it in the first place. I was more flexible this time, I gave chance sceneries that didn't amuse me at the begining. I took one route in Germany with DB train. Out of sudden -1800 penalty points for speeding! And limit wasn't even marked. It allowed me to go 140 and invisible limit was 60. Tried another one with Acela Express, train derailed due to intersection changed while I was passing. This is absurd. Don't buy it.

I remember in the 2013 version of this game it had a few different steam trains and I loved it for that purpose. Unfortunately, this game only has ONE steam loco and it is only available in the academy!!! I was never one for the newer trains, I always liked the older steam trains, BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF NEW TRAINS EITHER!!!!! There are like eight different modern trains. But you say, "Oh well just download some DLC and some mods." Well i respond by saying EACH PIECE OF DLC IS AT LEAST EIGHT DOLLARS, ALL OF IT PUT TOGETHER AT A LOVELY GRAND TOTAL OF OVER FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. So unless you are willing to trade your wife, son, daughter, and mortgage for a really expensive train simulator, the DLC is POINTLESS!!!

Many reviewers have voiced various complaints concerning physics, various content (sounds) and DLC costs.  I can understand purists with the dynamics and sounds, which I can take issue with as well, but with DLC, that is an individual choice. The basic game gives us different Country systems to try, and the DLC adds to that enjoyment. However, no one says you have to purchase EVERYTHING. I am from the US and only purchase items that interest me, mostly American units and routes , although a couple of others that look interesting. Folks from other countries I would imagine do the same, so the argument the the DLC is outrageously expensive is subjective to those that want everything in thier collection. The only concession is the reskinning charges which should be minimal or provided as an update to already purchased items.\nI am not so much a hard core player as a casual player, so with that being said, I do like Train Simulator enough to upgrade my computer when necessary. I found no faults with casual railroading, and since space limited me to not have a model railroad, this is the next bext thing, and better in some areas.\nTrain Simulator is enjoyable and a great pasttime,  if you enjoy railroading.

As I am rail fan and had a chance to drive real locomotives, my expectations from simulator are high. Especially, if I paid 40 euros...\nWell, there is significant improvement since first Microsoft Train simulator of course. Especially in terms of visuals. BUT, it seems that authors keep building their overpriced DLC on obsolete engine core. And I am not talking about graphics engine now. I am talking about sim core which is 32 bit, however, it seems it's using all my four CPU cores... Essential is, that despite my dream setup ( core i7 2770K 4,5 GHz, 16 GB RAM, game running on very fast SSD Samsung 840 PRO in RAID!) game's stable fps is constantly being interrupted by stuttering as new tile scenery is loaded. I realize that it's not very possible to load whole route into RAM (I have even tried this with RAMDISK -DID NOT HELP) but this is simulator right? So I would expect to tune core first and not to lure customers on new tracks and impressive screenshots.\nAnother fail are passengers on platforms. The way they move and they behave. Are you serious? After all these years of development they still behave like zombies floating over ground.\nPlease, make this game proper simulator, otherwise I'll keep feeling like another idiot who fell for pretty screenshots...\n\nPROS: Garmisch and Peterborough are nice routes, Superelevatioon, Some audio improvement\nCONS: Totally bad core engine preventing game from running fluid, passengers\n\n","October 19, 2014","false","96.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

It is not a bad game as many people would disagree because the price of DLC but you don't need all that DLC to play this. It is cheaper than buying a real model railroad set which is more expensive than the DLCs in this game. Some of the DLCs may sound terrible or the physics messed up. The controls are the same as MSTS (Microsoft Train Simulator) which is why I like this game.\n\nMost of the DLC prices like for example that the locos would cost you a good $20 like the P42DC, Acela Express, and the Union Pacific Big Boy. Routes would cost you a good $40 like the Weardale & Teesdale Network, North Jersey Coast Line, Marias Pass, and Soldier Summit. There's a lot of DLCs to choose from that you may want to get like Steam engines, maybe you want to drive some freight American trains, or a drive a UK passenger train. The DLCs are mostly focused on UK, Germany, and USA but there's third party DLC on Steam that there's routes outside those 3 countries you could get. Steam hosts sales for this game from time to time so you could wait to buy a add-on if you're on budget and buying the DLCs like in bundles would help too.\n\nPROS:\nRoutes and locos are made from there actual aspects.\nLots of add-ons to choose from.\nGood Visuals for an Old Game Engine\nSupports TrackIR and RailDriver\nHelpful Community\nA lot of things to do such as Rail Fanning, operate a Switcher, Freight Train, or a Passenger Train.\n\nCONS:\nLack of Bug Fixing\nContent with a lot of bugs, missing speed limits on the HUD on certain routes.\nNeeds more advanced features while operating a loco.\nThe DLC's are overpiced\nYou could get into a #rekt stiulation where your loco can derail, game will end if on a passenger train and then you get thrown a game over message stating that the doors are still open after the loading is done, or running out of water on a steam loco when in a good amount.\nMost DLCs would only come with a few scenarios but there's scenarios you can download from the workshop to explore more of the particular route or loco.","January 28","true","368.6"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","13","23","2","1"

Remember the days of MSTS and Trainz, fun right. This is a sub standard game at a beyond premium price. A cash cow. I hope all involved starve and get cancer. Go on, kill yourselves you greedy slimy ♥♥♥♥♥♥s!\n\nEDIT/Clarification: (12 of 21 found it helpful prior to this next bit)\nThis game is really Railworks, very little has changed since 2009.The basic bundled content has not been improved, only year on year they will bundle a couple of different locos with matching stock and a route. The main problem with this is again its not improved. At all! Plants are 2D and follow facing you as you go past, enter a tunnel and a mear shadow is cast.Smoke is unaffected by a bridge, it just floats through the texture. This is all very very outdated, early 2000s stuff.\nThe world has moved on a lot, it's simply unacceptable for this price.\n\nSecondly, considering the poor quality of the game with its ancient engine. It is not fair to charge per single DLC, as they are basic, at that price. I stress that not long ago at all we had modding communitys making anything and everything at a incredibly reasonable monthly subscriptions, this was dial-up days. A lot was on par with what this game is selling as DLCs. Its a locked eco system. And when they do update the game engine or finally write one worth the price tag all of these DLCs will be worthless.\n\nThe developers have you by the balls, and mark my words unless they intend to just rebrand this forever, your £10 per train route whatever is going to be worthless and you will need to start again. The game is far from a product, but while people have a passion and money to burn I guess they are sitting happy at the expense of us.\n\n765,611 people own this game, they have 709 DLCs, profiteering is not the word!\nhttps://steamdb.info/app/24010/","October 3, 2015","false","28.4"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","14","25","4","0"

I recommend this to anyone who is a train fan although there is a few little bugs.

Even with the Glasgow Airport Rail link (about 10 miles long) and the NYC route (Over 100 miles long) are priced the same. This is mainly the only reason I haven't bought any route addons (You dont get £25 steam vouchers where I live).

Excited, I quickly purchased, installed and started playing. Initially, it was all well, until the next morning, after rebooting my computer the checkmarks for my career was missing. The points and XP were still there, so does the badge you collect as you drive more trains, but with the missing checkmarks, it's hard to keep track of which scenario you've had and hadn't done yet! So I skimped over that small blunder, assuring myself that it's an unimportant non gameplay intruding problem, and oh boy was I wrong.\n\nSo on the second day, as I was playing in career mode in a Class 801 (Scenario: The 801 at 8:01), the game started out fine, but my nightmare began once I've reached a red light in Welwyn Garden City Down Fast (opening up the maps indicated an unpowered Class 365 on the tracks). So I waited, and waited (all while spamming the TAB key to request permission to pass) until roughly 30 minutes of waiting before I got the permission to pass. So I told myself, all should be fine now, and I was wrong, again!. Due to this massive delay with the red lights, the timeliness penalty I had was approximately -109000 (can't quite remember the exact figure). Again I told myself, maybe there shall be a big sum of bonus points near the end to neutralize this blunder, so I pushed ahead.\n\nSo as the train was thundering to it's final stop, the lights were all green with a breathtaking scenery to sooth my rage, all is once more well in the world of TS2015. Until suddenly, right on my tracks, slowy emerging from the foggy snowy weather was a stationary Class 365.  As I was sitting there, the train approaching it's inevitable end, I pondered, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS GAME!!!! There was no warning from the lights nor the AWS system! The lights were all green for goodness' sake!\n\nGet this game at your own risk honestly, I do have the save file for the 801 mission stated in this review if you think I was pulling you leg.

That is not worth it at all because other trainz 2006 or such has more of options of steam, desiel, electric trains and you dont have to pay extra from them. And the Workshop isnt so great either you have to buy a certain model for the workshop item to work. other trainz just let you download it free on any website that makes trains and you dont have to buy anything extra or such. Trainz new era is something I haven't got yet but I bet you its alot more better than this game.  Now I would changed my thoughts if it just let the game have the new things in it and not just put it as a addon you have to pay. And the one thing I will be sure of that this game won't get a single penny out of me, but if time goes on and if something great might happen to this game then ill rethink about it. Till then im leaving this game to the unstalled ones.","March 19","false","1.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(Even if load times are slow by todays standards). I started playing the missions in the career mode, the short ones as 1 second in game is one second in real life. I never found a way to fast forward so most of the missions just get boring and repetitive.\nHowever what is forcing me to write this review is the poor design of these missions in terms of letting the user know when speed limits are changing. I was just playing a mission where the speed was 160 (mph I think) and I had 10 minutes until the next station. So I am crusing along enjoying the view as I see no flags (there is a minimap below your controls to let you know when signals or speed changes occur) for miles. then out of the blue the speed dropped to 60, no warning, no signs nothing (I even repeated the mission to check this...still nothing). And once youre speeding (160 in a 60 is serious) you basically loose a ton of whatever points the game is giving you per second (or something) of speeding. So on a mission where I could probably only get 800 points total if I was on time or early to the stations, I am instead loosing 1000+ while trying to get the train down from 160 to 60.\nIt is a total drag when this happens especially after playing the mission for 20+ minutes. I regret buying this game and wish I could recieve a refund.","July 19, 2015","false","7.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No matter what weather and over a hill you cant see becaus it is so tiny a gradient??\n\nOh well - IF and when they become on the side of the game player - make the game playable - and soften their intolerance of their customers - i too would have to say - save your self the pain and stay away!!","June 23, 2015","false","81.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Because I would be gutted and so dissapointed with the purchase otherwise and it would not get played. I did give it a chance however (clocked 4 hours of gameplay most of that spent on the loading screen)\n\nThe actually gameplay was okay, and the graphics were good but.. there was something missing. If you are a true train enthusiast this would appeal to you highly, but I like simulators but really didn't like this one found it very slow and  boring.\n\nTook ages for the game to actually load I must of waited 10 mins and still did not load (and no, its not the hardware in my computer), on top of that extremely annoying music on the load screen. Not the biggest issue but one of the nigly annoying ones, as well as I didn't like the fact that there were ads for Steam on the loading screens.\n\nYou also rely heavily on the mouse at first, the tutorials never mention a keyboard alternative, Only until the point I actually looked at the controls and saw that you could use the keyboard this would of made the game even worse.\n\nSo to conclude unless you are a massive train fan, and can overlook all that is mentioned above.

(only mentioned in the manual)\n- FPS drops\n- glitches like signals remaining red or even AI trains getting stuck.\n- unachievable or too easy schedules (sometimes you can be 5 minutes early, sometimes you will be late, not matter what)\n- no keyboard rebindings\n\nThese bugs are in the standard game career scenarios for more than a year, so it seams that DTG isn't planning to fix them.I find it very strange that they keep pushing out new DLC when the DLC included in the base game still has problems like this.

I've tried driving diesel and electric locomotives, and whilst the sounds, graphics and scenery are very atmospheric, the controls are just too simple to make it a satisfying experience, which I suspect is why a lot of people have given it a thumbs down.\n\nFor steam loco nuts reading this: the algorithms governing steam usage and generation sometimes seem a bit weird, resulting in impossible levels of performance sometimes. But in the best add-ons, all the controls work in the correct senses, and it's possible to drive in the correct style: wide open regulator, controlling speed with cutoff, managing the conflicting demands of steam chest pressure and injectors, building up and running down the fire according to anticipated demand.\n\nYou really do get a proper sense of all the different supplies and demands that have to be managed, from coal to fire to steam to cylinder, from tender to injector to boiler, without doing anything dangerous like allowing a lead plug to fuse, blowing the front off the cylinders with condensation at starting, or getting a blowback in a tunnel.","March 18","true","340.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

First off, who is this for.  Well, those whom like trains, want a simulator which allows you to relax and if desired, build your own content.   It's definetly not for those whom like to pew pew or want fast paced action.   In it's own world, this does require timing, skill, fore thought.   It's quite nice to ride take the runs through the city or country side with out someone chat spamming you or using explenatives which are not kind.\n\nHere you can explore the world via all modes of rail assets.   This includes steam, diesel & electric engines.  Other variables include what you are moving... freight, people.  Then of course, what part of the world would you like to travel in.  And don't forget the change of seasons as well as time of day.\n\nIt is  well supported in the community workshop with a very wide variety to suite about any individual's likings.  There are some extremely brilliant creators which offer very high quality content.   I've found the user group to be most helpful & holding a high level of technical expertise & subject matter.\n\nI have entered several emails to support... all were answered with in 48 hours.\n\nAll componets perform perfectly on my pc with highest level of graphics applied.   Yes, there is alot of DLC which can add up $$,   but just wait for the steam sales and chose items which bring you interest.      Additionally, there are some good 3rd party sites which provide quite a bit of content.\n\nCons... Again to mention the price of DLC content... but on sale it's okay.   And the point loss for speeding... the penalty is excessively high and at times disheartening...

I used to play this before it was bought by Dovetail. Ever since that has happened the game is less a sim and more a game. Where the goal is to get get points, and give dovetail (since actual devs get very little) money in order to get a train or a route. This has turned from a Sim into a black whole for money.\nAs an a side I never sunk money into an add-on because I felt the base was really solid. But now that it is owned by dovetail add ons seems to be what they are forcing on you.\n\nLast a side all dovetail games (that is what they are not sims) have a unproffessional intro video, trying to convert the masses into something which used to be a niche product. This is not always a bad thing, until you compromise quality of the game for user simplicity (and UI features).\n\nOff I go to go Fly (x-plane) or Drive (user pick) in a proper sim.","April 14, 2015","false","46.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","2"

After years of development the core gameplay has hardly changed and the graphics have been dragged into the modern era. Nothing about the core product indicates to me that it's made by train enthusiasts but by corporate managers who have found a business model that delivers the least amount of product for the highest dollar they can get away with.\n\nThe summer edition is listed at $54 but if you bought the addons individually it would be $339   ... right, OK, makes sense to me.\n\nIf you can pick up the base game at a heavy discount then that's a fair deal and you'll get a few hours of enjoyment.  if you pay the requested prices for the addons you're supporting a company that  seems to have no interest in your hobby beyond building OK models and environments.\n\nI keep updating year after year hoping that Dovetail is learning their craft and will really provide an inspiring simulation product but at this point they've demonstrated they do not have the abiility and/or interest.  Rail fans really should be purchasing and supporting another company who is as enthusitic about their passion and wish to provide a full simulation rather than a fairly simple game.","April 24, 2015","false","350.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

The DLC tends to be quite glitchy and low quality, considering you could pay £20+ for some of the DLCs. The game itself runs OK, although it does drop frames even when graphics settings are turned down (that's with a GTX 960 2GB card) but that is probably due to my setup.\n\nSo, bottom line is if you have to buy it, wait for the price to come down in a sale. If you do buy it, you'll be downloading DLC within about a week, since there's not very much to play in the base game. If you're considering getting all the DLC, you probably consider spending the money on becoming a real train driver, it would cost about the same!","April 12","false","60.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It is a mostly working game. You get nicely modelled trains with pretty accurate routes, each uniquely made.\nI do find though, dovetail games disrespects its role for Rail Fans. Nothing comes close to the detail, but again, nothing comes close to the price.\nThere are quite a few glitches, bugs and general annoyances with this game which could be easily spent time on and fixed, leading to an improved game and better product instead of churning DLC out at a phenomenal rate. I personally would really like to be able to get my hands on atleast a good chunk of the British Routes as i live in the UK.\n\nI really don't like giving what could be such a promising game for every Rail Fan in this world a negative rating but the handling of this game by those who own it damages the experience that we should be getting.\n\nIs it not possible for Dovetail to just do something and change quite a lot of its greedy ways?","February 23, 2015","false","207.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Meanwhile on standard and Carrer mode it almost impossible for me to complete a sceanrio due to 90% of the time the game crash when I driving in the middle of the sceanrio. to make thing worst even I create the tactic of saving the game every 15 minute so If the game does crash I dont have to start over, well that  tatic backfire as most of the time when my game does crash it basically erase THAT RIGHT ERASE my save history. the bright sight is train simulator 2016 is coming, and I hope that game will fix my issue of what I having on this game but honestly I fed up with dovetail making game patch update that pretty much does ♥♥♥♥ all. and the fact that these update is actually making the game MORE UNPLAYABLE for me is just ridicously ironic","December 20, 2013","false","184.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"
