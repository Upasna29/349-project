"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadrunner1/recommended/284200/","roadrunner1","Road Runner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadrunner1/","551 products in account","My first impressions of Robot Rescue Revolution... it's basically a puzzle game. All the robots move at the same time, so you must be careful when you make a move, not to move a robot into a trap. Try to avoid all dangers and lead all the robots to the exit. Well, that's the game in a nutshell. There are quite a lot of mechanics that make the game interesting and challenging. It starts off easy, with 15 tutorial levels, where you're introduced to all the game's obstacles and objects. And, of course, it gets harder while you progress. The game looks cheerful, with vibrant, colorful graphics. It makes good use of Steam features such as  Steam Cloud, achievements, leaderboards and Trading Cards. It supports Big Picture and has full controller support. I use a XBox 360 controller, works like a charm. It also has an ingame level editor, were you can create and share your own levels. I got the game for free but I don't have any problems recommending it for the price. It's quite cheap for what you're getting imo.","July 11, 2014","true","2.1"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/284200/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game, even if it does use the Steam additions for games effectively. I got this game for free from voting on Greenlight, but it was 5 months wasted of waiting to see how this turned out. To be honest, I would preferably give this a "decent" option if the Steam Reviews had those, because it wasn't as awful as others I've played, like Pixel Piracy.\n\nThe visuals were nice at first, but they got more boring and had the same old cartoony look most platformers I've seen have. Nothing too eye popping for me, but it isn't eye meltingly horrible as other games. Not much to say on the visuals other than it seems to have the same old, cartoony, bland look to it.\n\nThe gameplay was actually enjoyable at first, but it really doesn't bring much to the table here. It was solid, the puzzles actually require thinking, and the level maker was pretty fun to use. However, the earlier levels have some kind of huge difficulty spike in them. Yes, I just said they actually require thinking, but it's better if they actualy make them a bit more simple at first, and then have the difficulty go up and up. The difficulty spikes were not fit for a game like this to me, unfortunately. Also, I can't stand hitting Enter every single time I want to restart a level. Why not just use the LMB? It makes life a lot easier, because using Enter just seems like a weird way to do things. In it's defense though, Mass Effect 2 was similar to the style RRR had, and that execution turned out to be not much better. Not much to say, other than the annoying abuse of Enter and the fact nothing was really added to RRR.\n\nThe story, well, there isn't really much of one. You save robots for a vague reason. It's straightforward for the most part, but maybe they could've explained the robots' story some more? Pretty vague, but at least it isn't nonexistent.\n\nThe audio is probably the best thing to the game, shockingly. I began playing my games with headphones recently to add on to my experiences, and I realized RRR has a pretty impressive main menu song, and the songs that play in the levels sound great, too. I highly praise this game's music. The sound effects also sound nice, but at times, they sound way too loud.\n\nThe replayability is hard to determine at the moment (look at my hours) but it does have a level editor, and you can also get levels made by the community in the game's workshop, so that's a good (and rare) thing in a game like this. The high scores seem meaningless, but I was never much for high scores anyway.\n\nA major pro to this game is that it implements the Steam additions effectively. It's one of the main reasons this game gets the "meh" and not the "bad" score. Also, the dev seems to be very generous because they're doing it with other games, too. They're also dedicated to the game, even when it isn't in Early Access. Kudos to them for being dedicated.\n\nIn the end, RRR does NOT suck, even with it's plenty of flaws. However, it falls short of being a good, fun, cute game and has too many flaws, and rely heavily on some pretty major things I've only seen few games do. In the end, you could get the game, but you won't have as much of an experience as other puzzle games out there.\n\nGraphics- 6.5/10\nGameplay- 6.5/10\nStory- 4.5/10\nAudio- 9.0/10\nReplayability- 7/10\n\n.:6.2/10:.\n+Great devs\n+Awesome music\n+Solid controls\n+Uses Steam additions effectively\n-Relies too much on the Enter key\n-Massive difficulty spikes on some levels\n-Annoying and loud sound effects\n-Bland visuals\n-Has room for a stronger story (Not surprised, but seriously could've had one)","July 19, 2014","false","2.2"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","1"
