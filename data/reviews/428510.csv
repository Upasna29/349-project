Though the gameplay is different than Faerie Solitaire and games like that.  In this one you click on match pairs of the same number.  Your goal is to get all the gold special cards.  There are 3 bonus abilities you can use:  Shuffle, Undo, and Wild Card.  You can buy them in the in-game store with the coins you earn by playing, or occasionally you get a free one by matching a card with an asterisk (*) on it.\n\nThere are 2 difficulty levels, and 12 groupings of 10 levels each.  In the easy difficulty you can replay any level you want any time.  In the hard difficulty you have to replay from the first level in each group.  Each group has a different background (though some are just a mirror image or a smaller portion of a previous larger one).\n\nYou can change the image on the card decks any time, even mid-game.  This is especially helpful on levels with a dark background or light background where you want a contrasting color to see the cards easier.\n\nNote to achievement hunters:  If you want to get all the achievements then I recommend you NOT to purchase any bonuses in the store, because one of the achievements is to earn one million coins.  And if you keep buying stuff then it will take longer to get than achievement.  It took me about 30 hours to get all the achievements.\n\nThe music is very nice and pleasant.  It changes and shifts so that it doesn't get boring.\n\nMinor bugs:  One level has a black background; whatever the image is supposed to be, it does not load correctly.  And occasionally a bug will happen when matching one of the * cards where it magically collects all the gold cards even though they are still buried.  But that's a bug in my favor so I'm not complaining!","February 25","true","33.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","3"

Finishing that game, I need to get maximum score on it. Then another game, because it only takes a couple of minutes to do one. Then another. Then another.\n\nA couple of annoyances though:\n- Picking a Joker, then deciding not to use it anyway, there is no way to cancel it - at least I haven't noticed how.\n- When a bonus reward is shown, card selection is locked for a few seconds, even when the screen has cleared.\n\nOther than those very minor things, this is an absolutely great casual card game.","February 20","true","13.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I played long enough to collect the trading cards (which for some reason took longer than normal).\n\nOn the good side:\nNice card layouts\nBackground are is pleasant\nEasy to pick up and play for short bits or longer\nOn the not so good side\nVery little strategy involved\nRandom cards at times don't have matches in the deck  (I've ended up with one card left, so impossible to complete without using a Joker)\nMusic gets old and very repetitive\nNothing special to break up the repetitive nature of this game (I suppose achievement hunters could use those to keep things a bit more interesting.\nI can't really recommend this one unfortunately, there are better choices out there.  A game with potential if some change of pace were added like a story line to make you want to keep playing or added play features as you went along.","May 14","false","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's basically mahjong with cards rather than tiles (the main difference being that you have a draw deck).\nIt's quick to pick up, I like the light theme, there's a nice point system and cheats you can earn, and I really love the sound track for some reason.\nMy one major complaint is that the cards is the deck combined with the tableau won't always add up to a complete deck. Most of the time this is barely noticeable, but on occasion you get an initial set-ups that has no chance of being completable without using a cheat since the card you need isn't even in the deck. I've only noticed this a couple times, but it bugs me quite a bit.\nThat being said, it's a nice casual game that's not too expensive.","February 10","true","16.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
