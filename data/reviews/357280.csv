There are great details and very intriguing designs in this little game.\n\nIt certainly isn't for beginners of the genre though - the puzzles are challenging and sometimes on the brink to pure frustration because you will have to time your jumps very precicely. Therefore I didn't like the fact that I couldn't customize the controls. Another disappointment was the ending of the game. I just expected more and in all honesty:\nIs there anyone who wouldn't try to save the dog?! Making the player go through the whole game again to get all the achievements is just rude.\n\nThe funniest part of this game was having a friend watching and laughing about the inevitable fails.\nSo I wouldn't really recommend playing it alone unless you like frustrating challenging gameplay & make sure to pick it up at a discount.\n\n5/10","June 23, 2015","true","2.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

That was reason enough.\nSo, i did not check the game out first. What can I expect from this tiny indie game?\n\nThe visuals reminds me on Jonathan Blow's masterpiece "Braid". Also, "Alter World" has this very unique gameplay mechanics - like "Braid" had. Thats the two only things, they do have in common.\n\nLike "Braid", this game here brings out of a "dead-genre" something very fresh and special, not seen, or played before - into a well known genre. And this alone, is very hard to achieve. So whats so special about "Alter World"?\n\nIts the game-mechanics - to "alter" the world - switch between a "light universe" and a "dark one". Its like yin and yang - one needs the other - to become one. But dont get fooled, by the game's beautiness and cute (or dark) looks.\nBehind it hides a very tough and brutal platform experience - that lets you sometimes curse the game for its toughness - and you really wanna throw the controller into the screen - out of the 100 try - on those damn hard stages. If you finally manage, to beat those, its very satisfying.\n\nThe art-style of the game is very beautiful, also its very colorful and vivid. Every level, is only placed, on one screen - but still looking all the time, like a painted oil picture. And you never get bored, looking on those levels.\n\nBe warned. The controls feel in some situations a bit broken - but i am not sure, if It was just me, getting tired, on those damn hard stages. And if you tried again and again - and just the slightest of wrong movements / jumps gets you killed - I dunno, if thats true, it could be the controller or also the loss of focus and concentration. And if its, on those hardest of hard levels - one can be very easily pushed to its breaking point.\n\nI recommend this unique, fresh clever little platformer. But be wary, it has his flaws - and you will need a lot of coffee.","December 21, 2015","true","2.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

Platformers and ARPGs are my absolute favorite types of games to play, and I'm interested in most things with a fantasy, paranormal, or medieval aspect.\n\nThis game seemed to include fantasy, platforming, and alternate/parallel realities that you can switch between. I thought it would compare to Chronology, Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams, and Contrast.\n\nUnfortunately, I found myself frustrated with the poor controller function. I'm not an impatient gamer, so I hung with it awhile, but no matter how hard I tried, there was no consistency to the controls. Sometimes controller function worked the way I expected, and sometimes it didn't. In games like this, though, there must be consistency. You can't have "quick-switch" mechanics if the controls are unreliable.\n\nFor example, in an early level where you see the text, "sometimes just wait," I couldn't move to the right or left and jump at the same time, and just simply jumping didn't get the character where it needed to go. I finally gave up and just fell off the first landing to the left, only to land at the finish line below. That shouldn't happen.\n\nThe graphics and artwork were okay and even a bit interesting from a minimalist standpoint, but I did notice the poor grammar in some of the text.\n\nThis game needs a lot of work, but I'd be among the first to pick it back up once changes are made.","February 15","false","0.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

The gimmick of the game is to alternate between worlds while navigating well crafted, precision platforming levels. The game itself can be challenging however due to it's forgiving nature, it doesn't feel like the game's overly difficult or frustrating. Gorgeous aesthetics and soundtrack give the game a relaxing tone, and help keep the game feel interesting, especially with new mechanics such as gravity introduced during the playthrough.\n\nOverall the game's challenging enough for more hardcore fans of platforming games however, forgiving and interesting to help beginners such as myself, to enjoy themselves.","May 31, 2015","true","3.2"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

That was reason enough.\nSo, i did not check the game out first. What can I expect from this tiny indie game?\n\nThe visuals reminds me on Jonathan Blow's masterpiece "Braid". Also, "Alter World" has this very unique gameplay mechanics - like "Braid" had. Thats the two only things, they do have in common.\n\nLike "Braid", this game here brings out of a "dead-genre" something very fresh and special, not seen, or played before - into a well known genre. And this alone, is very hard to achieve. So whats so special about "Alter World"?\n\nIts the game-mechanics - to "alter" the world - switch between a "light universe" and a "dark one". Its like yin and yang - one needs the other - to become one. But dont get fooled, by the game's beautiness and cute (or dark) looks.\nBehind it hides a very tough and brutal platform experience - that lets you sometimes curse the game for its toughness - and you really wanna throw the controller into the screen - out of the 100 try - on those damn hard stages. If you finally manage, to beat those, its very satisfying.\n\nThe art-style of the game is very beautiful, also its very colorful and vivid. Every level, is only placed, on one screen - but still looking all the time, like a painted oil picture. And you never get bored, looking on those levels.\n\nBe warned. The controls feel in some situations a bit broken - but i am not sure, if It was just me, getting tired, on those damn hard stages. And if you tried again and again - and just the slightest of wrong movements / jumps gets you killed - I dunno, if thats true, it could be the controller or also the loss of focus and concentration. And if its, on those hardest of hard levels - one can be very easily pushed to its breaking point.\n\nI recommend this unique, fresh clever little platformer. But be wary, it has his flaws - and you will need a lot of coffee.","December 21, 2015","true","2.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

Platformers and ARPGs are my absolute favorite types of games to play, and I'm interested in most things with a fantasy, paranormal, or medieval aspect.\n\nThis game seemed to include fantasy, platforming, and alternate/parallel realities that you can switch between. I thought it would compare to Chronology, Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams, and Contrast.\n\nUnfortunately, I found myself frustrated with the poor controller function. I'm not an impatient gamer, so I hung with it awhile, but no matter how hard I tried, there was no consistency to the controls. Sometimes controller function worked the way I expected, and sometimes it didn't. In games like this, though, there must be consistency. You can't have "quick-switch" mechanics if the controls are unreliable.\n\nFor example, in an early level where you see the text, "sometimes just wait," I couldn't move to the right or left and jump at the same time, and just simply jumping didn't get the character where it needed to go. I finally gave up and just fell off the first landing to the left, only to land at the finish line below. That shouldn't happen.\n\nThe graphics and artwork were okay and even a bit interesting from a minimalist standpoint, but I did notice the poor grammar in some of the text.\n\nThis game needs a lot of work, but I'd be among the first to pick it back up once changes are made.","February 15","false","0.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

It´s  verry depressing, there is this lovely character and the peacefull music etc. and you just jump...die, jump...die every ♥♥♥♥ing time. The game is revarding of course, if you beat a level after 100 deaths you get a new level wich is almost the same as the previous one, BUT a little harder :*\nThe game is a good platformer, but I don´t like it.","December 8, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It starts off fairly charming, but as you progress into the later stages of the game, the controls in the gravity levels are highly frustrating and then jumping at times feels like you have a sack of potatoes under your jacket.\n\nSaying that, it's not a completely awful experience, the music between the two universes really adds atmosphere to the game, but if you suffer from any form of gamer rage, do yourself a big favour and avoid.","January 16","false","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
