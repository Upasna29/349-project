After several iterations the designers attempted to invert their original idea. Unfortunately most innovative features of its predecessors get lost in the process and the final result Anomaly Defender is just an insipid sub-par Tower Defense. The main issues being a dull gameplay and the lack of challenge.\n\n+ The game use the Unreal engine, and like the other Anomaly games it is technically well made with neat graphics.\n\n+ The technology tree is well made and offer decent choices.\n\n- The biggest flaw of the game is the poor gameplay, there are two part to this:\n\nFirst, on the strategic level there is not much decisions to make and creative ways to place your towers. You can only build towers on specific locations outside of the enemy path, which means no “mazing” option. Then the choices are pretty obvious, place your long range towers in the back row, and your more resilient close range tower closer to the enemy paths. In contrast one of the best thing in the previous Tower Attack games was the ability to plan, and change on the fly, your attack route, giving you the ability to approach strong positions from a favorable angle.\n\nSecondly, during the action proper, the enemy advance at a slow pace, but when they come in the vicinity of your towers most of the action consist of pausing the game to activate your towers special powers. The maps design makes it worse as many times enemy waves attack from different directions, often outside of the screen view. This lead to even greater micromanagement, the scrolling speed being too slow, yo have to pause the game constantly to activate and repair your towers in various parts of the map. Overall it kills the real time feeling associated with tower defense, of seeing the enemy trying to overwhelm your base.\n\nTo “spice” things up there are random hazards in some levels, like meteorites falling down damaging both your towers and the enemy. In practice I found it was just a terrible, and unsuccessfull attempt to add something to the poor gameplay.\n\nThere is more or less a story in the campaign, but it is completely forgettable, and in contrast to the previous game in the series where action was tense and atmospheric, voice acting and special events don't add anything in this one.\n\n\n- To make thing even less interesting the game offer little challenge:\n\nThere are 24 maps in the game. It starts with easy tutorial like maps, but actually half of the maps are very basic and uninspired. Few are challenging and in most case the enemy never came close to even scratch my base. In the end only the very last level on hard difficulty was a real challenge who required several attempts, a carefully thought out plan and proper combination of various type of towers and powers. Most other times the first and obvious towers placement was good enough.\n\nThe game has 3 difficulty levels, the problem is the way you earn the Tech Points so critical to unlock the better towers and special powers. Completing a level on easy/normal/ hard give you around 6/8/9 Tech Pts respectively (more pts on the later level but the proportions are the same). The game is not really hard and I make my first play-through on normal. However I could have played all levels on easy first to gather plenty Tech Pts and to make my attempts on normal so much easier. Somehow giving so much points for the easy levels ruin the gameplay. I strongly encourage you to play on normal first, and move back and play previous levels on hard if you really need extra Tech Pts.\n\nIn the end the game was just a disappointment. It is vastly inferior to the previous Anomaly games, and fail even on the basics of Tower Defense.","November 16, 2015","false","19.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

It doesn't seem to have much variety and has the standard rock-paper-shotgun formula with the towers. To start off there are some negative points I would like to point out. The towers lack proper descriptions and the interface is somewhat disgraceful. I never used any hotkeys because I don't think this game really has any. There is no information regarding towers and it took me longer than I would like to admit to notice that the health/damage/range of towers is displayed at the top of the screen. I guess my screen is so big that a few words at the top don't really grab my attention. As for the rest of it, the enemy damage is very very managable until a point. Some enemy units just pulverize your cannons and there is so little you can do about it. The enemy has disruption which prevents cannons from shooting and some of the missions do as well. I think there are 4/25 missions that have interference from the environment and they can be frustrating as they can be very random. Lightening missions cause towers to stop working and some missions have debris falling on your head which is very very random. I have had it on hard mode and cleared without an issue and then go on easy and just can't keep my turrets up because debris just won't stop landing on them.\n\nThat said, the game itself is rather entertaining. I don't think it has much replay value but if you are looking for a good 10 minute tower defense game, just take a map and go for it. It had some novel concepts in it, like towers can only be placed in certain places etc. which give it more of a challenge which both annoyed me but made it unique and fun. I would definately recommend this game to people who enjoy a good tower defense game. It won't be so hard that you rip your hair out but it isn't so easy (well, it can be) that you can afk out and survive.","October 18, 2014","true","14.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I've played through 7 of the 24 levels, all on Medium difficulty (there is also Easy and Hard). Can't really compare it to other full-fledged TD games since I am not much of a fan of the genre, but all I can say is that it is a good TD representation of the Anomaly series.\n\nThe towers and the human units would be familiar if you've played the previous Anomaly games. Defenders builds upon that, and you have abilities as well (similar to the previous games, again). You can upgrade units, and sell them on the fly. There is a skill tree too that uses points you accumulate after every successful mission, where you have some amount of freedom to chart your way forward.\n\nOne nice feature is that you can pause the game to strategize, and also build towers, apply abilities and upgrade all while the game is paused...too many TD games are just so action-packed you don't have time to think at all.. But that's not the case here.\n\nIt's kind of obvious Anomaly Defenders had less work put into it compared to Anomaly 2 judging by the graphics and the lack of story, but the good thing is the gameplay doesn't seem to have been truncated and the price is at least reflective of the smaller effort put into the game. 24 levels seem quite a bit, and you can replay earlier levels on harder difficulties when you've unlocked better upgrades in the skill tree.\n\nOverall, if you were a fan of the Anomaly games prior to this, I'd recommend Anomaly Defenders. Decent amount of content, strong gameplay (even if it starts off too easily) and a reasonable price-tag.","May 29, 2014","true","10.0"," 43 of 78 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","43","78","0","0"

They play differently no doubt and it is more akin to Defense Grid but with offensive enemies that will attack your base. On easy mode, this would require you to manage each tower with less vigilance, but on higher difficulty, it would be more of a chore than anything else. Assuming you like such activity, it would surely entertain you. Otherwise, I'd suggest you try basic TD games where enemies are passive in action.\n\nOverall a great game, but if you had played Defense Grid 1 or 2, there is no reason to delve into it, yet. Again, it all boils down to which type of enemies you want: active or passive. That's the only thing different between this and DG. DG however seems to have more varieties overall.\n\n","October 15, 2014","true","3.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultanium/recommended/294750/","ultanium","Ult","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultanium/","409 products in account","I have a somewhat unhealthy addiction to Anomaly games, so this review maaaaay be a little biased. Especially more so seeing as I can safely say this is my favourite entry in the series. The previous three Anomaly games were purely tower offense oriented where the player would roll out with a convoy of vehicles and clear certain checkpoints, rescue some scientists, or travel from A to B. Anomaly Defenders moves away from this to a tower defence perspective and does this to exceptional standards.\n\nSTORY\nAfter years of war and suffering at the hands of alien torment, the human fleet is now ready to carry out its own invasion against a race that once threatened its very existence. The Commander from the first three Anomaly games decides he no longer wishes to take part in the genocide that would soon follow, and therefore makes the hard call of commanding the alien units in defending escape pods to off-planet. And that's where YOU come in.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe game is aimed at both casual and hardcore tower defence strategist with elements of simplicity and complexity involved. Familiarising yourself with the types of enemy units and propelling the right towers to dispatch those tanks is crucial in understanding the balance. You have your basic selection of various tower units with their respective upgrades. Towers are placed on spawning hotspots with each tower consisting of three possible upgrades. You also have perks and functions in your arsenal to add an extra layer of buff to tower durability and longevity, as well as influcing your rate of income. Maps vary with some symmetry and linear designs, but all fairly challenging as the missions and difficulty progress. The variety in units also help in the challenge factor as you will strive to find ways to gain the upper hand against certain unit types.\n\nYou should expect to pump out anywhere between 4 to 30 hours worth of playtime depending on how you play the game. If, like me, you plan on completing everything then you will find yourself spending anywhere between the 20-30 hour mark trying to complete the game on easy, normal and hard difficulties. Alternatively a single run should take anywhere between 4-7 hours depending on how familiar you are with tower defence games. Unfortunately campaign is the only game mode in Anomaly Defenders and it only spans 24 missions. There really isn't a great deal of replay value unless you wish to mix and match upgrades in the technology tree. Some sort of map creator/sharing service would have been a nice addition.\n\nGRAPHICS & AUDIO\nGraphically the game is onpar with past Anomaly games. Looks great and runs well without falter. You will encounter various environmental conditions whether that be lightning storm or meteorite showers which adds to the level of detail. One complaint I do have is that for every kill there is a flash of light. This may not seem like a big deal, but imagine killing 6 units within 10 seconds. Your screen will be freaking out. If you have any issues with flashing images due to medical conditions, I would recommend you steer clear of this game.\n\nFor the first time in an Anomaly game I actually enjoyed listening to the announcer in the background. Voice acting is usually quite poor, but they seemed to have nailed it on this. The soundtrack only has four tracks but they are really good. I found the game to be that much more exciting listening to the exhilerating music pounding away in the background. It got the job done and that's all that matters.\n\nOVERALL\nA fantastic final entry in the Anomaly series and one that should definitely be checked out by tower defence fans.\n\nPROS\n+Fantastic way to end the series. Full on tower defence.\n+Technology tree expands on gameplay.\n+24 action packed missions - bumped to 72 if achievement hunting.\n+Visually looks stunning.\n+Soundtrack is excellent.\n\nCONS\n-Screen flash for every kill.\n-No additional game modes to add replayability other than difficulty settings.","September 27, 2014","true","22.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

The first two Anomaly games were unique as they did a unique twist and had you controlling the enemy wave instead with the goal of destroying towers and getting to the goal. Not only that, but you had a story-driven campaign and you could easily see the production values that went into those games. The 2nd game even had two player co-op. It was just getting better and better...\n\nWhen I realized Anomaly Defenders came out, I immediately purchased it. Within the first 5 minutes of playing, I was disappointed greatly. The last game did a complete 180 and you now control the alien towers. So just a generic tower defense game... great. This is even further solidified that it lacks any story-driven campaign and you're not sure why you should care about these aliens. The Technology Tree of upgrading towers and unlocking new skills/passives is cool, but it doesn't make the gameplay any less mundane. I'm currently on Mission 21 of 24 and slowly forcing myself to finish it and get it over with. I even noticed some of the missions are re-hashes of older ones.\n\nThanks for ruining the franchise 11 bit studios!","July 2, 2014","false","19.0"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","17","32","0","0"

And killing pesky humans! Who wouldn't jump at the chance?\n\nThe game is about how to manage your income and optimally allocate turrets. It takes a while to figure out which technologies/turrets work best in what situations. Eventually you find and set up some pretty powerful turret combos. The basic "blaster" turret is extremely powerful and durable when fully upgraded. I didn't think the booster turret (the one that doesn't shoot and only supports other turrets) was worth it, it took up a spot and didn't really do much, and the enemies would usually go for that first for some dumb reason.\n\nThe pause feature is pretty huge. It makes any turret setup or tactic manageable to execute. It really took the steam out of the later levels. Maybe that is the point? If you don't ever use pause to play let me know how it goes.\n\nEach turret can have a special ability, and you get to manage all that and passive bonuses in a tech tree. I found that the energy bonuses and the sniper ability (which increases range of turrets) were very, very powerful. It's the only way to get a decent number of turrets firing on each enemy, which makes some of the boss-type encounters into a joke. I thought it was fun to manage all the angles and set up spots where I'd set of bunch of turrets to sniper, so that the big tanks would get crushed.","October 5, 2014","true","13.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In the previous games the player controlled Human forces in a unique "tower offence" mode. Defenders changes the format, and now the player controls the aliens in a more traditional tower defence mode. The aliens are fleeing their homeworld, and you need to prevent the Humans from destroying spaceship launchpads. The main twist compared to other TD games that I've played, is that the Humans can shoot your towers, instead of just ignoring them.\n\nAs with most TD games, you can build and upgrade various types of towers using carusarum (effectively money). Carusarum is earned by killing enemy units and you can also build harvester towers to extract carusarum from specific points on the map. You can also use special abilities on your towers, such as repair, rage (damage buff), sniper (range buff) and shield (reduce damage). These abilities cost energy, which is also gained from killing enemies.\n\nThere is a tech tree which allows you to spend points on upgrading the strength of your towers and abilities, improve your economy through improved efficiency of harvesters and better cost of buying/selling towers, and increase energy storage. You gain tech points for completing maps based on score and difficulty, and spend them between missions.\n\nI wouldn't say there is a great variety in towers or enemy units. Most are as seen in the previous games, I think the only new enemies are the aircraft. A couple of maps have environmental effects, such as electromagnetic storms and falling debris, which can disable/damage your towers and enemy units.\n\nI played on the middle of three difficulty levels, and only lost one of the 24 maps, but the second half of the game does get quite frantic. I can imagine the top difficulty could be quite challenging. I think my previous experience with the franchise helped me to quickly figure out the best placement for each type of tower. Later map layouts become fairly complex, with enemies attacking simultaneously along multiple ground and air paths. You can influence the enemy path with your harvesters, because the Humans will try to attack those before your launchpad.\n\nThe story is non-existent, which is disappointing. The previous games' stories weren't amazing but at least they made an effort. I also find it strange that the Humans don't have a commander (the player unit in previous games). I guess it might have been difficult to program the AI controlling him, but it doesn't really make sense based on the established series lore. The Human forces would get annihilated quickly in the previous games without the commander, so why attack now without him?\n\nThe music is fantastic and I didn't experience any bugs. There are no mid mission checkpoints, which means if you lose a map (or crash for any reason) its back to the start. Each map should only take around 20 minutes though. I finished the campaign in 8 hours which is fine relative to the low purchase price.\n\nOverall, if you like tower defence and have a few hours available, this is worth checking out.","July 4, 2014","true","16.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Anomaly Defenders is a Tower Defence game, instead of the well-renowned Tower Offense games. This is contrary to the thing that makes the Anomaly Franchise stand out of other games. The Anomaly Franchise is famous for its Tower Offense games and I felt that Anomaly Defenders ruined it, therefore I would not recommend you getting this game.\n\nIf you are new to the Anomaly Series and you are interested in getting this game, try Anomaly: Warzone Earth or Anomaly 2 instead as I do feel that the gameplay in those games are more enjoyable, especially when the Anomaly Franchise is well known for its Tower Offense. If you are interested in a Tower Defence game, don’t waste your money on this game and I would suggest you getting Sanctum 2 instead. If you had played the other games from the Anomaly Series and you are interested in getting this game, do not bother getting this game too, unless you are a hard-core fan of the Anomaly Franchise and have extra cash to spend on.","January 1, 2015","false","5.8"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Not even short the short text based level intro conversations that are often used to set the mood. Other than a location name and a description of the level you are given no background whatsoever.

Anomaly Defenders completely abandoned that and made a simple Tower Defense game.  This completely and totally destroys the story, and made it hard for me to even care about what happened.   The player is to now defend the aliens, who originally invaded earth killing millions of people, by now destroying the humans who are now here to wipe the aliens out...uh...ok.\n\nStory aside, there are some PROs.\n\nThe Good:+ Graphics.  The graphics that are in the game are pretty good.\n\n+ Level Design.  Overall, this was good as some levels were nicely laid out allowing for different strategies.\n\n+ Polished.  Overall this is a pretty well-done and polished game.\n\nThe Eh:~ Graphic Style.  Eh, I would have preferred a more realistic / natural style similar to the previous Anomaly games which are also, and most importantly, ON LAND as that would be a better and more natural place for an invading army.  Instead the invasion is on some sort of orbital space station?  Every time?  And with tanks?  Uh, ok...\n\n~ Audio.  Voice-overs and audio are both OK.\n\n~ Pause Button.  Having a Pause button available which only pauses one-party, allowing the player to continue to issue commands, seems like built-in cheating.  Makes me feel that they did this because they didn't implement check-points.\n\nThe Bad:- Story.  I'm playing to destroy humans...<shakes head>\n\n- Limited tower placements.  Particularly for Scorchers that only fire straight-ahead.  Many times there's a pad just HALF a path off center, now completely useless as a pad for a Scorcher.  In fact, there are only a few placements that a Scorcher can be reasonably placed.\n\n- No Checkpoints.  If for whatever reason you need to start over, you're starting the entire level over.\n\n- Randomness in some levels.  The constant rain of meteors on one level, or lightning strikes disabling towers.  Ugh.\n\nAnomaly Defenders gives you 24 missions in the Campaign, and I didn't see much re-play other than playing the same levels again in the 3 levels of difficulty.  The campaign took me 6.9 hours to complete.\n\nIf you want a good Tower Defense game, go check out Defense Grid.  Anomaly Defenders is if you really like the Anomaly series and just want more (even if it is Defense instead of Offense).\n\n6 out of 10.\nIt's "Recommended" for those who like the Anomaly series as the game is fairly polished and well-done.  However, if you're unfamiliar with the Anomaly series and just like Tower Defense games, I'd look elsewhere.","January 24, 2015","true","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherasfox/recommended/294750/","etherasfox","Etheras","http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherasfox/","325 products in account","I purchased this game during a dry period in strategy gaming, knowing nothing about it really except that it had decent reviews. I later discovered that its part of the Anomaly series (the Tower Offense series ... which I hadn't played, so that never really came to mind for me). So I found myself jumping into an established universe knowing nothing about it. However, it doesn't seem all that deep... and so it wasn't hard to catch up. I will probably go back and purchase the other Anomaly games now, so: this game was good enough to widen their audience. If you want to know the details, read on!\n\nGOOD\n- Graphics are very pretty\n\n- Game is quite fun\n\n- The pause mode is great. Takes the twitch gaming out, in favor of tactics and strategy (as a strategy game ought to)\n\n- The background artwork on the levels (there tends to be stuff behind the main game map) is interesting and inventive. Very artistic, and often animated, doing interesting things. It doesn't distract from the game, but sometimes I'd start a level and just look around at the background before starting the mission. Very pretty!\n\n- Music and sound : epic soundtrack with an interesting voice actor as the AI companion, and the battle sounds seemed reasonable for what they're associated with.\n\n\nBAD\n- Towers are repetitive without much to differentiate them. Its not easy to tell their purpose. Form should follow function, but clearly the designers wanted an alien organic machine look. They got that, but at the expense of practicality and interesting tower design\n\n- There is still a twitch gaming element, in that I found myself constantly casting spells, which was annoying and repetitive\n\n- For a strategy game, there's not a lot of strategy. Pretty-much the same strategies work all the time, and can be reused endlessly with little variation. The enemy is very dumb, and I was able to complete almost every level with 0 damage to the base the first time through on normal mode... that doesn't bode well for strategy games. Strategy where you don't really have to think isn't really strategy. I will add that there were a few times where you need to switch strategy up: such as the introduction of aircraft, shock units (etc), but there are really only 6 of these moments in 24 missions. And after you adapt to the new circumstances, you can just go back to grinding away, now with the new strategy.\n\n- No real story. There is a hint at something deeper, but for the most part its just "kill waves of enemies so I can launch the next escape pod."\n\n- Controls can be a bit wonky. I am not sure if this was made as a mobile port or what, but click-drag is the only realistic means to get around the map. The arrow keys pan... very very slowly. And moving the mouse cursor to the edges like in most RTS games is EVEN SLOWER.\n\n- Non-remappable keys ... you'd think in 2015 all games would have remappable controls, but apparently Anomaly Defenders is stuck back in the 90s or so. This is annoying because ... arrow keys for panning? Once again: not the 90's anymore. Use WASD, or at least make it so we can set it to WASD. Secondly: Shift calls the next wave. Better hope you don't get a steam message, because if you Shift+Tab, you might find yourself knee deep in bad-guys. Once again: it would be fine if there were a way to set it to another keymap.\n\n- Enemies are boring : waves of mechs, bomb mechs, fire mechs, different sized mechs, tanks, tanks with turrets, tanks without turrets, tanks with 2 guns on their turret.... (I think you get the idea). For the most part, the enemies seemed uninspired. None were particularly memorable aside from the spider mech and the aircraft, which were pretty cool.\n\n- The meteor level is annoying. Defending a base where random meteors hit doesn't really add that much to a level except annoyance and frustration. If you're going to kill my towers, I prefer that they are destroyed by skill and not some random dice roll. Thankfully this only happened in one level, and the level is otherwise pretty easy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNot bad as a Tower Defense game. Much too easy, with some annoying levels, boring enemies, and some control problems - but otherwise quite good. Its carried especially on the merits of its very pretty explosions and gorgeous backdrops, and the fact that its just very solid gameplay in-general. But then again... tower defense is hard to mess up. Anyway, its fun if you're looking to kill some time. Not really a challenge, but lots of stuff explodes. 7/10","February 1, 2015","true","12.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not bad, but there's really nothing innovative or unique about it. It's a good addition to the series, but not really a notable title in the genre. The interesting thing about Anomaly is that it was reverse TD. You were the attacking mobs and you had to survive the tower defense. That was an interesting twist on the old game that made it more interesting.\n\nAnomaly Defenders is just straight TD with very little to make it interesting. Like I said, it's not a bad game. If you really need to have the full set, I don't think you'll be disapponted with Anomaly 3. If you're looking for a new, different TD game, this isn't it. Try Sanctum 2 or Defense Grid (nothing necessarily "interesting" about DG either, it's just a very solid TD, and in my opinion better than AD).\n\nI keep saying this isn't a bad game, and it really isn't. But due to the fact that it's essentially just an Anomaly skin on top of [any TD game ever], I can't give it a thumbs up. It pains me to give it a thumbs down. I wish I could give it "no thumbs," but I have to choose.\n\nIf somebody I don't know asks me "should I get Anomay Defenders?" my answer is no. It's a non-event in the history of Tower Defense. If you can get it on the cheap (like I did in a recent Humble Bundle), do it.\n\nIf PaulC asks me "should I get Anomaly Defenders?" my answer is yes.

The original idea of Tower Offense as sub-genre to control humans in battles against alien invaders is now completely opposite. In fact, now you are protector of alien homeworld while counterattack is underway. Defend the planet from humans in old fashion way..its time for tower defense !\n\nThere are various titles in Tower Defense genre, they are usually addictive for most of the people but we must admit fact that they are offering rather passive experiance. Anomaly Defenders on the other side brings you experiance where you need to act fast and perhaps be more aggresive then usually. In fact, people scums which are trying to destroy our planet this time will try to be annoying since beside armor and health they will attack and try to breach through your defense so therefor you will need to plan your strategy and have in mind one step ahead, which also prevents your towers to became overpowered.\n\nYour main goal is ofcourse to defend in this case launchpads. Each time when you start campaign you will be able to build abilities in tech-tree for your needs to proced through 24 missions. These are RPG elements which is in fact suprising. At the start of every mission you will get good amount of carusarium which will provides you ability to build towers on tower blocks which are ultimately and only places where you can build them. There are varius sizes of towers with different range for attacks so you will need to choose wisely.\n\nSome missions will have only one entrance point while some will have more including even couple ways through level to get their dirty hands on your launchpad. There are squads or more likely known as waves in which enemy units will appear. By destroying enemy units you will be getting carusarium and energy points where you need to click on bubles during fights to collect points but be careful because by collecting them when you are on maximum limit you will just throw them away, be patient and wait good opportunity . Energy points are for special functions as repair your tower, make them go berserk, sacrifice them in explosions to harm those nasty humans or perhaps use shield for your tower or even throw EMP explosion and disable enemy weapons for limited time.\n\nTech tree will give you abilities to upgrade towers on higher levels and unlock extra features. Interesting side of this game that you will actually need to use your brain little bit more, in fact healing towers is based on time limit so healing them while enemies attacks you will most likely ignore incoming damage and sometimes even heal to maximum health, if you are without energy points to keep them in life there is always option to sell tower and build another one perhaps somewhere further and closer to your touchpad especially if you are fighting through last wave and humans are going strong.\n\nThere is option to pause and speedup game if you are tired of waiting but most of the time you will preffer slower gameplay due to those options and strategies. Some areas are full with incoming asteroids with random impact areas, as they will help you sometimes most of the time they will damage your towers but you are going to be notified and get counter with couple seconds before impact so that you can actually upgrade either heal tower on time.\n\nBeside all that action package which you will get in this game there is and passive side. By unlocking tech-tree you will get harvesters. Those are passive towers without ability to attack but in case that you build them on reserved spots you will be getting carusarium by every couple seconds, amount of carusarium is limited so as every other unit in this game, upgrade will be required. Sometimes by building those harvesters you will lure enemies to go other way around and perhaps suprise them.Building towers behind some objects in fact will act as suprising element and it will get less damage due to non-visibility to enemy units.\n\nAnomaly Defenders has a bright shiny palette, in specific sci-fi tone. The level design and the graphics will get your attention yet one never overpowers or detracts from the other. Levels were created with passion, and there is a good amount of variance between them, which keeps the game visually interesting. Music and sound effects are actually suprisingly well done so it will bring you only more pleasure to relax and enjoy in upcoming challenges.\n\nDespite fact that there are countless tower defense games this one just feels different. It’s an unique experiance with really well covered all aspects in the game for only 10 dollars available on Steam, Mac and Linux.","May 30, 2014","true","2.5"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ave_hl2/recommended/294750/","ave_hl2","aVe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ave_hl2/","282 products in account","Compared to existing Tower Defense games, Anomaly Defenders is a decent one.\n\nThe game twists the original storyline by placing you, the commander, at the side of the machines, as you plan a counterattack against your own kind, humanity, which now can strike the final and fatal blow. Your job is to prevent the 24 launchpads to be destroyed in order to send remaining aliens into space. All of this without any second thoughts, simply to ensure the survival of the machines. How kind of you.\n\nThe game features a bunch of good and proven ideas, with a nice execution. Towers comes from the Anomaly Warzone serie - so you kinda feel at home - and are accessible via a Tech Tree, from which you can buy or resell technologies if you need; along with abilities and improvements (armor, critical damage, energy pool, buying and selling cost).\n\nCaurasaurum is the ingame currency used to buy towers, and Energy can be grabbed on destroyed enemy units to activate special abilities like Repair, Shield, Rage, Sniper...\n\nLike many Tower Defense games, each level is a combination of a tutorial and a puzzle. The game in some extent tries to push you from your comfort zone each time you have found an optimal placement for a tower, or a deadly combination of towers. But anyhow, Anomaly Defender can be reduced to a puzzle even if there is some tension in selecting the right place for towers since they occupy more or less space.\n\nThe strange thing about Anomaly Warzone is that, in spite of its qualities, the gameplay becomes sometimes repetitive, the most intense moment being the beginning of each level where you analyse and plan your towers placement, then simply repair and upgrade them as the human forces grow stronger.\n\nThere is really a radical loss of pacing compared the Warzone serie, in which you have to constantly re-route your squad, run for energy ressources or carefully place abilities like Repair.\n\nThis might be an example of the difference between a game like Anomaly Warzone with a novel and solid core concept that can sustain even a barely good execution ; and a game like Anomaly Defenders who spawns inside an established genre, without an outstanding concept, but with proven ideas and a good execution.","March 10, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is just amazing. You hold off waves of enemies, like usual, but the graphics are so enjoyable, the tech tree is amazing (some strategy required even there) and gameplay fun! The towers have tad different sizes, so tower placement is a bit important, depending on the unit. The enemies can sometimes take the longer route when you "bait" them with an unit at some deposit that collects "money" you use to buy/upgrade units. Oh and sometimes levels have some "special" thing, like meteorites falling everywhere. Better try it out if you find it appealing!\n\nLil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Jdtqhs-3k","August 10, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anomaly Defenders however is a return to the classic tower defense genre and it's not surprisingly at all judging by the way the story evolved in the previous games.\n\nUnfortunately, it has nothing to the tower defense genre and moreover, it has some issues that stopped me from loving this game, no matter how much I struggled to do so.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the game is flawless. The game looks great yet runs smoothly even on older hardware and I was unable to find any bugs (not that I actually looked).\n\nThe gameplay however is where it fails, more or less. The best thing about this is the technology tree. This one is actually well made, easy to understand even for less experienced gamers and offers some interesting features and upgrades.\n\nFrom here on, things go down.\n\nThe game features 24 maps and 3 difficulty levels for each map, each level rewarding the player with a certain amount of technology points. About half of the maps are very well designed and offer some tactical variations and different approaches while the other maps seem chaotic, leaving no chance for tactics and reducing the gameplay to a state of pure brute force with a trial and error approach.\n\nThe towers, while the same towers from the rest of the games, now seem very underpowered and, with a few exception, there is not much difference in what damage they can take and make.\n\nThe ability wheel, that allows you to build, sell or upgrade towers as well as access the abilities seems and can be quite unintuitive when being used in large battles. You can often find yourself selling your tower instead of upgrading it or buying a different tower than the one needed because of the small am very similar tower icons.\n\nOn the other hand, the enemy units, mostly the ones from the other Anomaly games, can seem very overpowered quite often.\n\nThe enemy units are very slow paced when they enter the map but change instantly when they are close to the towers, forcing the player to pause the game to repair/upgrade or use other abilities.\n\nCombining these with the poorly designed maps, you will often find yourself having to choose between towers that prevent the ground units from advancing and those that will prevent the air support units from wracking your towers and base.\n\nAnd as if this wasn't enough, some maps have "random" hazards/treats, like meteorites falling from the sky that will destroy the towers if not repaired on time or lighting strikes that will disable EXACTLY the towers that are firing the advancing enemy units. So much for the random element.\n\nThe game is mostly incredibly easy but some maps that combine all the elements mentioned above, can be ridiculously hard.\n\nIn terms of story and atmosphere the game simply fails, especially if compared to the other Anomaly games.\n\nOverall, the game was a disappointment and far from what I would expect from an Anomaly game or even a tower defense game.\n\nAgain, it would be nice if Steam would have a "MEH" option for reviews. This is one of those games that I cannot down vote but I shouldn't upvote as well. You could give it a try if you have the chance to get it on a sale but don't expect much from it.","March 13","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
