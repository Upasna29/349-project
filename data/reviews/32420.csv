I did like the game but not enough to pay full price.

Once you get past the Games For Windows Live page (which I personally like for the easy gamerscore) and the often frustrating platforming, you get to a fun game that you and a friend can laugh at. It's somewhat akin to the LEGO games in the simple combat and vehicle sequences, but with less brick smashing and coin gathering and more droid slicing and derpy hats. It seems as though the game almost recognizes it's stupidity and embraces it, almost.\nThe only technical error that I encountered was the inability to save my resolution and graphics settings, forcing me to reset them each time I launched the game.\nOverall I'd give this game a 6 out of 10. It succeeds at being what It's trying to be, it's a goofy cheesy clone wars game, but nothing more.","September 6, 2015","true","7.7"," 155 of 211 people (73%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","73","155","211","18","3"

Everyone who is knocking it is too old. It's clearly designed for youth who are fans of the cartoon. My young daughter really enjoys playing co-op together. It's basically like playing through a story arc of the Clone Wars cartoon with most major characters at least making a cameo appearance. You play as a variety of characters throughout the game, both clones and jedi vs. the shows primary villians - especially lots and lots and lots and lots of droid soldiers. That's pretty much like the show though, so no surprise there. You don't go around killing people like in The Force Unleashed, only droids.\n\nUpdate: Beat the game on normal difficulty co-op with my younger daughter. Total time was about 11 hours, but we got less than half of the achievements, in game unlocks, etc. Overall, it's not that bad of a game.\nIf you are an adult fan of the Clone Wars cartoon, I recommend setting the difficulty to Jedi from the start to increase the challenge somewhat. Being designed for youths, you immediately continue with an unlimited number of lives from the exact spot you died while playing (only lose some points for buying unlocks), so there isn't much to worry about like getting stuck later in the game.\n\nAdditionally, we played co-op with X360 controllers, it's likely more comfortable playing this type of game that way than on a keyboard.","November 2, 2014","true","10.6"," 143 of 198 people (72%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","72","143","198","8","0"

Much better value for our money than if we would have rented a movie... It seems that this game has gotten mostly negative reviews, and even if I would have played it alone, or bought it at a higher price, it seems unfair to give it a negative review. It's not a great game, perhaps not even a good game, but it is not bad.\nIt does not excel in any way, and we had some issue with the "game for windows" at first, but it was easily solved, and we both thought we had a fun time playing the game.","January 5","true","4.4"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","50","57","4","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prmaguiar/recommended/32420/","prmaguiar","Shiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prmaguiar/","1410 products in account","Awful.\n\nDespite being a fan of the Star Wars franchise, I never got around to watching The Clone Wars. I certainly appreciate its art style, though, and this game is faithful to it. That's the only good thing about the game, and even then it's rather subjective – some people might not enjoy its looks.\n\nThe story is the same for every piece of Star Wars material, which is to say, disposable at best.\n\nAs for characters... Anakin Skywalker's annoying padawan calling him "Skyguy" every five minutes during the dreadful cutscenes would be enough to put me off. But I persevered, as part of my quest to beat all of my Games For Windows Live titles before that system is shut down (possibly rendering them unplayable forever).\n\nSpeaking of cutscenes, they are often glitched and abruptly interrupted for no reason.\n\nThe gameplay is very, very dull. The combat is boring, especially when you're playing the role of Republic soldiers (in other words, the shooting sections). And even in the hardest difficulty setting, if you "die", you'll just respawn in the same area, without any limits. Perhaps most baffling, though, is the fact that you will face the same boss THREE times. He always uses the same attacks, and you'll always use the same method to beat him.\n\nThere are occasional "puzzles" that were clearly designed with four-year old children in mind. On top of that, Master Yoda will always show up to tell you what to do next or how to play. Like a constant tutorial throughout the game.\n\nIt also has some of the worst platforming sections I have ever gone through... and it has a lot of them. The controls are very imprecise, even when playing with a gamepad. Levels are poorly designed, and the fixed camera angles only makes matters worse. This means you'll be falling to your "death" more often than not when jumping around... but hey, at least there's that immediate respawn, right?","February 5, 2014","false","7.7"," 144 of 243 people (59%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","59","144","243","14","3"

It has many fun aspects to the game i really enjoyed. When i played as one of the Jedi Knights, i had alot of fun swinging my lightsaber through droids on screen.  When i started playing as the Clone Troopers, i refreshed from the change in gameplay. These were some of the good aspects of the game, but they cannot compare to the troubling glitches or bugs that came with it. The fun of playing as Anakin Skywalker quickly disapeared when the jumping mechanics were shown. I found myself stuck on parts of the level for ages because the character would never land where you wanted them to. They would keep missing the ledge by the smallest fraction and i would be sent back to the start. That is the most frustrating glitch in the game and the most seen.\n\nAlso worth mentioning, if you do not have a microsoft live account then you will not be able to save your progress in the levels.\n\nIf you are a fan of the Clone Wars series you might enjoy the feeling of fun pace of the game. But for $19.99, maybe not.  When it is on sale you may get some fun out of it for a while but you may find your self not coming back to it again.\n\nTo put it simply, if this wasn't titled "Star Wars", it wouldn't be in my Steam Library.","January 3","false","1.5"," 31 of 49 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","31","49","3","0"

The problem is that it's a rare occurence when everything works as it should. No camera control creates a terrible environment where you'll spend more time dying trying to figure out the angle to jump than what the actual mission length requires. Controls are somewhat awkward and combat generally becomes the same process. I didn't encounter too many bugs, but when they occured, it was horrible.\n\nOn the bright side though, the game has a fun, typical Star Wars vibe and the plot is actually good. There's the ample amount of foreshadowing for what occurs later in the film series and the voice acting is the exact same as in the TV show Clone Wars.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend that anybody purchase the game unless it's on sale.

The graphics are very close to the CGI animation of the Clone Wars TV Series and has all of the original actors. There are moments where you feel like you're watching an episode of the Clone Wars.\n\nThat said there are some annoyingly frustrating sections where due to camera angles you end up missing jumps for small platforming areas and falling straight down a bottomless pit.

No more. No less. Most of the negative reviewers probably didn't expect this game (and its story) to be that obviously aimed for children and expected a little more, hence the negative reviews. Again, this is no Lego Star Wars which is "officially for children" but an adult can find fun in it too; this game doesn't aim for adults at all.\nWith that said, if you try to have an open mind about it and realize it's not really meant for you, as a game it's not that bad as you'd expect. It's obviously designed to be played with controller instead of keyboard/mouse, for which the controls (and camera) are pretty clumsy. The gameplay reminds me very much of some Playstation 1 platformers (kind of like Jedi Power Battles) and feels a little outdated (although the graphics are decent), but slashing stuff with lightsaber should be enjoyable enough for kids. Despite the level design not being the greatest (sometimes it's not clear what to do or where to go) it plays pretty well. The game is hardly challenging and even on hard difficulty you'll find yourself just swooping through the levels. But again, if you're reading this, this game is probably not meant for you.\n\nI DO recommend it for parents/children (especially if they're Star-Wars-positive), it should be fun enough. Wait for some sale though, it's definitely not worth the full price. And get yourself a controller or two (it can be played either solo or by two players cooperating, which might be pretty fun), keyboard+mouse is playable but very clumsy. In contrary to some reviews, I had no problems at all getting it run on a modern system with Windows 8.1, just installed and played.\nI DO NOT recommend it to more serious gamers who are looking for challenge, deep story or an adequate game, you'll be disappointed. Also, if you're a serious gamer, GFWL can be annoying to you.","May 8, 2015","true","8.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game puts new meaning to the phrase "beating a dead horse". This game is nothing but a pretty label on an empty box (with a pretty penny on the price tag).\n\nRepetitive, easy combat. No real penalty for death whatsoever make the combat seem like a walk in the park. No sweats broken, no tears shed, nothing ineresting at all, really. And to top it off, there are way too many missions. I mean really, WAY too many missions. The combat and platforming are uninteresting enough as it is, but with so many levels, it becomes monotonous as well.\n\nTo add insult to injury, there is no creativity behind the level design. The levels are almost as boring and repetitive as the combat. After about ten minutes of gameplay, you have experienced all of the things this game has to offer. After then, it's just the same ten minutes, over and over. Seriously, if I wanted excitement, I'd be better off watching paint dry.\n\nAlso, this game's platforming mechanics are an utter disgrace. You jump towards a ledge. You then either catch the ledge, or miss it. No real apperant reason much of the time.\n\nAdditionally, the camera angles of this third-person "action" game are atrocious. Making the already unpredictable platforming nigh-impossible.\n\nVery dry and uninteresting voice-acting and storyline serve as yet another nail in the coffin of this game.\n\nSeriously, don't buy it. It's nothing but a scam for your precious money.\n\n1/10","December 22, 2013","false","0.3"," 42 of 82 people (51%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","51","42","82","10","4"

That was the fact that they brought in a writer and several voice actors from the Clone Wars cartoon. So the atmophere of the game is a flawless imitation of the Clone Wars cartoon. The characterization is dead on to fans of the show (including, true to the cartoon's form, the snarkiest Obi-Wan Kenobi ever to be seen in any fictional work). The story isn't brilliant per se, but it certainly feels like an odd playable episode of the television show, which allowed me to hate it less than it deserves to be hated.\n\nAfter a nice opening cutscene, it all goes downhill fast when you're given control for the first time, and you spend five minutes trying to find, learn, and understand the ludicrous controls. As you're learning you are assaulted with poor graphics, unexciting combat, bland levels, poor camera angles, and possibly the worst platforming I have seen in any game ever - certainly the worst in any 21st century game. Further, I started the game controlling both characters at once (multiplayer mode), which was incredibly ungainly, and the rest of the game was so bad that I assumed this was just part of the awfulness and slogged through the first hour of the game trying to play one character with each hand. It got so annoying eventually that I googled around and saw that oh, there was a single player option that the menus made absolutely no effort to direct me to.\n\nIf you got this as part of the Star Wars package, you can safely skip it unless you're a Clone Wars superfan. If you're considering buying it by itself, save yourself a headache and don't.","December 12, 2015","false","7.2"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","51","19","37","5","0"

This game is not just bad, it is Terribad. Capital T and all. This game is the kind of bad, that people on youtube make money off of for showing off. It is a freakshow of terribleness. The control scheme is awful and when mixed with the fixed camera angles, you have NO depth perception or sense of angles. Most of the time you are jumping off cliffs for a simple jump. Using a controller fixes this issue only slightly. This is the first game i have touched that has went so far to make a tutorial, and forgt to teach you stuff. I had to look up how to beat the tutorial boss, because i did not understand that the game requires double jumping to its tiny gun, to balance on it. Which i tried before i even looked it up. On a keyboard its REALLY hard to tell these things. Deaths in the game have LESS punishment then the Lego series. But your hud is designed for taking punishment. The design makes no sense. This game, in all of its areas is not for a small childs as claimed. No my friends, this is just really lazy craftmanship. No care or love went into this game at all. I have no clue HOW IN THE NINE LAYERS OF HELL they managed to make the game look so amazing. Its sad that its wasted on the non-existant enviroment. Nothing pretty to look at. Some cutscenes have ... decent-ish.. chit-chat. but as soon as the scene ends, your treated to the awful dialogue of the ingame banter. If you do dare touch this title, you will never want to hear the words "Skyguy" ever again, as it will only lead to memories of these horrible wretched moments. This game is one of the worst titles i have played in a very long time. I should have looked at the reviews before i threw my 5$ at this thing. I love bad games, but a lazy game is unforgiveable.","May 5, 2014","false","0.4"," 23 of 46 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","23","46","0","0"

Controls are awful. It's like the Star Wars Lego games where it's sort of a blast-em up 3D platformer, but virtually unplayable playing by yourself with a mouse and keyboard, since the camera can't be rotated and your "helper" padawan keeps killing things that you're supposed to use in order to progress to the next area. If the controls aren't enough, Yoda keeps popping up on screen trying to give you hints about what to do, and he comes up every 30 seconds if you don't do it (like if your padawan keeps hindering you). If you thought the owl in Zelda was bad, he's got nothing on Yoda.\n\nOn top of all this you need a Games For Windows Live account just to save your progress.

The controls did me in. It also made me think of the Lego star wars game not bad but also not my cup of tea. my friends liked it .  There are better games out there. This one can leave you upset not really what you want when playing a game. it is somewhat easy to play if you get past the controls no depth so no real story or plot to keep up with. 4/10 i felt it was rushed if they had just put a little more TLC in it. $19.99 is way to much get it on sell if you have to buy it.","November 11, 2014","false","0.2"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

However, considering I can't even start a campaign, I resignedly have to go against this one. If I could do a bit of gameplay, then I could review that. Somehow after getting a new and better computer this game doesn't even function as a menu simulator- it never boots up. I hate to say it, cuz I love the Clone Wars, but this isn't remotely worth a purchase for the simple fact that you may not even be able to play it no matter what you do.","July 16, 2014","false","0.3"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"
