Mainly due to tacky graphics, poor voice overs and some non responsive lags. I have to end up using the solve button for puzzles as they offer no hint buttons. I am a avid HOG player and this one is a big miss in my book.","May 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Requires 2 play throughs to get all in game achivements. More adventure than hidden object. Overall - Good fun.\n\nPros:\nGood Puzzles\nEasy Gameplay\n\nCons:\nAchivements are not linked to steam\nWeird story\n\n\n","May 15","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
