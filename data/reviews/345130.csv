I have no ties or links to the development of this game).  This game's controls are very close to the old school Asteroids, a favorite arcade game from my childhood back in the early 1980's.\n\nI am offering a 'high score' contest, and whoever can post video gameplay of the highest score by next Sunday, March 8, at 7pm Eastern US time, will win a Steam copy of 'Zombie Army Trilogy'.. not yet released (launches on Steam on 3/6/15) with a value of $44.99 USD!!\n\nThis game plays great either with your mouse (no keyboard at all) -OR- a controller.  With the mouse, it's actually pretty easy to control your ship.  Left mouse button is fire, Right mouse button is your thrust, and the middle mouse button is your bomb which you'll need to conserve and use sparingly and in those do-or-die moments.  With a controller, you'll only use the left stick to point your ship, buttom button is fire, right-most button is thrust, and top-most button is your bombs.\n\nThis game has two game modes.. An objective mode where you clear waves of rocks and enemy spaceships that get progressively harder and an endless challenge mode where you the enemies and rocks never stop, you just keep playing trying to achieve a high score and the game ends when you eventually run out of lives.\n\nSadly, high scores for this game are only kept on your local computer.  Missing a internet based high score list to compete against would have been a nice feature, and makes this game feel like it's missing something important.\n\nMore and higher graphics resolution options (especially for widescreen monitors) should also have been here.\n\nI do love how enemy ships, even early on have pretty good AI and will try and flank you from multiple angles, and might even turn away from you and "run" at times.\n\nAll-in-all, this is one of the best Asteroid re-makes I've ever played, even though the graphics are certainly no where in the ballpark of shinier options like Geometry Wars and Super Stardust.\n\nEven with the missing universal high scores and graphics options (which I hope the developer adds later) .. I give this game an 8.5 out of 10.   For $5 USD, it delivers a solid arcade action game that would make it's grandfather, arcade Asteroids of 1979 very proud.","March 1, 2015","true","4.8"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","17","29","3","0"

Grafix and sounds are well below average. If you have ever played Stardust or Super Stardust you can't enjoy this, as this feels so old and dated. There are lot of better options, like the Stardust games that have been around for decades.","May 12","false","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Controls are a little annoying when it comes to navigation but overall not bad. I can't say this is better or worse than Asteroid or the 3,532 other space shooters, but it's decent enough.\n\nCampaign has 30+ missions where the difficulty ranges greatly. I personally wouldn't pay $5 since they didn't really innovate or expand the genre.\n\nWorth $1\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

Having to switch between mouse and controller while navigating the menu sucks.\n\nI wish the controls were more like Asteroids and you rotated your ship rather than moving in the direction you point the controller.\n\nMaybe I'm too oldschool, as I seem to be the only one not to like the controls.\n\nI did receive the game for free from the Giveaways thread on the Steam forums, so I can't complain.\n\n","May 31, 2015","true","0.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I already put in maybe 6 good hours, it's fun, the game is hard, the difficulty comes from actually flying your ship since you use thrusters and the only way to slow your momentum is to fire the thrusters in the opposite direction of your current momentum otherwise you keep sliding all over the place. You can shoot asteroids which is the main objective in the game, little alien enemy ships spawn sometimes throughout the game that you need to focus down, some of them shoot lazer beams at you that you can shoot and homing missiles that you can shoot, some of them throw out death beam lazers that you can't shoot that you just have to move to avoid, and there's occasionally a boss fight like what's in the video preview for the game the really big ships that take up half the screen. It is a great game, i was pleasantly surprised by it, I recommend, if it looks like you might enjoy this by watching the preview video I recommend trying it, it's fun.","July 22, 2015","true","12.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Discover this amazing remake of the classic arcade game Asteroids! Dark Matter recreates the excitement and frantic gameplay of the title that made history. In 1980, Asteroids was one of the most commercially successful games that helped to establish video games as a lasting entertainment medium. Now, embark on 30 various intergalactic missions in Campaign mode or opt to survive an endless attack in Challenge mode. - Highly Recommended!","July 28, 2015","true","1.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

First a big foot slaps up on the scream for the companies logo of what appeasrs to be flying poop of all shapes and sizes.   So, I start up a campaign and start firing away at this floating poo and all be the firing sounds like terds going into a toilet.   Then trying to figure out the controls which wasn't WASD I get pop up tutorial and thrust uncontrablly into the flying poo while firing terd noises and collide with the upmost and grossest plop noise like more poo hitting the bottom of a sceptic.\n\nNow if you've ever played Asteroids on Atari then picture than with flying crap on the scream with toilet noises to match and you get Dark Matter.\n\nAny game that reminds me of my sewage experience with a name to match with flying terds and noises too match is thumbs down.    I should be paid for the nightmares about terds I will have I am forever mentally damaged from this game.\n\nBottom line:\nIt's a terd of a game.....LITERALLY.\n","September 5, 2015","false","0.1"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","6","15","3","0"

You get some powerups, but it doesn't add much to the game, you're still playing Asteroids.  There are some other ships, too, but the focus is more on killing asteroids.  You can play Asteroids online in a web browser now, for free, so there's really no purpose to this game existing on Steam.\n\nGraphics are slightly improved over 1979's Asteroids.   Not much, however, and it's the year 2016, so one would have thought 45 years of development in the silicon age should yield better improvements.   Not for these guys!  No widescreen support, no support for high res monitors (not even 1080p).\n\nFailing both gameplay and technical categories, there's no way at all to recommend this game.   If you like the genre, try out Star Control 2, or any number of better alternatives.","May 19","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
