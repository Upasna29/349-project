There are a LOT of guns, usually you can dual weild them too!  It's fun to shoot stuff, the animations are great, overall the graphics and 3d models are great.  I love the voice acting and humor.  Most of the levels are well done and look fantastic.  Straight forward linear no BS gameplay, just run n gun and shoot the hell out of ANYTHING and EVERYTHING.

It follows the story of Caleb on the main story. Gideon rises and tries to take over the world and kill Caleb while he is finding a way to ressurect his friends called the Chosen, decent story. But on most machines on Windows 8 the game performs horribly! But there is a widescreen fix, but I recommend turning the settings down alot to get a playable experince.

Run the game in windows 98 compatibility mode and as administrator (found this info on GOG).\n\nOKAY, OKAY I ADMIT IT, I'M BIASED AGAINST THIS GAME. BUT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY LIKE IT. MAYBE JUST SKIP MY REVIEW AND JUST WATCH SOME GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE lol.\nhttp://youtu.be/o3z0spt1RFI\nI played this a game quite a bit years ago i.e. when it first came in 1998. I actually started off with the demo. Yes I did play it today and it still the same I've clocked multiple times so I know the game well. The game is okay but nothing special, it disappointing unfortunately.\n\nOkay yes it is sequel to Blood. However I really don't think the game is as good. I think that because of the standard of 3D games at the time i.e. low poly models that sort of thing, making the transition to 3D didn't really benefit the blood series of games. In fact if you don't count 'Nightmare levels' expansion for this. This was the last blood game. And personally I think it that's they tried to do it in 3D to early on. The first game in 2D actually looks better than this. Just compare the first level of game to each. The first Blood had Caleb rising from the  grave in a cool mortuary and traversing through a funeral parlour. Blood II has you walking down the carriages of a train. It cannot get more corridor like and linear, and that level only goes for about one minute if you just run down it. Yes the textures in the first game are pixelly but you actually see the detail such as text clearly. In blood II textures look like a painting whose colours have run because the canvas was soaked in water; everything is a blurred smear. The models in Blood II look so much worse than the 2D sprites in the original game. Compare the Tchernobog 3D model in Blood II you find in the museum to the 2D version you find at the end of Blood. The sprites had so much more detail in them including their animations. I mean blow an enemy up in Blood and you witness them being torn asunder in an animation formed by a series of sprites. But blood II they will just be replaced by the crappy low poly gibs and blurry blood spatters. The first Blood game has so much more detail; finer detail. Environments in that game looked like they had a lot of effort into them. Maybe it in Blood 2 it is not so much that effort wasn't put into the game, more that PCs that people had at the time weren't that powerful so higher detailed 3D models and detailed levels weren't really feasible yet let alone the standard.\n\nEven the one liners from Caleb and other player characters are not the same. Yes it sound like Caleb. I think it is actually a different voice actor maybe. But the lines are less black humour and more just sadistic.\n\nAnyway it's not all bad. Some of the gun play is actually satisfying, then again some is pretty lame and it's hard to control fine control your character movement. Years ago, not now lol I played the demo over and over again. Using the assault rifle felt pretty good. I'm recommending that people can enjoy this but it's just an inferior substitute for the original game which is also now available on steam. If you have to choose between them play that instead.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 14, 2014","true","0.2"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","20","32","0","1"

It's a classic late 90's shooter (with the no reloading thing and the endless copy paste enemies). All the ideas in this game are cool, it even has some easter eggs.. not many of them are funny but it's a bunch of cool references. Caleb himself is an anti-hero, You could compare him to Alucard From Hellsing, Not caring for common people and is just wants Blood and Vengence. (Personally the repressed, evil insanity thing really appeals to me, even if it's a Protagonist or 'The Good Guy').\nThe ending left room for a Sequel.. as in the Developers would have had the option to if they wanted, It'd be totally okay if they just left things as they are.\n..Oh Yeah, don't complain about the game's realism.. I've read some of the other reviews on here, "Everything Explodes, even the trash bags!!" It's a 90's game dude.. Quake 2 was very similar in that way, shoot a dead body with a pistol and it explodes.\n\n*Sigh* This game is basically my childhood, I found it when i was 7 in my Mother's computer game rack, and had a blast (lost the CD as the irresponsible child I was).\nAs I've played through on this steam release, the game has ended with a crash, within 20 minutes, 3 times.\nI bought the game KNOWING FULL WELL that on steam it has this issue (others having the screen flicker problem).\nI bought this game along with the previous Blood game to support them, as dumb as that sounds, I had the slight hope that they might update the game with at least a small patch, I know that Jace Hall tried to get the first game with HD, re-released for Free, but the ones who own the rights to the franchise were having financial issues, I don't think they were keen on giving away an asset, even though jace would have paid for the HD re-release himself.\nI hope I at lease supported this game a little.. Even though it was only $4.99.\n\nEdit: I recently got Windows 10 and now the steam version of Blood 2 has framerate issues as well as the normal issues, causing the game to slow down every few seconds (even in the main menu) well below 20 frames per second. running in compatability mode does not help.","September 4, 2014","true","3.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

It is a little of both, with respect to the time it was created. It would not be fair to compare it to current games, of course, but even in comparison to games of the same era it stands back a little. There is no other game I can remember where the opponents are that stupid. One can hardly call that "AI". Even a Pacman ghost has more AI than the Cabalco zombies. Rendered cutscenes are embarrassing at best, and the storyline is more than questionable. On the other hand, the game features nice graphics and effects, and has some funny moments. Somehow, once in a while, playing it again is actually quite fun. But eventually I "grew" up with that game and it brings back memories. That is the only reason to replay at all.\nI certainly would not recommend the game to anyone who isn't already familiar with the Blood gameset. And now for the main reason why I cannot recommend the game at all: it is technically close to unusable.\nBlood II used to become unstable even back in the old days if you owned a PC "too powerful". Apparently the developers have put their engine timing a little on the cheap side, and nothing has been changed about this at all to make it more compatible to current platforms. Actually you will buy the same binaries that were on the original game CD back in 1998! The Steam client does not even have to be running so the binaries obviously literally weren't changed a bit. And you better don't use the Steam client to launch the game at all becuase it is usually not running in an Admin context, so it will not apply compatibility mode which is a mere joke... the game will crash almost instantly.\nWhile on some machines (including mine) there is still a chance to get it working (e.g. by setting the compatibility mode to XP SP3 and running the game as Administrator directly from the installation folder), you should anticipate at least one crash in 10 minutes of gameplay at random times, so remember to save frequently... very frequently.\n\nSo this is a really bad strategy for remarketing. I would expect a software provider to do what is necessary to restore compatibility to current hardware before a game goes for sale. If I had known in advance, I could just have used the Blood II CD that I already owned (purchased 1999!).\nSteam did a nice job getting Duke3D running thanks to excellent DosBox integration. The Blood I package is already a bit screwed up because no link is created to run the setup.exe you need to map keys, set video resolution etc... if you are not familiar with DosBox, you won't get very happy. Seems to me they are just squeezing some dollars out of reminiscent fools like me without actually caring much about the quality delivered. Too bad. So the best experience for these old games is running them on the machine they were built for, if you still have one that works.","November 4, 2014","false","0.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Long ago, back when i was about 5, doom and star wars battlefront were my favourite games to play. Soon, I discovered a game called "Blood 2: The Chosen". My little autistic mind conjured demons, red to be the colour of choice, and scares all around. AND HO BABY WAS I NOT DISAPPOINTED. Caleb practicly became my personal hero, while the master cheif and COD were getting unworthy praise.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CornishGamerHen/recommended/299050/","CornishGamerHen","Cornish Gamer Hen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CornishGamerHen/","218 products in account","Blood II Review\nBlood II is simply abysmal. Don’t even buy it when discounted. And yes, I have played the game through and multiplayer.\n\nBlood 1 was a fantastic 2.5 d shooter, and I had the pleasure of replaying it last year. It still stands up great. Blood II doesn’t live up to its predecessor.\nI don’t blame Monolith for the quality of this game – it was rushed for a Halloween release date, along with development on Shogo happening simultaneously. It is kind of sad that a lot of promised features weren’t included – this game looked a lot more promising before release. The new patches fix a lot and add some stuff, but it doesn’t really save this game.\n\nCons:\n\nLet’s start with the cutscenes. They are unskippable, which is bad because the story is horrible. Cutscenes  start in random places. For example, while Caleb is standing on an escalator, he has a conversation with Gidgeon as the escalator slowly moves him away from Gideon until they are talking to each other through walls, and this is at the very beginning of the game.\n\nThe voice acting is absolutely HORRIBLE. Seriously. The NPCS are annoying, say very dumb and random things. Caleb has turned from a badass to a weirdo. When lit on fire, he will scream about long after the fire is gone. He will randomly laugh while killing. It seems that the developers also had no idea what voice or accent he should use, as it changes throughout the game.\n\nHe also randomly asks for the “Pain to go away” or something while he’s taking damage. It’s so weird and out of place that it breaks any immersion, not that you should have any, and it makes you feel all uncomfortable, like you’re playing an angsty teenager and not a hell raising badass.\n\nIf you’ve ever played Shogo, another game by Monolith, the blood and gibs look roughly the same. However, this really doesn’t fit the serious (I guess? Its hard to tell the tone of this game) tone and realistic art direction of this game, and it fit Shogo being a cartoony shooter. (Unlike Blood II, Shogo is very fun and innovative.)\n\nThe Life Seed and hearts look the same. What do they do? Whats the difference? I don’t like it when games hold your hand but this is just confusing/lazy. I mean yeah the wiki exists, but still.\n\nA lot of the stuff in the environment is destructible. You can destroy washing machines, garbage cans and other junk. This is cool, but a Soda Machine will explode and take half your health. What gives?\n\nLevels are linear and lame, and lack the interesting design and just interesting places of Blood 1. Grey and brown falling apart city. Woo. I’d rather play Kingpin if I wanted that.\n\nMusic. Like Shogo, Blood II attempted adaptive music, music that adjusts to situations. This results in annoying jingles playing randomly and no consistent atmosphere due to transitions between combat and walking stuff.\n\nAlso, the music is just horrible. Its dischordant garbage and the main menu uses pistol shots as a weird percussive side thing that doesn’t fit with the music.\n\nTacky talking about video games in a video game xD joke is present and very cringeworthy\n\nwhy does the launch menu have a very loud gunshot noise upon opening\n\nThis game doesn’t know if its serious or edgy or funny.\n\nPros:\n\nThe HUD is actually really nice. The display is easily visible and minimalistic, the oxygen bar underwater is small and fits well, and is easily visible.\n\nTransition from combat and back. It doesn’t feel like Quake, but it doesn’t feel like Half Life either.\n\nThe graphics are actually really cool and nice to look at.  Lithtech rocks.\n\nThe Blood community is great. Multiplayer is fun.\n\nTech wise, its easy to work with and works great on later machines. I haven’t had any troubles, then again I play older games for fun so it may not be as easy for others.\n\nI give it like, a 3 out of 10 at the most. And that’s generous. It’s like eating a tub full of snow logs, but without the rush.","March 6, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","2"

The most galling bug is random termination - go forward, blast away a couple of NPCs, round the next corner and boom! back to the desktop without any explaination whatsoever.\n\nGranted this game hasn't been ported towards more recent platforms (not that XP is "recent" by any measure of the term) but even trying to launch with any compatibility options enabled results in an unlaunchable game. To recap: random program quits when playing without compatibility, and unable to get beyond the launcher if playing with compatibility enabled.\n\nIf lith (and/or successors) can fix at least this bug I'll reconsider this review, but that's a fairly big "if" at this point.","November 6, 2014","false","0.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

At $10 I would be incensed.\n\nIf you can get the game to work at all, it's unstable, slow, and looks terrible, even for 1998--no work was done to improve compatibility for modern systems.

It doesn't feel the same as the first one or have what made it so perfect, but it's still a very very good, fun, and challenging game.\n\nI don't know why this steam version has so many bad reviews?\nWhat the hell, I have a windows 7 running a GTX 650 2gb, the game is running perfectly fine 1600x900 resolution.\nIf it doesn't work and you're using a windows 8 or 10 what do you expect? both OS have terrible TERRIBLE support for almost any game.\nIt works fine through the disc version and this/gog versions on vista and 7, and everything under.\nIm pretty sure it wont work on 8 or 10 becuase come on, it's an 18 year old game for christ's sake give it some slack instead of complaining, the game's updates have been long abandoned so it's not surprising to me if the developers haven't done anything revently to fix the problems.\n\nIf you're planning on using a computer for gaming, stick with windows 7.\n\nI'd say give this game a go if you are able to get it running.\nIt's very addicting, satisfying and challenging.\nI still prefer the first one but this one isn't bad at all.","February 15","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very Disappointed I must say because Im a big fan of these games. Touchwood, I did however get 'Blood: One unit whole blood' working ok. That seems to be running smooth enough so far and is very enjoyable to play. But my advice for anyone who is downloading this game is this; this is only for running well on older computers (windows 95,  98, XP, mac os9, etc) and unless you are lucky enough to be very tech savy about it, it is sure to not work for you on any newer device and you will be waisting your money.","February 13","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
