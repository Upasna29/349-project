As you play the game you will get more efficient each play through as you learn more about how the game works and what strategies are good in the early mid and late game.\n\nPros:\n+ Sound Track is on Point\n+ Visual Style is appealing\n+ Proggression is strong\n+ Extremely Difficult, forcing you to adapt\n+ Money is your health and you can't hold an infinite amount of money\n\nCons:\n- Lack of story\n- Horse Stamina (When your kingdom gets massive it's extremely annoying to stop and recover stamina)\n- Lack of Late game monsters (There are essentially 3 monster types)\n\nQuestionable Design Decisions:\n= Extremely Fast Day and NIght Cycles\n= Only One Wave of monsters per Night. Becomes kind of exploitable\n= Limited to building 4 knights (2 per side) Allowing more knights could have enabled more difficult attacks from the\nmonsters and more preperations by the player.\n\n= The only way to get new people to your Kingdom is to hire them at camps. The system limits expansion speed but  causes the player to constantly run back and forth accross the map to recruit new people.\n\nOVERVIEW:\nSimplistic game that is worth the money.\n\nOne word of advice. Don't stand too close to your catapults.\n\n*EDIT*\nTL/DR\nWorker AI and Archer Accuracy is intentional and well balanced (In my opinion)\nRead About what I have to say about it below\n\nA lot of people with negative reviews are complaining about bad AI of workers and bad aim of archers. I'm not sure what the devs planned for the game but I see the "bad" AI as intentional. Basically if you give a worker or workers a job they will mindlessly try to complete the job. People complain that this is stupid because workers will go out in the middle of the night to their deaths until the project is complete. I see this as a positive thing. Say you desperately need to repair a torn down wall right as the day turns to night. Would you rather your workers stand in the safety of your kingdom or go and repair the wall as you told them to. If you plan out the jobs you give to your workers you shouldn't have a problem with all your workers going out at night to their doom to chop down a tree.\n\nWow that was a lot of stuff. But I'm not done yet.\n\nOn to the topic of Archers and their terrible aim.\nI think Archers are meant to be inaccurate so that when they hunt during the day they don't bring in so much gold as to break the early game. A lone Archer is not very powerful, but as you recruit more people, the relentless volleys of arrows released by 15+ archers is hard to beat. Sure one archer can miss an enemy 5 times in a row but 10 archers will easily dispatch exponentially more enemies then a small group can. What I'm trying to say is that the game is balanced around recruiting. Expanding and not destroying ecampments so that you can recruit constantly. The more archers you have the more powerful your kingdom is. Rapid and early Recruitment is better than expansion because people are power. There is a good saying in Kingdom. "If your not recruiting your losing"\n\nI just want to say that by no means is this game perfect but I just think it is necessary to call attention to down votes based on things that aren't really negatives. But after all the beauty of the review system is people can post their opinions and no one is right or wrong.","October 26, 2015","true","16.8"," 641 of 680 people (94%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","94","641","680","33","20"

If you read other reviews, you probably have a good idea what the good part of the game is, nice art, awesome soundtrack (first time I ever bought a game OST, and not regretting it one bit). These are the two things I think everyone can agree about.\n\nThen it gets more tricky. The gameplay isn't for everyone. It's literally discover everything for yourself. including how your own guys behave, even how your own horse behaves.\nThe real problem can come from when you don't figure some things out (like how to keep your horse running or how to make your dudes not suicide themselves constantly) and then give up thinking the devs didn't think of that and write review claiming the game is unfinished or lacking.\n\nOn the other hand, simply reading a guide after 5 hours of play, is basically ruining the discovery experience, so in my opinion if you want to enjoy the game try to not look up too many things (or maybe just ask a simple singe question in the forums instead).\n\nNow, that being said, another big deterrent can be the lack of endgame content. (It needs to be said though, that the devs are working on adding more stuff (for free), so that might not be true anyore in a few months.)\nFor me, it took me over 10 hours to beat the game the first time I think, and after that, there where achievements for doing it quick and for enduring long. The speedrunning aspect I really liked, but the endurance aspect (trying to survive as long as you can) is really lacking atm. Once you're set up there's not much to do for 30-50 days, cause you're defenses are just that good.\nSo if you really enjoy building up a large empire and surviving a long time, this game is in it's current stage definitely not for you (imo).\nMe personally, I really enjoy the speedrunning aspect of the game, so trying over and over to finish the game quicker and quicker is really fun for me and is mostly what kept me going for the last 25 hours or so. (Especially since people keep getting quicker and quicker :D)\nIt also means that one has to learn more and more details about the game mechanics, which I really like too. I've played over 40 hours and still learn new stuff.\n\nBut even without doing speedruns, I think the game offers enough content to be worth the money, unless you basically spoiler yourself with guides before you even start (at which point it's getting a bit boring and mechanical, as the normal playthrough isn't that dificult once you understand most mechanics).\nA big fun aspect of the game is losing horribly a lot and then learning more and more how stuff works and then at some point you just easily beat it using all your hard gained knowledge and it feels really good. But if you just look up everything, that sense of achievement will never happen and the game will probably feel a bit bland.\n\nTwo last negative points I want to mention, one is a bug the other a framerate problem. There is still a bug that can break the game a little. Like it can happen that you win, but you don't get the victory and all your dudes stop working. If you don't know that this is a bug it can get quite frustrating. The first time I actually beat the game this happened and I didn't realize it was not supposed to happen, so I spent another 20 days trying to figure out how to win until someone in the forums exaplined to me that this is a bug. (If that happens to you, just exit and start again, and it should put you before the bug happens and you should be fine from there on).\nThe framerate issues "luckily" only happen later on (say day 60 and upwards and usually only during blood moon nights where a lot of monsters appear), so if there wasn't an achievement for surviving 100 days most people would probably never experience it. But there is. And they do. Regardless of how good your computer rig is it seems.\n\nI want to end with saying I had a quite magical time with this game. I bought it right when it came out and a lot of people were streaming it at that point. Since there weren't any guides available at this time it created a very unqie atmosphere, where I would hop from stream to stream watching a bit, seeing what others might have figured out that I haven't, sharing some small tips here and there myself. It really reminded me of the earlier days of gaming, when you couldn't just look up everything online but went to friends places shared and small discoveries with each others. That's something I haven't experienced in over a decade and I probably won't in quite a while. So I just want to end by shouting a big "thank you" to the devs for creating this marvelous experience with their game and I stay curious to see where they take it from here.\n\nTL;DR : If you enjoy being a scientist, testing stuff, doing things to see what happens, learn from that, be willing to accept to fail a few times until you get it right, enjoy atmospheric pixel art and great soundtrack the this game might really be for you.\nIf you want to expand and grow an empire and survive a long time, don't enjoy to figure stuff and gameplay mechanics out for yourself, then you might give this game a pass (at least for now). There is more content coming, so maybe come back in 6 months and see how the game has developed by reading the latest news and content updates and see what people have to say then.\n\nAnyway, hope this review helped give a good voerview about the good and bad aspects of the game. Please thumbs up if you find it helpful as well, so others can benefit from the reivew too :)","November 9, 2015","true","47.3"," 279 of 298 people (94%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","94","279","298","15","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/recommended/368230/","el_kemosabe","El Kemosabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/","1115 products in account","Introduction\nKingdom is a 2D, side-scrolling strategy game where you take on the role of king or queen of a kingdom (I’ll just refer to your character as king from now on for simplicity). As king it’s your job to help your kingdom grow as well as protect said kingdom from the evil forces lurking deep in the forest. All you have is your crown and an empty coin sack. Collect coins throughout the world and spend them on upgrades for you kingdom, don’t be afraid to use them all but be aware, the loss of your crown means the loss of everything.\n\nPresentation\nKingdom has a truly beautiful pixel art style throughout. There’s really not much to say here other than it really does look fantastic. The only UI elements in the game is the coin sack (visible when collecting or spending coins) and the empty coin slots that appear when you’re next to something that can be purchased to show you how much it costs.\n\nGameplay\nI’d just briefly like to say I won’t cover much past what you discover in the first half an hour or so in this section of my review. One of Kingdom’s main ‘selling-points’ is that you’re given next to no information about the game and so it’s very much about discovering how to do different things by yourself.\n\nYou walk through your kingdom while mounted on a horse, collecting coins from your people and then using those coins to bring more workers to your kingdom or to build/upgrade structures. You then have to defend your kingdom from attacking enemies. That is, effectively, the entire game. Of course it’s not quite so straightforward.\n\nIn the early days of a game there’s very little threat to your kingdom from what I like to call the dark forces lurking in the forest (we’ll call them monsters from now on). Without much threat from the monsters this really is the best time to get a solid foundation for your kingdom laid down. While you won’t have the resources to build the more advanced structures you’ll be able to build basic guard towers and basic wooden walls to keep the monstrous onslaught at bay. But what good are defences if you have no one to build them or man them? Well I’m glad you asked! To the left and right of your kingdom’s main building you’ll find many things including small encampments with people. These people will come work for you in your kingdom for the small fee of one gold coin. Returning to your kingdom you’ll want to buy the necessary tools for them to do the job you desire. Need more builders? Buy some hammers from the vendor in your village. Need more archers? Buy some bows from the vendor in your village! You get the idea.\n\nNow things aren’t going to be this easy forever. The game gets progressively more difficult with the passing of each day and after just a couple of days you’ll be facing monsters looking to steal whatever they can get their horrible little hands on!\n\nAs I eluded to, there is a fair bit more in the game but I wouldn’t want to spoil it for prospective players but fear not, there is more to the game than I’ve already mentioned.\n\nYou can probably guess from how I’ve written about the gameplay that I’ve enjoyed playing the game, and I have. However, Kingdom did start to feel quite monotonous to me later in the game. Sure the difficulty is ramped up so there’s more pressure on you to build a village capable of fighting off the monsters and protecting the kingdom as a whole but Kingdom effectively descends into you doing the exact same thing each and every day. Perhaps I’m expecting too much from a game with a pretty simple premised and I imagine a lot of people will disagree with me on this but I don’t want to spend each in game day doing the same route to collect money from my people and then spending that money in the exact same way.\n\nAudio\nKingdom’s audio department is truly fantastic. The sound effects throughout the game are all fantastic but what really makes this game’s audio shine is the fantastic soundtrack, some of which can be found on ToyTree Music’s YouTube channel. They really nailed the soundtrack for this one.\n\nMiscellaneous There is a win condition in the game though I’m not 100% sure what it is since the devs are very secretive about it and only three people have actually managed to beat the game.\nAs far as I can tell your character is completely random, I was told on the forums by someone (not a dev) that you can change your banner/character at the beginning of the game but I couldn’t figure out how to actually do that.\nThe game world is randomly-generated each time you play.\nAt the beginning of each game you’re not able to fully explore your kingdom but as you expand your village to cover more land how far you can explore increases.\nThere is a free flash version of the game available, as far as I know this is just a much simpler version of the Steam game so even if you play the flash game the Steam version is still worth picking up.\nYou have no control over the positioning of your workers, this really only effects the archers as you'll often end up with one side being defensively stronger than the other.\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nKingdom is a great 2D, side-scrolling strategy game with a fantastic pixel art style, fun gameplay and lots to discover. While I don’t think it has bucket-loads of replayability it’s certainly enjoyable for several hours and is well worth your time and money.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","October 21, 2015","true","8.1"," 217 of 271 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","217","271","9","7"

This game is so beautiful, it has an original central mechanic and it's so full of promise. But, as it is, it's just a frustrating mess to actually play- which was the chief problem of the original free online version, as well. The friendly AI is not quite as stone stupid as in the original, but with the more complicated mechanics of the new version the outcome is about the same- your greatest enemy in this game is your allies.\n\nFor example, there are now catapults in the game, operated by the new builders. Catapults are very strong weapons, but they attack slowly and need a builder to reset them in-between attacks. Once a catapult is constructed, your builders will move it to your outermost walls, and move it again further out if new outermost walls are erected. So, hey, let's say you have a strong inner citadel with palisades on the outskirts. Guess where your builders will put your catapults? Where they are most vulnerable! What if your outermost walls are destroyed? No, the builders will not then move the catapult back inside the walls, it's just stuck out there in the open forever. There is no way you can control any of this. Guess you have to give up layered defenses if you want to use catapults!\n\nSo, you give up having perimeter palisades so you can have your catapult behind your strong inner wall, and the horde is coming. Does the catapult wait until the mass of demons is in range for a strong crowd control shot? Nope! It fires the moment the first little lead peon touches its range, and almost always then misses hitting anything at all as its shot drops behind the front runner and ahead of the main assault. Well, that's okay really, the catapult can just fire again, right? Ah, but it's not so easy, now you have to wait for the catapult to be reset. And funny thing, while your archers are now finally smart enough to stand by your walls at night in order to defend them, your builders... not so much. So, seeing as they wander aimlessly even in the middle of a siege, it's anybody's guess how long it will take for a builder to reach your catapult and begin actually operating it for the rest of the battle.\n\nOn top of all this there appears to be an outright bug where your character is vulnerable to your own catapult's fire even on the way up, and standing next to the catapult when it fires can cause your character to fumble their crown, flinging it forward into the mob of demons on the other side of the fully-intact wall, instantly costing you the game. This has happened to me more than once.\n\nThese catapult issues are not at all isolated, but if I try and list every stupid thing the friendly AI does then this review will become a very boring novel. The friendly AI is simply totally incompetent. Furthermore, the several entirely new mechanics added to the game have no explanation associated with them at all, despite the game having a simple, straightforward, and enjoyable tutorial for the central mechanic, taken from the original game. The new mechanics are simply unexplained, and some of them are apparently vital. There are cryptic features I am still utterly stumped by, like the shield on the menu, the banner in your camp, or the statue in the forest. These aspects of the game do not feel so much poorly designed as simply unfinished, as if it was shipped in a rush before there was time to put instructions on how to play into the game.\n\nIn summation, at this time this new version of Kingdom remains, as it was before, a beautiful, creative, unique, incredibly mind-numbingly frustrating game in which you want to bang your head against the screen displaying all the pretty pretty pictures because your little men have no common sense. It is definitely fixable with some work, if the developer chooses to fix it. Here's hoping they do.","October 22, 2015","false","21.3"," 426 of 574 people (74%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","74","426","574","23","16"

It's worth 10 dollars to kill some time and see how long you can stave off your inevitable doom. However, the game is in desperate need of a patch to fix some of its glaring problems; and believe me, it has a load of gameplay shortcomings which become painfully obvious after an hour or two.\n\n- The AI is abysmal. I mean painfully and blitheringly horrible. I found myself dying not because of the enemies, but because my workers would charge mindlessly into oncoming hordes of ogres to do something stupid that I didn't want them to do. I lost my best run around day 35-ish because all 6 of my workers charged into a golem as they attempted to repair a crappy tier-1 wall. Another time I died because a troll snuck around a wall somehow and the AI was too stupid to turn around to shoot it, so it walked almost completely unopposed into my base and wrecked everything.\n\n- Further, you have no control over anything your units do, or even over the type of units they become. All of your archers dead? Sucks to be you, the game thinks you want farmers. Don't want your workers charging into an enemy horde to load a catapault or fix a wall? Meh, oh well. Don't want your farmers wondering into the wilderness to farm and then getting picked off like sleeping hens when the enemy shows up? Nope, can't stop that.\n\n- The above two issues wouldn't even be issues if there was a way to grow your population on your own, but you can't do that. To get villagers you have to find camps and pay the campers to come live in your village. The problem with this system is that villagers are an extremely finite rescource and, as I said above, they kill themselves like lemmings and there is nothing you can do to stop this.\n\nIt's a fun game, it really is, but it feels like a mobile game in that it is hampered by bizzare shortcomings which cripple the gameplay once your past day 20-ish. If a fan would make a mod, or the dev would make a patch, this game could be amazing. As it is though, you may find it to be worth the 10 dollar price tag, but I can't really recommend the game in its current state.","October 21, 2015","false","15.0"," 594 of 835 people (71%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","71","594","835","41","39"

Infact, one of my favourite moments is when you finally get past that day 20 blood moon for the first time. It is great value for money and my hours in game isnt a fair representation of the time i have on this game because i play it on other accounts too.\n\nIt has a very small tutorial and then lets you explore the world however you want, so much freedom and choice! The game will punish you for even the smallest mistakes and you will quickly learn, i reset countless times on the first day of playing.\n\nPros:\n\nAmazing sound\n\nBeautiful visual design, I love how well 2D looks in this game\n\nDays and Nights are just long enough to get what you set out to do done :)\n\nEach day has a new challenge, literally...\n\nYour asthmatic horse adds a real challenge\n\nThe steam achievements are really something to aim for and you will find it hard getting them all\n\nCons:\n\nVery laggy at end game gameplay (due to so many archers probably)\n\n(Some people may question this) - There is a lot of freedom ingame as the tutorial doesn't hold you back but some people argue that only being able to place towers in specific points is lack of freedom? Well i agree to a certain extent (thats why it is a con) but that is a challenge in the game! The first 2 towers are always near your castle and the others have to be planned ahead of time, you cant decide to build a wall 200 yards out the night before a blood moon! You have to THINK AHEAD.\n\nThe AI is poor. You can literally run rings around those massive ogre things and they can't hit you and just wait until daylight. Your archers venture so freaking far out at day that they don't even make it back in time at night... I'm not sure why but that needs a fix. It is frustrating.\n\nLack of late game challenges. I am at the point, well i was long ago, where i could win the game in the click of a button but i want to see how far my castle gets me. I could easily send my knights out to the portals and win but i want to see what the game has instore very late. At night 30+ you have probably learned how to manage your money and will be constantly overflowed in cash. This is a problem as i really can't lose past day 30, it is too easy for late game. (Maybe the monsters could be stronger and have more hp late game? instead of just trying too flood my walls and my catapult can 1-shot them all?) that is just a suggestion.\n\nThe game will crash a lot! Especially when you have lots of archers, so save every day because it has happened, when you crash and load back 8 nights ago!\n\nWhy did i buy the game?\n\nWe have all been there, watching your favourite youtuber play a brand new series and get destroyed on the first episode. Then we all think, "Ha! I could do better than that!" Well I couldn't. This game is very hard early game and as i have said, you get punished very easily. -_-\n\nHowever, that wasn't the only reason, i absolutely love games where you can build massive armies and feel "powerfull". I certainly do now! If you like construction games or strategy or something like this in any way, give Kingdom a chance. It is very cheap and offers so much as each reset is randomly generated (sort of).\n\nHow to win (no spoilers)\n\nAs i have mentioned there is no tutorial but that doesn't mean go and search "how to beat kingdom" on google or youtube. The fun in this game is the fact that YOU make the mistakes and you have too complete it on your own!\n\nIf i would recommend any strategy it would be, you can never have enough archers, don't upgrade the bridges (you will find them on your own) until you have walls passed them, find the stone wall upgrade fast (not telling you where it is ;p).\n\nOh ye, and don't expand too fast, i really mean it. If you expand the monsters will tear through your level 1 walls and rampage through your town. Plan your expansions, the night after blood moons is a great time to expand!\n\nRepetition\n\nThis game is one of those that is more addicting than Candy Crush, more fun than COD or CS:GO and will keep you playing until long after midnight. It is the constant "oh i will just play one more (ingame) night because if i go to sleep now i will forget what my plan was" what you don't realise is that you say that to yourself, every, freaking, time.\n\nyou will also get times when you restart of your own decision, not the fact that monsters just took your crown, this can be many reasons but the one that first got me was when; you buy the merchant on night 2 and he gives you four builders, then you find him again very soon, and he gives you four more builders. I just restarted after that.\n\nThere will also be times when you recover from disaster, one well placed boulder from the ogres lands right ontop of you mass gathering of stupid archers but somehow he doesn't break through your last wall and dies, then you panick and spend all your money repairing.\n\nThere will be times when you recover from disaster then make the biggest mistake and have to restart anyway.\n\nIn conclusion i absolutely love this game. It is well worth the price tag, and as i said at the start i have at least 50+ hours on other accounts. I would recommend this game to anyone! Even if you have a laptop worth £10 (well a bit more) you can run this game no problem.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n(This is one of my first reviews ever so give me a thumbs up if you like it) :D\n\n","December 27, 2015","true","11.6"," 66 of 73 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","66","73","7","2"

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!" sort of way. I played the game til just past day 40 and then just got fed up when my whole army was stolen by flying venus flytraps for the 4th time, this was my 4th run through, I always had more money than I could spend (which should never be possible in this sort of game, every coin tips the balance my ♥♥♥), I had about 70 archers at my peek but that didn't stop them all from being picked up and killed and missing all the time or even better firing arrows into walls, I had fun with the game but don't pay £6.99 for it until they fix it. Great potential but isn't there yet, really never thought I would be giving this game a bad review but I can't give it a good one because it got to a point were it was greatly disappointing and I can honestly say I regret buying it.\n\ncomplaints:\n\n1. farmers are miserable idiots.\n2. catapults get 1 shot per night and thats it.\n3. everything and everyone is too slow, except the enemies obviously they are ridiculously fast.\n4. the random map generation makes some games impossible.\n\nhere are my complaints explained:\n\n1. I learnt the hard way that farmers at night go to the base initially UNTIL you build a mill and they will then stand there and all die destroying your cash flow completely since they cost so much, easily avoidable but a stupid thing to have in the game in the first place, completely ruined my first 20+ day game.\n\n2. Builders don't stay with catapults, I don't understand why they don't just equip themselves to them in the same way archers attach themselves to watchtowers, I really think the game would be possible if this was a feature but as it stands it just gets impossible round day 40+ because every bloodmoon there are loads of flying enemy units that just eat all your guys, and they dont just eat 1, they eat multiple units and the only way to get them back is to kill them, i got lucky once and a catapult managed to kill 4 at once and i got my men back, but this is so rare and they are so brutal because those are men you have spent the whole game collecting you can never make up your numbers again and you will lose its just a matter of time.\n\n3. All the units are too slow, just far too slow, your horse is ok when it has stamina but that stamina quickly runs out, but the other units are just painful, AI units should be able to at least run away from enemies from behind one wall about to break to another because atm you have loads of walls, loads of towers but after the edge ones go down it doesn't matter because the only way your going to win that fight is when the enemies have all they can carry. Then you have to hope you have enough coins to re-recruit your army before they all leave.\n\n4. Everything about the random map generation is a pain in the neck because you can end up having only 1 shrine, camps that are ridiculously far away, rivers that are far to far away from your main camp, long stretches without walls, long stretches without towers, its like the programming is just a bit off, it would make sense to me that towers should have walls within a certain amount of units but at the moment it seems completely random. and theres some games it would just be worth giving up at the start because you won't be able to win and you will find out too late.","October 25, 2015","false","9.7"," 202 of 288 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","202","288","5","10"

Once your kingdom stretches across the map, it takes very long to get anything done. Your units need an entire in-game day to get to near the edge of the map from your base in the middle - which might not be a problem in itself, if their AI weren't so dumb.\n\nYour builders, for instance, have no survival instinct whatsoever and will march blindly into death's maw so long as there's a construction job queued up on the other side of it, so once you have a big kingdom, you'll assuredly lose those builders if you don't queue up the job at just the right time of day. Once they're gone, a new set of builders will notice there's an unclaimed build job available and head in to get mowed down, until you have no more builders left.\n\nIn a similar vein, if you upgrade a farm to a farmhouse, your farmers will congregate there at night regardless of whether it's actually safe to do so or not, instead of seeking shelter at your main base, and will consequently get slaughtered there every night if you don't have defenses built. The game does not feature the ability to cancel build jobs or demolish or deactivate buildings, and the issues are further compounded since manpower is a scarce, slowly-renewable resource in the game.\n\nThe poor AI is not the only issue that can lead to frustration in the late-game. As you expand your kingdom, the wilderness camps that function as your source of manpower in the game disappear, leaving you less able to recover from setbacks and potentially leading to a slow, yet inevitable and tedious loss by attrition. As the distances within your kingdom increase, you can end up spending a lot of time running back and forth around the map without a lot of progress to show for it. You can't send parties of more than 8 units to attack enemy portals - it seems peculiar that the strength of the enemy defenses scales up over time, but the amount of troops you can use when launching an attack is fixed at such a low amount.\n\nUltimately, Kingdom possesses an interesting initial premise and a charming aesthetic, and could become a good game if more content is added and its more egregious issues get fixed, but I find it hard to recommend it in its current state.","October 25, 2015","false","9.2"," 113 of 162 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","113","162","4","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lefiath/recommended/368230/","lefiath","lefiath | CZ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lefiath/","583 products in account","This game is simple, but addicting. I wasn't sure it will last me for more than few hours, and I usually don't approach games thinking that I'll stay up all night playing, but I got lucky here. This game is all about management and choices. It'll start innocent, but quickly becomes pure evil the more you hold on.\nGameplay\nYou control most of the things indirectly. You'll start small, and you'll make a lot of mistakes while trying to get bigger. I can't promise you that you'll get hooked the same way I did, but after having few tries on my own, I've started seeing the game differently. It is based around trying it over and over, and I didn't get sick of it. Despite what I've heard, every part, even the beginning, becomes an endurance run. Since you have to control everything, you can't stop.\n\nI've played it at least 15 times and every time I've just tried better. This game isn't mainly about discovering new things, but about mastering the logic it's based on. Sure, sometimes I damn the developers to hell, but I think the fundamental gameplay is good for what it is.\n\nControversy\nThere are some people that are divided about some choices, or more precisely, the lack of them. They have usually played the game for few hours and then stopped, complaining about basics, like AI, or inability to control some things. While they raise some good points, I don't think they apply here. Because the game is so simple, it is essentially based around what they don't like. And that's fine. I think what they're asking for is a more complex game overall, because this is like asking for having advanced control over Lemmings. Also, I would love more complex version of Kingdom, so I'm hoping for sequel or expansion already.\n\nPerhaps it could include an easy mode with some additional choices, because the way I look at it, this game is supposed to be beaten by trying over and over. I can't tell if it'll last 30 hours, but there are many people that have been mesmerized by games like Binding of Isaac, which is also based around playing it over and over. I've found out the hard way, that you can overcome the odds, if you just get prepared. The more you play, the more you plan ahead - that is the way I more forward here.\n\nDon't get me wrong. The game is difficult. But it's difficulty doesn't come from poor design decisions or blatantly unbalanced gameplay. People that drop the towel early might not be into this, but if you just hold on, and give it few more tries, where you learn how to be more efficient, you'll be rewarded with progress. When something limits you, it's made so you can work with it - just like in chess, the more planning you do, the easier your progress will be. And yes, sometimes the random generators can screw you over.\n\nAnd to be honest, there are problems with the late game, where you're mainly forced to run from one corner of the map to another. Apparently, the longer you wait with destroying the portals (your main objective, after you're comfortable with your defences), the more difficult it becomes to take them down, as you're limited with numbers of your attack party, but enemy defence spawn is infinite and increases over time. This is still being discovered by many invididuals on forums, but so far it seems like you can't take your time, which adds another layer of difficulty. You have to be efficient, and really fast. Once you get past day 30, portals become almost impossible to take down - it's doable, but frustrating and time consuming, not to mention that nothing significant happens at that point and you can play for hours, just running back and forth, without any tactics you had to employ at the beginning of game. I don't recommend trying to complete the game this way.\n\nPresentation\nIt's pretty damn good. That is something we all agree with. Music is captivating and what more, along with the graphics it creates a great atmosphere, which I rarely see, especially in such simple game. Overall, great presentation helps you push forward as well.\n\nVerdict\nThis is not a mobile game. It is a PC game, and games like this are rare. The simplicity mixed with indirect influence over your growing settlement is challenging and addicting. I don't mind losing, and I don't mind trying again, until I either succeed or eventually, leave with bruises and broken bones. Either way, I see myself spending way more than 10 hours that I've spend already and every hour was filled with intense planning and resource management.","October 22, 2015","true","95.7"," 60 of 77 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","60","77","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/steric400/recommended/368230/","steric400","Ryan Dorkoski","http://steamcommunity.com/id/steric400/","767 products in account","This game has some of the most emotionally-engaging, postcard-esque ambient environments that I have ever witnessed. The music is literally a perfect match with the absolutely gorgeous pixel art work. When I load it up, it transports me to the fairytale. Few games do that. The attention is in the details, too. The way things move, and shifts from night to day. I cannot stop looking at it. It has a very zen way about it.\n\nThe experience alone is worth the ten bucks. Especially with headphones.\n\n---\n\nNow, lets get into the review about the game, and to some of the debatably negative points.\n\nAt the outset, this game screams mobile to me, because of the minimal controls. Minimal controls typically limit the amount of complexity you can have (and yeah, there are outliers, but in general thats the case). I argued ad nauseam with the devs about the mobile issue, which can be found on the forums.\n\nThe minimalism isn't just in the controls, though. It is also with the interface. The game literally tells you nothing onscreen as far as your clan status (no number of recruits, or a breakdown of any kind - it doesn't even give you a gold count per se).\n\nThere is a fine line in roguelite games in regards to hand-holding. If you offer too much, there is little reward for self-discovery that so many of us roguelite/like fans crave. If you offer too little, confusion takes over and we all begin to really question how smart the game is. "Are there deeper mechanics here, or is it oversimplified?" (ie. Do archers in towers actually have better accuracy? I have no idea. This goes on and on.\n\nThe bottom line here: I wish you had more control over the game. It would violate the idea of minimalism, but would be a tradeoff for higher complexity, and thus strategy.\n\nAnother major gripe is the AI. This is true. I have no idea how to fix this, other than better coding. To me, this translates to having much more fun in the early game, than in the mid- to late-game, where it becomes so much more important to not have hoardes of your troops doing stupid things.\n\nThis brings me to my final point: the game might benefit from time speeding up the longer you play, or something. Its a slow grind. Kind of like when you die after surviving a million days in Don't Starve, its really hard to start fresh and be excited about it.\n\nSome overall suggestions that I have heard, that I think are real possibilities:\n1. You should be able to hunt, to help kill time, and increase interactivity.\n2. There should be meta-game unlocks. Could be everything from cosmetic clothing to better gear and buildings.\n3. It might be worth considering just having the horse be able to run forever.\n4. Implement a 'peaceful' or 'easy' game mode.\n\nOverall, this game has balance issues - but wow they really did pull off a beautiful project that hopefully could slide into something truly great. I doubt the developers will change things significantly (what we have now is probably what we will have forever, more-or-less), but oh boy is the potential there.\n\nI totally recommend it for the experience alone.","October 23, 2015","true","6.0"," 72 of 101 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","72","101","5","3"

It's frustrating when you die when you think you're doing well and a monster horde destroyed you. BUT IT'S STILL FUN.

I love indie games, pixel art, procedurally generated stuff, and empire-building. This game has all four, but unfortunately, it is disappointing for a lot of other reasons.\n\nBefore I get to the bad stuff, let me tell you what's good about this game:\n\nFirst and foremost, the graphics are beautiful. My god, are they ever! The attention to detail is simply incredible here. Pixel art can sometimes be lackluster, but this game was obviously a labor of love for its developers. From the fireflies flickering in the forest, to the gently trickling creeks and gorgeous gradients of the sunrises and sunsets, this game really pulls out the stops when it comes to visual design. It has weather effects, fog, and things you wouldn't normally see in a pixel art game. The animations of the characters are also quite impressive. Overall, the visual presentation is just wonderful.\n\nThen there's the controls, which are incredibly simple and easy to learn. Literally, you just use the arrow keys to control your king (or queen). You can play the game one handed, if you like! You can also use shift to run, but double tapping left and right does the same thing. That's it.\n\nThe game also has nice music. While I'm not sure if it's good enough to be sold as a standalone soundtrack, it is very well composed, quite calming, and fits the theme of the game perfectly.\n\nNow for the bad. Sorry, but there's gonna be a lot of it!\n\nThe gameplay, while solid in the early stages of each playthrough, becomes tedious and frustrating as your empire expands. Your soverign takes a while to ride around the map, and this is made worse by the fact that you ride an asthmatic horse who can't seem to run more than fifty meters without running out of breath. Yes, it is possible to eat grass in order to gain a stamina boost, but if the procedurally generated terrain doesn't have many patches of grass (and this is common), you are out of luck, you will have no choice but to plod along at the extremely slow walking pace about half the time. In the late stages of the game, this can become extremely problematic; it can take a full in-game day of riding to get from one end of the map to the other.\n\nOn that note, I should clarify that everything in the game is time sensitive; it becomes impossible to win after a certain amount of time has passed. You won't immediately know this, and you may futilely try to continue to build your empire, but you will only be wasting your time. The goal of the game is to destroy all of the enemy spawn portals, but the game only allows you to send eight soldiers out at a time to do this, so if the enemies have become too strong and numerous at that point you literally have no chance. The only reason to continue at that point is to acquire achievements, which may be fun for some, but for me, the slow realization that I was doomed and had to start the entire game over again was not a lot of fun (keeping in mind that there is no way to save multiple save files in order to rewind your progress).\n\nThe empire-building is kind of disappointing, too. You don't have any control over where you can place your walls, farms, arrow towers, etc.; this is all pre-determined for you. So, if the randomization is bad, your game will be bad, period. Your only role as soverign is to determine how well you can manage your resources within those limits, and oftentimes those limits will cause you to fail before you've even started. Shrines, for example, provide boosts to your minions and can be crucial for completing the game, but they may be very far away from your starting camp. If that happens, you are probably screwed. The same applies to recruitment camps; they are the only way to acquire new minions, and if you don't have enough camps readily available, you won't be able to replace your soldiers as quickly as you need to.\n\nThe worst part of the game, however, is the minion AI. They plod along at a ridiculously slow pace and will act strangely, particularly at times when you need them to come through for you. Archers, for example, will abandon their posts in the morning and walk miles upon miles to hunt rabbits. If your empire is large, I can guarantee you that they will not return to their posts in time for nightfall when the enemies come. This can be really, REALLY frustrating, and is another reason why finishing the game is often impossible. Another example is the workers and farmers, who aren't intelligent enough to know when the perimeter wall of your kingdom has been breached, and therefore refuse to retreat from their farmhouses. Since you lack the ability to give them orders, you have no choice but to watch them be helplessly slaughtered when the enemies come for them. Replacing them can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming.\n\nAlso, efficiently winning the game requires some counter-intuitive thinking on the player's part. There are certain gameplay elements that should be ignored entirely. Arrow towers? They are useless, and consume your archers! Catapults? They provide boulders to the enemies who can use them against you! Both consume lots of gold that can be better spent otherwise. I found that the best strategy was to simply amass archers and leave them on the ground behind the walls. The community tends to agree on this. Since that is the case, it begs the question: Why would the developers include these gameplay features at all if they actively work against the player's chances to win?\n\nThe game also has very little replay value. After playing for a few hours, you've pretty much seen everything the game has to offer. The only differences between playthroughs come from the randomly generated terrain, and it's all just different configurations of the same stuff. This game could benefit from different scenarios such as snow, jungle, caves, etc., but right now all you have is the same riverside grassland and forest. Don't get me wrong, it looks great, but it does start to look a bit samey after a while.\n\nThe game is also buggy. It likes to crash, especially when you ALT-TAB, but also sometimes just for no reason at all. I also experienced continuous frame hitching despite the fact that my PC exceeded the recommended system requirements by a large margin. It didn't seem to matter if the game was fullscreen or windowed, the same hitching was always present.\n\nIf you're interested in this game but you're unsure of whether to spend your money, go play the free version on Newgrounds[www.newgrounds.com]. Its graphics aren't as pretty and some of the gameplay mechanics are different, but it's basically the exact same game overall. If like what you see and want to take the plunge, I would still recommend that you get this game on sale. In my opinion, the price tag for what you get is a little high.\n\nEDIT: This game seems to have minions that know how to run, now. That's good! Unfortunately the game is still kinda boring. I might reinstall it again and replay it sometime soon, but then again I might not.","November 20, 2015","false","19.9"," 77 of 110 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","77","110","6","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefeint/recommended/368230/","thefeint","thefeint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefeint/","112 products in account","The game is punishing but fair early on, especially due to the almost completely nonexistent tutorials describing what actions will accomplish what goals. I still see no reason to expand - expanding makes it harder to keep track of everything, since your horse runs out of breath every few seconds, expanding requires exponentially more gold, as you have to build walls and towers every time you expand, in case you run low on money and can't expand again before the next blood moon, and expanding also doesn't seem to unlock anything.\n\nWell, maybe it does! Who knows, without any kind of a tutorial  or indication of what it would net you? All things considered, the game benefits from the sparse introduction in most ways, but there's a difference between being brief but informative, and brief and unhelpful. This game is the latter, so far.\n\nI should mention that it was only worth putting a review of this game up BECAUSE I DID LIKE IT - the idea is compelling, and pretty well done.\n\nMy main complaints are with:\n- not knowing what actions to take (i.e. when you build your town center into a castle, what do the upgrades on the left and right sides do? Some sort of shield-looking thing? Defense? Attack?). Without knowing what actions to take, there's no way to decide between playstyles, or even if there are different playstyles that are viable. Looking up the answers would work, but cut out about 50% of the enjoyability of the game, which comes from the feeling of exploration.\nSome small indicators, even little icons, would help with this problem. As of right now, I can't even tell if the 'farmer' job does anything at all, for example.\n\n- incredibly short days, plus an anemic horse and workers. Running the horse until it's out of breath takes something like 10 seconds. It requires something like 15 seconds to recover. Doing that sequence once leaves you with most of the day gone already. In a game which *seems* to emphasize a little bit of exploration, it'd be nice if that exploration wasn't further punished (it already takes a fair amount of money to activate the interesting monuments). And the scouting/hunting archers often walk so slow that a couple don't even make it back behind the walls at night... even though they start at dawn! Even worse is when one of them is almost behind the wall, then stops to take a horribly inaccurate shot at an enemy that then proceeds to mow him down.\nA 'fast' travel system, at least within built-up areas of the player's town, would help a lot. Maybe just make it a simple 'road' building task that costs a couple of coins, and which allows the horse to travel at super-speed within 'settled' areas. Better would be just a straight-up increase in the horse's speed across the board, since you can hardly get 2 screen-lengths over without it turning to night.\nAlternatively, making the day-night cycle several times longer might help, though that would probably just make things more tedious.\n\nAnyways... once again, this is a good, fun game with a couple of non-negligible issues that are un-fun. I don't think it's far off from being a game that I'd find highly enjoyable, with some additional content (which I suspect is planned) and some balance updates.","November 27, 2015","false","5.5"," 118 of 183 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","118","183","4","0"

It's similar to "Craft The World", but you do not have nowhere nearly as much as freedom - which is what ultimately holds the game down for me.\n\nPros:\n+ Excellent soundtrack\n+ Beautiful visual design: It's one of the best 2D graphics I've seen in a game, starting from the sky design to the reflection of the landscape on the river on the bottom of the screen. It's something to behold.\n+ Fantastic, yet challenging first few hours of gameplay\n\nCons:\n- No freedom: Walls and Towers used to defend your town may only be built in specific areas, so you cannot build them wherever you want\n- Maps are procedurally generated; it sometimes places the foundations for walls and towers in really terrible positions. The most efficient way to defend your city is to place a Tower behind a Wall so that while the enemies try to break your wall, your archers can take down the enemies. But sometimes, there might not be any tower foundation behind a wall foundation, which makes you really question such bizarre design decisions.\n- Absolutely worthless AI: The AI is designed to get behind your walls as soon as night falls. However, sometimes your archers simply wander off into the forest and gets eliminated by the enemy units. It's really frustrating.\n- Lack of Depth: Once you have figured out how to manage your gold and workers, the game stops progressing. You realize that there is nothing left to discover.\n- Empty Spaces in your Kingdom: Once you start expanding your Kingdom, you realize that much of it is filled by empty spaces. Buildings can only be built on specific areas as mentioned above, and sometimes you will have this vast open area without any foundation at all, leaving it completely empty. It is a chore to ride through those empty areas.\n- Tedious and Time-Consuming: You cannot build forward outposts. If a citizen loses their tool after being attacked by an enemy (e.g. Bow, Hammer), they have to walk ALL THE WAY back to town, which is like a thousand miles away, and get their tools from there. Your character must be present wherever you want to spend gold; which means if you notice that you have to go somewhere to recruit settlers, but some settlers in your town needs weapons, you have to do either one. You can't prepare items for settlers while exploring.\n\nThese are just a few bizarre design decisions I personally couldn't wrap my head around. I could probably name 10 more (e.g. Ogre enemies causing your clumped up archers which you have no control over to lose all their weapons at once, and if there are two ogre enemies, you can lose over 10 archers at once).

I was really impressed by the concept.\n\nUnfortunately, however, this game is similar to most new games today in that it can be described as "cool concept, poor execution"\n\nI feel that the difficulty ramps up too fast for a newbie to digest. I got screwed over after the second blood moon (night X) because, even though I survived, most of my people died and for some reason at the same time the 5 gold you normally get in the morning turned into 1 coin per morning. Even with that money though when I tried to repopulate hunters they kept filling up the abandoned archer posts and not hunting so I couldn't even get any gold to start over again, so basically I knew I was just going to lose due to attrition/inadequate growth; not even taking into account how the difficulty ramps up in the game. I don't like situations like these in games because even though i'm alive I know it's impossible to win...\n\nTL;DR for paragraph above: You can't afford to get screwed over or you can't win the game. If you get screwed over, then you have to restart the game because there's no other way to win except for a perfect round.\n\nStill though, the whole problem with difficulty is so minute; so trivial. There are so many solutions I can think of to solve it.\n\nE.g:\n-better control over AI, so I can force them to hunt animals instead of standing at a post, allowing me to recover from disaster nights\n-able to disable or dismantle buildings and walls, so that catapults and archers stop lining up behind level1 wooden walls\n-able to stop construction of stuff, so that builders don't get slaughtered\n\nQuick tip: You can actually herd deer toward your archers by chasing them (double tap a direction to sprint). Normally they will run away from the camp but if you keep chasing them eventually the deer may turn around. Chase them back to your archers and if they kill it you can get 2-4 gold from it.","October 23, 2015","false","10.9"," 53 of 76 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","53","76","0","4"

A progressive night time defense game. Although the graphics and sound track are perfect for the game, it needs a lot of balancing.\n\nThe blood moons are WAY to hard for the early game and even late game without the right amount of progression. Being in a watch tower stops the ground enemies from being attacked and provides decent defence. I wish that being placed in a watch tower made them actually land at least 75%+ of their hits to make it actually worth while. Even with higher upgraded towers, they miss about 50% of the time.\n\nThe slow movement speed of all of the workers makes recovery extremely difficult especially when you are a bit farther in the game where you are getting 7-8 enemies each night and having to micromanage your builders while you're out trying to recover your men (if you even have the gold to do so).\n\nIt would be better for recovery if the watch towers could attack animals as well and the deer didn't run away as much and had a tendency to wander closer/inside of the camp rather than having to run and chase after them and redirect them back towards the camp (the only way i can find to recover from blood moons).\n\nLike i said though, idea of the game is really great, it just needs much much balancing. I would recommend the game if, the blood moons start to get progressively harder rather than right from the start being very difficult, or if the rate of recovery was much quicker. Maybe some sort of out of game upgrade system to spend points on from playing the game? Until then the game is extremely frustrating and needs lots of balancing. Not enjoyable.","October 21, 2015","false","7.6"," 75 of 114 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","75","114","0","2"

Do you know that feel? You’ve really fallen for him or her even though you know that he or she is abusive and random like hell and will make your life miserable in a matter of minutes?\n\nThat’s how I feel about Kingdom.\nSeriously one of my favorite games and one of the best I’ve played to this date.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535976618\nStoryThere’s not much known about the story besides that you’re a queen or a king struggling to build your kingdom and to help it flourish by spending every coin wisely.\n\nGameplay (Spoiler free)Why spoiler free you might ask?\nWell the thing is that Kingdom is a very simple and minimalistic game. No one, besides a few that might have beaten the game so far, know what the win condition is. Sadly I’m not one of those. Scratch that. I’m actually happy about it! Does that seem weird?\n\nIf I had to describe Kingdom in one sentence it’d be: Easy to learn but hard to master.\nLet’s start with the basics.\nYou start the game with nothing besides your crown, I mean you’re a king or queen after all, and your amazing horse.\nThere’s a small tutorial awaiting which will tell you, after you’ve picked up all of the coins, how and what to build with your coin.\nBut that’s all the help you’ll get. There’s not one ounce of any information inside the game that’ll help you. Nothing. Not even a single hint.\n\nAnd that Ladies and Gentlemen is the beauty of Kingdom.\nIt’s up to you to find out all of the secrets this game holds. It’s up to you and your trusty horse to explore your surroundings, recruit people for your kingdom and to expand and defend your realm!\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=536106418\nWhile exploring you’ll encounter two kinds of statues which will aid you in your quest to defend your Kingdom and another structure which will help you build it.\n\nIf you’re lucky enough you might even encounter a merchant or find a chest hidden in the depths of the forest.\n\nIn order to progress you have to upgrade your camp and help it prosper into a castle at some point.\nThere’s even a reliable source of income. In the morning of a new day, you’ll hear it trust me, you’ll find a chest inside your camp with some coins in it.\nBut that’s not the only way to get rich!\nIf you’re paying close attention you’ll see your archers, literally, murdering all those cute lil’ rabbits. That’s okay though because … COIN! That’s a hint for you that you can get coin from animals and rabbits are not the ones in the game.\nBesides hunting there’s also another option to get some money.\nIf you upgrade your camp you’ll come to a point where you find a new merchant inside your camp.\nIf you buy the tool which he’s selling you will be able to farm.\nYou’ll just need a place with some water to get one.\n\nThis is as much help as I’m giving you about the gameplay. The charm of Kingdom is embracing every death and to learn from it.\nDon’t be afraid to set out and explore and die. At the end of the day you’ll only be a wiser King or Queen and you’ll be able to build a bigger Kingdom in your next run.\n\nSo to sum it up.\nYou’ll have to earn and spend coin in order to recruit new people and expand your kingdom while defending it from enemies.\n\nNightThe game features a day and night cycle.\nLet’s talk about the night cycle briefly since the day one should be self explanatory.\nWhen the night comes it’s time to stand your ground together with your people and to defend them and your Kingdom. That’s your duty as the King or Queen because  the night is dark and full of terrors.\n\nLet’s make this short. When you’ll see that the moon’s about to rise it’s best to get back to your camp asap since the night is the time for the monsters to attack you.\n\nThere are different kind of enemies … Let’s just say that you’ll have to find the right strategy for every type of enemy.\n\nIf you pay close attention you’ll see a blood moon rising … if you’ve played Terraria you know that dangerous times are upon you and your people!\nAnd if you haven’t played it well … be prepared. Truly prepared.\n\nMaster of CoinNot one of the Lannisters or Littlefinger you silly goose! It’s you! You are, well you have to become the Master of Coin!\nBy that I mean that you’ll have to figure out the best or rather your preferred way of earning money and how to spend it.\nDo you need more archers? What about builders? Should you rather build a new watch tower or upgrade the wall?\nOr should you set out into the wild to find out what those statues are there for?\nSpending money is the easy part. Earning it and spending it wisely is the hard part.\n\nVisualsIf you’ve read any of my reviews before you know that I love pixel art. So much.\nBut Kingdom … Kingdom is a true piece of art. It’s incredibly beautiful and gorgeous looking. There’s so much detail in the game. What I especially love about the game is the reflection of you and your surroundings in the water. Not only that. The atmosphere in the game is just beyond amazing. The game doesn’t look dull since there’s always something new to see. One day it’s raining and the other it’s a beautiful day with a clear sky and another day there’s a mysterious mist.\nJust beautiful. The enemies look good and detailed and so does your Kingdom.\nOverall I’m amazed by how good the game’s looking.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=536106622\nAudioSo good. Oh just so so good.\nThe music in the game is random just like everything else. That means that you might not hear all of the tracks for several hours.\nAfter seven hours game time i’ve heard one track for the first time and loved it immediately.\nThe sound effects are amazing as well.\nYour horse sounds awesome and the whole atmosphere.\n\nThe art style and the music combined make one beautiful looking and sounding game and turn it into a true master piece.\n\nWhat else can I say?I have been lucky enough to get a Review Key for Kingdom in order to write a blunt and honest to God Review. Just as usual.\n\nIt’s amazing. Just one amazing game. It’s simple and minimalistic beauty.\nThere’s so much detail in the game. Also I feel like this is truly a game that everybody can play and probably will play unless you’re put off by the art style. If you are shame on you! You don’t have to love pixel art but be honest with me right now … It does look ♥♥♥♥ing amazing doesn’t it?\nI can safely recommend this game for everyone who’s looking for a challenge and just needs a game to relax. I know that it does help me to relax.\nTo be completely honest I even believe that Kingdom might turn into a game that I’ll be playing for months if not years without getting bored. Unless I find the best strategy but I hope that the devs will crank up the difficulty by then and add more stuff for me and you, yes you!, and just for all of us to enjoy.\nSeriously folks do yourself a favor and buy it.","October 21, 2015","true","19.5"," 71 of 108 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","71","108","7","5"

It was one of those moments where you're watching a Youtube play-through, and you think that "Hey, that looks fun, and I can totally do it better than this guy!". No, no I couldn't, at least not initially.\n\nGetting to grips\nKingdom is one of those games that forces you to play several iterations before you finally begin to make anything resembling progress. You start with a handful of coin, in a forested wilderness, with a night that is genuinely dark and full of terrors. You have to keep an eye on both the eastern and western fronts. You have to manage your hunters, your farmers, the balance of minions staffed around your Kingdom; and you have to do it all with exactly 4 buttons on your keyboard, no mouse action at all.\n\nThis is an ideal game for those looking for something that they can play easily on a laptop. This is an ideal game for those times you have a couple of minutes before work and you want to play something a little more engaging than Candy Crush. This is a game you do have to be careful when playing, because it's very very easy to fall into the Civilization-esque trap of "Just one more turn", or in Kingdom's case, just one more night, I'll just play one more night. Evidenced by the fact I've just looked at my play time, and I'm genuinely surprised that I've clocked in over 40 hours in this game!\n\nThere have been times when I've straight up restarted because I've made terrible, terrible decisions. There are times I've brought my Kingdom back from the brink of disaster. There has never been a time I’ve thought, this is a genuinely bad game.\n\nAesthetically, it’s pretty, it harks back to a simpler design, but not in an ugly way. The music is varied and appropriate, adds definite flavour. There are even weather effects, which, while having no specific influence on your kingdom, inspire a feeling of time passing.\n\nConclusion\nAt the end of the day. It's cheap. It's easy to learn, hard to master. It's occasionally punishing. It's cross platform for both Mac and PC players. It's genuinely good fun. Get it, enjoy it, become mad at it, yourself, and then crush it with your horde of archers and catapults!","November 27, 2015","true","46.6"," 33 of 44 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","33","44","2","0"

Although I suspect that strategy that 'breaks' the game exists. I have spent nearly 30 hours and haven't figure this strategy yet (some player claimed to have done so). This  means this game does have some depth in it, although replayability might suffer IF you manage to find such strategy.\n\nTo get the most out of this game, I suggest that you follow these three steps\n0) Try not to read guide (they are spoilers of your fun hour!)\n1) Prepare to fail and learn from it\n2) Repeat 2)\n3) Once you have beaten the game, repeat 2) and optimize your gameplay\n\nAbout the negative comments, I find most of them are unjustif. Perhaps the haters want a mobile-like tutorial that hand hold you on every single monster, or spent real $ to buy hint . If you set out an attitude to 'learn' this game, you will enjoy this hidden gem!\n\n\n- About the negatives, let me give a more neutral view on each on them:\n\n1) Horse too slow, get tired too easily\nThis is part of the game. You need to manage which area to sprint and which area to walk. And (spoiler), you XXX the horse, and it will run fast without tired. There is actually some 'game' for the otherwise boring movement, kudos for that!\n\n2) AI too dumb\nNot unexpected for rogue-like type of game. When player lose, they blame something, the AI is the major one. THE AI IS MEANT TO BE SIMPLE. It is so simple, so that you can expect what each of NPC does. This is learnable and\n\n3) Arrow keep missing\nThis is part of the game, randomness is involved. This is basic statistic, you pit 1 archer VS 1 monster, you will see widely varying result (from monter win to archer win). But if you pit 5 archers VS 5 monster, you are almost guarantee the 5 archer wins.\n\n4) Town people too slow\nAgain, this is part of the game, managing your subject and your empire. Deciding what to build at each day, realizing that you can't do everything at once is the fun part.","November 14, 2015","true","28.1"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","30","39","0","0"

It's great to look at and easy to learn, but its also very difficult to actually win and usually leaves you watching helplessly as your kingdom falls down all around you. I still enjoy playing it, but I do so somewhat grudgingly.\nOn the one hand, as many others have noted, the game's first impression is very good. The atmosphere it creates for you as you first jump into its world, from the supurb music to its wonderfully done 2D graphical style, is excellent. It's unique, and very immersive. You really do get the feeling of building a settlement from scratch in a mysterious and dangerous fantasy world, etching your kingdom and its people to victory.\nAs you start playing for a while though, Kingdom's problems become increasingly apparent. And they are not small problems. As a result of some seriously flawed design decisions, you come to realize that the game does almost everything it can to make you fail in incredibly irritating ways. It lets you hire citizens, but not control them, meaning they'll make incredibly stupid decisions like abandoning their posts at the worst possible times or let themselves die helplessly outside your walls. It lets you move around on your horse, but makes the world so big that it takes a huge portion of your day just to get from one spot to another on the map, all while your horse is constantly slowing down because it's too tired. It lets you send out raiding parties, but they too will walk so painfully slow that it will usually take an entire day or more for them to get to their destination. This means that unless you set them loose immediately after a Blood Moon, they will all die in transit, and you will then inevitably lose.\nIn general, this is a game that can only be beaten if you know how to exploit all of its inadvertant weaknesses, and do everything perfectly the same way every time. Its simplicity, charming at first. works against it in the end.","November 30, 2015","false","17.3"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","29","38","0","0"

The game is obtuse and slow on purpose.  It's designed this way so that the fun of the game is in the exploration.  And even though I really dislike games that pad game length with nonsense filler, Kingdom uses the speed of the game as a mechanic.  It took me 21~ hours to beat the game.  If you'd like to see some non-spoilery gameplay, I've attached a Quick Look at the end of the review which was a playthrough at the 5~ hour mark for me.\n\nKingdom is a real-time strategy game (with permadeath) where the playable character cannot attack or direct his troops.  Instead you can only recruit more people and upgrade your fortress.  After recruiting people from remote camps, you have to assign them jobs.\n\nThere are four jobs.  Five if you consider the different states of the archers.  Again, this info is spoilery.\n\nWorkers - The only class that can build or repair structures.  The only weapon they can fire is the trebuchet.\nFarmers -  Can only generate money and will not attack.\nArchers - In Defensive mode, they are able to "Hunt and Gather" which is the only resource (gold coins) you need to collect.\nArchers - In Offensive Mode, can only be toggled by creating knights.  Every Knight that is created will convert three of your defensive archers to offensive archers.  Offensive archers will not Hunt and Gather.\nKnights - The last class to unlock.  They can only be sent to do battle once you have a flag raised on either end of your fortress.  They are primarily used as a wall to protect your offensive archers, but they can attack anything directly in front of them.\n\nThe game has no story, but it's presentation is stellar.  The OST juxtaposed against the chunky yet serene pixel art produces this almost zen-like ensemble.  It is a rare game that can so purposefully 'waste' my time yet pull me in to unravel its mysteries.\n\nAdditionally, for the people with disabilities or for parents reading this, the game can be played one-handed.  So you can hold a child in one arm and use the arrow keys on the keyboard with the other.  This is a killer feature in terms of easy accessibility.\n\nPlease try to limit how much you read into this game if you're interested.  Only look for walkthroughs and other things if you are completely stuck.  Again, learning how to beat the game is the 'fun' of the game.\n\nHighly Recommended\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx25K_bgHfg","October 21, 2015","true","24.4"," 39 of 58 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","39","58","3","1"

That's not too bad though, as the game is designed around multiple paythroughs, and failing and starting again using what you've learned can be fun.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the game suffers from a number of game-breaking bugs, which makes it impossible to recommend, despite my early enjoyment.  Random crashes, switches to desktop, sound not turning on, AI and pathing issues of both friendly and enemy units, and, worst of all for me, the game failing to recognize I had beaten it, after a grueling session.

In early game it is wonderfully fun, but unfortunately that doesn't last throughout.\n\nIn the negatives - the townspeople are incredibly slow, have no ablility to alter their own pathing and only respond to a very limited set of cues. The horse will never gain stamina which works fine in the beginning but late game means it can take over a full day/night cycle to travel the length of your kingdom. There is no ablility to add more than two knight parties per side or to scale their "toughness(?)" beyond the bonuses the alters provide, meaning the enemy will get harder and while you plateau at a max level. Possibly the biggest problem, however, is that there is really only one path to victory; experimentation with building styles and townspeople compositions is pointless, because it is really only winnable through one set of action.\n\nWith some additions to gameplay and further balancing this will be a really great game. As it stands right now it is not worth the price.

This game manages to project calm, beatiful melancholy and contemplative planning while almost simultaneously giving off a sense of rush as you explore, maintain, expand and oversee your titular Kingdom.\n\nReplayability is there to be found: randomized setting for each game requires some variance to your broader strategy and priorities. The gently challenging nature of the game ensures all Kingdoms must come to an end, and even after a long game of struggle and survival it feels like there is still something I could do better on a fresh start. Meanwhile the achievements hint there are still things that can be accomplished in the first ~20 minutes of the game that I did not accomplish during my massive Kingdom that lasted two hours the previous night.\n\nClear design with minimalist controls (left, right to walk - double tap and hold to run; down (tap or hold) = action), beautiful scenery and effects pegged as "modern pixel art" by the dev and the light soundtrack well-suited for the overall feel of the game all add up to a gripping experience.","October 24, 2015","true","21.1"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

And that's stretching it, most people would lose interest after 2 hours and some after 1 hour. So lets say you get 2 hours of enjoyment out of this, is that worth 10 Euro? For me it's not, I compare it to a dinner out with my family at a simple restaurant and I enjoy that more than this. ( And I'm a huge beta nerd playing vidyas all day )\n\nThe late game is abyssmal, huge kingdoms that you can spend an entire day running through and there's nothing in them to see, it's all barren as you cut the forests down so no wildlife either. ( And wasting an entire day of just running through your kingdom is horrible as you have ♥♥♥♥ to do before night comes ). As others have said AI is abyssmal, and you need a ton of recruits but the problem is that recruiting people is a finite resource, and to expand your kingdom you have to destroy these camps where you can recruit people.\n\nIn huge kingdoms you gain so much gold your pouch can't hold it, and if you try to pick up too much gold the king or queen will throw the coins into the river, so picking up too much money makes you destroy money. In bigger kingdoms you try to avoid picking up money so you won't destroy it.\n\nIt's an interesting concept, with beautiful pixel art, but horribly executed. It's a good looking front with nothing in the back.\n\nAs you can see I got 7.3 hours in this game, I lost my enjoyment after perhaps 2 hours into the game, after that I simply tried to finish the game, I kept expanding, I tried stuff to see if there was anything I had missed to do to continue to progress my kingdom. But no, that was actually the end, I had done everything I could do except finishing the game. No matter how large I made my kingdom I could not make any more improvements. And improving your kingdom is basically what made the game fun. After 2 hours, I had done everything in the game. The rest of the time was wasted, I was simply confused as I couldn't believe I had already done everything.\n\nI might play this again, to try to finish it, see what the end holds as the developers have been very secretive about it but I won't have any hopes that it will be good from what I've seen of the late game to be like. The worst would be if you win when you have expanded to the end of the world ( a bridge that you can't walk on ) if it's anything like that I will come back and edit this review.","October 23, 2015","false","12.3"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","31","46","0","0"

You can also explore to find mysterious shrines and statues that, when activated with coins, will bestow bonuses or unlock new construction options.\nDo not be fooled by Kindgom's charming graphics and relaxing soundtrack, this is a very difficult strategy game with roguelike elements that asks you to try and discover its mechanics as you play, trying to learn from your mistakes and defeats: if you're up for the challenge Kingdom is an experience as demanding as it is rewarding.\n\nPROS:\n\n-gorgeous pixel graphics, the various weather effects are varied and very nice, there's also quite alot of details (dirt comes up when your horse runs, said horse pants when out of stamina, fields slowly grow etc)\n\n-great soundtrack, I appreciated how it dinamically changes depending on time of day/ weather\n\n-really nice sound design, the ambience sounds change depending on where you are and what time is it\n\n-the mix of kingdom building, nightly defence and exploration works well\n\n-decent amount of things to build and upgrade paired with mysterious artifacts to activate through coins\n\n-appropriately difficult, expect to restart quite a few times before you get the hang of how things work, and then some more when some new monster or a particularly difficult raid comes up to ruin a defence you thought was good enough: conversely when you manage to survive longer and expand it feels really good\n\n-considering its difficulty and the lack of hand-holding beating the game will not be a quick affair\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n-the difficulty and lack of guidance, paired with the need to restart each time, won't be everyone cup of tea\n\n-some design choices in how things work and how the AI reacts will require you to work through the costraints bestowed upon you to be successful (e.g. recruited NPCs will grab the first tool on their path, no way to cancel construction, clear a turret, switch NPCs jobs or assign archers to a certain wall): this will also feel limiting and rather frustrating to some\n\nCONS:\n\n-the lack of hand-holding and information on how certain things work/ change can feel a bit too much at times, bordering on too cryptic\n\n-NPC's speed feels a bit too slow\n\n-basic archers aim is a bit hit ot miss (heh) they'll sometimes try to shoot through solid walls or have problems hitting moving targets: thankfully hiring lots of them and/ or upgrading their firing speed makes things better\n\n-the aforementioned AI gimmicks can make certain actions and nightly defence harder than they'd be\n\n-once you'll finally manage to beat it the replay value is questionable, since there's no difficulty levels, leaderboards or similar stuff\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=536087923\n\nKingdom has been a good experience for me so far: slowly building, upgrading and expanding while trying to survive raid after raid feels both rewarding and thrilling. You won't have permanent unlocks or similar stuff but each playthrough will give you some knowledge of how things work, how to set up your economy or how to deal with the various monster types. This gives, imho, enough sense of accomplishment to make you want to give it a go again. The truly gorgeous graphics and soundtrack also make Kingdom a very nice thing to look at and listen to.\n\nSo what's the drawbacks? Well, the difficulty can feel brutal at times and seeing your Kingdom razed over and over might frustrate you and make a break ncessary. The tutorial explains the very basics and nothing else, after that understanding how things work can be hard at times since certain nuances in AI behaviour or building unlocks can be hard to spot: this means you'll have to be patient and be ready to try things and spend coins on something without knowing the exact result. Last but not least the design choices mentioned in the Neutral/ Cons section will also require you to jump through hoops, lest you fail at what you wanted to do if you forget how the NPCs behaviour works in certain circumstances.\n\nKingdom is not a game for everyone due to its difficulty,but it's a really good game nonetheless and it truly excels when played by its target audience, that is those looking for a difficult game with little hand-holding that requires you to become really good at it to have a chance of finally beating it. People interested in the game but afraid of its hardcore setup might want to wait a bit to see if anyone writes a few guides to help them: this will probably mar the exploration/ learn-as-you-go aspects but will also help immensely with easing them into Kingdom's gameplay: do note that I think no guide'd make the game a walk in the park though, so be mindful of its roguelike inspiration.","October 21, 2015","true","11.4"," 38 of 59 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","38","59","3","0"

I'm sure you've already read that this game has issues, but beleive me it does.\n\nI'll start by saying I love the game. Simple, fun, great time killer. The pixel-art graphics are incredible, the music is enjoyable and the overall feel of the game impresses to no end.\n\nUltimately, however, too many frustrating elements pull together to ruin an otherwise fantastic experience. Take the AI, for example. Stupid as all hell. You can't control where you place you're citizens, you can't stop them from charging mindlessly into a hoard of enemies, you can't have them do... anything.\nThe game also starts to feel dull quickly. You either get king or  a queen and their either or black or white. And they're purple. I'm not sure if this is an issue just for me, but the fact that the enviroment and its monarch never really change means that you feel like your replaying the same doomed prophecy over and over. Just a little bit of variation is all I ask. Perhaps a different enviroment, like say a desert or something. Perhaps you could 'choose' a different style of building? I'm not sure exactly.\nThe difficulty is also far to much. The  'blood-moon' horde attacks are impossible, unless you rush, to defend against even after tonnes of preperation.\n\nSo, I'll say it again, I love this game.

I can confirm that the negative reviews that complain about the game being buggy or not managable in some way is either because the person expected this game to be an action defense game instead of the strategy defense game that it is, or because the person dosen't understand some sort of aspect of the game or some part of strategy and instead of trying to learn on thier own by understanding what caused the failure(which is part of the fun of the game) or giving up and looking for information in a wiki or video they instead claimed it as a bug, called the game defective and wrote a negative review(there are many of thoes reviews).\n\nThere were a few quality of life issues that could have been addressed in the first version but they would have caused a great unbalance in the game. The developers have since created a great update fixing the quality of life issues and updating the artwork and menu, as well as adding some new content and features, and re-balanced the game.\n\nI didn't pay full price but having beaten it several times, would have and consider it worth it. The only recommendation I would give, as it is one of the things I regeret doing before buying,  is you can get more hours of entertainment if you don't watch any videos of this game or read lots of reviews and check forums and stuff(unless you can't figure something out and just give up and want to know) you will find many things that are spoilers and once you learn them you cannot unlearn them or learn them on your own from understanding why you failed","April 16","true","28.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

Why? In Kingdom you have this regal title and everybody will live or die depending on your decisions. Spend your precious gold wastefully and you will be missing your crown in no time. No crown, no Kingdom. On the other hand, if you spend your gold wisely, knights, treasure, and glory, awaits you at the edge of the forests in the form of dark portals, spewing evil every night. Overcoming this evil won't be easy but it will be hell of satisfying. Kingdom takes everything about strategy games and deconstructs it in perfect form. Keeping the complexity and difficulty of the genre but making it so simple that anyone could play it. This is what makes the game so fun and extremely addictive, as you learn from your mistakes in the last Kingdom and improve with your next. However, sometimes the fates are just aligned against you as Kingdom does also feature random events and areas. One Kingdom may be blessed with farms nestled neatly by its side and another barren and dry. If the games mechanics and excellent pixel art didn't entice you enough, Kingdom also has many layers of secrets to it. What lies beyond the dark portals is still a mystery to me and I feel like I was constantly discovering something new and hidden in the forest. It's this mystery and exploration tied with the Kingdom management that will take away hours of my life gleefully.

The game has a beauty to it that's not necessarily tied to its pixel artstyle, but more due to its animation quality and the little touches such as dirt kicking up as you gallop along. And it's a bit different with elements of tower defense, strategy, and base building games all rolled into one. And the game will keep you interest in its first hour or two. But then the signs of the games lack of content start to rear its head. The game shows its interest in the IOS platform because of its lack of controls and mechanics that it presents: the game's simple gameplay becomes repetitive rather quickly. Despite it being designed to be replayable, after two or three attempts: the game has really shown you pretty much its bag of tricks, and that's a major problem in the design area. Your lack of the control of your units will get you frustrated as they wander off doing what you don't want them to do, and you'll feel disconnected from everything that's going on around you. In the end, it won't be enough, and I have to say skip even at the game's lower price.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/QzbCfJy4pEg\n\nLists:\n+:\nWell put together soundtrack that's definitely worth repeated listens. Good sound design all around.\nGame's aesthetic hits the little touches better then most other games, with dirt coming off the ground while galloping around, or the detail on tents that you look at. Very well done design wise.\nThe game is unique with its elements of tower defense, strategy, and base building. Interesting ideas at the core of the game.\nFor the first hour or two, you'll have some fun. But then....\n-:\nIt won't last. Too little variety despite the procedurally generated levels creates a bit of a problem in a game designed to be repeatedly replayed. You'll see all the game has to show in 2 hours, or at least at its basic level.\nLack of control over units means that you're a passenger rather then a direct manipulator, and you'll feel the frustration of that when attacks that might have been able to prepare for if you had a bit more behind you can't be done. You can't prepare at all in any reasonable way.\nNo ways to see what's really going on in the majority of the field which sucks considering the view angle. Some will say that adds to the challenge, but frankly, it doesn't really add much to it, considering  the limited gameplay in question.\nI think with the combinations of other points on this list: the game attempted to go too realistic in its portrayal. Which is a problem, because what it does is hurt the game's fun factor.\nThe game plays slow, and I'm really unsure of why you'd add the stamina mechanic in the game that slows down gameplay even more.\nIt shows its IOS aspirations with the limited controls and frankly lack of options.","October 21, 2015","false","6.7"," 128 of 226 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","128","226","5","9"

The most minimalistic but still complex game with an incredible good control mechanic, and last but not least the freaking best Pixelart Water I have ever seen.\n\nThe Soundtrack is also very minimalistic but pleasening. This game sucks you in while playing.\n\nI must admit, it has some balancing issues if you like to play very long an dont go after the goals.\n\nBut I like the part that every decission you make counts, and you cant make bad decissions undone.

Lost way to many games trough this, this is for me the biggest weakness.\n\n- You cant reposition your peasents - Once a peasent is a farmer, he stays a farmer until he "dies".\n\n- Your horsey needs to walk very slow after your sprint with it. While this is a good game mechanic at general, i would recommend to disable that while you're inside your Kingdom, since its getting really annoying riding that slow.\n\n3 Simple Problems - When they're fixed I would recommend this game to everyone I know.

Pretty simple in its design and very well done.  Easy to get the hang of after a while.\n\nMy only gripe with this game is the fairly terrible AI of your archers, knights, and builders.  They seem to just throw themselves into harms way.  Especially if a wall is flagged to be built but does not yet exist.  Little things like this can easily be fixed with the AI paying attention to the existing states of objects (for protection).\n\nOther than that, the game is pretty challenging and, while repetitive after a while, a lot of fun to play.","April 18","true","23.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

A small little RTS game were you can only go left right and drop a coin, but with an incredible attention to detail. Every thing has a purpose - the sun rises, rain, grass patches forest clearings. The fun of this game is figuring out how all the systems work together to win. It is the first game I have played that feels like leaving it all and taking a camping trip. From experiance, I could write down a list of tactics that will insure victory, but the fun of this game is feeling like a pioneer - going into a strange new world, learning how nature works and then taking advantage of it. I recomend playing this game without any idea how it works and discovering it for youself.\n\nSome people say certain parts of game are frustating, but I don't think they have really master it. Some of their complaints I see as feature, like balancing your expansion to get resources but not making yourself too big (don't be afraid to make very small kingdoms.) My record is beating the game on day 19. Just know when you are playing, you don't just have to survive, you have to take the offensive. And getting the day 1, 2, 3, ect achievements will teach you features of the game.\n\nI've played this for about 40hrs and have not gotten tired of it. This is totally worth it, buy it!\n\nIt also has a subcontext of capitalism as warfare. You can't attack, only pay money, and when your villagers are hurt, they drop their coin you hired them with, they don't die. To be sucessful, you have to manage your money. The monsters don't want to kill you, only get your gold. If you are hit with no coins, you drop your crown, and you lose if the monsters get it. When you are playing, you feel attached to your villiage, becuase you need them and they need you to rule them.\n\nMy only complaint is it starts running slow if you want to make it till day 100 which requires a huge army. Also when the view is scrolling, the paralax isn't in sync, trying to keep it authentic retro I guess. I wish it scrolled smoothly to make it easier on your eye.\n\n5/5","May 5","true","52.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

They will try to go out of the walls (If there is a job to do, doesn't need to be one you commanded it could be just to recharge the balista) even if there are monsters knocking on the walls and you cannot do anything about it. You cant tell them to stay inside you cant really control their mouvement, they are just gonna go and do whatever they want basically.\nThe archers... they will miss their shot about 50% of the time AND will not attack wildlife ( Wich gives gold, your primary and only ressource as far as I seen) if they are on a turret. It is extremely frustrating to see the monsters and wildlife going around not being killed or simply missed 2-3 shot in a row.\n\nThe balista...It will shoot at the sight of a single red-eyed monster. Soo if there is like 10 or more behind it wont hit them cause the balista was fired for only 1  (The balista does ALOT of damage and could greatly help on red moon if only it shot the whole pack) and then it needs to be reloaded by builders wich could be all over the place and by the time they get there the wall might be destroyed making it impossible for the builders to get through basically meaning you'll loose their tools and their services to you.\nAlso I forgot to mention that the archers seems to have no understanding of proper positioning within the camp, unless you build a tower, they could (and most likely will) gather up all on 1 side leaving the other side with 1 or 2 guy to defend and their is no obvious way to tell them to go somewhere, they just do as they please.\nWhen they loose their tool and wont follow you it means you then have to hire them AGAIN and purchase all their tool AGAIN.\nMaking really frustrating to progress through.\n\nDepending if any fixs are made to those issues (if they are issues, if those are intended then I suspect the whole game is just you learning the management and then getting lucky on where your NPCS decides to go, wich is not to great)\nI migth change my opinion but until then I dont recommend it.","October 21, 2015","false","2.0"," 32 of 54 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","32","54","0","1"

No.  One more wall close to the portal maybe?  Only if we cut down a tree that brings the entire band of baddies out the portal during the day.  Oh, and that marked tree brings a neverending stream of hammer brothers from the most distant parts of the kingdom so they can all march to their doom, since I can't cancel the request.  Meanwhile I have to ride my trusty exhausted steed for 2 moons to get back home to make 4 bows at a time for the 30 jobless minions marching possibly 4 moons to get a tool and another 4 moons to reach their doom again.  Why do I have to walk my horse for 2 moons to make my own bows and hammers?  In one try, the knights stood right on top of a farmer's field, so every time I tried to pay them to attack, I accidentally upgraded the farm, thus leaving farmers there to draw out a constant stream of baddies to destroy my knights who must be pumped out 50 miles away.

It has all the ingredients for a great game, but it has too many issues that are game breaking.\n\nThe good: the art is amazing and the animations are really impressive. The controls are simple and the gameplay is very intuitive and fun.\n\nThe bad: it has game breaking bugs (not crashes, but bugs) and performance issues.\n\nThe worst bug I've seen so far are shields not working properly. You need shields to assign knights that can attack portals. For some reasons the shields get stuck up high and no one picks them up, thus it's too hard to attack the portals directly.\n\nThe performance is really bad when nearing the game's end. When a giant throws a rock and a bunch of arches drop their bows the game gets stuck for several seconds, even a minute can pass where the game is stuck like that.\n\nA gameplay annoyance is that your kingdom gets too big for you. When a red night comes and you are on one side of the map and need to travel to the other it takes forever! That's kind of ok, that means you need to prepare better, but there's no way to tell which side the horde will come (not that I'm aware of), just that the sun looks red before a red moon. And then you gallop from one end to the other and everyone is throwing money at you and it gets laggy and annoying.\n\nThe game is too short as well, but I hope the developer fixes this by adding more content over time (I really hope that's the case, but they are in no obligation to do this).\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed the game, but I can't recommend it until these issues are fixed, specially performances and bugs.","October 28, 2015","false","21.7"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","20","32","0","1"

HOWEVER, as it is right now, maybe you should wait. In the hour I played, I enjoyed it a lot and lasted a lot longer than I thought I would for my first time. It all ended with flying monsters that grabbed my villagers and took them away. Anyways, the reason why I said maybe I wouldn't recommend it right now is because of the following reasons:\n\n-It's buggy. At some point it wouldn't let me get rid of trees. The trees just wouldn't take mah money. So then my farmers were left unprotected and I lost both of them. If you can't clear out land, you can't expand. Now this was an isolated problem, it only happened once and hasn't happened since.\n-The AI is weird. The farmers didn't go inside town at night for protection. Therefore, expensive farmers were dead.\n-The way the camera moves. They need to make that smoother. I don't get motion sick, so it doesn't bother me very much at all. However, it was annoying still.\n\nSomeone mentioned in their negative review that the game was difficult. I didn't find it very difficult at all, and I wouldn't consider myself a "hardcore gamer" or anything. I'd say this game is a "challenge" type of game. Take it for it is. It's an unforgiving game, you make a mistake, you're probably going to end up paying for it down the line. With that said, I still believe this is casual gamer friendly.\n\nEdit: -My second time playing the game, there was this invisible wall, it wouldn't let me explore much on either side, so I got stuck with little to no villagers. I restarted and it happened again. Restarted and it hasn't happened since.

Dont be turned away by bad reviews from people with many gameplay hours(they loved the atmosphere and game too!) The day night cycles and weather effects really make this game. It gives you the survival feeling that you want.  There is something fantastic about waiting in your camp late at night wondering which side of your camp will get attacked or a foggy morning when you cant tell what time it is and you feel even more rushed to get everything done before night.\n\nI will say the weakness of this game is the towers.  when you first play this game you will put upgrading towers as top priority but the truth is towers actually dont help you overall.  The first game I played knowing that I shouldnt waste money on towers, was the first play through that I felt like I was really ahead. If I could change something about this game I would say make towers more useful. My ideas for this would be make them come with archers or make them really good at killing the flying enemies. New players dont know that they are wasting money on something that isnt helping them. I have also read that there should be another way of getting citizens besides camps and I agree with this as well.  Running around gathering citizens contantly isnt everyones favorite type of gameplay.\n\nI think alot of the negative reviews are because people love this game soo much it bothers them tremendously when the difficulty gets too hard for them, especially when you've put hours into building your defenses and economy.\n\nPart of me knows that everyone has an opinion about how to make this game better.

Instead, you are a lone monarch riding(sidescrolling) on horseback across your land populated by animals, people and monsters. So it is up to you to grow, expand and defend. That's all the info I want to give on this subject because half of the fun is learning how to play. I've read reviews complaining about the AI of the NPC's in the game, but I think that is a great design "flaw", because it requires the player to actually think about their choices and plan ahead before deciding what is the most optimal strategy. (I beat the game on my second playthrough so it really isn't that hard.) As for things I would like to see in the future. I wouldn't mind a little more variety to keep me interested all the way until the end because once I had come up with the winning strategy it because a game of repetition. I'm sure that the developers know though and are already cooking something up.\n\nThe GRAPHICS are not cutting edge but thats okay, they are very stylistic and although the characters and environment are essentially blocky, pixilated blobs it's done beautifully. The way everything reflects in the water and the ever changing sky keeps you immersed in the experience. Kingdom is a sidescroller that feels oddly expansive. I hope for seasonal changes and different environments in future patches and expansions.\n\nThe MUSIC is one of the best features of this side scrolling defender and they offer an option to purchase the game with the soundtrack. Which may be a good idea because it has many a stellar compositions that add to the games mystique and environment. I have nothing bad to say about the sound design and music.\n\nFor a more challenging experience I suggest playing it without looking up and walkthroughs. You will find the experience much more rewarding when you eventually do figure things out.\n\nI would give this game a 7.5/10 which may change depending on what they have planned for the future.","October 25, 2015","true","30.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jagermaestro/recommended/368230/","jagermaestro","Jagermaestro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jagermaestro/","350 products in account","TL:DR\n\nThe game is… worth 10 dollars, but ultimately tries to be more, and fails on delivering a satisfying experience at either the 10 dollar price point or above.  There was some satisfying early game, dull mid game and downright tedious end game pre-patch.  Post patch is nearly identical, except the end game has been completely broken.\n\nComplete Review (possible spoilers)\n\nCouple of things to get out of the way.  Just because you put RNG (or RMG as one review called it) or whatever you want to call it in the game, does not mean it adds anything.  If RNG is not adding replay to the game, then why is it there?   What’s random and how does the RNG impact your gameplay:\n- There are 2 shrines which buff your towers/walls or archers.  They can either be close to you, or behind gates.  Generally if they are both behind gates you might as well restart your map.  If one is behind gates you can work to free it before killing gates becomes a lost cause.  This adds no replay and in fact ruins some starts causing the RNG to essentially ruin a gameplay without adding anything quirky or fun.\n- 1 upgrade building, which really doesn’t matter where it spawns.  Just run to it quick and you will never need it again.  Doesn’t matter if it is far or close, as long as you get it out of the way quick.  No replay here either.\n- Wall and tower placement, fields with rabbits, peasant camps and mill spots.  These add some variety to layout, but largely will never impact your gameplay what-so-ever.  They seem to be less random as well, in that your start is pretty set with tower/wall after your initial castle area.  Peasant camps seem to be more accessible on the east, less on the west (adding to an already tedious ride across the kingdom mechanic).\n- Maybe some chests… which offer a minor boost in the form of gold and aren’t worth going out of your way for.  Most I have seen is 1 on either side, sometimes so far past gates you really could care less about them.\n\nNone of these being random adds to the excitement of a future play.  Rogue, Dwarf Fortress and other well done RNGs get narrative out of adding in random elements because they have deep gameplay.  This game is so simple it just feels like getting a 2 when you needed a 4 to hit on a D6.  Arbitrary and characterless.\n\nGameplay is nice at first.  Unlike many reviews, I found not knowing what I was doing to start refreshing, and avoided looking up let’s plays and “how to” guides.  I felt, pre- the first patch, that the gameplay was right on early game.  There were things to do while your kingdom was small (recruit peasants and herd deer towards your archers), and later you could run around upgrading, finding merchants and setting up an economy of farmers.\n\nOnce your kingdom starts to grow, however, some interesting mechanics start to fight against you.  If you fully upgrade the castle your taxes get nerfed (mitigatable by having a healthy economy, but really adds nothing).  Expanding, especially to the east, can remove your source of peasants (again, mitigatable, but really not enjoyable).  Expanding your kingdom large enough and it takes nearly a day to get across the whole thing, which is brutally tedious.\n\nKnights are far too few and attack parties far too weak post day 40 pre-patch.  You can destroy gates, but it requires a strange mechanic of tanking for your attack parties and throwing wave after wave at the gates.  Peasants move so slowly back to your castle to get equipped, that you can really only attack once every 5 days, which added to the tedium.  Post patch you will never have this much time, so you will simply lose if you haven’t killed off 3/4ths of the gates early enough.  Also clearing a side doesn’t mean that side is safe (though it may post patch)\n\nPre-patch, the game felt manageable in the long term, but boring and tedious.  Post patch you just get frustratingly eaten away with no re-course, as every night spawns way to many, what I will call wraiths and trolls, killing off your peasants and chewing up buildings faster than your peasants can actually walk to construct them.\n\nThe patch dropped mid-game for me, and totally destroyed my longest run.  I had one half of the map cleared, but can now do nothing to stop the waves of wraiths and trolls that come every night.  Pre-patch I felt I could probably win if I stuck to the boring tedious mechanic of attacking once every 5 days, now I am just waiting to lose.  The game hints that you need to win quicker with its achievements for wins within 25-40 days.  But now the surviving to day 100 seems impossible (where before the others did).  Prior to writing this no one has those achievements according to the global stats.  Now with the increase in cost to attack, I think both are going to be nearly impossible.\n\nThe patch is an extremely confusing answer to the criticism they have got so far.  Ultimately, the game is a nice little diversion, but not a satisfying experience in full.","October 25, 2015","false","31.8"," 32 of 56 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","32","56","0","8"

This is because the seige ogres and waves of enemies will overcome any defense. The catapult is supposed to help with large groups by doing splash damage but it has two problems 1. It is horribly inaccurate and almost never is able to hit things that are right up against your wall and 2. it has to be re-armed by builders, but they don't come running to it from wherever they are loitering at until the first shot is already fired. Oftentime, the catapult will fire one shot at the very first enemy and miss, and by the time the builder gets over to it to re-load it that wall is already decimated.\n\nYou also run into a problem where expansion means that you are not able to replace your population. If you expand into a nomad camp they dissapear. The nomad camps are the only way of getting more peasants. You HAVE to expand to get close enough to the portal, But while you are expanding to get your knights close enough you will encounter a blood moon or two and your population will be wiped out. I've tried leaving 3 camps on the side that Ive destroyed to portals but it takes a day and a half just to walk there and back to recruit 6 peasants.\n\nAfter several playthroughs, my past experiences were too frustrated and boring to play this game again.\n\nAlso I had a crash once when running by a bunch of my farmers, I think there was too much gold flying out all over the place at once.\n\nOne playthrough I got to day 90 and wasn't able to march my knights the great distance to the 3rd portal before night would fall and spawn all the monsters that would kill my knights and kingsguard before they could get to the portal. Tried to build pas the nomad camps that I was saving and I was able to build up right next to portal...but the blood moons were at the point where they were spawning way too many fliers who would eat all my archers and too many ogre guys to deal with.\n\nAnother playthtough I had the two left portals destroyed before day 30 but just got too frustrating at running all the way across the map several times just to get population enough to defend my right side.\n\nI think to beat the game you MUST get a map with the archer shrine. I had the builder one which makes your walls stronger on my 90 day playthrough and no shrine at all on the other one.","November 9, 2015","false","13.2"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","22","37","0","0"

Enemys have basicly 3 types flyer walker(with masks) and heavy.\n\n-U can build only defences, farms and towers. U can upgrade them but thats it. Then in forest u have upgrade totem, 2 buffs and camps which provide u with aditional troops(be carefull dont expand to quickly/ some camps u can leave in ur domain if u leave one tree on left and rigth u will still get the units).\n\n-Game will become frustrating when u reach certain turn/day. I was on lvl Lx and i had like 0 problems of survival cause demonic army just vanished on daybreak. They didnt eaven get halphway in one side when there is a red moon. Problem starts when u are replenishing forces. U cant destroy tower or tell ur soldiers to not ocupy them, so u end up refiling ur troops in 10 turns on front line, and have like 10 useless fully manned towers. That would be ok but it takes 1 day till the peasant get to the castle where he grabs tool...\n\n-Game gets that fealing of rouglike. But i played this game for achievements and the camps were at the same positions so idk but it seems to me that it is the same map. I found some buffs and gates in other locations, but the first 4-5 walls around camp were the same mby i just got lucky idk.\n\n-THE DEER oh dear lord its simple... u need to get in front u change direction, and then lure them into ur archer. problem is when it gets bugged and the deer just doesnt lose agro eaven when u run with full stamina to the other screen. the deer just dont stop. but mby its randomized by a chance so its another small thing, that is frustrating or not that transparent.\n\n-Ai of the workers - just so bad\n\nOverall for me it was not a chalenging experience. It took me 3 tries to figure out the best strategy. The achievs hlp also like a guide when u farm 8 archers on turn 1 u will be ok first 5 turns. When u get many deer u will have 0 problems with gold. The game gets long and frustrating the higher days/turns and doesnt offer much of a chalenge when u have farms on both sides and good defences u just keep replenishing troops and thats it.(It takes a long long time).\n\nIts good game but w8 for steam sale not worth full price.\n\n\n","November 4, 2015","false","11.7"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","23","39","0","0"

An example of this *SPOILERS is when a blood moon rises and you know its going to be bad but instead of being able to tell your farmers and builders to go to the town center for saftey they will just meiander outside the saftey of your walls and be killed, well stolen from then unhired which is an odd mechanic. Your archers have no sense of direction, they will bunch into a group on one side leaving the other side nearly un defended. Basicly, this game could be made to be SOOO much better if you just tweak the AI a bit, and give the player some more control over their kingdom. Have a panic horn so your defensless, run into town or all of your archers run to defend the side that is being attacked. But as it stands right now, and despite the multitude of issues I have written here, for 10$ this is an enjoyable experience and I would highly reccomend it, I just hope they come out with a patch sometime soon to fix these tiny little issues that really bug me.

A lack of control for the player is fine but only if the game works in predictable ways, your men dont, makes the game annoying as hell. No idea if there will be a patch to fix it but if it remains as it is, I would have opted for a refund/not bought the game.\n\nThe game revolves around spending coins to muster a defence against trolls, your coins hire people, buy thier tools, build defences such as walls and catapults. The problem with the game is painfully simple, the things that protect you cost money and end up costing you far more than they should: I was on day 10 and my archers were hunting during the day to produce more coins, when it came to the troll assault in the evening they didnt even attempt to retreat behind a wall i had built, 10 archers cost 30 coins, during the day they made me nothing as it was a rainy day and there was nothing for them to catch, so they cost me 30 coins, you need the archers to defend your kingdom but they're so stupid that it's always a loosing battle, i get thats kind of the theme of the game but this is a ridiculous way to go about it. It's not an exclusive problem for archers, farmers and builders make the same damn mistake and it end up throwing the game into a hopeless and pointless mess. Can't recommend as this 'bug' makes it frustrating to progress and it's through the players lack of control and the AI's poor decision making, one of those things needs to change for me to reccomend it. At the moment the game is pointless but with so much promise. I hope things change with later patches but at the moment it's most certainly not reccomended.\n\n","October 30, 2015","false","9.1"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

The concept is simple, you hire builders, archers and farmers to build walls, farms and watch-towers. After watching multiple playthroughs of this game by different people I finally snuffed out how to do well, not a bad thing. However, my experience playing Kingdom was somewhat ruined by the awful archer AI. Surprisingly I'm not actually talking about the aim that the archers have, oh no, I'm actually talking about a game-breaking glitch that leaves me with no other option but to restart the entire game.\n\nFor some reason the archers who aren't in watch-towers (including the guard's archers) would suddenly stop moving and not fire any arrows whatsoever. I'd eventually get over-run by the attacking force but I found it too cruel that this glitch ruined an entire Kingdom and a couple of hours work. I haven't had many playthroughs but this glitch has sometimes happened near the start (after the destruction of the first gate or so).\n\nEverything else about the game is pretty good though. It has replayability as it's challenging and every playthrough is different with the upgrades being randomly placed each time. You also have to use your head whilst playing and plan out which gates to destroy, as there are only so many camps you can reach to hire people. I love a lot of things about the game but I feel there just isn't enough as of yet.\n\nI'm really excited to see what goes on after this first small period of the game's release. Personally, I'd love to have more upgrades and maybe even adding multiple main hubs as it is a bit of a pain running from one side of the map all the way to the other just to hire people only for them to get their coin stolen.\n\nIt's a bit unfortunate that I've had to click onto the thumbs down button as it's a game I've imagined for a long time and it's finally coming to fruition.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ratking15/recommended/368230/","Ratking15","Ratking15","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ratking15/","62 products in account","So......this game has a very good concept and design along with execution until a point.....and that point seems to be with when you hit mid game or aim for beating it as then you look at what's been done and have to try to find the precise triggers to avoid killing yourself as gold early on is precious but once you get a good supply constantly going on you then need to worry about men, buildings, travel times, armenment and finally battle.....why? Well.....\n\nFor starters when you start the game you usually end up with two camps on each side of the kingdom before you hit the first portal and then another two after that but......those camps usually start until you remove the tree closested to them on both of their sides or so. But you  may need to remove it to get access to a stream or building place and you go then meh you got three more to get men from but that can quickly turn to one as you find that you need to get closer to the portals to avoid your attack parties taking a day to get to the portal, more on that later. But you then end up with less and less camps close by to restock your forces if you take a really big hit and that wouldn't be a problem if there was maybe a way to get them inside your walls like maybe...I duunno......have a family back at your home base? Or build a Tavern somewhere or make some sort of unit that can headhunt more people or attract people to your kingdom. There is many ways but none of these were put in and just means that once you build up fully to the last portals and you killed the camps you kill yourself, it hurts to destroy a camp as you are pretty much disabling yourself.\n\nNow that brings me to the buildings where they are okay to a point......as it seems like the game is set in mediveal times some what which where they had walls and towers but....they also had it eventually be that they could have wallls that they stood on and shot down at the enemy while getting some protection and towers gave protection too as they went completely stone made with turrets and being enclosed. Now this is completely forgotten about it seems with the game as you can get those better buildings as they aren't possible to make and so makes your men much less effective and protected since the flying monsters can't then just take guys out of towers like they were picking apples and your men could then hit the enemies hiding right up against the wall which often require the tower men to take them out somewhat. This also could be improved with the siege weapons which you can only build one of for each side and can't make a permement upgrade to the walls or building to have one just be there. It would also be nice to imrpove the already existing shops you get so that the people that pick up their items can take more hits, move faster, do their job better or have a blacksmith being able to be built which can give those bonuses however that isn't the most needed thing with buildings.....as their a bigger dog in that kennel which is having it be possible to make a bow stand or hammer stand be made where you want or need it to be made as it can take forever for people to get from their camp to your stands and then head all the way back they came to the wall and so being able to make that shorter by moving or making stands closer would just be a blessing and takes me to the traveling times....\n\nAh travelling something that you do every day  usually as you got to your bed to the kitchen to get your breakfast......it usually takes time right? And you know about how long it can take right? Well you have to sorta learn how long it will take for you to travel to one side of the map to the other to recuit men and have it so that they can get inside your walls before darkness comes and usually it ends up being that for the far off camps you need to get going for them right at dawn and sometimes they will make it before night time arrives depending on how big you've expanded your kingdom...but that's ridiculous travel time.....as they are always shuffling along....so slowly when they could be exicited to work for you and run back before semi running to their post so that then they make the entire trip to your base before a day is done. Because why not a run mode for them when something urgent needs to be done that you can just blow a horn or something and they go double the speed for some time with whatever they are doing because you get a run button for you going around the place and it takes forever still to get from one side of the map to the other so for those guys just shuffling away it's really painful and hurts you....like why not have a horse carraige or something come along and pick them up or something like a unit which just goes out and gets those new recuits safe within the walls and once they are he takes them to where they need to go or be....as you can't do that only follow them back while wondering what they are thinking with seeing you behind them on a horse which can race to safety. But your horse even isn't enough as well.....if you expand out too far you can spend a day getting from one front to another so it would be nice to have some sort of faster way to move around inside your base like.....maybe putting down tile paths or something which improve move speed and reduce then travel times overall? Because it just seems like your going around always in the dirt or mud in your base while the forest is covered in grass and moss which I guess would be easier to go along than just dirt or mud  but upgrading that terrain of where you've deforrested to increase movement speed would be and excellent addition to the game and improve it so much more and may remove the need of some things for a while or somewhat at least.\n\nOkay now armrment.....which I did touch on a little already but....there's more problems with it....like with knowning how many people are what so you can then plan according as to what you want and how much from the stands as I find that having four builders is the most you need for you small size while archers you just need a lot of and farmers you need a constant level of them to avoid having money troubles so......if your able to set a sorta limit on how many of each unit you want would be nice along with a auto resupply mechanic too.....as then you can tell when your losing troops too suddenly as at night you don't know where they enemy is attacking until they attack and you hear it or find it, both of which have a very short range...and so middle game you can struggle to know when your getting attacked and where...anyway it would be nice to have more siege weapons too as well since you get this building area for them and...you  can only build one weapon for each side and that's it...which also has bad aim too as well as it can't hit enemies at all really that are against the wall licking it. Also...with what I said about the upgrading of your people it would be nice of where you can give them coins so that they can lose those first before their tools and finally their recruitment coin or just those extra coins means that they can take more hits after losing their tools and so can retreat better too. This would also be nice for getting new weapons too for dealing with those flying creatures as the bows don't start firing at them until they are right up and close which then you need a ton of archers to dps them down. I also struggle to see the point of knights in a defensive role too as they don't try to rush out and attack the enemy...they just hold up their shield and hit their sword against it while bouncing hits..like..why do they have the swords if they aren't going to simply try and attack with them?? Like is there no melee attacks in the game for your units at all? Since like they could try to defend themselves if they are going to not run from the enemy.\n\nAnyway I would write more but I've run out of characters so I'll just say this the game is good at the start but annoying after that.","November 7, 2015","true","9.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

You're basically in control of a bunch of lemmings with no sense of self preservation or urge to actually work.\n\n-There's no indication of how many villagers/workers you actually control and how they are allocated. It'd be nice to see something on the UI that tells you how many unassgined workers you have, how many archers, builders etc.\n\n-The balance is way off as far as getting coin is concerned. The game is so randomised that if you get one area that doesn't have enough animals for your archers to kill you can struggle to get enough coin. Sadly, you get nothing for killing attackers, and that I think is a shame. You really ought to get something...even if it's like one coin for every five attackers or something. It would bring some kind of regularity to the game and aid in the balance.\n\n-You King/Queen has no way of defending themselves. It'd be nice if there was some way to defend. Without it, what you are playing is essentially a tower defence game and that's going to put some people off.\n\nAll of the above means that this feels more like a pre-release game than a full game, which is NOT okay. A game like this needs to be play tested for balance, I don't feel like this one has, it's way too randomised. A little more work and a few minor additions and it'd be really cracking.\n\nThe game is a neat concept, one that I actually think works. It's just the basics are a bit weak & shaky at the moment. I really hope that the developer actually puts a bit more work in and keeps working on this rather than seeing this as final product.\n\nI don't recommend it YET, but may do if improvements are made to the game.\n","October 22, 2015","false","6.3"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/368230/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1598 products in account","Kingdom is a somewhat complex strategy game wherein your main goal is to build, well, a kingdom. You begin the game with no knowledge of how to play, and a brief tutorial fills you in on the starting basics; such as how to light your campfire, recruit beggars, and turn those beggars into builders and archers. In fact, Kingdom is really just a newer, harder version of Lemmings with hoards of enemies that will come for you in the night. Every fifth night, a flock of foes will overrun your quaint campsite, tear down your walls, pick up your people and fly off with them, and leave you in ruins. Yes, as the tagline suggests... nothing lasts indeed.\n\nAfter picking your desired horse/gender/clothing color all in one go on the very first screen, and having the brief tutorial, the game thrusts you into its realm with no further knowledge of how to get by. It's trial and error from here on out, but it really doesn't take too much to figure it out. You build walls and archer outposts to keep the monsters out, gather hoards of beggars that you then turn into archers to kill said enemies, and then upgrade your walls and base camp; which, by the way, ends up becoming your castle. The trick here is that it costs gold coins to do all of these things, and at the beginning gold can be hard to come by. During the day, archers will hunt rabbits and deer, if you run out of rabbits you will then need to herd deer closer to your camp; this is much easier said than done, as they run much faster than you and you can only turn them around if you happen to get in front of them, even then they'll run back most of the time.\n\nAs you expand your kingdom, you will be able to recruit two more classes; the farmer, who will provide you with abundances of gold, and knights that will march toward the enemy gates at your command. Once these classes are unlocked, Kingdom basically becomes easy mode so long as you keep a plethora of archers around. There are four enemy gates, two on either side of your camp, that must be destroyed. Once every gate is destroyed, and every monster that has spawned from them is slain, you will have won the game. Beware, for if a monster attacks you directly, you will lose gold; when you run all out of gold, they will knock your crown off, take it, and it's game over.\n\nThe pixel artwork is beautiful, and the landscape has a variety of randomized weather throughout each day and night cycle; rain, heavy fog, bright sun, and sometimes a combination thereof. The atmosphere brought on by these sudden changes truly adds a depth of mystery to Kingdom, and the folk inspired soundtrack is the polish that adds a shine to the game overall. However, the title is not without its flaws and it comes as no surprise to me that the game is made in Unity; though it is 5 and not the personal edition, thankfully. If you have enough beggars/farmers/knights/archers/builders in your community, the framerate starts dipping ever lower. My FPS was 60 (the cap) for the large part of my play time, but once I neared the end and had a huge gathering of commoners in my community, my FPS dipped into the low 40s and hung there consistently; especially when adding any dropped gold or incoming monsters into the mix. This is simply unacceptable for a pixel based game that really doesn't have any complexity to it in terms of mechanics, ambiance, or graphics.\n\nUnfortunately, I just cannot bring myself to recommend Kingdom; even for the small on-sale price of $5.49 CAD I feel rather ripped off. The area that you have to expand within the game is limited and small, and once you get the gist of how to manage your resources and faux-Lemmings, the game is incredibly easy. The trailers made the game seem a great deal larger, there are also a very small number of different enemies, nearly every beggar looks identical, and most of the walls/archer outposts look the same even after you've upgraded your castle. Kingdom is a game that has fell victim to over-hype, it's okay... but not nearly as godly as other gamers make it out to be.\n\nRating: 2.5/5.0 - It's not awful, but it's not great.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","March 24","false","2.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","5"

The art style is beautiful, for something than can run on a baked potato I'm literally breathtaken. The pixel detail in the water creates a level of fluidity I can admire for quite sometime. The shading effects and art style on units overall is quite satisfying too.\n\nHowever I do feel the game lacks some overall depth, it doesn't feel very much like a "kingdom" yet and I wish there was a larger variety of buildings and monsters/units overall. I would like to see cavalry, a blacksmith, a market, houses etc. Things that make a kingdom a kingdom.\n\nPerhaps religion? A church that allows you to train clerics which in turn buff units and spread faith throughout your kingdom etc? maybe allow the building of smaller village halls. Points with fresh horses. Blacksmiths to upgrade weapons/armour blah blah\n\nthe actual game itself is very addictive and actually quite hard but due to a lack of depth I linger on my idea of coming back for more.

Man oh man.\n\nMy eye fell on it while browsing the store and I felt the urge to buy it. I've been gaming since I was young, and always played games that were made way before I was even born, because my computers were always old as balls and ran on potatoes. My point is: I learnt not to judge games on graphics, however pixelly they may be.\n\nAnyhow! On to Kingdom. Wrapped in beautiful pixel art. Seriously, this is one of the most beautiful pixel games I have ever seen. It also has a very peaceful (or creepy, depending on what's happening) soundtrack. It's not the beep boop noises you would expect from a game with those graphics. Still, very atmospheric and nice.\n\nIt's a resource management game, but with only one resource. Gold!\nOnly 3 buttons to play. Very easy to control, but quite hard to manage.\n\nYou start, and barely get any explanation, just the very basics. This pretty much leaves a lot up to trial and error. It is part of the fun though! So, as you ride through the forest with nothing else than your trusted horse, golden crown and waving cape, you soon find 10 gleaming coins, which you pick up as you pass them. With those coins you can upgrade your campfire and recruit the 2 beggars next to it, by tossing them a coin as the noble king that you are. When your fire is upgraded, you can outfit your citizens with a hammer or a bow, which turns them into workers or bowmen. As you keep upgrading, more tools become available.\n\nWhen you start exploring the woods, you will find more beggars to recruit. Some rabbits to hunt for your bowmen to yield money. You can scare some deer off to your hunters, which gives even more precious gold. You will find some shrines which aids your workers or your bowmen, or a chappel that let's you build stronger structures. You can find a new, stronger horse, which grants you considerable more speed. A kind merchant who supplies you with cheaper tools, which however you cannot choose but are randomized. You can chop trees to expand your Kingdom, create farms and let your farmers grow crops to earn you more profits. And you will find eerie buzzing portals, which at night, spawn trolls who will try to destroy everything you have worked so hard for. Eventually, if your Kingdom is flourishing, you will have a chance to strike back...\n\nRecruit loyal people. Equip them wisely. Expand thy borders. Defend with care! And drive the trolls back.\n\nBasically, in a nutshell, you run around a lot, toss coins at people or upgrades you need, and let them do the work for you.\nYou can help by pushing deer to your hunters, or dropping coins, which trolls will steal and run back to dissapear in their portal. But that is once you get to know the game a lot better.\n\nI managed to finish my first game in 19 hours. I will play this beautiful gem of a game. And I will probably pursue the achievements aswell! Thanks for reading and take care.","May 23","true","26.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I love the minimalistic pixelated feel to the game.  The game is strangely addictive and has an air of mystery to it.  So far, I've made it up to day XVI and the game is already starting to lose some of it's excitement.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I can definitely see this game growing into something much bigger with additional content down the road and community feedback.  But as it stands, there's really not much to it.  I get the whole "figure it out on your own" kinda thing, which I love, along with the mild rogue-like elements (randomization and starting fresh).  But there's only so long and so many times you can navigate either to the left or right side of the village and do the same thing, over and over again, before it starts feeling mundane and a chore (isn't this the bare definition of insanity?).  One simple misadventure while exploring can cause you to die, which always involves getting run down by enemies randomly rushing at you from off-screen...there's no other way to die that I've found.  Dying thus causes you to restart the game with a new (random) character from the beginning...only to do everything over again that you have already done multiple times in the past.  To add, I've only seen one enemy type, thus far...variated by different masks and such.\n\nSo, as it stands, do I regret buying the game?  No.  Will I still play it?  Yes...from time to time (moreso when updates arrive).  I'm all about supporting Indie developers.  But I really feel that the game in it's current form isn't worth $9.99.  $4.99, definitely.  Because of this, I can't make a solid purchase recommendation, which is the only reason I gave it a thumbs down.  Very bare-bones in content - but give it time, the potential is there, for sure!\n\nSome suggestions:\n\nTower archers...shoot the frickin' rabbits!  Don't just stand up there twiddling your thumbs when you're bored.\nBuilders...could you walk any faster to that next tree?  I'm turning into a skeleton here...\nMore enemy variety would be nice.  Also add more things to do when waiting for gold to pop up.\nAdd some some sort of collection/stacking element in between games to reward continued play\nGive more actions and choices available to your King/Queen character (such as killing wild rabbits/deer)\nAdd the option to fast-forward day/night cycles...there are times when gold is sparse and I just want to speed up to the next day.","October 21, 2015","false","4.7"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","19","33","0","0"

Either allow the commanding of individual units or make them smarter. Game is needlessly difficult how it is. It's a cool idea but the gameplay is flawed.","January 15","false","2.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

Graphics and Music are beautiful and very fitting. The game has an amazing amount of complexity for a game that uses only three buttons and there are heaps of small things to learn that will make you smile when you pick up on them.\n\nAmazing game, I have had hours of enjoyment from it and still enjoy it.\n\n-- Minor Spoilers --\nI don't like the way the game scales against you when you attack portals, its easier to kill a portal while you have low population and almost imposible to kill a portal if you have high population.\n","October 24, 2015","true","22.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Lets me start off by saying that the game has potential. However for me it seems kind of dumb. You start out on a horse you ride until you find your camp, you get money and pay ♥♥♥♥♥es to work for you. They build up your kingdom and defend it. Thats the game right there. You have no wave bosses, you have no end goal than to just survive. Which can be great but after a while it just gets really boring doing the same thing over and over.\n\nAdditionally you can have fun with this game, but as I said before as it currently is you will have spent what 10 bucks for this game and at the very least become bored with it in a couple hours. Never really getting your money worth.\n\nI might change this review if they add a few things but right now it seems like the game took about a week to make. It has no content.\n\nThere  are a few things in game that could be added that might change my review.\n\n- A menu that lets you see where you have progressed as far as the ages go in what you can build.\n- Would have been nice to be able to see an expanded view of your Kingdom so that you can see whats going on everywhere like maybe a minimap or a normal map.\n- Would be great if you had objectives to complete each day that earned you a small amount of gold.\n- Would be great if new players knew the overall goal of the game. For example like the portals can be destroyed.","November 5, 2015","false","2.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","6"

The day/night cycle is completely ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, not the mechanic of it, but how fast the days are and how slow the nights are.

Also, you have a bag size for gold again, YOU HAVE A ♥♥♥♥ING BAG SIZE FOR YOUR GOLD. Lategame it is so annoying when every time you go past your villagers with a full bag it just empties into the river. Offerings to the gods to make the game better? Not to mention if you have a lot of villagers and they lose their weapons you can buy weapons at the center of your base for them to use. However the weapon rack only has a maximum size of 4 bows. 4 ♥♥♥♥ING BOWS. Do you know how annoying it is when you have a town of 100+ who constantly lose their weapons to stand next to the weapon rack and constanly pour your gold into it waiting for them to pick up their weapon!@!@!

I wish you the best of luck and are really looking towards seeing the game grow.\n\n\nHere are some tips for the devs:\nMake you so your horse dont run out of stamina when your inside your walls.\nAdd more shops/jobs (this is what i want the most becuase we only have four diffrent jobs your peasents can do and if you add like 3 shop it would add 5 hours more gameplay)\nCancel buildings\nMake so your guys know when they should fall back or add a recall button\nMake a counter so you could see how many guys you have (when you have a big kingdom you cant watch both sides at the same time it would be great if you could see how many guys you had becuase sometimes i see that one of my guys loost his tool and i dont know what he was)\nAdd more things in the forest (would be fun with some exploration)\nMore monkey demons please!\n\nAnd for all the pepole that voting down becuase it misses stuff, IT HAS BEEN ONE UPDATE they will add more stuff but they are not a big team chill out and wait to review if you belive this game is ♥♥♥♥ it will get better =D\n/Uran1um","October 28, 2015","true","8.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Though beware horse riding hero, for there are threats and idles that stand within the fog of the wild. Give coin for followers, buildings and defenses. For with nightfall come those that steal and plunder.\n\nRaise coin by clearing trees in the East only for the fields to become barren and ill treated. Construct water mills and watchtowers to protect the village and then find attack comes three nights later and that those spent are those invested.\nDo you explore during the day and then build while exposed later that evening with those others batter the walls.\n\nOverall the game is a pitfalls and judgement, you juggle coin and expensure in the hope of being better prepared for the threat. What the threat is and if it exists isn't given, however the beautiful way that the game starts with that ominous presence from just sound and visual design. And i mean actual design, trees with twisted foliage and those slow but, small movements being in the fore/back ground setting the mood as one of tension and foreboding.\n\n\n\n45mins Friday on Youtube - https://youtu.be/SV1pRoYMq6A\n\nGoogle Doc - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UpVkMdveN-HvK-vGsNw1l4OiEWzsmC1ea1s5KWRsbds/edit?usp=sharing","October 21, 2015","true","10.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I love the art style and gameplay. There are a few things I wish were a bit different though.\n\n1) I wish there was a gamemode where dying didn't mean needing to restart. You would respawn and maybe lose part or all of your gold. This would make it easier for first-time players to understand the gameplay concepts without such harsh punishments.\n\n2) More customability in your kingdom. While the maps are procedurally generated, there are set places for walls, guard towers, etc. The ability to place an object anywhere you want might detract from the simplicity of the controls, but I'd love to see it as an option in the settings.\n\n3) A tutorial would be really nice. I've had to read through the few guides currently on the Community Hub to understand a lot of what's going on (e.g. the function of Knights and how to establish stone walls). This is another feature that could be turned on/off from the settings.\n\nOther than these three items, the game is pretty much perfect. It's a lot of fun with tons of replayability.

I can't help but get a Studio Ghibli feel from this game, specifically Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away (the Greed), type vibes.\nI like the general atmosphere of it alot.\n\nAnd I will start the review off by saying please DO buy this if it's ON SALE, preferably on a rainy night when you have a few beers in the fridge.\n\nThat said, this is why I have to give it a pass. Based on three retries until finally completion THEN another completion second time clearing every tree on the map and what I would consider "dominating" the game, and watching various videos on the game both casual runs and hardcore optimized runs. I have formulated this opinion.\n\nWithout giving too much away because the "mystery" is MOST of the fun in my opinion.\ni.e. figuring out all the game mechanics and how they work exactly, and how you can use them to your advantage and maximize your efficiency.\n\nThe game starts to become way to formulaic with very minimal ways to beat it.\nYou must optimize the way you play, you notice each run (if you are organically figuring the game out) you aren't REALLY doing much more then trying to save time, trying to maximize population, and trying to maximize gold more effeciently each time. It almost reminds me of pro gamers playing starcraft2 with their meticulous"builds"\n\nthe difficulty is superficial in the sense, at first you will screw up by not understanding certain mechanics fully. once you understand them you will be pretty much obligated to play a certain way, and with minimal content (buildings and units) everybody's "winning" game is more or less the same exact thing. even with the "Generated map" which is mainly just for exact shrine locations and various tower and wall spots on the map, they are all more or less the same and unfortunately play the same.\n\n\nVery minimal content. THIS is actually the main offender of why I felt obligated to give this game a pass. review could change if more content is added. This portion is to try highlight what content is IN the game and my SUGGESTION of what I feel it is missing.\n\nGame: One single level with one flavor (with negligible "random gen")\n\nShould be: A multi-optioned game, Single player campaign, Free play, Multiplayer (coop or battle mode would be SO sick)\nDifferent flavors for the map, snowy tundra, desert, maybe some kind of city level etc etc.\n\n\nGame: 3 unit types, 2 of which are special limited units (knight and catapult). So the game ends up just being an archer spam to victory.\n\nShould be: a few more unit types, even if their almost regarded as vanity units and cost a ton of gold, maybe a wizard hat that when equipt the recruit can shoot little fireballs, maybe an upgrade for the archery station to get crossbows as an option (they could be really good against air units or something but worse against normal creep because they can't shoot over walls or something)\n\nGame: For the sake of argument the game has 3 major buildings you build. Wall, Post, Farm.\nShould be: Not to upset about the minimal nature of buildings, although a few more options would be nice, maybe an upgrade for the walls to have a hot oil spiller guy at the top, maybe some type of ultimate guard tower that actually covers your guys so they can't get gobbled by flyers (very costly, possibly only for a NG+ mode or something along those lines)\nSpeaking of NG+, for the love of god give us "Silver Horse-shoe" upgrade when we beat the game. "your horse can run much longer without tiring" would be great.\nThen when you beat it a second time make it so you can have different horse colors or king colors, maybe they have a bit of armor (strictly for looks not gameplay) more vanity options for king and finally the horse could have "Golden Horseshoe": "When the cruise control key is pressed, your horse will just continue running a direction until further unput" (half joking, half serious)\n\nBugs and logical inconsistencies:\n-the game will legit creep to a halt lategame with alot of workers and coin on the screen, even with a great gaming rig, poorly optimized.\n-After I beat the game, It pans over your kingdom after credits roll, you can't skip any of this, then it shows your king again and... nothing... pressed all the keys couldn't restart, couldn't quit, nothing. (game did not freeze) so I literally can to ctrl alt delete, and close the program....\n-Catapults supply large enemies with rocks to hurl BACK at your guys, effectively making them useless if you are not babysitting your workers back to their job, or back in your kingdom, HUGE losses can take place on the other side of the map because you bought the catapult thinking it would be "beneficial" when in reality, it is detrimental and a bad design decision.\n-Sometimes I've had a builder "repairing" a building seemingly indefinitely.\n-terrible AI in general, archers running at enemies, builders standing next to a building they built OUTSIDE of kingdom walls, no hurry to get back within safety, ultimately getting attacked.\n-can't cancel build order, accidently throw a coin on that tree when it's getting close to dark? ok that guy is gone now. frustrating.\n-various other AI behaviors\n-once you unlock a portal. there should be a portal in your base. PERIOD.\n-obnoxiously sitting in your base to re-gear your archers after an attack, because the archer station holds 4 bows, and your trying to regear possibly 2 dozen men.... (another reason why base needs a portal)\n-lategame when there isn't very many camps left, it's literally impossible to come back after a major loss of population. let's say you lose 8-10 people. and there is one camp before the portal. you can only do two people per day. so your going to wait 4-5 days to get your army back to what it WAS before the attack that WIPED you out with that pop? (assuming you do that perfectly) all the while the waves get harder and harder from the initial wave that broke your line to begin with. No. Your not. Logically it just doesn't work. It may as well auto game-over for you to save you time.\n\nGreat carpal tunnel coin-picker-upper walk from one side of the map to the other until your eyes bleed-simulator. Great chore simulator.\n\nIn all honesty I'm only critical of the game because it actually has some immense potential to be an amazing game, an absolute classic, unfortunately it isn't there yet and while I am unfamiliar with the devs I feel like they made it a simple game not because that was their "grand vision" but unfortunately because making it an expansive and rich game would be over their heads (just assuming based on it being a small team and indie studio)\n\nIt seems like something that would be on a flash game website, MIND YOU on the front page for months and months.\n\nA "big fish in a small pond" type of game,\nthat jumped into the ocean.","March 24","false","22.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Unfortunately, right now it is a bit let down by the buggy mechanics which can make you suffer heavy losses, often either unrecoverable or just recoverable enough to last until the next time time it happens. There are a couple of things that need to be altered so that they work a little better. The also diminish a big part of the fun of the game, as you are left at the mercy of uncontrollable NPC's just doing completely random things.\n\n1st. The deers. Right now they are utterly pointless in the game. To make it even remotely worth your while chasing them down, you have to travel pretty far out to get 3 or 4 of them together. Then you have to sprint for WAY too long before you can get ahead of them to turn them around back towards your settlement. This means by the time you have rounded say 3 of them up, you are pretty far away from your camp, this wouldn't be too much of an issue if it wasn't for buggy mechanic number 1. Basically, when herding them back to your camp, the deer will one at a time randomly turn direction every say 6-8 seconds, and run back away from your camp. You CANNOT stop them from doing this, trust me I have tried walking them back, I have tried sprinting them back and keeping the same distance all the time, I have tried a mixture of both, nothing works. So basically no matter what you do, because you are so far away from your camp, by the time you get there you are left with one deer, 2 if you are very lucky. BUT, thats no the end of your woes, the deer have to be shot twice, soon as they are shot once then run off again meaning you have to try round them up again ALL before the sun goes down, at which point your bowmen will no longer even shoot at them and the whole debacle becomes an utter and complete waste of your time. Until they fix this i recommend you do not even both with the deer if you value your sanity.\n\n2nd. Your NPC's everynow and again, just doing whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they feel like doing. For instance, I often see my bowmen just wandering off into the forest, not just a little way, like a long long long way away, so far away in fact that when it becomes night time and the demons come out, they are so far away they can't possibly make it back to camp in time before getting killed. They also take it one step further and randomly walk around the village, sometimes just before nightfall which is where the buggy mechanics result in heavy losses part comes in. I'm not sure if they are trying to do, maybe switch sides from left to right or vice versa, I'm really not sure, but the end result is they are all spread out when night comes, instead of being all together huddled up by a wall so they can kill the demons before they break it down. This leaves the wall relatively unguarded and once the wall is down you cannot prevent them demons from just running riot, stealing all your NPC's bows, hammers etc and coins. Once this happens, you may as well just restart as if you dont, by the time you have scraped enough gold together to get back on your feet again it happens again at which point its game over. I got to level 38 a little while ago and I felt like I was virtually unkillable, I had loads of archers and a fully upgraded wall with catapult next too it so I should have had no issues killing the Demons before they over came the wall but when night fell, none of my archers were in place on the left side and the Demons just took the wall out uninpeded and then it was game over, all completely out of my control which is the worst part.\n\nI hope they hotfix the game as I enjoy playing it.","October 23, 2015","false","31.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

The artwork and graphics are pretty and it's enjoyable to build up your own little settlement from scratch.\n\nHowever, it has to be noted that while all of the above is great the game does not swing well for the player. You have no control of the AI. Sure, you can make them tools and in turn they will pick them up, but other than that you've got no way to control them and tell them where to go. The AI will however balance itself between both sides of your camp so you do not end up with all your resources at one side, which is helpful.\n\nFurthermore, the attacking AI is very overpowered and has little remorse for it's actions! Day 4 and you've got a red moon? Well, I do feel sorry for you because the defences you would have been able to build on this day will be weak and they will break through, steal your items and then probably want your crown too! Your town AI is useless and can't aim where they're shooting so if you have a big invasion your only option is to kite the AI around your archer towers and hope for the best.\n\nThe AI needs work, that is easily said, but I think for filler game like this, the enjoyment is still there.\n\nTL;DR - It's fun and pretty, but don't smash your computer because of the AI!","October 23, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Although the game trusts you to discover these things for yourself, which I like, it ended up being a bit much for me (probably because each game plays out largely the same way), and I ended up searching for tips to accelerate my progress. Some features seems unnecessary, like the inability to build what you want *where* you want. I imagine this would unbalance the game, but that's no excuse to not address the issue; people want more freedom in building their kingdom, even if it means needing to add more difficulty to keep things challenging, i.e. more monster types and/or more varied attack methods from existing ones. I agree with other reviews that suggest the current difficulty would be a lot easier to accept if each game played out differently. If I lose a game of, say, Civilization, I don't really care because I actually LOOK FORWARD to a fresh start, thats one of the best moments of the game. Adding a pinch of that feeling (somehow) would make this game far more enjoyable.","March 23","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Though I don't really like playing pixel graphic games, 'Kingdom' gives me a totally different experience. With not much introduction, this game lets yourself discover your own best way of defending your kingdom and attacking enemies. Many tricks can be discovered after a few plays which may help you a lot, eg, teleport using the destroyed enemy portals, horse gets better stamina after eating grass...  With the beautiful BGM and visual design, this game is quite addictive. I did not really expect such great gaming experience when I first decided to purchase this game (for a half price, I think it is worth a full price though).\n\nHowever, there are a few aspects that are not so satisfactory.\n1. The game is not of great replay value after you have got every achievement. Basically, it is not difficult enough after you have mastered the concept and all the tricks of this game.\n2. The processing power is not enough. After recruiting more than one hundred soldiers, the gameplay is not fluent any more. And when the enemies attacks with rocks, my computer will freeze for more than 10 seconds as about 30 archers need to pick up their bows. (Maybe this is caused by my computer but I think it is the game codes that lead to this problem.)","March 31","true","21.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Armed with merely a torch, your trusty stead, and a few gold coins to your name, you seek out new lands to call home. In Kingdom, a new pixelated 2D sidescroller strategy game from Noio, Licorice, and publisher Raw Fury, you bring civilization to the unruly masses inhabiting the countryside, glory to your name, and defense against the creatures of the night who would delight in seeing it all stripped from you.\n\nWhile this isn’t Noio‘s (or, by his real name, Thomas van den Berg) first game, it was the first time I stumbled across something he made. Having just heard about it the day of its launch on Steam a few days ago, I was pleasantly surprised by the game’s minimalist aesthetic. From the gameplay concepts (build and expand your kingdom while protecting your gold and, ultimately, your crown; if you’re attacked and lose your crown, you also lose your right to rule–after all, those with the fanciest hats wield the most power) to the pixel art and UI, Kingdom is seamless in its execution, blending modern flourishes and technique with old-school visuals and simplicity.","February 9","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sounds obliviony right? You recruit citizens from camps around watersources and buy weapons and buildings with gold generated either from hunting, daily survival rewards or farming. Lovely game and highly recommended but there needs to be few more things. Had to play for several hours before understanding the whole logic. You then find out you have to do the exact same things each time to win.\n\nİssues:\n1. Can't cancel an order. Builder and all others after him will go to their doom by your misclick.\n2. Can't call/order troops anywhere except to attack the gate. You may know the east wing has fallen but your citizens certainly do not.\n3. If attack order is given when the group has not assembled you may have partial attacking groups.\n4. Theres no point in attacking at any other time then a specific time period which you have to understand yourself.\n5. A bug prevents game completion (See the despair at the end of video)\n6. If you happen to build a forward wall just before night, your dumbizens will assemble at the previous wall first then move to the outer wall (and get slaughtered)\n7. Hunters dont generally go too far in to the tree line, but they will go miles to hunt (hence die at night), if there are no trees. Once they went all the way to a gate and in a large group no less.

You can be focused on the right side and since its 2D linear you might have to travel a long time to get back to the left and while that feels slow at times it adds a degree of uncertainty that keeps you moving around.\n\nThis is definitely a streamlined game that doesnt have a ton of features, but this again is a nice change of pace from the clunky tower defences im used too.","October 29, 2015","true","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Seems like the type of game I'd love, if not for the one huge flaw: There's no progress to be made, except beating the game! You're literally back to square one, as if you had just bought the game, whether you die on day 6 or day 37, leaving you to rebuild your kingdom from scratch with minor tweaks in an attempt to make it further. This is obviously a conscious design choice, but it's ruining the game for me.\n\nThe idea must be that the progress is all in my head, that I'll play better and make it further next time. That's not very motivating, especially after dying on a slightly earlier wave than last time. This is why games like this always give you some waypoints to shoot for (as in Binding of Isaac) or at least some amount of progress towards unlockables depending on days survived (as in Don't Starve), so that you'll have an overarching sense of progress even as you keep dying.\n\nI find myself restarting whenever I figure out a game mechanic I wasn't aware of or spot a small mistake on my part, figuring that even if I recover, my run might not be strong enough now to make it to the end. That's a sign that my motivation is only going to keep dropping.","November 20, 2015","false","4.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are a lot of bugs right now, so anyone who wants to play a perfect game is not going to get that at the moment, and should expect something to happen.\n\nJust now I had a game where I sent two armies to destroy portals on both sides, they both succeeded, and waves of enemies came crashing into my walls, On one side, I was able to defend well, the other side, they got into the inner camp, (right side walls all down).\nWhen they were in my camp I was next to my main fire, a Giant enemy knocked my crown off and it went on top of the fire, I couldn't pick it up and they couldn't hit it into the water, and nothing could pick it up.\nSo I defeated those enemies with my archers and I still couldn't pick up the crown, so I had to save and exit and restart the game.\nwhen I restarted I could pick up my crown, I found this a bit cheaty but I carried on anyway, this all happened on day 12.\n\nOn day 16 (after the blood moon) I sent out the next set of armies, since I was able to recover so easily.\nit took longer to get to the portals than the last time I had attacked them, so I destroyed both of them on the same day at day 18, I had placed gold in front of them as well to stop any huge waves from completely wrecking me.\nHowever, I could not defend well enough, and they knocked down every wall in my kingdom, and the flying enemies went somewhere when they could no longer get anymore people, I had no more people to fight anything.\nThere were no small enemies anymore either, they had gone somewhere or had died in the fight, but there were still Giant enemies.\n\nTo my surprise, they never melted, and day never came, I waited until day 25 at this point to hope day might come, I could not save due to this, so I could not exit the game and come back to see if I had won.\n\nAt day 20 the blood moon never came, so I knew there was no more enemies going to spawn, and they never did, there was just 6 Giant enemies trying to knock my crown off.\nSo I just gave up and said I won basically, I had no way of making any gold to recruit anyone due to no day, and I couldn't win in any way.\nDay was basically gone entirely, although the sun always came up and down.\nIt was the first game I was even close to winning, and so I was very disappointed that something like this happened.\n\nThough this happened I would still give the game a 5/5 for where it's at, if this was a finished and entirely ready game I wouldn't recommened it, but I know how much it would mean to the devs if you did buy it at it's current state. :)\n\nI hope you do in fact read this review and gain some insight as to what can happen, and are not steered away by what I've said, because that would ruin your chances at playing a great game.\nI will continue to play, and I hope you all have fun.","October 29, 2015","true","30.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Kingdom is ideal for those who enjoy a bit of resource management with a dash of tower defence. The almost too simple controls and interface do feel a tad underdeveloped, but it works with the overall game. You nudge your little Kingdom along and need to make the right decision at the right time. It took me 15 or so hours to beat this game, and it was extremely satisfying to achieve this.\n\nMany reviews focus on poor AI, insufficient ability to micromanage your people, and general inability to 'tell this to do that', with the sole interface being 'purchase item', 'recruit new peasant' and 'build/upgrade this'. I just want to highlight the fact that, according to the credits, this game was made by two people. Two. The game costs $10, not $100. I feel the AI, control scheme, and amount of interactivity is sufficient for the price. Moreover, it adds to the charm. No, you can't micromanage every single aspect of your kingdom, some of your poor choices will lead to your defeat (and restart). That is part of the challenge of the game. Remember Mario? One life, zero f**ks given. Hugely popular spanning multiple generations.\n\nHarden up and get ready for Kingdom, this game is a winner.","October 29, 2015","true","19.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

My next 5 runs or so I was not as lucky, and I only made it to around day 20. Then there is my current run. I am at around day 80 and have so many archers that my computer slows down every blood moon. Getting to this point in the game is not easy. That is what is fun about the game. You die often at first, but after each death you learn from your mistakes, and you slowly do better each run. The main downside to the game is there is not very much to do in the later days. The first 25 days are very interesting, but as you go on further, it gets repeative.","November 29, 2015","true","23.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Especially when the game brings in the special enemies.\n\nWhat i would also love to see, is completely game changing randomized maps. Now the only randomized bits are the shrines, camps and portals, but what if the whole land layout could randomize. Instead of two direction defence lines, there would be maps where you build your kindom against a mountain wall, so that only thing you have to do is to procceed forwards.","October 25, 2015","true","4.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Travelling from one end of your kingdom to another end to manage it and send people out can take an entire day. Late game content doesn't bring much and is the same as the early-game content, just with more money and more people. Map generation can sometimes be unfair.\nIf the game was shorter or had some better content towards the end of the game, I would want to play it more.\nAs far as play-time to price efficiency, it's not good. 10 dollars for a game I spent ten hours on, some spent more, most spent as much as I did or less, is too much. Could easily be priced at a 5 dollar game or a 2 dollar game.\nWhat needs to be remembered however is that this game is a flash game, nothing more. It looks damn good for a flash game, but like many other flash games, it is severely limited.\n\nTl;Dr Good game but not worth the 10 dollars. Buy it if it's on sale for at least 50%.

Also, the placements for upgrade shrines, recruitement camps and even the bases for your towers are randomly distributed every game.

However, I do not want you to be put off by it being 2D, as I find the way it is played is very good. The graphics are beautiful.

There's also a free demo of sorts in the form of the original prototype ( http://www.noio.nl/2013/10/kingdom/ ).  The full version adds a fair bit of extra content, though I wish there was more.  For me the primary draw was discovery, which also meant that eventually I would find all there is to find (though then again is this not true of a book or film).  That said the layout is randomized a little each time, so while the final push and the opening days tend to go the same every time the second act varies from session to session.

However, there is one major problem (which may be fixed in future updates) and that is, there is really no choice, there are 3 combat units in the game, one of which has a cap of 2 units, another has a cap of 4, so it's really spam archers, make sure you have 4 knights, 2 catapults, and build up for each blood moon or an attack on a portal. Once you have your knights, catapults, defences, whatever, all you really do is prepare spare men for when you finally send off an attack party to suicide, and it gets really boring just preparing to attack over and over. Another issue i have is one enemy in particular, most people call it the 'Ufo' enemy, and it swoops down, grabs your men and flies off, it can do this to any of your men, including knights that cost so much, and on top of this, your archers on the ground cannot target them (they can still target other enemies and if the arrow hits the flying ♥♥♥♥er and kills it you've won the lottery.\n\nTL:DR Great game, get it on sale, gets a bit repetitive, not for people who dislike a challenge\n","March 25","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's simplicity is amazing and I have spent hours playing it (on somone else's account). I have yet to beat the game, as it seems very difficult. I never feel like on of my lost runs was a waste of time, thought. Every time I lose I figure out something new. A new strategy, something I did wrong, something I didn't do right, a way to speed something up, etc. As weird as it sounds, this makes a decent party game if none of the people at the party know how to play the game. My friend, my brother, and I had a several hours long session of this game where we all gave our input and strategized together. I've done this a lot and it's fun every time. It's also the reason that most of my hours are on someone else's account.\n\nNow for the bad. Well, when I say bad, I mean I haven't figured out a way around these problems. The world is randomly generated, and sometimes it is MUCH more in your favour. I'm not sure if it's always winnable. It probably is, as I don't have all the strategies down, but the point is that you are to some extent, at the game's mercy. Another issue is that there really isn't much to the game. You can get all of your buildings fully upgraded to their final form very early on if you're quick and if the game gives you a good layout, and then after that you can only expand, not upgrade. That said, the game is still being updated, so who knows how much they're still going to add.\n\nAnyways, I can definitely recommend this game. It looks great. It sounds great. It's fun. ect.","March 23","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Kingdom tells you almost nothing, You'll die a lot and have to start over quite a bit, but once you figure out exactly how the systems work you will start progressing, and that progress feels amazing.\n\nHere's the problem. Once you have an understanding of how to progress, and once you have reached the upper tier of progression, Kingdom kind of loses the mystery which is what makes it so special. Then the worst thing that could happen will happen: you'll lose. You'll die and have to start over but already know exactly what you need to do and how far you can go.\n\nYou'll be infuriated because you know why you died, you were randomly given a night that was way tougher than any of the previous nights, or your stupid guards and knights will all be on one side of you defenses and not on the other, and when they start to migrate your kingdom is so big that they won't make it in time to stop things from falling apart.\n\nThen you'll be done, because at the point the mystery is gone and the lack of direct control over your Kingdom will stand as a more glaring fault in the game's design rather than a "oh, now why did that happen?" magical, almost emergent, gameplay experience.\n\nBut I happily played this game for 8 hours. I really fell into uncovering the mystery behind the systems and just trying to see how far I could get and how long I could last. I paid $10 for this game and at 8 hours of play time I would easily have spent another $10.

Just a warhorn or some such that would cause the soldiers within a screen's width to gather around you would make it SO much easier to manage your people. Then, even if it's tedious to run six steps and blow the horn from one end of the camp to another, at least it would be possible.\n\nIf there IS a way to do this someone please tell me... save my sanit-- oh, nope.

This game is fun, I dumped an hour into it, and probably will dump a good few more.  But you are...deceptively limited in what you can do.  WIth a game such as this, where you will fail often (and you *will* fail often), an element of randomness, either through RNG, or through how your playstyle effects the world, is appreciated. In this game, your playstyle changes in that you learn not to do one, very specific thing that caused your death, and then do the exact same thing otherwise.  There's an element of RNG in here, but it's extremely limited, and basically means "your village will have a *farm* here instead of a bridge, and a *bridge8 here instead of a farm".  Even the enemies are predetermined, both in number, and in direction.  Restarting the game essentially means running through the same motions with little to no variation, until you reach the point of your previous doom, and then not making that one mistake again.\n\nIt's not that this is a bad kingdom building game, if you want to build a kingdom, this is definitely the game for you, but only if you want to build one, because no matter how many times you restart the game, the end result of your kingdom is going to have very little variation.  Building locations are preplanned, and your only input is delivering coins to build them, or choosing to not build them at all.  Combat is dull and uninteresting.  Your input here consists of running away and letting other people deal with it, unless you failed to get enough soldiers (or their AI fails to recognize that there are monsters), meaning you have to restart and put more work into getting back there, but this time add 3 archers.  I will say that the walking is, oddly enough, fantastic.  You get to walk by and see your citizens doing their work and collect coins from them, and you really get a sense that this is a kingdom.  It is just not your kingdom, it's the kingdom that the devs built and allow you to throw coins at until it does things.","January 29","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here is how I break it down:\n\nSound: Fantastic soundtrack that adds to the immersion, even if it's not too varied.\n\nGraphics: Far as pixel art games go, I can't complain much. The characters themselves could have been better, but the buildings and scenery is spot on.\n\nGameplay: Fun, challenging, and simplistic. Plays just fine on a controller or on the keyboard.\n\nOriginality: There are other games out there that feel like this game on the surface, however the mechanics are what stand out. They are so simple that a 1 min tutorial does the trick, but as you progress you feel like you're in a more complex situation even whilst using the same mechanics. That to me felt very original.\n\nLAST THOUGHTS: I greatly enjoy the game, though a tad bit of customization, back story, and variety would be nice. I do give the game a thumbs up, because up against a $9.99 price point I simply feel like it's worth the money. It will be enough to distract me for a day or so, and when I'm tired of it I'm sure to dust it back off and play months down the road.","October 22, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From archers wandering out of your walls in the dead of night for no apparent reason, directly into the mouth of the marauding enemy. To your own catapults deciding that even though the enemy is out of range, they'll happily fire a boulder into your own troops and take out 30 of them just as the monsters arrive at the wall.\n\nFurther, you may find that you need a single engineer to further advance but they keep wandering out to get killed because some time ago you asked one to build a wall just beyond your current one. You can't undo this...you can't undo anything. So you may string along a continuous stream of engineers that never make it, and find yourself restarting.\n\nWhat this could have used was a lot of inspiration from King Arthur's World back in the SNES days. That you build exactly the troop type you want at that moment, and that you could have a modicum of control over their actions.\n\nAll-in-all, it's interesting enough and very fun if you coax out the quirks of the game and try to work around them.","February 7","true","32.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Except your Kingdom, it'll last forever with enough archers!\n\nThis game needs a lot of work. It is fairly fun in the early game as you scramble to build a decent fort against the demons, but once you have enough archers and your base in stonebased, it becomes trivial. By around day 30 I had enough archers that nothing would even dent my walls, I thought that the ogres would up the challenge, but they did not.\n\nThe game begins to stutter once you have too many units on the map; the archers being the main issue for this problem as everytime they shot at something the game would have an FPS drop. I collected villagers from both sides of the map daily so around day 50 I had about 150 guys running around and by day 60 when I had broken 3 demon portals I was zipping around the map collecting ALL the fresh villagers. At one point I thought the game was going to crash because I had like 175 archers alone.\n\nThere is a lack of variety in monster types and villager types, which I found disappointing, after you've seen a late stage bloodmoon, you've seen em all. On top of that the game pretty much nudges you at making nothing but archers to win the game. You dont need that many farmers and about 5-10 engineers are enough for your base in the end game. The game became very boring and I had to force myself to finish it after I broke the 3rd demon portal.\n\nThe music and graphics are the high points of the game, it is very pretty and relaxing. I loved that everything was reflected in the water. The sky was very pretty as well as the background. I don't have anything bad to say about the aesthetics of the game. Also, I thought the control scheme of the game was interesting, I somewhat enjoyed that.\n\nI bought this game when it was on sale this week so I believe it was somewhat worth the price, but it is not worth full price. The game is too short, too repetitive after a certain amount of time, and too easy to be worth 10 dollars. You could probably slap this game on the Android or Iphone and it would be perfect on that format.\n\n5/10 Game.

My friend, my brother, and I had a several hours long session of this game where we all gave our input and strategized together. I've done this a lot and it's fun every time. It's also the reason that most of my hours are on someone else's account.\n\nNow for the bad. Well, when I say bad, I mean I haven't figured out a way around these problems. The world is randomly generated, and sometimes it is MUCH more in your favour. I'm not sure if it's always winnable. It probably is, as I don't have all the strategies down, but the point is that you are to some extent, at the game's mercy. Another issue is that there really isn't much to the game. You can get all of your buildings fully upgraded to their final form very early on if you're quick and if the game gives you a good layout, and then after that you can only expand, not upgrade. That said, the game is still being updated, so who knows how much they're still going to add.\n\nAnyways, I can definitely recommend this game. It looks great. It sounds great. It's fun. ect.","March 23","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But it gets frustrating (and sometimes not possible to win) unless several of the game mechanics are in your favour (especially placement of portals/structures/farms), which all seem to be based on luck. It's a game that I play knowing I'll never beat it. Many reviews that I've read, however, blame the mechanics that are interesting and fine as they are, so long as you know how to use them (i.e. if it takes you so long to travel from one end of your kingdom to another, rest your horse better or limit expansion of your kingdom; if your workers get killed chopping down trees at night, learn to send them out in the morning; don't get mad blame the game! learn something!) If you don't understand the game, that's entirely your own fault.\n\nA few things that do bother me:\n1. The AI is...... nonexistent? You can't cancel orders, so you quickly learn to time your commands according to when your workers won't get killed. Then, occasionally, one will decide to wander outside of the existing walls, without you ordering them to, in the middle of a siege, just because they figure it's the perfect time to repair a broken outside wall. And then they get hit, lose their hammer, pick it back up, and repeat. And repeat.\n\n2. Everything is based on luck, which both makes a simple game like this fun to play again, but sometimes far too frustrating. But because multiple things rely on chance, there is potential for everything to go to hell, despite your efforts. The first patch really did seem to help with that.\n\n3. The game at first didn't seem balanced, as no matter your efforts the enemies exponentially grew and swarmed to proportions that no amount of preparation or people could stop them, but that has since been fixed. Thank you, devs, for listening!\n\nA few things, however, that I would not change (based on negative reviews that seem to complain about the game not meeting their personal preferences, rather than objective problems with the game):\n\n1. Keep the horse's lack of endurance. It inevitably sets a limit on how much you can accomplish in one day, but it adds interest if you're stuck in the woods at night, and means that you can't always outrun your evenmies.\n\n2. I like that this game doesn't hold your hand. How things are done are made relatively clear, but when to implement these changes and why are left to you to decide, and you'll gain that knowledge from interacting with the community and from your own experience.","October 23, 2015","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

However, there is one major problem (which may be fixed in future updates) and that is, there is really no choice, there are 3 combat units in the game, one of which has a cap of 2 units, another has a cap of 4, so it's really spam archers, make sure you have 4 knights, 2 catapults, and build up for each blood moon or an attack on a portal. Once you have your knights, catapults, defences, whatever, all you really do is prepare spare men for when you finally send off an attack party to suicide, and it gets really boring just preparing to attack over and over. Another issue i have is one enemy in particular, most people call it the 'Ufo' enemy, and it swoops down, grabs your men and flies off, it can do this to any of your men, including knights that cost so much, and on top of this, your archers on the ground cannot target them (they can still target other enemies and if the arrow hits the flying ♥♥♥♥er and kills it you've won the lottery.\n\nTL:DR Great game, get it on sale, gets a bit repetitive, not for people who dislike a challenge\n","March 25","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Kingdom tells you almost nothing, You'll die a lot and have to start over quite a bit, but once you figure out exactly how the systems work you will start progressing, and that progress feels amazing.\n\nHere's the problem. Once you have an understanding of how to progress, and once you have reached the upper tier of progression, Kingdom kind of loses the mystery which is what makes it so special. Then the worst thing that could happen will happen: you'll lose. You'll die and have to start over but already know exactly what you need to do and how far you can go.\n\nYou'll be infuriated because you know why you died, you were randomly given a night that was way tougher than any of the previous nights, or your stupid guards and knights will all be on one side of you defenses and not on the other, and when they start to migrate your kingdom is so big that they won't make it in time to stop things from falling apart.\n\nThen you'll be done, because at the point the mystery is gone and the lack of direct control over your Kingdom will stand as a more glaring fault in the game's design rather than a "oh, now why did that happen?" magical, almost emergent, gameplay experience.\n\nBut I happily played this game for 8 hours. I really fell into uncovering the mystery behind the systems and just trying to see how far I could get and how long I could last. I paid $10 for this game and at 8 hours of play time I would easily have spent another $10. Highly recommended for those wonderful hours of figuring things out then trying again and again.\n","March 23","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's also a free demo of sorts in the form of the original prototype ( http://www.noio.nl/2013/10/kingdom/ ).  The full version adds a fair bit of extra content, though I wish there was more.  For me the primary draw was discovery, which also meant that eventually I would find all there is to find (though then again is this not true of a book or film).  That said the layout is randomized a little each time, so while the final push and the opening days tend to go the same every time the second act varies from session to session.

This game is fun, I dumped an hour into it, and probably will dump a good few more.  But you are...deceptively limited in what you can do.  WIth a game such as this, where you will fail often (and you *will* fail often), an element of randomness, either through RNG, or through how your playstyle effects the world, is appreciated. In this game, your playstyle changes in that you learn not to do one, very specific thing that caused your death, and then do the exact same thing otherwise.  There's an element of RNG in here, but it's extremely limited, and basically means "your village will have a *farm* here instead of a bridge, and a *bridge8 here instead of a farm".  Even the enemies are predetermined, both in number, and in direction.  Restarting the game essentially means running through the same motions with little to no variation, until you reach the point of your previous doom, and then not making that one mistake again.\n\nIt's not that this is a bad kingdom building game, if you want to build a kingdom, this is definitely the game for you, but only if you want to build one, because no matter how many times you restart the game, the end result of your kingdom is going to have very little variation.  Building locations are preplanned, and your only input is delivering coins to build them, or choosing to not build them at all.  Combat is dull and uninteresting.  Your input here consists of running away and letting other people deal with it, unless you failed to get enough soldiers (or their AI fails to recognize that there are monsters), meaning you have to restart and put more work into getting back there, but this time add 3 archers.  I will say that the walking is, oddly enough, fantastic.  You get to walk by and see your citizens doing their work and collect coins from them, and you really get a sense that this is a kingdom.  It is just not your kingdom, it's the kingdom that the devs built and allow you to throw coins at until it does things.","January 29","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just keep in mind that hunting gets more productive as you extend the range of your archers by cutting down trees. Don't rush extending and building, BUT - destroy some trees to the left and give the archers some extra space for hunting. The only downside is that they sometimes return too late to the camp (= don't return at all).

When you build up your own Kingdom, you really feel like the people are your responsibility, and you feel awful when any of them die.  It has pretty good progression, and you really feel like you constantly have to be doing something.  It kinda has that Harvest Moon feel, you know.  You feel like you wasted time if you stand still for even a second, since you kinda did.  There are lots of ways to get gold, but they can't really be accomplished purely by yourself.  You depend completely on your archers, builders, farmers, and everyone else.  But in a roundabout way, they also completely depend on you, since you are essentially the strategist.  I mean, it's not too uncommon to be the strategist, case and point Fire Emblem, but rarely do you still have a playable character who can get stuff done on your own.  It creates a really interesting gameplaym style, and really reinforces the whole feeling guilty when your recruits die.  Like, you recruited them, for a measly gold coin, to defend you and do all of your other dirty work, without much choice on their part.  When they die, they die for you, and purely because you recruited them.  Additionally, the graphics and overall feel are really spot on for this kind of game.\n\nSince I'm not a big fan of /10's, I'll just say whether I recommend it or not, and in what circumstances.  Basically, it's not a game for everyone, it's not a game that will give you 100's of hours, and it's not the game with crazy cutscenes and story.  It's a game you play to be fully immersed in and actually give a damn about.  If that interests you, buy it.  If you  refuse to play a game without that stuff.  then don't play it.  But at the end of the day, there's really no reason not to pick it up.  It's really cheap and something that can really be called an experience.","May 30","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music in this game is amazing, never has music in a game effected about how I feel about my current situation with said game so much. Whether it was when I realized by the sound that a blood moon was near, or when I had heard the sweet sound of those bells signifying I had made it to another day.\n\n2. The 2D side scrolling element keeps you engaged. It keeps you constantly moving or aware of your surroundings. Your kingdom is literally dependent on you, where you go and what you do in a spot will effect your game heavily. With regards to the mighty steed your given, it's just a horse. Horses can't run forever and to expect so is, isn't reasonable in this game. I know it took me by surprise for a second, but it challenged me to think about if I needed to run or not sometimes. My only complaint is that the walking horse movement is way less awesome than the running horses. Seriously, cape flying in the wind, hugged up against your mighty steedy, seems way cooler than trotting along.\n\n3. A lot of people seem to be complaining about the lack of explanation going on during the game itself. I will admit, the game doesn't offer much help besides a miniscule tutorial and a few simple instructions. But, I think that's the point of it. You are a monarch trying build (or rebuild?) a kingdom and there's no guidebook to doing so. This game won't hold your hand, it'll toss you out of the nest. It's up to you whether you fly or not. It took me three playthroughs to have SOME understanding of this complex and beautiful game. But that's what I loved about it, I found out how I can lose and came back bigger and stronger each subsquent play through. So if you don't like being thrown out into a world without much help, this game isn't for you.\n\n4. The AI of this game is at best, simple minded. Archers=shoot, Builders=build, farmers= farm etc. This is a pro and a con. Pro because it's easy to understand and work with, con because there's no way to change it up once you make the decision to purchase your choice of simpelton. What I appreciated about it though is that it forces you to consider what your future goals and manage your time. Do you need those archers to hold your wooden wall? Or should you focus on reinforcing those walls instead of having more men to guard them? As previously mentioned, it took me a few tries to understand how much my early game truly effected my gameplay later on.\n\n4A. By managing time I meant how you chose to use ithe simpelton AI. It challenges you to decide what to build, when to build, and where to build. Having walls is nice, but if night time comes and they aren't done, well you're gonna have a bad time. This isn't just for walls as well, there's recruiting, exploration and much more. But t I don't want to spoil too muchmore I know I already have given away a lot.\n\n5. The enemies at times are overwhelming, but sometimes you won't even notice they attacked. It's seemingly arbitrary, and I love that. It keeps you on your toes when considering what is to come the next night. But sometimes, no amount of archer or steady wall is good enough to fend off your foes. They break threw, they beat your people, they pillage, they destroy and they leave. You can't do much about that sometimes. What you can do though, is wipe of the blood and dirt and get back up. Is it going to be easy? Most likely not, unless you have a healthy amount of gold or are lucky enough to find a chest or a merchant. But nothing worth having is easy to get. Sure, it would be nice to have an easy way out and recover everything with one simple click or whatever, but it would for sure not feel the same. I was frustrated, horrified and downright vengeful when I saw those monsters breakthrough. But it didn't stop me, it only motivated me to keep going. Sure I lost in the end, but next time I'll be more prepared to face those devilish raiders. This game isn't forgving, it would be way worse if it was. It is very rewarding though, to feel the sense of victory after fending off a wave, or recovering ground after a devastating loss, I haven't gotten that from a game in a long time.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, didn't really know how else to put it. If there's only one real thing you want to consider before you buy this game, it's whether or not you're ready for a challenge. A very rewarding challenge at that.\n","October 22, 2015","true","13.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Amazing graphics and a superb soundtrack that ties directly into gameplay.\n2. Minimalistic design which makes it easy to learn with patience and experimentation.\n3. Challenging (to learn and effectively manipulate all mechanics) and unforgiving gameplay.\n4. Some conflicting game designs.\n5. Fast paced and can easily make you frusterated (but don't give up).\n6. Potential for greater depth with a few changes.\n\n\n1. Amazing graphics and a superb soundtrack that ties directly into gameplay.\nThis is the first thing anyone who plays the game will notice. The graphics have so much effort and thought put into them. The layering affect is well done and really adds a certain depth you likely won't get from many other sprite games. The music sets the tone very well and you can always tell when danger is coming your way (spoilers: blood moon music).\n\n2. Minimalistic design which makes it easy to learn with patience and experimentation.\nThere are many smalls design choices which you will likely miss on your first play through. It is important to learn from your mistakes every play through. It is also very important to explore, even waste precious gold (which you will learn isn't too hard to get later on in the game). There is a surprising amount of depth hidden in the minimalistic gameplay. Just as an example, you can herd deer towards hunting bowmen to earn money more easily early on. You can also drop coins to "bribe" Terrors to run away. Eventually, once I learned enough of the game mechanics, I was able to understand most design choices and like them.\n\n3. Challenging (to learn and effectively manipulate all mechanics) and unforgiving gameplay.\nYour first playthrough ever is going to end in failure and there is no way around this. This isn't bad though. Most short games that aren't (REALLY) easy usually push you towards a loss if you're a newbie to the game (or force feed an uneccesarily long tutorial down your throat). However, it becomes challenging when you first start developing your strategy and dying over random mistakes that aren't necessarily tied with how you built your base. As you progress later, how you build your base is VERY important. Making one mistake can cost you a game. My last run before writing this guide, I cut the first tree on the right side while trying to recruit people and lost that camp. Since people are worth more than gold, it was an incredibly huge loss. (I had intentionally destroyed all camps to my left and had expanded all the way to the edge so my best camp on the right disappearing cost me the game).\nMy playthrough beforehand, I managed to destroy both left portals but made the mistake of sending my right side off as well. The forces that came down upon me all at once destroyed me, but I didn't die so I tried to rebuild. Needless to say, it was fruitless. I spend 25 of my 50 days just trying to rebuild. Picking up that one coin I got everyday, baiting monsters into rabbits, buying an archer and earning some gold, and then getting blood mooned and having it all destroyed again. On my last attempt, I waited to buy anything except one archer during the day to earn 3+ gold until the night after the blood moon. Even with the most time I could hope for, I was unable to rebuild enough to return to my former glory and died throwing my body in the way to try and save my kingdom. Needless to say, I know both these losses were my fault and I've learned from my mistakes but they do bring me to my next point.\n\n4. Some conflicting game designs.\nFirst, I'd like to mention that the AI is actually pretty solid overall. Often, it is the player's mistake that causes units to do stupid stuff. The biggest thing I think shows me a conflict in design is map size, horse endurance, and the day/night cycle. The map is huge. There are 8-10 areas on either side of your base that can contain various things. These areas are also broken up by a cluster of trees. Not to mention your base itself is fairly large. This all gives a fairly good idea of how large the map is or at least how much there is to explore, take into account, and expand your kingdom on. However, when combined with a horse that gets tired easily and often (I know there is a mechanic that lets the horse run much longer but it doesn't come into play enough to notice it without being explicitly told IMO) and a day/night cycle that takes five minutes, one of the core/promoted mechanics of expanding becomes an extremely unviable option. Your obese horse (fanart of this please) and the short day/night cycle make it nigh-impossible to cross even a decently sized kingdom, not to mention a base that crosses all the way to the end of one side. If you're trying to recover from a devastating attack, it makes it extremely difficult when your limited wallet means you have to cross your main base to get to farmers to give you gold or reach archers on the edge of your base. This issue gets stacked against your odds even more so when you consider one of the current monsters. The flying tentacle beasts will come en masse to completely eat all of your troops, farmers, and workers. If your soldiers are shooting anything but them, they'll be swooped up and carried off. Three archers on a maxed out guard tower aren't enough to take out two, let alone the tens that spawn later in the game. The only way to replace/gain more units is to go out to camps and pay them to come back to your kingdom. They then walk at an insanely slow speed, making far camps often unviable. When you start expanding, you also destroy these camps permanently, along with all the potential units you could have bought that spawn there. The one thing you're told early on in the game "Build, expand, defend." ends up being something that is used against you.\n\n5. Fast paced and can easily make you frusterated (but don't give up).\nIf you've gotten this far in my review (I would be surprised considering the blocks of text) and still want to give the game a go right now, I think it will be right up your alley. While the game is challenging, you'll find a lot of the unfairness is actually part of the design. When I checked to see if anyone had some walkthroughs on the game to see if I should write one or not, I was surprised to see that there many guides that made that shared the same ideas I had come up with. To me, this feels like the intenional part of the game design is where this game really does shine if you just give it enough time. Remember, since the game is so minimalistic, it has to be hard as hell or else you won't spend enough time on the game to justify spending $10 (IMO). This is where the devs got it right... Really right. If you can accept you'll probably fail the first time and get better and better, then this game is very rewarding. While the difficulty is partially so high because of my previous point, it's also high because the devs really did design it that way. When you ♥♥♥♥ up hard enough, you probably should lose. Though, I personally wish the devs made death quick and painless. If you survive a huge wave and try to rebuild, you'll only be met with further frustration and time wasted not just restarting and playing a new game.\n\n6. Potential for greater depth with a few changes... (AKA I ran out of space on this section).\nI liked the idea of using a up-arrow to make units follow you. Whoever had that idea, kudos. Alternatively, cancelling orders would be nice. Difficulty setting(/map size) would be nice. Custom map generation with user controls could be cool. A nursery/third farm upgrade where units spawn would be really appreciated and negate point 4 almost completely but decrease difficulty.\n\nOverall, 10 hours for 10 dollars is a good buy.","October 28, 2015","true","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Primarily? The AI. As the king you have very little control over what is actually going on, just who and what has money, sadly the AI that does have control seems to have intelligence similiar to that of a goose. Scratch that, a goose would run away from a 10ft tall monster. Builders are completly suicidal, and will rush into anything to get a job done. Wall needs repairing because of a horde of monsters? They're there. Catapult needs reloading behind enemy lines? They will try. You started a construction project and they took to long to get there and now the sun is setting and certain doom is lurking around the corner? These hammer weilding lil ♥♥♥♥♥ don't even hesitate. On to archers. Perhaps a blood moon night wiped out a couple layer of defenses? Well any open spots in turrets will soon be filled even if it is miles away from your nearest wall. They also tend to come back to base the last possible second before nightfall if they are hunting, and I have lost many a soul to a monster blitz before my poor dense villagers got back. Honestly though my favorite are the farmers. If you upgrade a farm to tier two they treat it like a rally point that is safe, even if you havn't put up the walls yet. RIP farmers. Guess they got to water their crops with blood. I'm sure all of this sounds infuriating and not at all worth it, but honestly it is a quite enjoyable game. As of right now most the stupid AI kinks can be worked around by building the right things at the right times and knowing what can go wrong if you screw up. Almost like an unintended difficulty bonus perhaps? I don't know. I do know however that I will be keeping my eye on this in hopes of AI improvements, or perhaps the ability to set nightitme rally points for villagers / mark towers as not to be used / mark build projects to be delayed. Those simple fixes alone will make this game easily 9/10 to me as a fun light game to play.","October 27, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The music in this game is amazing, never has music in a game effected about how I feel about my current situation with said game so much. Whether it was when I realized by the sound that a blood moon was near, or when I had heard the sweet sound of those bells signifying I had made it to another day.\n\n2. The 2D side scrolling element keeps you engaged. It keeps you constantly moving or aware of your surroundings. Your kingdom is literally dependent on you, where you go and what you do in a spot will effect your game heavily. With regards to the mighty steed your given, it's just a horse. Horses can't run forever and to expect so is, isn't reasonable in this game. I know it took me by surprise for a second, but it challenged me to think about if I needed to run or not sometimes. My only complaint is that the walking horse movement is way less awesome than the running horses. Seriously, cape flying in the wind, hugged up against your mighty steedy, seems way cooler than trotting along.\n\n3. A lot of people seem to be complaining about the lack of explanation going on during the game itself. I will admit, the game doesn't offer much help besides a miniscule tutorial and a few simple instructions. But, I think that's the point of it. You are a monarch trying build (or rebuild?) a kingdom and there's no guidebook to doing so. This game won't hold your hand, it'll toss you out of the nest. It's up to you whether you fly or not. It took me three playthroughs to have SOME understanding of this complex and beautiful game. But that's what I loved about it, I found out how I can lose and came back bigger and stronger each subsquent play through. So if you don't like being thrown out into a world without much help, this game isn't for you.\n\n4. The AI of this game is at best, simple minded. Archers=shoot, Builders=build, farmers= farm etc. This is a pro and a con. Pro because it's easy to understand and work with, con because there's no way to change it up once you make the decision to purchase your choice of simpelton. What I appreciated about it though is that it forces you to consider what your future goals and manage your time. Do you need those archers to hold your wooden wall? Or should you focus on reinforcing those walls instead of having more men to guard them? As previously mentioned, it took me a few tries to understand how much my early game truly effected my gameplay later on.\n\n4A. By managing time I meant how you chose to use ithe simpelton AI. It challenges you to decide what to build, when to build, and where to build. Having walls is nice, but if night time comes and they aren't done, well you're gonna have a bad time. This isn't just for walls as well, there's recruiting, exploration and much more. But t I don't want to spoil too muchmore I know I already have given away a lot.\n\n5. The enemies at times are overwhelming, but sometimes you won't even notice they attacked. It's seemingly arbitrary, and I love that. It keeps you on your toes when considering what is to come the next night. But sometimes, no amount of archer or steady wall is good enough to fend off your foes. They break threw, they beat your people, they pillage, they destroy and they leave. You can't do much about that sometimes. What you can do though, is wipe of the blood and dirt and get back up. Is it going to be easy? Most likely not, unless you have a healthy amount of gold or are lucky enough to find a chest or a merchant. But nothing worth having is easy to get. Sure, it would be nice to have an easy way out and recover everything with one simple click or whatever, but it would for sure not feel the same. I was frustrated, horrified and downright vengeful when I saw those monsters breakthrough. But it didn't stop me, it only motivated me to keep going. Sure I lost in the end, but next time I'll be more prepared to face those devilish raiders. This game isn't forgving, it would be way worse if it was. It is very rewarding though, to feel the sense of victory after fending off a wave, or recovering ground after a devastating loss, I haven't gotten that from a game in a long time.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, didn't really know how else to put it. If there's only one real thing you want to consider before you buy this game, it's whether or not you're ready for a challenge. A very rewarding challenge at that.\n","October 22, 2015","true","13.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The music in this game is amazing, never has music in a game effected about how I feel about my current situation with said game so much. Whether it was when I realized by the sound that a blood moon was near, or when I had heard the sweet sound of those bells signifying I had made it to another day.\n\n2. The 2D side scrolling element keeps you engaged. It keeps you constantly moving or aware of your surroundings. Your kingdom is literally dependent on you, where you go and what you do in a spot will effect your game heavily. With regards to the mighty steed your given, it's just a horse. Horses can't run forever and to expect so is, isn't reasonable in this game. I know it took me by surprise for a second, but it challenged me to think about if I needed to run or not sometimes. My only complaint is that the walking horse movement is way less awesome than the running horses. Seriously, cape flying in the wind, hugged up against your mighty steedy, seems way cooler than trotting along.\n\n3. A lot of people seem to be complaining about the lack of explanation going on during the game itself. I will admit, the game doesn't offer much help besides a miniscule tutorial and a few simple instructions. But, I think that's the point of it. You are a monarch trying build (or rebuild?) a kingdom and there's no guidebook to doing so. This game won't hold your hand, it'll toss you out of the nest. It's up to you whether you fly or not. It took me three playthroughs to have SOME understanding of this complex and beautiful game. But that's what I loved about it, I found out how I can lose and came back bigger and stronger each subsquent play through. So if you don't like being thrown out into a world without much help, this game isn't for you.\n\n4. The AI of this game is at best, simple minded. Archers=shoot, Builders=build, farmers= farm etc. This is a pro and a con. Pro because it's easy to understand and work with, con because there's no way to change it up once you make the decision to purchase your choice of simpelton. What I appreciated about it though is that it forces you to consider what your future goals and manage your time. Do you need those archers to hold your wooden wall? Or should you focus on reinforcing those walls instead of having more men to guard them? As previously mentioned, it took me a few tries to understand how much my early game truly effected my gameplay later on.\n\n4A. By managing time I meant how you chose to use ithe simpelton AI. It challenges you to decide what to build, when to build, and where to build. Having walls is nice, but if night time comes and they aren't done, well you're gonna have a bad time. This isn't just for walls as well, there's recruiting, exploration and much more. But t I don't want to spoil too muchmore I know I already have given away a lot.\n\n5. The enemies at times are overwhelming, but sometimes you won't even notice they attacked. It's seemingly arbitrary, and I love that. It keeps you on your toes when considering what is to come the next night. But sometimes, no amount of archer or steady wall is good enough to fend off your foes. They break threw, they beat your people, they pillage, they destroy and they leave. You can't do much about that sometimes. What you can do though, is wipe of the blood and dirt and get back up. Is it going to be easy? Most likely not, unless you have a healthy amount of gold or are lucky enough to find a chest or a merchant. But nothing worth having is easy to get. Sure, it would be nice to have an easy way out and recover everything with one simple click or whatever, but it would for sure not feel the same. I was frustrated, horrified and downright vengeful when I saw those monsters breakthrough. But it didn't stop me, it only motivated me to keep going. Sure I lost in the end, but next time I'll be more prepared to face those devilish raiders. This game isn't forgving, it would be way worse if it was. It is very rewarding though, to feel the sense of victory after fending off a wave, or recovering ground after a devastating loss, I haven't gotten that from a game in a long time.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, didn't really know how else to put it. If there's only one real thing you want to consider before you buy this game, it's whether or not you're ready for a challenge. A very rewarding challenge at that.\n","October 22, 2015","true","13.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I must admit the game is very challenging and it takes several tries to understand the game mechanisms and refine the optimal strategy, and it can be a bit repetitive at times. However once you understand how the AI behaves and the core gameplay mechanisms then it becomes a fun challenge to destroy the enemy portals in as little time as possible.\n\nPros:\nThe game is very simple and it is easy for new players to understand what the game is about.\nIt is challenging and the player must stay focused at all times, or risk falling behind.\nCons:\nIt is not possible to fall back to previously saved games after you lose your game. So even if you do one silly mistake in an otherwise perfect game you must start over. It would be nice touch to allow players to fall back to the last time they saved.\nThe game is too unforgiving for new players. Allowing the player to adjust the difficulty could be nice.\n\nIf you like resource management/optimization games then this game is definitely worth the $10 price tag.","October 27, 2015","true","13.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you have played games such as Convoy and FTL, this game is kinda the same, but just more toned down. It relies heavily on money, your ability to quickly think and strategies, and, most of all, on you panicking. It also tries you're patience... to the absolute limit. I love how you are forced to explore and think for yourself, not be babysat by the tutorial throughout your first 20 minutes of playing. It's stylistic design and sounds/ music is also a great part of the game, as it can either make you relaxed or tensed at the perfect moments in time, (such as, when there is a blood moon, the sound gets very tense and the night feels darker. When the sun rises, sometimes calming music plays and the scenery erupts into sunlit beauty, mixed with the safe sound of the bells, marking your survival of another day).\n\nThe game allows the character to do what they want, essentially, and doesn't force them to do certain tasks before going on to discover the world the player is in. The game does however make it very irritating when expanding, as you put a lot of your resources at risk. The AI of the characters are irritating at best, however it does make you have to think about when and where you do projects as it may create difficulties.\n\nWhat I would like to see added is just some sort of extra speed mechanic so it doesn't take 5 years to travel from one place to another, and the blood moons are fewer and more spaced out in timing, so new players can easily get engrossed in the game's aspects instead of worrying, "OMG, another blood moon in 5 days, PANIC!!! AAAAAAAH!!!"\n\nApart from small details, I love the game and how it has turned out!

You can spend up to 15 gold if you want that buff to last for 3 days.\n- You need to find the builder statue to make your walls stronger against enemies attack.

Gameplay was exactly the same 45 minutes in as it was 5 minutes in, I mean *exactly*. Because you can't directly (or even indirectly in the case of archers) command any units, you'll simply spend most of the time running back and forth checking to see if anyone drops money for you to use. When you include the fact that your horse can only run so long, and this amount is not shown anywhere, gameplay becomes repetitive very quickly.\n\n-AI is incredibly bad. I'm not sure why some other reviews say this "adds to the game." Artificially increasing difficulty is not a good thing. Expect to spend a good amount of time watching your archers move to one side and shoot your own defenses as the rest of your land is overrun. Maybe if your archers could shoot through your own defenses or at least fire faster this wouldn't be such a big problem, but ultimately it feels like surviving or dying is out of your control entirely.","February 6","false","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","5"

This can make it hard and annoying to play specially on Blood-moons that late in.\n\nI would recomend this game, the devs do listen to what is wrong with the game and are trying to improve them as well as listen to some ideas we have.\nEven in the current state the game is still addicting to play and I am happy to come back and re-try to survive those 100 days or beat my record of the fastest time I have made my kingdom safe.

There isn't much freedom with regard to how you build your castle since that is taken care of by randomly generated "hardpoints" for walls, towers and other buildings which are then built by AI. Some reviews have pointed out that the AI is weak, whereas I would think that the devs want you to really think about your timing with decisions in-game and "wrap" your tactics around AI behavior instead of blaming it for what is perceived as short-sightedness. In example, it is ill-advised to start a construction project on the edges of your base at night time, it will cost you many resources and personel and this is where the game can really put a dent on your run, or even finish it outright.\nLearn from your mistakes when dying in your runs,  due to a lack of in-game knowledge (and/or greed) and start fresh while hopefuly eliminating inefficiencies in your next approach.

And finally, don't upgrade to a stone KEEP until you are ready to defend against the hulks and the flying aliens and conquering a portal is your next step.","October 31, 2015","true","52.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

(And monsters.)\n\nKingdom is one of the most perfect games to show that you don't need 1080p at 60 fps to have a beautiful art style. The simplistic, yet striking graphics immidiately caught my eye and still surprise me while I play, even eleven hours in. The magiacal, story illustration feel of this game adds a level of depth, and creates a gorgeous world in which to build your very own kindom.\n\nGraphics aside, this game seems to have a simplistic gameplay at first, where the tutorial seems to tell you to throw all of your money to peasants and build a few cool little walls. The final words; "Build, Expand, Defend" send you on your way to creating your own kingdom. The game does not tell you any strategies, tips, or what to do next, and finding that out is a large part of the gameplay. Despite getting slightly repetitive after the great effort you put into one kingdom is all for naught when it is brutally destroyed and you have to start over, the game actually gets quite difficult and begins to require serious preparation the farther you get. Actually beating the game is even harder, and I have yet to stick it out long enough to win. (Which you aren't even told how to do!)\n\nOverall this is an absolutely stunning game with beautifully designed gameplay mechanics that you have to figure out for yourself, which makes this game in itself a learning experience. The simplistic style with a challenging objective creates a game that is great fun to play and a tough cookie to crack. The only thing that is wrong (If you can call it 'wrong') with this game is it feels like there could be more to it, but the developers are slowly updating it so that may change.\n\n9/10 I will always keep coming back for more of the amazing graphics and addicting gameplay.","January 3","true","22.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It is this that gives the game a tense feeling as you fight not just to survive, but thrive. Thats what i probably love most about it. its not just holdong out for an amount of days until you die, there is an actual end game where you defeat your enemies. The game is also rather beautiful (im not a huge fan of pixel are) and feels nostalgic like it could have been a sega game 20 years ago.\n\nIll be interested to see where the devs take this game and while at this stage it does feel complete, there is just to much potential for them to stop now.\n\nThe main downfall of this game is that it may get boring over time but for the price id say you are likely to get your moneys worth.\n\nIn summary regardless of your name you should probably buy this game.","October 28, 2015","true","9.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Despite all this I can't really recommend the game. There is no direction for the players. The 30 second tutorial shows you exactly what you can do (move and build) and then explains nothing else leaving it to the player to flounder around in hopes of discovering what they need to do. You will lose your first game, and your second game and your fifth game and so forth until you finally stumble upon the one way the game can be played. There is very little gameplay to it; run left, build things, run right, build things, wait until you have enough money to do it again. Some of your decisions are meaningful, most of them are not. You cant control anything directly and there's no way to know how your kingdom is actually doing unless you walk a mile back and forth to check.

Nevermind that there are almost no instructions, you will learn most of the mechanics in a couple of hours. There are a couple of features that are less than evident, but there is so little to learn at all, you probably won't miss anything in a playthrough.\n\nSecond, it's way too easy to win if you go at it the right way. The difficulty fluctuates, but if you don't make many silly mistakes it's  really hard to lose. Just keep doing the same resource-gathering loop and you're golden. The enemies are more frustrating than dangerous. Some of them can't really be defeated and will take their share of your resources and go away, some are trivial.\n\nThird, there is just too little content. The map is randomized a bit, but in the end, each time it's just a couple of guaranteed features in a slightly different order. The number of buildings you can build is tiny. You don't get to make any tactical decisions apart from ordering an attack. Nothing exciting happens. Sure, sometimes monsters overpower you frontline defense and wreck some part of your kingdom, but it's a temporary setback at worst, often you can rebuild in a day.\n\nAnd the last one, a big one. Ninety-five percent of your time you just gallop left to right, left to right, gathering coins, renewing enhancements, ordering more bows. It's not fun, you can't screw it up, it's just pointless busywork.\n\nAll in all, if you really like the idea, try it, but I'd recommend waiting.

However, after playing for a couple hours it's easy to see the flaws in it. World generation can be incredibly unfair at times, but it's mostly the AI which will have you feeling stressed out. There is simply not enough time to prepare after a certain point, which is not helped by the AI characters being incredibly slow to get anywhere (c'mon, can't you go a little faster when you're under attack?), or they prioritise certain actions to the point of detriment. Engineers, for example, will not bother to retrieve a catapult from a destroyed wall until there's an attack (which will inevitably get them knocked off). Knights will run away like cowards when a wall gets torn down and their stand-by point moves as a result. They turn their backs and end up getting decimated.\n\nHaving people wander off as a result of getting hit and their tools stolen is far too punishing. Chasing after and re-hiring your people is tedious, especially considering how slow they are. And if you've had a bunch of monsters drop items they tried to take off with, such as hammers, you'll end up with an influx of builders you didn't want when you needed archers instead simply because those tools were in the AI's way first.\n\nI think the game needs a lot more rebalancing before it can be considered challenging rather than frustrating.","October 22, 2015","false","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Kingdom is a fun and nice game that lacks replayability and some other stuff I will soon get into.\n\nGoing around building up a kingdom and defending it is always nice. And who doesn't love to have some peasants all do the stuff for you?\nJust that all peasants are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Archers seriously need some freaking training, like building a traning camp or something like that. They are probably made to be this way but that doesn't change the fact that it annoys me. It is frustrating watching two archers needing 10 shots to shoot down one enemy. The warriors you get in the end are tanky but don't seem to know how to use their equipment and just watch most fights. And all of these peasants are SOOOOOO SLOOOOOOOOW, laziest peasants in the universe, and you don't even have a whip to to make them go faster :). And they aint the only ones that are slow, the king or queens horse must have a broken leg or something, but that speed is endurable for me. So well, for you and your peasants it takes a while to get somewhere. Something that annoys me quite a lot is how I can't attack :''(, the king/queen should start out with a little bow that can be upgraded to balance up those pathetic archers. But that's simply one of my ideas and hopes.\n\nThe information that you get feels like nothing.  I got totally wrecked my first games cause I didn't know you could make farms. I even thought the farmers were pikemen until I realized they sucked in combat :(. And when I got through that problem and was going to upgrade my town hall I coulden't. It seems like you had to go to some building and spend some money, information that I didn't get from the game or the internet.\nAnd if you have gotten to day 15 or whatever it is, those Hulk Smashers just wreck your place no matter your defense or army, or maybe I simply haven't gotten any info about that either...\nThough ofcourse it should be taken into consideration that this game is about learning yourself and just starting over game after game to get more knowledge about what to do, it might be that this game just isn't for everyone. Especially people like me who directly looks up on the internet whenever I need to know something...\n\nBefore I got the game I thought I could place my defense and build all the stuff wherever I wanted, but appareantly not! These dumbass random spots with dirt or stone for defenses is just annoying and don't let you build and get your imagination on, cause it is already premade how everything must look, lame.\nSo with every castle looking the same, you doing the same stuff without any exploring this game just lacks the replayability cause it's going to turn out the same everytime you play, atleast from my short game time.\n\nGreat idea though, and I'm sure if the dev's care about the game that they can make it into something awesome, until then, with the price it has, this is going to be a negative review.","January 3","false","4.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","4"

The graphics are excellent, the music and sound fit the atmosphere, and figuring out the games mechanics is a joy.  After that point however, the game is fatally flawed and an absolute chore to play.\n\n1. The game has a huge lack of content.  I had every building built and fully upgraded along with every unit by about day 20 - 25.  I had seen every enemy type by that point as well.  Future days (I am currently on 48) have just had more enemy numbers.\n\n2.  The game requires you to cheese it in order to progress.  For example - I had too many farmers and not enough archers, I was generating 3x as much gold as I could spend per day on replacement soldiers.  There is no way to reasign those farmers, so I had to let the enemy hit them so they would go back to neutral, rehire them, and then give them a bow to make them soldiers.\n\n3.  The game is VERY buggy.  Graphics glitches, animation glitches, AI problems (such as toolless peasants refusing to pick any up making them useless).  Knights only work a part of the time.  Workers will not man catapults at night half the time and so on.  The game also lags noticibly at times past about night 40.\n\n4. Difficulty is not balanced.  In my current game for example I make 3 times the gold I can spend in one day but due to the way the map was layed out I could not expand without leaving myself with almost no way to generate population.  So I cant lose as I can rehire every damanged unit and rebuild every building every day but cant win due to a lack of units.  I am on night 48 and have not made any progress since night 26, no new buildings/upgrades etc to help me win but the AI also cannot do anything due to my ability to rebuild every single day,\n\nTL;DR - Great 1st impression - 3/10 after that - I would strongly advise against buying this game.","October 22, 2015","false","6.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

However, there is very little depth to the game beyond the first 30 min - 1 hour. Game mechanics that at first seem novel quickly become tedious busy work.\n\nYou control an ever expanding city but the game mechanics are inadequate to properly manage the growing city size. As you expand your city, you will spend more and more time running from one side of it to the other. Your coin pouch doesn't expand which means that you'll have to keep running back and forth from the front line constructions to your farmers to collect and spend coins.\n\nThere is also no variety or strategy in building placement and unit types. There are 4 types of units: Builders, Farmers, Archers, and Knights (you can only have 4 Knights at most). There are 3 types of buildings that you can place in predetermined locations: Walls, Towers, and Farms. The buildings all have linear upgrades.\n\nThe only character you can control is yourself. It would be nice to be able to instantly swap from one side of the map to the other. Perhaps they could have added "Commander" or "Messenger" units to the game to help send orders and collect money without needing to walk and do everything in person.\n\nA king needs to be able to delegate tasks. As the kingdom expands, more tasks need to be delegated. Although this game has good art and concept, until the developers add better city management features. I don't recommend playing this game.","October 21, 2015","false","2.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

However, after having "played through it" 3 times now, I feel that it does not offer enough content to be worth $10. The game is very much so a rogue-like, but that isn't the issue. I enjoy rogue-likes. Rather, the game, rather than letting you enjoy the mechanics, forces you to (if you want to survive) not expand in the slightest. You think im kidding? Try it for yourself. The way to do well is to simply upgrade, not cut down a single tree, and not expand past your two initial walls. You don't even need to build towers or farms. Just keep adding people and you have an nigh-unstoppable army. Now this will probably eventually back fire, however, the game does not encourage the use of its own mechanics, hence my negative review. It's fun, but very very black and white in terms of gameplay.","October 21, 2015","false","9.6"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","5"

The game has the most basic of explainations for a much more in depth game. It's like the developers couldn't be ♥♥♥♥ed to explain how to play the game or what anything is. You find stuff randomly that you haven't seen before and you're just suppose to figure out what it does. It's got a cool premise and I like the atmosphere/graphics but I really wish the tutorial explained anything of importance.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSo played the game longer figured out what stuff does (no thanks to the game or the developers but to community guides), I could tell you right now without these guides I'd be lost. This game has so much potential but fell short in so many places, it's honestly really sad because I would've loved it. Right now there's only ONE way to do things, everything else will end up with you losing...which kinda makes it that no matter how you want to play you're going to play in a certain way regardless. So there's no variety to playstyles...which makes the game even more boring to me. For five dollars or less it's a fair price, for ten?

The beatiful art is just the start too the gameplay is a new take on the world of stratgy games. The smplicity makes the game extremely easy and fun to pick up. But there is also flaws in this game, lots of them but I think that just fine being the fact that the time I wrote this te games was in 1.01. After an hour or too playingit kinda becomes repeteative and there is really not much exept to get more people and destoy the portals. And the difficulty canonly be described as brutal. Right when you thinky you have the upper hand, SUPRISE flying enimeis that your arches cant even hit. And then theres the blood moons these cause massive wavs of enimies to come chargeing to your doors and you loose all npcs on the ground for half the kingdom and to make matters worse you cant do anything about it exapt throw your precious coins to make some of them run away with them. So really a option to lower the difficulty or turn of blood moons. This leads to another problem the game has. When you dies you completly restart and that means youhave to cmpletely rebuild and after you restart a couple of times there is nothing left  to do for the game. It becomes Build, Expand, Die, Repeat. An that all it becomes it feels like treadmill you almost finidh then you die and you have to do the samething all over again. And somtimes its not even you fault the archers somtime all go to one side at night and leave one little tower to be massaced and then the enimy breaks through and BAM your dead. What would fix this would be diffrent paths to take like a more industial path a path with magic and a path that you can harness the dark poweres and rule the land as a dark lord/lady and be all awsome and stuff. And if you aded this think of the possiblities hire wizards make giant seige engines and traps and then just make it all one giant sandwich of awesome and BAM you have a great game. So my final rating would be a 8/10\n\nPros:\nGraphics are amazing\nCan run on bad computers\nEasy to learn and play\n\nCons:\nGet very boring and repetative\nStupid NPCs\nYou cant do anything but throw money at stuff\nMore backstory or lore\nNEEDS MAGIC N EXPLOSIONS\n\nOne of the best games I've ever played but needs development and new Ideas","October 31, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game has a beauty to it that's not necessarily tied to its pixel artstyle, but more due to its animation quality and the little touches such as dirt kicking up as you gallop along. And it's a bit different with elements of tower defense, strategy, and base building games all rolled into one. And the game will keep you interest in the same way a game like FTL will keep you interested, by random generation everytime you start a game. Granted you only press 4 buttons the entire game, (left, right, give money, sprint) but i could argue that the Call of Duty could be played with only 5 buttons, (directional keys, Fire). The game shows its interest in the IOS platform because IOS is the future, portable gaming is the future. the game does not have simple gameplay. It is designed to be replayable, after two or three attempts: the game has not shown you entire bag of tricks, and that's an amazing design. Your lack of the control of your units will keep the game difficult, how the people cower from demons of the night and one eyed one horned flying purple people eaters. You will feel as if you need to defend the people from everything that's going on around you.

But this time when I played and got to day 50 all the way to 94, the game started lagging so much that I would be sitting there for five minutes at a time, stuck. This has caused me to be unable to recruit people, give jobs and upgrade my walls and shrines. Also, it would be a good idea to maybe make some of the walls a little closer due to right now, I am trying to defeat my 4th portal and I am unable to due to the fact that the walls are so far apart, unable to protect all my archers and since the last wall is right next to the portal, the monsters can destroy it more easily whilst taking out all my archers since the wall before that is so far away. But the worst part is the lag. It is keeping me from advancing any farther and it happens during day and night. It seems to get worse when people start dropping gold, but I am suprised since that always happens. It may also be a good idea to do something with the horse or the speed or travel time. Once the kingdom starts to really expand, it get's harder and harder to just travel the kingdom. I haven't been able to check the entire left side of my kingdom at all since around day 80 due to the fact that it takes about an entire day to do so, but that prevents me from upgrading and recruiting. I've heard someone talking about a horse shrine; something like that.

And if you aded this think of the possiblities hire wizards make giant seige engines and traps and then just make it all one giant sandwich of awesome and BAM you have a great game. So my final rating would be a 8/10\n\nPros:\nGraphics are amazing\nCan run on bad computers\nEasy to learn and play\n\nCons:\nGet very boring and repetative\nStupid NPCs\nYou cant do anything but throw money at stuff\nMore backstory or lore\nNEEDS MAGIC N EXPLOSIONS\n\nOne of the best games I've ever played but needs development and new Ideas","October 31, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game has zero depth or effort put into anything but the art. The player has next to zero agency with their useless King character, so the gameplay boils down to watching bad AI build things only to watch other, enemy AI come and tear those things down.\n\nThat might sound interesting to someone, so it's important to note that when I say "build things", I'm referring to about 5 'things'. A central building, a wall, a tower, a farm... and maybe one other forgettable, boring thing I'm missing.\n\nIf you've played the game for 30 minutes or so you've seen everything except perhaps the different enemy types, but the enemies aren't interesting either - they have no point, no motivation, no nothing, they're just a destructive force for the sake of having a destructive force in the game.\n\nIn summary, the game is painfully boring in terms of gameplay, and should just be a short film or something.","October 23, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I hate to rate this game poorly since it started out so promising, but its core systems are at odds with each other.\n\nThe game is an empire builder that limits your interaction to a slow moving character who can only pick up and spend money at different locations. What starts out as a fun and exploratory adventure of running back and forth across the map, upgrading buildings, and discovering new advancements, quickly becomes a nightmare of managing a kingdom that is too large to cross in a single day. Honestly this game would have been much better if the physical size of your kingdom didn't grow so large, or the player was given tools to manage at a larger scale. It seems as though the devs wanted to use two incompatible mechanics, but couldn't let go of either one.\n\nLike many other reviews have said, the AI is horribly flawed. If you want to limit player interaction so severely, you need the game to manage itself flawlessly. Anything less is just going to lead to frustration, and believe me this game provides frustration in spades.\n\nFrom playing the game and then reading the developers' community interaction, it seems that the idea of learning the rules through trial and error is core to their design. They insist that everything functions very precisely according to the rules of the game, and that includes the awful AI as well. However this seems like an excuse to explain away some poorly designed systems, and a failure to communicate those systems through the course of gameplay.\n\nOverall I think this game could have been great, but the designers were unwilling to either let go of the game's main gimmick or design the mid to late game experience around that gimmick. They wanted their cake and their kingdom too.","October 26, 2015","false","6.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nicemeem/recommended/368230/","nicemeem","Autistic degenerate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nicemeem/","108 products in account","TL;DR: Don't bother buying this game just yet. Not worth the 10 euros currently. Should be in early access.\n\nQuote from the developer:\n"Sorry, but we will not make an easy mode. Everything behaves predictably. If you tell a worker to do a list of task they will do them. If you build a tower archers will try and fill it. If you build a catapult worker will push it to the furthest palisade. It's all about timing and strategy and in no instance should your hand be held, we have enough of those games already IMO. In short, it's not what this game is about and I promise if you play and really dig into the details you'll master this game and start petitioning for a hard mode. :)"\n\nSo, developers will not add alternative ways of playing just because. Before seeing this, I actually recommended this game.\n\nWhat would easy mode change? Answer: Absolutely nothing. Those who'd like to play this like an E-Sports game, could play this like an E-Sports game, and those who'd want to be more relaxed, could play the easy mode. Everybody freaking wins. Nobody loses. This should be pretty clear.\n\n====================================\n\nAnd now for the actual review and not my rant:\n\nThe game can be played through in less than 2 hours. In less than 2 hours, you will see and learn everything that you can from this game. You will soon find out that if you happen to walk in front of a catapult just at the right moment, the catapult will hit you and your crown will fall right next to the monsters, and you will lose the game, regardless of how good defences you had, or how prepared you were for the night.\n\nThere are 3 different types of monsters. Yep. Three. There are the normal "jumping", running enemies that steal your coins and/or equipment, and then there are the flying monsters that just gobble up your archers and/or builders like no tomorrow, and then there are the "trolls" that just throw rocks (?) at you. That's it for the monsters. They all come from the hell portals, scattered all around the map.\n\nThere are 5 different types of units you can have:\n\n1. First is the archer, his/her aiming abilities are beyond, uhm... dog poo, unless you of course happen to find a shrine that, mind you, RANDOMLY, appears or doesn't appear. It might not even be in your game at all.\n\n2. Then there is the builder, or worker, who builds your walls, towers, catapults, farms, etc. He is the type of person who will go, during the night, to cut down a tree, and then gets killed by the monsters. But canceling worker tasks would be "hand-holding" according to the devs, so, your opinions do not matter. "Our AI is flawless, you are stupid for sending him out during the night", says the developer.\n\n3. Then there is the farmer, who will work on farms that your workers build. Nothing much to say about him, but that if you upgrade the farm to a watermill, he will not come to the town center during the night, but instead will stay at the farm, and die horribly. UNLESS YOU "OF COURSE" WALL HIS FARM IN.\n\n4. And then there's the knight, who will have an army of archers following him, about 4-5 archers max mind you. He is the one that should be sent to destroy the hell portals that the monsters come from. You can spawn him from your town center after you've upgraded the wooden shrine to a stone one, but here's the catch! The shrine might not be there AT ALL! Because that would be hand-holding, wouldn't it now? So, better just restart your game - "We love hearing you cry. Sincerely, devs". You can only have max. of 4 knights at a time.\n\n5. You can also have two catapults, and they do miss regularly. Nothing you can do about that. Builders build, move, and reload them. Mind you, if the catapult is outside your base, your builders will still wander off into the night just to repair them. And then they die. And ain't there nothing you can do about that.\n\nThe building upgrades are linear.\nYou can upgrade (marked with #) and build (marked with *) these:\n- Walls#*\n- Watchtowers#*\n- Town Center#\n- Farms#*\n- Shrines#\n\nTo upgrade the buildings from wooden ones to stone ones, you have to have the wooden shrine upgraded.\n\nYour workers can also cut down trees.\n\nYou can not command your units in any way. Some might argue though that this is a design choice, that the game is "minimalistic", and yeah, it is, but really? Could I just make a game where you just use your arrow keys to move a black square around on a white background, and call the game a "minimalistic adventure-exploration game"? No. There are some things that even minimalistic games should have, and actually, HAVE TO HAVE. And that is simple unit control. Oh, but that would be hand-holding, according to the devs, oh, almost forgot that. Sorry. Nevermind.\n\nThere is only one resource you can gather and use, and that is money. And only one coin purse, and if you fill that up, every extra coin will fall to the river. No hand-holding!\n\nThere is only one gamemode, and that is "normal" mode. Don't like it? Don't buy and/or play our game, sincerely, devs, sincerely, community. No hand-holding!\n\nOptions menu? Uhm... let's just put it this way... doesn't exist..? No resolution options, no nothing. Probably could be considered hand-holding by the devs.\n\nOnly one save slot. Because having more would be hand-holding, oh of course! And you can only load that one save slot.\n\nTranslations are good. Actually was kind of surprised to find a Finnish translation for this game. Great job on those, guys!\n\nIn the end, the game is uhm, let's put it this way, 4/10. Too minimalistic to even be considered minimalistic, dev's don't seem to care about your opinions, there's barely any options menu, too high of a price tag for essentially a flash game. Linear upgrades = not good. Only 3 types of enemies = not good. Only 5 types of units = not good. Translations are good. Please remember though, that these are my opinions. Some people might think that linear upgrades, etc, are actually good. Think that way? Good for you!\n\nOh wow, I used too much of my time on this one "review" (let's just be honest here, a rant). I should really get a life.","October 25, 2015","false","6.4"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","15","30","3","1"

The controls are simple, the game is easy to pick up but hard to master.\nYou are the ruler of a newly founded kingdom, and need to expand it. Explore the lands and bribe people to join your kingdom. But there's a catch: There are four Portals connecting the lands to another realm, inhabited by strange, greedy creatures. You will have to destroy all the portals to secure your newfound lands.\n\nThe game mainly focuses on proper ressource management and timing your actions right. Upgrading a wall at the wrong time and you can potentially use half of your forces!

And without a ruler, there cannot be a kingdom!\nThere are many subtle elements in the world, especially in the deep forest areas, hinting at what kinds of buildings you'll be able to build once you clear the forest - Or clearings in the woods, potentially allowing you to include camps where you can recruit peasants into the safety of your kingdom.\n\nThe pixel art is lovely and the soundtrack really adds to the game - Too bad you don't get to hear it all the time..","October 22, 2015","true","29.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's packed full of little jems. I really enjoy the art style as well as the soundtrack. It gives off a kind of nostalgia for me. When I was growing up one of my favorite games was/is Civilization. I'm not saying this game is  in anyway near as big. Civilization is all about making the right moves to build your settlement to a Dynasty that could last for centuries. Kingdom scratches that building itch. However its not about keeping your kingdom its about taking down the nasty creatures that come every night attacking your home. In fact the game encourages that you live longer if you manage really well at the start. Exploration in your realm is necessary as well as taking risks. There is a time factor in this as well so your decision making has to be on point or your could lose big time and not recover. I believe this game is meant to be played again and again because each restart gives you a different layout. There are few irritating things that are really nit picking. For instance sometimes when my builders chop down trees sometimes coins come out however when I walk over it with my horse sometimes it picks it up right away other times I have to go back and forth several times. In this game time matters so me spending my time trying to pick up one coin can be frustrating.

You see, to be able to win, you have to destroy four portals, two in each direction, and to do that, you have to send out knights with archers.\n\nYou can only do this during the day, though, as they need to be standing by the standard outside your outer walls for you to send them out. They only LEAVE the walls after the bells that anounce the day has rung, and there's some type of bug where those bells sometimes don't ring until it's ♥♥♥♥ing midday!\n\nThe reason it's so important to send them out  as the sun goes up is that if you don't, you'll have to expand for them to reach the outer portal before the night attack arrives and woops the asses of your knights with pure numbers! As long as they start attacking the portal, you're golden, the enemies won't come until the portal explodes, upon which it floods out like some kind of tidal wave, even if it turns night or not.\n\nI tried to do a speed run, got a GOLDEN start, wiped the asses of the portals to the left and the first to the right before the 15th day had passed, and then all hell broke loose. Each time it would turn day, the bellringer was taking a ♥♥♥♥ing nap or something, because the crackpots wouldn't ring until a few minutes into the day!! Considering that the day is like 5 min, that's quite alot. Each time I was able to, I sent out my knights, but as they're slower than a snail, they where barely getting close to the portal each time, before it turned night, and a wave of monsters or trolls I don't ♥♥♥♥ing care, came and wooped their ♥♥♥!!\n\nThis went on until day 30, where I rage quit, because day 30 was the day I beat it on the time when I didn't rush, and expanded all the ♥♥♥♥ing way to the portals!!\n\nAlso, once you defeat the game, there's no way of doing anything at all! The camera zips through the world, from your character, to the left- or rightmost camp, depending on which side you beat first, and then zips right back to you, whereupon it stops, with the controls inactive. The game seems to still be running, but you can't do anything but awkwardly stare at your avatar, noticing details you didn't notice during the entire game, waiting for something to happen. In the end, I had to alt+f4 to close the stupid game!\n\n7/10 great game, but wait for the bug fixes if you want to speed run...","October 27, 2015","true","13.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game has a beauty to it that's not necessarily tied to its pixel artstyle, but more due to its animation quality and the little touches such as dirt kicking up as you gallop along. And it's a bit different with elements of tower defense, strategy, and base building games all rolled into one. And the game will keep you interest in the same way a game like FTL will keep you interested, by random generation everytime you start a game. Granted you only press 4 buttons the entire game, (left, right, give money, sprint) but i could argue that the Call of Duty could be played with only 5 buttons, (directional keys, Fire). The game shows its interest in the IOS platform because IOS is the future, portable gaming is the future. the game does not have simple gameplay. It is designed to be replayable, after two or three attempts: the game has not shown you entire bag of tricks, and that's an amazing design. Your lack of the control of your units will keep the game difficult, how the people cower from demons of the night and one eyed one horned flying purple people eaters. You will feel as if you need to defend the people from everything that's going on around you.

It's packed full of little jems. I really enjoy the art style as well as the soundtrack. It gives off a kind of nostalgia for me. When I was growing up one of my favorite games was/is Civilization. I'm not saying this game is  in anyway near as big. Civilization is all about making the right moves to build your settlement to a Dynasty that could last for centuries. Kingdom scratches that building itch. However its not about keeping your kingdom its about taking down the nasty creatures that come every night attacking your home. In fact the game encourages that you live longer if you manage really well at the start. Exploration in your realm is necessary as well as taking risks. There is a time factor in this as well so your decision making has to be on point or your could lose big time and not recover. I believe this game is meant to be played again and again because each restart gives you a different layout. There are few irritating things that are really nit picking. For instance sometimes when my builders chop down trees sometimes coins come out however when I walk over it with my horse sometimes it picks it up right away other times I have to go back and forth several times. In this game time matters so me spending my time trying to pick up one coin can be frustrating. I'm sure the developers can easily fix this issue along with some other glitches.\nThis game gets a 9/10.","October 27, 2015","true","53.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You see, to be able to win, you have to destroy four portals, two in each direction, and to do that, you have to send out knights with archers.\n\nYou can only do this during the day, though, as they need to be standing by the standard outside your outer walls for you to send them out. They only LEAVE the walls after the bells that anounce the day has rung, and there's some type of bug where those bells sometimes don't ring until it's ♥♥♥♥ing midday!\n\nThe reason it's so important to send them out  as the sun goes up is that if you don't, you'll have to expand for them to reach the outer portal before the night attack arrives and woops the asses of your knights with pure numbers! As long as they start attacking the portal, you're golden, the enemies won't come until the portal explodes, upon which it floods out like some kind of tidal wave, even if it turns night or not.\n\nI tried to do a speed run, got a GOLDEN start, wiped the asses of the portals to the left and the first to the right before the 15th day had passed, and then all hell broke loose. Each time it would turn day, the bellringer was taking a ♥♥♥♥ing nap or something, because the crackpots wouldn't ring until a few minutes into the day!! Considering that the day is like 5 min, that's quite alot. Each time I was able to, I sent out my knights, but as they're slower than a snail, they where barely getting close to the portal each time, before it turned night, and a wave of monsters or trolls I don't ♥♥♥♥ing care, came and wooped their ♥♥♥!!\n\nThis went on until day 30, where I rage quit, because day 30 was the day I beat it on the time when I didn't rush, and expanded all the ♥♥♥♥ing way to the portals!!\n\nAlso, once you defeat the game, there's no way of doing anything at all! The camera zips through the world, from your character, to the left- or rightmost camp, depending on which side you beat first, and then zips right back to you, whereupon it stops, with the controls inactive. The game seems to still be running, but you can't do anything but awkwardly stare at your avatar, noticing details you didn't notice during the entire game, waiting for something to happen. In the end, I had to alt+f4 to close the stupid game!\n\n7/10 great game, but wait for the bug fixes if you want to speed run...","October 27, 2015","true","13.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game has zero depth or effort put into anything but the art. The player has next to zero agency with their useless King character, so the gameplay boils down to watching bad AI build things only to watch other, enemy AI come and tear those things down.\n\nThat might sound interesting to someone, so it's important to note that when I say "build things", I'm referring to about 5 'things'. A central building, a wall, a tower, a farm... and maybe one other forgettable, boring thing I'm missing.\n\nIf you've played the game for 30 minutes or so you've seen everything except perhaps the different enemy types, but the enemies aren't interesting either - they have no point, no motivation, no nothing, they're just a destructive force for the sake of having a destructive force in the game.\n\nIn summary, the game is painfully boring in terms of gameplay, and should just be a short film or something.","October 23, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I hate to rate this game poorly since it started out so promising, but its core systems are at odds with each other.\n\nThe game is an empire builder that limits your interaction to a slow moving character who can only pick up and spend money at different locations. What starts out as a fun and exploratory adventure of running back and forth across the map, upgrading buildings, and discovering new advancements, quickly becomes a nightmare of managing a kingdom that is too large to cross in a single day. Honestly this game would have been much better if the physical size of your kingdom didn't grow so large, or the player was given tools to manage at a larger scale. It seems as though the devs wanted to use two incompatible mechanics, but couldn't let go of either one.\n\nLike many other reviews have said, the AI is horribly flawed. If you want to limit player interaction so severely, you need the game to manage itself flawlessly. Anything less is just going to lead to frustration, and believe me this game provides frustration in spades.\n\nFrom playing the game and then reading the developers' community interaction, it seems that the idea of learning the rules through trial and error is core to their design. They insist that everything functions very precisely according to the rules of the game, and that includes the awful AI as well. However this seems like an excuse to explain away some poorly designed systems, and a failure to communicate those systems through the course of gameplay.\n\nOverall I think this game could have been great, but the designers were unwilling to either let go of the game's main gimmick or design the mid to late game experience around that gimmick. They wanted their cake and their kingdom too.","October 26, 2015","false","6.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The beatiful art is just the start too the gameplay is a new take on the world of stratgy games. The smplicity makes the game extremely easy and fun to pick up. But there is also flaws in this game, lots of them but I think that just fine being the fact that the time I wrote this te games was in 1.01. After an hour or too playingit kinda becomes repeteative and there is really not much exept to get more people and destoy the portals. And the difficulty canonly be described as brutal. Right when you thinky you have the upper hand, SUPRISE flying enimeis that your arches cant even hit. And then theres the blood moons these cause massive wavs of enimies to come chargeing to your doors and you loose all npcs on the ground for half the kingdom and to make matters worse you cant do anything about it exapt throw your precious coins to make some of them run away with them. So really a option to lower the difficulty or turn of blood moons. This leads to another problem the game has. When you dies you completly restart and that means youhave to cmpletely rebuild and after you restart a couple of times there is nothing left  to do for the game. It becomes Build, Expand, Die, Repeat. An that all it becomes it feels like treadmill you almost finidh then you die and you have to do the samething all over again. And somtimes its not even you fault the archers somtime all go to one side at night and leave one little tower to be massaced and then the enimy breaks through and BAM your dead. What would fix this would be diffrent paths to take like a more industial path a path with magic and a path that you can harness the dark poweres and rule the land as a dark lord/lady and be all awsome and stuff. And if you aded this think of the possiblities hire wizards make giant seige engines and traps and then just make it all one giant sandwich of awesome and BAM you have a great game. So my final rating would be a 8/10\n\nPros:\nGraphics are amazing\nCan run on bad computers\nEasy to learn and play\n\nCons:\nGet very boring and repetative\nStupid NPCs\nYou cant do anything but throw money at stuff\nMore backstory or lore\nNEEDS MAGIC N EXPLOSIONS\n\nOne of the best games I've ever played but needs development and new Ideas","October 31, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nicemeem/recommended/368230/","nicemeem","Autistic degenerate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nicemeem/","108 products in account","TL;DR: Don't bother buying this game just yet. Not worth the 10 euros currently. Should be in early access.\n\nQuote from the developer:\n"Sorry, but we will not make an easy mode. Everything behaves predictably. If you tell a worker to do a list of task they will do them. If you build a tower archers will try and fill it. If you build a catapult worker will push it to the furthest palisade. It's all about timing and strategy and in no instance should your hand be held, we have enough of those games already IMO. In short, it's not what this game is about and I promise if you play and really dig into the details you'll master this game and start petitioning for a hard mode. :)"\n\nSo, developers will not add alternative ways of playing just because. Before seeing this, I actually recommended this game.\n\nWhat would easy mode change? Answer: Absolutely nothing. Those who'd like to play this like an E-Sports game, could play this like an E-Sports game, and those who'd want to be more relaxed, could play the easy mode. Everybody freaking wins. Nobody loses. This should be pretty clear.\n\n====================================\n\nAnd now for the actual review and not my rant:\n\nThe game can be played through in less than 2 hours. In less than 2 hours, you will see and learn everything that you can from this game. You will soon find out that if you happen to walk in front of a catapult just at the right moment, the catapult will hit you and your crown will fall right next to the monsters, and you will lose the game, regardless of how good defences you had, or how prepared you were for the night.\n\nThere are 3 different types of monsters. Yep. Three. There are the normal "jumping", running enemies that steal your coins and/or equipment, and then there are the flying monsters that just gobble up your archers and/or builders like no tomorrow, and then there are the "trolls" that just throw rocks (?) at you. That's it for the monsters. They all come from the hell portals, scattered all around the map.\n\nThere are 5 different types of units you can have:\n\n1. First is the archer, his/her aiming abilities are beyond, uhm... dog poo, unless you of course happen to find a shrine that, mind you, RANDOMLY, appears or doesn't appear. It might not even be in your game at all.\n\n2. Then there is the builder, or worker, who builds your walls, towers, catapults, farms, etc. He is the type of person who will go, during the night, to cut down a tree, and then gets killed by the monsters. But canceling worker tasks would be "hand-holding" according to the devs, so, your opinions do not matter. "Our AI is flawless, you are stupid for sending him out during the night", says the developer.\n\n3. Then there is the farmer, who will work on farms that your workers build. Nothing much to say about him, but that if you upgrade the farm to a watermill, he will not come to the town center during the night, but instead will stay at the farm, and die horribly. UNLESS YOU "OF COURSE" WALL HIS FARM IN.\n\n4. And then there's the knight, who will have an army of archers following him, about 4-5 archers max mind you. He is the one that should be sent to destroy the hell portals that the monsters come from. You can spawn him from your town center after you've upgraded the wooden shrine to a stone one, but here's the catch! The shrine might not be there AT ALL! Because that would be hand-holding, wouldn't it now? So, better just restart your game - "We love hearing you cry. Sincerely, devs". You can only have max. of 4 knights at a time.\n\n5. You can also have two catapults, and they do miss regularly. Nothing you can do about that. Builders build, move, and reload them. Mind you, if the catapult is outside your base, your builders will still wander off into the night just to repair them. And then they die. And ain't there nothing you can do about that.\n\nThe building upgrades are linear.\nYou can upgrade (marked with #) and build (marked with *) these:\n- Walls#*\n- Watchtowers#*\n- Town Center#\n- Farms#*\n- Shrines#\n\nTo upgrade the buildings from wooden ones to stone ones, you have to have the wooden shrine upgraded.\n\nYour workers can also cut down trees.\n\nYou can not command your units in any way. Some might argue though that this is a design choice, that the game is "minimalistic", and yeah, it is, but really? Could I just make a game where you just use your arrow keys to move a black square around on a white background, and call the game a "minimalistic adventure-exploration game"? No. There are some things that even minimalistic games should have, and actually, HAVE TO HAVE. And that is simple unit control. Oh, but that would be hand-holding, according to the devs, oh, almost forgot that. Sorry. Nevermind.\n\nThere is only one resource you can gather and use, and that is money. And only one coin purse, and if you fill that up, every extra coin will fall to the river. No hand-holding!\n\nThere is only one gamemode, and that is "normal" mode. Don't like it? Don't buy and/or play our game, sincerely, devs, sincerely, community. No hand-holding!\n\nOptions menu? Uhm... let's just put it this way... doesn't exist..? No resolution options, no nothing. Probably could be considered hand-holding by the devs.\n\nOnly one save slot. Because having more would be hand-holding, oh of course! And you can only load that one save slot.\n\nTranslations are good. Actually was kind of surprised to find a Finnish translation for this game. Great job on those, guys!\n\nIn the end, the game is uhm, let's put it this way, 4/10. Too minimalistic to even be considered minimalistic, dev's don't seem to care about your opinions, there's barely any options menu, too high of a price tag for essentially a flash game. Linear upgrades = not good. Only 3 types of enemies = not good. Only 5 types of units = not good. Translations are good. Please remember though, that these are my opinions. Some people might think that linear upgrades, etc, are actually good. Think that way? Good for you!\n\nOh wow, I used too much of my time on this one "review" (let's just be honest here, a rant).

You need to buy and equip your 'bought' people with either a hammer, to build and repair walls, farms, and etc, or a bow to fight off the ghosts when night comes. So far, I've found out  some tactics to maintain the villiage so that it is not too big to control. However, you need to know that certain point to stop expanding too much too fast, having not enough people or missing the right timing for archers to wear off the ghosts.

Certain mechanics are there just to screw you over, for example the catapult that kills all your units, repeatedly, until it's the only unit remaining on the field, and get swarmed by the enemies, which it didn't kill. Or the workers that go out during the night, just to be killed 3 seconds later. Or the orders that cannot be canceled, be it constructions, recruitments or wood cutting. Or the absolutely dreadful aim of the archers (your main and only weapon). At least, if the player was something more than a peasant walking on a horse, it could offset some of the problems of the AI.

How far will my horse gallop?  How much can I expand before I can no longer recruit guys?  What things are actually effective?  How do I get to the options menu when I am stuck watching the intro?  Best of luck!  I made it rather far simply by spending loads of money on all the things.  A strategy that worked well until my own catapults destroyed my own walls and then I found out I could no longer recruit more guys because I expanded too far.  Sucks to be me.  Based on my criticisms you might assume the fix would be to just reveal all the information, but I suspect that would reveal a rather barren game.  The only real roadblocks on the road to an insta-win are some light stratergery and having everything obfuscated by some pleasant art direction.

Currently the game only lasts for a couple hours before it becomes completely reparative. The randomness to where things spawn and the fact that you can't control your troops takes most of the strategy out of this game. In fact the only type of late game strategy is running to camps during the day to get more troops and dropping coins on the ground during the night so your defenses won’t get overrun (some enemies will take the coins and run back to the spawner instead of attacking).\n\nHalf the time walls and watch towers will spawn so far apart there's no way for you to guard them without relying on the AI to wander over there. Coupled with that your archers are terrible shots, it sometimes takes 5 archers multiple shots to take out one enemy. This can be solved if you get lucky enough to have an archer shrine spawn by your base, which makes them great shots, however by that time your kingdom is usually so spread out you still have to rely on the terrible AI grouping up enough to fend off the hordes of enemies. Right now it's a game of running from point A to point B over and over again, while hoping you can recruit enough people to win before days 20/30 when the enemies vastly outscale your army and it becomes very hard to win. I think this game has a lot of potential and I look forward to any updates the developers put out, however right now the game is just way too shallow to be entertaining for more than a couple hours.","October 23, 2015","false","5.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Rather by your tactics the way the map and avaiable terrain is genrated, and luck what the AI decides to do in any given moment will make the difference if you win or loose.\n\nYou can have the strongest walls and the most archers and catapults, you have no real infulence over making real tactical decisions. There is also not really any worth in building multiple walls since when the enemy has taken down your outer most defence, where most of your soldiers will accumulate if it makes sense or not, you will not have enough in the inside to stop the onslaught. That WILL send you on a inevitable and tiresome way to a loss you may as well just start new.\n\nAs if the minor influence you really have on this isn't enough he later the game the more unbalanced the game gets. In later stages you get flying enemys that simply will swoop down and right out wat all your units.\nSince there is no real stacked defences, because all soldiers accumulate more or les in one spot on the outer walls, and your soldiers miss more then hit anything, there is no way you can stop them and get them back, leading you AGAIN on an inevitable path down.\n\nI have no problems with games that are hard and where an early decision can cost you a game later on. The things is that ususlaly such a game gives you tools to work against that, But in Kingdome everything is set up in a way that there is simply no way you can catch up or at least recover from a beating.\n\nAGain the games balance is rubbish, so it doesn't sadly help that the game is utterly gorgeous in effects and animations and has an really wonderfull soundtrack.","April 6","false","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After putting in about 3 sessions now, I've enjoyed my time with the game quite a lot. And I should mention that I'm not typically someone that enjoys the rogue like formula.

I also wish the horse could would pick up money much easier.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradeswithbadhands/recommended/368230/","comradeswithbadhands","KickPunch Dangerous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradeswithbadhands/","208 products in account","TL;DR  If your builders would move with even the smallest sense of urgency, and if your archers could manage to hit enemies more than once every ten shots, this game wouldn't be so bad. Agreeing with a lot of the reviews I've seen, the AI for your allies is abysmal at best. This makes the game honestly not very fun. The art style is beautiful, and the soundtrack can keep my attention the whole time, but as it stands there too many issues to merit a recommendation.\n\n\nYour Character\n\nYou start out as either a king or queen, which is random at the start. You ride on horseback at all times, dole out tasks to your followers, and carry a torch at night. That is literally everything there is for your character to do. You have no offense, no defense an can only take if I remember correctly, two or three hits. Once you've been hit a few times, your crown falls off and you have to race to retrieve it before the enemies do. If they manage to get to it before you, you have no way of getting it back unless by some miracle your archers manage to kill them while they run away. Since your archers miss nine times out of ten, you can be sure that that's the end of the game and you must start over. This can happen on day one if you stray too far from camp, without warning.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game has a day and night system that passes rather quickly, maybe even too quickly, giving you a sense of time management and making you feel like you need to rush just to survive.\n\nDuring the day your builders do what they can to complete the tasks you've given them, and archers wander around and hunt, gathering gold. Farmers will wander out to farm, collecting gold as well. Every morning there is also a chest of gold next to the fire in the center of camp. Gold is essential for literally everything you do, because without it you cannot give orders. Every task costs a certain amount of gold, and every upgrade to a fortification costs more than the last.\n\nAt night your allies  should  return to camp and get ready to defend what they've built. However, this is not always what happens. You have no control over where your allies go or how they prioritize tasks. Because of this, all too often your archers stay outside the camp walls, leaving themselves in the open for a  100% chance to die.  Your builders do seem to stay within the walls most of the time, but when those walls are attacked they saunter over to repair them with such indifference that the walls are usually destroyed before they get there. Other times they will wander outside the walls to do god knows what, and die immediately by the enemy's hand. Farmers either cower in fear, or continue to farm outside the walls and, of course, die. By night five your camp is attacked by so many enemies at once that if you haven't set up camp just perfectly, or if your archers decide they don't want to kill anyone, the moment one wall is broken you can guarantee you've just lost and will have to start over entirely.\n\nTo give that some perspective, I reached night five in about 15-20 minutes. Some might say that is enough time to understand the basic mechanics of any game, and I would agree if not for the fact that this game throws new things at you every few minutes without any hint as to what they are. New fortification options pop into existence and cost on average five gold. At any given time I usually had a maximum of ten gold, so I always felt a bit hesitant to waste gold on something when I didn't know its purpose. I understand that the game is supposed to feel minimalist and rogue-like, but if you're not going to give a blatant tutorial for new objects, you then need to integrate their tutorial or at least some hint on their function into the gameplay in some way without forcing the player to waste precious resources just to learn their function.\n\nAs an example, two large arrow signs popped up in a section of my camp, one pointing left and the other pointing right. Next to them was a ladder and a stack of what looked like lumber and bricks. They each cost six gold to build whatever mystery object they represent. I was hesitant to build them at first, because you don't get very much gold each day. I eventually caved and bought one, wasting most of the gold I had gathered. It ended up being a catapult with which my builders could use to miss every single shot against the enemies outside the walls.\n\nSeriously, they never hit a  single  enemy with them.\n\nI found myself distracted with yelling in my head at the NPC's to actually do their jobs, and because of that was unfortunately not even remotely impressed by what aesthetically is a very beautiful and relaxing game. It is gorgeous, the animation is very smooth and peaceful to look at. However such glaring flaws as little to no freedom, terrible AI, and a king/queen who without any explanation has zero ability to defend themselves, really detract from the atmosphere that the art style portrays.\n\nIf you don't mind playing as a useless and defenseless two-hit hero doling out tasks to a seemingly indifferent band of recruits, fighting enemies that move so quickly compared to your allies you would swear they were agents from the Matrix, then you might enjoy this game. If you also don't mind having no clue what each new thing that pops up does, and having to waste gold on things you don't need just learn their function, you might enjoy this game even more. Now, if having to die a number of times to learn what each different things does is what rogue-like means, then consider my review invalid. If that is what this game is supposed to be then I understand. That doesn't mean I'll change my mind, but I get it. Even taking that thought into consideration, there are too many huge problems with the gameplay mechanics.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMy recommendation to the developers would be to make some serious fixes to the ally AI and movement speeds, and to at least put in a slightly transparent title over new fortifications. Perhaps the titles could appear only if you stand next to their build spots for a few seconds, or even have the title appear only for a few seconds the first time you encounter them. Or give us the freedom to place defenses where we want to place them using a simple menu system. Add gold reward systems for doing things a king or queen would actually do and take away the necessity to micromanage every piece of the kingdom.\n\nThese are just my thoughts and opinions, feel free to tell me to go to hell. I've never made a game so I can't say I know how difficult it is.","January 18","false","0.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I watched an archer miss a rabbit 9 times in a row and another archer stand behind a wall shooting it instead of monsters for a minute strait.  The game could be amazing but I am left with a bitter irritating experience of watching the AI ♥♥♥♥ the bed the entire time.\n\nOn top of this the prevalence of blood moon nights is absurdly high.  I feel a sense of progression whenever it is a normal moon, we get attacked, we take losses, we rebuild.  When a blood moon comes through you get an insane amount of monsters that kill everyone and destroy everything in their path.  There is no defensive option for this besides running and blowing all your gold the next day to get back a portion of what you lost.

I did struggle at first, it was a little frustrating without further guidance apart from the simple tutorial at start but it has very intricate design, EXTREMELY well-designed mechanics yet once again simple, I could make a simple walk through if i wanted to about this game as i just beat my first game after failing 5 more before, but that's the fun of this particular game!\n\nIt has engrossed me in the environment and gameplay for hours on end, i feel that if they got a strong, dedicated team together they could build onto this into a finely tuned and detailed 3D like-minded game with much more to do! But sadly its simple side-scrolling and graphics holds it behind as well to expand on, they have pretty much come to what would seem their limit to expand on this simple game but I had a massive blast!\n\nTo those who thumb down this game and feel it's too hard to play, it's not as hard as you think! First step would be to build up a STRONG military force, keep your builders on a small amount until you have built up a huge force of archers, expand your camp but dont go too fast outwards! If you move too fast you can summon very strong hordes too fast for you to handle, and it's fine if you have TOO MUCH money, but your main key in the late game is PEOPLE PEOPLE PEOPLE as you progress you will lose your troops and people quite fast if not careful, explore how the farming works too, (only upgrade farms to the next level if the farm is behind defendable walls and forces, your farmers will stay there after the day is done, so you may see how this is bad outside of your walls!)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DanilaK/recommended/368230/","DanilaK","Lucifer Morningstar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DanilaK/","21 products in account","Introduction\n\nKingdom is a 2D, side-scrolling strategy game where you take on the role of king or queen of a kingdom (I’ll just refer to your character as king from now on for simplicity). As king it’s your job to help your kingdom grow as well as protect said kingdom from the evil forces lurking deep in the forest. All you have is your crown and an empty coin sack. Collect coins throughout the world and spend them on upgrades for you kingdom, don’t be afraid to use them all but be aware, the loss of your crown means the loss of everything.\n\nPresentation\n\nKingdom has a truly beautiful pixel art style throughout. There’s really not much to say here other than it really does look fantastic. The only UI elements in the game is the coin sack (visible when collecting or spending coins) and the empty coin slots that appear when you’re next to something that can be purchased to show you how much it costs.\n\nGameplay\n\nI’d just briefly like to say I won’t cover much past what you discover in the first half an hour or so in this section of my review. One of Kingdom’s main ‘selling-points’ is that you’re given next to no information about the game and so it’s very much about discovering how to do different things by yourself.\n\nYou walk through your kingdom while mounted on a horse, collecting coins from your people and then using those coins to bring more workers to your kingdom or to build/upgrade structures. You then have to defend your kingdom from attacking enemies. That is, effectively, the entire game. Of course it’s not quite so straightforward.\n\nIn the early days of a game there’s very little threat to your kingdom from what I like to call the dark forces lurking in the forest (we’ll call them monsters from now on). Without much threat from the monsters this really is the best time to get a solid foundation for your kingdom laid down. While you won’t have the resources to build the more advanced structures you’ll be able to build basic guard towers and basic wooden walls to keep the monstrous onslaught at bay. But what good are defences if you have no one to build them or man them? Well I’m glad you asked! To the left and right of your kingdom’s main building you’ll find many things including small encampments with people. These people will come work for you in your kingdom for the small fee of one gold coin. Returning to your kingdom you’ll want to buy the necessary tools for them to do the job you desire. Need more builders? Buy some hammers from the vendor in your village. Need more archers? Buy some bows from the vendor in your village! You get the idea.\n\nNow things aren’t going to be this easy forever. The game gets progressively more difficult with the passing of each day and after just a couple of days you’ll be facing monsters looking to steal whatever they can get their horrible little hands on!\n\nAs I eluded to, there is a fair bit more in the game but I wouldn’t want to spoil it for prospective players but fear not, there is more to the game than I’ve already mentioned.\n\nYou can probably guess from how I’ve written about the gameplay that I’ve enjoyed playing the game, and I have. However, Kingdom did start to feel quite monotonous to me later in the game. Sure the difficulty is ramped up so there’s more pressure on you to build a village capable of fighting off the monsters and protecting the kingdom as a whole but Kingdom effectively descends into you doing the exact same thing each and every day. Perhaps I’m expecting too much from a game with a pretty simple premised and I imagine a lot of people will disagree with me on this but I don’t want to spend each in game day doing the same route to collect money from my people and then spending that money in the exact same way.\n\nAudio\n\nKingdom’s audio department is truly fantastic. The sound effects throughout the game are all fantastic but what really makes this game’s audio shine is the fantastic soundtrack, some of which can be found on ToyTree Music’s YouTube channel. They really nailed the soundtrack for this one.\n\nVerdict\n\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nKingdom is a great 2D, side-scrolling strategy game with a fantastic pixel art style, fun gameplay and lots to discover. While I don’t think it has bucket-loads of replayability it’s certainly enjoyable for several hours and is well worth your time and money.","March 21","true","18.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At first the music dlc ticked me off. But the full experience was well worth the price. 25 hours later and I have every achievement and am awaiting to see if they tackle the late game lag that ensues around day 90+. No crashes, not an early access title and last the developers are actually still working on adding content to their finished product + bug patching.\n\nOnly downside is the lag you will get if you manage to get past day 90 ( It drops 1-2fps when combat happens).

The minimalist game style is also relaxing and makes it a unique experience. Game mechanic is simple and probably creative.\n\nThen why am I not recommending the game? It's the damn archers I keep hiring and losing. As you play early on in the game, the archer is the only defense you can own. They are really slow and they will never manage to kill a monster unless they stay behind a wall or on a tower. They also MISS a lot of shots. Once a red moon rise, I quickly lose all men, tools and walls. Monsters are way too fast and the archer AI can do no ♥♥♥♥ if there are no walls.\n\nI will take another shot at the game and perhaps I will watch a YouTube guide to see if my playstyle is correct or not.

Is it a rougelike or a kingdom builder? There are elements of both, but unfortunately neither succeed. While the game is difficult at first, that's mainly because of the near total lack of tutorial. A quick look at a wiki or subreddit will give you a good grasp of the basics, and from there it's merely a game of optimization.\n\nBut here is where the balance between rougelike and kingdom builder runs into trouble. If this was more like a rougelike, and you died more, it would be fun to work on optimizing your build, strategizing and trying new things in order to reach the end game. But once you're over the initial difficulty curve, it isn't difficult to survive to the mid-late game. But even when you reach the end game, there isn't really anything to do. I quickly ran out of a goals besides expanding more, which quickly becomes a dull grind with no end in sight.\n\nAdmittedly, part of the allure of the game lies in the discovery aspect, and the devs seem committed to building out the endgame. And the game is beautiful. Extremely simple but well animated ever changing weather makes the experience great. For $5 (on sale when I purchased it), you could certainly do a lot worse.

There is some "random generation" of places to put towers and walls, but it doesn't seem to get in the way of major gameplay most of the time - begging the question as to why it's random in the first place. I suspect it's there for the same reason as the "super mysterious lack of rules" - to obfuscate the sheer simplicity of the mechanics. Because once you get the gist of it and realize the end goal, it switches from interesting discovery to tedium and being severely punished for small missteps (or in my case, building too fast because "waiting patiently for your minions to adjust for 10 minutes" is not my idea of fun). You will also get to experience the joy of riding an asthmatic horse who tires out after a light jog, a horse which you will use to cross ever increasingly large distances.\n\nI won't go into detail over the specifics, in case you'd like to do the whole "discovery" thing, but essentially the game goes expand -> introduce annoyances ->  expand -> more annoyances, severe catastrophe -> repeat until optimized.\n\nThe atmosphere, music and style are good - and it's fairly solid bugs-wise, which I have to give credit for given some of the rubbish currently on steam. I also know there are people who enjoy tedium and minutia, and will love this game. But this review is more for people who don't consider alphabatizing their rock collection a fun way to pass their time.\n\nIt passes in it's function as something to distract you for a while.

This wouldn't necessarily be a problem, as often you can intuit the function of something from the game. This is not the case for Kingdom. There are many buildings and upgrades that you only buy to try and guess - most of which are absolutely crucial to your success.\n\nSomewhat counter-intuitively, the game punishes expansion by removing your source of new peasants, and adding only one relatively late game option for traveling quickly across your vast kingdom, making the bulk of the game a "Manage the Horse's Stamina Simulator". This is offset by the massive amount of income that expansion can bring. Income that - after a point - becomes needlessly excessive (example: If the player chooses to expand vastly in one direction, the entire farmer class becomes unnecessary, due to the prevalence of rabbits, which net 1 gold each).\n\nTo top it off, the game is short. VERY short. And it offers little in the way of replay value.\n\nIn summary: I might pay $2 for this as a mobile game.

The music never really stood out to me, though....\n\nThis game has no difficulty curve, it instead has a difficulty slight incline leading to a difficulty vertical brick wall. You gallop around the countryside, never too fast on your apparently arthritic horse, using nothing but money to do everything. There are enemies you cannot fight or keep up with, which you must rely on your hired help to dispatch. The  AI's aim (which only matters for your side) is terrible.\n\nI wanted to like this game, and it was cool for the first maybe 20 minutes. At night (just like in minecraft) the monsters come, and usually they're not really a problem, but they can steal money and tools if they get to you or your people. However, on (I believe) the 4th day, there's a standard minecraft-inspired blood moon type event. The only way I can rationalize this in my head is with the excuse that the programmer of the game somehow set the number of enemies to spawn as far too high but somehow didn't notice. The only way to survive is to do what feels like exploiting the game; I tried several different strategies before happening upon this one mere seconds before being overrun. I rushed the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything, played this (what I assumed was a) casual relaxing game like an RTS so that by the blood moon night, my pouch was literally overflowing with gold. I stood out in front of my town, between the advancing mass of jumpy red and green, and dumped all my money on the ground. This is the only thing I tried that actually got me through that night. I spent the next three days rebuilding and then the 4th night (8 total unless my count is off) another blood moon happened, and this time it brought flying jellyfish arm monsters which my defenses could do nothing against in addition to the phalanx of enemies blasting my way.","March 26","false","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Is it because I sped through it with a wiki or a walkthrough? No. It's because Kingdom has little to no content, and its gameplay provides almost no agency over what's happening. Imagine an online 'one side' defence games, the ones where you recruit units to go towards the enemy, who is on the other side of the screen, while raising your own defenses; only in Kingdom, you have only one type of combat unit (for the majority of the game), who is very ineffective in what he's doing, and you can't direct the unit at all. It's completely autonomous. Even units in Peter Molyneaux's games could've been interacted with more.\n\nIn Kingdom you play as a King or Queen, who have to rebuild their dominion from scratch. You do this by collecting and spending gold coins - pay a wild man a coin and he will join your camp. Pay at a tool stand and the peasant will pick up the hammer and become a builder. Throw money at a stone, it will be adapted to a tower for your archers, etc. etc.\n\nDuring the night you're being attacked by some monsters, who will steal your gold, knock it out of your people, knock their tools and weapons away, and then run with them. You prevent that by raising stockades and watchtowers and populating those with archers. Sounds easy and fun, right? Too bad it's tedious and plain boring after the first 15 minutes.\n\nFirst of all, the game only explains the most basic mechanics tou you, so how to throw gold at people and how to spend it at structures. The rest should be self-explanatory right? Well it isn't, and there are a lot of minor details to the game's mechanics that make it really frustrating, not only on the first, clueless playthrough.\n\nYou can't change the professions of your subjects, once they have picked up the tools (so at first either hammer or bow).\nYou can't decide which tool they will pick up - they tend to go for the one that's closer to them, or the one that was available earlier, so keep that in mind.\nYou will not learn from anywhere, but own trial and error, that upgrading your main camp will, at a certain level, upgrade the nearest stockades for free, saving you gold. You will learn the hard way that the upgraded farm makes the peasants stay at it for the night, even if the farm is outside the city's walls - meaning all of those guys will lose their tools and their gold, and will be changed to king-less folk, whom you need to bribe with gold again.\nYou will be furious to learn, that upgrading your camp to the maximum basically takes away your tribute chest. This chest appears every morning, yielding a lot of gold pieces. But after the camp being changed into a small castle, you get only one gold piece, but you need a lot of cash to fuel your kingdom. Hell, if I knew, I'd never upgrade!\n\nThose are just some of the pesky little things, that would be forgivable, if it wasn't for one thing. Kingdom doesn't have much more to offer. You run from left to right, managing the slowly growing Kingdom, learning across multiple playthroughs how to do it with maximum efficency, and soon enough you figure out that there's not much depth to all of it. There is no unit progression, the enemies grow up in strength at unfair rates, you play against the AI of your own subjects, because it tries to do the most stupid things.\n\nPlaying the Kingdom was fun at first and it certainly can suck you in for hours, but for 10 Euros it's not worth it and I can't recommend it, because it got boring and tedious in 4 hours.","March 26","false","7.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The idea is fantastic, and it's fun up to a point. After a while though, you just end up too frustrated with the mechanics of it. Every day having to run in one direction to recruit villagers becomes a chore, especially since you have to spend most of the time at an insanely annoying crawl; your gallop runs out fairly fast, leaving you slowly meandering away from the lightning fast enemies that are at least twice as fast as your horse. And you better hope you have camps to recruit from; the random placement of items in the world generation produces unwinnable worlds quite regularly. Money becomes a non-issue fairly quickly, with farms especially generating so much money that a walk through your farm will overflow and empty coinpurse. Walking past a group of archers throws up so many coins it'ss take you ten minutes to escape the lag.\n\nSpeaking of which, the lag. I have what I feel to be a respectable PC (GTX 970, FX 6350, 8gb RAM) yet the lag as soon as day 20ish onwards renders the game nigh unplayable. Every night lasts much longer than it should due to the immense lag that constantly occurs.\n\nAnd lastly, a pet annoyance. You lose if your crown falls off. Seriously. Your entire kingdom gives up and goes home if you don't have flashy enough headgear, despite having so much gold from those farms you could probably build your walls from it. My latest game ended on the cusp of victory, almost 50 days in and about to destroy the final portal, because some monsters were out at noon sitting right on the other end of the portal I jumped through. My legions of super-laggy archers just gave up apparently.\n\nOverall, the game has a fantastic concept, but the execution is just not up to par.","March 25","false","10.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What's not to like?\n\nWell, it's also obscure (at first) and boring. The two sessions I had I spent most of the time wandering aimlessly around, waiting to get coins to upgrade buildings and hiring new people. I got few enemies, but were able to fend them off. Then, on the next night, I got 7 goblins or whatever, and they completely raided my "kingdom". The game felt obscure, boring and unbalanced.\n\n* Riding around your kingdom seems like a great idea, and it works in the beginning. But soon enough the novelty wears off, and moving around in the world becomes an annoyance. It feels like the devs locked themselves game design wise by using slow moving protagonist.\n\n* Because you only tiny slice of the world at a time, it becomes a burden to keep track of things. If you want to go to check if coins were generated at some place, you need to move there, and it takes time. Even this is logically and realisticly understandable, as game design it just doesn't work. I didn't find anything fun in running around chasing coins.\n\n* The game doesn't explain anything to you. I respect that as a design point of view, but falls flat in two ways: first, it prevents you from properly learning how the game, and playing feels obscure. It was easier to quit the game than keep playing it, the game didn't give me enough hooks to go on. Secondly, it feels that the lack of explanation is used to cover up the lack of real content in the game.\n\nAnyway, there's potential.

I do not recommend this game on account of both bugs, and late game gameplay issues.\n\nThe concept is fun. This game is a small scale, 2d, city builder somewhat similar in vein to age of empires with obvious tweaks to the formula.\n\nThe game is played as follows: Run back and and forth collecting gold from your peasants (who are either archers, builders, farmers, or knights), selectively upgrading your town (town hall, walls, garrisons, water wheels, and late game portals), and running into the woods to buy more peasants.\n\nThe above can be surprisingly fun and rewarding, however there are some late game issues that really kill the game:\n\nWhen you hit around the half way point of the game, it takes your character literally a full day just to run back and forth to each end of your camp. It takes unarmed peasants even longer. This turns into a "logistics" problem where you constantly find yourself running from side to side to restock troops and balance building out further (which in turn makes you run further). This becomes not fun pretty fast, gold becomes a non issue at this point as well, as you constantly race against the clock to run insurmountable distances to repeat mundane tasks.\n\nIn terms of bugs: Sometimes end of game doesn't register. Sometimes archers will endlessly walk to their death instead of returning to town at night (this is somewhat game breaking early game).\n\nThe graphics are really great. The gameplay is novel. I can't endorse full price. I just can't.

It gets you going with a very simple premise, get money, recruit villagers, upgrade your town.  Buy hammers to turn villagers into builders, buy bows to turn them into hunters.  Then they introduce farmers, catapults, and lastly knights.  And this all takes place in the format of a side scroller.  It's really unique.\n\nAnd you get to build up your town, which is fun at first.  You unlock a new building every other day or so.  It's exciting when your towers and walls get higher and higher.\n\nThe challenge of the enemies which assault your town ramps up as well, with a massive wave every 5 days.  At first it's a ton of fun trying to build up enough to meet the challenge.\n\nBut very quickly you realize it's rather shallow.  In fact, it's repetitive and shallow.  After a certain point all you do anymore is build walls and towers, and try to replenish your archers from the scant recruits you need to venture deeper and deeper into the forest to find.  After day 10 there is only one more thing to see.  After day 20 there is nothing.\n\nAnd the challenge quickly escalates to something that feels unfair.  You need lots of archers to defend your walls.  But then the quantity and toughness of enemies increases, and you need catapults.  Then the floating demons show up which fly over your walls and just pluck people up and eat them.  But that's still manageable, if you have a large enough mass of archers behind your walls.  Then the trolls show up, and they destroy walls and throw your catapult rocks back at you, decimating your archers beyond recovery.  But they are slow, so you need to build towers a ways out to weaken them as they approach your town.  Except any archers you put in your towers just get eaten by the floating demons.  It's a game of rock, paper, scissors where at the end of the day, you aren't allowed to throw rock.\n\nBut to make matters even worse, the gameplay is rather passive as well.  When the action gets started, you mostly just get to watch.  Really you don't even need to be there.  Except there is nowhere else to be, since to leave the safety of your town results in disaster anyways.  So you sit and do nothing while your archers fend off the enemy, and you wait for the sun to come up.  Another aspect of this game which is novel at first, but gets old fast.\n\nWho knows, maybe they'll flesh this game out a bit more.  Right now it feels like a proof of concept from a gamejam without the depth or scope of content a full game requires.  For a game which has achievements going out to surviving 100 days, the amount of content is surprisingly sparse.\n\nIf they flesh out the content more I'd change my opinion.  The game needs a longer path of escalation.  Give the player more tools to mitigate the limits of the early game, but then throw bigger challenges at them which force them to rush further up a tech tree to mitigate those.  Add something to ward off the flying demons, but then add another enemy which counters that.  Upgrade the players horse to run farther and faster since you have to cover a lot more ground in the late game.  Give the player something to do at night except just watch the action.  These are the challenges the Kingdom dev team needs to overcome before I consider this anything more than a tech demo or a proof of concept.","March 25","false","24.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You're a king or queen founding a kingdom. You use coins to recruit people to your kingdom, build structures and defenses and train your people, and you get coins through hunting, farming, and chests you sometimes get. There are 4 portals, 2 on each side of your settlement, that spawn enemies at night that attack your camp, and your archers and walls must hold them off. The goal is to grow your kingdom and eventually destroy the portals.\n\nWhen I first got this, I played it for a while and couldn't stop throughout my whole first run. I lasted 20-something days, and even though I knew I should be going to bed, it kept me playing. It was a lot of fun! But eventually, I grew my kingdom too large too fast, I tried to destroy some portals too early and my kingdom was destroyed. OK, I thought. It's my first run. I'll do better next time.\n\nAnd I did. But that's where the game lost me. Because after the basics, the game doesn't get any more complex. You build some walls, train some archers, rince, repeat. You do some other stuff too, but it's all the same thing, really. And all that would be OK and I would play through the game a couple of times and be satisfied since it's so cheap, but you get into the issue of awful controls. Well, I can't say "awful." Let's just say, "nonexistent."\n\nYou can do 2, maybe 3 things with your character. Move left or right (and sprint/gallop) and drop coins. Where you drop the coins is how you build: place them at your campfire to upgrade your main building, the boyer to make more bows for archers, etc. But that's it. All your subjects act according to their own crappy AI. You can't direct your archers to one side or the other, so if there's a huge attack from one side and nothing on the other? Don't worry, your flank will be safe because you have a big group of archers watching that side while the other is overrun. Did you have a builder out chopping down trees or building something outside the wall? Half the time he'll just stand there until night and get attacked by monsters (losing his hammer that you had to pay to build, and then the coin you paid him to join you, causing him to wander off into the night, not your subject anymore). Did you build a watchtower at what was once the edge of your kingdom, only to expand, ;eaving the watchtower standing pointlessly in the middle of your kingdom? Well, you just lost an archer forever, because if they climb into a tower, they never come down, and you can't destroy the tower.\n\nThis lack of being able to micromanage things is completely riduclous and totally ruins an otherwise fun game. I don't understand the developer's motivation to not include some sort of move command for individual villagers. Even at times when the AI isn't shoddy, it's so easy to send a worker outside your kingdom for something and then have it take too long and have them caught out at night. But can you have them just come back to the safety of the walls early? Nope! Too bad. They'll stand and watch as they're attacked by monsters. The description says it's a "strategy/resource management" game, but there's so little you're able to do in terms of strategy I feel they should just leave that part out.\n\nI really wanted to like this, because it looks beautiful and the gameplay is fun, but the lack of any sort of control whatsoever over your people is completely unacceptable.","March 28","false","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What's not to like?\n\nWell, it's also obscure (at first) and boring. The two sessions I had I spent most of the time wandering aimlessly around, waiting to get coins to upgrade buildings and hiring new people. I got few enemies, but were able to fend them off. Then, on the next night, I got 7 goblins or whatever, and they completely raided my "kingdom". The game felt obscure, boring and unbalanced.\n\n* Riding around your kingdom seems like a great idea, and it works in the beginning. But soon enough the novelty wears off, and moving around in the world becomes an annoyance. It feels like the devs locked themselves game design wise by using slow moving protagonist.\n\n* Because you only tiny slice of the world at a time, it becomes a burden to keep track of things. If you want to go to check if coins were generated at some place, you need to move there, and it takes time. Even this is logically and realisticly understandable, as game design it just doesn't work. I didn't find anything fun in running around chasing coins.\n\n* The game doesn't explain anything to you. I respect that as a design point of view, but falls flat in two ways: first, it prevents you from properly learning how the game, and playing feels obscure. It was easier to quit the game than keep playing it, the game didn't give me enough hooks to go on. Secondly, it feels that the lack of explanation is used to cover up the lack of real content in the game.\n\nAnyway, there's potential. But in its current state it felt like a Flash game you'd expect to play for free.","March 24","false","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I do not recommend this game on account of both bugs, and late game gameplay issues.\n\nThe concept is fun. This game is a small scale, 2d, city builder somewhat similar in vein to age of empires with obvious tweaks to the formula.\n\nThe game is played as follows: Run back and and forth collecting gold from your peasants (who are either archers, builders, farmers, or knights), selectively upgrading your town (town hall, walls, garrisons, water wheels, and late game portals), and running into the woods to buy more peasants.\n\nThe above can be surprisingly fun and rewarding, however there are some late game issues that really kill the game:\n\nWhen you hit around the half way point of the game, it takes your character literally a full day just to run back and forth to each end of your camp. It takes unarmed peasants even longer. This turns into a "logistics" problem where you constantly find yourself running from side to side to restock troops and balance building out further (which in turn makes you run further). This becomes not fun pretty fast, gold becomes a non issue at this point as well, as you constantly race against the clock to run insurmountable distances to repeat mundane tasks.\n\nIn terms of bugs: Sometimes end of game doesn't register. Sometimes archers will endlessly walk to their death instead of returning to town at night (this is somewhat game breaking early game).\n\nThe graphics are really great. The gameplay is novel. I can't endorse full price. I just can't. Pick this up on sale so you don't get upset when the charm quickly wares away.","March 25","false","9.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/namrok/recommended/368230/","namrok","Namrok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/namrok/","424 products in account","This game starts off really strong, and shows a lot of promise.  It gets you going with a very simple premise, get money, recruit villagers, upgrade your town.  Buy hammers to turn villagers into builders, buy bows to turn them into hunters.  Then they introduce farmers, catapults, and lastly knights.  And this all takes place in the format of a side scroller.  It's really unique.\n\nAnd you get to build up your town, which is fun at first.  You unlock a new building every other day or so.  It's exciting when your towers and walls get higher and higher.\n\nThe challenge of the enemies which assault your town ramps up as well, with a massive wave every 5 days.  At first it's a ton of fun trying to build up enough to meet the challenge.\n\nBut very quickly you realize it's rather shallow.  In fact, it's repetitive and shallow.  After a certain point all you do anymore is build walls and towers, and try to replenish your archers from the scant recruits you need to venture deeper and deeper into the forest to find.  After day 10 there is only one more thing to see.  After day 20 there is nothing.\n\nAnd the challenge quickly escalates to something that feels unfair.  You need lots of archers to defend your walls.  But then the quantity and toughness of enemies increases, and you need catapults.  Then the floating demons show up which fly over your walls and just pluck people up and eat them.  But that's still manageable, if you have a large enough mass of archers behind your walls.  Then the trolls show up, and they destroy walls and throw your catapult rocks back at you, decimating your archers beyond recovery.  But they are slow, so you need to build towers a ways out to weaken them as they approach your town.  Except any archers you put in your towers just get eaten by the floating demons.  It's a game of rock, paper, scissors where at the end of the day, you aren't allowed to throw rock.\n\nBut to make matters even worse, the gameplay is rather passive as well.  When the action gets started, you mostly just get to watch.  Really you don't even need to be there.  Except there is nowhere else to be, since to leave the safety of your town results in disaster anyways.  So you sit and do nothing while your archers fend off the enemy, and you wait for the sun to come up.  Another aspect of this game which is novel at first, but gets old fast.\n\nWho knows, maybe they'll flesh this game out a bit more.  Right now it feels like a proof of concept from a gamejam without the depth or scope of content a full game requires.  For a game which has achievements going out to surviving 100 days, the amount of content is surprisingly sparse.\n\nIf they flesh out the content more I'd change my opinion.  The game needs a longer path of escalation.  Give the player more tools to mitigate the limits of the early game, but then throw bigger challenges at them which force them to rush further up a tech tree to mitigate those.  Add something to ward off the flying demons, but then add another enemy which counters that.  Upgrade the players horse to run farther and faster since you have to cover a lot more ground in the late game.  Give the player something to do at night except just watch the action.  These are the challenges the Kingdom dev team needs to overcome before I consider this anything more than a tech demo or a proof of concept.","March 25","false","24.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The structure follows that every ten days a very large wave of monsters will decend upon your town. The most difficult part of this is not so much said monsters but getting around the game's inherent flaws; The sluggish pace of which your workers move, the extremely short time frame for each day, and the lack of being able to defend yourself and instead relying solely upon your defenses. Such defenses require an ideal layout which is random each time on a new game, For example a rock is used to build the first part of a tower (which can then be further upgraded to house more archers), a wheat field that is used for a large source of income may be too far away, etc. This game has a lot of charm, especially if you like retro-style visuals. Bottomline I don't think this game was well thought out. It has a very steep learning curve, almost to the point where the defeat comes so easily one might think the developers were being preachy on the transience of any success.","February 23","false","7.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is some "random generation" of places to put towers and walls, but it doesn't seem to get in the way of major gameplay most of the time - begging the question as to why it's random in the first place. I suspect it's there for the same reason as the "super mysterious lack of rules" - to obfuscate the sheer simplicity of the mechanics. Because once you get the gist of it and realize the end goal, it switches from interesting discovery to tedium and being severely punished for small missteps (or in my case, building too fast because "waiting patiently for your minions to adjust for 10 minutes" is not my idea of fun). You will also get to experience the joy of riding an asthmatic horse who tires out after a light jog, a horse which you will use to cross ever increasingly large distances.\n\nI won't go into detail over the specifics, in case you'd like to do the whole "discovery" thing, but essentially the game goes expand -> introduce annoyances ->  expand -> more annoyances, severe catastrophe -> repeat until optimized.\n\nThe atmosphere, music and style are good - and it's fairly solid bugs-wise, which I have to give credit for given some of the rubbish currently on steam. I also know there are people who enjoy tedium and minutia, and will love this game. But this review is more for people who don't consider alphabatizing their rock collection a fun way to pass their time.\n\nIt passes in it's function as something to distract you for a while.

This wouldn't necessarily be a problem, as often you can intuit the function of something from the game. This is not the case for Kingdom. There are many buildings and upgrades that you only buy to try and guess - most of which are absolutely crucial to your success.\n\nSomewhat counter-intuitively, the game punishes expansion by removing your source of new peasants, and adding only one relatively late game option for traveling quickly across your vast kingdom, making the bulk of the game a "Manage the Horse's Stamina Simulator". This is offset by the massive amount of income that expansion can bring. Income that - after a point - becomes needlessly excessive (example: If the player chooses to expand vastly in one direction, the entire farmer class becomes unnecessary, due to the prevalence of rabbits, which net 1 gold each).\n\nTo top it off, the game is short. VERY short. And it offers little in the way of replay value.\n\nIn summary: I might pay $2 for this as a mobile game. Definitely not $10, and I feel like I got a bum deal at the $5 price point.","March 29","false","5.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Whether you are a boy or a girl is random though you can roll a new appearance on the loading screen by pressing the S key. You start off with nothing but a few coins and must set up shelter before the dark hits. A small tutorial is given, though pretty soon you will be left to figure things out on your own. This is a trial and error type of game so you will more than likely die your first few times playing. Other than riding around and sprinting on your horse, your only other form of interactivity will be to drop money on people or objects. You have no forms of attack and must rely on your peasants to get you through the night. To recruit more peasants you go searching the wilderness for them and give them a coin to convince them. Why they need to be bribed when you are offering food and shelter from the darkness we may never know.\n\nGiving coins to the stall with a hammer will get you a hammer that a peasant with no profession can pick up to start building walls and maintaining your defenses. The stall with a bow will allow you to buy the equipment necessary for Archers, which will be your main source of income early on as they will hunt the lands and return to you with the profits of poaching animals. Archers are also your only unit capable of attacking for a large portion of the game and are absolutely necessary to surviving the creature filled night. You will need to build a wall so that they stand a chance at winning since your melee units are only recruitable late in game, annoyingly enough. Guard towers will usually be able to be built behind walls and station an archer high above ground to defend your kingdom. That may seem useful but in reality towers are a waste of money in this game due to the Archers never again be able to leave from it. It does not sound that bad, but when you start expanding and you have a bunch of archers stationed in useless positions, while your forces are weak from the previous attack and on the verge of collapsing, it can very easily lead to your doom.\n\nYour doom can still come easily in various cheap feeling ways. Archers have terrible aim and when you have a horde of relentless creatures tearing down your wall, which can easily result in them getting through and wiping out your kingdom due to not being allowed to have melee units yet. So build more walls or upgrade them further you may think. Well what you do in this game doesn't really feel like building, everything is preset for you in certain locations, so you have no say to where or what you build. You can upgrade your walls twice which is not all that durable and to upgrade your wall further you have to go deep into a random part of the forest and offer coins to some kind of shrine. It is fine to have little hand holding but that makes no sense. Tearing down buildings is not possible so be very careful about what you build. Buildings cannot be moved either, so new peasants that arrive when you have a quite a bit of territory will have to go all the way to the center of your kingdom to get a bow or hammer. That is a walk all the way from where you recruit them, down to the center of your kingdom and back to the outskirts of your territory where you actually need them.\n\nEven then your peasants love to wander off and occasionally die a needless death when they are out after dark. It makes sense that your archers may lose track of time when hunting but when they see it is dark out they will very slowly make their way back without a care in the world. The dumb friendly AI and their slow movement speed combine perfectly together to make things far more tedious than they should be. Builders seem to have the worst AI as they will often times be off staring into space somewhere instead of being on the front lines doing their jobs and manning the catapults which only they know how to use. Sadly you are also affected by slow movement speeds and an asthmatic horse than can only run for a few seconds. In a game with no means of controlling anything other than going right up to the object you want to interact with, even if it is on the other side of the map, having a feature that hinders your means to do so is utterly unnecessary. Your horse can sprint a bit longer if you stand still and let it eat some grass though not by much.\n\nEach day you receive taxes from your peasants and these are placed in the center of your kingdom. So imagine you have just withstood a huge attack and most of your peasants didn't make it. That means you have to go to the center of town if you need cash and then all the way to forests, while hoping that your very slow peasants make it before dark. Even if they do they certainly won't make it all the way to the center of the kingdom and back to the front lines to fight. You cannot tell them what profession to be either, they will grab a tool at random and you will not be able to change him into something else. There is no way of telling how many of your peasants don't have a profession and are currently useless unless you stumble upon them. The amount that they ask you to do in such a short day is absurd and quickly starts to feel like a chore. You feel like less of a king and more like an obsessive mother, trying to bribe her rebellious kids into doing what she wants, one that has never heard of a safe and decided to throw into a lake whatever extra money she may have that won't fit in her purse. At the very least they nailed the environments and atmosphere of the game. The mood of this game ranges from creepy to yet another perfect sunny day to good effect. Whatever the case may be the soundtrack definitely adds a lot to the experience.\n\nThe starting monsters in this game are greedy little creatures that will steal anything they can get their hands on and over all else want the shiny crown on your head which will result in a game over for you. They are easy to defeat most nights, however when the moon turns red they will attack in a massive horde that will likely be the death of you. Well actually these creatures will not kill you or anyone else but they will steal all your peasant's equipment and cause them to flee from your kingdom until you bribe them to stay. The other two monsters that appear later on will gladly kill all of you however.  Which your blind Archers and lazy Builders seem all too eager to let happen. I don't mean to make Kingdom sound like an awful game, it's just extremely tedious due to poor design. It could have been an amazing game but every positive thing seems to have more negative to it. Sure the world is randomly generated but with buildings being preset for you it all feels the same with no room for experimentation. You are free to explore the cool environments but must micromanage far too many things in person and night is upon you before you know it. Yes you are the king, though it feels more like being the paper boy with no say over anything, that just so happens to have everyone's paycheck in his pouch. With better AI, a real time map of sorts that shows you how many peasants you have as well as their profession, longer days and maybe some sort of NPC that recruits peasants for twice the prize, Kingdom would become a much better game. As it is, I would suggest holding off on buying it and seeing if any improvements are made, if you are interested in what Kingdom offers.","November 10, 2015","false","4.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","2"

Only that it really isn't that.\n\nThere were many things that I disliked on my first 3 attempts but i would just like to highlight one to make my point:\n\nYou usually start the game by hiring a few hunters and they make decent cash for the first few days. At around day 8 you will suddenly run out of money and wonder why - there are literally no animals left in the proximity of your camp. In my first attempt this really struck me as odd because I had to wait through the night to get a little bit of gold from the chest just to replenish my troops and of course lost the game soon afterwards. There is a solution to this, you have to go out to the forest and try to chase the deer in the direction of your camp which is the most frustrating thing ever. Those dang things will outrun your horse all the time and never go in the direction you want, but you have to do this nearly every day until you can do some farming.\n\nI don't get how things like this fit into the game concept.\n\nThis could have been a great game but I certainly can't recommend it. If this was an iOS game for 2.99 I would have played it for 2 hours and stamped it as a decent experience, just because of the artwork and sound design but for $10 I was hoping for more.","October 21, 2015","false","24.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","1"

Also, this is the first time I have reviewed anything so if I seem too vague in my opinions let me know.\n\nTL;DR - This game has SOOO much potential as it has a very unique approach to this genre. The art and music are amazing and create an interesting and enjoyable atmosphere. The early game is quite entertaining as well. However, the lack of content, depth, control and terrible AI results in a tedious and boring experience.\nPROS:\n- The soundtrack was nice. It built the atmosphere and mood of the environment and situations (battling/night and day/peacefuk).\n- Art is pretty spectacular :) I am such a huge fan of pixel graphics and this game delivered tremendously. Everything had a beautiful design, the environment was created perfectly (rain, fog, night, day) and it all felt amazing.\n- The beginning of the game is quite exciting. When you start off gathering workers and initially building the village it's great because everything is so close and you are getting use to the game.\nCONS:\n- To me this game lacks a lot of content. As said before, the beginning is actually very fun because I wasn't aware of the rest of the game. But as I progressed I realised that there wasn't much more to do. The game mainly consists of building and upgrading (which is very simple in its self), managing gold and workers and exploring (with little to find). Maybe if there was upgrade trees to buildings, different classes for warriors, upgrading yourself (the king/queen) so you can fight or move around faster (god damn you move slow).\n- Terrible AI. The Ai is very bad in this game. The archers have heaps of trouble hitting things, the knights do absolutely nothing, sometimes the workers walk off into the wild. It really is frustrating.\n- Lack of control over game. You can't control where troops are to defend, what occupation your new troops will take on. You can't choose where to build as there are build points throughout the landscape, this coupled with the procedurally generated terrain makes for some very limited and random defensive oppourtunities.\n- Everything moves WAY to slow. Workers walk too slow and often get converted back while walking, expecially if they are too far away. Buildings that are on the outskirts can take ages to be built only to be knocked down again at night or not get built in time. The horse needs to move a little faster (or there needs to be teleportation things you unlock) as it takes ages to get to the sides of your kingdom once you progress. Also when your workers get their tools taken away it takes ages for them to get it back because they have to walk all the way to the shop again.\n- No HUDs. There could be little indicators to tell you if you are getting attacked, how many archers, warriors or people you have. Also an overview of the map would be useful as you can see where buildings need to be upgraded or where you are getting attacked. You are very much not notified of anything in this game, which I think i quite unfair and punishing to the player.\n- Not very resource-gathery. There is only really 2 resources you gather in this game, gold and people. I wish there could be more resources to gather and manage which would in itself open up more content for the game.\n\nI know this game says it has a 'minimalist feel' but I just feel that it is WAY to lacking in content. Either add more content and replayability or lower the price tag. For me, the positives are heavily outweighed by the negatives. Sorry, but I can't recommend this game.","December 30, 2015","false","1.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Kingdom does not hold you by the hand, it throws you in, after showing you how to build your basic shelter, and then you are left on your own.\nWhen the night starts, that's when the badies start to come at you, and they will relentlessly try to take you down so far I'm trying to sruvive the attacks, so can't really tell you what may unfold later in the game.\nMusic is a worthy addition to the game, it changes according to your actions, and the situation to the world, in an non intrussive but noticable way.\nMechanics so far are simplistic, you get coins, and you pay coins to\n1. Get a person to follow you\n2. Buy him equipment\n3. Build defenses and upgrade you'r land\n4. In my last game I stumbled across a merchant.\nat least that's what I figured out so far. There are some places in the game where you can use your coins but I wasn't able to figure out what they do so far.\n\nI had not been able to fully experience this game yet, but I will try to add to this review\n\nSome early let's play videos: https://youtu.be/Hw_QBBWefGM","October 21, 2015","true","5.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

You can only build a farm (which you cannot demolish, and at your frontlines) and send them in afterwards.\n\nIf you want to improve things: I think more types of enemies, traps, and other content would make the game more enjoyable for a longer time. Enable the player to make more strategic descisions instead of making the player grind to win the game, like you are now.

As the player is so relient on AI villagers it's insanely frustrating not to be able to control them, especially as they're so vulnerable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ProfessorBill/recommended/368230/","ProfessorBill","Professor Bill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ProfessorBill/","172 products in account","As others are saying, the units and the vast size of the game are the most frustrating aspects of the game.\n\nTo briefly elaborate, you have a center base and need to recruit by venturing out of your center base to get them from fire-and-tent camps.  You normally only get 2 recruits at a time.  These recruits then walk back to center base.  However, as you build farther and farther out, your recruits take longer and longer to get to the center.  If they lose their weapon by being attacked -- or even worse, demoralized, where you have to hire them again or lose them forever -- then they have to walk alllll the way back to the center from battlefront. It's insanely time consuming.\n\nAnd speaking of having to hire them again if they become demoralized, you have to be there to hire them.  But if they lose their weapons, you have to buy new ones (at the very center of the map).  So with a two-front war, you have to just pick a side to be present on and support, all the while trying to run back and be sure your recruits have the weapons they need so they can get right back to the front.  Meanwhile, if one side gets devastated, you have to spend another day recruiting, running back and forth to the center to equip your new recruits.  *Even if* you buy a bunch of equipment in advance, the too-simple AI just grabs the nearest item.\n\n"Do you need archers, but bought 4 hammers?  Too bad, you now have 4 builders!  Guess you gotta recruit more guys!"\n\nYou can't flag or assign new recruits to special roles, or give them gold to go back to the center camp to buy what you tell them to buy.  You need to be there to buy the equipment.\n\nMeanwhile your kingdom gets destroyed.\n\nCome to think of it, you need to be present to do EVERYTHING in this game.  There's long-distance task assignments.\n\nAnd did I mention how *long* it takes to run from one side to another?   After your settlement gets even halfway to the portals (which you need to destroy to stop enemies from spawning), you're going to spend a solid half your time in travel, hoping you reach the other side to rebuild defenses.\n\nAnd finally, speaking of defenses?  You don't get to choose where they are and they aren't predictable, nor sensible.  You should have an archer tower next to the high wall, but for some reason they frequently don't spawn near each other.   So while your tall stone wall is being dismantled bit by bit, you sit helplessly watching your archers shoot in high arcs over the wall (missing at least half of the shots), or just plain shooting at the wall itself.  It's bonkers.\n\nThis game has potential and it's a lot of fun for the first 30 minutes, partially (I think) because it's so simplistic, which I think is the reason for all the positive reviews.  Unfortunately its simplicity is its ultimate fault.\n\nTo the devs:  This game would be much better if you could just assign roles to your units and give them an area of operation so they know where to stand and defend, or where to re-buy equipment.  To that point, also include forward operating bases where units can re-buy equipment.  A fast travel between these points would be wonderful, as well as the ability to place structures relatively freely (such as the forward operating base, towers, walls, farms, etc.)\n\nAlso, depending on whether or not the above features are implemented, double the amount of camps that spawn, and double the recruits you can get once you reach day 30 or so, maybe even sooner.\n\nUntil then, this game is just a tease that leaves you frustrated there's nothing more behind it than what you see in the first 15-20 minutes.","December 29, 2015","false","3.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

No. You have archers and you have catapults. Both crawl along the ground and are easily neutralized by the weakest of monsters. Seriously, one hit and done. The invaders can't miss, there is only one path for them, and everything else to take.\n\nYou can build a tower, and an archer may climb it. But invading monsters can, and will, just knock him out of it. Again, in one hit.\n\nYou can't route the monsters with buildings and walls, and you can only build walls. On predetermined spots.\n\nSo, you build during the day. You run and hire peasants, who limp slowly back to your town and pick up the first item they trip over. A hammer, a bow, or a sythe. Only one of these is a weapon.\n\nWhich brings me up to my next complaint, zero instructions.  That can work if you feel a sense of reward for figuring things out. In this game, it just makes me angry. So I'm going to spoil it for you:\nHammers make workers. They build, repair, and operate the catapult.\nBows make archers. They kill incoming monsters during the night, and hunt during the day.\nSythes make farmers. They farm.\n\nI just saved the world tens of thousands of hours in wasted gameplay.\n\nAt night, your people retreat behind your fortifications and wait it out. Sometimes the monsters spawn.\n\nNow, here is the most frustrating part of the game. Mobs don't come at you in waves, like EVERY OTHER TOWER DEFENSE GAME OUT THERE. They all come at once. One crazy huge group. In the beginning it's just a handful. But after that? Expect 40 armored leaping mobs that plow through your sturdiest of walls in 3 seconds. Your 2 defending archers take about 4 seconds to reload. And they miss. A lot.\n\nYep, Your ONLY DEFENSE can't actually hit what it's aiming at. Probably because these death-turds come flying at them at mach speed. All of them can do that by the way.\n\nNow add in flyers that grab the archer off of your tower stand, and you're completely screwed.\n\nThis isn't a game. This is a sonnet, written in code, titled "We hate you. And if you want to hear the music, you'll have to pay extra."\n","March 16","false","3.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

There's very little for the player to do in terms of differentiating one play session from another: you build what the map gives you. The only major strategy is the timing on "when" you build certain things, and it's such a small amount of agency given to the player that is feels very minimal in terms of satisfaction. Once you get over the endearing graphics and inspired music, it unfortunately becomes exceptionally tedious having to canter from one side of your kingdom to another on a insanely easily winded horse while you pray your AI minions pick up the right items from your shops and do things in the order that is helpful.\n\nAt first I was seriously hoping it was going to be evocative of the original 1993 game Stronghold by TSR, but alas I felt extremely underwhelmed by this.

Kingdom really left me wanting more, in a bad way. I kept hoping there would be more to it, but all there is in the later game is the challenge of a paper thin tech tree, nonsensical AI, arbitrary and plainly unfun design decisions, and monster waves that never cease in getting more and more difficult.\n\nSurvived for 100 days? Sucks to be you, it's impossible to destroy the portals now. You can only summon two knights to a side, the extra knights on the cleared side of a map can't be moved, and even though you have 200 archers roaming around, only a few will wander near the side under attack at any one time. To attack a portal you can only send two knights plus six archers, and they move SLOWLY. Why can't you send your entire 200 man force at the portals and just finish the game? I have no idea.\n\nLater in the game, your minions will have their pockets overflowing with gold, and will heap it at your feet as you ride by. So if five or ten of them are wandering around the archery & farming booths, why can't you have them buy more equipment for you? Why isn't there a standing order to always keep four bows at the ready? I have no clue! You have to gallop your butt all the way back from the front, have your minions throw money at you, and then buy equipment literally a foot away from them.\n\nPerhaps the devs slimmed down the interface & gameplay to preserve the aesthtic they were going for? I can ALMOST get that...but not this way, guys. The game is just frustrating.","December 18, 2015","false","17.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

After playing this game for a good 5 hours more... I decided that there may need to seriously be some changes. However, these changes may kind of change the base gameplay and will probably never be impletemented. I love this game. Very fun. Unique. BUT... There is literally no customization, you can't even choose your banner. It would be nice to have some difficulty settings and even shoot at the enemy (even if it's the clumsy shooting that the archers do) just to at least have SOME CONTROL over your kingdom. After restarting the game so many times (can't even get to a save point) it almost feels like you really don't want to start from scratch after going through all of that OVER and OVER and OVER again.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: I am very impressed with simplicity of this game... but... IT'S ACTUALLY FUN. I love how the game has it's creepy moments with good music and freaky creatures.

My reckless expansion also pushed out the only camps between my kingdom and the demon-portals, starving me of recruits.\n\nMy second playthrough I knew better. Careful expansion outwards, fortifying my borders, constantly recruiting new archers to build my garrison. The blood moons would come, sometimes the enemy would overwhelm my defences, but I always tried to have a healthy stash of coins to rebuild.\n\nBefore long I had a farm within my borders, allowing my farmers to stay the night and work throughout the day. I had catapults to deal with hoards, maxed out walls, a large standing force of archers. And then a blood moon came again. This one with flying creatures, ogre-like siege monsters, and a hoard unlike any I had seen. Several maxed stone walls, multiple towers with 3 archers in them! And yet every thing was destroyed. Farmers, builders, archers, and all the peasants themselves lost to me. Probably 100 and change of coins lost in one night.\nAnd here's my problem with the game.\n\nYour daily allowance, a "tax" as it were, goes down as your castle levels up. I suppose it's under the assumption that you have a better economy, but what happens when that economy is destroyed? You find yourself with no farmers, no builders, almost no archers. You're spending coin just to gain more workers, but the archers can't hunt because they need to garrison those towers you built with your massive economy. Farmers, as expensive as they are, can't be left undefended. And spending money on builders just to spend money repairing walls that will crumble without archers to defend them...... and I got one lone coin each day? Enough to build some wooden stakes, not even a pallisade.\n\nI like a game with challenge, I like a game that makes you struggle. XCOM's Long War, Darkest Dungeon, games that throw the odds against you.\nThat last blood moon? There's no odds against you. That's not designed to be recoverable. Once that happens your game is done. Start over. Back to your tents, your wooden walls, your hunter-economy. Maybe this time you'll have a chance.\n\nIt's a great game, and I thoroughly enjoy it, enought to recommend it despite this. I'm hoping to see more content, updates, a more in-depth economy.\n\nBut can we get a means to continue the game after a killer siege? Something besides going back to the begining?","October 25, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Game was lagging due to the amount of coins on the screen but hey, not the point xD\n\nMy advise is this: only build one way first (AFTER getting a large force first. NEVER expand before day 5), always rush stone working ASAP, make sure to have an upgraded farmhouse as close as you can get to your farthest out wall, annnnnd never stop getting those hobos to join. If you go West first, you can get 4-6 of them in a day easily. Slap some bows on those guys and bam, plenty of arrows to murder demons with.\n\nQuestions about it?

You can find random little goodies out in the woods like shrines to boost your peoples and some weird temple that allows you to advance to the next tech level. Again these goodies could be ANYWHERE and if you never find that tech temple it'll be game over real quick.\n\nNow to the reason I have to select NO for this game; this game wasn't developed properly. They made their game half-Civ and half-tower defense with no tower defense gameplay at all. Your soldiers randomly decide what they are doing and where they are defending and you're just going to have to deal with it. I've had archers out beyond the wall during Red Moon nights (Boss time), builders charging through hordes to chop down a tree I scheduled two days earlier to be chopped, and don't even get me started on the catapults. The monsters generally only attack one side at a time, but you can't tell your soldiers where to go so you'll have one side with six soldiers falling asleep while the other has a horde barreling through. Your defenses are useless from behind so all you do is watch your kingdom fall.\n\nQuickly about catapults. They destroy massive hordes of enemies at once, but only if a builder is loading it. They also ALWAYS go to the furthest wall, nevermind that perfect choak-point you've got that's just asking for some heavy weapons. Catapults would be more functional if you could assign a builder to it permanently but too bad for you!!!\n\nNow for the part of the review that should be everyone's favorite GENDER POLITICS!!!! So you have no say on who your avatar could be; could be a black Queen in purple, blonde King in green, or any other combination. This is garbage liberal crap that has no place in video games just for the sole reason that, in our reality, people can self identify to be whatever the Hell they want. They can undergo surgery to become a man or choose to use the womans bathrooom for no other reason besides the fact that they feel like nothing should limit them. Why can't I choose my avatar?? This is honestly a missed opportunity to customize your banner, horse, colors, crown, whatever you want but NOPE all that's predetermined. Even though everything is supposed to be random I've been the same damn Queen with brown hair and a green dress 4 times, and when I've played about 7 rounds of this game you start to feel like it's not so random.\n\nSo you are so forward thinking when to comes to forced player characters, but why are the lowly, dirty, peasents men?? You're going to force me to play as a woman because you think I should but you aren't even going to include women in the working class of the Kingdom?? Is it because you're lazy and couldn't be bothered to animate another model (honestly the serfs are the same model with different hair and skin colors)?? Or is it because you think women are our betters and should be commanding men?? I just don't understand how you can force genders on your players but not include a mixup of npcs, it's lazy and if the shoe was on the other foot the developers would be ripped to pieces for their intolerance.\n\nI'm probably going to try this game two more times and be done with it. For $10 I'd say I got my money's worth out of this, but if the development team got their heads out of their asses and put as much work into combat as they did with cultivation then I would have picked the Yes button. Between having no authority over your subjects (huh kinda funny for a game called Kingdom) and their garbage gender politics of a 5 year old imma recommend you take your time elsewhere.\n","October 23, 2015","false","20.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

My reckless expansion also pushed out the only camps between my kingdom and the demon-portals, starving me of recruits.\n\nMy second playthrough I knew better. Careful expansion outwards, fortifying my borders, constantly recruiting new archers to build my garrison. The blood moons would come, sometimes the enemy would overwhelm my defences, but I always tried to have a healthy stash of coins to rebuild.\n\nBefore long I had a farm within my borders, allowing my farmers to stay the night and work throughout the day. I had catapults to deal with hoards, maxed out walls, a large standing force of archers. And then a blood moon came again. This one with flying creatures, ogre-like siege monsters, and a hoard unlike any I had seen. Several maxed stone walls, multiple towers with 3 archers in them! And yet every thing was destroyed. Farmers, builders, archers, and all the peasants themselves lost to me. Probably 100 and change of coins lost in one night.\nAnd here's my problem with the game.\n\nYour daily allowance, a "tax" as it were, goes down as your castle levels up. I suppose it's under the assumption that you have a better economy, but what happens when that economy is destroyed? You find yourself with no farmers, no builders, almost no archers. You're spending coin just to gain more workers, but the archers can't hunt because they need to garrison those towers you built with your massive economy. Farmers, as expensive as they are, can't be left undefended. And spending money on builders just to spend money repairing walls that will crumble without archers to defend them...... and I got one lone coin each day? Enough to build some wooden stakes, not even a pallisade.\n\nI like a game with challenge, I like a game that makes you struggle. XCOM's Long War, Darkest Dungeon, games that throw the odds against you.\nThat last blood moon? There's no odds against you. That's not designed to be recoverable. Once that happens your game is done. Start over. Back to your tents, your wooden walls, your hunter-economy. Maybe this time you'll have a chance.\n\nIt's a great game, and I thoroughly enjoy it, enought to recommend it despite this. I'm hoping to see more content, updates, a more in-depth economy.\n\nBut can we get a means to continue the game after a killer siege? Something besides going back to the begining?","October 25, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Game was lagging due to the amount of coins on the screen but hey, not the point xD\n\nMy advise is this: only build one way first (AFTER getting a large force first. NEVER expand before day 5), always rush stone working ASAP, make sure to have an upgraded farmhouse as close as you can get to your farthest out wall, annnnnd never stop getting those hobos to join. If you go West first, you can get 4-6 of them in a day easily. Slap some bows on those guys and bam, plenty of arrows to murder demons with.\n\nQuestions about it?

I'd recommend it, when it's on sale.\n\nI don't hate the game, in fact I like it in some ways, but it makes me want to stop playing when a blood moon comes on day 15 and decimates my whole camp. It gives me no drive to continue, as I feel like I'm just doing the same thing over and over again with nothing new. It's boring after a while, and whenever you get close to thinking you found something new, you get destroyed.","January 19","false","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The graphics are amazing and eerie in some areas. If you love charming, pixel games, then this is definitely a game for you. I haven't played for long and I've already fallen for this game. It's a castle sim but you're much more involved in the game. The graphics of the water is amazing, it makes the game feel realistic while feeling distinctively 8-bit. I can't express how much I love the hybrid combination of realism and pixels.\n\nSo far I've found no problems, but I have an improvement: when standing near an area where you can interact, please show what you will build, I had to experiment way too much with what I was building and I died multiple times because what I purchased was not something I needed.\n\nAll in all, a great game with lots of potential. I hope to see more added to the game; a level editor would be fun. Great work, developers. This has quickly become one of my favourite games.","December 27, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

If you like the following, you will most likely enjoy playing Kingdom. (This is my first review of a game on Steam, so sorry if this is not too helpful, I will try to be as descriptive as I can).\n\nIf you like/appreciate pixel art, you might like this game.\nIf you like tower defense games, you will most likely enjoy this game. (Side Note: Watching your defenses fight back is enjoyable).\nIf you like survival games, gathering resources, and each wave slightly increasing in difficulty, you will most likely enjoy this game.\nThis game does require you to micromanage carefully.\nGame allows you freedom in what you choose to either "build/expand/defend" next. Basically this game reacts accordingly based on your actions.\nEven if you lose the game, don't think of it as a bad thing but rather the game's way of trying to tell you what happen and what you might be able to do to prepare yourself the next time around. (Side Note: Game has great replay value!)\nAmbience:\nNow im going to try to describe the surrealism this game provides (honestly this is probably my most favorite quality of the game):\n\nKingdom is very relaxing to play, it does this so strangely because you know your preparing for an attack but the ambiance/theme of the entire game is just so well done. Day times make you feel like your on a warm field and feeling the bliss of the sun and its welcoming embrace. Even during the day, if you venture deep into the forest you can see the sun trying to peak through the tree tops and shine into the dark ominous forest. Night times really make you feel a sense of danger is approaching, your hear the subtly of the day's end leaving, no more sounds, it all turns quiet....then the danger is here, you know you must survive the night, you know the morning is just around the corner. From the sky, clouds, rain, sun, and moon this game does an amazing job with the ambience energy. The soundtrack/music of this game does an outstanding job with the day & night cycle and only adds more to the surreal factor. Overall the day & night cycle is very well implemented within the game. I love how during the dawn and dusk cycles you are able to feel/see them arrive and leave.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nOverall, Kingdom is an enjoyable, casual, easy to pick up and play game. The game doesn't over clutter you with extensive menus/UI, your only controls are just the "WASD" keys and the Escape key for your pause menu. I think my most favorite quality of Kingdom, (at least in my opinion) is the surrealism of the forest and fields with the nice little grassy plains with the ominous sounds of the night. The steam achievements are also a very nice addition to the game because they provide you with some great challenges that keep you coming back to play the game. This game has great replay value with each play-through the map being procedurally generated. My only con is just I wish you can cancel or destroy an unwanted building, but who knows maybe thats part of the challenge of the game. Overall, I am glad I bought this game, and would recommend it to anyone who loves tower defense games and enjoys pixelated art/graphics. I do not regret any part of it and fully enjoy the game. Definite time killer for sure!\n\n\n\n-SPOILER BELOW-\nWhile Kingdom does not have a story, I say spoiler because I am going to describe what it is that your actually doing in this game. If you want to discover these things for yourself in the game then don't read anything beyond this.\n\nYour ultimate goal is to protect your crown for either the King or Queen you play as, if the enemies take this crown from you, its game over. On the left and right sides of the map, you will find 2 portals where the enemies are actually coming from, so a total of 4 portals. So your goal is to destroy these portals and push back the enemy while getting 1 step closer to your Kingdom's safety. You will have to try to time your assaults on these portals just right during the day and night cycles to get the edge on them. Just know that the longer you wait to destroy them, the harder they are to actually get to because they will spawn more enemies. This is good because it keeps the game more challenging. So basically the sooner you can destroy them, the better. So when you destroy a portal, its not over yet! A massive assault of enemies will spawn from the remains of the portal's wreckage where you will have to make sure your town is ready to defend itself. So when you destroy all 4 portals, you win the game.","January 7","true","36.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You build up your base and recruit more and more citizens while expanding. And all of that in a 2D sidescrolling where you yourself can´t interact with the enemies or your troops.\n\nStarting the game feels great. Seeing the first coins slip into your purse is very satisfying to look at, building your first buildings gives you a sense of accomplishment and surviving your first red moon really keeps you going.\nThe game looks and feels great but sadly it can´t hold that for long.\n\nIt took me about 30 minutes until i saw everything there is to see. There are 4 buildings and 3 units. That´s it.\nSure it´s fun at the start, but building walls and towers can´t keep you going for long. And it´s nearly all you can build. Same with your units. Sure, recruiting your first archers is nice, but when it´s nearly the only thing you can recruit for the entire game, there is no sense of progress.\nThe game runs it´s content down way too quickly so after about 5-8 nights (ingame), you´ll have seen it all.\nI know that the game keeps expanding as you can go to more than 90 nights, but why would you bother if there is nothing new coming your way?\n\nI got tired really quickly by this and just can´t reccommend it to anyone...","March 24","false","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

EXCELLENT\n\nIt has great Pixelated Art, the gameplay is VERY simple, yet the game is so unique, it just berly gives you a tutorial, (trust me you almost dont need it).\nYou starts out as a Queen in the middle of a forest, who has come to build her own kingdom. I am pretty positive every 5 nights the Blood Moon(BM) will arrive, and you must have your village prepared to be attacked by many sorts of monsters, every new BM will have more and more monsters. It makes for a really interesting gameplay, because not only do you have a bunch of monsters that continue to build up every BM they only attack one side. Sound Easy right? Sometimes its not so easy, one side will be nice and ready and next thing you know your being attacked on the opposite side and almost loose your crown.\nIt seems easy peasy at first until you realise, your bag can only hold so many gold coins, and you only have so much time to build(should only be building during the day, nightimes pretty risky), and you're constantly in a cat n mouse chase with those gold coins, you can never have enough, or you have way too much and cannot spend anything..\nYou almost never want to pause to take a break because there is ALWAYS something in need of support, or you're in need of more villagers.\n\nThis game is certainly unique in its own way, I couldn't be happier with it. Very basic, but very strategic when it comes to building and managing both sides of the village.

Then something dramatic happens, or you run out of archers/people to employ. Keeps the game interesting, and you really need to think about where your resources are going.\nAddictive. You will want to play this one until you beat it (no matter how repetitive).\nCons - :\n\nPersonally found the game too short. I just wish there was more is all ):. Only had to restart 2-3 times before I got the hang of things, and then completed the game under 20 hours.\nInstructions may be confusing for some people. As there practically is none. But I guess thats what you get for a trial and error game.\nConclusion\nFun game for the price.

It is a very detailed game in terms of graphics, but in terms of gameplay, I think there were decisions the developers made, that should not have been made.

Every blood moon that occurs, by entire kingdom is destroyed. I'm just lucky to have enough money to build it back up.\n-Time cycles\nThe days pass by to quickly. I barely have enough time to prepare before the night comes and I'm attacked.\n-Speed\nThe AI's speed is extremely slow. In the morning I had a builder fix a wooden wall. He started coming back in the evening.\n-Stone\nWhile I was writing this review I learned that you apparently need to throw a ton of money at an altar to get stone tier defenses. I've never even seen that altar before which means its very hard to find.\n\nSo while this is a great game, I think they made some decisions that take away from the game.

On the one side its a very charming game with a really good set up to it. Its very minimal and yet requires a lot of thought. On the other hand its such an unforgiving game. I find there is really only one way to even play this game and to me thats somewhat of a problem. You can scour the internet yourself but the bottom line is if you dont have a many MANY archers on either side of your base you will lose. It is also extraodinarily hard to come back from, especially late game when you cannot count on your town chest for gold.\n\nPros\n-Can be quite relaxing, your just sitting around or riding your horse back and forth no cares in the world.\n-Easier to understand than others would let on. This game has a very quick tutorial that does not cover quite a few things such as farming or later game military units. However I find that just adds to it. Its all about figuring stuff out. People dont seem to want to do that anymore\n-graphics seem pretty basic however some are just amazing. The water is my favorite\n-For both casual and the hardcore. You can easily lose hours to this game OR hop in for a quick day or two which is only about 15 minutes.\n\nCons\n-Very VERY unforgiving. If one side falls your base falls. Even if you manage to fight the wave back it is impossible to recover due to you having to spend a ton of gold just to get your villagers to come back to your side, not to mention the cost of re equiping AND wall repairs.\n-A good run requires a very strong start. You pretty much need a farm stream close by, good hunting grounds on either if not both sides AND village hovels that are not to to far apart. Can be frustrating trying to get all those things in one map. And then one small mistake or miscalculation with your defences and you just sit to and watch it burn down.\n-AI is a real hassle at times. Archers some times wander to far out and cannot make it back in time before they get murdered by the haunts at night. Or farmers insiting on staying out. I would love to see a system put into effect such as a recall bell or something like that so you can manually call the troops and villagers into town.\n\nI recommend this game solely because it's charming and a great play. It has its faults like many others (My big problem being why do you get less money the bigger your Kingdom gets when really you should be receiving more), and AI can give you a headache. It is unforgiving but that also leads you to learn things and become a better King/Queen for your next play through.","December 27, 2015","true","10.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Despite some other reviews to the contrary though, it is also game full of strategy and subtlety.  The challenge lies in the fact that you do not have full control over your subjects or the landscape.  You must make your choices as they have lasting effects:  create too many builders too early and you might run out of money; too many archers and you won't be able to fortify your defenses.  Build your walls too close and have no room to farm;  build them too far out and get overrun.  And what if you don't have the quarry to build your watch tower where you need it?  Do you hire extra archers or do you just push your borders?  It's different, and a joy, every time.\n\nAbove all, be sure that you're prepared for each blood moon; they're coming for your crown.","December 28, 2015","true","13.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is primarily done through the use of only one resource; gold. This really helps sometimes as you don't have to worry about if you have enough food, if you have enough arrows, if you have enough water, etc. Drop gold to hire people, buy bows and buy hammers for your people to use, and build up your defences.\n\nThe difficulty is something that I found really weird. During regular nights, very few monsters will spawn and they will easily be killed by youor archers. But about every five nights, there is a blood moon. Similar to Terraria, during a blood moon, lots of difficult enemies will spawn and it is often on these nights that you will have to restart. The difficulty is cranked up to eleven and even if the monsters don't get all the way to your campfire, you will probably lose a few archers, maybe a catapult and a wall, which spends most of the the next days money repairing.\n\nOne thing that will annoy quite a lot of people is that the locations for certain buildings are in fixed locations; you have no way to choose where to build your walls or towers. While I did quite like not having to worry about this, many people would like to have that freedom.\n\nAnother issue is that some statues and camps that you desperately need to use to survive are hidden deep into the forest and it takes the entire day just to go there and get what you need. This can sometimes make the game end quite quickly because if your horse is out of stamina and can't gallop in time to get back to safety, monsters will spawn and take away your crown.\n\nA deeper tutorial would be nice as the only help you get is press down to throw money to recruit people, hold down to buy, hold down to build. One time, after reaching day 18, I expanded and had a knight group form. This would've been amazing if I knew what they did. I walked over to them and saw the option to pay for something. I thought, "I can upgrade them! I needed something to do with my money!" They walked off into the jungle to defeat the enemy portal. That night, with a significant number of my army gone, I was overrun. Which wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to go through all 18 days again.\n\nA final issue I have is that though your can hire archers and build catapults, your character has no defense. Even one monster can kill you as you have no bow or sword and even though this pushes the concept that you need to defend your kingdom, it does feel a little unfair sometimes as your defences are breached and you can do nothing about it.\n\nIn closing, although I have said a lot of negative things about this game, it is still an enjoyable and addicting game. Even after frustration, I always come back to try again. There's always another way you can try, and the game goes on for a long time; one of the achievements is to survive 100 days. Even through the vey simple resource gathering and spending mechanic, there is still a lot of depth and strategy in the game.","December 29, 2015","true","10.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a war of attrition and the enemies supply of bodies is limitless and your ability to build and defend your Kingdom is limited by your currency, the speed of your horse, and the number of villagers you can recruit.\n\nGive this game a shot.

I enjoy a lot about it. But there are some fundamental flaws that make it unplayable past a certain point.\n\n- Because of its sidescrolling nature as you expand your kingdom your walls (where all the action takes place) become further and further away from your main camp (where all your weapons come from) and of course the other side of your kingdom. At a certain point you have to spend all your time just riding back and forth on a horse that will only run half of the time. It's very unfulfilling. This could be softened by other tasks to perform while on your way back and forth.\n\n- The NPC AI is crap. I see a lot of people complaining about how they're too slow and not a good shot with a bow. I actually don't have a problem with that. I think that they're balanced well enough against the enemy. However, they don't have a good sense about where the enemy is or which direction they're coming from. If the enemy horde breaks through all your walls from one direction and crosses your main camp all your troops still face the other way and allow the enemy to just come up from behind and slaughter them. If they just knew that the enemy was coming from the other direction and stood at the opposite wall it would be much more balanced.\n\n- Another AI issue is this: when you recruit troops they will automatically split their numbers between both sides of your camp. BUT they will all clump at the most outward wall on either side. As you expand your kingdom you end up with many walls in layers going outward. But those walls don't do any good if there aren’t any troops standing behind them to shoot the enemy. If they would just split their numbers between each wall then you would have a much better fortified defense.\n\n- ALSO when you build towers the troops prioritize filling those first. Even if it's far outside your wall or right at your main camp where they will sit and do nothing because all the action is at the farthest wall. They should prioritize only the towers nearest to your most outward wall.\n\n- And finally, at a certain point it becomes literally impossible to recruit more troops. Troops come from camps in the woods. You can recruit 3-4 a day if you're diligent. But as you expand your kingdom you take over these camps and there is nowhere for new recruits to spawn. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem because when your troops "die" they actually just lose loyalty and walk away. You can just catch them and pay them to come back. BUT during the later days more and more flyers come and take your troops away. I went from about 60 troops to maybe 15 in the course of 10 days (2 blood moons). And I literally couldn't recruit any more. Either the flyers should not be taking your troops or there should be a more reliable way to recruit more.\n\nAll that being said, I actually did really enjoy playing it.

Completed Game\nIf $10 means the world to you not recommended. Enjoyable game even flawed worth the $10 if you can spare.\nEarly game 10/10\nLate game -100/10\n\n\nThe concept is amazing, graphics wonderful, great strategy base.\nTutorial is vague it introduces controls, part of the game is to figure out all its wonders there is secrets to upgrading your army, workers and increases to your horses viability. Timing is everything. Economising your wealth is also everything. For the first portion of the game loved it.\n\nPast a day 20-30 point the whole strategy base goes out the window and the only strategy left to combat the hordes is to stack and stack and stack this leads to massive spikes in lag as your fps drops trying to render coins, workers/army, and horde waves particularly on blood moons.","November 28, 2015","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Using gold obtained through your townsfolk, you can purchase tools to give them roles such as farming, hunting and even becoming one of your knights to defend against monsters. So what is good about the game?\n\nPros:\n\n+ Gorgeous pixel art\n+ Building your own kingdom from scratch and investing in it however you wish.\n+ The game does not hold your hand by giving you in-depth tutorials. It gives you controls and basic  mechanics, but that is it.\n+ Easy to pick up.\n+ A one-life system, though frustrating at times, really puts pressure on your decision making when outside your walls.\n\nCons:\n\n- Losing your crown to monsters when you run out of money in the wilderness. Time to restart.\n- Losing your crown to monsters after your horse runs out of stamina. Time to restart.\n- Having a large kingdom can make it take a while (up to half a day cycle) to get from one end of the map to the other.\n- Later on in the game, it can get fairly laggy with a large mass of monsters assaulting your walls.\n- Slow moving units make it difficult for them to get anything done when your kingdom gets very large.\n- A little bare, but this could be solved with some additions in future.\n\nNevertheless, I recommend picking it up if it has a sale, it'd be well worth the money. If most of the glaring issues such as the slow units and fair lack of content are fixed, then this game would be well worth the price.","November 8, 2015","true","47.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When I later expand, they can't move to the front line...\n- After clearing the portals on one side, the army just sits there and it still recieves new archers.\n- catapults... omg - There's NEVER an engineer there to reload - and it's NEVER in the right position.\n\n2/ Difficulty - wayyy too easy\n3/ Too much money late game with nothing to spend it on..\n4/ MORE upgrades (magic? swordsman? bigger towers? More castle upgrades? a better horse?)\n5/ Minimap - so I know where I fricking am\n6/ Merchant - not be give random tools..\n7/ King / Queen should have a melee attach, or battlecry or something.\n8/ The horse...

And that was kind of experience!\n\nThe game mechanics is simple. Invest coins in people / buildings (at pre-defined locations). Take more coins as an output of these investments. Build defences. Learn game rules by trying new things.\n\nHowever the gameplay turns out to be really challenging and intence. You have to invest in proper things, take investments timely, defend and build wisely. Even the time of the day matters much. And after the kingdom is lost (and you'll loose because of your mistakes), try again and make it at least for 5 days longer.\n\nThe pixel-style is great! Music is also nice.\n\nP.S. for devs.\nWish there would be more decorations / map styles later (sands? winter?).\nAlso I'd prefer to take items from the ground and drop them in the city. That could add some new mechanics and simplify the "aftermatch" rebuilding.","December 6, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is not a difficult game to master. It requires clever strategies, quick decision-making and time management skills but once you understand its mechanics you enjoy the challenge of seeing how long you can last.\n\nKingdom has received a few patches since I purchased it on day one and they have improved the gameplay significantly. It is still lacking some end-game content which I'm sure they will add in future patches but so far I have been hooked for about 30 hours which is not bad for a $10 game.\n\nHighly recommended.","December 4, 2015","true","29.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
