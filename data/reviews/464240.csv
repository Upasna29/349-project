Has a few different scenarios depending on your actions. Only 3 chapters and about 3 hours of gameplay but there is some replay value for achievements and different endings for each chapter. I would love to see some DLC or even a second game with new chapters and new characters. This game is definitely worth the $5 if you like detective games/books/movies.","May 23","true","4.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

(lol not really)\nYour basic detective game where you investigate things and collect evidence with that black and white noir style art :D\nI like the short chapters and the various choices I could make that may lead to different endings on each chapter. Sometimes I forgot that I was a detective and not an attorney (lol) so dying is actually possible when confronting a suspect.\n\nCons: No skip button for read text, only 2 save slots, autosave only, no settings option. basically just technical stuff XP","May 24","true","10.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Definitely buy it if you are interested in a game that makes you find out the answer for yourself. Heaps of fun, definitely worth the money. Really really fun.\n\n8/10, would solve murder again.","May 27","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You collect evidence, talk to witnesses and solve mysteries (kind of reminded me of Ace Attorney series). Depending on how you act story plays out differently. Game has three cases in total, took me 5 hours to complete one playthrough.","May 26","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When a game does not have voice acting, the script needs to be grammatically correct.  I can get the gist of what they are saying, but it prevents me from  enjoying the game.","May 27","false","0.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"
