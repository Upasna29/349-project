The FMV style combined with the (for a reason) incredibly cliché characters and disturbing story makes for a very unique experience. It's really hard to describe in a way that does it justice, but it's a shameless gorefest in a very D-movie way.\n\nOn the other hand, the last part of the game includes some of the clunkiest, jankiest and infuriatingly bad combat I've ever seen in a game, and it's just about enough to make you wish you were getting a root canal instead of playing it.\n\nIs the game recommendable? If you're really into adventure games, yes. If you want a very unique game, yes. If you have a low (or normal) tolerance for deeply flawed game mechanics, no. If you're easily offended, definitely no. I'm still going to say it evens out to "yes", but I always was a kidder.","October 27, 2014","true","0.4"," 62 of 73 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","62","73","3","0"

A relic from a bygone era deserving of its' cult status\n\nThe games worst aspect is its combat, no question. The first 2 acts are traditional point and click style with the 3rd heavily incorporating combat additionally. While you CAN kill people in the first 2 acts there aren't many reasons to do so and there are consequences, many of them fail states. So when it came time to unleash I found it a welcome change of pace which added a nice, albeit frustrating at times, survival horror element towards the end. I managed to quite enjoy it despite its shortcomings but I understand why that isn't a popular sentiment. The timing of attacks is mostly luck but choosing the right weapon can make things a lot easier. Also there are opportunities to talk your way around some confrontations.\n\nIf you are a horror fan (particularly if you have an eye for satire/ social commentary) and are craving an interesting story (even if, like myself, you aren't overly fond of the point and click genre) you owe it to yourself to pick this up at some point and persevere 'til the bitter end/s.\n\nIf you're the type to take the Metacritic score into account I advise you to take note of the disparity between the critical and user reviews.\n\nThere's also a GOG version if you'd prefer.\n\n. . . and if you'd like to see a review which mostly echoes my feelings toward Harvester then this LGR review is pretty close but it contains some SPOILERS, so fair warning.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtjAsQIPauY","November 9, 2014","true","28.5"," 44 of 51 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","44","51","0","0"

Beautiful and gory in all it's campy glory. Reminiscent of Phantasmagoria, in a more...Evil Dead kind of way.\n\nFeaturing delightfully absurd dialogues that are sometimes unexpectedly insightful, a batshit crazy ending and buckets of black, morbid humor. If you have even the slightest taste for horror you should definitelly check this old gem.\n\nI love old games like this one. At the time the different genres of gaming weren't so clear-cut as they are today. Not having the imperative to be separated in perfect little boxes in order to identify a game as "adventure", "action" etc, resulted in games like Harvester. A game with heavy adventure elements, timed events, combats, different weapons you can actually aim and use, ammo to manage and of course, many deaths.\n\nThere is a weird exhilarating sense of freedom in that lack of genre labeling in gameplay. You can't follow the patterns modern adventure games use, so even simple things may have an unexpected aspect to them. This kind of freedom in a game's design makes it more interesting -and of course, at times, harder to beat.*\n\nUnfortunately Harvester also carries with it the sexist tropes of the era, so if you can't stomach good old sexism, a touch of homophobia, gratuitous sex scenes, ladies in lingerie and violence against women then you should probably choose another game. I was able to enjoy it despite of this, but I can't say that this will be the case for everyone.\n\n\n*But, thankfully,  in case you get stuck, it has one of the most beloved "features" of old games: cheat codes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amaine/recommended/287020/","amaine","I love depressing VNs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amaine/","91 products in account","So I bought this game recently cause it was on sale, and also because I watched a playthrough of it a long time ago. It tells the intriguing story of a young man named Steve, who finds himself in the mysterious town "Harvest" after waking up with amnesia. The town is populated with a couple dozen people, most vastly differing from one another, producing a nice cast of memorable and unique characters. Steve, the main character, is personally my favourite. I love his dialogue and I found myself connecting to him and his situation -- something that doesn't usually happen for me.\n\nThroughout the game you will uncover the secrets of Harvest, most opening up more questions than answers. This adds to the mystery of the town, producing a nice spooky vibe which fits it's horror genre. While playing I found myself simultaneously laughing, crying, and cringing; it's the perfect combination of humour and disgust. You can't help but feel pity for Steve, who like you has no idea what's going on or why he's there.\n\nA warning to anyone squeamish: This game is not for the lighthearted. Though the graphics may be older, some of the cutscenes are surprisingly brutal, and without going into too much detail, very gory. There's no real jumpscares though, which is nice. Just be wary that at any second a cutscene could come out of nowhere. There's child/baby death in this game too, which may (understandly) bother some people. In general, the farther you progress the more gory it gets. So if you are faint of heart, I advise you not to play this game.\n\nPROS:\n-Great story with somewhat satisfying conclusions\n-Amazing characters\n-Not afraid of it's audience\n-Decent voice acting\n-Great cutscenes\n-Graphics aren't bad for an older game\n-Steve\n\nCONS:\n-Fighting is lackluster\n-Some may find endings unsatisfactory\n-Gets pretty weird (it's for you to decide if this is a good or a bad thing)\n-Dead babies, mutilated children, wounded cats, blah blah blah\n-Too many wasps\n-Steve is a kidder\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy classic horrors with unique charm and a weird, crazy plot. If you're looking for a game that'll make you question what the f**k is going on, then this game is for you. If older graphics really bother you then they may be a problem, but personally they were good enough to make me genuinely scared at some points (which is good enough for me). Basically, just buy this game. I promise you you won't find another one like it.\n","November 4, 2015","true","1.9"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","29","31","5","0"

What sets it apart from other games in its genre is how insane it is.  This game has things in it that would not stand a chance at making it into releases today.  Sure, blood and gore are pretty common today, but when it involves children, it's just completely taboo now.  Not surprisingly, Harvester has a pretty decent sized cult following.  It was hit hard when it was released by negative criticism for its gameplay but mostly for its content.  It definitely broke no ground with its gameplay and its content is pretty shocking.  I found the tone of the game to be just perfect.  It is just creepy beyond reason.  Kind of like a cheesy horror flick or something.  The characters are so over the top with their insanity it almost makes you feel uncomfortable.  The game has humor, but the humor is also...insane.  I really love it.  Check it out.

(I might SPOIL some parts of the game or more so don't read if you hate spoilers)\n\nThe best way I can describe Harvester in my opinion is the perfect serial killer simulator because of the bizarre atmosphere of the town of Harvest, the unsettling NPCs of this small town like Mr. Pottsham (obsessed with meat) who is a molester & a pervert who likes watching Stephanie 24/7 (I don't blame him Stephanie has nice cur...... errr let's continue) or Steve's "mother" who is an extreme BDSM enthusiast (That ♥♥♥♥♥ has all sorts of other issues which I won't mention) & don't forget the stages of a serial killer which you can read here http://www.criminalmindsfanwiki.com/page/Psychological+Phases if you wish.\n\nPuzzle wise the game wants you to think illogical & dangerous the entire game so you have all the time in the world to do stupid ♥♥♥♥ before you get the electric chair by the corrupt police who are extremely delusional, lazy & idiotic towards real crimes like arson or attempted murder, the combat is the biggest flaw the game has because it is cringeworthy & broken the entire game so it is based on luck but I forgive this flaw because Harvester gave amazing writing from Gilbert P. Austin who is the same guy who made Wing Commander 2 so to me it looks like he never made a horror game before https://archive.today/YFfTK but sometimes inexperience is the best thing just take a look at the success of Goldeneye 64 which was made by inexperienced devs. https://archive.today/iMybh\n\nPros:\n\n1. Amazing story\n\n2. Bizarre atmosphere\n\n3. Unsettling NPCs\n\n4. Very ♥♥♥♥ed up\n\n5. Awesome Music like this piano piece for example http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf1krRBwjRE (The rest of the game's music is a masterpiece)\n\nCons:\n\n1. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat\n\n2. A few items like the tampons for example are useless\n\nOverall this game is worth the time & money if your not offended easily so I suggest everyone to play this cult classic title because today's horror can't make gems like these anymore & besides Steve was always a kidder so give him some slack.\n\nUPDATE: I found an interview about the Stephanie actress & how she ended up working for Gilbert Austin https://www.facebook.com/notes/harvester-pc-game/interview-lisa-cangelosi/525709370815394\n\nFor a bonus this is what she does now for a living http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORv8qPXavh4\n\nUPDATE 2: Here is a two part interview with the mastermind of Harvester https://www.facebook.com/notes/harvester-pc-game/interview-gilbert-austin-part-1/619663171420013\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/notes/harvester-pc-game/interview-gilbert-austin-part-2/702809679772028\n\nUPDATE 3: Here is an interview with the voice of Steve & the Sergeant at Arms https://www.facebook.com/notes/harvester-pc-game/interview-ryan-wickerham/588985577821106\n\nUPDATE 4: Here is an interview with the actor who played our fav character Steve https://www.facebook.com/notes/harvester-pc-game/interview-kurt-kistler/544620568924274\n\nFor a bonus this is where he is now http://mugshots.com/US-Counties/Texas/Dallas-County-TX/Kurt-Stephen-Kistler.8684252.html\n\nUPDATE 5: Here is an interview with the composer of Harvester https://www.facebook.com/notes/harvester-pc-game/interview-hamilton-altstatt/575250429194621","April 30, 2014","true","26.0"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","3"

It's dark & creepy and it does that job well. The english version of this on Steam is uncensored, btw. I am thoroughly enjoying this. If you like twisted PNC/adventure games, this one is definitely worth a try. Or, if you enjoy any sort of twisted game, like Postal, Postal 2 or horror like Sanitarium, Dark Seed or I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream.\n\nThere aren't many adventure/PNC games that within a few seconds of beginning to play, you have the gameplay option(s) to kill a bunch of people, including children. Not that that should be a selling point but I do like seeing artistic freedom in this manner. It is a game for adults, I wouldn't recommend anyone under 16 or 18 to play it unless they were really mature/played a lot of adventure games.","December 5, 2014","true","15.9"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I was going to.\n\nThe game took me 18 hours to complete, but that is because while playing I went back in saves to explored every possible outcome of each situation and to hear all the dialogue possible in each conversation depending on the questions I asked or answers I gave. If you rush through the game you can probably beat it in half that time.\n\n\nA few technical tips if you do pick up this game.\n\nSave often, especially later in the game. The game allows you to save 25 times before having to overwrite old saves. This is for 2 reasons. One, there are a lot of situations where there are different outcomes depending on what you say or do and you may want a recent save point to try out all the options without having to go back to an old save and repeat a bunch of stuff. Two, this game is run through DosBox and it has problems with skipping some of the cutscenes.\n\nIn the DosBox settings (steamapps\common\Harvester\dosbox_windows\dosbox_harvester.conf) you will want to set a certain cycle number to play at and then use the cycle down and up shortcuts (ctrl F11 & F12) while in game when you get to a cutscene that was skipped. I used these settings, but you may need to adjust them a little for your computer: cycles=28000, cycleup=20000, cycledown=20000, aspect=true. When a cutscene is skipped, load the previous save (beginning of that conversation if you are saving a lot), press F11 to drop the cycles down to allow the cutscene to play and then press F12 to bring them back up so the game plays faster and smooth again. I had to do this on probably about 20% of the cutscenes, the others played fine. You can also adjust your mouse sensitivity in the DosBox settings. You may notice that your mouse cursor moves horizontal faster than vertical, I could not fix this.\n\nYou may want to get a pen and paper while playing. When you talk to people in the game, new subjects will appear that you can talk about just like in most point and click games, but in Harvester you cannot click through every subject because sometimes when you pick one subject the others will not be there after. There is a box that says "other" and you can type in subjects to talk about, but you have to remember the exact title of the subject. I chose to write down the subjects each time I talked to someone and then crossed them off after I did each one. That way I can type in the others that disappeared and get to hear all the great dialogue.

While my friend and I thought it was the bloodiest, most disgusting game ever made, I can look back on it now and laugh; the cartoon-y gore is clearly supposed to be over-the-top and played for laughs (see: the "spinal cord" scene on YouTube). Very much in the same vein as Sierra's Phantasmagoria, but with much lower production values.\n\nHarvester is split into two parts: Discs 1 and 2 are the "adventure" segments which involve running around town and collecting clues, not unlike the first Phantasmagoria (which had much better acting, IMHO). The last disc spins the title off into somewhat of an action sequence in which you climb, floor-by-floor, the mysterious Lodge building full of total whackos (whom you are given the choice of helping or killing with a variety of tools, including a nail gun, katana or shotgun).\n\nThis is just a straight-up emulated port of the MS-DOS version, complete with all the glitches and crashes I experienced fifteen years ago. Do yourself a favor and use the "enchanced" DosBOX program [the second option] from the launcher when playing: it speeds up the loading times during the FMV sequences.\n\nPros: Killer music (at least the rock tracks in the Lodge), funny dialogue, interesting ending.\nCons: Choppy animation, faulty game engine, horrible combat design -- it's a buggy game.","April 16, 2014","true","4.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

As well as exceedingly violent, the game is also homophobic, misogynistic, and generally rife with unpleasantries; be aware that the game is designed as satirical self-parody, intended for consenting adults only.\n\nConcerning gameplay: what begins as an interactive B-movie eventually evolves into something quite different, along the way featuring plenty of tongue-in-cheek commentary on violence and death (within the video game medium and without).  Mature adults will laugh at the game's goofiness and gore, but will also understand the point being made using all the blood and insanity.\n\nSave often, use multiple save files, and expect lots of reloading.","November 19, 2014","true","19.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Now let me start off by saying Harvester is NOT for everyone. Do I  myself love this game? Yes I do but for those easily offended or for those faint of heart I suggest staying away although I highly recommend the game it's audience is not aimed at those people but if you are still curious I would say it's worth looking into for sure just be prepared for what you are getting yourself into.\n\nYou start off the game with some 90's FMV sequences and the introduction of your main character Steve. Oh what a kidder Steve is along his journey he will uncover who he is and what is the deal with this Stepford Suburbian's town of Harvest. There will be many a zany characters in this such as the soon to be stepdad who loves meat human or otherwise , the gay firemen.....dare I say they are flaming!? , The Wasp Woman and even your own mom be careful on asking her to have sex she just might take you up on that offer......uh.. yeah okay. Anyways the mechanic's are your typical point and click fashion except no real way to get permanently stuck thank goodness but I would recommend saving often. You never know when that Officer who has no legs with PTSD will gun you down and set off the rockets killing you all.\n\nYou will soon be introudced to all these characters and the more important ones such as Stephanie your soon to be wife who is in the same situation as you are with no recollection of what happened before or what is going on now and the Sergeant at Arms who is associated with this "lodge" everyone in town is obsessed with. What is the meaning behind it? Well it's your job to find out the Sergeant will task you with multiple things to do to pass the days and uncover the lodge's mysteries. There are multiple endings and some "dead end" endings too so watch out. Overall it's a really fun game with tons of satire , metaphors , violent for the sake of being violent , goofyness cheezy for the sake of being cheezy (and for the plot) so if all of that sounds good and catching STDs from hookers then this game is for you!","December 15, 2014","true","21.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

The characters and situations are so terminally freaking weird that I honestly felt like I was high for the first hour of the story.  As the game continues it progresses from merely strange through to disturbing and finally ending on outright horror.  By the end, blood and gore are omnipresent, and it all becomes so over the top it's laughable while still being gross.\n\nUnfortunately that wonderfully odd ambiance is broken due to two flaws in the game.  Some of the puzzles tend to be on the more obscure side, as in nearly impossible to figure out unless you have a walk-through guide.  Fortunately, steam provides one.  Also, you'll want to create numerous separate save files at various points throughout the game, since you *can* get locked into situations were you may have neglected to pick up an item which was critical to completing the game, but it's impossible to backtrack to retrieve it.

It was the first game in a very, very long time I had to beat in one sitting simply due to how enjoyable it was. The characters are wacky, silly, and zany in the most bizarre of ways, but are that way intentionally done incredibly well by the game's excellent writing. The game has a wonderful atmosphere as well, which feels to be bleak, and gives off that vibe of what is powerlessness and entrapment within a prison of insanity.\n\nThen there's a let-down. On the fifth and final day, the game does a U-Turn in almost every aspect.  Gameplay-wise, it switches genres and becomes survival horror, which does not work at all with a point-and-click interface. The endings that the entire game built up to so incredibly well are also half-baked and nonsensical.\n\nHarvester delivers an experience like no other.

I was never able to even get to the lodge.  How could this be?  I was stuck.  I had to go look for a walkthrough.  I realized the first problem.  I didn't pick up the pen and quarter from the drawer.  Of course, I should have been looking around my room, and opened the drawer.  Well, I did.  I clicked on the bookshelf, and I only got a description and I clicked on the closet next to my bed, and I only got a description.  I assumed that everything that can be examined would only be examined.  To prove my (incorrect) point even more, I tried to open the oven and cabinet in the kitchen.  None were able to be opened.\n\nSo, how could I differentiate between stuff that can be opened, and stuff that can't?  Well, there isn't any way.  I can’t even have my mouse over the drawer to know weather it can be opened.  I always get the “examine” cursor, so I would have to click on everything that has the examine cursor.\n\nThe same thing goes for items, but there aren’t that many items that are able to be picked up, so it’s not that bad.\n\nIt's not that the game is too hard, but if I have to click on every possible thing that can be opened (or look at a walkthrough), it just becomes tedious.\n\nThere could be a way to make it possible to know weather something can be opened after being examined, or if it would just be able to be examined.  A glow could be possible.\n\nIt does take a little bit of realism out if there is a way to know weather something opened or not.  It is needed to examine everything to know weather there is something important in it.  Then everything that can (in real life) be opened should show the contents, but since that would take too much time to program, and it would have nothing to do with the game itself, it would be good to only let things that are needed for the game to be able to open.  Since it takes a little bit of realism out, it would be a good idea to go a little bit further and have a way to know weather something can be opened or not just by looking.\n\nThe game has good graphics for it's time, and even though it was from 1995, it can still be ran with modern computers.  The game starts of slow, but gets gory fast.  I would recommend this because someone looking at this game would want something gory.  If I would review this game for the average person, I would not recommend it.\n\nThis game is great, but it's not for everyone.  If you want an interesting storyline, and is very gory, this is right for you.","April 30","true","19.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But Harvester just doesn't cut it. To review an adventure game, we need to talk about the setting and the story a bit, so the following may contain small spoilers, but don't worry: real spoilers will be hidden like so yup, like this.\n\nThe story\n\nYou play Steve, who wakes up in the town of Harvest with amnesia. He doesn't remember anything or anyone, but everyone seems to know him and everyone seems to know he has amnesia before he tells them ("they heard about it"). On top of that, everyone looks bizarre and everyone acts completely psycho. Everyone except Stephanie, who's supposed to be Steve's fiancee, but they both don't remember anything. You see, Stephanie has amnesia just like Steve. Steve will go explore the town to find out what's going on.\n\nAt first, it's fun to explore the town and talk to the people, who are all complete nutjobs. But soon, the behavior of the main characters becomes outright unbelievable and you won't care much what they have to say anymore, you will just keep playing because you're curious to know what is going on and what type of creatures these so-called townspeople are. To discover that, you need to gain access to 'the lodge'.\n\nThe gameplay\n\nGameplay is classic point and click. Find items, combine them in your inventory and use them on things or people. There are a few points in the game where I had to look up a walkthrough. When I read the solution I never had the feeling it was completely impossible to guess, but it would sometimes have taken me hours to come up with it myself.\n\nOnce you enter the lodge, the gameplay changes drastically. Fighting becomes a large part of the game. Now in my opinion, an adventure game shouldn't become a fighting game all of a sudden, especially when it has a combat system that's just awful. And the most infuriating part is that the last part of the game is just one fight after another. No more story or anything, just about a dozen or so fights. It feels like a bad Mortal Kombat or Streetfighter game. And because healing items are scarce, you will need to reload almost every time you get hit or you won't make it to the end.\n\nBut you persist, because you're almost at the end of the game and you haven't even received the smallest bit of information about what the hell is going on. And then, the final cutscene explains the plot, and it's the biggest anticlimax in an adventure game ever. It turns out none of it was real. Everything from the first second of the game up to the end was just a virtual reality, an illusion. This made me yawn in anger. A long time ago, a tv series called Dallas pulled this off and really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the fans by stating the whole previous season was just a dream. More recently, the tv series Lost pretty much did the same at the end of their final season. Well, here you play an adventure game wondering what the explanation is for all the weird things that happen and for the weird behaviour of the people, and the explanation is: "It didn't really happen. Roll the credits!" Bah!\n\nConclusion\n\nNah, I don't recommend Harvester. The first part is somewhat fun, but the second part isn't and the ending just makes you want to shout cursewords at your screen. If you're looking for a good FMV, I recommend Gabriel Knight 2. Phantasmagoria isn't bad either. I even enjoyed Phantasmagoria 2 more than I did Harvester, and people who played both these games will know that's a bold statement ;-)","June 2","false","10.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/recommended/287020/","Sweatbandz","A_Sweatband","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/","254 products in account","Harvester is a sometimes uncomfortable mix of oddly done social commentary, and a collection of sometimes awful ironic funny moments delievered in the style of an odd D-List FMV game.\n\nYou play as Steve, the Plaid shirt wearing kidder of Harvester. You wonder around Harvester, trying to remember what's what as you suffer from amnesia all of a sudden. Harvester is from the odd age of PC games, or at least right at the end of it. The game is a point 'n' click, complete with odd plots, pixel hunting, and sometimes hilariously woeful animations, visualisations and 'great' voice acting. The game tries to mix things up near the end, with very mixed results, with some sections coming off as boring or weak compared to the rest of the game.\n\nThe quirk, is that nothing is ordinary. People are obsessed with anything, be it corpses, meat, wasps, or whatever else. FMV cutscenes tell the story hilariously. As mentioned before, the voice acting and ridiculous writing that would ruin any other game gives Harvester an excellent personality. Be it staring at Spinal Cords and thinking about pie, or be it becoming somewhat genuinely disturbing, Harvester's plot is memorable because of its plot is its greatest quirk.\n\nVisually, it’s an FMV game, and you can tell by looking at it that it's an FMV. The characters feature quite a bit of animation considering this. Unfortunately, dialogue is not animated, but it is fully voiced by Harvester's all-star cast, which although all sound really odd, perfectly portray the screwed up world that Steve inhabits. The environments are extremely weird, and the cutscenes featuring full-motion video are extremely strange.\n\nThe soundtrack is very varied, featuring a variety of different music. Although it sometimes seems unsuitable, once again because of the weirdness this game strives in, I can't tell if this is intentional, or if it’s just really shoddy design.\n\nOverall, there isn't much you can say about Harvester. Harvester is just a bloody weird game, and because Harvester is so weird, I have to recommend this to as many people as possible. The game is just weird, and deserves some attention now, being a breath of fresh air in the modern day of serious, competitive gaming. Although the game gets weaker near the end, there is plenty of meat here to keep you entertained, despite its stupidity.","March 2, 2015","true","3.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Some of the tools you need are hard to find, and it can get a bit frustrating at times; However, the game does have tips, and once you figure out the solution it really feels like you've accomplished something. The gameplay is standard for the point and click genre, but there is some combat thrown in. HERE'S where the game gets a little nasty.\n\nThe combat is terrible. It feels clunky, unresponsive and boring. This would be forgivable if it were sparse, but during the last third of the game it's almost the only thing you do. In fact, the entire last third of the game is probably the weakest part, simply because of all the combat and that the area you have to trudge through is feels very disjointed.\n\nThe atmosphere is fantastic. I really felt alone while I explored the town, and the fact that there is no clear goal from the start made me feel all the more involved. I was really interested by the town of Harvest, and I really wanted to learn more. In fact, the story is a big part of why I kept playing. Along with the fun puzzles and creepy environments, the story really pulled me in. I was interested in the world of Harvest, and I wanted to see the mystery unfold.\n\nCharacter interaction makes up most of the first third of the game, and its done very well. All of the characters are unique and memorable in some way, from the meat obsessed father of your bride-to-be, to the school teacher who punishes disobedient children with a baseball bat. Some characters will die, some characters will evolve into something much more sinister.\n\nThough the graphics are dated, the world feels like a lot of detail was put into it, and I couldn't help but feel creeped out every time I stepped into the mortuary. The soundtrack contributes to this feeling, with tracks ranging from a relaxed radio tune to a tense nighttime heist.\n\nThroughout the story, you are forced into more and more uncomfortable situations; Maybe you start by scratching a car, but soon enough you'll be burning down a diner. After every task you complete, you are able to talk to the townsfolk and witness their reactions to what's happening around them. I felt immersed in the world and interested in what everybody had to say.\n\nThe cheesiness does show through sometimes, though; when it did, I couldn't help but laugh. This game mixes humor and horror perfectly, allowing for some scenarios that other games don't.\nFor instance: There is an armed gaurd (who happens to be missing both of his legs) you talk to at  a few points during the game, and you soon find out that he controls a group of nuclear missiles that could cause a holocaust. If you continue to talk to him, he will accuse you of being a communist. If you do not persuade him that you are not, in fact, a "pink-blooded commie", then he will shoot you in the forehead and then accidentally set off all of the missiles (with gore out the wazoo, of course).\nIts scenes like these that help to keep the atmosphere campy and fun despite the serious undertone of the game, and I feel that it makes it one of the most memorable point and click games that I have ever played.\n\nAverage game time will differ depending on the person. Some people will skip most of the dialogue and rush through the game, while others (such as myself) prefer to "smell the roses", so to speak. I personally recommend playing it at a moderate pace, because if you go through it too fast you might miss some of the great scenes and fantastic writing. It took me about nine hours to play through the game at a fairly slow pace, talking to all the characters and examinating all of the objects. It is possible to beat this game in around five hours, but that's if you're really rushing.\n\nAll in all, this is one of my favorite point and click games of all time, despite the lazily implemented combat and bugs. So if you can stomach the gore and enjoy some campy horror every once in a while, than I would highly recommend this game. I can guaruntee that if you enter with the right expectations and an open mind, you won't be disappointed.\n\nJOIN THE LODGE","May 12, 2014","true","9.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The main pro of this game would definitely be it's atmosphere, a wicked version of 50s USA created in the 90s with cheesy dialogues and acting. You may find yourself pushing forward just because you want to discover all the unreal wonders of Harvest.\n\nUnfortunately the game is not remastered or anything, it's emulated through DOSbox with most of the inconveniences of the initial release, very low resolution, cutscenes problems, infamous twitchy and not-fun-at-all combat.\nAnother huge problem would be second part of the game, it revolves around combat and is more linear, like most of the other point'n'clicks.\nWhat's more about that part is mandatory item hunting, as the game does not allow the slightest backtracking then, which means that if you haven't picked up a crucial puzzle piece and saved on only one slot.....well, have fun starting from monday.\n\nI picked it up knowing what it is, and for those who don't, but are curious- some guides/walkthroughs and multiple saves may make the game playable instead of tedious.\nI like some of the more original and funny games like this one, but then again- I always was a kidder.","July 15, 2015","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as a character called Steve who wakes up in town called Harvest somewhere in the 50's. He doesn't remember why or how he got there, and he can't recognize his not-so-idyllic family. Pretty soon he starts to realize that things are very, very wrong in this small town. And the only one besides Steve who realizes this, is his soon-to-be fiance who lives next door. The true nature Harvest will unveil as you progress through the game.\n\nGameplay is exactly like you would expect from any point and click adventure game from the 90's. You walk through different parts of the town gathering stuff and trying to figure out whats going on while talking to all the peculiar characters in the town. The game has its share of some flawed and obscure puzzles. The game also has some extremely clunky combat elements, but you won't be needing combat till much later in the game, so it doesn't really matter.\nYou can also kill every character in this game if you want to, but you'll be sent to the electric chair if theres any witnesses around.\n\nGraphics are pretty abysmal by todays standards, but I think it just brings more charm into this game. Not to mention all the greenscreen cutscenes which were so hilariously bad that they were funny as hell.\n\nOverall, this game is a rare gem and should be played by anyone who enjoys old-school adventure games and/or downright ♥♥♥♥ed up games.","April 8, 2015","true","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

The acting/ voice acting is pretty good for it's time. I see alot of reviews complaining about the acting but honestly... It's from 1996 and I think it's impressive for a game of that year.\n\nThis version plays in a DOSBox, and for some reason steam overlay won't work with it. So not really a differents in getting the GOG version besides the trading cards and the steam game time counter.\n\nOveral the  game has no bugs besides the ocation where the FLV cutscenes freeze for a while before they start or they just skip (if the cutscene is like one second, so nothing valuable lost.)\nAnother slight problem is that somethimes the game could freeze, this happens often while being in dialogue with people after their last sentences. A right mouse click will unfreeze it.\nThe game is also forced 4:3.\n\n\nThe gameplay is fluent, altough the game is very hard to figure by yourself out. There are moments when you HAVE to look up a guide. Just because you can get easily stuck. Also if you want to buy the game and want to play for the first time a blindly walktrough then I recommend you to save the game often. If you pick a wrong choice in the storyline then you could be f*cked for the rest of your game, or the storyline might just be stuck forever.","April 26","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Starting out the game you think its some kind of over the top game you would expect from Troma Entertainment; everything from the dialouge to the senarios you end up in all seem to have been chosen randomly to make the game even worse on porpose. Nothing really makes sense til the ending of the game when (If you are smart enough) you realize this game is a satire on violence, at least that's what I got out of the ending. The game is badly acted and that along with the dialouge make even the serious points in this game macabre comedy gold, sadly  there isn't much replayability to the game and it can be beaten with a walk through in about five hours but it took me at least 12 withouth any help.

Starting out the game you think its some kind of over the top game you would expect from Troma Entertainment; everything from the dialouge to the senarios you end up in all seem to have been chosen randomly to make the game even worse on porpose. Nothing really makes sense til the ending of the game when (If you are smart enough) you realize this game is a satire on violence, at least that's what I got out of the ending. The game is badly acted and that along with the dialouge make even the serious points in this game macabre comedy gold, sadly  there isn't much replayability to the game and it can be beaten with a walk through in about five hours but it took me at least 12 withouth any help.

So I have decided to try it now. I thought that it would be good adventure with quite abstract story, but I was wrong. Yes, the "story" is really abstract. But the game is not good at all. I don't care too much about obsolete graphic, clunky controls, but I care about gameplay in general.\nThis game can be completed without walkthroughs/hints only if you have at least some skill in telepathy, because gameplay here consists only of searching items that you will need in future. And you rarely know what developers want from you right now. For instance:   Day 5, we need to commit arson in the Diner. So, what options do we have: 1) We have the man, that commited arsons in the past. Maybe we need to speak to him. No! 2) Maybe we need to lure the Diner owner outside first. No! 3) OK, maybe we try to talk to the man that feels lust for the Diner owner. No! ... khm, what must we do then? We must go to the church and randomly click on the coffin, suddenly there we see a deceased man. But we have been here before and coffin was empty. OK. We must take a photograph of the deceased and exchange it for glue. End of Day 5. And the whole game consists of similar "puzzles" - click every screen over and over again until you'll suddenly find something new. I know that developers intentionally made this game nonsensical. But nonsense in plot has nothing to do with the nonsense in gameplay.\nLet's conclude: this is absurdly illogical game and if you want to look at walkthrough every now and then, than you might try this game. Otherwise - strictly not recommended.","December 20, 2015","false","10.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","1"

It has many high quality cinematics and pretty great digitized graphics.\n\nAside from that, the subject matter of the game itself is about as disturbing, offensive, violent, and gory as you could possible imagine, and then some. This is easily the craziest game i've ever played by a country mile.\n\nIt's quite difficult, as it's very easy to dead-end your game, a staple of any good point-n-click adventure, and I ran into a situation or two that felt like I broke it. For instance, when you get the key to the broom closet, I somehow made the door unable to be opened to progress the game. She gave me a baseball bat, which I used to behead the head of a television network, so that bat may be optional, I'm not sure.\n\nIf you're a twisted ♥♥♥♥ that isn't squeamish and have a taste for disgusting distrubing subject matter, you will love this game.\n\nGot shot in the head by a crazy midget who then accidentally triggered a nuclear explosion. This game just straight up contains the craziest subject matter possibly ever seen in a game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mellow_Online1/recommended/287020/","Mellow_Online1","Mellow_Online1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mellow_Online1/","195 products in account","Im not entirely sure what to think of harvester. I got into gaming when I was just 2 years old when my dad introduced me to point and click adventure games. I enjoyed them and they drew me into gamingdue to their simple nature and controls. Point and click with a mouse. I still remember my times with the broken sword series and the monkey island series and tend to stillplay them today. I tend to play a new point and click game once in a while to return to my roots and in case you didn't figure it out already harvester is an old point and click game that was originally relaeased on the MS-DOS computer. You can tell because it runs in the DOS BOX emulator when it starts up. I first heard about harvester about 2 years ago when a youtube channel I was subscibed to (and still am) put up a "top 5 banned or censored games" list and no.1 was harvester. If u want to see the video here's the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_Kf00OyGdc Anyway I didn't pick up harvester at the time mainly because even though I've seen alot of blood and gore in video games for some reason harvester looked much worse than anything I've played. Mainly because Harvester emphasized the blood to blood and organs spewing everywhere and hadn't seen anything like this at the time. However I recently picked it up during the steam winter sale out of curiosity.\n\nWhat was it like when my curiosity was settled? eh..... That was the thing I was saying when choosing to recommend this game or not. This game felt so painstakingly average. I'll tell you about the game now\n\nYou play as a guy who wakes up in the small town of harvest ad he's suffering amnesia and starts asking around if anyone knows anything about it. People don't believ about his amnesia but it's revealed by his mother that he is said to marry a girl. He visits said girl and it's revealed that she has amnesia too, yet for some reasonshe feels a connection to our main character because he also has amnesia and as you know if someone has the same problem as us it should DEFINATELY MEAN WE SHOULD SLEEP WITH THEM. Our main character's name is Steve by the way. Yeah that's gonna be a character you're gonna remember for ages when you think back to old point and click games you've played. You have big name point and click main character names "George Stobbart" from Broken Sword "Guybrush Threepwood" from Monkey Island and "Steve" from Harvester. COULD THEY BE ANYMORE GENERIC WHEN NAMING THEIR MAIN CHARACTER!\n\nI should probably stop talking about the main character's name and tell you about the rest of the game. Harvester uses actual digitized people and put them into a fusion of CG and hand drawn back grounds. The one gripe I have with this is that I can tell that they were trying to make their game look realistic and all but these characters look really out of place. Other pointand click games did this aswell and all of them I have this gripe with. Another thing I should tell you about these character models is that they look really pixelated especially the main character's movements. The characters also act which is probably one of the worst things about harvester. THE ACTING IS AWFUL. IT'S CHEASY, IT'S BORING TO WATCH, IT'S BORING TO LISTEN TO. Another thing is that I heard some white noise at times when the actors were reading their lines and they decided not to even redo them. They try so hard to digitize actual people into the game they forgot they needed to have them act well.\n\nI wasactually quite surprised with harvest. I was expecting to go in and be hit with blood and gore from the get go. But the blood and gore only appears for people that wat it to. You can freely kill everyone liing in harvest and see the blood and guts so it mainly only appears for people that performs said acts. However I was hit with alot of blood and guts in the last hour or so of the game.\n\nThat's something else I should talk about notice the time I've put in on this game. As you cantell this is quite short for an adventure game or any game for that matter.\n\nThe thing that point and click games are known for are their puzzles. Harvester has in my opinion some of the worst puzzles I've seen in an adventure game. The answers to puzzles are basically put right infront of you and people literraly tell you what you need to do. For example near the beginning of the game you need to get an application form from the post office but the postmaster won't give you any because they're all out however he reveals there is one copy but it's the master copy which he uses to print more so STEVE can't have it. You learn the postmaster is being blackmailed by the sheriff because the postmaster burned down an oldnewspaper building and the sheriff found out about this so he has a deal with him. So steve needs to get evidence in order for him to blackmail the postmaster in  order to get the application form. There's only a deputy in the police station at the sheriff's desk as the sheriff has gone out for lunch. You find out that the deputy likes to jack off to pornographic magazines so you need to get him one. At the beginning of the game you pick up a quarter and apparently pornographic magazines are also really cheap in this game.... not that I'd know how much they are in real life. You buy the magazine give it to the deputy and goes to find a towel for his needs. You search the sheriff's desk and find the evidence, show it to the postmaster and you get the application. PUZZLE COMPLETED! The opening puzzle was so simple. It's like having to be asked to find the needle in a hastack,they throw the needle toward the haystack only for it to land a couple inches ifront of it and not in it. If you think the later puzzles improve you're wrong they don't imprvoe either. The puzzles in this game usually have a solution so simple you could do it in your everyday life. They're more like pranks the local idiot would be able to pull off. The so called puzlles are for the main character to do are to DINT A CAR, STEAL A BARBER POLE WHEN THE DOOR CAN BE OPENED BY USING A FIRE AXE U PICKED UP EARLIER AND SET FIRE TO A DINER WITH A BOXOF MATCHES! The puzzles are way too simple and could have easily been made much more difficult. I actually beat harvester in 2 sittings and that's it.\n\nThe characters seem unoriginal they seem to not have their own personality. Every single person in the game seems to be a wack job and are crazy in their own way.\n\nThe game isn't all flaws though. It has quite an interesting plot and I wanted to know what the hell was going on in harvest. Just because of the weird characters and why people were acting the way they were acting. The bad acting given off by the actors is so bad they're good. The game also let's the player play how they want to play. Want to go the linear path and see what happens? you can do that. Do you want to murder everyone in the town and see what happens?   you can also do that.\n\nHarvester is flawed, the acting is horrible, the puzzles arerushed, the people look really out of place yet it has a few prosthat seem to hold this game up from being complete sh*t\n\nPros:\n+ Good plot\n+ Suspense\n+ Not so bad cutscenes\n+ Is only as violent as the player is\n\nCons\n- Awful acting\n- Rushed puzzles\n- Short\n- Uninteresting characters\n- Characters look out of place and stiff\n\nFinal verdict: 4/10\n\nIf you like point and click games but msot of them you've played are a bit too hard and you can stomach excessive blood and gore give harvester a try otherwie I say avoid it. If u like it that's fine, it just isn't for me,but one thing I don't entirely get is that this game has had a cult following over the years. I can see why someone might like this game, but I dont think it deserves a cult following and if it does, then I fail to see how.\n\nVid rev @ 1:45:25 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29YKcwRXu5U\n\nSteam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReview","December 25, 2015","false","6.8"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","3","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedKage/recommended/287020/","RedKage","RedShadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedKage/","526 products in account","I was seriously gonna recommend this game... but I didn't.\n\nYou start in your bedroom, waking up from a tormented night. Clicking on stuff gives most of the time funny descriptions.\nLike "this plastic plant has been recently watered", "this plastic plant is dying" and many other very funny variations. This plastic plant joke will become a true inside joke throughout the game. Then you get to the living room and find a kiddo watching black and white TV. The first dialog happens when you will ask him one of the following questions:\n- Who are you?\n- Who am I?\n- Where am I?\nThat made me seriously LMFAO.\nWell, you got the picture. All the game is like this, with absolutely crazy people, funny dialogs, and incredible stupidity. The acting is bad -- on purpose. However the voices are good.\n\nThis game is a point and click adventure parody. But it's not just that. The main story will keep you playing. How comes you know about color TV when those rednecks have no idea it exists? Why don't you remember anything? Why are they... so strange?\n\nYou will encounter lots of people in this small town, from a waistless vet protecting a nuclear site, to "feminine" firemen and a teacher that loves to have a ... "goodtime" with little children... This town is completely crazy and you will definitely want to know why and how you did get dragged into this crappy situation.\n\nI had lots of fun the first day in the game. Talking to everyone, blackmailling people and stuff. However, you will get stuck pretty quick, having no idea what you should be doing. Items’ purposes are hard to figure out. I was so stuck that I had to check the walkthrough -- just to know where I was supposed to go. “Damn, yeah, I missed this tiny white pixel which was a light switch”... and so on. Very frustrating.\n\nWhat really turned me down was the end of the game, which is super lame. All was going fine, with your everyday weird routine, like giving the newspaper in the morning instead of being it given to you, chitchatting with people about commies and gay firemen, peepholing on your GF and watching her undress (eheh). Until you reach... a certain point where the story goes litteraly FUBAR. No more plot, no story, no details anymore. You will just whack you way till the end of the game... and learn the truth. Everything will be explained don't worry. But... that will be super lame.\n\nOverall this game is good for a solid 3/4 of the story. But the plot dissapoints. The story feels so unfinished, what a letdown. There are bugs too, so save often on different slots. The combat system is super  s h i t  but that's meant to be. Some FMV scenes are a bit disturbing which were the cause of the game ban in various countries. But, even though there is an excess of blood and violence, all of that is not serious. We are in a parody all right.\n\nUnfortunately, this was not enough -- for me -- to recommend this game.","May 18, 2014","false","13.1"," 25 of 59 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","25","59","0","1"

And a point and click adventure.\n\nIf it is meant as satire, it is a bad satire. It lacks any depth or coherence. It is just a bunch of as much randomness and insanity as possible without any central theme whatsoever. Everything that happens is just a bad excuse of a real story.\n\nIf it is meant seriously on the other hand, it is just badly realised crap. An ugly looking crap with bad controls and a stupid story telling (If you want to call it like that). The whole stupid violence and crackbrained efforts to create disgust are simply plain dull. It may be controversial, it apparently was when it has been published, but I can’t see anything that really provokes me. It is a childish Fantasising about violence without anything special about it. Any symbolism, metaphorical reference or any other medium of meaning is just soulless and meaningless. And I can’t ignore that, because there is nothing else to focus: No remarkable gameplay, no special look or art style, no fun in playing this imbalanced mess.\n\nAnd that disappoints me very much. From Minute one I saw and I waited, fascinated from the dark (humorous) world full of quirkiness to actually deliver something. But anything that could have created some meaning in this pile of randomness came to nothing. All this references to: Atomic Weapons, religious extremism, bigotry, child abuse and murder, homophobia, the somehow creepy societies in small towns, peversion ... – all this is right there, ready to create meaning or at least a story. But the game just throws it in your face and then goes on never minding it again. There is nothing here. At all. I would call it neither mysterious nor messed up.\n\n","June 25, 2015","false","6.0"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","0"

Now, Harvester's writing is it's strongest point. It doesn't seem like much at first, but it quickly draws you in and keeps you playing, no matter how horrific it gets.\n\nBasically, you play as a plaid-shirted kidder named Steve. Steve wakes up one morning with amnesia in a strange town called Harvest. The residents of the town all seem very... off, and a lot of aspects of the town itself are very strange, too. The only other sane person in the town is Steve's apparent fiance, Stephanie, who also happens to have amnesia. Now the kicker is that the town seems to be controlled by a strange group called the Order of the Harvest Moon. Steve can't get a good answer as to who they are, but all he knows is that he has to join their ranks and enter their building, the Lodge, before Sunday or else he'll have to partake in the "Blood Drive," which he knows damn well isn't what it sounds like. During the Order initiation, Steve is on a bunch of strange tasks, from scratching Mr. Johnson's Tucker to burning down DNA's Edna's Diner, in a subversion of the typical 'fetch quests make everyone happy' trope. Steve is becoming a monster, but he doesn't care, and neither do you. You both need to find out just what's up with this town, what's in the Lodge, and how the Order seems to rule over Harvest. You don't care that you've just done unspeakable things to the residents of Harvest, you need to get into the Lodge. And once you finally get into the lodge, you're still not even close to being done. The Lodge is when things start to get really ♥♥♥♥ed up. That's why the game is so great. It forces you to keep playing. You can't stop because you need to know the answers. I'm not going to spoil the ending, but I will tell you that the twist is absolutely amazing.\n\nThe game is pretty mediocre in terms of the graphics and combat (yes, there's combat in this game. I'll get to that) though. The digitized graphics don't hold up today, though the FMVs are still pretty creepy. Old horror FMVs seem to have an Uncanny Valley feel going for them. I like it. The voice acting is pretty bad too, though in a good way.\n\nNow you're probably wondering what I meant about combat. Well, this game has a combat system. I know, pretty weird for a point-and-click game, right? But yeah, the combat system is ♥♥♥♥. It's okay during the town parts, as you don't need to fight anyone that often, but the Lodge part is very combat-oriented, so good have fun mashing your right-click for a third of the game.\n\nBut graphics and combat aside, Harvester is a fantastic game that I highly recommend, as long as you don't have a weak stomach.","July 20, 2014","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/5NATCH/recommended/287020/","5NATCH","mmm!5NATCH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/5NATCH/","513 products in account","Harvester is a classic point and click adventure game originally released in the mid 90s. upon purchase on steam, It comes with a journal article basically stating stuff about violence in video games. So you can expect an epicly gorey and surreal adventure. You'll want to try and explore every area of the game and you'll be surprised or shocked by some of the stuff you'll see.\n\nIf you remember the classic point and click adventure games, then you'd already know the fundamentals of playing this game. Click on things, Pick up items, Heavy dialog from various NPCs, Work out cryptic puzzles, Think about using an FAQ. All those natrual moments of point and click adventures will come to you. So if that thrills you, This is a title to pick up. If you need an extra push on the decision... here's the story.\n\nThe beauty of this game is basically waking up not knowing a single thing. You dont know where you are, who you are, or what you are meant to do. and after briefly talking to various people in the town, You find out you have amnesia. As you discover parts about yourself, you also learn the town you are in is not exactly like other towns. You have your average buildings like Schools, Police station, General store but the largest building in the centre of the town is The Lodge. No one in town knows whats inside but you'll need to gain access to it. If you manage to succeed, You might be lucky to actually understand what the whole story of this game is.\n\nAs for the violence and gore? Well there's definately a lot of that. There was several settings and scenarios that may upset some people and if I could admit, there was one particular scene I came across which even I was shocked by. The FMV movies have some porno-intro style acting but it gives the game a unique touch.\n\nIt might feel dated now, but the story and the enviroment you are traveling through. It feels like a surreal bad dream and for some reason, when things are so creepy or unusual we cant help but be curious to get more. So I'd say if you can get this game, Grab it.\n\n\n\n\n","April 20, 2015","true","23.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Warning, if you cannot take racism, dissent towards firemen, and much much worse things (really if you have any form of PTSD you should probably stay far away), this game is not for you.

You have a strange society and some kind of wisdom which promises you all the answers. Dialogues are believable, seems to be written by someone that actually knows how to do that (a fact that is not obvious in modern P&C games, where talking heads tells you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t)\nI like how this game presents some human instincts like a jealousy.\nHarvester is still actual when we are talking about media and things like food production. Sometimes it seems to be pretensious but for the story of a young guy it`s acceptable.\nIf you want to buy an adventure game and have a dilema between Harvester and a new 3d Broken Sword, choose a Harvester. And if you have to choose between Harvester and one of these modern pseudo artistic - adventure maker based - ♥♥♥♥, choose Harvester.\nBut remember: Do not overdose FMV games. It hurts your brain.

This is highly addictive, entertaining and intelligent title, but has sense of humour so extremely dark and disturbing that it won't go without psychical impact on anyone who is not totally socio- or psychopath.\n\nThe only real downside of this title is that it is painfully difficult to complete without solution due to illogical nature and time-base of some puzzles. Maybe I am not an experienced adventure games player, but for me the puzzles got more and more abstract and frustrating toward the end and actually only the few first ones made sense for me so I could solve them without struggle.\n\nExcept of above, everything else: dialogues, video cut-scenes, script, ideas - is excellent here. I could not stop playing it until I finished and just after that I wanted to start again.

Strange feelings like I was first realised that women uses a thing like a vibrator (my childchood times, I was asking mysefl If a things like that create a world when there`s no need for males).\n\nBut stick to the facts:\n\nWorld of Harvester is well build. You have a strange society and some kind of wisdom which promises you all the answers. Dialogues are believable, seems to be written by someone that actually knows how to do that (a fact that is not obvious in modern P&C games, where talking heads tells you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t)\nI like how this game presents some human instincts like a jealousy.\nHarvester is still actual when we are talking about media and things like food production. Sometimes it seems to be pretensious but for the story of a young guy it`s acceptable.\nIf you want to buy an adventure game and have a dilema between Harvester and a new 3d Broken Sword, choose a Harvester. And if you have to choose between Harvester and one of these modern pseudo artistic - adventure maker based - ♥♥♥♥, choose Harvester.\nBut remember: Do not overdose FMV games. It hurts your brain.

So conceptually this game is great. Unfortunately, beyond the writing and directing the game starts to fall apart with lots of bugs and possibly the worst combat system ever devised. Every weapon has a different range and firing speed, but it always winds up being a speed-click contest regardless; you can also aim upward, middle, or downward but this seems to be pointless. It's a shame, because this game was delayed two years for the programming alone, which seems to have done more harm to the project than good.\n\nIn short, this game didn't get the budget it deserved. The good news is, it's only the second half where the bugs become apparent and only in certain places. The game is still awesome and replayable.

Actually the trend of juvenile violence relating to video games has experienced a downward trend since the formation of the ESRB in 1994, so the premise is no longer true (and here in 2014 we can laugh about it). But the overall message is obscured by the game. Its only concern is to get you to play "minor pranks" that will ultimately turn Steve into a serial killer. As the game goes on, it gets more and more ridiculous. The newspaper boy has a pistol that he'll shoot you with if you don't put the newspaper outside (the game even acknowledges the ridiculousness of that), Loomis the sheriff's deputy is beaten with a newspaper like a dog by the sherriff if he catches him beating his meat in a jail cell, a teacher actually beats a child's head in with a baseball bat for asking a question during a nuclear bomb drill, the firefighters are all gay and drive a pink fire truck. The list goes on and on. It was rather nostalgic to play an old point and click style adventure game, but there are far better ones. That's not to say this one is easy, the graphics are so pixellated sometimes it's hard to tell what's what. A grey rectangle in the distance is a drawer that you need to open to get a screwdriver out of. I'd recommend playing this only to see the sheer ridiculousness of the game.","September 7, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
