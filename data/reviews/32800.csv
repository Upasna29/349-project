The two other characters that you did not choose become AI and help you on your journey. You get to explore Rivendell, Brill, and many more and talk to some of the Fellowship, but your journey is not with them, instead you head north towards the Grey Mountains to fight this game's antagonist, Agandaur.\n\nThe game is fairly short, but there is a lot of replay value. You can play through the story as another character and find secrets that you couldn't with any of the other characters. Once you beat a difficulty, you unlock the next one and you can continue to level and gather further upgrades.\n\nThe scenery is very beautiful but the levels are as linear as ever. Nothing is destructable with the exception of barrels and boxes and a few certain locations where you have to blow through a door.\n\nThe gameplay is decent. It's a basic hack and slash with various ranged attacks depending on the character. As you level up, you can put skills into your talent tree and unlock a few more skills on your action bar. The cooldowns are lengthy enough to keep you hacking and slashing until you get to unleash your abilities again.\n\nI would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys the lore or Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. I learned a few things I never knew and there are a couple easter eggs.\n\nI got this game for $1 dollar during the bundle and I would NOT recommend you buy this at $19.99. There are a TON of bugs. There is a brightness bug during some of the levels. Side Quests sometimes disapear. Your saves can get deleted.\n\nSome game mechanism are poor as well. The hit box on all the characters are huge. You can shoot an arrow to the left of them and they still get hit. When you want to squeeze past your friend, you get stuck by invisible barriers. The barriers are everywhere as well.\n\nWORST OF ALL...the game is abandoned. The ownership of the game was sold and then the game was abandon. No more patches and no more support.\n\nWait for a sale and see if you can get this cheap.","November 25, 2013","true","30.3"," 291 of 317 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","291","317","0","0"

If you have two friends you often play games with, then you should definitely check this one out. It's best played like that, with this game only benefiting you from playing co-op. Each character has their own secrets which can open up areas that hide loot, and each character has a race skill which can help the other characters out. The combat is very satisfying, because you can pull off some awesome dismemberments and decapitations, and even do Fellowship strikes or kills when all characters are attacking the same enemy.\n\nAt first sight it looks like it offers the typical character selection, being a Mage, a Warrior and a Ranger. But none of these characters HAVE to be played like they usually are. I played as the Ranger, and you would assume he would mainly use his bow in combat. I really only did when there were enemies you could only reach with ranged attacks. The game gave me the option to use two-handed weapons, dual wield two one-handed weapons, or use a one-handed weapon in combination with a shield too. There were plenty of skills which would increase my effectiveness with either of these weapon combinations, as well as skills which would give me new archery abilities or give specific bonuses to me using my race skill.\n\nI feel like this game is a nice combination between an action-based hack-and-slash game, with the looting system of an Action RPG/Dungeon Crawler, and a story and setting which fit right into the LOTR series. I'm not saying the story is interesting enough to make every LOTR fan play this game, but it's also not ruining any part of the lore. It might just be a little more interesting for someone who likes the LOTR story than for someone who doesn't care for it at all.","July 15, 2014","true","26.0"," 137 of 150 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","137","150","0","0"

The game is best played casually a few hours at the time, If you play it that way, and you're a fan, the game will probably keep you entertained all the way through and has a lot going for it when it comes to the story and locations.\n\nIf you're not interested in the Lord of the Rings world, and come just for the action RPG, you'll probably find the game lacking, especially if you put 3-4 or more hours in to the game each go, then the game will probably feel quite repetitive.\n\nThe game tells a story of three heroes (man, dwarf, elf) indirectly helping the fellowship during the LotR story. You run in to quite a few characters from the books/movies, and visit familiar locations as Bree and Rivendell. The locations in this game generally look great, and all the characters has quite a lot to say, so the story builds up well with lots of background information available if you like to listen to conversation.\n\nThe main part of the game has you battling mostly orcs in a third person action RPG style. The combat style doesn't differ much through the game, you can select any of the three characters (but switching between them is only allowed upon clearing a section of the current chapter, or after visiting towns, and is a bit clunky), use a light or heavy attack, ranged attacks and magic/skills. You level up and unlock/improve skills and get better gear/other loot that improve stats, but the gameplay doesn't change that much. You're still hacking/shooting at orcs most of the time.\n\nI really enjoyed the combat, and the levelling/loot was enough to keep me interested all the way through, and combat is fun. Sometimes after getting the enemy HP down enough you get a prompt to use a heavy attack for a limb severing finish that for me never got old. Just as satisfying every time.\n\nThe game has some nice boss battles as well, and every chapter has a few events that mixes things up.\n\nThe game also supports online co op (up to 3 players in total). Unfortunately, I haven't been able to try this, but I can image this game can be lots of fun with 1-2 friends.\n\nAs for the glitches: At the final chapter, there was a game breaking glitch, for some reason when navigating the tunnels the game got really choppy and crashed when the frame rate got too low. Apparently a common problem, and the solution was to set the graphics to minimum and get through that section with as little on screen as possible (aiming at the floor while moving helped). When out of the tunnels, restart the game and everything is well again.\n\nUpdate: Apparently the problem is AMD related and another way of fixing it is by installing the 12.6  version of AMD Catalyst, Click for a guide.\n\nI enjoyed the game and will do a "New game+" some day.","December 27, 2014","true","16.7"," 114 of 120 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","114","120","8","0"

Tolkien but with three characters specifically created for the game as their story runs parallel to the plot of the original books and films, often intersecting at various pivotal points in the saga as they play their part in winning the war against Sauron.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=338706253\nThe story on display actually turns out to be a rather good and is very well written and fits quite naturally into the magical world created for the series by Tolkien himself. The game is impeccably voiced with a talented voice cast that do the script and the characters just the right amount of justice. Booting up the game you will have the choice of one of three characters - the dwarf Farin, the ranger Eradan or the mage Andriel - placing you immediately into the believable world that is Middle-earth so expertly brought to life recently by Peter Jackson in his Lord of the Rings Trilogy. The game even ensures that key characters almost resemble their film counterparts so as to tie in with the trilogy. It's a pity that they could not get the voice actors to reprise their roles digitally but I can only imagine getting the likes of Sir Ian, Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchet would have cost a pretty penny, so whilst it does sound a bit odd to have these characters voiced by different actors they do a sterling job nonetheless.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=338705270\nWar in the North plays out like any traditional hack n' slash title on the market and offers players the chance to co-op with all three major characters. Playing this in co-op, both myself and my co-op partner found it to be a blast. It's for the most part well made and it looks rather good. Some have complained about imbalances between the three main protagonists (something that doesn't really bother me in the slightest and was certainly only marginally noticeable) and I have heard that the game repeatedly crashes on AMD hardware so be warned about this one if you plan on picking this up. There are also some game crunching bugs on display that sometimes made us have to restart a section because one of us either got locked out an area or were blocked by some invisible wall. Thankfully it was not large swathes of the game we needed to repeat before continuing with the journey.\n\nI had a rather enjoyable time with this release from Snowblind Studios which echo's their previous effort , Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance, to perfection. The game is also the perfect length for a game of this nature never outstaying its welcome either by running at a pert 14 hrs before coming to an end. I highly recommend you get some friends in on the action with this one as it can be a lot of fun with the right mates. I found Lord of the Rings: War in the North to be an entertaining diversion and whilst it certainly was never meant to win any awards, what it does - it does admirably well and I found myself actually having a lot of fun with it. Worth picking up and playing by all fans of Lord of the Rings or hack n' slash games in general.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","May 23, 2014","true","13.6"," 165 of 192 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","165","192","0","5"

A worth side-story? Mh. Let's see.\nIn "LotR: War in the North" you will play as a dwarf, a ranger or an elf. The events play parallel to the main story of LotR, so you will see some known faces. The story is simple: Sauron wants to rule "middle-earth" (as far as we know from the movies/books). One of his leaders Agandúar (?) is stationed in north of "middle-earth" (no sh*t) and you have to stop him. So you play behind the scenes.

This game was designed as a multiplayer experience, so you should play with a friend if you can, if not prepare yourself to constant variations is gameplay as you'll have to change characters more often than not. In the end this was not a setback, as each has a slightly different play style so changing characters (ranger, elf, dwarf) proved to be varied and amusing.\n\nThis game is first and foremost aimed at Lord of the Rings / Tolkien fans. If you count yourself among those, you'll be satisfied. I played this game as I was reading The Silmarillion again which proved to be a good choice as the story is not focused on the main events at the end of the Third Age but on the fight against the forces of Sauron in the north of Middle Earth. Don't expect Bethesda or Bioware levels of lore in this game, just relax, enjoy the story and focus on what this game does best - combat.\n\nThe fights are intense, combos are easy to execute and enemies' limbs fly all over as you chop Orc after Orc.

The combat mechanics work quite well, the game looks and performs reasonably decent for its age, and the option for co-op adds to the reasons why you should try it out. However, its downfall ultimately lays in the boring story and the method in which it progresses you through the game.\n\nEssentially, you are moving a short distance from area (arena) to area, where the game proceeds to shut you into a zone and begins to spawn wave after wave of enemies for you to defeat. Only once you have cleared these waves will the area "unlock" again to allow you to move on. This is used constantly as the games main progression mechanic and quickly becomes dull and tedious. For the first hour or two this can be overlooked, but once you are a few hours into the game and realise it is just more of the same, monotony quickly robs you of any desire to continue playing.\n\nAdd in a few annoying limitations, such a a lack of screen resolutions and "always on" voice chat that cannot be disabled, and it becomes very hard to recommend War in the North, unless you are looking for a mindless hack and slash game to play with two friends.","May 14","false","5.7"," 112 of 147 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","112","147","4","0"

But as it turns out, it was not as bad as everyone says. It's a pretty - albeit shallow, linear and generic -  action game that was a welcome change after the huge open-world of Skyrim.\n\nI think one problem people had with this game is that it was originally advertised as an RPG. This game is anything but; it's a third-person melee fighter in the vein of Hexen or Dark Messiah. Yes, there are some rudimentary RPG elements (quests, stats) but at its core "War In The North" is pure action. Although the graphics aren't jaw-dropping, it does boast a number of spectacular vistas. The characters are generic but appealing nonetheless, and the story likewise.\n\nIt does lack in variety, however; your avatars only have a limited moveset and you'll be fighting off the same handful of monsters throughout the entire game. The levels are more varied, but are incredibly linear and despite some impressive set-pieces nothing you haven't seen before. This definitely limits its re-playability, even with the co-op mode, but as a change of pace from larger games it was still a welcome experience.\n","November 25, 2013","true","17.1"," 70 of 86 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","70","86","0","0"

Let me say this right away, I haven't had so much fun in a LOTR game since LOTR: Return of the King on the Xbox. War in the North is basicly an Action RPG, it reminded of Dragon Age at some times gameplay wise. You can play with one of 3 characters, Eradan (Man) which is the Ranger class, Farin (Dwarf) which is the Champion class and Andriel (Elf) wich is a Lore Master (mage). When you level up you can upgrade each one of your stats (stamina, will, strengh, dexterity etc.) and you can also level up a skill which is either passive or active and you use it during combat. Storywise the game takes place on the North while the Fellowship make their way to Mordor. The game plays really well ( I did found it easier to play with a 360 controller though), the combat is satisfying yet I felt like it was somewhat simple with a lack of combos and variety to it. You also have an inventory to store your items and your loot, which I don't know if it's random, and you can sell the stuff you don't want at a store or certain "checkpoints" that appear on each level. Two things I really like about LOTR: War in the North is that the game rewards exploration, by gaining access to secret areas and finding extra gear to either sell or equip, the other thing I also liked is the character design and the dialogue system. Basicly the dialogue system works like in Mass Effect, Dragon Age and KOTOR, I don't know if this was made on the Bioware dialogue engine though. Eitherways, either if you're a fan of the LOTR world or not it is certain that this is still a very good game and that you don't need to be a fan of LOTR to enjoy it, it's satisfying, it's fun and the plot is very engaging, you can't go wrong with this one, play it!","December 15, 2013","true","14.3"," 61 of 73 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","61","73","0","1"

All of the familiar characteristics of the action-RPG genre are here, from shops and loot to blacksmiths that repair weakened or busted weaponry; as well as some combo-based swordplay.War in the North is all about action, and the action starts when you pick one of the three characters.  No, you can’t pick any of the actual LOTR characters.  You’re stuck with these relatively generic goofballs, doing relatively generic things in a generic fantasy world populated by generic quest givers. Several builds exist for each character though, and you can even build the wizard in melee combat and kick ♥♥♥ surprisingly.  Other than her, you’ve got your typical LOTR ranger and warlord archetypes to play as for sword and bow combat. The control scheme doesn’t really lend that well to a keyboard and mouse, so I highly recommend making the investment for a controller if you don’t have one already. With a completely forgettable character lineup and story that only serves to get in the way or set up the next hub/killing field, it’s been a long time since I ran into a hack and slash that I really never feel like loading up again after putting down.The highlight of the game, as every LOTR game should have a great soundtrack and voice acting to back it up, and this delivers. While the actual context of the story is pretty pathetic, the production values are high enough to keep you listening rather than skipping cutscenes.Games graphics are also rather good.

The game takes place in Middle-earth, the same timeline as the fellowship of the ring, except you're not going to be with the fellowship here, not even you're going to join the battle of Helm's Deep or the Siege of Minas Tirith. You have your own battle here in the northern part of Middle-earth. You will be able to explore Rivendell or you may call it Imladris, the town of Bree, Mirkwood and more. You can choose 3 different characters, each from different race, different abilities and different secrets to found throughout the game. Choose Eradan, a human rangers from Dunedain, Andriel, an elf lore-master from Imladris or Farin, a dwarf from Erebor. Any characters you choose, the rest will become your AI companion.\n\nThe game has good and decent gameplay. It's basic hack and slash game but each characters can also use different ranged attack such as crossbow. The story of the game is linear which makes the level also very linear. Items are vary in this game, and items with better quality can be found as the characters level progress and playing more harder difficulty. Once you beat a difficulty, you can continue playing from the start point on the next difficulty level but retaining your characters level and items. You can also play cooperative with your friends here.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: War in the North has good graphics. Each level and stages in the game have great detail on the environment, which makes Rivendell have really beautiful scenery and the enemy castle a very bad place to see. Animation is also good, though sometimes there is a small animation glitch when an orcs dies.\n\nBut I also will tell you that this game has downside too. Unfixed bugs and glitches are common here, you may see a sword thrown up without reason, the AI companion is somewhat foolish too, using ability when their foe is already dead, or sometimes they even will become your problem. The acting is also not that good, even the voice acting too. But this game is still recommended from me.\n\n+ Gameplay\n+ Cooperative\n+ Storyline\n+ Graphics\n+ Replayable\n\n- Bad AI\n- Bugs\n- Glitches\n\nRating 8/10","February 13, 2014","true","32.0"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","41","47","0","0"

Tolkien. This game is a piece of art and it should be treated as much. It's price is more than reasonable for its long story and content and those who were unable to have access to the 4 books, might find this game for informative and interesting than they thought. Though the gameplay itself is not bad, I will give cons to this game because of the following 3 : 1. Very small lvl cap, in other words you cant max out your character ( dont worry you can buy respec item ;) ). 2. sudden difficulty changes, for example there is one sequence where you have to go from agile goblins and orc, to Uruk and Trolls. 3. No actual need for skills, yes you may fall in battle and yes you may get grabbed by that troll, but dont worry, only if the entire team falls before one gets up you may be able to lose, also in addition to that if you fill your pocket and sell whatever you dont want, you can get extremely good equipment, which will turn current, suppossed to be, strong enemies into childs' play.\nAlthough this game is good and if you are a fan of Hobbit or Lord of the  Rings you might find it interesting and even sometimes exciting.

Some people say it gets boring after a while as the whole game is the same (to slice orcs) Which gets true, But i always seem to go back and play it again in a few weeks. The combat is great, and uses a variety of skills (depending if your Man,Elf or Dwarf) to defeat Agandaurs minions. The only other problem i had with this game was it is too short, There are about 8 levels (Including Fornost,Barrow Downs, Ettermoors, Gundabad, Mirkwood, Uglost Lair, Nordinbad and Carn Dum) This roughly takes about 15-25 hours to complete. Of course, you then play it at a harder difficulty afterwards and find new armour,weapons etc. Even though the game is fasirly short I still highly recommend it as it is one of my faviourite games, and is very fun to play.","January 1, 2015","true","45.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I wish I had scrolled down the reviews more to have seen warnings about ATI cards. It started out as a pretty great co-op game, with slightly jaded graphics and not top level game mechanics, but still playable and enjoyable.\n\nThen chapter 2 hit, and it all went to hell in barrow downs. Missing textures, random disconnects and system crashes at various intervals, especially in the middle of hard fights - problems either for you or friends connected to your game. The first few were just a minor annoyance because the game was quite fun but, when it kept happening, my friends and I just had to give up in frustration. It was a sad thing too, because the game is pretty addictive.\n\nThe biggest annoyance for me is how the game's minimum requirements actually state that ATI cards older than those from 2006 will run this game, and how that is basically untrue after the first chapter. I begin wonder if I can get my money back just for that partially false statement.\n\nI don't want to go through the trouble of listing my system specs, but it runs anything recent like DA:I or FC4 on ultra without issues.

Since there aren't any PROs, I'll just go ahead and list the CONs.\n\n- Pointless story which is completely irrelevant to the LOTR movies/books.\n- Terrible gameplay. To sum it up in one word: REPETITIVE. Expect to grind through the same mobs of enemies and reused bosses for the 10 hour length of the game.\n- Awful dialogue and voice acting. Hearing the same cheesy one-liners from the characters over and over again drove me crazy.\n- The graphics for this game are totally outdated; even for a game that was released in 2011. (Playing on ultra settings, I saw no difference between the visuals in this game and the visuals in LOTR: Return of the King on the ♥♥♥♥ing Gamecube.)\n- Bad UI and inventory management. This makes the process of navigating menu's and matchmaking incredibly painful.\n- Poor level design. Each chapter is basically a rinse-and-repeat. (Field, Cave, Building. THIS x INFINITE.)\n\nUnfixed Problems/Bugs/Glitches:\n- InGame mic voice chat. It allows players' mics to constantly be open and there's no way to disable it. (A complete bummer for some people that use external VOIP software such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo.)\n- Black screens and game crashes. Expect to replay entire segments of the game because of this. (These issues are even worse for AMD users.)\n- Issues with savedata.\n\nThis game seems nothing more than a cash-grab and is a complete disappointment for true LOTR fans.\nPlease save your money.

The point when you meet few of the characters from the original movies is cool.

Then I exit the host while I was at Rivendell and from there on I was at Chapter 3.

It really feels like a 3d version of Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance 1 and 2, which makes sense as I think some of the same developers were involved.  The combat is fairly good and would most likely be a blast playing with 2 other friends (I've only been playing solo at this point).  This game is well worth the $5 I paid.  I would say it would be worth buying even at $20.\n\nI'm very fussy with the games I spend my time on, and I can say that LOTRWITN has been enjoyable and I look forward to playing through the campaign a few more times at different difficulty levels.","October 12, 2014","true","11.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ugandanwasteland/recommended/32800/","ugandanwasteland","Genital Holocaust","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ugandanwasteland/","112 products in account","Just got through the campaign in nine hours - and that's WITH revisiting some areas to finish a couple of side quests.  That being said, that's how much time you're going to spend on a single play-through.  If you're going to do a run with all three characters, and on both normal and heroic difficulties, you're looking at 50 to 60 hours of semi-original gameplay.  Coop is something I'd like to do sometime.  Maybe that'll add another 20 hours.\n\nHave you guys ever played Lord of the Rings: Third Age?  This feels like that game if it were shorter and didn't have turn-based combat.\n\nReally quickly, I'm going to give a run-down of what I definitely do and do not like - spoilers ahead.\n\nI liked the world: The devs of this game did an absolutely outstanding job of creating their world, however stunted it may be in certain areas.  Rivendell and Nordinbad were good examples due to how outstanding the architecture was, but the best area for me was the Barrow-downs.  They NAILED the atmosphere for that area, and looking out at all the outstanding crags and jagged rocks planted in the rolling green hills gave me chills.  Inside Gundabad was epic as well, being able to look across the void and see all these different things going on.\n\nI like the weapon system: There are a bunch of weapons in the game: hand-axes, battleaxes, short swords, long swords, hammers, staffs.  You can dual-wield one-handed weapons after unlocking a specific perk thing.  While I've only played as the Ranger, there was still a great deal that I could toy with.  It seems to be about finding your style, but there's also moving between dual-wielding and broadsword wielding in order to balance damage and speed.  Also, weapons break down after time and need to be repaired by a forger.\n\nSimilarly, I like the equipment system:  Giving yourself the best armor while looking for repairs on what's about to break.\n\nI like how weapons and equipments can be imbued with properties: You know, stuff like ice damage, fire damage, shock damage.  Boosts to strength, stamina, health, power.  Same kind of gimmick from Skyrim, but executed well here.  Some equipment/weapons do not have slots - others have multiple.   Fun figuring out what to trade off - damage or health?\n\nI like the checkpoints: almost every level will have checkpoints where you can sell your loot, buy very basic things like weak armor and potions, and you can return to the last safe area (Bree, Rivendell, Nordinbad).  Good for getting out if you need and dumping inventory.\n\nI'm conflicted on the lore.  I like what it tries to do, especially regarding fallen Dunedain cities and Carn Dum and the dwarves, but it comes off as something that these three characters should not be able to rise up against.  Aragorn wants you to defeat Sauron's right hand man, like no big deal champ thanks for the help?  Oh wow check out these sick dwarves taking out the whole of Mt. Gundabad with this awesome secret weapon?  That's literally Deus ex Machina.\n\nI'm conflicted on the combat.  It's monotonous, but the perk(???) system makes it a bit interesting.  Once again, that's not something I've fully explored, but it breaks the monotony of LMB spam and the RMB coup-de-grace.\n\nThe only real hate I have is for a Mannish faction that follows Agandaur.  The grunts of this Mannish faction are overpowered.  Their swords extend beyond what their model shows, and they attack FAST.  They do not get knocked back.  Don't expect an easy one-up over these guys.  Spam your special attacks and ranged.  Or the devs can fix these guys, whatever.\n\nCan't think of anything else that I really do hate.  As a Tolkien fan who wanted more but knew this wasn't canon at all, I give this a 7/10 because I got it on sale.  Do not get this at full price.\n\n","May 25","true","9.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

We discovered something: this game is a must in co-op! We had loads of fun and we were frustrated more than once when we couldn’t kill a boss or troll. But in the end we got through and concluded that this game is more than awesome!! On the other hand we were let down by the final battle, which was simply tooooooo easy, since we had more difficulty defeating the first boss in the game.\n\nTHE STORY: We were pleasantly surprised by the fact that the story is interwoven with the actual storyline of LOTR. You even come across characters as Aragorn, Gandalf, Lord Elrond, Legolas and Gloin (known from the Hobbit-trilogy) and even Frodo and Bilbo Baggins. You follow three companions (Eradan, Andriel and Farin) on their quest to defeat a minion of the dark lord Sauron. On their way they make several friends and stops in the north of Middle Earth.\n\nGRAPHICS: Not bad at all for a game that is already 4 years old. We saw a fair amount of detail on armours, buildings and the like and didn’t realise we were playing such an old game.\n\nINTERFACE: Convenient use of hotkeys and a useful minimap! The inventory was a little off, since you had very limited space and images for additional and trivial objects in the world of Middle Earth.\n\nGAMEPLAY: We found it very useful that you could see the name of your friends on screen even if they were in an entirely different place/room. A very useful feature of the game is that you have the option to exchange items with other players that are only suitable for that particular race. Conveniently enough there were several sell/buy/return to civilisation-points.\n\n- For the Ranger: Very smooth movement of the character during a fight and one of the current reviewers enjoyed the swordplay a little too much at times. We liked the convenient switch between two-handed, one-handed, dual wielding and bow very useful. And, contrary to some other RPG’s,  the realism of being attacked whilst you are looting or switching weapons was very satisfactory to us! We loved the critical, brutal, legendary, etc. strikes with the swords and headshots with the bow too. They lead to some pretty funny ways of dying! We would’ve loved an alternative attack with hotkey ‘2’ while using a two-handed sort, but that could just be because we didn’t unlock every skill in the skill tree. Conclusion; Eradan was a great ranger.\n- For the Lore-master: Andriel has some great abilities to use in combat, as a supportive mage. For example, she can conjure a magical shield that can protect you against arrows and magical blasts. She also can use her staff as a melee weapon, that is actually quite strong. Because of her Elven ancestry, Andriel can use herbs to fabricate potions to support herself or her companions. This can be decisive at some points in the game.\n- For the Champion: Not applicable (yet), but Farin is awesome!! He got us out of trouble more than once…more like a thousand times…LOL.\n\nALSO FUN;\n- You can use your Eagle friend to do all the heavy work for you.\n- You meet a dragon; Which seems to be very popular amongst gamers.\n- Turrets!\n\nOverall conclusion: 'The Lord of the Rings - War in the North' is a must have if you are a fan of the LOTR, RPG and/or co-op gaming, with a bit of hack & slash in it. We had hours and hours of fun (and yet more to come) and we didn't get bored with the storyline once, even though all those trolls were a pain. Me and my friend decided that we definitely are going to play this game a few times each year... *Totally not addicted*\n\n\nEnjoy the game!","April 29, 2015","true","42.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It also uses characters-model from the movies...but...it's a totally different story. Kind of. In the south, war breaks between the Dark Lord Sauron and the free people of Middle Earth, as shown in the movies/books. But the game shows a "hidden" story: a fellowship composed of Eradan, a Dunedáin (man), Farin, a dwarf and Andriel, a she-elf. They too, embark in a journey to fight for the north of Middle Earth, at the same time of the LOTR trilogy battles in the south. It's an interesting idea and the plot develops really well. With the presence of beloved characters that will make a LOTR fan smile, a decent villain and some good character development for Beleram, an Eagle that helps in the journey, i liked the story. The ending is also epic and amazing with a challenging boss fight. Talking about boss fights, the game have a lot of them and they're all pretty good. The game is challenging even in the lowest difficult (normal) because of tough enemeis in high quantities. Sometimes is frustrating because of your companions AI when you die in combat, but it's pretty rewarding, as this game is about loot and there is a lot of it. You can choose one of the three characters to play, and all of them have unique skills to upgrade and purchase, that's real nice. Also they have unique abilities and usable weapons, making the variation of playing with each one of them unique. You can even play online, whick makes the game a lot more enjoyable. But while playing offline, the companions AI is pretty bad, and sometimes you die just because they messed up while trying to ressurect you. It's frustrating. The graphics are outdated, and the facial animations are bad, but the scenarios are really awesome. The combat is very cool with all aplicable skills and upgrades, use of potions and weapons, inclding ranged weapons. But it gets too repetitive. The whole game is a bit repetitive, there is no puzzles, just go and kill a thousand enemies, proceed, then do it again. It may have RPG elements, but it's pretty linear besides the fact you can travel to some places, and challenge maps in scenarios from LOTR trilogy. There is dialog system too, which have zero impact on the story and only serves to know more about events/begin side quests. There is some side quests and some of them are decent, but there is only a few. The soundtrack, as expected, is awesome and have some beautiful melodies and epic combat tracks. You can call for Beleram support, which is awesome and helps a lot. The game length is good for an action game and you can replay in higher levels of difficult with the same weapons and equipment (there is armor and other stuff in good quantity). Kind of new game+, adding replay value because you can use other characters. You can swap characters during the campaign by only going back to menu or at certain points, and giving them items mean nothing, they don't use them and you should switch at least one time to up their skills and equip the loot they found because those dumbasses don't do anything alone. The game have some bugs too, as usual.\n\n\n+Replayability\n+Boss Battles\n+Epic ending\n+Decent plot\n+Beautiful scenarios\n+Lots of weapons, armors, skills, upgrades\n+Secrets and loot\n+Good characters\n+Absolutely epic ending sequence and boss fight\n+A few sidequests\n+LOTR Trilogy characters!\n+Lots of enemies types\n+Challenging and cool combat\n+Epic soundtrack\n+Unique characters skills, weapons\n+Challenge maps\n+Co-op\n+Eagle support\n\n-Some bugs\n-Stupid and bad AI\n-Outdated graphics and poor facial animations\n-Very repetitive\n-Horrid UI\n-Dialog does not impact nothing in the story\n-Very linear\n-Sometimes frustrating\n-Boring sometimes\n\n\nA decent Middle-Earth tale with some good inspiration on it, but nothing impressive.\n7,5/10","January 5","true","24.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

You get to play as either Eradan the ranger, Andriel the lore-master, or Farin the champion, to thwat the plans of Sauron's commander, Agandaur. While exploring vast landscape from the Shire, to Grey Mountains, and Mirkwood, you get to meet members from the fellowship of the rings, side characters such as Radagast the Brown, and even a mighty dragon. If you've played LOTR: the Third Age, the narrative of this game is fairly similiar.\n\nGameplay: the 3 aspects of a good RPG are present in this game, namely - statpoints, skilltree, and itemization. As there are limited points and inventory space to go around, decisions must be made into how your character is created. While the diversity of types of character is definitely limited, it is enough to keep you entertained for a 20-50hrs long game.\n\nUnlike The Third Age, this game is a action based RPG and each 'encounter' with orcs requires some sort of finesse to defeat them. However, the game is not too hard, and it actually becomes easier as you unlock the heroic, and legendary difficulty levels. On the same note, a major flaw in this game is that the difficulty is based on the character you choose *winks* Farin, rather than the level you are playing on. Also, unlocking the 'legendary' difficutly, requires you to complete the game two times on it's fairly short storyline. This may get boring, although the lure of better items, hitting the maximum level, and uncovering all the secrets/collecting all 50 achievements is enough to keep a player going.\n\nQuests in this game is fairly one dimensional as most of them cannot be missed as long as you diligently explore the maps and talk to the NPCs. More details shoud be added to the  backstory to make this game more vibrant and interesting. 'Secrets' on the other hand requires some time spent exploring and manipulation of the ever annoying 'game save' mechanics, and this may frustrate players unless they find a guide (which there are surprisingly few online).\n\nLastly, this game UI is clearly based on the console version, and some mechanics such as character movement and inventory management, feels clunky and poorly done up. However, this is not a problem after taking some time getting used to it, although, a PC game controller will certainly improve the experience.\n\nAudio/visual: the landscapes and character design are extremely well done for a 2011 game with details such as seeing the weaves in Elrond's shirt, rock patterns in the background, and blood splatter as you chop off the orc's head. While the game's background music and action sounds are vibrant, the voice acting could be better, to add more life to the storyline, and make the hero jouney seems more epic. Together, the atmosphere of the game felt a letdown as the good visuals such as the never ending rain in Bree is not complimented with audio effects to bring about an immersive expierence.\n\nVerdict: Overall, War in the North gets more fun as you progress along the difficulty levels, and your character feels truely powerful on the final difficulty level. However, the clunky mechanics, limited depth to the character's development, quests and backstory limits this game from  being an epic RPG. Also the game design restrict it to around 60hrs of gameplay before it gets repetitive. Thus, this game would be a good buy during steam sales as a form of pasttime, but definitely not a must-have, unless you are a Lord of the Rings fan.\n\nDisclaimer: this review is written based on solo-play only, and I have yet to encounter any bugs with this game.","October 26, 2014","true","59.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Tolkien, yet providing an alternate part of the story. Here you control one of the 3 heroes from the legendary races, Dunedain ( Human ) , Elf and Dwarf.\nTalking about graphics, this game is pretty good considering it's from 2011 and uses the Dark Alliance Engine, which I find extraordinary for a hack-and-slash game like this.\nThis game earns his name as an RPG, having many characters to talk to and having enough side quests to make the story not seem linear.\nAs for battle mechanics, this game does pretty well. Fast paced action and fast responce allows the player to make extraordinary combos. To top it off, there is the "Hero Mode", which activates after a critical hit has been made. This allows the player to inflict massive quantities of damage, provided that he can hit constantly and elude the blows of enemies, most of which you knock you down or stagger you for just enough time for you to lose your combo.\nThe game lacks a bit if it is to be compared to Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, with less to barely any combos, which made the first title so enjoyable. Yet the second title compensates with alot of loot, sprinkled with that I believe to be legendary weapons, some even imbued with fire.\nOther factors to keep in mind are multiplayer and replayability. The game seems to have extraordinary capabilities for co-op support, even non-LAN-based, which LotR:RotK lacked, yet I haven't had the opportunity to try it. As for replayability, this game seems to have 3 difficulties : Normal, Hero and Legendary ( pardon me if I am mistaken ), which gives the game excelent replayability, considering that you can combine different classes with your friends to make the perfect team, where each player can choose the character best suited for him.\nIn conclusion I give this game a 9.7/10 because of the lack of the combo system that was present in LotR:RotK, and place it in my top 5 all-time favorite game list.","April 2, 2014","true","34.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can chose between three rolls, a human ranger, a elven mage, or a dwarf warrior, giving you a fair bit of variance between how exactly you kill Orcs and Uruk-hai (and a lot more.)  The maps are quite a great sight seeing experience with a large bit of map interactivity, rarely leaving the feeling of playing the same thing.\n\nThe setting itself is just so perfect for a video game, leaving you to follow your own unique LOTR story while maintaining everything which has already been made.  It truly casts you into the line of your favorite story hero, even during the co-op experience.  Which leads to the games greatest feature - Co-Op.\n\nWar in the North is AMAZING in co-op.  The game was seemingly made for it from the ground up.  If you're looking for a hack and slash co-op game, this might just be the one for you.\n\n\nSimilar games:  Warhammer 40k: Space Marine, Fable 3, Batman series, Darksiders series, Brutal Legend, Witcher 2.","February 1, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It looks good, sounds good, and you get to explore a few really interesting places and meet some fun characters in search of random loot. In a rare stroke of ambition for a Lord of the Rings game, you're also presented with an original story rather than going on the adventures of Frodo & Co. for the umpteenth time. Some parts get more than a little fanfiction-y, and combat isn't as fluid as it needs to be, but even in areas where the game has glaring flaws, you manage to have just enough fun to overlook those shortcomings.","March 25, 2014","true","24.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

What is really cool about this game is it doesn't just retell the story of the fellowship but rather a group of three with a quest equally as important. You do get to see all the characters from the movies at one point but the main focus is on your group. One thing that is rather strange is that everyone you meet is always saying how this story should be written down, but I guess that was to stress the importance of your mission. The combat in this game felt kinda dull, while you had a range of abilities you run into enemies that are just copies of each other but with different skins and greater stats. So once you master how to defeat a troll you shouldn't have a problem again. When you play singleplayer your two companions aren't really helpful for anything but reviving you. They will keep guys occupied but have no finishing capabilites. You find at the end of the mission you did 3/4 of all the damage dealt. Overall this game was a lot of fun. The side quests aren't too interesting but the main questline is where everything comes alive. If you have yet to, pick up this game and give it a shot.","December 22, 2014","true","15.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It isn't exactly amazing, but it isn't bad at all. The story is pretty good, nothing too exciting however. You don't really get any sort of connection with the characters. You're kinda just an elf, dwarf and a human who are tossed together, it feels. Throughout the game you get to visit places such as Fornost, the Barrow-downs, Rivendell and even Carn Dum, the capitol of the old Angmar empire.\n\nAs far as pros go, the story is alright, and you can tell the devs did put a bit of research into things. There's a few nice name drops here and there as well. The soundtrack is pretty good, and none of the levels are exactly impossible, though in some cases it can get that way pretty easily. Combat is alright, consists mainly of LMB for light attacks and RMB for heavier attacks, or a critical attack when the enemy has a yellow arrow over their head. You also have 3 abilities for melee and 3 for ranged, used with the 1, 2 and 3 buttons. You also have a handy eagle to call with the fourth. Combat isn't exactly amazing however, I'll admit, though it's pretty simple to get the hang of. Isn't slippery or hard to adapt to whatsoever. You and your companions are, in a way, tied in with that of the Fellowship, and several things that occur in the movies happen because of things you did, which is pretty neat.\n\nNow to the cons. This game is pretty well known to have a LOT of bugs. There's a few quests in particular that are very buggy, and you can easily screw yourself over with them. If you're focusing on whether this is canon, I've seen mostly people saying that it is not canon. The achievements aren't very bad at all, either, though the "strength of our alliance" achievement is extremely tedious to get in my experience, and is very buggy as well. There is a lot of issues when it comes to balance. As Farin, the dwarf, unlocking the explosive bolt can do up to 150k damage from what I've seen personally. Which can instant-kill trolls and usually 2-3 shot a boss. Took around 8 shots or so to kill the final boss with it. Now, what I said earlier about the levels sometimes being crazy hard comes down to you. If you run out of health potions, you do NOT have the option to save manually. So, if you go into a level, run out of potions and can't leave (example being a later stage of Nordinbad) you're pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed, and you have to do it on your own. Ended up doing this myself and trying to do it with no health potions, which isn't too easy.\n\nTo 100% complete the game there's a minimum of 3 playthroughs to get the achievement for beating the Legendary mode. This is a little bit of a con as well, in that there isn't really any sense of a challenge. Mobs do a little more damage and take some more as well, but it never really is an issue.\n\nNow, be warned, two levels in particular, the Barrow-downs and Carn Dum are very well known for crashing computers. I run the game flawlessly on ultra settings, but I crash constantly in these spots. I read that it has something to do with AMD drivers or something along the lines, but I don't know much about that. Just be warned that it does have some crashing issues.\n\nIn the end, the game is pretty good, has a good bit of replayability, it isn't boring or stretched thin, and it's pretty well rounded. It does have a lot of bugs and isn't the greatest with balance in the second and third playthroughs, (being in your favour as opposed to being in the enemy's favour) but there isn't really any game breaking issues. The community isn't too lively, though if you really want the one online achievement, you only need to post in the forums of the game that you want help and people flock to it. I believe the game has a built in system that causes open mics constantly, which is EXTREMELY annoying when you're an English speaking man, but get stuck with a very angry spanish child being scolded by his father while a Russian laughs and calls him a ♥♥♥♥♥ for it. It isn't amazing, but it isn't bad at all. I personally really like the game, it has a great feeling to it, and it's nice to be able to have a good lotr game. Be warned that the voices of the few fellowship members you meet are not the same as the movies, so don't get too hype thinking they'll make a cameo.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game. I'd give it an 8/10, only lacking the two points for the crashing issues, lack of a challenge in the later levels, and balance issues that break whatever challenge would have been from the Heroic and Legendary difficulties.\n\n(Probably worth mentioning you have NO interaction with Mordor, Sauron, Isenguard or anything of the such. You have your own quest that you and your companions are going on dealing with the North. Don't go in expecting to see the black gates.)","August 23, 2015","true","43.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

It starts off with you loading up and inviting your friends, while you are using your 3rd party chat server, you have now discovered that voice chat is forced, and there is no way to change any of the settings in game to eliminate it. Not to mention the steam voice option is just terrible in general. After you decide that, hey we will just use keyboard to chat in game, after wasting hours of time trying to fix the voice feature. Trying to join up with friends is awful, you can connect and stay in the lobby and load up the game, but once you are in game, it kicks someone randomly. Why is it that we can play so many games flawlessly and yet this game has such issues? It's because they pushed out a port of this as quick as they could, and then never patched anything, They couldn't even be bothered to put an option for disabling the chat feature.\n\nI'm so disgusted and now i'm out of hard earned money, not to mention my time that I spent trying to troubleshoot this awful game into working. I spent my entire weekend trying to get this game working being optimistic and hopeful. It's not worth it. Just stay away, go get it on whatever console that it was intended for, maybe that version will work better, but I would definitly research that carefully as well.\n\nTL;DR Version: The game is buggy and unplayable, touts a multiplayer style of gameplay that doesn't work, and doesn't allow you to disable or change any microphone settings that are very terrible.

Since the release of the game (2011) it's almost impossible for you to play the game. I have an HD 8850M which is more than enough for this, but it's so poorly optimised, that you will get stuttering every 2 minutes and the game will crash every 10 minutes.\nFortunatelly I have a 4th generation i7 and I was able to play the game on the integrated graphic card which struggled a little on medium settings, but the game was playable.\n-this game has the most  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice chat I've ever seen since I play multiplayer video games. If you join a lobby with your friends or any random person, the game will activate your microphone all the freaking time! It's almost impossible to stop it. How is it possible for someone to release in 2011 a game in which you can't deactivate the voice chat?\nAfter many tries, I finally managed to get rid of it.\n\nAll-in-all this is a great game, I would say it is very underrated and it is perfect if you don't have much time to spend on, as the campaign can be finished in 8-10 hours, but unfortunatelly, the voice chat and the AMD graphic cards problem have a huge impact on it and I'm really sorry but I can't recommend it.","November 25, 2015","false","26.7"," 53 of 102 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","53","102","5","9"

Only played a couple levels in Co-op and it's much better than doing it single player, but it's still lots of fun.\n\nIt fills in some lore around the war of the ring, mostly taken from Christopher Tolkien's "history of the war of the ring", which is pretty cool. There are several interactions with members of the fellowship of the ring. Character models based on the movies, and they got voice actors that sound kind of like the hollywood actors, but they're far enough off that it feels a bit cheesy.\n\nOtherwise the game is super generic, but has strong action controls and is pretty fun. It's basically a LOTR beat-em up. Graphics look like early XBox 360. The port is pretty lazy, so you can't tweak too much. Everything's pretty nice looking and artistically great, but it really looks like a console game.\n\nA single playthrough takes about 9-10 hours and there are 7-8 varied environments and plenty of different enemy types.\n\nRPG elemements are minimal. The skill tree is pretty cool and there's plenty of loot to be had, but companion gear management is awful and it's pretty unclear about how they level up.\n\nNote that keyboard controls are awkward. This game was designed for consoles and the port is a lazy one, so best to use a 360 controller.\n\nAll in all, a fun game that gets way better if you have some friends to do co-op with. Definitely worth picking up for around $5 which will get you a nice 10 hour playthrough. The are 2 New Game + modes that make the enemies a lot harder and the loot better, but unless you're playing with friends I can't see anybody actually wanting to do this.","October 18, 2013","true","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, after putting some more time into it, I feel that if you get this game on a heafty discout (as I did), you will definitely feel satisfied after the experience. However, I highly recommend you only buy this game if you either a) plan to play with friends, or b) have a high tolerance for frustrating games (see below).\n\nHere are a few things I think you should be aware of before you purcahse this game:\n\n- The UI is terrible. It is cleary optimized for console/controller use. Even then, it's full of nonsense. Also, be aware of the fact that unless you're using a Microsoft Xbox360 controller, you'll run into problems (I have a Steelseries 3GC, a PDP Afterglow Xbox360 controller, and a MS Xbox360 controller).\n- The AI is stupid. Your AI teammates are of little help, and tend to get in your way. If you play as the Loremaster, you'll spend a fair amount of time trying to heal them. If you play as one of the other two classes, you'll find you're doing most of the work yourself and reviving your AI teammates often.\n- The interface is terrible. The Keymapping makes little sense, is not customizable and is frustrating when dealing with 'Skill 4' and summoning Eagles (they're mapped to the same key and I have not found a way to change that).\n- The inventory system is a nightmare. Your inventory is only accessable on your current character, meaning you cannot equip your AI teammates. The AI is left to auto equip whatever inventory you're not currently using and thus makes managing it quite difficult. In multiplayer, some traded items would just disappear.\n- You cannot switch characters in game. This makes it a chore to keep your teammates up-to-date with stats. Often you'll find yourself three levels ahead of your teammates in terms of equipped skills before you get the chance to sort them out.\n- The save system is out dated. It's based off of a checkpoint system which is poorly thought out.\n- Finally, this game is poorly optimized. It is filled with bugs that may not be game breaking, but are certaintly frustrating and annoying. Including a particular graphic bug which causes a transparent white flashing throughout and entire level. I could not find a solution for this problem, and after searching the internet, I can confirm it is not my graphics card as many are plagued with the problem.\n\nIn the end, if you can get this game on a great sale and have a craving to play a Lord of the Rings themed video game - and you're willing to tolerate some frustration - this is worth it. I would also suggest Lego: Lord of the Rings. The voice acting and music comes straight from the three movies; it's very well done.\n\nAs a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's works, I think it is worth it to mention that this follows Peter Jackson's movie version, sadly. Although, it is to be expected from a WB published game.","January 27, 2014","true","14.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It seemed like a great opportunity to play my favourite game genre with my friend. And it might be a decent experience, if you get around the bugs, some of which might force you into restart.\nMy rating without the bugs is 7/10. My rating with bugs is 4/10. I would not recommend this game for its full price, but with discount and some friends to play with, you might give it a try.\n\nPROS:\n\nApart from being a co-op game there really isn't any other positive outstanding feature in this game, because as an Action-RPG game it provides only a mediocre gameplay experience and boring dialogues.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Pour graphics even for 2011. Compared to Witcher 2, which was released in the same year, LoR: War in the North is something from Stone Age.\n-Simple battle system: just fast attack and strong attack, blocking and few skills. There are no combos and, if you are patient enough, you can just hold block and attack simultaneously, without taking any damage (apart from ranged attacks)\n-Confusing crafting system, unless you learn the names of all the plants and components, it's hard to understand what will be the result of your crafting.\n- There is no push-to-talk, you are forced to listen to all the background noise from your gaming buddy's microphone.\n-If you finish a quest, you can return to complete it again. I can't understand whether it's meant to be like that or it's a bug. Either way it doesn't help you to understand what to do next.\n- No mini-map. It's a big problem in Burrow-downs cave system and Forest for apparent reasons.\n- Bad camera work – does not always follow the character.\n- BUGS!!!\n\n1. Some quests get stuck. No solution. Restart the game or change the host (if co-op).\n2. Completed quests revert back "in progress", if you return to the same area.\n3. Some enemies (bosses), which should spawn, do no appear.\n4. Sometimes it's not possible to revive your allies. Normally it's possible.\n5. I started to play this game with my friend. But on our second co-op session this game told me that he has progressed further than me and that I will not be able to get achievements and to save my progress. However none of us had played the game in single-player mode after the previous session, so we were on the same line.\n6.

Especially if you have a friend or two to play with, you can replay this game over and over and still have a great time. The element that the events of the game coincide with that of the movie trilogy is particularly nice. Also the fact you can interact with the characters of the main movies and those of the hobbit is fascinating.

I got it for a decent price around $8 and it provided me with around 12 hours of gameplay so I think I got my monies worth :)\n\nYou pick one of three characters and journey to stop one of Sauron's generals who plans to start war in the northern realms. You can pick a ranger who can dual wield, a lore master (healer mage) or a tanky dwarf. They generally all play the same with a few unique skills attached to each class. Combat consists of mashing the normal attack and hitting the strong attack once enemies are weak to cause critical damage or finish them off. Levels consist of areas where you have to defeat waves of enemies before the next area is unlocked and you pick up gear for your characters and level up.\n\nI played this game solo but I can see the real fun is with playing with friends which I haven't tried, not even sure if it works or not considering this is an older game. Your AI companions can be pretty dumb often getting preoccupied fighting one weak goon while you get swarmed by enemies. You can only switch between the characters at checkpoints which is a shame and only your main characters look will be affected by what they are wearing.\n\nThe music and the voice acting are great although some of the dialogue is cliche. You do have some dialogue choices during the story but it doesn't really matter what you pick. The story itself is weak and predictable and when you finally defeat the last boss you instantly find out that the original Fellowship completed their epic journey making your efforts seem kind of pointless.\n\nOverall great game and still playable in 2016. I only wish you can freely swap between characters in battle and setup all your characters with loot and equipment that you find in the game.","April 4","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has plenty of story, (voice acting could be better but isn't bad itself), most places you'll relate from the movies and good characters to please the fans. The gameplay has some minor bugs, nothing that ruins your experience in my point of view, because you emerse yourself in the action of the story and look aside of that to save someone or to give that finishing blow on a giant troll/giant spider XD. The controls take a couple of minutes to get used to but if you are used to play this tipe of games then it will be a piece of cake for you to play it.\nTo me, being a fan of the lord of the rings movies and all, this game is quite good and shows another side of this epic battle against evil and you feel good being a part of it and helping the heroes gain time to destroy the ring of power.\nAnd besides, just to see your character fly in one of those giant eagles like gandalf in the movies is just priceless XD\nI absolutelly recomend this game! :D","December 3, 2014","true","36.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

The only problem was the game only placed one of us in the original setting, while the other player was placed in another map.

There's a lot of good exposition and the custscenes are well done.\n\nWhile the game is firmly planted in the Action-RPG tropes of Diablo and Titan Quest, it plays a lot like Gears of Wars, minuse the cover mechanic. Sprinting feels like the "roadie run" and the rolls are almost the same. It's made using Epic's Unreal Engine 3, but its strking how much this game borrows gameplay mechanics from Gears of War with an ARPG shoehorned in and then told using the trimmings from TLoTR's plot.\n\nVisuals range from good to great and the sound is satisfying, but nothing amazing. Combat is fun and it's a delight to knock a big, ugly orc's head off and then fel his friend by slicing his leg off.\n\nIn case you're wondering, yes there is a multiplayer mode that allows you to play through the game in co-op.\n\nOverall, a nice buy for anyone a fan of ARPGs and/or TLoTR with a farily decent amount of replayablity.","November 11, 2013","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While not as tightly constructed as its predecessors, the broadened RPG elements and online functionality safely glides the game into the recommendable category. Each character plays uniquely enough, with three skills trees each to vary things even more. The combat plays similar enough to the aforesaid games, albeit with some Arkham counter-attacks thrown in. Very fun. Very silly.\n\nBut be warned...\nThat said, if you're searching for an expansive single-player RPG, keep looking. This game was made for online coop, something blatantly evident during offline party management. Simply described, there are two inventories: the player's inventory and the AI's inventory. The player's inventory encompasses any currently controlled character (whichever they may be), whether offline or online. But the AI's exists utterly autonomously (as it would with another player).\n\nSo say you're playing the ranger when you pick up a nice axe you'd like to use when playing the dwarf. To trade it, you need to save and exit the current game and reenter as the dwarf character. Think of it as logging and relogging between two toons on an MMO, except all of your characters share the same loot bags. Conversely, and this is IMPORTANT, if you just trade the axe to the cpu version of the dwarf, the item will be cast into the nether: the cpu's inventory. You will not get it back. You cannot force the npc to wield it. When you log into the dwarf character, you will not find it.\n\nThis extends to leveling up as well. As much as you may enjoy playing a particular character, I highly advise you regularly redo previous missions with whatever characters you've been neglecting. They will not level up or progress their skill branches on their own. They will gain XP, to be fair, but they become increasingly outmatched as the game goes on.

The game almost feels like a third person Diablo which may sound bad but to be honest it's quite enjoyable finding new loot and new armor. In terms of what I dislike...

The crossbow is useful because you can get an upgrade that allows for an explosive bolt every once in a while.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/k4kuz0/recommended/32800/","k4kuz0","SleepyBear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/k4kuz0/","219 products in account","A decent game, if you know what you're going to get\n\nI really did enjoy this game. I love the Tolkein universe and I think the idea of the story running parallel to the story from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy worked well here. Do not expect an RPG experience, this is much more of a hack and slash, and there are many moments that break the 'immersion' of an RPG game (randomly buying items, mid level, from a floating pool of light, etc.).\n\nStory/Presentation: 6/10\n\nAgandaur, a high ranking commander of Sauron's forces is marching to destroy the north, and you must stop him. That is the meat of the story. Whilst this is nothing original, and there are no plot twists and things to keep you guessing, it serves its job well enough. The story is fleshed out with characters from the Original LOTR story (Gandalf, Aragorn etc.) and it works well to keep to the original lore (from what I know). There are side quests, but they are sparse and sometimes hard to give a crap about. I finished many of them without even realising (found an item from killing an orc, turns out a dwarf wanted it for a quest).\nI say 6/10 because as stories go, it is hard to go wrong when Tolkein has done the bulk of the work! The thing that brings this score down to me is how bland the playable characters are. There are many characters in this game that have quite interesting personas, the playable characters are not among them.\n\nGameplay: 5.5/10\n\nNothing inventive here. I played the ranger all the way through, and although the abilities that you learn (from a talent tree similar to world of warcraft), I found that most of the time you'll be mashing the attack button from start to finish. There are some AI problems, if your allies (who were clearly designed to be played by friends) see a ranged unit, they will walk slowly towards them, shooting at them, whilst melee heroes hack them to pieces. Other than that the AI is actually quite fine. I will also note here that you can 'switch character', but you lose all items from your first character unless you switch back again, so I really don't see the point. It seems like a big design flaw to me, but I had no need to change my character anyway. 5.5/10 because it serves its purpose fine, and there's a lot of gore and fun to be had, but at the end of the day its too repetitive.\n\nVisuals: 8/10\n\nWhilst the graphics are nothing to rave about, they are really quite good. The linearity of the game means that the surrounding environments look quite beautiful, and there has been quite a lot of effort clearly put in to the design of the scenes. I am also going to mention the gore as well, it is nice to see a bit of blood and severred limbs that is startlingly absent in almost all Lord of the Rings games. The hack and slash gameplay IS quite repetitive, but lopping heads and arms off never really gets old.\n\nReplayability 6/10\n\nWhilst I doubt I will play through the game again, there is the option to do so with a higher difficulty, and naturally with another player character.

Not sure what went wrong there.\n\nIf you accept all the problems some computers might have with this game it is awesome and you should get it.

When I finally aquired the game, I dove into the world of Tolkien once more. And I was fairly happy with the results that I've found.\n\nFirst of all let me say that the world of LOTR "war in the north" is a delicous a mish mash from many of Tolkiens LOTR's resorces. Like the books, movies, cartoon animations as well as the endless Imagination of snowblind studio. Which makes a woundful effort in blending the game into character with the rest of the other stories without feeling stragnly out of place. The visuals are just amazing and the dialog is heroic and thoughtful.\n\nThe events of  LOTR "war in the north" characters were invented, well crafted, and detailed by the grandfather of modern fantasy Tolkien. You play either one of three main characters: the female elf lore master Andriel " the sorceress ", the dwarf warrior Farin "the warrior tank", and a human Dúnedain ranger Eradan "the roge". In the beging the trio are seen walking into the Prancing Pony in  the city of bree, heading to a table were Aragorn is sitting. They inform him that the Shire Guard at San Ford was attacked and that the Rangers have suffered a great loss. After the raid a Ringwraith mets with a man of great malice and power called Agandaur. He tells the Ringwraith that he had done as Sauron commanded and he has started gathering the Orcs of the north at the old ruins of Fornost. Farin questions why the enemy would build up a force against the Shire and Aragorn replies that a hobbit with a great burden is on the move to Bree. He asks them to help him keep the Hobbit safe by thwarting the enemies preparations at Fornost. And so begins your adventure.\n\nThe game play is a decent standard type of action RPG . Nothing ground braking INTERSTELLER MECHANICES THAT CHANGES THE GAMING WORLD!!! or anything like that. Nevertheless, still decent.\nAll three characters have mele and range attacks when battlling the endless hordes of orcs, cave trolls and goblins. There is also a combo system which makes the game more responsive. When a yellow bar shows on an enemy's head you get a chance to do a critical strike chope some heads off and gaining more XP.\nThe pacing of the game is done well. However, there are too many mounted cressbows sequences\nthat kinda feels repetitive to a point.\nOn the other hand the game has a good co-op game play of three players. Which changed the expreance of the game altogether. You and 2 more of your friends can jon forces and lead the attack on the eeevil orc meness. And saving the hobbits for certain dooooooooom.\n\nOverall, the game is a wonderful piece of art that shouldn't be overlooked.","May 11, 2014","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I love the Tolkein universe and I think the idea of the story running parallel to the story from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy worked well here. Do not expect an RPG experience, this is much more of a hack and slash, and there are many moments that break the 'immersion' of an RPG game (randomly buying items, mid level, from a floating pool of light, etc.).\n\nStory/Presentation: 6/10\n\nAgandaur, a high ranking commander of Sauron's forces is marching to destroy the north, and you must stop him. That is the meat of the story. Whilst this is nothing original, and there are no plot twists and things to keep you guessing, it serves its job well enough. The story is fleshed out with characters from the Original LOTR story (Gandalf, Aragorn etc.) and it works well to keep to the original lore (from what I know). There are side quests, but they are sparse and sometimes hard to give a crap about. I finished many of them without even realising (found an item from killing an orc, turns out a dwarf wanted it for a quest).\nI say 6/10 because as stories go, it is hard to go wrong when Tolkein has done the bulk of the work! The thing that brings this score down to me is how bland the playable characters are. There are many characters in this game that have quite interesting personas, the playable characters are not among them.\n\nGameplay: 5.5/10\n\nNothing inventive here. I played the ranger all the way through, and although the abilities that you learn (from a talent tree similar to world of warcraft), I found that most of the time you'll be mashing the attack button from start to finish. There are some AI problems, if your allies (who were clearly designed to be played by friends) see a ranged unit, they will walk slowly towards them, shooting at them, whilst melee heroes hack them to pieces. Other than that the AI is actually quite fine. I will also note here that you can 'switch character', but you lose all items from your first character unless you switch back again, so I really don't see the point. It seems like a big design flaw to me, but I had no need to change my character anyway. 5.5/10 because it serves its purpose fine, and there's a lot of gore and fun to be had, but at the end of the day its too repetitive.\n\nVisuals: 8/10\n\nWhilst the graphics are nothing to rave about, they are really quite good. The linearity of the game means that the surrounding environments look quite beautiful, and there has been quite a lot of effort clearly put in to the design of the scenes. I am also going to mention the gore as well, it is nice to see a bit of blood and severred limbs that is startlingly absent in almost all Lord of the Rings games. The hack and slash gameplay IS quite repetitive, but lopping heads and arms off never really gets old.\n\nReplayability 6/10\n\nWhilst I doubt I will play through the game again, there is the option to do so with a higher difficulty, and naturally with another player character. I think this is a nice idea, but personally I would have rather put the difficulty higher on my first playthrough, than be forced to wait until I've completed the game once. That being said, it's a nice option, and I think many will enjoy playing through again with a second character.\n\nConclusion: 6/10\n\nA fun game, nothing special, but worth a play through. I don't think this game is worth a full price purchase, but if you see it on offer definitely give it a go. I got this game from the humble bundle, and I thought I'd end up brushing over if but I'm glad that I didn't.

I really can not fathom why. Looking at the game (which was made for consoles and later ported to PC) I'd give it a 9/10. It offers really excellent storytelling and TONS of lore and LOTR backstory that you would miss out on in a pure action RPG. I also really enjoyed the cooperative experience the game provided, as I haven't had something like it since the days of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. Playing the game alone is alright, but cooping it with 2 friends makes it outstanding.  My only complaint is that is a straight from console port, which means the textures and graphics quality don't keep up with what is "normal" for pc games these days. That being said, the animations are very smooth and pleasing to do and look at. The music is fantastic and rings true of LOTR, and the voice acting is actually pretty decent.

Only issue with the game is that if you play multiplayer the will be in game voice chat between you which you are unable to get rid off. So its somewhat annoying when your on skype and you have to listen to the echo from the game.","January 4, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/recommended/32800/","Nawrusi","Nawrusi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/","789 products in account","This game is based in the lord of the rings universe, and the story takes place, at the same time as the first lord of the rings movie.\n\nIf you know something about lord of the rings, you would properly like this games story to some extend. The game builds on the lord of the rings universe, and you have to visit locations, that are kind of new to the averige lord of the ring knower.\nThe game still focuses on main charecters such as the fellowship of the ring, and many more main charecters. Your journy in the game has nothing to do with the fellowship, but focuses on killing Saruns right hand (sorry if I spell some names wrong, but they are not so commen)\n\nYour journy starts at an inn, and then you move on througout the lord of the rings universe. This brings you far around the country, and you get to visit many interesting locations. There is a forrest with spiders, an underground cave with undead, A fortres with orcs just to name a few of the locations.\n\nYou can take controle of one of three charecters. Each charecer, has his or hers own thing to do for the team. We have a dwarf, who functions as tank for the team, which mean he will be the first to attack, and the one to take the most damage, but still have enough life to surviev. This character uses heavy weapons and crossbows mostely, but can also use small weapons to channge things up.\n\nThe secound charecter is a human, who mainly focuses on range attacks, but can also go into combat with duelweld, or a sword, and a sheild. Since this charecter is mainly focusing on damaging, he is the one to damage enemys, while the tank, takes the beating from all the enemyes. Of couse the dwarf can fight by themselves, and thats why the game is great, becouse you can basicly do whatever you want, when it comes to classes.\n\nThe last charecter is an elven mage, who focuses on healing. She uses magicel attacks to attack enemyes, but is the weakest of the three and therefore needs the most protection.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit different for each of the three charecters, and therefore you can have a different experince with each charecter. But the goal is the same with all three, kill all the enemyes as a team.\n\nThe game is best to play with you friends, and since there is only three classes, you don`t have to hold the big gamer party, in order to have fun with this game. I completed the game with two of my friends and we really enjoyed the game, all the way through. We can say though, the story felt a bid lacky at the end, but I will of couse not spoil it. But if you know your lord of the rings movies, you will know what happens at the end of the first movie, and therefore the ending will not be a huge surprise for you.\n\nThe loot and trade system between charecters is a bid odd, but besides that, you can clearly see when your charecter evolves on he`s or her`s equipment througout the game, this gives a really satesfing feeling, which you will know for neally all RPG`s.\n\nNow I want to talk about the ending, that is not about the plot, but more like the events at the ending. In the end of the game you get all kinds of awesome items, and you get all new and great talents. But then you fight an easy end boss, and all that awesome stuff you just got, can`t be used, I know you can play your charecter on another person playthrough, but still, the game is far to short to do all the stuff you want to do.\n\nA note to end on, the AI in this game is good, but only for your enemyes, if you play the game alone, you will see your allies are really bad, and don`t really contebute with anything. This is a problem if the charecter you need is the healer, since the healer won`t. Well, heal at times.\n\nThis game is really good, and I highly recommend to play it with you friends to get the full experince of the game. But you can of couse play it by youself, and still have a good time with it. This game get`s a thumps up. 6 out of 10","April 24, 2014","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really can not fathom why. Looking at the game (which was made for consoles and later ported to PC) I'd give it a 9/10. It offers really excellent storytelling and TONS of lore and LOTR backstory that you would miss out on in a pure action RPG. I also really enjoyed the cooperative experience the game provided, as I haven't had something like it since the days of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. Playing the game alone is alright, but cooping it with 2 friends makes it outstanding.  My only complaint is that is a straight from console port, which means the textures and graphics quality don't keep up with what is "normal" for pc games these days. That being said, the animations are very smooth and pleasing to do and look at. The music is fantastic and rings true of LOTR, and the voice acting is actually pretty decent.

Tolkien's book and films.\n\nIt's a respectful hack and slash action rpg, with the major gripes being the lack of much ability progression and a lot of the same enemies appearing over and over again. A mildly coherent tale against a relatively unknown antagonist is only brought back from boredom due to the rich lore that has been previously established.\n\nReminded me of the Two Towers on PS2 back in the day. Three characters playing on screen, Each one has their own unique moves, spells, and abilities and you fight against Sauron's minions in the North. One can get involved with alchemy, another with breaking down walls to find treasures, upgradeable weapons, gear armour etc. Other games do everything it offers better. There are a few short appearances from the major LOTR characters in Rivendell but their sudden appearance and disappearance only cements the insignifance of the playable characters. Campaigh is about 10-12 hours long, bit longer I would think on higher difficulties.\n\nBest fun is the 3 player co-op. Got this on a Humble Bundle nearly a year ago, but worth a look if you have it and are itching for an average Action RPG or a LOTR game til Shadow of Mordor arrives.","July 2, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GazNation/recommended/32800/","GazNation","Gazpins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GazNation/","165 products in account","It's a decent game, there are just some flaws which bring it down. I originally played through basically the entire game on PS3 until a glitch occurred that made it so I was unable to progress past the spider boss regardless of how many times I beat it.\n\nThe game is quite a bit of fun on co-op and the combat is simple and satisfying. However, quite possibly the biggest problem with this is that the game forces voice chat upon you. There is no options in-game to disable the voice, make it push-to-talk, or to even mute other players. There is no way to disable the voice in this game without disabling the audio entirely. This wouldn't be a problem if the game chat was half decent, but from my experience it's delayed, echoey, and just overall unpleasant. Apparently there are work arounds for this, but I couldn't manage to figure them out, and really, I shouldn't have to go through that just to do something that should be so simple. Eventually I found the voice chat as part of the game's charm, but I don't really mean that in a good way.\n\nThe skill trees offer a basic variation to each of the characters' playstyles without getting unnecessarily complex. Treasure chests and hidden caches give a reason to off the path in search of better gear. There isn't much exploration to do otherwise, though. If you enjoy always getting new gear and improving stats (like me) then you will enjoy the equipment aspect of this game.\n\nCombat can get a bit tedious and there doesn't seem to really be variation in objectives. It's always going to be go here, defend here, open this all whilst holding off waves of orcs and the like. This is kind of to be expected, though. It's not like there was much else that could have been done with this style of game, but in long sessions you may find the game becoming repetitive.\n\nIf you have friends to play this with I would recommend it. Maybe not for $20 though. If you don't have friends, well, the AI isn't all that sturdy from my experience, so you'll be doing a lot of reviving.\n\nGloin / 10.","March 16","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a pretty decent storyline, good voice acting, and good graphics, and excellent replay value. You get to talk to some major LOTR characters, and fly around on giant eagles that look like they are wearing amazing feathery pants (I'm not even kidding). The inventory and level-up systems are great, making the RPG element of the game extra fun. The co-op feature is definitely worth getting into as well. I've honestly yet to find a game like this that I've enjoyed nearly as much.\n\nBiggest issue I have with this game is the crashes. In graphics-intensive parts (specifically chapters 2 and 8) it almost never fails that the game will freeze, then crash altogether. This seems to happen with AMD cards and renders the game unfinishable for anyone running on AMD from what I've been able to research. If you're running NVIDIA you should be fine. I actually purchased War in the North used for xbox 360 to avoid a lot of these issues because it was less hassal than swapping out my card.\n\nIt's a shame they haven't fixed the crashing problems (it seems the developers have written this one off), or this game would be A+, and well worth the $20. As it stands, however, I'd suggest purchasing the game when it goes on sale, and be prepared to deal with a few bugs. Apart from the bugs War in the North is everything I personally want in a hack and slash RPG; the game itself is fun enough to inspire me to buy it, again, on a separate consol- if that says anything.","November 11, 2015","true","63.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GazNation/recommended/32800/","GazNation","Gazpins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GazNation/","165 products in account","It's a decent game, there are just some flaws which bring it down. I originally played through basically the entire game on PS3 until a glitch occurred that made it so I was unable to progress past the spider boss regardless of how many times I beat it.\n\nThe game is quite a bit of fun on co-op and the combat is simple and satisfying. However, quite possibly the biggest problem with this is that the game forces voice chat upon you. There is no options in-game to disable the voice, make it push-to-talk, or to even mute other players. There is no way to disable the voice in this game without disabling the audio entirely. This wouldn't be a problem if the game chat was half decent, but from my experience it's delayed, echoey, and just overall unpleasant. Apparently there are work arounds for this, but I couldn't manage to figure them out, and really, I shouldn't have to go through that just to do something that should be so simple. Eventually I found the voice chat as part of the game's charm, but I don't really mean that in a good way.\n\nThe skill trees offer a basic variation to each of the characters' playstyles without getting unnecessarily complex. Treasure chests and hidden caches give a reason to off the path in search of better gear. There isn't much exploration to do otherwise, though. If you enjoy always getting new gear and improving stats (like me) then you will enjoy the equipment aspect of this game.\n\nCombat can get a bit tedious and there doesn't seem to really be variation in objectives. It's always going to be go here, defend here, open this all whilst holding off waves of orcs and the like. This is kind of to be expected, though. It's not like there was much else that could have been done with this style of game, but in long sessions you may find the game becoming repetitive.\n\nIf you have friends to play this with I would recommend it. Maybe not for $20 though. If you don't have friends, well, the AI isn't all that sturdy from my experience, so you'll be doing a lot of reviving.\n\nGloin / 10.","March 16","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a pretty decent storyline, good voice acting, and good graphics, and excellent replay value. You get to talk to some major LOTR characters, and fly around on giant eagles that look like they are wearing amazing feathery pants (I'm not even kidding). The inventory and level-up systems are great, making the RPG element of the game extra fun. The co-op feature is definitely worth getting into as well. I've honestly yet to find a game like this that I've enjoyed nearly as much.\n\nBiggest issue I have with this game is the crashes. In graphics-intensive parts (specifically chapters 2 and 8) it almost never fails that the game will freeze, then crash altogether. This seems to happen with AMD cards and renders the game unfinishable for anyone running on AMD from what I've been able to research. If you're running NVIDIA you should be fine. I actually purchased War in the North used for xbox 360 to avoid a lot of these issues because it was less hassal than swapping out my card.\n\nIt's a shame they haven't fixed the crashing problems (it seems the developers have written this one off), or this game would be A+, and well worth the $20. As it stands, however, I'd suggest purchasing the game when it goes on sale, and be prepared to deal with a few bugs. Apart from the bugs War in the North is everything I personally want in a hack and slash RPG; the game itself is fun enough to inspire me to buy it, again, on a separate consol- if that says anything.","November 11, 2015","true","63.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

For us, there was a specific order in which we had to set everything up, one of us had to switch to a different computer, the other one had to be the host and every one of us had to make some funny sound settings to disable the ingame voice.\n\nBut after all that I really did enjoy venturing out with my friends. The combats were somewhat interesting, though we only finished on normal mode were everything is a little bit too easy, and the abilities matched the characters. We played the default MMO setup with healer (my role), tank and damage dealer, which worked great.\n\nSome abilities seem to be a little overpowered. There is, for example, this big shield (we called it "the bubble"), which deflects every projectile anybody shoots at you and heals you. This includes bosses. Therefore you sit in it waiting and shouting in order to get the bosses in melee range.\n\nAll in all, the dialogs are linear but believable and well made, the story feels good and the atmosphere is deep, even though it can get a little monotone after too long periods. The graphics are not the best I've seen even for the time the game was released, but they are still not too bad to look at. The textures of your armor and characters are somewhat well made even though some animations may be a little set off. Sometimes the voice isn't fully synced.\n\nWe finished the game in about 10 hours in 3 sessions.","April 9","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On average my game crashed every about every 2 hours. I reinstalled the video drivers and even tried beta versions but this did not resolve the problem. Some say you have to install a really old driver to fix the issue but I have not verified this. Otherwise, the game runs smooth on highest quality, except for the last area which seems to be laggy for a lot of people even with newer GPUs or Nvidia ones.\nIt feels like the difficulty doesn't scale up in Heroic and Legendary modes. I would not have minded e.g. twice the number of enemies on hardest difficulty.\nThe game only saves when you see the save icon, so not necessarily after travelling or a boss fight. You might want to talk to a shop keep or smith and cancel out to force a save if you just got some new loot or a reward.\nThe AI can be derpy at times too. Buddies and enemies can get stuck in some areas or teleport around.\nOne optional mission (the mithril one) can not be completed without someone playing as dwarf. If you are playing by yourself as either lore-master or ranger you will have to revisit a certain area as a dwarf.\nI think there is a money glitch which gives you infinite money once you reach 999,999. At least you can buy some nice equipment for your buddies (like 300k crossbows).\nLevel capped at 40. It would be sweet to be able to unlock and upgrade all skills and be even more OP. Oh well.\nPlayed on: Windows 7 with Xbox 360 controller, 3 playthroughs as lore-master (1 in co-op), all achievements.","August 10, 2014","true","42.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This one... is AWESOME.There really is not exxagertation in my use of this term. The graphics and voice acting and constant freshness of the storylines inspire awe and leave you feeling the effects of it on a level that is just pure enjoyable FUN.\n\nI have played close to every Middle Earth based game that has existed to date, from pen and paper campaigns to console to old school computer varieties and I can honestly say-I have not played such a purely great Lord of the Rings/Middle Earth game in more than a decade.\n\nA wonderfully fresh and unique storyline within the LoTR Universe,the beautiful graphics, easy controls all add up to make it great.\n\nTo to top it all off, it does not even come with any sort of steep or long term learning curve. Less than 30 minutes in, and you will be a pro at controlling every aspect of your character from simple combat to speclized moves.\n\nThe voice acting is beautifully done for all cut scenes, both full and user input questioons/responses.\n\nJust a truly wonderful Middle-Earth game, and well worth the investment.\n\nWant more information? You start your role as not one of the major movie characters-but rather, a enitrely new storyline. Connected to the same time as the events of the main LoTR books and characters, but your own adventure. This gives two major advantages: One, the story is fresh and new. You don't automatically know what the next turn in the story will bring. The second bonus is that by having your own character, you have more 'freedom' in the way your character plays out. You have your own opinions and thoughts on the events that happen and are given different options to discuss and respond to them. This makes the character fel like it is yours, rather than you just steering a well-known character down the same, well worn path that everyone knows by heart from the books and films.\n\nThe con? If there is a con here-it would be that it may just be too addictive. You can easily lose yourself in it for hours at a stretch.  I honestly have nothing bad I can say about this particular RPG and in such a vast genre with so many options, there are very few games within it that can get this level of praise from me.\n\nLong story short: if you are only going to get one game in a month at this price, any fan of the RPG Genre, and especially lovers of the Middle Earth world, would be well-advised to choose this game to spend their hard earned cash on. It is worth every penny.","November 16, 2013","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game was a personal favorite of mine. You battle through the North, accompanied with loyal friends, on a variety of dificulties with boss battles at the end of each level providing a harder challenge each time. On completion of the game you can restart to where it all begins with all your gear and complete it on a higher difficulty. The game also  has multiplayer for those missions you need help with.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azundris/recommended/32800/","Azundris","Azundris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azundris/","247 products in account","Many LotR fans might expect a slow-paced, narrative-heavy, immersive experience. War in the North however just gives you a middle-earthy vignette or a short stay in a very stripped down Bree, Imladris, etc. to provide you with weapon repairs, a shop, and an excuse to leave said location after ten minutes or less. Thus the equipped, we meet the meat of the game, a very linear romp through dungeons, moors, forests etc. where our job is to whack everything we meet. That's it. It's actually quite fun, but in a "a drink and a laugh" (ideally with up to two mates in co-op mode) way more than in a "curled up with a book and an unending sense of wonder" way, if that makes any sense. The game feels extremely arcade-y, from graphics to linearity to gameplay. (To actually put it in a real arcade, they'd have to turn the RPG-y clickable dialogs into cut scenes, and that'd be it.)\n\nMechanics: The game has three main characters (dwarven "warrior", human "ranger", elven "wizard"), of which the latter is a woman. Each character has their own skill tree. Characters that don't have a human player are controller by the AI (so if you play solo, you'll play in a group of three with two computer-controlled characters). The looks of your avatar can be edited (if you manage to find a mirror in-game, of which there are at least two), but the editor is very basic (a handful of attributes with six or so values each (hair color, face shape, eye color, hairdo -- in fact, that may be it already).\n\nThe game caters to the casual gamer. The combat system provides for some token variation without being complicated, and it's nigh impossible to get lost in the levels. If you only get to play once a  week, no problem, it's not like you could forget the current quest ("follow the path, kill everything"). The player characters are never really fleshed out in terms of backstory, so that's another thing you can't forget, and the story is pretty straight forward. Easy mode actually is easy. The game works nicely with a 360 controller. I can't speak to the other two classes, but the "loremaster" (wizard) skill tree had a sufficient amount of sane options.\n\nGameplay for the most part is quite fluid, though confusingly, WitN introduces a variety of game elements early on (while you're still learning the ropes and what to expect from the world; there is no out-and-out tutorial level) that are never picked up again later -- there's a side-quest that will timeout and fail if you do too many other things before completing that quest, but it seems to be the only one that does that. There are "mines" in the very first location that we're taught can be used to break large structures in the environment, except that we never see the mines again later on, and there's pretty much 0 interaction with the superstructure for the rest of the game. Another early level has a "find the key to progress through this door" situation, but again, it's the only time that happens in the entire game. (To add insult to injury, this happens after we've been taught for a good while what chests look like in the game -- only for the key to be in the sole chest in the game that looks different. Specifically, it looks like a slab of stone or a sarcophagus or what not. Also, it's in the darkest part of the dungeon, so, good luck not running past it.) Mind, those things are not so much a nuisance as they are puzzling. Had they planned to have more content to that effect? Was QC asleep? What was going on? :)\n\nLong story short, if you like fantasy and would like to solo or co-op through linear levels of a fantasy world that happens to nominally be MiddleEarth (it's much easier to believe the Middle-Earth part during the interludes; the action/arcade sequences feel like they could be anything), go for it. It's a nice, uncomplicated, casual game. If you're more the RPG/adventure type or expect deep immersion or generally feel like Tolkien is serious business, you may wish to give this game a pass.\n\nBought for $1.99 or so during Steam Sale, which, seeing as I completed the game, made it an excellent buy. Buy at $4.99 or better. It may only be worth full price to big LotR fans -- ones who are OK with the premise of an arcade-y game, and one where you don't play a character from the books.\n","February 3, 2014","true","45.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","6"

The Lord of the Rings, War in the North adds to the story that comes from the movies and books, and also tells you what is happning in the other parts of Middle Earth while Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring are traveling from Rivindell to Mordor. The gameplay is fun and the graphics are fairly good, but even if the graphics were old and bad i would still play this game just becouse it is related to The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit. And thoughe the game adds new villans, it is still basicaly the Dark Lord Souron and his evil servents you are fighting. This game also has some charcters you might be familar with such as, Strider/Aragon, mention of Frodo, Gandalfs voice, and even a scene with the 9 Nazgul or Ringwraiths, witch has the a the Witch King of Angmar speaking to the man you is leading the war in the North.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AWACS-Jason/recommended/32800/","AWACS-Jason","AWACS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AWACS-Jason/","110 products in account","This game is REALLY average. The combat consists of LEFT CLICKING and Spacebar. Oh, and right click when you see an orange triangle. The combat is extremely boring, and unengaging. It's also really annoying when enemies constantly stun-lock you. Enemies with 2 weapons are the worst, you'll constantly be hit and stun locked unless you block them, but if you are constantly being hit in the first place, you won't be able to block because you are already being stunned. The game throws tons of enemies at you, mostly to hide the fact that the game has a shallow combat system. You can press space to roll, which clips you through enemies, and is extremely effective. There's not even a penalty to spamming the roll! Meh. The enemy types in the game are also usually very meh as well.   Your AI teammates are the dumbest people out there, if the last one is alive, they will constantly try to revive you, NO MATTER WHAT. Even if there's only 1 hit left to finish the boss. Or they won't even try to evade the enemy, they'll just take it in order to revive someone.\nRegarding certain enemies, there are big ones who smash you, and toss you and make you ragdoll around. These are easy to beat, but when there are multiple enemies, it's a chore, because you'll be forced to hit them 1 or 2 times, roll away, come back and hit them again. You'll be able to use abilities here and there, but those aren't very effective and they cost 'power'. The game also has an RPG element that is very basic. You get XP from killing stuff, then you level up. After you level up, you put points into attributes and you pick abilities, either passive, or activated.  There are very few abilities, and they aren't very interesting, save for the Ranger's Stealth, the Lore-Masters bubble shield thingy, and the Dwarfs War Cry that supposedly does something useful. The game also has really bad AI management. You tell them to attack or defend. That's it. AND even when you tell them to defend, they will often times, leave you to kill an enemy. When you give them gear, they will throw it away most of the time and use one that sucks, because you can't manage their inventory. They will usually throw it away once it breaks or reaches low durability from what I can tell. This is also very annoying, because they will toss away high tier gear in order to replace it with ANYTHING that isn't about to break. You can't even tell if it's about to break, you just stare at your teammates and check if what they are wearing looks cool. If it doesn't you probably need to add new gear to them. The story in this game is incredibly bland. SURE, it's staying true to the book, but that doesn't mean you can't add anything that makes it interesting. The main characters are also just people you don't really care about, you don't even get to know their real backstory, and you get no emotional ties with them at all whatsoever, unless you get hard looking at the elf. Regardless, the story is also only about 10 hours long, longer if you do it alone, and shorter with friends.\nThat's including the side-quests. There are about 20 ( or less ) side quests in the game. I'm not even kidding. And the rewards are usually rendered useless by 2-3 levels anyways. The game's matchmaking found me with no players, so I assume no one plays this anymore. You can trade items to other players, but that only matters if you can actually find someone to play CO-OP with.\n\nOverall, the game is really bland. It doesn't have any variety, and it's KEY selling points are average. I thought the game would be better, but I am disappointed with what I saw. It could have used a better combat system, better AI, better enemy variety, and better RPG mechanics. If it had all of those, I'd give it an 8/10 if I were to score it.\nBut if I were to give it a score right now, I'd say 6/10, and that's being generous, as I do know the series, and I appreciate the amount of time they put into the lore.\n( not pointing out the bug where the dwarf calls a ranger 'KINSMAN'  )","November 10, 2013","false","13.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But beware if you plan on playing this game you will have to play co-op or have to play as the dwarf to get the skill taunt, as in chapter 7 part 3 its pretty impossible to kill 2 trolls whilst needing to protect a gate. The game also has more flaws such as this being an RPG you cant swap characters and this is very annoying as you cannnot choose what upgrades for them nor can you change thier equipment, you can only give them items, whether they use them or not is another matter so you have to take notes down as to what defence and strength they have.","July 27, 2015","true","8.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Most of the time you can only interact with them in "safe" hubs like towns and scripted cut-scenes.\n\nEven if you didn't watch the movies, there's fair amount of lore available through dialogues if you chose investigate dialogue options. I didn't encounter choice and consequence in dialogues, so probably they are straight forward and just there for information, lore and story.\n\nCombat is mostly hack and slash, with melee weapons as well as ranged ones, depending on hero. You defeat enemies, find loot in linear levels with some hidden passages and secrets here and there. After leveling up you get skill points you can spec into 3 trees, and stats points you can increase stats with, so your basic RPG elements.\n\nYou can find, buy or get as a reward different kinds of armor pieces and weapons. I have no clue if you can equip your AI controlled allies, but you can trade with them, and if you play in co-op, it's a good idea to trade and offer items you don't use to party members, as you often find items not wearable by your hero.\n\nCo-op is strongest aspect of this game, it's really fun and enjoyable, with great synergy between heroes. Dwarf can be tank or tanky melee warrior, Elf has healing, shields and support spells, and Human is basically archer or rogue damage dealer. All heroes have some sort of ranged attacks and require some aiming to successfully hit enemies.\n\nGame offers some side quests and challenge locations besides the main story. You can revisit almost any level for additional loot and XP. Dwarf can collect ore and bash through weak walls to uncover secret areas. Elf can gather herbs and brew potions as well as dispel magically sealed areas. Human however can only gather hidden cashes of supplies, and is a bit dull compared to other heroes.\n\nThere's decent variety of enemies in the game, orcs, trolls, spiders, humans, wyrms, dragons, just to name a few. AI is straight forward, usually rushing you head on as melee or shooting from range with ranged attacks, bigger creatures and bosses have special attacks and require careful positioning or dodging to not get hit. You can easily fall in battle after couple direct hits, unless you dodge or block the attacks.\n\nEnvironments look good yet lack detail, texture quality on characters is decent with somewhat low quality on environments. Visually game looks similar to "Game of Thrones" game. Voice acting and facial animations are decent enough and sound similar to the characters from the movies, yet I doubt there's any line from the actual actors in the game.\n\nFor a game made in 2011 it doesn't look that good, and could be much better with serious polish, never the less the story and 3 player co-op makes this game very enjoyable 12 hour experience. With hero switching and story replay on harder difficulties, this game will give you up to 30 hours of "content". I experienced some disconnects while playing in co-op, so it has some network issues, make sure if someone disconnect to not advance in story, and just remake the lobby.\n\nEnjoy.","September 20, 2015","true","12.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Yes.\nWhat's the catch? Of course there's a catch:\n\nSTORY: The story in this is interesting, but don't expect some major twist. If you played the Third Age, it's kind of that same setup. Your mission is to support the fellowship by distacting Sauron's forces away from Frodo and gang. You'll meet the likes Aragon and Gandalf, but there's one problem: the voice acting. I'll give Gandalf's voice actor credit, he really tries to sound like Sir Ian, but he just falls short. Aragon's is just awful. It's not to the point where I can't listen to it, but don't be suprised when he sound's nothing like his film counterpart.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The gameplay is what I imagine would happen if you took Dragon Age and Skyrim and paid them to make a baby. You've got the run around and find loot off of enemies and hidden chests like Skyrim (Yes, I know Dragon Age has it but I don't have to go find a Rogue whenever I find a chest in this game). The combat itself feels like a mix of Dragon Age, Skyrim, Arkham, and only the slightest hint of Gears of War. You have your two team mates that do somewhat support you unless you're playing in Coop (That's an entirely different discussion) and in a way it reminds me of Dragon Age, except that I have no control over them. It's like Skyrim in that there is no pause feature; you are constantly in the midst of the battle. It's like Arkham in the sense that you have really neat slow motion finishing moves occasionally (Yes, I know Skyrim has those, too, but I think that Arkham's has more in common with the style this game has). When I saw Gears of War, though, I don't refer to the cover shooting mechanic, I mean more of the coop system. Even in a singleplayer game, when you lose all of your health, you will go into a downed position and can slowly crawl to your teammates like in Gears. The constant, "Get on that turret!" command also seems reminicient of Gears to me, also. Aside from combat, you will be navigating a fairly linear world populated with breakable barrels, secret caches, and tons of Orcs. It's fairly simple in that regard. You progress through the level, break barrels for ammo, loot, and coins, occasionally stop at random places to purchase new gear or sell loot, and then carry on.\n\nGRAPHICS: I would say these Graphics remind me of Dragon Age 2, particularly in the environment. The way it's textured and modeled just reminds me of it. The ground doesn't look like, say, Halo or Crysis where you look at the ground and think how pretty it looks (I know that sounds weird, but seriously look down sometimes.) The ground looks like it kind of all blends together and there is no distinct place where a rock sticks up or grass ends and sand or dirt starts aside from a bland change in texture on a flat face. The characters, on the other hand, are an entirely different story. The characters look really sharp and well rendered. The clothes flow when you run, there aren't random sharp edges on the character, etc.\n\nOVERALL: Overall I'd say this is a neat game. If you like Lord of the Rings or want an RPG that you won't spend 50+ hours running around in like Dragon Age or Skyrim, absolutely invest in this game, but I'd stick to buying it on a sale. This game is by no means remarkable. It isn't going to astound you with its story, blow you away with its soundtrack or voice acting, etc. It's a game that manages to ride right in the middle where you'll enjoy playing through it, maybe play it again with some friends, and then occasionally look at it as you scroll through your Steam library and think how much fun it would be to play Shadow of Mordor which sits right above it.\n\n","September 27, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It plays in the original LOTR world, with the original lore, original characters (you will meet the fellowship, Bilbo, etc, albeit only a few have the original voice actors). The plot and quests are believeable and fit nicely into the original LOTR plot.\nThe graphics are fine. Controls, too, which is a surprise, given it's a console port. Might want to take this as an example for other *coughDScough* games.\nThe Coop mode is nice and definitely upgrades the game's feeling. If just because the AI is horrible and needs to cheat the rules to actually be remotely useful.\n\nSo... it looks nice and has a nice story? You already noticed what's lacking? Jep, the gameplay.\nThe gameplay itself consists of running through linear levels, picking up loot, chests and secrets along the way, whilst slaugthering pile after pile of enemies with a few 'bosses' in between. Albeit those 'bosses' are often ridicolously weak, with the game's toughest points being the 'defend the gate' style horde attacks.\nWhich fades right into the next issue: The game is too easy. It comes with two further unlockable difficultys, but actually the game becomes only easier on the 2nd run, given you, by now, have a pretty well-skilled character who (if you know your numbers) is built towards synergizing mass slaughter. (Note that me and my mates got too bored of the game to try a 3rd run on the highest difficulty setting, but I don't expect things to change.)\nAs you can guess, inbetween nice (but boring once you know them from the first run) dialogues and repetitive slaughter is only boredome or exploring the map for glitches (floating trees are my favourite). The game definitely does not offer a lot of content.\nAs mentioned above, the AI (at least for your teammates in singleplayer) is lackluster, nuff said.\n\n\nEnd result? 6/10\nIt's fun to play once or twice, short enough for it'S repetitive melee system not to become boring, but not exactly an awesome game by any stretch. If you see it on a cheap sale (5@ and below sounds good) AND have someone to play it with, grab it. Otherwise, not really worth it.","September 4, 2014","true","24.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game combat system fits the standard of an ARPG and the critical strike system makes me feel satisfied when executing the enemies. However the boring skill tree and the repetition of missions and enemies kills my interest for this game. Mediocre acting and story. Moreover, the ability to swap character in the middle of the game is not a good thing as it decreases the replay value of the game.\nLinear gameplay makes the game feels boring. Basically there are fewer things to explore than I was expected.\nThe graphic is okay and fits the LOTR universe.\nThe multiplayer thing functions properly.\nGenerally, for a LOTR fan this game may be recommended to fill in the collection of LOTR nerds but I won't recommend this game for the masses.

This RPG is the latter.  The game menu is unintuitive and having to exit out of inventory everytime you search an enemy is a chore.  Voice acting is alright, but better for some characters than others.  The story is forgettable and you don't really form any kind of emotional attachment to the characters.  Enemies are what you'd expect, except there are a lot more trolls.  Good lord how I hated the trolls.  Also, there is a boss about halfway through that may have been bugged for me (or not) that took a good 5-10 minute of hacking at his legs to bring down.  I also expected that there would be more areas of the game to explore, as there are more locations on the map than you actually visit.  Apparently they are there to explain lore, but that should have been explicitly stated.

The parts I enjoyed the most were the concurrent story that takes place along with the story of the fellowship and the history that is easily accesible to learn more about Middle-Earth. Another great part of the game was the story and the empathy and true friendships you make through the story, and nothing will make you feel more than during the dwarven siege quest.

It's terrible console port and game was clearly made for casual console gamers. Even game menu is terrible - they had to think really hard, how to make it that bad and unusable.\nGraphics on maximum are awful, there are not many resolution settings, and what's funny, to enter option you have to first click Settings and then a menu shows... with only 1 option which is "OPTIONS", why? Same when you try to start the game - "You are attempting to run the game. Do you really want it? 1) Yes, start the game 2) No"\n\nHuman character looks like actor from a cheap movie, fortunately you can change that.\nDialogues are written very poorly, like game target was 10 yo children.\nControlling game with mouse is irritating - Y axis is less sensitive than X.\nThere are crates every-freaking-where, that you can destroy to get loot. It's like collecting beans in HARRY POTTER.\nWhen you run out of HP, your character starts crouching and enemies ignore you, even when you follow them.\nThere are tons of invisible walls - 1 step of stairs, but approached from wrong way? NO PASSAGE! Some rocks half of your height blocking the path - NO WAY.\n\nI'm a big LOTR fan and it's sad that most LOTR games are pure ♥♥♥♥. I don't know why people accept how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is. They give it a big + just because it's about Middle-Earth? Please don't do this, you are the reason they keep making such ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games.","October 5, 2014","false","1.5"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/32800/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","TLDR: Third Person hack/slash RPG similar to Dragon Age 2, but set in Tolkien’s Middle-Earth. Melee combat has a similar feel as the first Witcher game where you kind of need to flow from one hit to the next to build up strike power. The game appears to be built around multiplayer co-op, but I’ve only played single-player thus far. WARNING: If you have an ATI/AMD video card you will probably have technical trouble with this game. Big thumbs down for the game breaking bug (near the very end) - 2/10. Would have been 6/10 if the game actually worked.\n\nIf you liked Dragon Age 2 more than you liked Dragon Age Origins (not many people do) you might want to give Lord of the Rings: War in the North a try. The game is more linear and focused on combat than world-building. This might have to do with the fact that the “main story” is happening elsewhere (Fellowship of the Ring) and you’re just the distraction to help Frodo sneak into Mordor.\n\nYou play one member of a trio of adventurers at around the start of the first Lord of the Rings novel. Before Frodo, Aragorn, and their buddies start their journey to Mount Doom, Farin the dwarf (melee fighter), Eradan the ranger (archer), and Andriel the elf (mage) are fighting the good fight against the servants of the dark lord Sauron, who are led by a bad dude named Agandaur. Since Agandaur is Sauron’s right hand man fighting the bad fight in the north, your goal is to smash him and draw Sauron’s attention away from the south, where the Fellowship of the Ring are making their way into enemy territory.\n\nThe game is played in the third person perspective and while you can only play as one of the three characters at a time, you get opportunities to switch which character you’re playing between game chapters. Really though, you should probably stick with one character per playthrough because the game will auto assign the stats and skills of the characters you aren’t using when they level up, and you won’t get much opportunity to customize if you keep switching around. Unlike the Dragon Age games, you don’t control the whole team, just the guy you’re playing. Also, you’re controlling all your character’s attacks as well, not just designating a target.\n\nLike many hack and slash action RPG’s you run into a lot of loot and equipment in the game. You pretty much have as many equipment slots as Diablo 2, but most of the gear you find is “non-magical” and can be easily compared to similar pieces. This means there isn’t much in the way of randomly generated loot stats, and you don’t need to spend much time grinding for items. In fact, you probably shouldn’t even buy weapons from the vendors because chances are you’ll just find something better in about 10 minutes.\n\nPros:\n+Co-op gameplay available so you can go through the single player campaign with a friend or two. Each character has a unique “secret finding” skill that can only be used when a human is controlling the character (in single player, you only find secrets that your character can “see”) so if you have a full team of human players you can find all the secrets in a level. Also, bear in mind that like many squad based games, you can revive your allies if they’re knocked out. So you don’t need to spend too many healing potions if you know your buddy can just bring you back to life at full health.\n+Decent story that takes you all over Middle Earth (well, a lot of it) and involves some of the characters from the Lord of the Rings books/movies. Why don’t the eagles just fly everyone everywhere? Play the game and find out!\n\nCons:\n-This is the big one. If you have an AMD video card like I do (Radeon 7850) you will find the game has extremely poor frame rate at many places. I was unable to finish because at the last chapter, the game slowed to a crawl and would crash out repeatedly at the same place. Searching online, this seems to be a problem for a lot of people. My friend has an nVidia GPU and didn’t have this issue.\n-The “critical hit” system of the game can be fun sometimes but after a while it gets really repetitive. You built up power by continuously hitting a single enemy uninterrupted and eventually you can use a power attack with a chance of instantly killing them. Problem is, this means it takes like 2 minutes to kill many of the more powerful enemies, especially near the end of the game. Also, you only hit one enemy at a time no matter how wide your swings look, so attacking large groups of bad guys is really annoying (the little ankle-biters keep interrupting your combos against the big guys).\n-Despite how linear the game plays, it’s still possible to miss side quests because many of the quest items are randomly dropped. Cleared the whole area and didn’t find the special quest rock? Too bad for you, play through it again.\n-You can’t see the enemy’s life (except for bosses) and most bad guys seem to have a ton of life. This is probably intentional to force players to use the critical hit system more, but it means every fight seems artificially prolonged. Should it really take 50 hits to kill an orc?\n\nOverall, the game is fun (when it’s working) if you enjoy hack and slash and want to dive once again into Lord of the Rings lore, but there’s a lot of room for improvement. The fact that there are 3 playable character classes is reason for replay, but from what I’m told they’re mostly the same. If this game is in your backlog you should push it back in favor of something better, but it’s worth playing eventually: IF you have an nVidia graphics card. The game’s developers have abandoned the project so the crashing/low frame rate issues will not be fixed. The 90% of the game that I got to experience was sort of fun.\n","May 7, 2015","false","12.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I managed to get through Chapter 2, despite the crazy amount of frame drops, stuttering, crash to desktops, had to restart the computer a few times, etc. Chapter 8 though. I just can't do it. I manage to get to a part where I'm supposed to find a lever after travelling through a series of sewage pipes under a fortress and the game just freezes up after a crazy amount of stuttering and frame drops. Just not good optimization for AMD cards.\n\nThe game itself isn't bad. It's a fun action RPG in the Tolkein universe, so I was sold right away. You get to choose one of three characters, a man, a dwarf, and an elf. And you're not stuck with just that character, you can switch off in the main menu and continue from where you left off with any of the other characters. The combat is neat, but maybe a bit repetivie. The graphics are okay, but the character animation is pretty terrible. The combat animation, however, is actually great. The story isn't too compelling but you get to explore recognizable parts in the Tolkein universe as well as areas that have been mentioned but not necessarily explored in the novels or films. Basically, the plot involves the three characters banding together to fight off an evil force to the north while the Fellowship travels south towards Mordor.\n\nI should mention the gameplay as well. It's extremely linear. Basically, you enter an area which is counted as a "Chapter", and you continue along a path in that area in Middle-earth until the end of the Chapter. So it's not open world if that's what any of you wanted to know.\n\nIf you have an Nvidia card and are a Tolkein fan, this game is good fun for its duration.

NEAR THE END OF THE GAME IT WILL CONSTANTLY CRASH. *****\n\n^ I didn't know that before i start this game, so it dissapointed me.\n\nThe game itself is a casual RPG game, a nice way to spend an evening or two. Nothing special.\nIt's somewhat repetitive with the battles but nothing tragic. It's fun and simple.\n\nNot recommended for ATI users as well. Near the end it was literally unplayable because it was crashing constantly at Carn Dûm, stuttering and it was full of artifacts. I tried many guides with the hope it can be fixed, but nothing helped significantly. And some guides suggested to update bios or install older drivers. Of course i wouldn't go so far and put my self into such trouble for this game. I managed to complete it, by giving my save files to a friend of mine with nvidia so he could pass the point where my game was unplayable.\n\nAnyway, despite the terrible optimization, the game is okay, has okay graphics, it's a bit slow with the dialogs. Wouldn't spend money on it though, maybe when it is -85% off. If you have money and nvidia, take it.\n\n","May 11, 2015","false","19.9"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

However, various things deny that potential. 5 second knockdowns, your companions blocking your way, no flinching upon being hit resulting in just dropping dead, litte logic within the story line and to much a linear way to play.\n\nAlso, having to choose a single class and the game forcing you to play that class till the end of the game, since all the fancy equipment you gave to your AI companions will be gone when you select them. Making sure that once you change, you've got no way to match the equipment to that level, unless you buy yourself the equipment, which is only possible after  you've reached Rivendell.\n\nAll in all, if the devs payed some more time upon developing the game, it would've been recommendable and enjoyable. Now it's just a frustrating experience I must add. So, if you're looking for a decent Lord of the Rings slasher, I'd suggest playing the games made 10 years ago, or the somewhat newer Middle Earth: Shadows of Mordor.","November 1, 2014","false","11.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

Brilliant! We're bound to be GOTY already!"\n\nAnd the premise is good, it's basically LotR 9/11 and LotR Return of the Electric Boogaloo in terms of gameplay, but you're given three new characters with which to deal with, all of whom are as interesting as watching paint dry. The characters old and new are interacted with in a Mass Effect stylized conversation wheel, however, any and all choices you take don't cause any specific outcome, in fact, they make the game even worse.\nI don't know what it is about this game, but I imagine the voice actors were high as a kite when they did this gig, because they all have a rather monotonous demeanor to them, like they've just taken 10 second sleeping pills, and each second is slowly bringing them deeper into the realm of sleep and are trying to at least finish the conversation with you. The characters you can choose from are "Discount Gimli" Axe, Dwarf, same type of gurgled talking that sounds like the beard is to blame for his gargled speech. Then you have "Discount Aragorn" he has the exact same stance when it comes to fighting with a great sword, same footing and everything and for some reason, he seems to insist slowly looking more and more like aragorn slowly through the evolution of his armor. Finally, we have "Original character script 003921609" if you take a character editor, and click random, this is what you get, she's just as bland as her two companions, but just so happens to be the most useful, since she can create a sanctuary which protects from arrows, and heals.\nThe game has a certain feeling of Mass Effect to it, except the cover system was taken out, and a medieval weapon system was added, the characters feel heavier just like in Mass Effect. Your choices, if there are any last I remember, have no impact, conversations are struck up for a two minute conversation so you can find out how Gimli is feeling about the whole situation or if Galadriel just so happens to be on her rag (if only that were an actual question, I would give this game a full ten out of ten truth be told)\nBut instead, you're given lack luster questions to which you can respond in three different and sometimes two different manners, this has no outcome at all and is pretty much useless to even bother responding, you have more repercussions when you go to the doctor about a toy car up your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Rest in Peace Ryan, that still makes me laugh to this day)\nHonestly, the best part is the ending, because you're done, it's over, you get to stop playing, unless you're out for the achievements, in which case my sympathies.\nDon't get me wrong, this game is pretty fun when you have two other people to share the pain with, because misery loves company, but, alone, it's blank horror mixed with having to take breaks from feeling sick.","December 20, 2013","false","7.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Brilliant! We're bound to be GOTY already!"\n\nAnd the premise is good, it's basically LotR 9/11 and LotR Return of the Electric Boogaloo in terms of gameplay, but you're given three new characters with which to deal with, all of whom are as interesting as watching paint dry. The characters old and new are interacted with in a Mass Effect stylized conversation wheel, however, any and all choices you take don't cause any specific outcome, in fact, they make the game even worse.\nI don't know what it is about this game, but I imagine the voice actors were high as a kite when they did this gig, because they all have a rather monotonous demeanor to them, like they've just taken 10 second sleeping pills, and each second is slowly bringing them deeper into the realm of sleep and are trying to at least finish the conversation with you. The characters you can choose from are "Discount Gimli" Axe, Dwarf, same type of gurgled talking that sounds like the beard is to blame for his gargled speech. Then you have "Discount Aragorn" he has the exact same stance when it comes to fighting with a great sword, same footing and everything and for some reason, he seems to insist slowly looking more and more like aragorn slowly through the evolution of his armor. Finally, we have "Original character script 003921609" if you take a character editor, and click random, this is what you get, she's just as bland as her two companions, but just so happens to be the most useful, since she can create a sanctuary which protects from arrows, and heals.\nThe game has a certain feeling of Mass Effect to it, except the cover system was taken out, and a medieval weapon system was added, the characters feel heavier just like in Mass Effect. Your choices, if there are any last I remember, have no impact, conversations are struck up for a two minute conversation so you can find out how Gimli is feeling about the whole situation or if Galadriel just so happens to be on her rag (if only that were an actual question, I would give this game a full ten out of ten truth be told)\nBut instead, you're given lack luster questions to which you can respond in three different and sometimes two different manners, this has no outcome at all and is pretty much useless to even bother responding, you have more repercussions when you go to the doctor about a toy car up your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Rest in Peace Ryan, that still makes me laugh to this day)\nHonestly, the best part is the ending, because you're done, it's over, you get to stop playing, unless you're out for the achievements, in which case my sympathies.\nDon't get me wrong, this game is pretty fun when you have two other people to share the pain with, because misery loves company, but, alone, it's blank horror mixed with having to take breaks from feeling sick.","December 20, 2013","false","7.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

No seriously, like after the whole OMG its Aragon! OMG I can cut orks heads off and OMG most of the fellowship in rivendale, it just dies down to repetitive game and a character progression reminescent of skill trees of the old but half the size, yea no wonder it is just eh.\n\nIm not saying this game is bad and all but it is just not fun! I admit as a fan of the fantasy genre, I love Lord of the Rings, but this game is said to be a side, non-canon story, but it is still a good story none the less, and that is what pushed me to finish the game.\n\nIt is a standard hack and slash affair, but in this case, the controls feel sluggish and sometimes irresponsive, and I can see this is just a console port to PC. Also it doesnt help that every mob apart from 2 out of the 6 archetypes there are, will knock you down and make you immobile for a good 5 secs, which you wait for your character to stumble around and get up. Like the only 3 moves those 2 do will constantly knock you down and they are the most common of enemies in this game!\n\nThis game is definately not worth the amount it is asking for now, it is rentable at best from a video store for $1 or $2, whatever it is at your store, and the only reason why I got it on PC is cos it was in the Humble Bundle and I got it without a choice and I wanted FEAR.\n\nAlso did I mention that your team mates are solid and if you played single player like I did, they would stand there and be in your way and not move until after 3 seconds of running into them.

If you want this kind of experience, then go play that as a dual wielder. War In The North is a brand-riding money grab that's repetitve, boring, and has LoTR as it's one and only thing that anyone could possibly like this game. Srsly go read the wiki for the story, this game is not worth it.***\n\nThe one thing this game has going for it is the fact that it takes place in the LoTR universe. The aesthetics and the graphcs are mediocre, the voice acting is actually pretty good, but the game play is pretty bad.\n\nThe controls are unresponsive and wonky, the level design is not obvious, the enemies are repetitive and boring... I got to the part after the stream of sappers and was just too bored to continue. Oh look, I axed another one.

Because of that, I can't give you a good review. However, the reason that I was unable to play the game was because I was doing so with my friend, while talking over skype. However, the game decided that the best matter of course for this game was to force you to use steam voice chat, because it was certain that steam voice chat was better. There was no setting, nothing that you could change to alter this, so we were forced to use steam voice chat. That was fine, however the game also decided that, because it would "increase immersion" or whatever it thought, that it would change the properties of the microphone depending on the scenery.

If you want this kind of experience, then go play that as a dual wielder. War In The North is a brand-riding money grab that's repetitve, boring, and has LoTR as it's one and only thing that anyone could possibly like this game. Srsly go read the wiki for the story, this game is not worth it.***\n\nThe one thing this game has going for it is the fact that it takes place in the LoTR universe. The aesthetics and the graphcs are mediocre, the voice acting is actually pretty good, but the game play is pretty bad.\n\nThe controls are unresponsive and wonky, the level design is not obvious, the enemies are repetitive and boring... I got to the part after the stream of sappers and was just too bored to continue. Oh look, I axed another one. Oh wait, I'm the archer because I'm an idiot and they make you buy arrows instead of giving them to you. Let's be the mage..... aaaaand she's a healer.\n\nWhat the means is that this game is CLEARLY MEANT TO BE PLAYED AS THE DWARF. If I have to spend my money on arrows (because you do not find enough to not buy them), then my equipment is going to be lacking. I'll let the AI control that. If you're going to play a healer for NPCs then you're either too lazy to play and just want the story or you're too lazy to read the summary on Wiki. Either way, letting the computer shoot unlimited arrows and toss heals at you is really the only way it makes sense to play this game. I know this because the dwarf wa the last class I played and it was the only way I could even tolerate this game. I fought the troll as the Ranger... which basically meant I watched my teammates do Up-Downs like it's pre-season football.\n\nWhich really lends insight into this game. Why even have those other classes if they're so much less effective than the dwarf? Really, the entire game just seems like a brand-riding money grab to me. Even the death animations on the enemies are repetitive... The game really holds no new interesting thingsdo I fly in the face of Mostly Positive reviews? I don't really know, to be honest. This game is really just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dragon's Age: Origins, which came out a YEAR EARLIER.","September 9, 2015","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It cannot compete with the AAA titles with hand to hand combat and fantasy element, but it is good enough to be worth at least one play through. From the start it is evident that the developers put great effort into the game to make the environment shine with detail and realism. I was surprised to see such quality of level detail, despite the levels and gameplay being linear.\n\nThe character models and armor are very detailed as well. Every time you put newer more advanced pieces of armor it reflects on the model of your chosen character. Be it helmets, arm guards, leggings, body armor. All of it. It is also very accurate as far as movie content. Human, Elven, and Dwarven armor and items are what you'd have seen in the Lord of The Rings movies. It is not surprising since the publisher of the game is WB.\n\nPositives written above do not come without the negatives. Nearly every level, no matter how spectacular in appearance, has plenty of invisible walls. These invisible barriers can be incredibly frustrating because often you'd find yoruself checking whether you can go in a particular path only to find that it is simply blocked by an invisible wall. As is the case with even the best games on the market, the level design becomes less impressive, and often shows plain lazyness as the player reaches the 2nd half of the game, and eventually the ending. Some areas start looking less detailed and more rushed. Invisible walls become bigger, lighting less consistent, etc.\n\nWar in The North also has issues with inventory organization. You may eventually gather enough weapons or armor to fill all the alloted slots in the inventory. Some items can be old, other items too high for current level, and there is no way to organize them. Neither manually nor automatically. You cannot select an item and move it in the inventory. Player just ha sto move the cursor over the items to see the stats of each.\n\nAnother rather inconvenient drawback is in the design of the game for those who want to play single player as opposed to 3 player coop. You have the option to "give" your excess items or items meant for other two classes to your CPU controlled teammates. This is a very poor design gaffe because CPU does not  always equip the item gifted to them, nor compensate the party for the item value. Once it is given to a teammate controlled by the CPU the item is as good as gone.\nThis is not an issue if you play coop with 2 or three players. The other player actually gets the item and can use it. Similarly, when you play coop you can actually exchange items with each other to acquire complete sets of items meant to be worn together. They may be strangely acquired by your CPU partners, and when you switch characters between levels you may see the items that could complete your set on the other player you have picked to play as, but you are not able to either put it in any "shared chest" nor give to another player. Wasted opportunity.\n\nCombat is very satisfying and as the character levels up you have a wide choice of upgrades and moves and magic spells to pick from. The upgrade tree is very similar to that of Borderlands games in which you have three columns of skills which you invest points in to unlock the most powerful ones on the bottom. Once again, when you play single player you control your own player's upgrades, but the CPU manages them automatically and utilizes them in hit and miss fashion. Sometimes you'll see the Lore Master (Elf lady) use some of her very helpful spells often, other times you won't. Thankfully you can switch to another character midgame to experience their gameplay style. Whatever you upgrade them with and equipment you give them will be present again if you select them in the future, but not when CPU controls them.\n\nThe plot and the story is ok. It is not very impressive, but should be interesting to any fan of Tolkien universe or the Peter Jackson movies. The events take place at the same time as the Lord of The Rings three books. You encounter some characters mentioned in the books, get to visit iconic locations such as Lorien and get to talk to most of the main characters of LOTR. The cutscenes are very well animated, most of the time. Some cutscenes are just cheap fill ins where characters just stand there. Characters are voiced by quality voice acting, but unfortunately the same voice actors are recylced for many characters which feels very cheap. The main antagonist of the story does not impress too much because not much of their background or motivations are reveled to the player.\n\nThankfully and to benefit of those who just want to kill some orcs, goblins, urukhai, and whatever there is a survival mode available and at least 3 maps to play it on. You basically fight many waves of enemies. Pretty fun. After the main campaign is complete you are able to replay the game on Hero mode. This is actually pretty good because you can save up the "Gifts" that big characters give you upon completing their side quests. If you save the Gift for the Hero mode you will not get under powered items but instead get to choose a gift from high level items which goes all the way to level 40 or 50. Also replaying is fun if you play as one of other two characters. Each of them is fun to play because of pretty unique abilities and moves.","September 9, 2013","true","32.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JimmyPage666/recommended/32800/","JimmyPage666","JimmyPage666","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JimmyPage666/","252 products in account","Experience has usually left me very cautious whenever I see a licensed videogame, particularly when it’s tied in to a film franchise. It seems that virtually every blockbuster in the past 20 years has had an awful accompanying game aimed at cashing in on the hype surrounding the name. I’ve usually felt differently about the Lord of the Rings games because they’ve been pretty good (the tie-ins on the original Xbox were actually pretty great) so I approached this one with rather less cynicism than I’d usually reserve.\n\nIt’s immediately obvious that this isn’t a high quality, high budget title. The cast impersonators are the first clue and every member of the original cast that appears in the game has an actor that sounds not-quite like what we’re used to hearing. The crude visuals, basic soundtrack and the sense that they’ve hired one voice actor to cover every other NPC were a little disappointing, though not enough to be off-putting.\n\nSo, yet another 3rd person hack ‘n’ slash, this one with the most basic of plots; “that guy is Sauron’s mate, let’s kill him”. Obviously, being a mate of Sauron he’s quite powerful and has many orcs between him and your party, so you’ve got to kill them off first. The plot is as simple as that. On the way you encounter some of the characters shown in the films, as well as some only mentioned in the books, (minor spoilers, though it’s not like the story here is that important!)  such as Gwaihir, Elladan and Elrohir, Radagast the Brown and Halbarad the Ranger.\n\nLevels are very simple, with three or four stages to each level and a peaceful base every few levels where you can return to repair, buy and sell items and turn in quests at occasional checkpoints. You won’t spend very long there though; the main part of the game is either chopping up orcs or running towards the next lot of orcs to chop up.\n\nGameplay is very repetitive and, though the combat is very functional, it gets quite dull as you go from one stage to the next doing the same bloody thing over and over. Combat is quite a standard affair, with standard fast and heavy attacks melee attacks, a ranged attack and the options to block and dodge. The controls are functional and work well enough, but everything feels quite floaty and a little detached. Each character has unique abilities that can be unlocked and upgraded as the character levels up, most of which are pretty cool to execute. The problem is in how repetitive it becomes as you take on endless hordes of a very unvaried enemy. I often compare these types of games to God of War, but there’s a reason for that; in those games, there are dozens of various attack types and there’s a huge variety of enemy types, all of which require different tactics to combat. In this case, War in The North has 4 basic enemy types – a melee guy, a ranged guy, a sorcerer and a troll. Sure, there are technically more, with goblins, Uruk Hai and so on, but all they really are is the same thing with better stats – which doesn’t mean anything as they are only encountered later in the game when your own stats have also grown massively. This effectively means that you’re fighting the same group of things in a sequence of different rooms for the entire campaign, broken up by the occasional mediocre boss battle and combat is broken down to a sequence of dodge, attack, dodge, special attack for the entire campaign. Not exactly Ride to Hell, but hardly a prize winning game either.\n\nVisually the game plays it safe, using the same design aesthetic as in the films, although without any of the grand scenery or set pieces that I loved about the trilogy. The settings are familiar and just a little bland, but it does the job. It’s in the graphics that the game shows its limitations, especially in the resolution and framerate. This game looks like a last-gen console port and even running at 1080p it doesn’t look like it’s in HD. Framerate is similar, even though FRAPS showed it running at a solid 60fps it certainly didn’t look like anything approaching that, in fact it felt like 20. I don’t know why everything looked so poor, or why the framerate randomly dropped to 2fps for a few seconds at random, or why the last level is so glitched you have to reinstall 2 year old drivers for your GPU to run the sodding thing, but it’s very poor form and quite infuriating. That these issues haven’t been patched, despite the forums being flooded with various technical issues, is pretty disgraceful.\n\nWar in the North is one of those licensed games that get a recommendation because it’s “good enough”. If, like me, you’re a fan of The Lord of the Rings, you’ll probably enjoy going toe-to-toe with a horde of orcs and just being in Middle Earth. The game almost loses my recommendation due to the technical issues and game breaking bugs and if you don’t want to ♥♥♥♥ about fixing it yourself then I’d advise you to steer well clear. If you’re fine with that, it’s a pretty decent distraction for a few hours.\n\nMy score:\n\n6/10\n\nIt’s a good enough game; quite repetitive, and pretty average combat, but it’s a good amount of fun carving through a mass of orcs.\n","August 22, 2014","true","28.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Large enemies such as trolls require me to use the combat roll to get out of the way, and I actually have to ration my health potions. The game does have some combat abilities (such as power hits that are on a cooldown), but I personally don't use them very much.\n\nThe companion AI is very well done. I've noticed one companion position herself so that her spells benefit both me and the other AI, instead of just spamming her abilities off in a corner somewhere.\n\nThe armor system in the game is relatively interesting. I find myself actually comparing stats on armor and looking for gems to boost my armor's base stats. I also have to be careful with my funds so I can afford good armor upgrades when I find them on shopkeepers.\n\nThe game IS linear. At times, I have felt an almost on-rails feeling, but other times it's surprisingly open. The game has a lot of hidden chests and caches that encourage exploring every corner of the map. The items from these caches are typically very useful.\n\nThe game has many side-quests that are typically optional. You may revisit quest hubs in the world to complete these side quests at your leisure.\n\nI'm not a fan of the Lord of the Rings, but even I got into the story.

The combat is simple but every kill feels rewarding. As you run through orcs and goblins drenched in their blood you can't help but to feel some adrenaline. The story, being set in Middle Earth, is just what you'd expect from the universe of Tolkien. The established locations like Bree and Imladris are nice to look at but the never before seen areas add to immense size of Middle Earth.

Every time you put newer more advanced pieces of armor it reflects on the model of your chosen character. Be it helmets, arm guards, leggings, body armor. All of it. It is also very accurate as far as movie content. Human, Elven, and Dwarven armor and items are what you'd have seen in the Lord of The Rings movies. It is not surprising since the publisher of the game is WB.\n\nPositives written above do not come without the negatives. Nearly every level, no matter how spectacular in appearance, has plenty of invisible walls. These invisible barriers can be incredibly frustrating because often you'd find yoruself checking whether you can go in a particular path only to find that it is simply blocked by an invisible wall. As is the case with even the best games on the market, the level design becomes less impressive, and often shows plain lazyness as the player reaches the 2nd half of the game, and eventually the ending. Some areas start looking less detailed and more rushed. Invisible walls become bigger, lighting less consistent, etc.\n\nWar in The North also has issues with inventory organization. You may eventually gather enough weapons or armor to fill all the alloted slots in the inventory. Some items can be old, other items too high for current level, and there is no way to organize them. Neither manually nor automatically. You cannot select an item and move it in the inventory. Player just ha sto move the cursor over the items to see the stats of each.\n\nAnother rather inconvenient drawback is in the design of the game for those who want to play single player as opposed to 3 player coop. You have the option to "give" your excess items or items meant for other two classes to your CPU controlled teammates. This is a very poor design gaffe because CPU does not  always equip the item gifted to them, nor compensate the party for the item value. Once it is given to a teammate controlled by the CPU the item is as good as gone.\nThis is not an issue if you play coop with 2 or three players. The other player actually gets the item and can use it. Similarly, when you play coop you can actually exchange items with each other to acquire complete sets of items meant to be worn together. They may be strangely acquired by your CPU partners, and when you switch characters between levels you may see the items that could complete your set on the other player you have picked to play as, but you are not able to either put it in any "shared chest" nor give to another player. Wasted opportunity.\n\nCombat is very satisfying and as the character levels up you have a wide choice of upgrades and moves and magic spells to pick from. The upgrade tree is very similar to that of Borderlands games in which you have three columns of skills which you invest points in to unlock the most powerful ones on the bottom. Once again, when you play single player you control your own player's upgrades, but the CPU manages them automatically and utilizes them in hit and miss fashion. Sometimes you'll see the Lore Master (Elf lady) use some of her very helpful spells often, other times you won't. Thankfully you can switch to another character midgame to experience their gameplay style. Whatever you upgrade them with and equipment you give them will be present again if you select them in the future, but not when CPU controls them.\n\nThe plot and the story is ok. It is not very impressive, but should be interesting to any fan of Tolkien universe or the Peter Jackson movies. The events take place at the same time as the Lord of The Rings three books. You encounter some characters mentioned in the books, get to visit iconic locations such as Lorien and get to talk to most of the main characters of LOTR. The cutscenes are very well animated, most of the time. Some cutscenes are just cheap fill ins where characters just stand there. Characters are voiced by quality voice acting, but unfortunately the same voice actors are recylced for many characters which feels very cheap. The main antagonist of the story does not impress too much because not much of their background or motivations are reveled to the player.\n\nThankfully and to benefit of those who just want to kill some orcs, goblins, urukhai, and whatever there is a survival mode available and at least 3 maps to play it on. You basically fight many waves of enemies. Pretty fun. After the main campaign is complete you are able to replay the game on Hero mode. This is actually pretty good because you can save up the "Gifts" that big characters give you upon completing their side quests. If you save the Gift for the Hero mode you will not get under powered items but instead get to choose a gift from high level items which goes all the way to level 40 or 50. Also replaying is fun if you play as one of other two characters. Each of them is fun to play because of pretty unique abilities and moves.","September 9, 2013","true","32.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sure there are "better" coop experience out there, but that's not a reason to give this game a mediocre review. >:( I hate that type of review approach. I played all the coop games, and I would have enjoy the hell out of this one if I hadn't trusted the reviews. My bad.\n\nBut the game is great! It starts in a tavern! The combat system works so well you can really see and understand everything that is going on, hitting feels good and you don't want to get hit either so difficulty is well balanced. Bringing a Troll down is always satisfying. Characters looks good, graphics are veeeery polished (glittering snow and it just feels cold!) I found the cinematic storytelling much more polished and less awkward than Mass Effect and Skyrim combined.\n\nWe were 3 friends playing in LAN and it was 8 hours straight, forget to eat style of gaming event. I wouldn't pay 59$ for it  but not it's a very high value product IMHO. Not astoundingly great but just so so good, hits the right points. The UI is fast and simple, you very rarely get overencumbered, interaction between players is a lot of fun, you can really support one another in the heat of the action. The backgrounds are often breath taking honnestly, we just sat there admiring the view while smoking a joint. There is a lot of meat on that bone so for us it became a coop classic.\n\nSo the morale is having a tough competition doesn't necessarly make a game bad. Lesson learned.","November 18, 2014","true","12.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Few ingame glitches, though so minor that they aren't even worth mentioning.\n\nEntertaining combat and lots of good voice acted NPCs to talk to!

The game could of been harder, people are saying it needs co-op... Honestly... That's what this game lacks. This was a big let down for me as I have played other LOTR games that were much better than this... It seems they whipped up the story line as fast as they could, the acting was horribly done and the story was far too breif. The action combat style of the game was the only thing good about it. However, the AI was dumber than previous LOTR games. I would of loved to give this game a great review, but it didn't quite reach my expectations as a LOTR game.\n\nSure you take a good amount of damage if you're hit, which is why people probably find this game moderatly hard, but honestly, that's all it was. They hit you hard, and harder on higher difficulties. The AI did not get smarter, just simply, your health pool took more damage. So if you know how to strike and move, this game is beyond easy...\n\nSo mainly what I'm disliking the game for is...\n\n1. Dumb AI\n2. Very breif storyline\n3. Extremely easy\n4. (Just throwing this out there) I expected more mobs. There wasn't that many to fight, and they came in small waves that were easily controlled.\n\nWhat's good about the game?\n\n1.

If you've sene the movies more than once, nothing in this game will make any sense. If you've read the books more than once, you'll be shouting at Aragorn, Gandalf, Elrond, etc every every time they're on-screen because they make absolutely no attempt to make them anything like the characters in the book or the movie.\n\nThis is a mediocre hack-and-slash that has the great fortune of being named "Lord of the Rings." Otherwise, it wouldn't have sold many copies.\n\nThe fight mechanics are boring, the archery is clumsy, and the equipment treadmill is just tiring. Srsly? I'm going to go to Rivendell, and the elf at the smithy is going to charge me for repairs?\n\nMost of the loot you'll get in this game is arrows or money, both of which the game would have been much better off without. There is so much ammunition hidden in jars that it's just stupid to make me keep track of it at all. In the first three missions (probably four or five hours of game time), I've run out of arrows once.\n\nBut really, there's not much point to ever firing an arrow. There's apparently a headshot mechanic, but in order to score a headshot, you still have to shoot a big orc in the head four or five times to reduce his HP.\n\nThis game is a solid D. If it wasn't a Lord of the Rings game, it would be a D+. But it is, so it's absolutely bursting with references to lore and history that play absolutely no part in the story whatsoever. But you can't be certain what's going to be important or might trigger something later on, so you click through every single dialogue.\n\nWhat a piece of ♥♥♥♥.

It's an unpolished and lazy attempt to cash in on the success of the movie releases.  You play one of a party of 3 characters that spend the entire game one or two steps away from the ringbearers. One of the first areas is Bree, where you meet up with Aragorn who's waiting on Gandalf and Frodo.  After you finish the quest, they've made their way through the town.  We all know how the storyline of the novels runs and the constant "Oh, you just missed the really cool characters but you helped them on their journey... I promise" gets boring quickly.\n\nIt is a poor console port.  The engine has not aged well, and it shows.  Despite the beautiful lands in LotR, the brown filter that is more commonly seen in FPSs makes the graphics look even worse than they actually are.  I am not someone that expects Crysis-like graphics in every video game, but this is painfully dated.  There is no way to change any networking settings (not that I expected them to be there) and this is a pain in the ♥♥♥ on a PC release.  You can't specify whether to use LAN or WAN though it does appear to function on both.  There is no way to turn off the voice chat, and it is SO laggy.  Playing with my partner over LAN in the next room had a good 3000~ms latency on the VoiP.\n\nI love RPGs, I love hack n slashers, and I quite enjoy the LotR story.  I can put up with bad writing if the gameplay is fun, and vice versa.  I've got countless hours wasted in these sorts of games.  Unfortunately, there isn't much substance to hold any interest in this game whatsoever, and completely unimmersive.\n\nTL;DR.  Crap LotR action RPG that I'm glad I got in a Humble Bundle instead of paying full price.  Not even whacky co-op shenanigans could make this fun.","December 5, 2013","false","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A game great for looting with your best buddys. You can play 3 different classes and races for that. Ranger, Chapion and Lore-master, all having their own skill trees, their own weapons (just the bows and staf), their own special armoring. A little variaton of enemies but passable. Not even a shalow ARPG but fun no matter. Just don't buy it at full price, wait for it to be below normal summ.\n\nI would recommend War in the North if only it had not crashed on my 2nd run trough it, at the very last chapter and guess what, it left me with no save files. That's right, it completely deleted my save game files. Afterwards I cheekt forums for answers and the game supposedly does that. When you might ask, when ever it feels like, so my hours spent enyoing War where completely wiped.\nSo, great time with the game, but specifically one little crash made me unlike this avareg but decent work. Because the rights has been sold from SnowblindStudios the game will not be patched and save files will be lost(mark my words).

I powered through a very bad bug in chapter 2 of the game that would have it randomly crash, took about 3 hours to pass a single section that should of took about 20 minutes, twice crashing seconds before triggering the saving in the game.\n\nMost of the times it crashes it doesn't crash to desktop it blue screens my computer most of the time not giving a reason just something failed and the memory address of all “0”s and an x or 5 thrown in.\n\nI have made it through chapter 7 with it crashing about every half hour and now in chapter 8 of the game I found another section that will crash every few minutes similar to chapter 2 of the game.  Now I have to quit.\n\n\n\n\nThe actual review of the game (based on when it is not crashing)\none of the first things you get is a bird friend and you hit the 4 button to call for his aid.  Well the Elf character has a power that has you block and hit 4 (holding CTRL then hit 4).  even though the 4 icon has changed from the bird logo to a different logo, BOTH powers are used; the bird and area heal.  I wasted a lot of bird power trying to keep the other 2 friends alive.\n\n\nDefense missions are the worst part, it goes fine until the enemy brings in the giant troll and he walk past you not caring that you are attacking him and then kills the thing you are protecting in 15 seconds.\n\nI personally am more of a dodger power and like to dodge and not much blocking, I would of liked a double dodge (I only played the elf so I do not know if the other characters have a double dodge).  After facing a double sword enemy who is stabbing you so much that you can not dodge, I have learned to block against them just be for they attack and then attack them back.\n\nDialog was interesting even had a few points that you could try to tell some one that we are just passing through this very remote area to get to grandma's house (not exactly G ma’s house, but you are lieing about what you are doing so I thought it appropriate) and the NPC has non of that, but a very interesting choice to tell them.  Also there is a lot of repeat dialog choices that are represented as new choices.  Example: someone tells you of a castle; new option of the castle in dialog choices, npc just repeats the thing that brought up the new choice.\n\n\n\nCombat was fun and interesting, slowly adding in new enemies over the 6 chapter's I played.  I would of loved to see how the ending turned out and if they kept adding new enemies through the end, but sadly the bugs and crashing my computer is enough to make me stop.","March 10, 2014","false","17.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The amazing reviews ons team are most likely because the only people who will buy this game are already avid LOTR fans. I however, was not a fan beforehand and will deliver a serious review.\n\nHere's a complied list, and at the end of the list I'll let you be the judge of whether or not you wish to dive into this game\n\nIs the story any good?\nAbsolutely, as any RPG you have the freedom to partake in the story or to skip it and get into the action. Talking to the villagers of every town will get you side quests in which you can earn some intense gear.\n\nIs the combat any good?\nPersonally, the combat is pretty repetetive, but it does allow for some customizing, much like dragon age.\n\nIs there customization?\nThe customization is limited but it IS there, which is better than no customization. Note: You may only customize AFTER starting the game.\n\nDiversity?\nYes, you're able to pick one of the three heros and go along with it, there's also multiplayer functions so you can bring two friends and each have their own hero.\n\nAll of these things are good, so why is this a downvote?\nThere is only one bad quality, but you must realize the depth of the how terrible it is to understand why it's a thumbs down.\n\nWhat is wrong with it?\nThe game crashes OFTEN. This game was released on Nov. 1, 2011 which wasn't too long ago. Yet, the game runs like it was made in 2002, with how the graphics are I originally thought this game was made in 2006.\n\nMy computer is really new, and it is capable of running Bioshock infinite on max settings, yet it cannot run LOTR War in the North for over an hour without crashing. What's more, is that it does not simply crash the game/window/application. It crashes the ENTIRE DESKTOP.\n\nTHIS IS WHY THE GAME RECIEVED A LOW METASCORE, IT IS INCREDIBLY UNSTABLE. It is borderline unplayable, because up until the undead level, you don't really have any problems with crashing. but the second you get to the undead mobs, the game cannot control it's own software and seeminglye xplodes upon itself. And, because the undead levels are canon, you MUST pass through them. I was lucky because my computer was new, so I had a long grace period before it killed itself, but any run of the mill computer may not be able to handle it at all.\n\nAll in all, this was a great game, if it wasn't so cancerous to it's own programming, I as a person who is not a die-hard fan of LOTR can honestly say this would have recieved an 85-95 score for what it brings to the table. However, an amazing game CANNOT HAVE A FOUNDATION MADE SUITABLE ONLY FOR GAMES 5 YEARS BEHIND ITS TIME.","July 25, 2014","false","36.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I played previous SnowBlind games, but I'm not a Lord of the Rings fan at all. But what I played of the used copy convinced me to pay it forward so to speak. I went back to Gamestop and changed it in for a real copy and paid the exta money. I very much enjoyed the game when I played it on the 360. I thought the combat was fun as well as the archery. I don't play the mage class so I can't say anything about that. I enjoy open world games the best. Like The Elder Scrolls and Grand Theft Auto. Fallout and what not. This game gives a slight feeling of open world but it does give you direction. And people will like that also. Not knowing what to do in a game is not fun.\n\nThe difficulty seems fair. I'm not that great at video games, and found normal a fun, fair challenge.\n\nI will soon find out if the xbox 360 controller works for this game. The controller worked fine! Nice.\n\nSo this is the 2nd time buying this game. Even though I played it twice on the 360. Warrior and Rouge class. Very fun.\n\nI played co op with my cousin on Xbox Live. I think we played through the whole game. But I can't remember for sure. Very fun game to play with a friend.\n\nIt's fun co op or single player!

Intro music for our band of stalwart heroes, a human ranger, a dwarf fighter and an elven wizard(the only woman of course), who set out from the Prancing Pony at Bree, a place cursed with being drenched in perpetual rainy nights, after receiving instructions from non other than stapper, which is the Dutch translation for the nickname for Aragorn, who in this game looks remarkably like an actor called Viggo Mortensen.\n\nThe going is pretty unidirectional from the start. Stop the main bad guy Agandaûr from intervening with the rest of the world by killing him dead until he is. Easy enough. In between Bree and Agandaûr's grave you meet some critters that are in the way, but that is how this game should be. They consists of nasty orcs and goblins, undead, biggers orcs, very big trolls, a huge giant even, humans in all shapes and sizes, spiders small, large and very large and that is about it really.\nAt various moments you get helped by token people you can do well without. At least they don't die on you most of the time, which saves you from that headache. The coolest thing around is however the giant eagle friend your team gains, which gives a nice air asset that you can throw against some of the bigger nasties, provided they are in the open and you didn't waste your limited supply of airstrikes on something smaller.\n\nSomewhere in between you make a stopover at Rivendell where you are briefed by someone who looks remarkably like the actor Hugo Weaving. Incidently Hugo doesn't even hush up the fact that Frodo has a powerful ring that needs to be destroyed. So far for secrecy.\nYou get to speak to other actors too, like Orlando Bloom, Ian Holm, John Rhys-Davies, Elijah Wood and Liv Tyler and yes by now you know the game takes its cues from the Peter Jackson movies. It isn't bad but it isn't very original either.\n\nAnd that might be the overall theme of this game. It isn't really bad, but it isn't really good either.. It is okayies. A word I just invented for this purpose. For instance; to lengthen your game experience they threw in a truckload of containers for you to plunder. You have to loot them all cause that is the only way to get neat new gear and what you find is pretty random. So there you are, hero of the war of the north, defeater of many a container...for you destroy or open more caskets, caches, barrels and other containers than you ever want too, because you will not only need to find loot for your own character, but also for your ai buddies, who might have no use at all for that stuff as far as can be told, but maybe they do or at least you can sell the stuff so you buy better stuff for you own, but most of all because this game is meant to be a co-op and can't quite figure out that you play it as a single player or as a co-op.\n\nYour ai buddies require some hand-holding for them not to be killed and if you are the elven maiden wizard it is doubly up to you to make sure that your ai buddies don't get killed, for the wizard biggest task is preventing the other two from turning into pin cushions.\n\nThe overwhelming sensation you get when proceeding through this game is: if they just had.. If they just had added some more variety. If they just had added some more ways to do the quests.. If they just had added some more options in character development. If they just had added some interesting side quests. If they had just added some meaning full conversations.\n\nThe biggest surprise is at the end when you discover that after all is said and done and the dead are buried and the living celebrate, you still are only halfway developed. And why? Cause you can then redo the whole game again on a higher difficulty level and gain more levels. Oh wow..\n\nWar in the North is amusing enough to do once, but it totally lacks the charm to play once more, even as a different character. It is after all only okayies","October 1, 2015","true","22.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's... it.\n\nYou control one of three characters with no personality or character development trying to chain as many finishers as possible, until you unlock Farin's Explosive Arrow and trivialize the game. Even the only vaguely challenging sections, which are the optional horde challenge maps. Along the way you will meet other fan-favorite characters such as the Fellowship, but then you will discover they have about as much relevance to you as this game does to Tolkein's legendarium. Sorry, Lord of the Rings fans.\n\nYour mission is to go kill the leader of Sauron's forces in the North, Agandaur. He is pathetically easy, but it's worth it (?) to see the CGI animation that probably ate up 70% of the budget for this game.\n\nThe only way this game becomes decent is if you somehow game one, preferably two, friends into playing it with you. The time commitment shouldn't be that bad because the game is both easy and short. Playing with friends helps disguise some of the game's more egregious single-player faults, such as an incredibly limited inventory system, no ability to switch between characters on the fly (this requires you to completely reload the game), and the fact that some parts of the game are straight-up inaccessible without two or more players.\n\nFortunately the game isn't super glitchy (there are some glitches but reloading usually fixes it) or unplayable, and you'll probably unlock 95% of the achievements without even trying.\n\nSadly, War in the North failed to live up to any of its promise. It's not a HORRIBLE game by any means, but there are way better uses of your time.","June 14, 2015","false","35.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I had finished this game on my friend's Xbox 360 only months before and enjoyed playing it with him in Co-op mode. After finshing this game on my PC I realised how boring and repetitive the game really was. The game is not a free-roaming or exploring type. It restricts you to the very bone with it's story levels, which are the only things that you can actually do in this game. Sure, myself being a huge Tolkien fan should enjoy this game a lot, but the lore is barely touched on. There are refrencing to the movies and books but no huge give away of what the game/story is actually about to all new-comers. If your looking for a Middle-Earth game with heaps of lore and factual basings on Tolkien's work, please, please buy Shadow of Mordor. I did so on my Xbox One, and have to say, it's probably one of my favourite games of all time.","March 13, 2015","false","36.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The levelling and talent trees are lackluster, the HUD during gameplay is incomprehensible, and the combat is sloppy.\n\nStory - Yes, it's set in Middle-Earth, and they have gotten a lot of the names of people/places directly from the lore, but that doesn't make the story actually interesting.  Essentially, you are a small band of adventurers (a man, an elf and a dwarf, super original) that need to distract Sauron's forces from the ringbearer during the time of the LOTR trilogy.

And then I get to trade this Worn Sword for a Worn Sword +1, how delightful. And I can use all the health potions in one gulp if I am close to death. What's that? There's a giant magic eagle, and he talks? Why yes, video game, I think huffing paint is a good idea.

I'm going to list the good and the bad that I've encountered so far in a list of bullet points and then expand on them later so that it doesn't get too TL;DR.\n\nGOOD:\n*  Fun action gameplay\n*  Interestingly well done facial models based off the actors from the movies - (though not mocapped or anything)\n*  Decent amount of gameplay hours\n\nBAD:\n*  Terrible console port\n*  No way to differentiate LAN from internet multiplayer (it does work with LAN, just doesn't give any network information)\n*  Painful 'story' attempting to garner interest from the fanboys\n*  Ugly, ugly graphics\n*  Unimmersive sound\n*  No way to toggle off voice chat\n\nThis game hurts to play.  It's an unpolished and lazy attempt to cash in on the success of the movie releases.  You play one of a party of 3 characters that spend the entire game one or two steps away from the ringbearers. One of the first areas is Bree, where you meet up with Aragorn who's waiting on Gandalf and Frodo.  After you finish the quest, they've made their way through the town.  We all know how the storyline of the novels runs and the constant "Oh, you just missed the really cool characters but you helped them on their journey... I promise" gets boring quickly.\n\nIt is a poor console port.  The engine has not aged well, and it shows.  Despite the beautiful lands in LotR, the brown filter that is more commonly seen in FPSs makes the graphics look even worse than they actually are.  I am not someone that expects Crysis-like graphics in every video game, but this is painfully dated.  There is no way to change any networking settings (not that I expected them to be there) and this is a pain in the ♥♥♥ on a PC release.  You can't specify whether to use LAN or WAN though it does appear to function on both.  There is no way to turn off the voice chat, and it is SO laggy.  Playing with my partner over LAN in the next room had a good 3000~ms latency on the VoiP.\n\nI love RPGs, I love hack n slashers, and I quite enjoy the LotR story.  I can put up with bad writing if the gameplay is fun, and vice versa.  I've got countless hours wasted in these sorts of games.  Unfortunately, there isn't much substance to hold any interest in this game whatsoever, and completely unimmersive.\n\nTL;DR.  Crap LotR action RPG that I'm glad I got in a Humble Bundle instead of paying full price.  Not even whacky co-op shenanigans could make this fun.","December 5, 2013","false","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That said, there's several annoying bugs to be wary of. The game forces you to use Steam Voice in co-op, which is counter-intuitive in the likely scenario that you're already using a better form of voice communication. The game crashes frequently in graphically intensive situations, and this is a commonly reported issue for AMD card owners with post-HD5k era GPUs. The aggregate score of 66 seems fitting, as those looking for this type of game should enjoy it if they're willing to tolerate its issues.
