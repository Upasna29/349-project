Remember the fun it was to build your own custom ships on games like Master of Orion? GTB is a tower defense game that's like that for every single unit or turret. From the smallest cheap gun to the big strongholds, from inexpensive recruit infantry to heavily shielded mechs.\n\nDesigning the units is simple, but the management of new and older designs can be a little busywork. But this kind of complexity that usually lacks on modern games is very welcomed.\n\nThe very fact that this games plays as both a traditional tower defense game and an inverted tower defense game is a testimony to its flexibility. It's a robust selection of units with great variation of strategies you can use to beat the enemy.\n\nAt least for me, the fact that you can design, customize and name every unit in the field adds to the enjoyment and creates a very fun experience when your guys are winning a battle. It's just most interesting when that tank unit you built to be fast and strong barely makes it to the finish line.\n\nBuilding units is not everything, and the battles are intense and complex.\n\nApart from the built-in campaign, you can edit your own scenarios, and upload and download challenges from other users.\n\nIf you like Tower Defense games or games with customization, this is a very good choice.","March 1, 2014","true","40.5"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","1"

While the game can be a bit slow at times, it's rarely tedious or boring. The fact that you can change each unit's module allows you to specialize units, such as an expensive death machine or cheap units focusing on speed, damage, or a middling blend. Furthermore, while the shield-armor system (and those being better dealt with by ballistic and energy weapons respectively) isn't anything new, it just adds to the amount of thought that has to go into what units you make and in what order you deploy them.\n\nThe game may get a bit formulaic (I've found an effective strategy to consistenyl be a "conga line of victory", wherin it's just a constant stream of tanks/mechs and supply trucks with repair truck escorts, and burning any extra supply on random units like medium tanks or soldiers for other paths), but it's still fun.","October 24, 2014","true","35.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

GSB did feel like that at first but i think what kept me playing that is because i was able to distinguish better what worked and what didnt. With GTB however, it feels more like, "spam more than the enemy can handle" kind of game.\n\nWhen i tested out my own custom units as an attacker, i did win, but i couldn't quite make out how i did with what designs were effective and it felt like it was just all about spamming faster than the enemy can place its units down. I did see a couple of units really stand out but that was all i was able to take in and didn't feel as if they made a real impact to the game and was more about having more guns than my enemy to break through their defences.\n\nAs the defender, different story, after a solid 40mins of deciding what to put in my turrets and so forth i used them in battle, but it seems as though my theory of "the spammier the better" really came to fruitition as my enemy was constiantly fielding units that eventually meant i couldnt keep up with stopping the flow with the supplies i needed. I admit, i may have made classical n00b errors, such as not using the speed settings to help me better make sense of the battle (D'oh), and i noticed how most of my turrets were fitted into Anti-Armor roles. Maybe i just need to go back to the drawing board like i did with GSB, but honestly, after playing a few games of what felt like "the spammier the better", i saw no point and scrapped all of my turret designs.\n\nYou see with Space Battles i was able to figure out roughly where i went wrong if i lost a battle. Sometimes it was a design that ended up being obsolete with enemy designs or not being able to fill the role i intend it to. But with Tank Battles it didn't feel like that at all. It felt more like all of my units were at fault and the unit stats at the end did nothing to help me at all. I just couldn't make sense of all the information being given to me.\n\nThough as i said at the beginning, i probably suck and need to put more time into this game for its goodness to really shine, but it felt like a real dissapointment from its Space counterpart, and besides, i have never been one for Tower Defence style games anyway as i always find the genre having little strategy and mainly focusing on who spams best. Tank Battles seems to be the same story then as always for me, just with customisation of units being a nice feature to it all.\n\n5/10. A game that looked promising along with the customisation features but maybe that is due to my love of its space daddy counterpart. Overall, i am dissapointed, hope i can come back to this and it convinces me to change my mind.\n\nIf you love TD games, this may be for you but may not be exactly your cup of tea, and all the customisation and info that this game bombards you with may put you off in the end, aside from that, i advise you save your £6.99 (£11.98 with the DLC included) for a rainy day and look elswere.\n\nAnd as for me, i am off to play GSB in order to cheer myself up by blowing alien ships up for no apparent reason, at least i can make sense out of all the chaos...oh well...\n\n*readies plasma cannons* toodles.","January 10, 2015","false","4.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

It comes with a 12 mission campaign right off the bat and coupled with the ability to attack or defend (two modes of play which feel like entirely different experiences in themselves) you’ve got essentially 24 missions before you go anywhere near the game's extensive customisation options. Between the unit and level editor, the built-in online challenge sharing and the adaptive AI that's capable of wielding your own designs against you, there’s a potentially limitless amount of content on offer here.

If you love making customized units that you can later on watch in combat, then this is a game for you. As for gameplay, I can describe this one as a combination of Close Combat series (the top down camera style reminded me of those games) and Anomaly Warzone series.\n\nThe thing that I loved the most is that you can create your own units based on a variety of hulls, and once your'e done with the campaign maps, you can go and play any map that other players have created. You can even create your own maps and upload them so that everyone can give them a try.\n\nI am not saying this game is a triple A quality title, but it's a really neat and well presented indie product that can give you many hours of fun, and it definitely earned a rating of at least 75%. When you look at some mindless and pointless games that have been awarded with 90+ by the Steam community (Goat Simulator being one of those) you can only begin to question how ignorant the community is nowadays, but trust the gaming veterans like me and get this game, you won't regret it.

The ability to customize every unit with all sorts of components and augmentations is a tweaker builders paradise. Reminds me of the fun i used to have designing battlemechs for the board game version of Fasa's BATTLETECH back in the 1980s and 90s. When designing new tanks, mechs, troops, turret defenses etc you have to observe how each one effects the other. You may design a walking mountain of destruction but if its engine isnt strong enough it will be running as slow as a snail giving the enemy plenty of time to tear it to pieces with laser,plasma,canon, machine gun fire among many other lethal forms of weaponery and defenses. Another cool thing about the design process is you can paint your units to whatever paint scheme you want.\n\nSound effects are brutal with the screams of infantry dying in agony as giant flamethrower type canons burn them into charred flesh or machine gun fire creates a field of dead bodies lying in pools of blood. All the while the battle cries of those still living permeate the carnage filled air with combat rage. Giant mechs stomp the ground below them with thundering earth shattering effect. Titanic tanks the size of Keith Laumer's BOLO units crush all with their mighty treads as they blast away at long range with their world destroying arsenal of weapons.\n\nGraphics are very well done with a rpg board game feel to them similar to Steve Jacksons CAR WARS with an impressive level of zooming in where units do not lose their level of visual detail.  Seeing trenches filled with the dead bodies of infantry in pools of blood definitely gives off a visceral thrill of massive carnage reminding me of the war scenes in the future in THE TERMINATOR. Tanks and Mechs burn in smoke trailed flames and show battle damage as they annihilate all in their path to reach their goal.\n\nGame play comes in two forms where you defend or attack. I have never played a tower defense game before but that is what this is supposedly called though to me it reminded me more of mech combat in CYBER EMPIRES by Silicon Knights back in the 1990s where you destroy or defend against waves of enemies. Here the goal is to defend against waves of enemies or acttack while fighting your way across the map to exit thus reaching a certain victory score once enough surviving units have exited the map. This may sound easy but one of the coolest and incredible things about GRATUITOUS TANK BATTLES is its adaptable ai where the game adjusts its combat to your play style constantly changing to your new tactics. All the while the ai never feels like its cheating. During battles you may also end up getting supply drops allowing you to get things like free supply trucks into the field which will add huge amounts of victory points if they make it across the battlefield.\n\nGRATUITIOUS TANK BATTLES if your into designing units and then sending them off to battle to see how they will destroy or be destroyed then this is the game for you.","April 17, 2015","true","4.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The learning curve is a bit steep at first though.  You need to stick with it until you get some of the upgraded equipment.  Also, designing new units is a large part of the game - sort of like the old Mechwarrior series.  But I've been having a lot of fun with it lately, and given how cheap it is, I'd say it's well worth the money.","July 26, 2012","true","28.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The one twist that GTB has that I haven't seen in any other games is that you get to play as the attacker.  Very quickly, you are essentially forced to use custom designs since the computer AI is quite unforgiving but that's a good thing since it requires adaptation and actual thinking.

It's still good, but has a LOT of things that drags it down.\n\nThis game puts you in the early 22nd century, after World War 1 has been going on for a LOT longer than it should have. You get to 'control' entire armies and defensive positions as you duke it out in a tower-defense like game. I still don't really get why its a TD game, but what the hell, its a game.\n\nPros:\n- You can actually customize how your units look with paints and other parts.\n- Damage system is just like Space Battles, making it familiar with GSB players.\n- You can play as either the defender or the attacker.\n\nCons:\n- Seemed a little mediocre, as GSB actually had tactics and, well, was more fun.\n- The only tactic is literally just spam units until you win for the offense.\n- The defences are really weak, still taking at least 10 hits to destroy a light tank, or even a light mech.\n\nOverall, it is a decent game. It wasn't what I would have liked to be, like tanks, mechs and infantry on an OPEN BATTLEFIELD! Firing almost non-stop at eachother with lasers, machine guns and big-♥♥♥ guns. I guess that I had too high hopes.\n\nI rate this game a 5/10 (Average game). For all of the GSB fans, this is not the game you would want. It is really restrictive to how you play, as there are no real tactics and, well, it just isn't fun in the long run.","January 28, 2015","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Okay, that's not EXACTLY true, but they are pretty similar. GTB takes on a more tower defensey feel, though, and I can't say that I cared for it as much as GSB. Surely that doesn't mean GTB is a bad game by any stretch of the word, but it isn't as fun (imho) as it's sci-fi predecessor. I'd pick it up if it were on sale, but only if you like tower defense with TONS of customization (and the opportunity to play as the attacker, too).\n\nI'd also recommend the expansion, "The Western Front". If you enjoy the base game, the expansion adds a lot of plability and new unit types. Worth taking a look, perhaps?","May 26","true","36.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
