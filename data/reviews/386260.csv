I would draw bases, heavy units, and split teams between Red and Blue (Per my pen colors). After that, I would draw dots as the troops and feint lines marking their "shots" while X-ing out deceased troops.\n\nI found a game like this on Kongregate and that was good fun, and now I'm happy to drop five dollars in what is basically a graphical representation of my imagination, circa ~2005.\nThis game is basically what was going on in my head, only depicted as "Cells" rather than armies.\n\nA great in-between game, not something you spend an entire sitdown session doing. It's great during loading screens, queue times on your chosen MMO, or simply find yourself with not much to do the hour before leaving for work. I wouldn't fault anyone for getting it on sale but if you're like me and use the 1 dollar per Hour metric of gaming quality, then this will likely do the job.\n\nThe only fault is a very brief learning curve when you figure out that the best strategy is charging up your beginning cell, avoiding conflict. If you can make it to a level 3 cell before your enemies do, then you're pretty much set as you'll have all the pixels you'll need to both defend yourself, and begin absorbing neutral cells. I've cleared several levels by doing this with only a couple of times I would refer to as "Close calls".","October 5, 2015","true","55.5"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","34","42","3","2"

Weather it's worth 5 bucks is up to you.\n\nThis game is a lot like Eufloria in that you have spheres (cells) that generate small balls (Antibodies) that you use to attack other spheres or upgrade your own spheres.  3 sphere "levels" (small medium large), each provides more health and faster Antibody spawn rate.  The game is pretty much decided on how quickly you can spawn your antibodies, then zerg rush enemy spheres.  At least it would be, but the AI seems to like to ignore the player, so 9 times out of 10 you can move your sphere to the side and let the 2 or 3 or 4 enemy spheres duke it out while you upgrade your own sphere and ninja others while they're busy fighting.  There's a way to upgrade how fast and strong your spheres are, but it doesn't seem to matter much.\n\nOnly thing I didn't like is there's no button to select all your antibodies so you end up in and endless cycle of click-drag-select then another click telling them where to go.\n\nThere's about 60 levels to go through.

AI is annoying at best and often will do extremely stupid things, making a very easy game.  As an example, one of the early-mid levels in original has several neutral organisms orbiting around the center with you and the enemies in the middle.  Ended the level after a minute or so and zoomed out to see 2-3 groups of antibodies from each color just chasing a rogue neutral cell.  Occasionally the ai will launch coordinated attacks, but by that time you should have snowballed enough to just roll over their cells ignoring your own losses and win the level.\n\nTactical advantage in moving cells consists of saving minute amounts of time by moving close to neutral cells you plan to take, and past that the only time you'll move a cell is to stop it moving after the AI bumps into it.  As someone who played all of the Phage games, which are free by the way, this one is a disappointment with its faceroll difficulty and dearth of tatical choices.  As an added bonus, there is no strategic value in letting antibodies sit idle at all.  Ever.\nThe fastest way to clear levels is by selecting all antibodies and doing one task at a time, overwhelming enemy and neutral cells, while the constant stream of antibodies flowing in the spaces between your cells neutralizes almost all efforts to attack you.  Biowall makes it even easier by limiting the area you have to mouse over to select all of your antibodies.  This all being said, its atmosphere and music fit the overall theme of low difficulty and make for a relaxing experience.  Except when the AI bump into you.","September 27, 2015","true","6.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It's interesting at first, but it quickly becomes repetetive.   The entire premise of the game:  Grow/acquire cells.  That's it.  No depth.  No massive strategy.  It's grow-and-conquer.  If you're not fast enough at circling your antibodies and getting them to beef up your cell, you won't be able to get anywhere.  Eventually, it's about overwhelming your computer opponents with the number of cells/antibodies.\n\nSome levels have a bug that allegedly was fixed in a prior patch but still persists -- your cell(s) can get stuck in the cell walls.  Ditto for opponent's cells.  Sometimes your cells will overlay with another cell, and you can't click either.  If your cell gets stuck in a wall/overlayed, you can't move, you can't send out antibodies, you have to restart the level.   This makes for an infuriating gameplay, especially at higher levels.  I've lost several games in one high level because my cell keeps getting stuck in cell walls.\n\nResponsivity of the cells: You will click and point for your cel to move.  Nope!  The cell likes to make up its own mind if it may or may not move.  Same for the antibodies.  They'll move when you don't want them to, or they'll not move when you've given them an order.  This bug appears about ten percent of the time in any level.\n\nFinally, the game  only has so many levels.  There's no random 'map' or unlimited play.  Once you win the game, that's it.  You're done.  You can restart, but, what's the point now that you know how to win every map?\n\nI'd like to recommend the game, but the bugs and repetition aren't worth it.","September 16, 2015","false","43.4"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","19","32","0","0"

Immerses the player in a cellular world where you struggle for dominance of the cellular pool.\n\nI loved playing it and loved the feeling of crushing my enemies when I have a large number of cells to control.\n\nThere are 3 bugs that annoy me somewhat:\n1. When you have a large number of cells, it sometimes happens that one of the cells just decides to wander off and no matter what you do, you cannot control it. It simply wanders off into enemy territory getting itself killed.\n2. This also occurs when the game has progressed a bit. When there are loads of anti-bodies on the map, the commands have a massive lag when interacting with them. They sometimes respond in 6 - 8 seconds after you have already given a command. This makes micro a horror.\n3. The antibodies sometimes go smoothly around corners in the map and other times they get stuck in the terrain rendering them pretty much useless.\n\nI am mentioning these bugs to drive at a point. The game is small and is not a technical masterpiece. What I mean by that is that you don't need to be a master RTS gamer to play this game. There are simple mechanics and the game is made to have fun, not to be extremely competitive.\n\nThat being said, I really enjoy playing this game.

There are upgrades for example to upgrade the speed of the organism but it doesn't say exactly what it does, the speed of movement or the speed of how anti-bodies are produced? Also there are times that though your organism has evolved to simultaneously with the enemy organism the enemy can produce more anti-bodies for some reason. I tried to get an explanation for this in the forum but they chose to delete my question instead of answering it because I suggested it was cheating. I have been playing level 6 over and over and upgrading, I did this for hours yet there was seemingly no advantage increase over the enemy organism. One would think after so many upgrades I should be able to walk all over the enemy organism afterwards.

The macro scale has been changed to micro, and we have cells+hormone molecules setting instead of cosmic theme. Victories give you upgrades for movement and defence. The scenery represents primordial soup vessels of various forms with neutral fungi on walls, it looks and feels quite atmospheric and convincing. It's also got stunning minimalistic visuals at close view, some sort of scalable vector graphics with really pretty lighting effects. In this regard I can compare it to Tulpa and Raeticon.\n\nThe downside here is the clunky Unity engine with UI shortfalls.. some will argue that Unity's totally allright per se, they say even Wasteland 2 is made on Unity, so it's just the devs can't use it properly. Maybe so, frankly speaking I hate W2 anyway.. and I don't know sh!t about engines' programming. But I definitely know when my clicks won't register occasionately and the active zones won't work near the screen edges. The interactions starts to feel uncertain and you can easily imagine what it turns out to be in harder lavels - a ragequit fest!\n\nAnyway I really liked everything about this game except its technical basis, 100% advise you to get it for mobile, but I have to downvote it as a PC game for not passing my extremely high quality standarts!\n\n<russian>\nКлюч получен от разработчика бесплатно!\nВ основе своей это клон Галкона (примитивная стратегия в реальном времени с 1 видом строения и 1 видом боевой единицы) лишь с той новацией, что сферы медленно перемещаются по полю и можно прокачать их уровень (дважды) при помощи "автоатаки". Макро масштаб сменили на микро, и теперь у нас клетки+молекулы гормонов вместо космоса. За победы дают улучшения скорости и защиты. Окружение представляет собой разной формы емкости с первичным бульоном и нейтральными грибками по стенам, все выглядит и ощущается очень атмосферно и убедительно. Также у игры потрясающий минималистический внешний вид при приближении, что-то типа масштабируемой векторной графики с приятными световыми эффектами. В этом отношении можно сравнить с Тулпой и Рэатиконом.\n\nНедостатком здесь является неуклюжий движок Единство с проблемами интерфейса... кто-то доказывает, что эта технология вполне пригодна сама по себе, говорят, даже Пустыня 2 сделана на Единстве, так что это все разработчики, которые не умеют правильно его использовать. Может быть и так, но, честно говоря, я терпеть не могу П2... и ни в зуб ногой в программировании движков. Но я хорошо понимаю, когда щелчки случайно не регистрируются, а активные зоны не срабатывают при приближении к краю экрана. Взаимодействия становятся неуверенными, и легко себе представить, во что это выливается на более сложных уровнях - праздник яростных выходов из игры!\n\nВ любом случае, мне игра понравилась всем, кроме технической основы, 100% советую скачать для мобилы, но придется поставить минус как игре для ПК в связи с моими высокими стандартами качества!","January 31","false","4.6"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","9","20","2","5"

Antibodies unit max is capped and it becomes a chore as the enemies  run away they produce antibodies to defend and your offensive antibodies can be wiped before they reach enemy. its like having 12 factories to produce tanks but you are capped to 6 . the only soluton is to wait for your slow main body organisms to get closer to enemy. its a half decent game but not even worth 3 bucks. at least the game has promise if they can adjust the mechanics but as it is this is one hell of  a boring slow paced game.\n\nTo make matters worse some maps in the dlc campaign actually freeze you in place every 3 seconds or so, making this frustrating experience even more so. the dlc gets a 2/10 for having worthless upgrades main game 4/10 .\n\nsimilar and better free games. tentacle wars, tentacle wars the purple menace, solarmax 1 and 2,neo circuit, the space game,galaxy harvest, and a couple others I cant remember might dig em up if I got time.","April 17","false","13.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

One thing for sure, it is very original.  It could be so relaxing, it could be so soothing, it could be so awesome.  Let's just say it is so close to those three things.  What is holding me back from a thumbs up is the controls.  What they are is frustrating as heck.  The best way to describe the game is as an organic RTS, so for the movement of your objects I expect that to be sloppy and flowing.  The controls are so simple, yet so botched in implementation.  You control two differnent things, an organism(s) and the anti-bodies that it produces.  You left click on your organism to select it and right click in the direction that you want it to go and it will most of the time meander in that direction, bouncing off stuff it hits.  That is the organic sloppy part and it moves like it should.  The anti-bodies you control by left or right clicking and whle holding in the mouse button create a bounding box around the anti-bodies you want to move.  Once you do that the selected anti-bodies turn a brighter white and then you left click on the target you want them to attack or on a point you want them to move to.  Your mouse wheel zooms in and out pretty much centered on where your cursor is and moving the cursor to the edge of the screen pans the map in that direction.  Pretty standard stuff.  Where the controls fail is in the implementation.  For the next part of my description please note that I play in full screen mode with a dual monitor setup.  If you move the cursor to the very edge of the screen the panning stops, you have to have the cursor about 1/2" from the edge of the screen for the panning to work.  If you go to the edge of the screen and the panning stops, your next action can't be to start a bounding box, it just fails to start the first corner when you push either mouse button.  You have to release the button and start again, usually when you do this you move back to or pass through the 1/2" from the edge of the screen and then the map starts panning you away from where you wanted to start your bounding box.  As far as the edge of the screen that abutts the other monitor, there is no stopping the cursor at the edge, if you move the cursor outside the screen and onto the second monitor and as soon as you click the game minimizes.  There is also the frustrating act of trying to select your organism, sometimes you have to click it several times to select it and make it active.  I think what happens is that at times when you single left click you actually select a single anti-body that is over top of the organism. (and there are hundreds of anti-bodies at times).\n\nBottom line is that this game is good as it is now, and if they fix the controls so that you don't have to constantly fight the interface, it would be fantastic.  The sound track is almost hypnotic, the visuals are awesome fractals that grow and pulsate as your organism(s) grow.  With the controls, when things are busy on the screen it is just a frustrating mess.  On a scale of 1 to 10, the game as of now is a 4.9.  Fix the controls and it is 9.5+.","December 22, 2015","false","5.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It's still playable (though frustrating), as you have to repeatably perform the same action until the unit responds. You can only control one cell at a time (also tedious). Once reaching the middle levels however, it becomes more a matter of luck, since things happen too quickly for the shoddy controls to allow you to keep up. Once you have made your 4th attempt at trying to make the cell stop or change direction, it's far too late, and the game is reduced to a spectator sport.","December 23, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It's more akin to a $2.00 app purchase. *Edit* Nevermind, it's free with in game purchases on Google Play so it's just a copy of a phone app and it's exactly the caliber of game you'd expect for a copy of an app meant to be played on phones with zero improvements. Oh, except it costs 10 bucks currently instead of being free.\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alexanderbyzov.microcosmum\n\nThe evolution options are extremely abstract and almost not noticeable. I was hoping for some detail or hard choices for upgrades but there really aren't any. Every single upgrade you get you equip to almost no effect. Then it's bogged down with a silly upgrade by combining 5 of an upgrade of the same type. It simply makes a level +1 of the upgrade. There's never a point where you don't want to combine. The number of slots means there's almost no choices about what to equip. They could easily eliminate the complete waste of time of converting by just having a numeric stat that goes up when you complete a level. The AI is terrible. You'll start a map with a 3 opponents and they'll all simultaneously start attacking your single unupgraded cell. In order to complete levels that start with me at a disadvantage, I have to restart over and over until the opponent cells attack each other instead of simultaneously spamming me with antibodies. Cell control is terrible. When you try to move a cluster of cells they bump into each other and often end up moving nowhere, bouncing and going in the opposite direction, or very slowly moving to where I want them as I repeat movement commands and watch them bounce into each other over and over. Cells that I take over seemingly randomly choose not to respond to movement commands, which often results in them sitting there and getting pounded to nothingness. This isn't common, but it's annoying and seems to repeat if I take the cell back over. I'm left to ignore those cells for the level.","April 18","false","33.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

You are front-loaded with everything you need to know to play the game without the chance to practice what you've just learned, so when you start the game immediately after you've already forgotten most of what you've read. It's much better practice to do the tutorial in the first few levels, introducing the player to all of the mechanics step by step.

Several levels were almost explicit copies at that. Granted I don't blame them for copying Auralux given I found Auralux to be amazing myself.\n\nIf you don't know Auralux, in a nutshell, it's a strategic numbers game: outproduce your opponents, defend your cells, destroy/capture other cells at vulnerable times, repeat.\n\nI'd recommend the game, despite everything listed below if it were free or at least a maximum of $2. I may be stingy but this game is not worth the listed $9 in my opinion given I'm fairly certain that anyone that's done enough Unity tutorials could clone this game in a fairly short period of time, excluding the graphics.\n\nOn a positive note though, when you post a bug in the forum, a fix is usually made available the day of.\n\nFull Review -\nThe controls don't really seem very "mature", last I checked the circular selection does work but there is no indication for it (can't see it like you can with the square). Sometimes the cells simply stop responding and just start doing their own thing, wandering off. Sometimes the cells ram each other so much that it's like Unity's 2d physics engine gives up and lets them overlap. Once this happens you cannot regain control until they separate OR you tell all your cells to move to a certain location. You also cannot tell your cells or "antibodies" to regroup in the same location they are currently in (they have a wandering/flocking ai meaning they meander around if given the opportunity)\n\nThe graphics are really nice to look at but when you're working to beat the level, you're generally not paying attention to them so for me with a game like this, while they are nice, they are also kind of rendered pointless since you don't have time to appreciate them. I'd rather have the time spent on graphics spent elsewhere.\n\nSadly the game becomes highly repetitive after a while given that after you beat the levels, the only thing you have left to do is max out your cell's abilities via the evolve menu. With differing levels of upgrades (purple being the best so far) it seems alright until you realize that the only level (at least that I've been able to get) are white (the lowest) from levels you've already beaten.\n\nThe AI difficulty is increased by giving the other cells more of a default advantage over you (i.e. they produce antibodies generally a lot faster than you and have better armor) along with having them generally target you over any other cell even when there are 4 other types all around them and you're not strategically optimal. Presumably these disadvantages can be countered with personal upgrades via the evolve menu but with only getting white's it turns it into a massive grindfest.\n\nThere also seem to be levels beyond the last level listed but you can't access them without continuing to play without stopping after the end. I'm not sure if this functionality was intentional or if those levels are only being tested still or if these are the levels that are suppose to be "exclusive" to any DLC they have or might have in the future.","February 3","false","8.7"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Pretty boring I'd say.","April 3","false","5.4"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

That's a nice idea, but the implementation is odd; it involves lots of clicking (and re-clicking) and dragging, and cells actually bump against each other and then gently drift away.\nSecond: it's a lot less complicated. There's simply not much to do. After getting the basics, you expect some extra game elements, which don't exist. Perhaps the AI could become more challenging, which it doesn't. The same strategy actually works for all levels!\nThird: there's a 'upgrade your cells' - feature included, which seems a failure; it automatically means you're the fastest and strongest cell out there, which lowers the difficulty even further!\n\nIt does look somewhat nice, but there's not much graphical content. I can't say the music is good, because it gets really repetitive, which is quite an accomplishment for a game that's about two hours long.","October 31, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

If there are several opponents then it essentially becomes a pointless efffort from the very start. Typically one opponent will start in a very strategic spot and/or have some other ridiculous buff. It just becomes a game of cat and mouse with it having absolutely no fun. And the difficulty settings, oh , the difficulty settings. Hard, Normal, Simple, and Easy. The way the game attempts to make the difficulty harder is by making the enemy have more and more insane buffs, in an attempt to hide the painfully stupid AI. I found that even with having upgrades from future levels it was insanely hard to conquer past levels on Hard. And other levels I found that even with the difficulty set to Simple it was way harder than it should have been for that low of a difficulty. All in all, should not get, even if on sale.","March 7","false","0.7"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

A somewhat interesting environment to play in. Looked like hours of exploring, strategizing and evolving.\n...\nUntill I got killed by A.I. nine times out of ten due to the really, really bad control over my own cells. The response to my clicks was terrible (you have to click real sloooow to actually activate one cell and then click slooooow again to the point you want it to go). But pathfinding is a meer joke and you more often than you'd suggest find yourself asking "What the hell is cell XY doing there and why is it going in the opposite direction I send it to!?".\nNot to mention the efficiency the  A.I. reacts to your sloppy movements ... frustrating to say the least!\n\nUPDATE v 2.4:\nAs many of the above is still valid, update v2.4 solved some of the issues and the game is viable in it's current state.\nBut if you aren't an indie game enthusiast, I still don't recommend it.\nMaybe next updates and DLCs will further evolve the game and it's feel.\n\nBTW: My kids and me really enjoy the music and ambient sounds as the really appealing setting a lot.\nIf it weren't for the issues, i would likely reccomend it.\n\nratings :\nfor casual players - 35%\nfor normal players - 55%\nfor geeks/indiefans - 62%","April 13","false","17.7"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

Upgrade self until maxed level (3) then take over another. Upgrade to level 3 and move on. Then eventually you win. Multiplayer would make this a lot more interesting.
