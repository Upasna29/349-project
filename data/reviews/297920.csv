"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/297920/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","TL:DR? See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Space Colony is the Steam release version a 2003 game with the same title. The game was developed and self-published by FireFly Studios whose most notable work includes the popular Stronghold franchise. The game draws heavy inspiration from the well-known 'The Sims' games, the 'Tycoon' series of games, and FireFly's own Stronghold titles which is reflected by the existence of a combat mechanic.\n\nThe game features a lengthy single-player campaign where the player takes on the role of Venus Jones and her diverse team of space colonists working for Blackwater Industries, a company hell-bent to increase profit and productivity at the expense of its own employees.  Travel to different worlds and follow one of the two branching storylines by either going through the military or civilian campaigns. Like a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game, it also features a 'skirmish' mode along side the campaign. Likewise, the game also has a sandbox mode like a regular Sim/Management game.\n\nPROS:+ Classical HD remake of the isometric view of old games with some enhancement on detail\n+ Colorful and goofy characters with different personalities and traits\n+ Story mode is fun and offers a variety of challenges (limited resources, colonists, etc.)\n+ Interesting new idea to mix different game elements such as: simulation (relationships, needs etc.), real time strategy (combat, base defenses and resource gathering), and management (resource management, work efficiency and trade)...but (See CON #1 and #2)\n+ Fully voice acted with decent voice acting and dialogue\n+ Branching story mode to showcase the civilian and military aspects of the game\n+ Upbeat techno soundtracks that fits the game very well\n+ Map Editor to make your own scenario or maps\n+ Steam Workshop support\n+ Contains all other bonus packages for the game\n\nCONS:- The RTS elements are basic: It lacks essential features that should be mandatory for proper implementation of an RTS aspect of a game such as but not limited to: Unit groups (ctrl+1 etc.), Attack move, patrol, or just a hotkey to Stop units would be nice.\n- The 'Sim' aspect of the game is also lacking in its complexity when it comes to colonist relationships.\n- The isometric graphics does not allow you to rotate the screen or objects.\n- Lacking in option menu: Hotkeys cannot be rebound\n- Speed setting is lacking with only pause, normal, or fast as the only options.\n- Base construction follows the 'Sim style of creation' where items are available at anytime (unless you are in story mode). This is under CONS because they could have gone with the RTS style of base construction which would follow a technology tree system which unlocks specific options based on existing technology or structures. This, in my opinion, would have added to the game's complexity.\n\nCONCLUSION:NICE GAME with a lot of POTENTIAL.  The concept of mixing together the various aspects of Simulation, Real Time Strategy, and Management games is a great idea but only if the proper mechanics from each of those genres are implemented properly. Among other things for example, Space Colony severely lacks basic RTS controls such as unit grouping and waypoints which lead to some frustrating and clunky unit control. Another issue is with the Simulation aspect where the shallow relationship mechanics made for some boring relationship micromanagement and the lack of screen-rotation led to some mis-clicking accidents.  If these issues are ironed out, the experience would have been much better.\n\nOverall I still enjoyed my experience with Space Colony and I can RECOMMEND this game to anyone who's interested in this type of 'Frankenstein' genre. With its after-years graphics, this game is not system requirement heavy (unless your PC is powered by a potato) and can easily run even on netbook computers making this a nice game when you're on the move.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike our Reviews?

Thankfully they didn't 'improve' on it too much and kept all the story line and quirky humor the same.  They have however improved on the graphics enough to bring it up to date and now that it's on steam it will be more fun to make custom maps and scenarios to share with other people on here...we just have to wait for someone to start doing that and I'll be getting on with mines shortly too :P\n\nAll in all, a great game to play for both new and returning players of Space Colony.

The operatives themselves being slaves to their bank, and the corporation running the galaxy, Blackwater Industries.  Blackwater industries will not often provide you with much to complete this task, and chaos often ensues.\n\nThere are social aspects, as well as plenty of RTS combat.  Luckily there is a pause button, you'll need it.","May 31, 2015","true","42.9"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","45","50","0","4"

The crew has needs to be tended to but that goes for the most part on auto pilot.\n\nIn this game you build up a corporate colony. Build resourcers, beds, chairs and laserturrets.\nYou can put a shower room right in the middle of the colony hub and not one single crew member will care. Sauna next to the prisson? Not a problem. Counseling bot next to the dance floor? That can be arranged.\n\nIn the campain mode, you start off with a small colony which you have to expand. At first it looks like you can't scroll across the screen, but thats only because the area around the base hasn't been explored with lights yet.\n\nAfter the first 5 or 6 mission you split off into two paths: a peaceful path and a war path.\nThe missions can be pretty severe and even the peace route can be pretty violent. The first time i tried the peace route, my base got overrun with aliens and my entire crew got killed. I was then congratulated by the corporation for killing off my crew without having a mutiny, they were impressed. Haven't tried the war path yet and i think my crew won't survive that one either.\n\nPro\n- good ol' fashioned building construction.\n- Shooting furry aliens\n- Somewhat dark sense of humor\n- Sims-light in space.\n- During the campaign, your entire base will be carried over as long as you play missions on the same planet.\n\nCon\n- Due to being an older game it has no zoom function. Can get irritating at times.\n- Iff an important crew member dies, it's basicly game over for the campaign.\n- Tammy\n\nRating. 7/10 Would shoot hordes of small furry aliens again.","May 2, 2015","true","5.2"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","34","37","11","0"

The latest, before buying this, was the GoG.com HD version. In firefly's advertising they make claims about this steam version. A new single Player campaign? New missions and lots more. But this seems to be exactly the same as the HD version. Another former fan found it to be the same. He posted about it if you care to read it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/297920/discussions/0/620712364039558527/\n\nI didn't bother going to all that trouble. Verifying map files to see what was added. After buying the game I started playing and could not find any new campaign. Or anything else except for the launcher which is supposed to allow adding workshop items.\n\nApparently I'm a sucker. I feel cheated. Good job firefly.\n\nThe game itself is fun.

Steam Edition is now let loose in 2015 that adds all of the modern conveniences, including a brand new single-player campaign, achievements and both workshop and cloud support. Core of the game is focused on real-time strategy but it brings so much more. Great blend of  Sims, Time Management, City-Building, Strategy and Tower Defense gameplay along with a distinct 90s space vibe.\n\nInitially getting given options of playing through the campaign (including cut-scenes and stats that carryover between missions), galaxy mode (choose your own planets and pathway), sandbox mode (choose your own planets and given access to more equipment without upgrading) or loading user-created mods. Included are a bunch of community favorites but there is a huge selection to choose from. With the addition of a reasonably intuitive level editor and steam workshop support it would be very easy to spend many hours just playing custom games.\n\nThankfully even though upgraded, Space Colony has kept all of it's original charm. The tacky yet amusing banter between odd-couple characters, the combination of 70s disco and elevator music and the space creatures straight out of your favorite B horror movies. For fans of the genres I mentioned above this is a game not to be missed, more so if you never had a chance to play the originals because (imo) you are in for an absolute treat. Just make sure you have the spare time as it can be quite addictive.\n\nFew small downsides, Inability to zoom your view (older engine) but the wonderfully detailed pixel art makes up for this and sometimes the UI can be a little clunky though more a matter of playing the game longer. Highly recommended game and one worth shortlisting. Cheers folks. :)\n\n(intro/tutorial)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvpONpc_Skc\n\n(first missions)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SXilHPJ5Os","May 8, 2015","true","4.4"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","36","42","0","0"

At the heart of it though is still the same game with the same flaws. You still can't rotate objects, you can't zoom in/out on the map, there's only two speeds (normal and turbo), and there's lots of actions to be done but none of it can be queued. The selection of buildings and decorations is rather basic and graphics are by today's standards, quite dated.\n\nHowever, when you get right down to gameplay and working with this group of highly dysfunctional misfits, Space Colony really comes to life. Keeping them sane and happy is no small task, plus romance can spring up amongst colonists in the most unlikely of places.\n\nIt might be an older game, but I still recommend it.","May 1, 2015","true","22.3"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","0"

In the case of Space Colony it was already polished, if you remember back to its first inception and the HD version of 2012 then you will be looking forward to this remastered edition to the game. To those wondering what this game is about, you are simple colonists trying to survive against hunger, aliens and sanity. Relationships are important, when you are in a small base with nowhere to go you need to get along with those with you otherwise chaos will ensure. To be productive and to survive you need everyone on board. While all my hours playing this game may have not fully registered on here this is a game I look forward to playing and can't wait to see what workshop creations will come and how the community here really embraces this great Sim like space survival.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434614811\n","April 30, 2015","true","4.6"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","25","33","4","0"

Once one of the best games for the Macintosh, Space Colony is constantly referred to as "The Sims" in space. You play as god, moving around a dozenish people to improve their relationships with one another, limited in pace by an economy of space mining and farming.  The best part is the voice acting, as the quirks of each character bring out light comedy to keep you entertained for hours. These quirks will have you build different entertainment venues for each character, to maximize the benefits of each worker's work.  Or maybe you won't, because some characters are pretty useless.  This combination of micromanagement and macromanagement is far from tedious.\n\nThe Steam adaptation of it has some flaws.  Modern day computers have bigger and HD screens so, the field of view is widened and the buttons are smaller.  This doesn't interfere with gameplay.  There's some problems with audio balance for some sound effects. Alt+tab (switching windows) crashes Space Colony.  I still think this is forgivable, and I'd be willing to give the game 5/5 stars.\n\nWell-done, 5 stars.","April 13","true","42.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

The original may be from 2003, but it plays like games from the 90's with similar charm and quirkiness: Theme Hospital immediately comes to mind, for example.\n\nIn a similar vein to Theme Hospital, a lot of the basics become a bit monotonous (once you've built one corridor, you've built them all), but there are enough new building types and scenario objectives to keep it interesting. There's a whole host of things to do too, ranging from harvesting crops to mining, keeping bugs at bay and cleaning up a dirty station, treating injured colonists, having them sit down at a restaurant...you get the idea, it's a long list.\n\nWhat really makes the game, for me, are the characters.\n\nThey each have quirky phrases and character interactions, and can go from totally satisfied in a relationship to stir-crazy and requiring detention to calm them down pretty rapidly without the correct needs satisfied - the most obvious one being human interaction. They die if not looked after, have audible banter when they bump into each other, moan when things aren't going well...it's fun to work out how to achieve the objectives of a new mission, but far more so to try out the new characters as they appear in your base.","May 4, 2015","true","20.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

It has been described as The Sims in Space. I have never liked The Sims games as I find that they are far too repetitive and boring. Space Colony is a good building game, The Sims element is that you do have to be aware of the needs of your operatives to improve production. This does give an extra twist to the game that you have to think about and some of the challenges are based around ensuring that your crew are reletively happy or they won't work.\n\nAny Building Sim worth it's salt should have an element of ensuring that you are providing basic things, such as food, so I don't find this particularly strange, as some have mentioned. Making sure your crew does not go mad while on an abandoned planet does give the game an additional challenge.\n\nThe object of most of the challenges is to produce as much money or supplies as possible. Each crew member has his/her own specialism so the object of the game is to mangage your crew to get the highest productivity while protecting the base from space monsters.\n\nThere does appear to be a few bugs, that I noticed. I have found that if you save your progress regularly, then when you encounter a bug re-load your progress and the bug goes away. The bugs do appear to be based around not recognising your progress. I also had an extractor that wasn't being recognised by the supply depot. These are all really small bugs which don't hinder game enjoyment but may mean loss in some progress if you don't save.\n\nI would put it in the same category as games like Dungeon Keeper or War for the overworld.\nHave fun building and watch out for the protoraptors, they are tougher then they look!","April 21","true","68.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

If you've got the original Space Colony or are buying for the first time, you will want the Steam edition. The Steam edition is also the most likely to get further updates as it is considered to be the definitive version by the devs.","August 11, 2015","true","9.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I know the HD non Steam version is out there for half the price but personally i feel the Steam Workshop support helps justify the price increase somewhat.\n\nIf you're new the Space Colony, basically it's worth £11.99.

It's like the Sims and theme park. The problem is, its too much like the sims. You have to baby your crew, they forget to eat, sleep, clean, and all the basic human needs, so you have to monitor them heavily. Plus they have relationship requirements. I dont mind taking care of some issues, but it gets overwhelming quick, and they can be stubborn as a mule.\n\nI only have a limited time with the game, I mainly played the sandbox mode. I never had to face the aliens, but if I did, I feel like I would of been in deep, due to the fact I have to juggle the tiniest problems delicately.\n\nI wouldnt recommend this game unless your into macromanagement.

Having played games like StarTopia, The Spatials, and games in the similar vein, I was unimpressed by the way this game handles station personnel and security.\n\nIn one mission you run into these space rats and can't get rid of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s because you can't shoot at them. I went into freeplay and could not find a way to get rid of them there either. There's no hint or anything on how to get rid of them, but they muck up your base and keep you from putting down new buildings or items. They also make the worst noise ever.\n\nThen there's the plantlife which will swoop in and destroy your buildings, wasps that attack your stuff, and through all this you have these Sims-like idiots complaining you haven't given them the right assortment of furniture to keep them happy, so they stop doing their jobs, and your colony falls to pieces.\n\nThe placement of items is sometimes not as clear as it should be, you are led through the most linear storyline I've seen in these games in a while (the only choice being whether you want to focus on a tactical or economics campaign fork), and even when you try to think tactically and plan things out, while you're trying to place items their visual representation does not align with how you think they align and you end up placing them several blocks away from where you wanted them to be.\n\nOverall it quickly gets more annoying than fun, and here I thought games were supposed to be fun...","September 29, 2015","false","8.8"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","16","32","0","0"

It's pretty realistic as to what probably would happen if this was real life, with people's needs, salaries, etc.\n\nCons: The game is pretty unstable. Every time you tab out of it for anything, it crashes and sometimes freezes your entire steam up. I tested this out on my laptop AND my desktop PC, both of which have this issues.  There is also no window mode, despite there being different options for the size of the game, it's all in "full screen" mode no matter what you do, and there aren't any files you can alter in the folder to make it windowed either.\n\n\nDespite how good the game COULD be, with the pure fact that you can't even tab out of it without crashing, makes it almost not enjoyable. Maybe if they ever decide to at least stabilize the game, I'll change it to recommended, other than that... don't bother.","May 7","false","1.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","4"

Plus, it'll crash sometimes if you alt-tab in and out of the game.\n\nIt's fun and challenging, but the lack of quality-of-life features just drag it down. The base-building aspect feels nice and complex, but it's incredibly annoying to have to deal with the relationship mechanic between colonists. This isn't optional either: unhappy colonists work for less time, move slower and even destroy your own base assets in a worst-case scenario.

Ultimately what kills the appeal is the failure to develop a cohesive storyline. I played the first "set" of the story campaign, and it ended briefly without any real conclusion - heck, the drive for the characters was about as vague as it gets. I could not understand why I suddenly had to choose between a military or civilian path; nothing in the first campaign even hinted at this dichotomy nor helped me understand what each path meant. There is no real backstory on the characters, but I kept hoping for something more. I wanted to keep them alive, but only because I had spent time building them into a team... then I find that none of them stick around except for the main character who was just about as cookie-cutter as the rest of them. I don't care about multiplayer, and getting interrupted only gave me pause to ask whether I even cared to keep playing... and sadly this game fails to keep me interested enough for more.","December 30, 2015","false","6.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Plenty of different resource types that each require different buildings that in turn require different skills to run. Lasty moving on from skills are the colonists themselves, each have different personalities and skills. the skills can be trained into your colonists and you will need to build different recreational, food and health facilities to keep your colonists happy.","May 6, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly I lent my edition to someone and never got it back, so I now bought the steam version for old times sake.\n\nThe game hold up suprisingly well. The graphics overhaul makes it still good enough to look at. The characters are just as fun and quirky as I remember, the missions and maps are complex and diverse. The mix of Sims and strategy game is still rather unique and still as fun as I remembered.\n\nThe editor is quite robust as well and easy to use on top so you can handcraft missions for yourself or others.\n\nMy only gripe with the game is that the last few missions of the civilian campaign are military in content. If I want to play military I will play that branch. Meh.\n\nBut apart from that - great game, well worth getting!","September 13, 2015","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was obviously a labour of love for the developers and that shines through.\nPros: Very addictive and enjoyable.  I played this a lot when I was young and dont regret picking it up on steam.  Fell in love with it all over again.\n\nCons: There are occasional bugs that do upset the experience, also you cant change the camera angle - but after a while you completely forget about that.\n\nRecommendation: If it gets too easy, then try playing on a harder level in galaxy mode, even after many hours of gameplay there are some maps that I am not able to figure out a defence against.\n\nWould love to see a Space Colony 2, but I can't imagine how they could improve this one in terms of actual gameplay. Very well balanced and a classic of good game design.","June 12, 2015","true","63.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While both games involve planet exploration, and creating a base, and surviving and thriving, eventually making a profit, that's where the similarity ends.  Both games play alot alike in those aspects.  And both are quite fun with the "base" demands of the game.  As they both play like Space City sims.  If you like games like Banished, or maybe even Cities:Skylines (A bit of a stretch) you would probably enjoy both games.\n\nNow for the huge differences.  Planetbase plays alot like a simulator.  The base game is a bit more difficult, as you need more juggling to keep your base alive, as more colonists arrive, you need to balance alot of aspects such as food production, Oxygen production, Electricity production, water ect.  Even though the new colonists are a welcome sign to your base, they are also a detriment.  Your colonists themselves handle as you would expect them to.  They work to the best of their abilities, but need the basics including some relaxation to keep from losing morale.  The lower their morale, or the more injuries they have, the slower they will work.  But they are astronauts, and know what their job is.  They also aren't afraid to share beds, or other equipment. You also have to grow food for your astronauts, or create bio meat for your team to survive\n\nSpace Colony on the other hand is more like Planetbase if it was on the Jerry Springer show.  The astronauts all have their own set of skills, and likes and dislikes.  The base game seems easier, but you have to deal with clashing personalities, and each astronaut has a very flamboyant personality.  And part of the job in the game is to get your astronauts to go talk to each other on couches, to help them gain friendships.  Some you get to fall in love with each other, and they all need separate assigned beds or they won't sleep.  You also have to deal with what seems like constant spawning of aliens, which will destroy your equipment in your rooms.  As far as food production, in this game, you build a mower, and you need to find plants growing on the planet and the mower turns the plants into green space juice.\n\nPersonally I find Planetbase to be the much more enjoyable game of the 2.\n\nSpace Colony 5/10\nPlanetbase 9/10","May 24","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a fan of other Firefly titles like 'Stronghold' you might like this game. The game is older, but still plays pretty well.

Most are simple but take time.\nI was a previous fan of this game and just recently bought it for my collection.\n\nIf you're into tasks/resource management, and a focus on people/team management, you might like this game.","May 10","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
