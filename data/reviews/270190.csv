"http://steamcommunity.com/id/girldoesrant/recommended/270190/","girldoesrant","girldoesrant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/girldoesrant/","270 products in account","Honestly, I wanted to like this. The setup was there for a pretty intriguing game in the beginning. Two young sisters are left home alone by their parents and find a strange gift waiting at the front door. They take the gift inside to reveal two toys, which they then proceed to play with. They are suddenly attacked until one of the girls finds herself waking in a twisted world, forced to desperately search for her missing sister.\n\nThe atmosphere--particularly in the beginning--is very good. Strange, haunting landscapes. Great sound effects. Some pretty awesome artwork and interesting stylized cutscenes. But the glamor wears pretty thin, pretty fast.\n\nThe game is point-and-click, so it's to be expected that some of your goals may be obscure. You might have to do a bit of clicking and travelling around to get it. But there are also puzzles that really try your patience. Not so much challenging as simply time-consuming and frustrating (get ready to spend a hint--and you only get three--on navigating a complex maze with your mouse in total darkness and instant reset every time you touch the walls).\n\nNevermind the awful grammar (seriously, I understand that English is not the first language here, but if you're charging money, take the time to grammar-check. There are plenty of places online and offline that you can get your stuff checked for free). On that note, the narrative script is poorly written. Not just for the grammatical errors, but for its lack of consistency. One minute it's taking itself incredibly seriously, with a darkier-edgier tone. The next, it uses words that sound awkward and infantile in a tone that sounds like the narrator is intentionally hamming up his performance.\n\nOf course, if a game is going to frustrate you with its mechanics, it should have a solid story to keep you engaged. This one falls woefully short. It meanders around with a barely coherent story and a rushed, tacked on preachy ending about the responsability of raising children or personal morality or ethics of something or other or whatever, Oh hey, look it's the end!","June 3, 2015","false","4.7"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","34","40","0","0"

Most of this is me starting over again and again while I was recording my walkthrough videos.  With that in mind, I want to share my thoughts about this game with you.\n\nFirst: Are you are a fast action, first person shooter, explode first ask questions later kind of person?\nIf you said yes and get bored reading a review half way through then this isn't the game for you.\n\nThis is a point and click adventure puzzle game.  There is no combat mechanic in it.  The game makes you think.  So if you enjoy puzzles and creative and/or critical thinking then this may be something you like.\n\n\nSecond: Are you used to games holding your hand?  Do you skip the dialog knowing the answer is in the journal or marked on the map for you?\nIf you said yes then this may not be the game for you either.\n\nThis game has a story and a plot.  This game has a clear direction your character is going in.  The difference is that it doesn't tell you what that is.  The character has no clue what is going on and so why should the game tell you?\n\nThird: Are you a snob for perfect grammar and spelling?  Do you judge a game by its sound effects? music? graphics?\nIf you said yes then this may not be the game for you either.\n\nThis game was created by a polish company.  Words, Spelling, and Grammar don't always translate well the first time.  The development team is working on fixing that of course, but people like to take their shots when they can.  It's a translation issue not an intelligence issue.  Also the game isn't full of CGI or motion capture cut scenes.  They use very well done stills and limited animation paired with an excellent narrator and music to get the mood across.\n\n\nThere will always be someone who has something bad to say about a game.  Everyone is entitled to their opinions.  But look carefully at what they are saying before you judge the game by their words.  This game is thought out, well designed, and the challenges require observation, problem solving, and some skill.  Some of the puzzles are static puzzles, others are random,  but no puzzle is repeated in the game.\n\ntl:dr ?\nIf this is where you skipped to don't buy the game.  It isn't a game for you.\n\nIf you are here for a summary? ok then.\nClassic Point and Click Adventure Puzzle.  A throwback to the 90s\nGood graphics and music set the mood and theme for the game.\nControls? they are exact, no room for error\nReplay ability? low unless you are a completionist and want those achievements!\n","October 20, 2014","true","31.8"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","2"

Because the world is so dark and so full of fears that it's hard to describe.\n\nIndeed, the graphisms are really helping to set the ambiance of the game: like a drawing or like a painting, the cutscenes are mainly in black and white while the game itself is more colored yet, it's not like you're on a sunny beach or in a green countryside.\n\nIt's not really a HO game, because there are only two scenes. It's more a little adventure, with puzzles that you can solve easily because every solution is in the game.\n\nEverything is really well done.... apart these:\n- No skip for cutscenes - really?\n- The flashlight game is annoying without checkpoint and narrow lines (easy to touch the border and pouf! Back to square one!)\n- The minigames with the cubes to put on yellow lights aren't easy. You don't click on where you want to go. Nope, you have to click on the side of the moving cube to make sure it goes up, down, up, right... unfortunately, you click on the right, but not enough on the right, so you go up or left and touch a cube you shouldn't... and ending stuck.

From the moment the game loads the first odd cut scene, you know you are in for something weird, twisted, and probably not going to make alot of sense. That doesn't stop this title from packing everything you love about the genre into the game though. You have items that can be combined, puzzles, finding hidden objects, and feeling plenty lost 90% of the time. Veterans of the genre may enjoy the challenge that 1Heart offers, being a game that is very stingy with its hint system for better or worse. Those like me, who have some experience but only play on occasion may want to keep a handy guide on stand by as it is very easy to feel lost and confused as to what to do next. Despite this though, the puzzles are enjoyable, the game sticks to its theme unabashedly, and the voice acting guides the story, even if I found it slightly cheesy at times. In all 1Heart is a strange and twisted tale, it requires patience, luck, and most of all, lots of clicking. The game is well designed and looks fantastic. Just be aware of the nature of the beast.

Just not good enough to recommend.\n\nThe gameplay is point and click puzzling solving which is actually pretty solid. The main problem is that the puzzles range in difficulty from easy to just plain crazily convuluted and overally complex. This makes the game feel tedious and frustrating. The challenge is all over the map and it breaks the game in my mind.\n\nThe game is relatively short, but I feel the price tag is justified for the amount of time you'll probably spend as you try to trudge through the puzzles. The game has a lot of gore, but they went a bit overboard with it, and it doesn't feel scary at all because of it. I do, however, feel that the art syle works for what they were trying to achieve and is one of the main highlights. The story is fragmented and poorly delivered, with no closure at the end.\n\nIt has no replayability. There is literally nothing different if you play the game a second time, unless you want to try and replay it for some achievements. Hardly seems worth it to randomly click the screen 5,000 times for a single lousy achievement. The "play the game for three hours" achievement seems bugged, so this screws those who likes to try and get a 100% rating in games.\n\nLastly, I had minor issues with the game in terms of funcationality. There's no options menu to fix the screen resolution, sound, etc. You're forced to play in full screen. This would be fine if my game didn't crash when I tried to alt tab out if it was necessary. This wasn't always the case, and luckily the game's auto saving is good, otherwise it would be a complete trainwreck.\n\nAlthough an honest attempt was made and there are some good points, "tedious" is really the best way I can describe this as a whole.","March 22","false","11.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The story is intriguing and I was fairly satisfied with the ending (though it could have been better). I WANT to like this game, but I can't.\nI love point and clicks, they have always been my favourite kind of game so I was rather excited to play this game. Boy, was I disapointed in its excecution.\nThe biggest issue is just that some of the puzzles are too convoluted or complicated in places, almost to the point of not making sense. Several puzzles I forced, but most I just had to look up a walkthrough. This usually isn't too big a deal for me, but it's highly agravated by some very minor things, for instance there is no indicator that you can pick up ANY of the objects you can pick up. This becomes a problem when those objects blend in with the environment or just look like nothing important. Another annoying thing is that items must be used in a very specific way: ex. you need frog's blood, you get an axe, you try to kill the frog using the axe, "what was I thinking?!", goes on merry way, later in the game gets butcher knife, that knife magically works on the frog! It's so bad, it's to the point where you will do something that seems logical and it fails, why? Because you need to do this task in a very specific way with a specific item. The other big thing hindering gameplay in the lack of hints. There are a total of 5 hints in the game, so far as I can tell, after that you get nothing. I had used all of the hints within the first 10 minutes of the game which was part of the reason I had to look up a walkthrough. The number of hints given just isn't enough considering the difficulty of the puzzles, if the hints would regenerate over time the game wouldn't be so frustrating.\nAnother critism I have is that you need to do actions multiple times in order to complete a task that could just be done all at once. It's a minor thing, but it's annoying to get 2 batteries (which look like one item in the inventory) and have to load them into the radio one at a time, just cut the crap, if you use an item to do something you should only have to use it once to get the job done.\nAnother small thing, is that there are a lot of grammatical errors in the descriptions (and I think at least one typo in a cutscene). This is such an easy thing to remedy while making a game; if you don't speak English and you make a game, just put out an advertisement saying you want someone to proofread your script, there are lots of people in the community, myself included, who would be willing to proofread your game FOR FREE. It's such a small thing but it does hurt the quality of your game.\nAll in all, these flaws amount to something that seriously hurts the game, like I said I want to like this game, and it was enjoyable and very atmospheric for the first 5-10 minutes, but by the end I was so frustrated it distracted me from any atmosphere there was. I repeat: I was actually creeped out at the beginning of the game and by the end I did not care, I just wanted to finish the game.\nIf really difficult puzzles are your thing you'll like it, if not it's not really worth your time.","July 8, 2015","false","6.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Whilst it's not exactly believable the parents would just HERP DERP leave their darling kiddies to go on a random holiday, the atmosphere of the game is well drawn for this point and click.\n\nThe scenes seem to be oil painted, using dark tones and chaotic strokes, and the music permeates the background as you go on this adventure, helping shape the mood of the game.\nNow I really like the narrator's voice, though I find myself getting bored quite fast as it is slow paced. Not much really happens. You move from scene to scene, see some creepy looking objects, and the slowness of it, and lack of creeping fear in the background actually takes away the  sense of dread the game is clearly aiming to achieve. I don't feel that dread. I get more bored the further I make it through the scenes.\n\nI also think the dialogue is a real letdown to what could otherwise be a good game. It's badly done. Like, really badly done. You can't help but notice how amazingly bad it is. I feel they didn't do much research on the English language at all.\nThe puzzles are quite good. Not so difficult but not so easy, either.\n\nPros\n\nNice, gothic style of graphics. Environments are moody and atmospheric.\nRealistic controls\nCreepy music\nGood voice actor/narrator.\nStory has potential.\nPuzzles progress well.\n\nCons\n\nDialogue/writing feels off.  Incorrect or awkward use of words in sentences, and sometimes conjunctions/words are omitted, so it's not often grammatically correct.\nHeartbeat sound isn't in synch with heart.\nDoesn't seem to be a way to save your progress or know if you missed anything in a former scene.\n\nTL;DR\n\nOverall VerdictA game that has a lot of potential, but sadly falls flat of what it can deliver. It's not very scary, and frankly, it's pretty boring. A shame, because the voice actor is good, and the drawings are nice. What especially dragged this game down was the bad use of  English language. For me, it ruined the game, but for others, maybe it's not so noticeable.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/jigglesandgiggles#curation","November 14, 2015","false","10.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

There are also various places where you need to click on exactly the right pixel: I  in my mind figured out how to solve something, but because I didn't click the right place, thought I got it wrong. A frustrating waste of time until I thought to try again.\n\nFinally, the achievements require you to look carefully at a walkthrough. I thought I was doing it right, but still missed a collectible, and after you pass a certain point you cannot go back without restarting the game.","November 15, 2015","false","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Many times the game lacks internal consistency, letting you use a tool for one purpose in one region and then not in the same way in another, turning much of the game into a guess and check that I certainly didn't find enjoyable. The worst puzzles (without spoiling anything) count less on the player thinking their way through and instead rely on motor skills in ways that can only lead to annoyance for most, and perhaps bragging rights to few.\n\nUnless you're desperate for a horror-themed adventure game, I'd say pass.","August 15, 2015","false","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But let's dig a little deeper here.\n\nThe art in this game is absolutely fascinating. The game boasts the creepiest and most unnerving visuals offered by any Point and Click title on Steam. Coupled with eerie music, the atmosphere is a complete 10/10. The story is also very note worthy, and it's interesting enough to keep you plugging through the minor issues and glitches. The game takes an extremely dark twist towards the end, which is very satisfying when you reach it. There is no happy ending here.\n\nThe puzzles and riddles can be fairly complex at times, and some players may find themselves frustrated by this aspect. However, I've personally played Point and Click games with tougher challenges so I was not phased by this. In fact, I completed the game twice and attempted a speedrun thereafter.\n\nThat brings me to the next point that 1HEART is also very short. As you can see, my two and a half runs clocked me in at 4.4 hours; roughly 1 and a half hours per playthrough. That being said, I cannot recommend the game for the asking price of $10.99 CAD; although the effort put into the artwork nearly makes the price worth it... if only the game were longer. However, I can, and most definitely do, recommend this game on sale or in a bundle. It's a great little atmospheric horror Point and Click that deserves more attention and better recognition.\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","October 22, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game relies on the players curiosity as the story slowly unfolds with every completed puzzle.\nA decent length for a $10 game. The only big downfall for me was being in a very very small walls maze and not being allowed to touch the sides or you are transported back to the beginning of the 'puzzle' and not to mention you cannot see where you are going and there is no option to lower mouse sensitivity - gg. I did spend much longer than I should have on this part.

Many of them were free online flash games, so thats the experience I went into this game with. First things first. Do you like a challange? If you do this may or may not be up ur alley...\nThis game has the tendency to throw a lot of items at you without any explination, hints, or dialogue that might lead you forward. Most items needed are hidden, as in the blend very well in the back ground. other times the damn items are not picked up, even if you have clicked them 2 or 3 times. for example,\n*SPOILER*\nthe crow bar thing you need is next to the vent of the raised city. I clicked that ♥♥♥♥ing thing 4 times. the 5th time I guess I clicked it in the right spot because I picked it up.\n*SPOILER END*\nA game should not be hard, becuase the mechanics are ♥♥♥♥ed up. and as for any direction in the game, there is none. you basically wander about not knowing where to go and what to do next. maybe thats a apart of the ambiance. who knows. it left me wishing there was more story line in the form of notes, or messages. I felt like I was just doing random things that had no real significance. (yeah i know its  point and click, the point is to solve random puzzles) but some good PCs have story to them or reference other storeis or events.\n\nNext comes the graphics. The digitially drawn graphics were nice. they added to the creepy factor and the dream like atmosphere. I wish there was a bit more creepy invovled but its fine the way it is.\nMy biggest problem was the grammar. (ignore my bad grammer, i dont care suckas) throughout the game, there were rubish sentences and misspellings, like "the doors ale closed"  "ale" closed dont you mean "are" closed? and others with no subject verb agreement and in some cases, the use of wrong words. I know they are polish, but still. If you are going to have an english version, get a translater, not google translate. The narrartor was cool, I really liked his voice.\nI dont see my self playing this game again. which brings me to a close.\nTL:DR\nthe game as messed up mechanics, and you dont always pick up an item after clicking it. the bad grammar was distracting but the narrator and graphics were cool. The lack of intructions and dialogue in the form of notes or messages, made it feel like I was wandering about aimlessly.\nso I give it a 5/10. I wouldn't really recommend it. its problems are not bugs per say but fixing the game would require making a new one.\nalso the creators could have gone so much further with the ghost girl, and other NPCs. you dont encounter anyone but a few animals.\n","October 14, 2014","false","7.4"," 26 of 52 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","26","52","0","0"

Using a hint to teleport me to an area isn't much of a help. The hint system was a plus for me, but the hints given weren't that big of a deal.\nPlus, the ending. What happened? All my efforts for nothing? No "defeating the boss" or "killing of the psychotic bad guy"? Nope. Just another kidnap and the game's over.\nAlthough this game is a greenlight game, a little more effort would make this game perfect.

(For example, putting a random CD in a machine used to crush large objects, and then fitting its shattered pieces perfectly into a puzzle to disable a machine keeping you from a key item. The CD just HAPPENS to shatter into perfect little chunks to complete a man-made puzzle? Puh-leeze.) It was at that point I gave up on the game.

I wonder what this is all about!" But directly after these points you feel like, "Oh, we're.... we're not going to do anything with that? Oh, we, we just leave that there then. Um, alright then...."\n\nThere are many avenues that this game could have taken, but it seems to have chosen the most mundane one. I mean, it could have been better if it was arrived to in a better manner. I just didn't feel it. At no point in this game did I feel the slightest inclination of fear.\n\nThe voice over added nothing, very monotone, no real life. Also, I would figure an english speaker, which I only assume the voice over was, would be able to recognize the poor translation before recording the script. There are several blatant grammatical errors that are spoken, how did that get by?\n\n1HEART game devs, you really should have presented this game to a native English speaker before release. It's distracting from the story to see these errors.\n\nThe art was enjoyable at most parts. Though the drawings of the girl and the villian seemed very silly, not scary at all, it just seemed poorly done.\n\nThese being said. some of the puzzles were actually really fun to work through! Really made you think.\n\nBut other challenges were impossible. A tool you find at the very end of the game is needed for a room in the middle? How is one supposed to know this? Theres nothing to lead one to think that this should be the case. The back and forth in this game gets a little out of hand.\n\nTL:DR\n\nPoor English writing, zero scare factor, decent puzzles. Pick up another point and click, like "I have no mouth and I must scream", or "Deponia". This one needed a few more weeks in game testing..... in the States or England, not Poland.","December 18, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
