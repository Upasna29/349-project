Rather slow paced; though I guess that fits with the intent of the game. You probably need to read the manual; that's no chore though as it's short and well presented. Puzzles are optional, and just as well as some are rather hard.\n\nEdit: now I‚Äôve progressed a bit, just to tell you a bit about the teachings. One should always be cautious with spiritual things,   so keep in mind this is just my opinion and Im only a moderately spiritual person at best.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the teachings here are the real deal. It‚Äôs easy to spend thousands on teachings that are worthless at best and harmful at worst.  The teachings here seem very well presented and well chosen.  I‚Äôve strayed of the spiritual path a bit recently,  but I didn‚Äôt expect this game to help at all as Im a Christian, would never consider converting away, and I don‚Äôt believe in syncretism (mixing religions).  I just thought the game might be an easy way to learn a little about Asian faiths.  To my surprise though,  the teachings seem to be helping me renew my spiritual hunger. I now have a better grasp of why certain mystics say that deep down the different spiritual paths are similar.","May 14","true","8.0"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","27","35","2","0"

You want to "help and change the world" - don't exit the game, you'll start anew. Developer posted a note about how it's similar to death and rebirth, but it's not. It's boring, frustrating and not the way the incremental games work (how about that concept of "life, death and rebirth"?). Give us the right to choose if we want to save or reset the world.\nSecond. Puzzles. In what world are sliding puzzles with no original image and tens of pieces are relaxing? Are sliding puzzles relaxing at all for anyone? How I'm supposed to know which piece with blue sky on it should be where? How should I solve the puzzle with random pile of leaves? By moving all the pieces around and hoping it will work out somehow? 400 black pieces jigsaw I solved once was more inspiring and relaxing than this.\nThird. It's always fullscreen with fixed resolution. Well at least alt+tab works.\nFourth. The only "spiritual learning" and "personal growth" you'll get from this game are from motivational stories and quotes, which you'll get after solving (RAGE!!!) puzzles. No pain, no gain? No thanks! I can google "personal growth quotes" myself.\nThe good parts of this game are music and art, but considering all of the above it's just not enough.","May 26","false","2.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","3"

None of them tell you what to expect; only how to advance towards the right and "open up new territory". No goals or motives explained. No purpose for doing anything. There are a few puzzles encountered as you move towards the right (including one inane slider one which I couldn't be bothered to finish). Then I found myself unable to advance anymore because, despite following instructions to "click on the orbs" or whatever, the new territory just wouldn't "open up".\n\nPerplexed, I then took a look at the game description on the product page in Steam, and it contains instructions not found anywhere at all in the game. So, what is this? Players have to look at the product page description in order to know what they're in for, or supposed to do?! Unbelievable. (And even then, the product description doesn't tell you how to do it.)\n\nI did like the art style and pastoral feel to the entire thing, but the instructions (or lack thereof) are so mind-blowingly frustrating they practically cancel out any positive utility this game is supposed to provide.\n\nDisclaimer: Game played for free, many thanks to my dear friend Unpageable","May 26","false","0.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","4"
