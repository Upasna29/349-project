You are the gangleader of the Third Street Saints. The Saints are no longer just a brutal and effective criminal operation but now a fully-fledged media empire with their time split equally between doing dirt and setting up legitimate businesses and a popular line of merchandising.\nAfter a bank heist gone wrong, the Saints find themselves in Steelport, butting heads with a local crime group known as the Syndicate. From there it is the classic rise to power story.\nThe appearance and personality of the Saints' leader is completely up to you, thanks to the character editor. You can make him or her look genuinely cool, or a complete abomination. If you want to change your look, or even your sex, visit a plastic surgeon in the city and change it. If you want a new outfit, there are shops full of every type of fashion imaginable.\nMissions place you in increasingly unpredictable situations. It starts out fairly low-key with a raid on a military base to steal weapons for the gang, but it finishes with an explosive finale involving tanks, jets and city-levelling explosions. In between, there is a zombie outbreak, a trip inside a Tron-like computer world and much more, it gets wilder and more varied.\nThere is also an element of choice to the decisions you make. Certain missions see you choosing between two options that will affect the story, sometimes in quite dramatic ways.\nThe game has a lot of replay value, after finishing the main story you are able to do a lot of side missions, e.g. car-stealing missions and assassinations.\nThe best way to play Saints Row: The Third is to play with a friend. The co-op action and the careful attention to detail in the co-op mechanics are masterful. It is easy to drop in and out of a friend’s game and the way progress is tracked is very smart. If you join a game where the other person is further along in the plot than you are, you can still play a plot mission with them.\nThe dialogue between the characters is consistently hilarious. The game is packed with in-jokes, meta humor and constantly swerves into almost surreal territory.\nThe graphics may not be mind blowing, instead the game really shines with the sound. Everything sounds great from the gun battles to the snippets of incidental speech that you get when wandering around. The voice acting takes it up a notch though with some truly memorable performances. The best thing is the music selection though. A great selection of dance, hip hop, indie and metal are on offer from the in-game radio stations.\nOverall I think the game is fantastic. It just gives you so much to do and a lot of fun if you play with a friend. Saints Row: The Third is worth to buy.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 7/10\nGameplay 8/10\nAtmosphere 9/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","September 26, 2014","true","45.6"," 192 of 206 people (93%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","93","192","206","18","1"

I think I played about the first five minutes, and then bought it- seriously it was that good. This was one of the only games that I actually tried to play slllooowwwwllly, because I wanted to "savor" the storyline. I would play 1 mission, then go on 5 or 6 sidequests just to make that main storyline last as long as I could. I love the voiceover acting, the writing, the graphics, the humor... where do I stop? Granted, the humor in this game is at times dark, and sexual... so just FYI, but if you're the person that enjoys a good "edgy" joke, you will love the witty banter between the characters in this game.\n\nA lot of people have tried to ask about the likeness to GTA IV... and called this a GTAIV copycat... well maybe... if you could say that GTAIV got an actual good port to PC, and maybe if you could say that GTAIV was actually funny... and maybe if the missions actually made sense and just walking around didn't absolutely frustrate the living Hotel Echo Lima Lima out of me. Also, a big part was the driving for me. GTAIV took the same car, and just copied it with different skins over and over- this game actually makes each car a little different, the handling, the speed, the features- and everything is customizable! You can put NOS on cars, change the rims, the decals, the paint, the color of the windshields... there are literally endless posibilities of driving around your pimped out car- also, it is so much easier to drive. If this was a GTAIV copycat, then SR did a MAJOR overhaul in the coding and scripting system for the driving because it is a breeze and joy to drive around in this game! :)\n\nSynopsis: Funny, Witty, Enjoyable, (Did I mention Co-op camaign?! Only 2 people though :Notice) you will laugh, cry and connect with the characters and be able to play it over and over again. Do yourself a favor and get it- you won't regret :).","November 27, 2013","true","110.3"," 201 of 219 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","201","219","0","0"

There is a perfect balance of pragmatism and ludicrousness inherent to each and every aspect of the game. The mosaic of realistic and ridiculous themes is expertly crafted into one of the most enjoyable games in existence, let alone in the sandbox genre. All but the most extremely discerning gamers should be able to enjoy it.\n\nOne of the first features of Saints Row: The Third that will jump out at you is the fact it is full of preposterous themes, demonstrated not only in the narrative and atmospheric elements, but also the gameplay itself. And so, you definitely aren't supposed to approach this game seriously. That becomes painfully obvious once you learn that you can hop out of a speeding jet and crash face first into the middle of a city with no parachute... only to bounce up and run down the street naked, caving in people's skulls with giant purple sex toys.\n\nYet despite being a heavy-handed and purposeful parody of itself, the narrative of the game is actually entertaining and logically sensible (by that I mean it adheres to the logic of the gameworld, not real life). And the ludicrousness doesn’t ever get so totally out of hand that it starts to feel like a ”simulator” game; there is always some semblance of a purpose and direction. Saints Row: The Third is a good example of how a game doesn’t have to be serious, but also can have an entertaining and somewhat logical narrative.\n\nThere is also a number of factors which add a significant layer of customization, progression, and statistics to the game— all of which contribute to increasing the overall epicness of the experience. For one, there is a wide range of customizing ability, from your character to your vehicles. Many hours can be spent just changing the theme of your gang. There is also a system of XP and level progression, which is uncommon in the genre, but synthesizes perfectly in Saints Row: The Third. You can use your level-ups to customize certain abilities of your character, and if you devote enough time, you can eventually make yourself invincible purely through the level system (not cheats/codes).\n\nFurthermore, the gameworld in Saints Row: The Third is a very enjoyable sandbox to play in, and there is a lot of potential for riotous fun to be had. The gameworld is large enough to be interesting, but not so large it becomes a burden to traverse. To keep you busy between campaign missions, there are dozens of side-missions of various gameplay styles which add pleasant diversity. Outside the primary and secondary missions, there are numerous minigames and challenges (stunting, base jumping, racing, streaking, etc.) which all contribute to creating an environment where you can spend hours of gameplay just messing around and having fun, without actively pursuing missions or progressing the game.\n\nAnd another amazing feature of this game is the ability to play the actual campaign in co-op mode.  Instead of just messing around in the sandbox with friends, you can actually beat the game together.\n\nThere is also a lot of DLC, which ranges from cosmetic additions to full-blown extra campaigns. I would say it is definitely worth it to get the GOTY edition right from the start.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","February 6","true","77.0"," 122 of 137 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","122","137","2","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninmurai/recommended/55230/","ninmurai","Morpheus, Lord of Dreams","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninmurai/","282 products in account","Saints Row: The Third. I thought it was a very good game. The thing that got me the most was the comical humor. The costumes and wardrobes, to the sexual references and balancing dead bodies with exaggerated weapon effects. I found this game to be a LOT beter compared to Saints Row and Saints Row II. If follows the time line, which is always a plus. The amount of things you can do, in my opinion, is much more and better than GTA. GTA is more on a serious note, which is good; Saints Row: The Third has some serious moments, but knows how to offer a laugh and good time with a balance.\n\nThe Story Line is pretty simple and basic, but not as generic as you would expect. You have a mixture of things, from saving your Homies, to fighting Gangs, Police, Military, Politicians, Zombies and Aliens. The gangs, especially one in particular are trying to take turf. What kind of gang isn't? The Genki line I found the most fun. It's basically like a game show arena. You fight your wat through enemies as well as the environments. It's definitely rewarding in the end, but not as much as it should be. In the end, you begin to gather forces for a take over. A bloody, deadly and annoying battle takes place.\n\nThe Combat System was very fun. Shooting duel pistols at enemies and watching them fly across the street. The Genki Mobile went shoots flames around all sides of the car as you drive, leaving a flaming inferno of destruction in your path. Falling from a disintergrating plane and shooting people as you fall with style. Fighting in wrestling rings with other gang members. Or you can do it with classic style by running them over with your cars and going on a shooting rampage. Some people may frown on it, but it is only a game after all. It could even relieve some frustrations.\n\nDidn't have much of an Online Experience. It's pretty difficult to find others willing to play or willing to stay. So, unless you have a friend to play this with, I would recommend that more. At least if you want the achievements that go with this.\n\n4/5 Singleplayer   2/5 Online/Coop","October 4, 2014","true","61.1"," 87 of 99 people (88%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","88","87","99","10","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/55230/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Take a moment to picture this scenario; you’re in a helicopter hovering above the roof a several-story tall penthouse that’s currently owned by a rival gang of yours. You then leap out, skydive downwards and release your parachute before finally landing and beating up everyone with a ten-feet long, pink ♥♥♥♥♥. And yet that’s only a sparse indication to just how ludicrous and over-the-top Saints Row 3 truly is. Of course, this should come as no surprise to anyone who played its precursors, but irrespective if you’re familiar with Saints Row’s crazy antics or not, the third iteration is unlike any other game this year – and it’s playful tone and hysterical characters will have you in stitches.\nSaints Row 3 still centers on a small gang of violent, yet eccentric criminals who go by the name “The Saints”. But after a ridiculously crazy opening, the Saints find themselves in the troubled town of Steelport  and are poised to overthrow a notorious crime syndicate called, well, “The Syndicate”. The premise is incredibly straightforward, but it’s the cast of characters and sublime dialogue that really makes Saints Row 3 so memorable. Riding shotgun with you throughout the game is a mash-up of crooks, gangsters, computer nerds and a pimp whose voice may or may not be auto-tuned. The story takes a while to get moving, but getting wrapped in Saints Row 3’s narrative is not mandatory in order to enjoy the game.\nIn case you absolutely haven’t heard or seen anything with the name Saints Row on it — it’s a sandbox, open-world experience. You’re set loose in a madhouse of a city and free to tackle missions, side activities, cause some serious commotion or regain control over large chunks and city squares of Steelport. The game also features some fairly basic third-person shooter mechanics. There’s no cover system in place, but you can shoot up enemies with a massive selection of firearms and gadgets, perform dive rolls and rush in and take out enemies using hand-to-hand combat. Little has changed from Saints Row 2 in that regard, but the combat is still satisfying nonetheless.\nSaints Row 3’s design is heavily focused on advancing your character and your supremacy over Steelport, since completing missions grants you money which you can spend on a huge selection of attributes and skill-boosting upgrades. Also, completing vital story missions unlocks “cribs”where you can customize your load out and much else. This all feeds into the Reputation system, which allows you to level up and get access to more powerful abilities.\nAnother strong component of Saints Row 3 is the mission variety. While some objectives boil down to kill x, escort z or defend y, there are still some very enjoyable missions and set-pieces that punctuate important story moments. You’ll get to infiltrate nuclear plants, man a good number of ground and aerial vehicles to carry out large-scale assaults, defend a freighter from incoming enemies and much more. The missions are mostly easy and feature a generous checkpoint system, and you can always take on a good number of side missions for extra cash and rep.\nThe AI of your friendly gang members –aptly called “homies”– was one of the biggest complaints leveled towards Saints Row 2, and though it’s not perfect here, it’s still been improved significantly and gang members now drop enemies at a more consistent pace.\nAdversaries on the other hand are about as inept and dumb as they can be; not running away from grenades or failing to respond as you fill them with lead. To make matters worse, you face an extremely small number of enemies — there are standard goons, more armored ones, and gigantic, hulk-like enemies dubbed “Brutes”. As a result, the combat loses some its luster after a while, so the real variety comes from the vehicle or on-rails-sequences you’ll infrequently take part in.\nSaints Row 3 looks good for an open-world title, with excellent animations and colorful explosions – which is a good thing since you’ll be seeing tons and tons of explosions – and the game also has one of the deepest character customization editors I’ve seen all year, and your custom appearance is reflected to a hundred-percent in the cut scenes. The game also scales itself well to lower-end machines, and features support from Direct X9 to Direct X11.\nThe world, however, still looks slightly dull here and there, and the physics are often sporadic and glitchy from time to time. Load times also come in a large abundance and on the whole, Saints Row 3 is pretty, but still has a few too many rough edges.\nWith excellent writing, strong variety, lots of stuff to do and an incredibly fun and endearing attitude, Saints Row 3 is one of the most quirky games to come out in 2011. The combat could still be deeper and the AI is still noticeably weak and coupled with some technical deficiencies and a disappointing extra mode, Saints Row 3 strictly settles for being great, but it that’s more than enough to warrant a recommendation.","April 22, 2014","true","87.8"," 73 of 80 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","73","80","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/55230/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Some sandbox games are well respected for their realism. After all, it takes a lot to create a city, populate it, give players a chance to live in a virtual parody of reality, and at the same time do so in a way that draws players in an makes them feel they truly are in an enclosed living breathing world. Well grounded characters have to blend together with a physics engine that makes sense, because players are always going to be searching for that one thing that feels too inconsistent with what we know about the world today. So it's fairly impressive how well Saints Row: The Third draws in players considering that every ounce of realism is tossed right out the door within the first ten minutes, giving players an amazingly wild ride that features some of the most memorable (and believable) characters you'll ever have the pleasure of playing with in a sandbox game.\n\nDon't get fooled by the fact that this is the third game in the series; even though the plot picks off right where the other games left off players are treated to a nice summary of the Saints' accomplishments prior to this installment. Having reached the height of their fame and popularity the local gang has become a bit full of themselves. They're now robbing banks with masks that look like their faces, cutting movie deals, and just generally getting used to the good life. This complacency eventually gets them into quite a bit of trouble, and soon the Saints find themselves in a new, unfamiliar city having to work their way back from the ground up.\n\nApart from the main story being a little predictable, it's a fantastic ride through and through. Part of this has to do with how over-the-top the action is in just about every situation. Stealing UAV bombing drones, skydiving from helicopters to crash parties and freefalling from an airplane while shooting through falling debris to kill rival gang members in mid air. These all set the tone at an early point in the game that the action is going to be consistently over the top and the player will get the experience all the best parts of it. With the mind already suspending a lot of belief that any of these things could ever happen it's easy to believe that the storyline is just background fluff for the experience, but the character interactions are so genuine that it's hard not to really feel for the Saints' cause.\n\nThere's absolutely no time wasted in any of the dialogue, no fillers with useless information, no string of swearing just for the need to be edgy, and in a world where players can dress up like vampire hookers driving a ice cream truck, while avoiding mutant hulks that throw people at you, being able to be to really connect with these characters so effortlessly is incredibly valuable.\n\nBut thankfully the character design isn't the only solid thing in Saints Row: The Third. Combat naturally plays a large role in attempting to carve out a gang empire and that's exactly where the game becomes additively satisfying. Guns are just about everywhere and take up the usual role in any third person shooter. There are sniper rifles, rocket launchers, pistols, machine guns, and all of them are simple as pointing and clicking away. Then, of course, you have weapons like the laser guided precision airstrike gun that summons up sharks, or mind-controlling squid gun (which naturally shoots out a squid which takes over any potentially hostile NPC). The sheer wackiness of some of the weapons that players get access to is both shocking and hilarious, and it's clear that only some sort of genius could ever come up with the vast array of weaponry featured in this game.\n\nMelee weapons offer a little bit more versatility this time around, as some attacks can be used indefinitely, while others have limited use but offer special attacks like an explosive knockback. Melee itself plays another huge role in the game, and is arguably the most defining feature of the franchise.\n\nFluid, over the top, and a lot of fun, melee moves mix up the typical shooting elements of the game to great effect. Drop kicking one enemy only to run over and take another as a hostage, all without changing weapons or being forced to handle different mechanics, makes tackling a large group of foes very easy. This is good, because players only ever seem to fight a small horde enemies every time.\n\nNaturally with weapons, cars, and gangsters come customization features, of which Saints Row 3 isn't remotely short of. Players are able to level up weapons, increasing both individual features and aesthetic looks over time. Vehicles on the other hand have just as many customization options as the player character does, and all of it is incredibly easy to control. Grabbing a car and tossing on a unique paint job is incredibly easy, and using cash earned in-game you can choose to tweak the frame of individual vehicles with little to no effort. Even those who are typically disinterested in visually tweaking cars should find that the quick and painless options offered make the process fairly fun.\n\nCharacter customization on the other hand is a completely different beast altogether. Outside of editing a characters general face, height, gender, voice and all the other usual suspects players are allowed to dress their characters to an amazing extent. Visiting clothing stores throughout the city will grant players the option of shopping from that particular style and anything from business attire, street clothing, bondage gear, or just plain strange costumes. The selection is fairly large, made better only by the fact that players will generally find these stores by bumping into them mid-exploration rather than simply searching them out by necessity.\n\nAnother fantastic point of customization in Saints Row: The Third is how players are allowed to manage their in-game finances, with an offering of more than just customized weapons and crazy looking hats. Players can also purchase property all over the city that generates revenue every hour, or serves as alternative safe houses where players can store vehicles, weapons, or clothing. It's one of many different rewards for exploration that doesn't come in the form of finding hidden items.\n\nGraphically there's not too much to be dissatisfied with when it comes to Saints Row: The Third, as it's an open world title that does everything it can to absolutely minimize any loading times. Naturally entering a special vehicle segments or a special indoor building will trigger a bit of loading, but for the most part players should find the entire experience relatively seamless. The soundtrack is also well done, being a great blend of scripted talk show radio work, satirical commercials, and real music. Special missions will often come along with a predetermined soundtrack, which sets the tone fairly well as long as you're in the mood to Kanye West or some other rap/rock artist.\n\nSaints Row: The Third is, simply put, absolutely insanity at its best. While some sandbox titles strive for realism, or destructive scale, Saints Row: The Third instead takes a combination of all the features that have defined sandbox games as of late (driving, shooting, wandering large setpiece cities) alongside a blend of everything that defines how memorably wacky a game can be. There's very little in this title that wont satisfy most gamers, and that the entire game can be run through with co-op just adds to the fun. Getting every property, finding each hidden item, wiping out every gang and finishing every mission will naturally take a bit of time but the best part about Saints Row: The Third isn't about the hours you intentionally invest, it's finding out how much time you've lost having fun without ever realizing it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=383235866\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","December 20, 2014","true","98.6"," 76 of 89 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","76","89","7","2"

There are plenty of giant purple bats, leather clad dancers, and awkward situations all done for the sake of comedy. You play as the head of a gang from the start, but really its a group of three tight friends that grows bigger to include a giant powerhouse, an ex FBI tech geek, a pretensions actor, a serious turncoat twin and an auto tuned pimp. These aren't just quest givers, you can call on them to help you on missions. When they're with you, they're smart enough to find cover in gun fights, take hostages and even steal a car to follow you when you drive off without them. When your "homies" fall, you need to pick them back up or lose the mission. There are frequent checkpoints, but with a game so fun, I don't mind if I die.\n\nThe franchise really took a step away from being just a lesser version of Grand Theft Auto. They upped the gameplay and the comedy. Where GTA 4 turned gritty and real, Saints Row went the silly fun route. You can take hostages to use them as human shields. Improve your aim by crouching down. Head shot any enemy for an instant kill. Otherwise the enemies will spin around hoping to find cover and forcing your aim to follow them. There are multiple flying take downs and the animation seems outstanding for something that has so many of them.\n\nThere is so much customization too. Everything from customizing your own look, to creating how your gang looks. If you want all thugs, go for it. If you want all space men or strippers. That's up to you. Their stats aren't affected. Its all just a look. Having your crew around makes an interesting mission even more fun. The whole thing is streamlined. Go to your PDA that will get a phone call sending you to a location on your GPS to start the mission. You'll find a wide variety in missions, fly to this location, take out a bunch of gang members, hop in a turret, drive through hostile territory, jump out of a plane ..... in a tank and shoot at people and other tanks as you fall. Then hop in a virtual world with a new weapon. Its always interesting and a few missions take place outside of the city in their own unique environments.\n\nSome missions end with a choice that really adds replay value. Do you get a one time sum of cash, or do you want a constantly generating smaller sum of cash. Do you want the aide of someone new or keep someone old? Even down to trivial things like discounts on car upgrades vs discounts on weapon upgrades or who you let live.\n\nThe city of Steelport is a bright, beautiful, vibrant and gritty city. It all depends what area you're in. The industrial zone  has no lights, while the tourist part has beautiful neon lights. The city really lights up at night and looks amazing while flying. As the game progresses, the sights change. You'll see a sunken aircraft carrier, a plane tail up and much more to remind you of just how you've affected the city.\n\nSince this is a new city, you'll need to take it over. How do you do that? Participating in side quests like racing cars or a turf war with one of the three rival gangs in the city. You can buy stores that count to the take over percentage. There are even score based games like insurance fraud and mayhem that have you rag dolling into cars or destroying property. When you own a percentage of the city, you'll make money for it every real life hour you play. Outside of controlling the city, you can participate in assassinations, car thefts and hijackings with a passenger, then hold them until you get a ransom.\n\nMoney for weapons becomes irrelevant. You'll always have more than enough ammo even if you never visit a gun store. What the money really goes to are upgrades. In the PDA menu you'll upgrade how much ammo you can have, what guns your crew has, your total health, how fast it regenerates, how much stamina you have and so much more. This is the expensive part of the game. Each gun has four levels of upgrade. The fourth level is always something silly like explosive bullets from a pistol.\n\nThere are plenty of weapons in six major types, melee, small, sub machine guns, shot guns, assault rifles, misc (rockets), sniper rifles and four types of throwable things like grenades. You can only have one of each weapon type equipped at a time, but that's more than enough. Some missions require you to use a rocket launcher and it won't just give you a launcher, it gives you unlimited rockets. Its one of the joys of this game. High powered weapons with big effects. Once the STAG army shows up, there are some even more creative weapons like a force rifle that when used it pushes away enemies and fully charged obliterates them. There's just so much variety here, even a tactical missile strike, but that's not nearly as fun as everything else.\n\nBosses are big brutes that can run right through you. They are pretty simple to take down though. Shoot them enough times and a quick button prompt will finish them off. The ones without guns will throw cars and benches around. The ones with guns carry flame throwers or heavy machine guns that thankfully jam. With them gone you can pick up their heavy weapons to use as your own, but the bigger the weapon, the slower you move. These weapons are worth the time for the power and fun they bring, especially the sticky bomb launcher.\n\nOn top of that, you can climb into vehicles, cars, motor cycles, trucks, but better than that are tanks, armored SUVs, helicopters and some futuristic hover jets and cycles. The hover jets and cycles have two modes, jet and hover. Its perfect from a gameplay standpoint, go fast or hover so you can easily take out slow moving ground units and land on a dime. The vehicles with weapons are a lot of fun to shoot with unlimited ammo, but there are cool downs. Tanks that pancake cars. Missiles that lock onto things and follow them. Its very enjoyable.\n\nThe characters in your crew are excellently voiced and your chemistry together really shines through. Sure they poke fun at one another, but they have some memorably fun times beyond just shooting things. Silly happy moments like singing to Sublime on the radio and Oleg revealing how he has met his intellectual equal while in a firefight. The bosses of the gangs are worthy characters in their own right. They really make cut scenes interesting.\n\nWith you playing a criminal and all, there is notoriety in stars. The cops won't just chase after you, but the gangs and STAG army will too. Police will send helicopters with snipers. Enemy gangs will even setup roadblocks to stop you. It gets to a chaotic level sometimes when a gang and an army are after you. All three factions including your own start to fight in giant wars that can have dozens of people. Its amazing to be a part of. The game makes good use of big environments so you can flank your enemies and they can flank you.\n\nSaints Row: The Third is an amazing and fun game with enough DLC to choke Godzilla. Its mostly all just cosmetic stuff. The Complete Pack has been $5, there's no reason not to pick it up, but with its comedy, its just not for kids.","January 22, 2015","true","21.8"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","49","53","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/-TiLT-/recommended/55230/","-TiLT-","tiLT * Tt eSPORTS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/-TiLT-/","236 products in account","After successfully taking over the town of Stillwater in the last game, the Saints popularity and brand has exploded. Billboards are everywhere, they have their own energy drink, and people stop them in the street for autographs even in the midst of battle.\n\nBut it's not easy being at the top, it just makes you a bigger target. During the first mission, a bank heist goes wrong, and you find yourself fighting rival gangs and a military force in a brand new city - Steelport. This is an industrial city with big skyscrapers, factories... and maniacs with rocket launchers.\n\nWhen you first bring up that world map, the art design and music instantly makes you think of Grand Theft Auto IV's map. But Saints Row isn't a realistic gritty sandbox where you pay bridge tolls and go bowling... it's more of an absurdest parody of the GTA games.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between the two franchises, is that here you get to live out your wildest character customisation dreams - which we'll always appreciate. There's an almost endless supply of facial tweaks, from eyelids to reptilian make-up... there's stacks of gestures and taunts... skinny and fat sliders, skin colours that include metallic yellow and green... and even a 'sex appeal' slider. There are also a stack of voices to choose from for your character. Most of our favourite voices are back from Saints Row 2, with one notable addition - the zombie.\n\nIt's quite an achievement that all of these clothes fit so well, with no clipping on all body types I tried. And there's something about seeing these crazy characters in cut scenes that not only makes this a very individual experience - but it just makes the main character seem even more insane then he/she already is. It also surprised me how well made these cut-scenes are, for a game that embraces the silly so much. The whole presentation is well done actually, and the selection of music on the radio stations is great too... but it's the mission music that really compliments the action perfectly.\n\nThe intro to this game is so exciting. In the first hour you'll rip a vault out of a bank, get kidnapped, parachute out of a plane, then shoot the window out of one coming towards you, take out everyone in it and then fight goons in mid air until you land in Steelport. They put a lot of work into those first couple of missions... and straight away you realise that everything looks better compared to the last game. There's a floppy, cartoony feel to the world and the character models; which you especially notice riding the sidewalk. All the models look more solid, with better animations in general. The cars look better too, with improved physics which makes for some excellent crashes.\n\nOnce you zoom around, you'll notice how smooth the world is. It's not beautiful but there's a lot on screen at once and there's a good draw distance, with a nice amount of detail. One thing that always bugged in me SR2 is the way vehicles would spawn and disappear as you looked left and right, which broke the world a bit for me. I noticed that they've fixed that.\n\nGetting in and out of cars is something that you do a LOT in a game like this, and here in Saints Row 3 you actually have a 'quick hijack' which lets you leap into vehicles instantly; and that sums up the overall concept of this game - which is that it doesn't want to waste your time, and tries to keep things as fun and fast as possible. There's even a 'warp to shore' mechanic so you don't waste time swimming. Developer Volition really does a good job of keeping the gameplay streamlined.\n\nEnemy AI is a bit hit and miss though, sometimes they won't notice you for a while, or they'll just stand out in the open. There's no cover system so their options are a bit limited anyway. And in most of the missions where you're fighting a bunch of goons, there are usually only 2 or 3 character types, which can't help but feel out of place for a game with such great customisation to your own character.\n\nThe story missions in Saints Row: The Third are full of variety. The best range from exciting base infiltrations, ambushes, jet missions and some other crazy stuff that I won't spoil for you. There's no longer any multiplayer VS which I don't think will be missed that much to be honest.. But now there is a wave mode.. called '♥♥♥♥♥D MODE' where you'll face off against a variety of foes that grow in size, and shrink... in a bunch of situations. It's horribly unbalanced but undeniably fun.\n\nNow, this is a very crude game, and I have to say I've really wrestled with my morals on this one, and what I consider to be passably appropriate in a game like this. On one hand - I get the same maniacal joy of being an idiot, running people over and enjoying all of that that silly humour the same as anyone else. And I also get that this is a particular genre that is about crossing the line - while not taking itself too seriously... However, I can't help but ask myself what kind of a person is okay with grabbing a woman by the hair and face-slamming them into the pavement. It is pretty full on that you can do these special moves on the civilians - I was okay with doing it to the enemies, they're trying to kill you. There isn't much punishment either for hurting the civilians - cops come but you don't feel much of a penalty.\n\nI felt with GTA IV it was treated as a real crime, and here it's just glorified with those special moves. Should that choice even be there, and does it need to be? Do I really need to wield giant purple ♥♥♥♥♥ - why is that in the game?\n\nOne bit that took it too far was the human trafficking mission... you open a bunch of crates looking for 'hoes' to which you can then keep as your own hoes for long term income, or sell back for a quick cash reward. On the boat where they're kept, you'll find all sorts of contraptions such as 'fisting machines'... and that crossed the line.\n\nI'm so torn with this one, I almost feel hypocritical because some parts I was absolutely fine with, but other parts I just found abhorrent. I don't want be a prude, but the sexual and degrading elements of the game took it way too far and put a dampener on my experience. I mean, what's next? Violence against children? Would that be okay in a game like this, because it's not meant to be taken seriously so it just gets a free pass?\n\nAll in all it's a very good game, good graphics, good story and good missions. This is a game that should definitely be played by adults. If you can look past those few tasteless elements that just go too far, it's still worth an 9/10.","October 3, 2014","true","58.5"," 45 of 55 people (82%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","82","45","55","11","1"

I'm looking at you, GTA 4.)\n\n- You can complete the story-mode missions with your friend in co-op.\n\n- You can run over people's cars with a colour-customized tank (and the cars are only crashed on the spot you ran them over. It looks realistic.)\n\n- You can revive your teammates or your friend countless times within 25-30 seconds after their health has run out.\n\n- The missions are EPIC.\n\n- There is a wide modding community.\n\nCons:\n\n-I couldn't find any neko ears on the clothes stores, but I'm sure I can install a mod and get some.\n\n\nMy final veredict is a 9.9/10, buy this, NAOW.

No doubt about that and it's a good thing too. Saints Row The Third can no longer be called by anyone, a "GTA clone". It has it's own distinct style. A true sandbox open world, where you can have fun/cause chaos at your own pace without being dragged down by some "gritty scenario based on real life gang warfare". Nope, you can finish the entire game nude, speaking Zombie and wielding a huge ♥♥♥♥♥-shaped baseball bat if that's what you want. That freedom of absurd choices is what makes this game far better than GTA IV for example. The cars control way better than SR2 and the customization is as good as it gets in video games. Don't skip to Saints Row IV directly, even if they share the map partially. They have enough differences to make them both, worth a try.","May 18","true","2.2"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","29","32","2","0"

Leaves everybody. In a bank. Where his pals are about to complete a bank robbery. It is hilarious! Hilarious how stupid some of these characters are and the one-liners in Saints Row The 3rd almost equal to the ones in our favourite American films from the '80s or '90s.\n\nVolition made a replica of GTA IV but made a much better version of it. This is a properly optimised game that looks good and runs well on our PCs. And if you thought the script of GTA included a lot of conversations with dozens of jokes you'll immediately forget that game once you get to know the members of the Saints.\n\nThe story revolves around the Saints, an always purple-clad gang who has just taken over Steelport (the fake city where the story takes place) but is thriving to achieve more. To further extend their control over the city they must annihilate the mysterious Syndicate who commands the 3 gangs of Steelport. But then again the government does not like the too much bang-bang in the city so a special anti-gang unit is introduced and you will also have to face its leader, a ruthless general.\n\nGameplay is exactly the same as what you get used to in GTA IV. There are missions initiated by beacons once approached but the main story missions are launched by calling your buddies on your cellphone. Otherwise, you go wherever you want and do whatever you want in the city. Really. I like how the game rewards me if I hit civilians or when driving for a long time on the oncoming lane or when drifting for a long time.\n\nRemember when Niko hits a car at high speed and flies out of the windshield in GTA IV? Were you laughing hard when that happened just as I did? Well, in Saints Row you have a side mission called "insurance fraud" which means you need to let yourself hit by a car and the more hits you receive the easier it is to fly high (?) and instead of hitting the ground you need to try to hit the hood of another car and so on and so on...the multiplication and the amount of score you receive is enormous! So, you have to be prepared for doing a lot of stupid things with the Saints. This is a must and if you are not up for that you had better quit while you can!\n\nYou have collectibles, of course, for the sake of achievements and longevity: you collect cash, sex dolls and drugs. And you can steal vehicles and assassinate people. And you can level-up and spend your hard-earned cash on upgrades. And if you have DLCs you have weapons such as the shark gun that pours blood on people who are then attacked by a shark (yes, the appear from below the asphalt). Stupid fun! You can also have a lot of properties in the city just so you can actually feel like being someone controlling a huge area!\n\nThe game is very funny. The cars are fast and fully upgradeable. You can apply upgrades you have never thought of, by the way. Turning on the radio while driving is just as fun as in GTA. You have a dozen tracks available so everyone can find his or her taste. Voice acting is equally good and did I mention Burt Reynolds is the mayor of the city? And that there is a side mission where you drive while a tiger is sitting next to you in the car bothering you?\n\nThe story is mediocre at best but really funny. Saints Row is a must and it is one of my all time favourite games!","August 21, 2014","true","50.9"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","34","41","6","0"

It's a game that doesn't really take itself too seriously which is either a good or bad thing for some and the graphics are cartoonish to go along with the humor of the game which might fall flat for some people at times.\n\nIn Steelport you'll be spending your time either completing the missions, doing activities and finding the collectables, or going around the city causing mayhem. The story itself is based around getting revenge for someone and thats about it, lasting roughly 10+ hours. To make it even worse; Saints Row 4 basically renders every action you did during this game entirely pointless. However the missions themselves are pretty enjoyable, and the interactions between the characters are interesting despite not being too fleshed out.\n\nWhile the story isn't too particularily compelling and the game's humor and graphics may not appeal to everyone, Saints Row: The Third is solid overall and pretty fun to play by yourself or with a friend. It occassionally goes on sale for $3.74 and it's definitely worth purchasing for that amount.\n\nPros:► Fun single player and co-op gameplay experience\n► Lots of customization options for your character, gang members and cars\n► Variety of missions\n► Interesting characters\n► Many Activities to do and secrets to find\n► Upgrade system (guns, character, homies)\n► The timing for the songs / tracks bring out the feeling of a scene, especially the final mission\n► Solid controls\n\nCons:► Linear progression in the plot, where as the first two games would let you choose the order you could take out the gangs\n► Story isn't particularily interesting or compelling\n► Acheivement hunters won't be able to 100% due to the character gallary being down\n► No cutscene replay option as with the first two games\n► The city itself is particularily dull and lifeless\n► Stuck with any upgrades choices you make, can't switch them on or off\n\nHit / Miss:► Humor is a hit or miss for some people\n► Few one time only choices that affect bonuses you'll recieve, but otherwise won't affect the storyline\n► Upgrading too much may ruin your experience if you want a challenge\n\nPersonal Rating:Avoid at all costs\nPick up during a sale\nWorth Playing\nMust Play","June 22, 2015","true","57.5"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","25","28","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andyone/recommended/55230/","andyone","ANDY 1 HARDCORE  [UK]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andyone/","290 products in account","The highly anticipated review for me, because The Saints are special to me, unique as a part. Game, which was theoretically last chance, and last hope for THQ, was the biggest money injection they got, and they still wasn't able to stock up money, to cover up the bancrupt. THQ was with us since 1989, and it's hard to believe, that they're just gone ... Their message was sent through their games. Lots of their projects has been sold to those, who aren't capable of putting it to top level (I won't mention no one, because I always respected work of developers).\n\nSaints Row: The Third as a game, and THQ as a dev has bonus points from me, because they were in need of money, but they still wanted to be themselves, and didn't caught up with standard game bussiness model (using same old tactics, to be successful on the market). SR3 is attacking sandbox genre with its uniqueness, and it's conquering with Grand Theft Auto series way more smart. GTA always trying to be realistic with a bit of "american dream" .. SR3 doing opposite - total rampage, total crazyness, total unrealistic b-sh*t, octopuses on our heads, dancing pandas, fetish pedestrians, Safeword crib, big dild*s, automated ♥♥♥♥♥♥ penetratiors.\n\nGame is tribute to money, drugs, sex, fetish, and dolls, and that's why I love it.\n\nStory is about rise, about motivation and work to be, what you want to be. The Saints came to Steelport with 0 on bank account, without weapons, without connexions, but with DETERMINATION to conquere whole Steelport and they did it. (Of course I'm not taking it serious) Cutscenes are done pretty well, dialougues are well-written, brilliant, and epic funny. Characters was picked up correctly, almost every one from The Saints are unforgetable - Zimos, Shaundi, Pierce, Oleg, Kinzie and Angel of course.\n\nStory-line is written like you finally think it's over, but it's not even in halfway. Like 3 times I thought it's over, but it wasn't, and I was glad, that story of killing anyone who came to our way continues. Behind story missions there are plenty of "activities" and activities to be done. Like 36 assasinations, 30 car hijacks, 41 challenges, and around 40 activities to be needed done, for taking over Steelport. Buying shops, and drug labs :X Upgrading mansions and cribs improving your control of the streets, money income and respect. You can tune up almost every car in-game, or find armored street-cleaner car and run over Zombies. Steal a jet, and ♥♥♥ up day of police officers, or just grab a tank, and roll through the streets, and running over cars. In CO-OP even better.\n\nSoundtrack is great, playlist on the radios are solid .. Most significant is track POWER from Kanye West from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy album. This track in original describes power of Kanye, but it's almost accurate, to describe power of The Saints.\n\nIn the whole game, there's only 1 thing I actually don't like, and it is level-design. Artificially increased effort, of making game harder, just ain't worked, it was still so easy, but it just look stupid. I will name some situations .. For example, you had to steal military boat. It was just chilling on the water, behind the military camp. When you sneaked from back-side, and tried to stole the boat, it was just still marked on the map, but you couldn't deliver it, because you had to enter the military base, to earn 4 wanted stars, and then you was able to deliver it... Really stupid, and this happening almost every-time in the game, but it doesn't matter, because this game is just creepy and freaking awesome.\n\n9,5/10\n..............................................................................................\nQuality of  games ain't killed THQ ... Software piracy did.\nThanks for awesome 23 years with you ..

The story however may feel disjointed and lack context at times, plus, some will find their rewards less special because they get so many so quickly.  That isn't always bad however, because some of us just want to start going nuts as quick as possible, taking to the streets with a friend and delivering an underhanded rocket launcher swing to the groin of a man wearing a mascot costume.  This game is not for the easily offended or those who like a slow boil, but it welcomes those like myself who was bored by GTA4's lack of sandbox wonder.","February 22, 2012","true","47.9"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","17","17","3","2"

Think over-the-top hollywood action sequences, except even crazier and stupider. For example, in the second "mission" of the game (which is literally right after the intro mission and character creation), you'll be jumping out of a plane, shooting other people who jumped out of said plane, shooting an absurd amount of cars that fell out of said plane as they fall, catch someone in midair, then shoot the cockpit window of another plane that is trying to ram you, fall all the way through that plane and out the other side to start the whole thing over again.\n\nIt only gets crazier and stupider from there, but that's part of what makes the game so fun. Saint's Row the Third is all about doing stupid, crazy, wacky things, and it knows it. It's not just stupidity and wackiness, though. While the game makes fun of a great many practices used by businesses in general these days, overused tropes, and even itself (even hanging a few lampshades here and there), the main story is surprisingly involved (though still crazy and stupid as a whole) and one of the potential endings is actually rather serious (as are a few of the messages hidden in the crazy).\n\nWhile certain other games (*cough* GTA *cough*) are trying to go more for "realism" and constantly saying "You can't do that", or "You have to do this", Saint's Row the Third shrugs and says "Yeah, sure, you can do that. Why not?" (And Saint's Row IV takes it to the extreme). It's also perfectly willing to say "You don't have to do this". Most of the game is not in the main quest, but in the minigames all around the city, and you don't even have to get very far in the main story to be able to do most of them. In addition, while you have to make a choice at the end of the main quest, you are not locked into that choice, and in fact can play the other choice immediately after completing the one you picked.\n\nWhile there's not really much replayability (other than starting a new game and/or playing with friends), the game technically doesn't end, and you can continue running around the city doing whatever stupid stuff you want (and if you've been upgrading your character enough, you can even jump from the height limit to the ground without taking damage, and eat bullets for breakfast), or finishing up whatever minigames you didn't complete while doing the main story. The gameplay, while not perfect (and glitchy at times, particularly in multiplayer), is fairly solid. Graphics are perfectly fine.  Sounds are good. Oh, and there's no "cover system". You take cover by, *gasp* hiding or crouching behind cover, and enemies will move around to get a better angle on you (though the AI is still rather stupid and tends to only win by spamming moar dudes at you). Cars will also explode (because it's all about the crazy stupid) after taking enough bullets, so don't hide behind them for too long. You can also grab enemies and use them as human shields, either executing them when you don't need them anymore, or throwing them at their allies. Another nice feature is the ability to keep any vehicle (barring certain mission specific ones) you steal. Not just one or a few at a time like GTA. All of them. Just take it to one of your garages, or soup it up in a Rim Jobs, and it will be available to you from any Rim Jobs or garage for the rest of the game. It's that easy. You can even have one of your "homies" deliver a vehicle you own to you!\n\nThere's plenty more fun, crazy, stupid stuff you can do in this game, but you'll have to look at other reviews for those (or even the descriptions for certain DLC (*cough* mind control explosive octopus cannon *cough*). All in all, I consider SRTT a good break from all of the standard tried and true formulas that are just rehashed over and over. A fun game that doesn't take itself seriously, and doesn't expect you to take it seriously either. Worth every penny, IMO.","May 7, 2015","true","205.8"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","20","23","6","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/55230/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2360 products in account","The third time is more of a tease than a charm. Saints was going through that awkward stage of growing up and trying to find itself with this entry. Prior releases were closer to cheesy Grand Theft Auto clones with a little bit of wacky stuff thrown in (hitman missions found you murdering people in hotdog suits so that you could unlock a platinum weapon). The Third really tried to position itself as over top and zany, but it does not quite hit the mark.\n\nEverything about the game, from mechanics on up, is fine. The guns shoot, the cars drive, and so on. But nothing quite ever gets over the top. The weapons are all a generic bunch (some shotguns, pistols, and so on) with the craziest set of weapons relying on a cool down rather than ammo. Yes there is a shark gun (which acts like an instant kill with a slow cool down, so you might as well use your shotgun) which is rather tame, or the mollusk launcher that actually stands out. Even at their most upgraded most of the guns felt the same and I couldn't be bothered to decide between generic rifle 1 or 2 because they both did an ok job at killing enemies, which are another problem.\n\nEnemies, whether they are dressed like luchadores or cyber punk fans, are all pretty much the same. The most elite members will differ in their special weapons (a grenade launcher or a shock hammer respectively for example), but they both die quickly from bullets, like everyone else in the game. There is no need to switch up using your favorite gun to fight one gang or type of enemy from another. If I recall correctly, the brute enemy type is the one exception to this. The sameness of enemies is a pretty large problem because nearly every mission is you shooting waves of enemies, going to another area, and shooting some more while bits of dialogue drabble on. Simplicity is fine, not all games need variety, but if a game only has one trick it needs to pull that on trick off well. It becomes apparent pretty quick that the enemies and the weapons are, for the most part, just coats of paint. The other biggest part of missions and the game, is the "getting there" part.\n\nIn a game with a hovercraft, you should not always be choosing the hovercraft just because it is the most convenient option. This is a problem for most open world games though: traveling around is not always fun. Grand Theft Auto San Andreas figured this out pretty quick with the "trip skip" feature that allowed you to retry missions fairly quickly. However, The Third has you selecting a mission, hoping that it doesn't force you to go across the map, and then saddling up for a drive weaving through traffic so that you can start a mission that will have you drive around more. Saints Row: The Third really likes to push this idea that it's all about wacky fun, but traveling just doesn't fit that paradigm. Wanting to get to missions faster isn't only an issue of vehicles being too slow, it is also an issue of the world being too boring.\n\nThe world of Steelport is awfully flat. Most of the areas look the same (especially once you have cleared gangs out from them) and there isn't a whole lot to do: there are some shops, activities, or you can make a ruckus on your own. Activities are a mixed bag with some repeats from the older entries, so some are fun and others are lacking. The citizens wandering around mindlessly make the city feel lifeless. As dry as Grand Theft Auto IV’s setting was, the radio hosts, pedestrians, and minor missions all gave character to Liberty City. So "causing mayhem," which is what having an open world game allows you to do, consists of you slaughtering people who aren't doing all that much anyway.\n\nThe "awesome" button is pretty disappointing. Holding it down turns your moderate jog into a decent sprint, makes you smash through a car window rather than open a door, and changes your regular punches into an elaborate canned animation. But, SR3 is supposed to be the kind of game that always has the awesome button turned on, and indeed I used it as much as possible (mostly for sprinting). Throughout the whole game I couldn't help but feel like actions using the awesome button should have just been standard, like my awesome sprint should have just been my base speed. This button kind of represents the game in a larger sense: everything is relative, and the inclusion of an “awesome” button seems more like them lowering the standard of basic actions to make the awesome button rather than actually unleash all the wackiness that should be there. The awesome button should have me kicking ribcages straight out of bodies, performing human hammer throws that clear out sidewalks, shooting like I am in a John Woo film, etc. Much like the hovercraft, I only used the “awesome” button because it was convenient, not fun. Ultimately Grand Theft Auto San Andreas feels more over the top than SR3 because it all feels fairly grounded until you go on a rampage with a military grade helicopter. The overall message of zany, unbelievable action that SR3 tries to push falls flat because it sets expectations to high. San Andreas has far less explosions than SR3, so when I actually got a hold of some remote controlled explosives I would go around strapping them to police cars and enjoy my short lived rampage. But in SR3 my money generates itself pretty quickly so explosions are fairly standard. The same goes for unlocking my ability of extra health or fire resistance in either game: I had to work to unlock them in San Andreas whereas SR3 just had me buy them with money that made itself. The hovercraft in SR3 should be way cooler than the army helicopter in San Andreas, but it isn't because I expect more from Saints Row The Third.\n\nI recommend Saints Row: The Third because it is fun for a while, and there isn't quite an open world like it (though Just Cause comes close and surpasses it in some ways). Yeah the weapons and enemies are all bland, and most of the mission structures are vanilla, but I would be lying if I said there weren't any parts of the game that delivered on being fun. A particular Decker's mission sticks out, as do the first few opening missions. It's a shame that the game couldn't keep the pacing of these highlight moments, though it still manages to be fun.","December 18, 2015","true","41.9"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","81","22","27","7","0"

It reminds me of a mixture of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas meets Rambo, with all the shooting, guns, explosions, and the body count you leave in your wake. I've heard negative things about the game over the years, which is why I avoided trying it, and now I regret that decision. Saints Row: The Third is non-stop action. From the opening scenes where you are committing a robbery gone haywire, to jumping out of a plane without a parachute and performing stunts that rival those seen from hollywood, this game is a lot of fun. Basically, you start off after choosing or creating your own character, as the leader of the Saints, a once prestigous gang, who now has no money, and no respect. Slowly you must work to turn around your fortunes and build a criminal empire.\n\nWhile I did enjoy Saints Row: The Third, even on hardcore the game seemed a little to easy. Visually, it doesn't look bad for a game thats been out a few years now. The action scenes, were pretty good, immersive, and fun to both watch and play through.

So, as a quick TLDR Buy it, if you have more than enough money buy it and buy one for a friend, if you have enough money buy it, if you don't have enough money wait for it to go on sale, it always does.\n\nNow for why you need to buy it right now.\nPre-Note: Saints row 4 is out so I don't get why you aren't looking at that but hey, whatever this game is just as good but less... super-hero-ey\n\nReason #1 : The game is Open world\n\nReason #2 : The game is like GTA where you can shoot some people have some fun, do whatever you want.\n\nReason #3 : The game has a very good Character Creation system so you can play as you want. Want to be a prom queen in high heels killing swat? sure. Wanna be a morbidly obese man in a thong and high heels? sure. Want to be high heels? Not possible, but you can be a toilet and some other... models...\n\nReason #4 : The game not taken seriously. if you want to play it serious the story is kind of.... off of real life standards but honestly its comedy gold. why would you play a realistic game?\n\nReason #5 : Its drop in, drop out Multiplayer. (with friendly fire allowed to be enabled/disabled) ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at a friend? Blast them in the head with a shotgun, and then they'll probably get mad and challenge you to a mini game called cat and mouse where you both go into a world where one person gets a helicopter with rockets and the other one has to dodge them all, then they get their turn after about 2 minutes (unless Player 1 kills Player 2).\n\nReason #5.5 : That last one got a bit off, but not only are there fun games to play with each other its co-op too, which means someone else can roam the world (no distance restrictions) and help you with your story, or side missions, or ♥♥♥♥ing off.\n\nReason #6 : The game runs... Well. Honestly I'm going to have to give this part a maybe, you should meet the "recommended" standards or else you will lag, which takes away from the fun a bit. Saints Row 4 runs better than SR3, don't ask me why but I assume that its better optimized.\n\nReason #7 : uhhhh... because I said hat its really great?\n\nReason #8 : OH YEAH! the soundtrack is great (car radio stations iPad thing etc.). Plus on the topic of cars you can customize your own, and not really have to worry about damaging it, buying a new one just charges you 500$ (in game money) which to be honest, in a world where you can seal any car that's just a small price.\n\nReason #9 : Look I'm just trying to come up with reasons now so feel free to stop reading at any time. Reason 9 is that you don't have to just play with your friends you can join another person in up to 4 player online Co-Op/Vs/Whatever.\n\nReason #10 : It's a big world?\n\nReason #11 : Because I said so. Again. Just buy it.\n\nStory: 8/10 (barely paid attention to main story, however when I did it was... entertaining)\nGameplay: 10/10 (3rd person shooting etc.)\nPresentation: 10/10\nSoundtrack: 11/10 (CRANK IT TO 11! Also this music is always fantastic. It'll even take you back to places you never knew existed.)\nReplayability: 8/10 (Plenty of side stories and missions, and plenty to do with friends.

Ask a friend to join you and cause havoc together, while dressed up as anything between Steampunk heroes to furries in animal suits to straight up thugs - Your street gang, your rules.","January 29, 2015","true","158.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","13","15","7","0"

That seems like bad timing on your part." Well, shadup! this was the next one on the list, you're not the boss of me. *cries*\n-Quick Review-\nSaints Row: The Third, switches between "Total comedy" and "serious dramatic moment" like an OCD kid with a light switch stuck in the middle position. If you like third person shooters... you'll probably like this game. If you like extra aesthetics... (hats, clothes, motorcycles, cars, customization, and more!) you'll probably like this game. If you like nerdy humor, you'll definitely like this game.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Welcome back to Stilwater, Boss. Since the last Saints Row Game, the gang has gone from a street gang to a household brand name. However, due to a gang uprising, the saints will need to take it all back.\n\nGame Play: What can be said for a game that lets you do most things you can imagine... It's hilarious and fun. You can walk down the street and punch out random people, I ran around the docks and threw people into the water, with a friend. We had many hours of good wholesome laughter.\nThe game is a third person shooter, there are a number of different weapons you can use and unlock, there are even more you can get if you buy DLC. There are many costume that you can use to change your characters appearance... can't find a look you like? You can go running through the streets naked. (<<hilariously pleasant discovery for me)\n\nAchievements: At the time that I'm writing this review, I've 25 hours of the game, and earned 53% of the achievements. Most of the achievements are earned and can be viewed in game as "accomplishments", there are a few that are steam exclusive achievements. There is at least one broken achievement, the one that requires you to upload a character to the saintsrow website. (last attempt 03/07/15) I was able to successful log into my saints row account and upload a character on 09/27/15.\n\nPrice:  Saints Row: The Third is priced at $14.99 for the standalone game, You'll probably prefer to get all the extra DLC with the $19.99 deal, or getting the Franchise pack. I personally waited until the game was on sale before purchasing, but the amount paid is very easily justified with how much time can be spent in the game.\n\nConclusion: I'm sure it's the story for most people who have played the Saints Row games; I came into the franchise skeptical on if I was actually going to find the game as fun and amusing as everyone was saying. It definitely was, and more. I am officially looking forward to seeing where this series will go.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update April 17, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for Saints Row IV\n\nEdit/Update September 27, 2015:\nBroken achievement fixed.","April 17, 2015","true","69.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Blowing up cars while driving, shooting people with rockets with no clothes on you, taking over a city in the gang banging way while the army hunts you down, this game is quite an experience. The characters are kind of stereotypical, but that only adds to the fun. The character customization is the richest one you'll ever see in a game; you can set your gender, race, build, facial features, body features, age, personality and more. While it may seem too ridiculous to pulverize people by hitting them with a giant purple ♥♥♥♥♥, after a while it will get to you and you'll enjoy those kind of things. The bad part is that it takes a while to get into it, since you can't enjoy the full madness from the beginning  and the story also gets more interesting later(like when the bridge gets fired down by a thousand rockets).

Saints Row the Third can be accused of being many things, but repetitive isn't one of them.\n\nSome games create atmospheric worlds that attempt to draw you in with moving stories about characters seeking a second chance, or cast you as troubled superheroes who push themselves to the limit to fight evil. Saints Row: The Third is not like those games. Rather, it's the kind of game that gives you weapons called apocafists with which you can punch people, instantly making them explode in a bloody mess. The Third won't impress you with knockout visuals, move you with an absorbing story, or engage you with challenging combat. What it does, better than just about any game before, is embrace the idea of an open world as a place for play, constantly giving you access to awesome new toys and providing you with no shortage of exciting opportunities to use them.\n\nOne thing you definitely shouldn't ignore is the main story. Within just the first few missions, you plummet out of a plane and into an airborne shoot-out, skydive into a penthouse that belongs to a rival gang, use a UAV drone to call in guided missiles on tanks, and more. The missions eventually become a bit predictable for a while, serving as introductions to the other activities and diversions available to you in Steelport. But before long, they get wild again, packing in numerous surprises before culminating in one of two outrageous final missions.\n\nSaints Row: The Third is buoyed to great heights by terrific mission design and by the remarkable assortment of vehicles and weapons it gives you with which to take over Steelport. Whether you're buying up property to increase your hourly income, cruising the city in your favorite vehicle to collect photo ops, drug packages, and sex dolls, or punching people to bits with those crazy apocafists, there's rarely a dull moment. Saints Row: The Third succeeds tremendously at delivering its unique brand of raunchy, outrageous fun. If you have an appetite for this particular kind of absurdity, you won't be disappointed\n\n10/10","October 17, 2015","true","35.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Having just finished Saints Row 2 and immediately diving right into Saints Row The Third I have to say that this game is an absolutely fantastic continuation of the series. Without getting into the story, which is quite good by the way, you are quickly thrust into some of the most over-the-top action movie like sequences from the first minute of the game which hopefully sets the pace for the rest of the title. Fans of the series will find many things familiar while also having some new elements to deal with as well. I'm proud to say that the gameplay, some factors of which I had a problem with in the previous title, has been greatly refined as the driving, fighting and shooting are intuitive and silky smooth. Graphically this game is one of the most beautiful open world titles out there...I've yet to complete but a handful of the earliest missions in the game because I'm spending most of my time just exploring this wonderfully crafted open-world environment.

There's really no where else to go but down from here regardless of which game I play next in the series.\n\nIt's got just about everything you could ask for, great selection of clothing and customization, good variety of weapons, both useful and novelty. It's easy to navigate around the map and the GPS is very well detailed. The map size is also just the right amount of large... it never really seemed overwhelming to me even from the start. Games like GTA and Crackdown just annoyed me with all of their collectables and cluster, this game does it right.\n\nThere's plenty of side quests and optional missions to partake in so you'll deinitely be getting your money out of it. The humor is just the right amount of juvenile... you can avoid it completely if you wish to do so. It's over the top and meant to be a parody of sandbox gangster genre games and it definitely delivers. The DLC also adds a lot to the game but can get lost in the mix if you've never played the core game first... I might be basing some of this review on that, so make sure to pick up a complete pack on sale.\n\nThe finale is also hilarious with a well known 80's pop song playing while you finish the final mission... One of the more satisfying game endings I've seen.","October 8, 2014","true","73.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","13","17","3","0"

It may not purposely have a more serious storyline, yet it leans more towards a rather melodramatic badassery. The game itself in terms of features, is rich. You'll have a huge variety of customization opportunities to form your character to just the way you imagined it.\nThis applies to the fact that you will also provide your character a personality, with choice of voice, the way they compliment and/or taunt, etc.\n\nThe controls are kind on you, incredibly beginner-friendly with some room for mastering. The aiming is great but quickly becomes irrelevant as you can upgrade your firearms to carry explosive bullets for instance, which has a fatal spread, hence the lack of necessity of aiming, unless you're all about sniper rifles.\n\nThe vehicle customization is beyond nonsensical, but in a pleasing way. You can customize almost any vehicle, I have yet come across a vehicle that cannot be customized, but having that said, I have yet ridden all vehicles into the tuning garage either.\n\nPersonally I'd certainly recommend this game for anyone that are looking for an absurdly inappropiate playground, to indulge your absolute bizarre fantasies, under any catergory, you can just about make whatever you please out of the game.

I play games for 25 years now and due to my collection habit i have consoles going back to the late 70's and i played a ton of games but for the past 10 years there was rarely a game that had characters that stuck to my mind and became favourites of mine like Sonic, Duke Nukem, Alex Kidd or Super Mario did before. Saints Row started out as a pretty mediocre GTA version but over time it developed it's own identity and went away from competing with GTA and instead went into the comedy department, something that been missing over the last 1 or 2 decades in gaming. Everything today tries to be as realistic as possible, simulating every aspect of real life while the fun of gaming relies in doing absurd, unrealistic things.\n\nIn some ways when i had to compare games to music, GTA is like the 90's with the dreaded grunge and alternative style: a lot of melodramatic moments, humour is of the black genre and often a bit too serious and realistic for the humour to work (the torture scene in GTA V was a moment the developers clearly wanted as satire but they missed their mark and it came across as too realistic and juvenile.\nSaints Row the Third is Glam/Sleaze Metal of the 80's: Don't take it serious but join the fun. It's Party all night long on a Livewire Nightrain into a Fantasy World of comic characters. You lead a rock star gangster group that robs a bank...and fails which is the introduction of you going trough an airplane full of gangsters only to parachute down...\nand that's only the beginning of a rollercoaster ride that involes a belgium guy, clones, mexican wrestlers who will deliver a montreal screw job on you and a lot of crazy moments.\n\nThe missions are diverse, you have the standard "drive there, shoot this" missions only to next roll in a big yarn ball around town to jump ino an airplane and do your best Top Gun impression while saving a pimp....by using him lilke a horse. The whole game is beyond insane and that is awesome.\n\nCouple that with a great soundtrack that has various radio stations with adverts and disaster news by jane valderama and of course you can create your very own mixtape by taking songs from all stations and combine them. Importing songs is sadly forbidden but the mixture of classical music, 80's and 90's pop, rock and metal as well as hip hop, electronic should satisfy everybody and while i'm as far removed from being a fan of rap and hip hop music i have to say that jumping from a helicopter onto an apartment on top of a skyscraper only to shoot a ton of people while "Power" from kanye west is playing is awesome.\n\nAll the NPCs are also fun, they have great voice actors and Pierce Washington singing "What i got" from Sublime with your Player Character who is fully customizable and can be either male or female with various different voices for each gender, is hilarious all the time. The reaming characters are also awesome, you have Rob Van Dam as color commentator on a wacky show, you have Hulk Hogan as a mexican wrestler and Burt Reynolds as Mayor or Stillwater. It's top notch.\n\nAnd going back to GTA: Unlike Rockstars game, the Plane and Helicopter controls actually work and it's fun to fly around imitating Top Gun and of course it wouldn't be Saints Row if there weren't a lot of wacky Cars and Air vehicles (Salem!)\n\nI can't say anything negative about this game, i played it a lot, finished it three times, played it Co-op with friends who enjoyed it a lot too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atlastherobot/recommended/55230/","atlastherobot","Atlas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atlastherobot/","381 products in account","So I was always sceptical to play the saints row franchise, so very enamoured and snooty with pretty much everything Rockstar has done with GTA. I thought to myself, 'A ridiculous, tongue-in-cheek slapstick take on sandbox criminal gaming? Pshaw, not for me, good sir.’ And then I would doff my invisible top hat and saunter out of the room like a royal prick.\n\nAnyway I’ve played through Saints Row 2 and 3 now and god damn I couldn’t have been more wrong. I made the mistake of assuming that slapstick and ridiculous were synonymous with lazy and cheap. On the contrary, what I’ve been playing is a very polished product, with a dedication to freshness and humour. Not the kind of humour Rockstar is throttling, but instead something that is unashamed to be silly, but in a super sleek, sexy kind of way. It owns it, and just because it dares to be silly doesn’t mean that it doesn’t care to do it classily.\n\nI recommend SR2 for the remarkable grit in its story, and 3 for how smooth and polished (and funny) it is. Give it a shot. Then track down your friend and play it again co-op. Then teach your pet to use a mouse and keyboard and play it again, only this time videoing the pet and uploading it to youtube. ♥♥♥♥ would sell.","March 18, 2014","true","38.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

This doesn't apply to cars, which are dull and generic, but holy crap, the other stuff. You want to hijack a jet and bomb the city? Go. Do some rampage with a pixelated tank? Go, go, go. Drive an armed helicopter? Sure. And all those crazy vehicles.\n+ Customization. You can literally do everything with your character. Build her/him up from the ground. Buy the craziest clothes or well...you can just run around butt naked. Upgrade the gang or tune your car. The variety is wide here, but in character customization is almost limitless.\n+ Mini-games, mini-games everywhere! There are some activities that you won't see anywhere else. Ride along with a tiger, do some drug trafficking, jump under cars to earn money with your insurance, racing with the unimaginable vehicles (yes, Tron mini-game, we are talking about you), destroy cars and citizens while driving a quad set on fire (!!!) or just blow up the city as such. Whoa, even typing those makes us excited.\n+ The co-op campaign is a great addition to the game. Yes, it's not very polished, and there are missions where the second player feels like a third wheel, but even then, playing with a buddy is always fun.\n+ The game isn't the most beautiful, but still holds up and the characters designs support the crazy game design very well.\n\n~ Steelport is great, but it's very under utilized. By the time we've finished the campaign we didn't know the locations of the most important places. Simply the game doesn't teach you the city. There's always the GPS, so don't even look at the road while driving.\n~ The characters in the game fit into the Saints world. They would be ridiculous and bad in any other game, but this is different. Luckily the more annoying characters get fewer "screen time".\n~ Open world sand box games tend to have long single player modes. Not Saints Row the Third. The campaign can be finished in about 10-12 hours. It could be a negative point, but the activities and other mini-games will keep you in the game for a good number of hours.\n\n- The story starts off interestingly, but soon falls becomes generic with frustrating and pointless missions that doesn't add anything to the experience (expect the progress in the story, of course).\n- The AI is really atrocious. Your companions get stuck often and the enemies just stand there to get shot without any resistance. Strategy is non-existent, when they see you, they try shoot and kill you, mostly without success. And if we are at enemies...\n- ... they're bulletsponges. A simple footsoldier takes a clip from your handgun before he dies. You can help this with upgrading your weapons, but event then, the enemies will get stronger as you progress. On a side note, your character also takes a dozen clip to die. Jumping into a room and executing a massacre just stops being fun after a couple of hours.\n- The new city is big and open but you can never say that it's living. You get the feeling that there are random stuff happening all the time but without rules or consequences. Steelport definitely isn't a city where you just want to wander around and spend time. Simply there's too much silliness happening around you to feel "home".\n\nTime to beat: 11 hours.\nIn one word: Crazy\nOn P'n'C scale: Fun Time\nMust give points: 80","April 6, 2014","true","14.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

Thanks for the censor Steam.)\n\nLike Grand Theft Auto you start out as a small time thug trying to work your way up in organized crime.  Wait, that's not right, you're a ♥♥♥♥in' baller! You're head of the world’s greatest street gang/media conglomerate/♥♥♥ tasting energy maker.  That is, until another gang knocks you down to nothing and like Grand Theft Auto you start out as a small time thug trying to work your way up in organized crime.\n\nRather than try to out grit the GTA franchise, Saint's Row goes for humor.  It is a ridiculous satire of other video games, corporate culture, politics and pop culture.  If high brow or subtle humor isn't your thing, there are plenty of ♥♥♥♥ and fart jokes, too.  The dialog and cuts scenes are hilarious, and change slightly depending on which voice you pick for your character.  I’ve played the game up to the “What I got” sing along four times just to hear what the different characters say.\n\nWhile the game doesn’t take the story or characters seriously, it does take the game play seriously.  The controls are responsive and intuitive.  It’s also one of the few games I’ve played that let you switch between gamepad and keyboard and mouse on the fly without problems.  The challenges and mini games are fun and there is enough variety to keep it from becoming monotonous.  The top level perks are game breaking, but it’s not like you’re forced to buy them (as if you could pass up 0% damage from bullets.)  My favorite part is the unarmed power attacks, each one is some form of nut shot or ♥♥♥♥ punch.\n\nIn conclusion, I can’t say it’s the best (or funniest) game ever, but nothing else comes to mind.","January 4, 2014","true","87.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

Saints Row 2 was significantly less graphically advanced than GTA IV, but between the new engine of The Third and the slightly cartoon-y art stylization that's no longer an issue. It doesn't have quite as many character customization options as 2, and Steelport is less geographically diverse than Stillwater.\n\nBut the PC version of SR3 runs flawlessly (it's not a janky port like 2 for PC) and features drop-in co-operative play throughout the entire game,which every "sandbox" game should have but few do. The story and missions owe a lot to Shoot 'Em Up/Crank-type cinema, aka THE BEST CINEMA. Truly proof that games ARE art; why in the Horde/♥♥♥♥♥d Mode you prove it! But the best thing Saints Row The Third has over GTA4 is that it doesn't have THE ABSOLUTE ALL-TIME WORST CAR HANDLING PHYSICS IN GAMING HISTORY like GTA 4.","December 27, 2011","true","64.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It aims to be a gloriously over the top thrill ride and it succeeds with great aplomb. From start to finish it’s all-out mayhem. Nowhere else do you get the opportunity to batter someone with a huge adult toy or drive around town with an angry tiger in the passenger seat. Few games have actually made me laugh out loud but SRTT did. There are some truly hilarious moments and plenty of dry dialogue. The one-liners are delivered with perfection by the voice actors (I chose the English voice for the playable character – voiced by Robin Atkin Downes, I believe – and it fitted seamlessly). There have been criticisms that story missions feel more like side missions and I can understand this concern. But story is not really what this game is about. There has to be a narrative of sorts but it’s the freewheeling craziness of the gameplay that makes this game a joy. Graphically the game is pretty good without being notable. Steelport is nicely realised but some of the character models are less impressive. The soundtrack is worth a note as it includes some fantastic music from just about every genre imaginable. It may not be to everyone’s taste but if you fancy 15+ hours of riotous pandemonium (plus however many hours of coop, although I suspect it might get old quite quickly once you’ve finished the campaign and experienced all the hilarity and craziness) then you can’t go far wrong with this game. 4/5","August 11, 2014","true","19.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I didn't get it.\nOR maybe I did, I began to realise...\nSure they decided to cut one of the main characters, and in such an anticlimactic way (you don't even see what happens, just a taunting "what we did to your friend" warning) that I just didn't believe it for a while.\nSure they created a cartoon instead of an action/comedy hustle movie, but after a while I stopped resisting and let the writers take me on that ride.\n\nAND WHAT A RIDE IT WAS!  The singalong with Pierce is much better than the one in SR2, this time you get to see the emotional turmoil of your enemies, rather than your own crew being the only ones with feelings. And the laughs just keep on coming, both sight gags and well written jokes in the script. Time your drinking carefully or you'll shoot milk from your nose, whatever you're drinking. They still find time to wedge in a little bit of satire about politics. and btw, FINALLY a mayor I can get along with after certain crooked councilmen and their interfering wives...\n\nHow ridiculous is this game? In one of the opening missions your character abandons their parachute, shoots their way into a jumbo jet through the window, freefalls through it, shooting a dozen people on the way, and grabbing another 'chute on the way out.\nThat isn't even in the top 5 outrageous moments in this game!\nIt's a little easier than SR2, but that just lets you get through the story quicker, you never have any moment thta feels like you're grinding.\n\nDLC\nThere's a pretty big load of it to be had, some of which I never used as they would have made it too easy to beat the early stages, and I unlocked equivalents in time for the later ones. I'd suggest taking them and choosing carefully to find the right boosts for your playstyle. The DLC weapons seem a little OP at first, until you upgrade the ones in the main game.","November 29, 2013","true","63.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The enemies you fight throughout the game consist of the same 4 NPC models for each gang. They've created an excuse for themselves by claiming that they're all a product of cloning.\n\nOptimization:\n\nThis game is optimized for AMD video cards. If you're using a Nvida card you're going to be experiencing significantly lower frame rate and random frame drops.\n\nCurrency system:\n\nMoney in Saints Row The Third practically flows like water. You recieve money for killing enemies, completing missions, completing challenges, barnstorming and through a multitude of glitches to reach to the money limit of $20,000,000. There's one barn storming location in particular that gives you $12,333 if you fly through it sideways.\n\nThe Notority System:\n\nThere's no arrest system, no sneak system, you cannot bribe the police or outrun your nortirety. No matter what you do whether it be as small as punching a civilian or as extreme as slaughtering hundreds of innocent people, the police will attempt to kill you. The ONLY way to lose your notority is to walk into a store or safehouse owned by the Saints or attempt to wait until your notority fades. However, you're likely to commit even more crimes when you're running for your life from machine guns, snipers, attack choppers and tanks.\n\nVehicle Thefts:\n\nWithin the Saints Book there's 34 vehicle thefts needed to be completed to get the 100%. Volition made it to where you get a higher notority level as you progress in the vehicle thefts, just to frustrate the player I assume. Unfortunately, there is no way of outrunning the norority so this side activity is practically getting to the checkpoint before the vehicle explodes. While driving, enemies will constantly spawn within feet ahead of you, almost guranteeing a crash. I will provide a demonstrition video at the bottom of this review.\n\nAssassination Missions:\n\nThere's 36 assassination missions needed to be completed for the 100%. These are fairly easy usually consisting of doing a particular thing to lure out the target. However, some require for you to gain gang nortority in certain areas of the map and if you've already taken over that part of the map, you're going to need to complete it on an earlier save or in a friend's game. Towards the end of the assassination missions  Burt Renolds will ask you to kill a particular person. This person is the Concerned Citizen you've been doing assassinations for up until that point, DO NOT KILL HIM UNTIL YOU'VE COMPLETED ALL OF HIS ASSASSINATION MISSIONS FOR THE CONCERNED CITIZEN. Killing him before will make the 100% unobtainable. Sadly, nobody warned me ahead of time.\n\nCharacter Customization:\n\nCharacter customization is one of the few things that other games need to take a page from when it comes to Saints Row The Third. Though lacking a skin tone slider, the game allows you to select from a variety of skin tones and options. Unfortunately, there's always an insanely repetitive tune playing in all of the Image as Designed stores while customizing your character.\n\nVehicle Customization:\n\nUnlike the Saints Row franchise's previous title Saints Row 2, you can no longer listen to the song playing on the radio while editing your vehicle, you must listen to the same repetitive tune. You also no longer get a view of what your vehicle looks like while you're inside Rim Jobs, instead you'll be viewing your vehicle infront of a black background with tire skids moving left and right.\n\nCO-OP:\n\nCo-op is a buggy though humorous experience. Some activities will randomly teleport you out of your vehicle that you're otherwise not supposed to exit, causing you to fail missions. Co-op partners and most NPCs will sometimes get stuck in buildings, vehicles, and other clutter within the game, almost ensuring death.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nOther than completing assassination missions, vehicle thefts, challenges, purhcasing all upgrades, finding all collectables and completing all of the missions, there really isn't much else to do. Just run and gun until your map is fully purple.\n\n\n| Saints Row The Third Combat Demonstration |","May 26, 2014","true","63.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

I was pleasently suprised when it had enough of it's own thing going to get myself and the friend who got it for a multiplayer co-op game to actually have a lot of fun going through it.\n\nBy the time you beat the game you should be a high enough level to be a one man wrecking crew if you have spent your money appropriatly. Which can make the final confrontation kinda lackluster because you are so close to immortal it's not even funny.\n\nThe gameplay is solid with the exception of a few of the activities you have to do. They are not exactly explained well and can possibly force you to complete them with trial and error. Or go look up how they are done.\n\nThe graphics for this game though a little dated now are still pretty solid and hold up as long as you remember the game is several years old.\n\nLast of all I highly recomend playing this game with a friend in co-op mode over just a solo play through because you and your friend can get many a great laugh out of the pop culture references and just creating shananigans for your co-op partner to deal with.","July 25, 2014","true","71.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/radonj/recommended/55230/","radonj","JBecks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/radonj/","276 products in account","I have fond memories of playing Saints Row and Saints Row 2 on the Xbox 360 when I was younger.  Although outdated by today's standards, I had a lot of fun playing them.  They were open-world crime games with fun gameplay and a zany sense of humor.\n\nBut in my opinion, they pale in comparison to Saints Row: The Third.  Right from the first mission, I could tell that this game was going to be a lot of fun.  Saints Row: The Third follows the story of the Third Street Saints, a street gang turned into pop culture icons.  Unfortunately, their popularity becomes their downfall after a bank heist goes awry.\n\nMuch like the first two games, this game has you build up your criminal empire by stealing turf from rival gangs.  Doing missions and side quests helps you gain control of the city.  You don't have to completely drive out the other gangs to finish the game, but it can be satisfying to see the map filled with Saints territory.\n\nAs I said, the story is very similar to the first two games.  However, this isn't a bad thing.  The game is split into 3 acts.  Act 1 is typical Saints Row, but Acts 2 and 3 throw in things that haven't been seen in Saints Row games before.  I don't want to go into too many details for fear of spoiling the story. I will say this though: the game's soundtrack really adds to the missions in the game.  Near the end of the game, there is a certain wrestling match that plays some very inspirational music and makes it absolutely hilarious.\n\nArguably, gameplay is the most important part of open-world crime games.  This is where this game really shines.  The gunplay is fun, melee combat is fun, and driving/flying work very well.  The only problem I had with the gameplay is that getting into vehicles such as the tank or VTOL can be a challenge -- if you aren't at EXACTLY the spot the game wants to be at, your characters does an odd movement and won't get into the vehicles.  This is especially annoying if you are almost dead and trying to escape.  But, that is a very minor complaint in the grand scheme of things.\n\nLastly, I think the mission-based DLC is worth buying.  Get the season pass and skip all of the cosmetic ones (unless you're interested in that).  The mission-based DLC adds a decent length to the game and all three of them are a lot of fun.\n\nI enjoyed this game so much that I played it through to 100% completion. I haven't done that in a game since I got 100% of the achievements in BioShock on Xbox 360.  I haven't tried the co-op mode, but I imagine that it is very fun as well.  If you like open-world crime games that don't take themselves too seriously, then you should definitely buy Saints Row: The Third.","August 8, 2014","true","39.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is over the top vulgar, hilarious, obscene, and fun. It's like GTA if GTA recognized that the only reason it was fun is because of the mayhem you can cause in its sandbox environment. Nearly every campaign mission is designed with this in mind, often offering you infinite ammo with explosives and early access to highly overpowered weapons of mass destruction like aircraft, UAV drone missiles, tanks, etc.. It also has a cheats function (remember those?) so you can play how you'd like to. The music soundtrack is excellent, incorporating everything from Sublime, to hip-hop, to House (courtesy of deadmau5), to metal...the radio stations are all a joy to listen to and the menu music and customization music is also enjoyable. Speaking of customization, this game caters to everyone's need to play dressup. Unlike GTA you can customize just about everything about your character - tattoos, black eyes, build, hair style - it rivals The Elder Scrolls in this regard. You can even give yourself custom taunts and celebrations, *and* pick your voice actor. The guns are upgradable and vary nicely, and you can spend your hard-earned cash not only on property but also upgrades for your character like increased health, dual-wielding, all the way up to infinite ammo. Even your cars can be upgraded and modified, want to punt 24" rims on your Prius? Go ahead! Why not add underglow and a modded engine while you're at it! I was pleasantly surprised with this game since I'm not a huge fan of sandboxes (I don't like collecting arbitrary stuff, which you can in this game too - sex dolls in fact) but the sense of humor and joking atmosphere of Saints Row easily places it as my favorite sandbox game I've yet played.\n\nPros:\n\nHumor\nSountrack\nCustomization factor\nWeapons (upgradable)\nOutrageousness\nFun factor\nVariable gameplay\nCustscene direction\n\nCons:\n\nStupid follower AI\nNo real 'redeeming' factor to this game\n\nWhile going around blowing stuff up and smacking people with a giant purple ♥♥♥♥♥ to a hip-hop soundtrack is fun there isn't anything deeper here. As I said, this is the game your mother warned you about, there isn't really any gaming as art here (you could be pretentious and say the over the top outrageousness is but, whatever) so there isn't any redeeming quality to this game and, as usual, follower AI is incompetent at best, but this game was a lot of fun and very relaxing. The gameplay is solid and varied (lots of cool side missions to do) and overall I had a great time. If you like sandboxes it's a must buy and even if you don't you'll still probably have a lot of fun with the campaign like I did.

The xbox controller on PC just works very fine, and it's very easy to handle all those vehicles commands.\n\nThe mini-games are good too and add a lot to the fun factor, though some of them may seem to be very very difficult.\n\nWell, the story is fun fun and good and I actually played to finish this up cos I was very interested in the mainline history.\n\nThe DLCs are just good, but some of them may kill your gameplay early on (like the tanker or VTOL you get and may easy your life in a ALOT of situations), so if you wanna try the game without the use of the DLCs and bonuses, your gameplay may be very harsh, but worthy at the end.\n\nThe fun and commentaries in this game may be acid and smexy, with a lot of references to some movies and real persons. So don't get yourself surprised if you're in like "I guess I saw this before" when you're playing thru the game and reading the soryline.\n\nFrom 0/10, I give 9 for the overall game. Worth each penny spent on it.\n","March 1, 2015","true","180.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

И это гениальное решение до которого не могут додуматься многие разработчики. Пока одни гоняться за реализмом в поисках лучшей симуляции просмотра телика в игре, эти же разработчики сотворили игру где крутизна твоих яиц чуствует даже в реальной жизни, словно играя в эту игру твои собственные яйца твердеют как орехи.\nИгра действительно возращяет нас к тем временам когда вы играли ради развлечения и фана, не ради того чтобы купить домик покруче, не ради того чтобы красивую машинку в гаражик поставить, и не ради того чтобы ходить на виртуальные свидания.\nВы мать его Святой! Зачем потходить к машине и открывать дверь вытаскивая водителя? когда вы можете с разбегу влететь двумя ногами в лобовое стекло и сразу ехать. Зачем вам покупать домик? когда вы можете ***СПОЙЛЕР-спрыгнуть с вертолета на крышу небоскробе, всех растрелять и сказать что это мать его ваш пентхаус***\nВы берете в руку не просто биту, а биту с гвоздями, вы берете в две руки улучшенный дигл, или ракетницу, или авиаудар, или Компьютер для управления ракетой предатор.\nКасательно сюжета он великолепен. Вы Святые попавшие в новый город, и он должен стать ваш. Какие захваты территорий с фиолетовыми бандами? какие гонки на великах? вы о чем? Чтобы город стал ваш вы грабите военный склад, скупаете предприятия, развиваете проституцию, летает на вертолете и разносите пол города с ракетницы.\nГерои запоминаются. каждый со своим харакетром, каждый со своими фишками и причудами. Город вполне приятного размера, и разнообразен. У вас будут ваши ПентХаусы которые вы будете улучшать, оружие которое будете улучшать, а так же покупать в магазине одежды шмотки, делать тату, и прокачивать тачки.\nИгра созданно для того чтобы вы все время чувстсвовали себя крутыми. Всю игру с любой проблемой ваш персонаж справляется фразой "Поhуй пошли разберемся" или возьмет пистолет в руки "Окей давай проверим че там". Всю игру вы идете вперед всем показывая и доказывая что вы не кто то там, а Лидер Святых, и что вам Святым нет равных, то что вы хотите , то вы и получите.\nПоэтому хватит ныть и писать комменты как вы любите свою GTA, установите Saints Row и дайте вашим яйцам окрепнуть!","August 2, 2014","true","62.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","3"

Saints Row the Third can be accused of being many things, but repetitive isn't one of them.\n\nSome games create atmospheric worlds that attempt to draw you in with moving stories about characters seeking a second chance, or cast you as troubled superheroes who push themselves to the limit to fight evil. Saints Row: The Third is not like those games. Rather, it's the kind of game that gives you weapons called apocafists with which you can punch people, instantly making them explode in a bloody mess. The Third won't impress you with knockout visuals, move you with an absorbing story, or engage you with challenging combat. What it does, better than just about any game before, is embrace the idea of an open world as a place for play, constantly giving you access to awesome new toys and providing you with no shortage of exciting opportunities to use them.\n\nOne thing you definitely shouldn't ignore is the main story. Within just the first few missions, you plummet out of a plane and into an airborne shoot-out, skydive into a penthouse that belongs to a rival gang, use a UAV drone to call in guided missiles on tanks, and more. The missions eventually become a bit predictable for a while, serving as introductions to the other activities and diversions available to you in Steelport. But before long, they get wild again, packing in numerous surprises before culminating in one of two outrageous final missions.\n\nSaints Row: The Third is buoyed to great heights by terrific mission design and by the remarkable assortment of vehicles and weapons it gives you with which to take over Steelport. Whether you're buying up property to increase your hourly income, cruising the city in your favorite vehicle to collect photo ops, drug packages, and sex dolls, or punching people to bits with those crazy apocafists, there's rarely a dull moment. Saints Row: The Third succeeds tremendously at delivering its unique brand of raunchy, outrageous fun. If you have an appetite for this particular kind of absurdity, you won't be disappointed\n\n10/10","January 4","true","172.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Let me start off by saying that in terms of gameplay and mechanics, the Saints Row series is very similar to Grand Theft Auto, a series which I personally have never really been a fan of. But stealing cars and running over ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s isn't what makes this game fun; it's the sheer level of ridiculousness that encompasses, well, every damn thing about this game. Whereas GTA tries to keep things realistic and serious to a degree, SR3 tosses that aside in favor of laser shotguns, deadly game shows and a giant weaponized purple phallus. And that's just the beginning. Everything about this game had me both laughing out loud and awkwardly covering my screen whenever the family was around. And the game isn't all about being outrageously insane; there's an interesting storyline, and a world with lots to explore. Add on some fun side missions and a ton of hilarious minigames (such as driving a tiger around town or running in front of cars to claim insurance money), and the result is the most awkward fun you can have.","December 27, 2012","true","81.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Very funny and humerous through out the missions. Much better then Gta games with the freedom of what you can do. Alot of memeries can be made when playing with friends in co-op, when you free roam or even do missions. Excellent for playing friends in co-op missions or free roaming.\n\nThe first mission is a excellent one it puts you right in the mood of how this game will be straight a way. A great way to tell if you will like it or not. A lot of time can be put into the game completing the campaign or even just earning achieviments and free roaming.\n\nThe ending fell a bit short as it was slightly hard and not as entaining than the rest of the missions, no spoilers sorry. you will have to find out your self. But the customization was excellent, you can customize and upgrade your cars to your hearts content. Even with upgrading your abillities was great. You can customize your cribs, your gang, your cars and last but not least your self, as far as clothing and abillities go.\n\nThe controls were very nice and easy to learn even for flying aircrafts, a beginner for games can learn the controls nearly instantly. They are very straight forward as far as that goes. The physics are also very well done with the driving and flying, they were very realistic and smooth. I love the fact that you can go sky diving it was awesome.\n\nThe weapon range and upgrades for them went forever. From ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to rocket launchers they had nearly anything you would like to kill someone with. The upgrades for them were awesome going from a cheap shotgun to a fully automatic spaz was awesome to see. Love the fart bomb, just love it.\nYou will have some great action playing this game. Not many let downs at all. I would give it a 9.8/10 because nothing is perfect but this game does come close to it.","June 22, 2014","true","79.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are plenty of activities but most are just dreadfully boring.\n\nThe game also suffers from various random crashes, frame stuttering, and crappy console input mappings (e.g., open door / pick up item / grab / throw / revive / answer / start activity: all in one button!).\n\nThe first Saints Row had a plot, a coherence in the city layout and its gangs, challenging situations, in-depth player customization and better immersion. Where SR3 just surpasses in silliness and graphics.\n\nNote that the game contains mature sexual themes and mosaic blurred full frontal nudity, so you may want to reconsider before gifting this game to random kids.\n\nAlso, it is best to finish the game at least once before getting the DLC's, since there's no way to disable them, and some DLC completely ruin the gameplay since they're basically cheat codes.","August 18, 2012","true","82.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/1682/recommended/55230/","1682","void-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/1682/","612 products in account","Saints Row: The Third, an open-world third person shooter released for the Xbox 360, PS3, and PC is a game that will give you a few laughs here and there, but other than that, it doesn't really do much more. Don't get me wrong, I like this game, it's just that when I look at it from a technical standpoint, it doesn't try anything new. Sure, the jokes are funny, and some of the activites are hilarious, but let me tell you why it isn't a game that will be remembered for years to come.\n\nAfter the events of Saints Row 2, you (The Boss) have become a celebrity icon, and the Saints name is now a household brand. With people like Pierce in your crew selling energy drinks, sneakers and other merchandise, it all seems well and good. But as the Saints reach higher and higher to fame, a legendary criminal fraternity known as "The Syndicate" has noticed the Saints and demand they give up. The Saints refuse this offer, which then starts a fight that leads you to a new city, Steelport.\n\nThe excitement level in this game is up there around the 8's. This is a Saints Row game, and there is nothing like it. In this game, you'll be expecting lots of explosions, shooting and giant purple ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to kill your enemies with. In this city, you're free to do as you desire, and everything you do seems fluid. Sure, some enemies may get suck in walls from time to time, but the controls themselves are easy to learn, and you shouldn't be having any problems.\n\nThe game itself doesn't look so great. Sure, it isn't bad, but just don't go around expecting to see outstanding and mind-bending visuals. If you have an average PC, you should be able to run this game at around 30-40 FPS on medium settings. What amazed me though, was that despite me having so much explosions on the screen at one time, I didn't expirence any frame drops, everything ran at a steady 50 and that's what I like to see. The character models are below average for a game released in 2011 and the same goes for the cars.\n\nWhile you're driving in your car, you have the option to listen to various radio stations within Steelport. If you like any genre of music, expect to find it here. From Dubstep to Rock the soundtrack is good, but not much better than that.\n\nNow if you remember, I said that this wasn't a "great" or "amazing" game at the start, and i'm not hating on it yet, infact, i'm not hating on it at all at this point. But when you start to play the game itself, you will notice some problems. If you expected a deep story line, this isn't a game for you. It's whacky and silly and makes next to no sense at some points. After you've finished the 5-6 hour campaign, you can never play those missions, again. For some reason, Volition didn't allow you to replay missions like you could do in previous Saints Row games, which seems rather odd to me. So now you're in an open world and free to do whatever you want to (again). There are some fun activites such as insurance fraud and mayhem, but other than that, most are pretty mediocore and don't really take much skill and are just stolen ideas from other games. Killing cops can get really boring if you've done it thousands of times over. So if you've finished the story, you're either left with doing some boring activites that give you no reward or just shooting people.\n\nSaints Row: The Third is a game that will give you a few chuckles, but that's it. It's worth your money, but just don't be expecting an amazing game like Bioshock Infinite or The Walking Dead. Overall, I give Saints Row: The Third a score of 7.5. Thank you for reading my review.

Don't let my hours on Steam fool you.\n\nIn my mind Saints Row: The Third is the funnest in the franchise. It's not the best story of the franchise (I think that's Saints Row 2 in my book), but it's the funnest. In fact it might be one of the funnest games I've ever played.. for the simple fact of how crazy it really is. It NEVER takes itself seriously.. you can upgrade your pistols to have explosive rounds, beat people with a giant purple ♥♥♥♥♥ baseball bat, throw a "fart in a jar" at people, run around completly naked and you can even create a full on zombie to play as complete with a zombie voice! The humour is awesome and the gameplay is great. The only thing is that towards the end of the game you can become TOO overpowered.. with "upgrades" that are basically cheat codes... allowing unlimited ammo, invincibilty, etc. but you don't have to buy them so it's really your choice. Overall an awesome game definitly worth the money.","September 27, 2015","true","13.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It wants you to be random and just enjoy the game without consequences; something I suspect Volition went out of their way to ensure. The controls (aside from the still foreign weapon select) are tight and the controller integration is very solid (Thanks Team!) so it made SRTT a very enjoyable/playable experience to me.\n\nThe story is just hilarious, the graphics are still holding their own and the driving is just fantastic compared to other titles (I am looking at you GTA). In fact, every game should have a quick steal option for cars modelled after SRTT. This series has always done Character Creation well but this time around it is just MENTAL. There is a slider for EVERYTHING! You can truly make your character your own which is just an awesome finishing touch for this game.\n\nMy only two complaints with the game are prehaps the side missions could have had some degree of integration with the main story (aside from just being fun things to do) and that the story missions (whilst being selectable in the phone) didn't have a clear indication of which order you should play them in. I kind of just shotgunned an entire characters worth of story in a single hit and got a bit lost until I realised it tied in with other missions I hadn't played yet. These are just minor gripes however and you might have a completely different outlook on these issues.\n\nSo, should you buy it? Yes.

The characters are pretty despicable, but the gameplay is just straight up fun.  All of the side missions are pretty enjoyable.  You spend the entire game just creating mayhem wherever you go.  Has quite a good collection of tunes to listen to while doing all of this.  Driving is fun.  The flying isn't bad, but can be irksome.  Get the entire package since it is going for pretty cheap these days.  All of the extra content makes this a game you can expect to get a lot of entertainment from.  Highly recommend.\n\nThe only downside to the game are the "activities".  These things just flat out SUCK.  They are completely uninspired and lack any sort of thing that can be considered to be fun.  They are basically just tacked on crap.  They include such things as driving a tiger around while it is attacking you, escort missions (perhaps the worst of the worst), riding a motorcycle around inside a computer simulation, etc., etc.  I despise these things.  It is a requirement if you want to unlock certain things in game though.  God.

Weapons system and using the XBOX 360 Controller on my laptop is taking some getting used to and some of the objectives in game are a bit difficult (First scene trying to take down the helicopter) And then the second scene where your jumping out of the airplane - The game does get credit from me by detecting if your stuck - It shows you a reminder of the controls and what to do next. Was also surprised my laptop ran it reasonably - Had to use the Direct X 9 mode and turn down some of the details to get a playable framerate but all in all I've had a reasonable experience.\n\nA warning to parents - This game has excessive swearing and allows you to freely kill other people that would get you arrested and possibly put in prison for life - Or even a worse sentence. Parents should preview this game using online video sources before deciding to let their kids  play or purchase this game.","April 20, 2014","true","2.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwait/recommended/55230/","gwait","gwait","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwait/","805 products in account","Certainly one of the best open world games out there. What makes this game unique is that it takes the options out of the window of any normal open world game out there and recreates it much better.\n\nStarting off with the character selection, you are given lots of options for clothing, taunts or even the voice of your character. The missions are well constructed and in different missions you are able to do different actions such as flying through a plane and killing everyone inside it, going out the end and the plane exploding to landing on a skyscraper with a parachute and killing everyone in a party to claim the building as yours.\n\nNot only the missions are well constructed, but also the voices and the dialogue between characters. I feel like the dialogue brings you into the game because they are out of the ordinary you would expect in an open world game. From singing a song in a car with Pierce to making funny jokes between characters.\n\nOut of missions, you can hit up a car or plane delivery or just hit up your homie for backup in a gun fight. This game even has a challenge system which allows you to play the game for longer by having to land a parachute in a specific spot multiple times or having to jump over multiple bridges in the game. The challenges also include different minigames such as Insurance Fraud where you have to ragdoll between cars and get the highest score possible to destroying everything with a tank. This you did not expect, did you?\n\nOf course in this game you have a co-op so you can do missions with a friend whilst talking on a microphone.\nThe disadvantages come from the co-op side of the game as once you create a co-op game you have to host the game from your local machine as there are no servers for SR3 itself. If your Internet is bad then your co-op partner will also suffer from stuttering. Also for co-op you are not able to chat in-game apart from messaging each other from Steam and having to Click Shift+Tab everytime you want to send a message which is very annoying.\n\nMoving out of co-op, this game is also poorly optimized so if you don't have good specifications for your computer, you can wish about playing this game. Please be sure to check whether you meet the specified requirements first before purchasing this.\n\nBut in overall, excluding the co-op disadvantages the game is well presented and it brings open world games to the whole new level since it is not focused on the missions itself mainly. 8/10 for this game.","December 31, 2013","true","128.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

It has been quite a while since I beat the game and for most of it I played LAN coop with a roommate. I remember that we both loved the game and laughed the whole way through it, I remember thinking everything about the game was just pure unadulterated fun and that nothing would be able to top it. Yet now, I look back and really don’t have any interest in the game. Perhaps the whole Saints Row formula was just a fad and is now past its prime.\n\nI can’t in good conscious give this game a “not recommend” because I lost countless hours causing chaos in the vibrant open world of Steel Port. However, I think it’s fair to warn future shoppers that the humor and gameplay of Saints Row 3 will entertain those it’s targeted at, but at the same time has the potential to rapidly become stale.","November 25, 2014","true","88.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Sounds fun, but actually you get immune to it all pretty fast.\nOne point I found particularly troublesome is that it only displays the name of an item that you come across as you are wandering about.  You need your chav ”bling-o-pedia” there to work out which is best, or you are more than likely to accidentally downgrade, as I did, several times.\nAlso the game has a very console feel to it and a bewildering array of key presses that vary in function depending what you are doing.\nAll in all, pretty well executed, and  great for a few minutes if you want to impress your friends with a dose of  "chaving", but after the first hour or so it becomes monotonous and boring.\nRecommended? It's really not my type of game, but I guess that if it is your type of thing then I have to acknowledge that it is a accomplished game, so I will say yes - with reservations.

With collectables scatered around the fairly big open world you will spend a lot of time looking for collectables or you could just buy a upgrade that tells you where the collectables are which i think is cheating. In the upgrade system therer is a lot for you to upgrade as level up in respect some upgrades are abilitys some are weapons and others are just cheats without using the cheat system like when you get to level 49 you can become imune to bullets.\nOverall i would give it a 8/10","May 28, 2014","true","156.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sounds fun, but actually you get immune to it all pretty fast.\nOne point I found particularly troublesome is that it only displays the name of an item that you come across as you are wandering about.  You need your chav ”bling-o-pedia” there to work out which is best, or you are more than likely to accidentally downgrade, as I did, several times.\nAlso the game has a very console feel to it and a bewildering array of key presses that vary in function depending what you are doing.\nAll in all, pretty well executed, and  great for a few minutes if you want to impress your friends with a dose of  "chaving", but after the first hour or so it becomes monotonous and boring.\nRecommended? It's really not my type of game, but I guess that if it is your type of thing then I have to acknowledge that it is a accomplished game, so I will say yes - with reservations.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/7cuong/recommended/55230/","7cuong","Cuong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/7cuong/","142 products in account","As an analogy, I have always seen the "Saints Row"-series as the younger, funnier and immature brother of the "Grand Theft Auto"-series. This is what the creators of SR probably had in mind when they were making their game. The rate of absurd immaturity isn't necessarily negative, au contraire; it creates that light and amusing atmosphere that I've come to expect of Saints Row.\n\nPros:\n+ Very amusing\n+ Absurd, though great humour\n+ Simple & clean upgrade system\n+ Great character & vehicle customisation (which personally always makes the game a lot more fun for me)\n+ A lot of diversity (more on this in the cons though)\n+ Cool NPCs\n\nCons:\n- Main story arch is too short in my opinion\n- Frustrating AI (which is a problem in lots of other games too)\n- Although SR likes to mix up the missions and activities, you might actually feel that the everything is quite repetitive\n- Even though the NPCs are great, I think that you should be able to spend more time with them and get to know them better, they are after all " your crew"\n\nConclusion:\nSaints Row: The Third is a great successor to the previous game and meets my expectations of the game, which doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement. Playing the game was very satsifying though I doubt I will playing more than two playthroughs, except if my OCD were to kick in and make me want to get all the achievements.\n\nMy score for SR3 would be 7.5/10","April 11, 2015","true","48.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I find the Saints Row series a must have for hours and hours of fun I never play a game twice due to my hyperactive nature but this is one of the games that I wanted to play again on Hard difficulty (( still rather easy if you ask me )). I recommend Saints Row for people who are bored or are looking for aimless fun this game can take up many hours of your life just to finish it and then capturing and finishing all activies and collectibles? Damn there's no match for Saints Row's fun factor.\n","December 30, 2013","true","51.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Short if open-world, third-person, gang/crime game there is little else that can be said is the same so that's as far as I'll compare them.\n\nThe best part about this game is that it knows what it is. It knows it isn't gritty or realistic and it panders to that crazy over-the-topness that you know you occasionally want from a game. While there are of course many elements that are "normal" (escort missions, forced vehicle "sections", etc) the tight game play and bright, colorful world and enemy design makes them enjoyable. Besides as soon as you're done you can go play in traffic or drive around with a tiger in the passengers seat as much as you want (both actual mini-games).\n\nThe game really does a pretty good job of pacing. You start out feeling pretty weak, avoiding conflict and fleeing from bigger fights, but by the end you are running into a military compound because you have an extra case of rockets laying around. It also does a good job of avoiding the trap of over stimulating the player with too much too soon and I really never felt like it was dragging or tired.\n\nOf course there are issues (you can break the money system using an age old method) but at the end of the day this game is just plain FUN, like games should be. I wholeheartedly recommend buying this game although the best method is probably to wait for the Complete Package to go on sale.","November 25, 2013","true","163.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only good DLC's are Gangstas In Space, Trouble With Clones, and Geinkeibowl IIV. Those contain fun addon missions that add 10+ more hours.\n\nTake over the city\n\nThe game features territory that either belongs to the 3rd street saints (you), morningstar, luchadores, or deckers. Eliminate drug deals, buy stores, or complete fun activities to take the territory, and see your crew move into your new land. In doing so, get an hourly income so you can upgrade your guy, and more. Have "cribs" and safehouses for when you progress through the story, where you can access your arsenel of weapons, cars, and air vehicles, sometimes even boats.\n\nCustomization\n\nCustomize your guns to make them more powerful and badass, cars to make them more durable, powerful, and faster. Even upgrade your cribs A.K.A. strongholds to look bigger and give you better things with each upgrade. You can upgrade your person for more abilities, combat upgrades, health upgrades, and lots more.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game is fun, kickass, and a good time. Find yourself just spending hours going around in a tank and cause chaos. Call in your "homies" to help in combat, and recruit them by holding Z to follow you. Drive many varieties of vehicles and use many types of guns. Complete assassinations, and steal cars for money.\n\nStory\n\nThe story is fantastic, don't listen to what people say bad about it. Sure, it's way to unrealistic, but since when was this game unrealistic? Each mission is either an introduction into another activity, or a real big and non linear mission. 40 missions in game, 15 of which are activity starters, an the rest are fun missions to help rebuild your respect.\n\nHope this review was helpful, please like this or leave a comment if it helped.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/recommended/55230/","gamerrubrix","Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/","300 products in account","Saints Row: The Third is an Open World Action Adventure game. The story follows the Third Street Saints, a street gang that evolved into huge multimedia celebrity icons. After losing their most respected member, Johnny Gat, in an attempt to kill the Syndcate leader, the Saints are led by "The Boss" (Who is your character) to get revenge and try to take over the rest of the gangs that lay in the city of Steelport however they can, ensuring the Saints are the only ones in charge.\n\nIf you're more of a fan of the serious and realistic tone the first two Saints Row games did, you might be disappointed here. The game is more about comedy and crazy situations now. That's a good thing in one way though, because it leaves tons of room for variety and interesting settings, plus very good writing and humor done by the team, Volition. You could be riding a motorcycle in cyberspace, going into a zombie infested area of Steelport, or just unleash mayhem in a huge tank. Lots of scenarios and possibilities, always keeping the game fresh. I really do believe the character and story is the highlight of this game. It's funny, memorable, and has great characters. Even The Boss, the character you create, is a witty and interesting person, but has a serious side too when the job needs to be done. I'll say it again, the scenarios you're put in along with the great writing makes this game worth playing just for the story alone. You'll love it.\n\n\n\n\nThe gameplay is pretty similar to Grand Theft Auto. You can go around Steelport, do whatever you want, you have "Noterity" which is basically your wanted level (Noteriety can be caught by other gangs or the police, depending on what you do). There's main missions, side missions, minigames, secrets, collectables, lots of stuff to do you'd expect in a game like this. The main story might take you about 6 hours if you don't care to do anything else. Doing everything else however, will more than double your time for sure, it really adds onto the gameplay. In my opinion, some minigames are better than others, but they're fun overall. There's reasons why, which I'll get to in a minute.\n\n\n\n\nThe side stuff you can do is very huge. You can literally play in traffic and hurt yourself a bunch of times by running into cars to get points. That's the randomness factor here. You can also go in a tank and blow things up, rescue hookers to recruit them to be saints, escort friends to make deals while you defend their position, or blowing up things with an RPG in a helicopter on the side of a building. And soooo much more. The only problem is... The AI can be very, VERY terrible at times, and it's generally not good when it's your friends. Your friends are so stupid when they try to go back in the car with you, run somewhere, or do anything really. Some missions like escort missions are an absolute pain because of it. And when your partner is driving, it's likely they can get stuck on a tiny piece of metal. Shameful.\n\n(Side note: If you own certain DLC, you got even more side mission variety avaliable to you.)\n\n\n\n\nCustomization is a big part of this game. You can make The Boss look however you like, and if you own all the DLC, you already have tons of options from the start. Also, I'm not kidding when I say that, you can make him/her look like anything. Or just completely naked. That works too. I think creative players will have a great time trying to make a character they really enjoy. There's also 3 Male voices, and 3 Female voices, so you even got some voice variety here too. Weapons and your vehicles have lots of customization too, same as above.\n\n\n\n\nSo overall, Saints Row The Third is a brilliantly written and funny game with a memorable story and fun gameplay with lots of variety thanks to the random nature and setting you're put in. If you're looking for a sillier, more different GTA that keeps you on the edge of your seat with a little less polish, you'll definitely love Saints Row 3 and 4.\n\n8/10","August 1, 2015","true","20.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

But if you want, to can just ignore the story for as long as you want and commit vehicular manslaughter by the hundreds, blow s**t up or just run around and explore.\nSimply put, if you like over-the-top humour and Grand Theft Auto, you will like this game.

This is what the creators of SR probably had in mind when they were making their game. The rate of absurd immaturity isn't necessarily negative, au contraire; it creates that light and amusing atmosphere that I've come to expect of Saints Row.\n\nPros:\n+ Very amusing\n+ Absurd, though great humour\n+ Simple & clean upgrade system\n+ Great character & vehicle customisation (which personally always makes the game a lot more fun for me)\n+ A lot of diversity (more on this in the cons though)\n+ Cool NPCs\n\nCons:\n- Main story arch is too short in my opinion\n- Frustrating AI (which is a problem in lots of other games too)\n- Although SR likes to mix up the missions and activities, you might actually feel that the everything is quite repetitive\n- Even though the NPCs are great, I think that you should be able to spend more time with them and get to know them better, they are after all " your crew"\n\nConclusion:\nSaints Row: The Third is a great successor to the previous game and meets my expectations of the game, which doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement. Playing the game was very satsifying though I doubt I will playing more than two playthroughs, except if my OCD were to kick in and make me want to get all the achievements.\n\nMy score for SR3 would be 7.5/10","April 11, 2015","true","48.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To me, they are what GTA could have been, but with a much less serious note.\nThis story picks up in a most humerous way, following our gang of miscreants as they journey to a new city, not by choice, and have to pick up from the bottom. But not so far on the bottom. If you finished Saints Row the 2nd you understand that they are not down and out by any means, and you will understand why.\nThe only thing I am not enjoying as much is that I have all the DLC, which is not a bad thing, but STEAM installs it all from the bundle at once, so I have all these things that would not have been available in a normal first time play through. Some of it could be a bit OP, so I just ignore those items and play straight. I also didnt realize that you could not turn on / off the DLC. As long as you dont begin the game with the addition of the OP vehicles in use you will love the it all.\nLooking forward to many many hours here, and just like the other Saints series so far, replayability is HIGH!\nEIDT: Duh, realized I could turn off the DLC under properties... So the OP stuff is gone. It also allowed my save game to load fine. I started a new one though since the money was way over the top from the DLC's.\nTotally worth it as part of the SR collection.","November 25, 2014","true","95.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But, this is definitely not a criticism, It's a compliment. Too many games of this nature are engaging with realism and this game gives you a well needed break, and just lets you relax and have fun. To put it another way, it resembles an action movie (where everything is very unrealistic). The graphics are also a nice touch. Again, non-realistic and cartoonish. It has a nice style that I never get sick of.\nThe setting has now shifted from Stillwater to Steelport with the Saints now trying to assume control of new territory and the set up is all the same as before. The story carries on from the second game despite a change in location as usual rival gangs occupy the city and the STAG army are sent in to try control things. The main story missions are all well executed despite most been in bonkers territory from gunfights while skydiving right through too becoming a walking toilet (yes I kid you not).\nApart from mission games there are plenty of mini games that you can do in your own time that aren't part of the central story but will help you control more of the city which enables you to make more money to buy more weapons and upgrades and so on. What's also nice is that there are decisions to make along the way that affect the outcome of the game. You can side with an army type organisation and they'll aid you take over parts of the city or you can side with another faction and this will help you in other ways.\n","February 24","true","48.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Ok, so maybe I miss spraying ♥♥♥♥ on people, but overall it's still a funtastically over-the-top crazy game of creativity, imagination, and mayhem. Just about anything and everything can be unlocked, customized, or upgraded. There's all kinds of different missions to experience, lots of whacky things to see and hear (and a few things maybe you don't want to see), and plenty of laughs in store. Coop is available once again doubling the fun factor--just try it once and you'll find out what I'm talking about.\n\nFor anyone looking to take life a little less seriously, pick up Saints Row: The Third and you'll be whisked far from the land of reality.

This is more hallucination than reality. Nothing feels real, and yet there is a certain illusion of reality. If all the violence and many other things were real, than it would take certain personality disorders and worse to enjoy this. I see it as a postmodern take on the GTA genre. All the sexism, killing and crime is so out of proportion that everything collapses in cartoon explosions. Now, it is absurdist and surreal. Saints Row 3 is not meant to be taken seriously simply because it is all surface.

Outfits and Car Customizations look really cool, and the game is moddable. This game series destroyed GTA for me, it is just way more fun.

The story isn't perfect , but it's not that bad.","December 1, 2015","true","30.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only good DLC's are Gangstas In Space, Trouble With Clones, and Geinkeibowl IIV. Those contain fun addon missions that add 10+ more hours.\n\nTake over the city\n\nThe game features territory that either belongs to the 3rd street saints (you), morningstar, luchadores, or deckers. Eliminate drug deals, buy stores, or complete fun activities to take the territory, and see your crew move into your new land. In doing so, get an hourly income so you can upgrade your guy, and more. Have "cribs" and safehouses for when you progress through the story, where you can access your arsenel of weapons, cars, and air vehicles, sometimes even boats.\n\nCustomization\n\nCustomize your guns to make them more powerful and badass, cars to make them more durable, powerful, and faster. Even upgrade your cribs A.K.A. strongholds to look bigger and give you better things with each upgrade. You can upgrade your person for more abilities, combat upgrades, health upgrades, and lots more.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game is fun, kickass, and a good time. Find yourself just spending hours going around in a tank and cause chaos. Call in your "homies" to help in combat, and recruit them by holding Z to follow you. Drive many varieties of vehicles and use many types of guns. Complete assassinations, and steal cars for money.\n\nStory\n\nThe story is fantastic, don't listen to what people say bad about it. Sure, it's way to unrealistic, but since when was this game unrealistic? Each mission is either an introduction into another activity, or a real big and non linear mission. 40 missions in game, 15 of which are activity starters, an the rest are fun missions to help rebuild your respect.\n\nHope this review was helpful, please like this or leave a comment if it helped.

It's a lot of fun. It's a 3rd person shooter which has you thrown into crazy action scene that are so unbelievable, yet so awesome. The story is pretty decent, it's nothing special or anything. The whole campaign can be played cooperativity. The gameplay is great, some glitches here and there. The music in this game is pretty good, isn't topping any Grand Theft Auto. Some of the biggest problems with this game lie with it's upgrade system. You can pretty much become God with max upgrades. I would recommend never upgrading a single thing too keep the game challenging. With all said, it's still a fun a crazy game.\n\n5/5 - Outstanding","June 28, 2013","true","111.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It's still a fun game, and recommended, but a lack of content volume (not variety) disappoints after the plethora of activities in Saints Row 2.\n\n+ Good gun-play, character upgrade path, weapon upgrade path.\n+ Graphics are really good (DX11) if your machine is powerful enough to turn the settings up (a far render distance is pretty taxing).\n+ The story is ostentatiously stupid fun - like a fantastic B-movie - if you can enjoy it for what it is, and not expect something more serious like Saints Row 2.\n+ Good voice acting from everyone.\n+ Some fun new activities, and most of the old activities are back: Escort, Trail-blazing, Mayhem, Hostage, and more, as well as new variants (like Tank Mayhem), or new activities entirely (Guardian Angel, Assassinations).\n+ Autos are still customizeable, most of the options staying the same. The vehicles drive better than than the ones in SR2, though there are fewer varieties.\n+Tons of personal costume and character customizations.\n\n+ / - Lots of R-rated content. Just saying. I mean, it is a Saints Row game. But when one of the available melee weapons is a giant d**k bat that is called the "Penetrator" - yeah...\n\n- While the activites are fun, and there are a lot of activity icons that appear on the map, there aren't very many of them. In Sants Row 2, each activity had 6 levels to be completed. Here, there is just ONE instance of each activity at a map icon. Early in the game, completing some activities unlocks more of the same activity (at another location) at a higher difficulty, which is fine. But there is a LOT LESS content here. Got the game to 92% completion in 32.3 hours.\n- Lots of DLC. With a lot less content already, be sure to get Saints Row: The Third - The Full Package - or don't bother buying the game.\n- Crib customization is GONE. This really bummed me. Yes, there are three cribs / strongholds that can be upgraded, but the upgrades are all pre-determined, and don't change look / layout of your crib (upgrading can make the building taller, giving you a higher view, but that's about it).\n\nTemper your content expectations and Saints Row: The Third becomes a gleeful B-movie romp, missing the seriousness of Saints Row 2 and the all-out insanity of Saints Row IV. Recommended at a minimum of 50% off (which happens during most major sales events).","June 21, 2015","true","104.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But, this is definitely not a criticism, It's a compliment. Too many games of this nature are engaging with realism and this game gives you a well needed break, and just lets you relax and have fun. To put it another way, it resembles an action movie (where everything is very unrealistic). The graphics are also a nice touch. Again, non-realistic and cartoonish. It has a nice style that I never get sick of.\nThe setting has now shifted from Stillwater to Steelport with the Saints now trying to assume control of new territory and the set up is all the same as before. The story carries on from the second game despite a change in location as usual rival gangs occupy the city and the STAG army are sent in to try control things. The main story missions are all well executed despite most been in bonkers territory from gunfights while skydiving right through too becoming a walking toilet (yes I kid you not).\nApart from mission games there are plenty of mini games that you can do in your own time that aren't part of the central story but will help you control more of the city which enables you to make more money to buy more weapons and upgrades and so on. What's also nice is that there are decisions to make along the way that affect the outcome of the game. You can side with an army type organisation and they'll aid you take over parts of the city or you can side with another faction and this will help you in other ways.\n","February 24","true","48.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

There's more than enough here to keep you playing for hours on end and a full 100% playthrough will take about 24 hours but with the addition of co-op, there's tons of replay value - it's also moddable. What's not to like. The side activities are a great diversion, they let you: rampage in a tank for points; blow stuff up for points; play a game show for points and more (for points.) It's the kind of stuff that you typically do in an open world game like this but this way it feels less grindy or boring to do like some other games *cough*gta4 bowling*cough* Now for the negatives - It's pretty easy to beat. I finished the main plot and a few side missions withing 12 hours on the hardest difficulty - I have the full package/goty and even then with the "op" dlc weapons, I beat the whole thing with pistols. Also, some of the checkpointing is awful. In some sections where I get cheaply killed to say a tank appearing out of nowhere or a car exploding, it can send you back to the very start of a 5 minute hold out or protection task\n\nPros:\n-Lots to do\n-Great fun\n-Engaging side quests\n-Co-op\n-Mods\n-Decent story - infact I liked it, as rediculious as it got (you play as a toilet in one mission)\n\nCons:\n-Really easy on hard mode\n-Awful Checkpoints\n-Useless weapons - use the pistols\n\nTLDR: Great game, lots to do but it's fairly easy and it's badly checkpointed 8/10 Buy it","January 26, 2015","true","19.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","1"

Honestly, in my books the only thing GTA does better is graphics.\n\nRecommended to everyone who isn't averse to anything described above and likes the idea of basically playing the Anti-Hero in a hilariously mad action blockbuster (In a good way).\n","September 19, 2015","true","35.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That said it still has WAY more than I've ever enjoyed from Grand Theft Auto, and the story is HILLARIOUS and FUN, Customization dominates GTA, mainly since besides clothes GTA has almost none now. Also Girls can play Female Characters, I enjoyed this with my girlfriend, she loved all the jokes and oversexualization of everything. Outfits and Car Customizations look really cool, and the game is moddable. This game series destroyed GTA for me, it is just way more fun. All it needs is more Multiplayer and more Content to keep up with the previous versions as far as sidequests and story options.

But, this is definitely not a criticism, It's a compliment. Too many games of this nature are engaging with realism and this game gives you a well needed break, and just lets you relax and have fun. To put it another way, it resembles an action movie (where everything is very unrealistic). The graphics are also a nice touch. Again, non-realistic and cartoonish. It has a nice style that I never get sick of.\nThe setting has now shifted from Stillwater to Steelport with the Saints now trying to assume control of new territory and the set up is all the same as before. The story carries on from the second game despite a change in location as usual rival gangs occupy the city and the STAG army are sent in to try control things. The main story missions are all well executed despite most been in bonkers territory from gunfights while skydiving right through too becoming a walking toilet (yes I kid you not).\nApart from mission games there are plenty of mini games that you can do in your own time that aren't part of the central story but will help you control more of the city which enables you to make more money to buy more weapons and upgrades and so on. What's also nice is that there are decisions to make along the way that affect the outcome of the game. You can side with an army type organisation and they'll aid you take over parts of the city or you can side with another faction and this will help you in other ways.\n","February 24","true","48.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

One time i was in a mission and i was driving on a bridge until abrubtly outta nowhere like a RKO i feel through the thick piece of concrete supported by two giant pillars also made of concrete. plz fix\n\nOverall this game runs smoothly most of the time if you dont go spastic with explosions other than that this is a great game that most of the time makes no sense.\n\n9/10","May 22","true","15.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/55230/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","I came into this game after having finished Saints Row 4 and 2 first, in that order. The difference between 2 and 4 is drastic, so I was interested to see where The Third would be in relation to those two. As one might assume it’s somewhere in the middle. The second game had missions with only light scripting and a big dose of unpredictable chaos at the hand of the AI and world simulation, while the fourth game was more directed and scripted with a big emphasis on comedy. It can be hard to describe just how different the two feel when actually playing. The closest thing I’ve experienced in other games to the feeling of out of control madness in Saints Row 2 is in the Stalker games. The fourth might at first glance appear even crazier than the second game, but it’s a chaos that feels highly predictable and in control of the creators. The Third tries to do both things, and doesn’t do it as well as either 2 or 4 did. It is without a doubt the worst Saints Row game I’ve played yet.\n\nFor the most part Saints Row The Third is perfectly fine. Visually it’s a huge improvement over the second game, and in general the level of polish is on another level. The problem though is that many of the changes make the game more conventional, and as a result a bit boring. For example the weapons and enemy types have changed quite a bit from the second game. Almost all the weapons in Saints Row 2 felt powerful, and in The Third the majority of the guns suck. They aren’t loud enough, and they don’t do enough damage which creates a frustrating bullet sponge feel, even when fighting the weakest enemies. This made many weapons unusable, like all the shotguns and all the submachine guns.\n\nThe biggest issue though I had with The Third is the story. In both 2 and 4 it was excellent! Great antagonists and a good sense of progression and character development with proper last acts that resolved everything going on in the games. Real solid work, unlike The Third where it’s more of a mess that doesn’t go anywhere. As far as games go The Third is still alright, and it has several high points, especially in the second half of the game. But it wasn’t nearly as good as the other two, and it felt unfinished. In about a third of the missions there were abrupt cuts where it seemed like there should have been a cutscene, but there was nothing. It also ended a couple hours before I expected it to. Several things are left unresolved, which added to the feeling that they were forced to cut things from the game. Everything that’s in the game is very well polished, but there are gaps, like the ending.\n\nBecause the game mechanics are more polished than the second game this feels like an easier game to recommend on one level. But on the other hand I just didn’t enjoy it as much because of that. The second game was on the surface a shoddier game, but while I was playing it there’s no question I was enjoying it more. The fourth game blows The Third out of the water in terms of story, humor, character and just about everything. Even the use of music in the fourth game is a notch above The Third. This is still a good game, but play the other two first.\n","January 26, 2014","true","12.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As the leader of the criminal gang The Saints you will steel cars, take people hostage, blow stuff up, pick fights with random passerby’s  and in general cause mayhem and destruction.\n\nYou will kill members of other gangs to gain control over their neighborhood and you will be asked to participate in rather random acts of violence. Almost every act of crime and destruction is rewarded with cash and respect. Both can be used (in different ways) to improve your characters abilities.\n\nThe smart thing about the game is that it doesn’t take itself seriously. At all. The knowing wink that states ‘we know this is just a game’ and the low-brow humor could have been annoying.\n\nThe fact that you will meet the same NPC’s over and over again and that few of your actions have permanent consequences  could have been a major disappointment.\n\nBut when a game is this amoral (or even immoral), it helps that there is no illusion of a real world filled with real people.\n\n--- --- ---\n\nSteelport, the city where the Saints roam, seems to exist in its own reality. And of course it does. Murder, theft and all kinds of depravity don’t have real consequences. It’s difficult to mourn the death of an NPC you just shot to steel his car. You know you will meet the exact same NPC again and again.\n\nYou can destroy a large part of the town, only to discover that 10 minutes later the city has been rebuild.\n\nYou can shoot a police officer for no reason, use your in game smartphone to call one of your fellow gang members to ask for ‘police forgiveness’ and watch other police officers just walk away.\n\nYou see, normally I try to do ‘the right thing’ in games. But Saints Row: The Third makes it possible to enjoy being a criminal by taking away the guilt.\n\nBut I must admit that at some point something strange happened. I started to like these characters. Early on in the game your character starts singing along with an NPC and that felt good. When near the end of the game I raced through town to save one of my friends and Bonnie Tyler started to sing “I Need a Hero” I felt heroic.\n\nIt helped that I made the protagonist female. Voiced by the excellent Laura Bailey (Female Voice 1) she became somebody that I liked and I could accept her violent side.\n\nI even indulged in some character building. I made the character overweight since I figured she wouldn’t have much self-constraint. I gave her practical clothes since she is a person of action. I made her look like somebody in her mid-thirties because that made sense for a ‘boss’.\n\nAnd this is the sign of a good game: despite the occasional flawed gameplay and design, despite the fact that the game glorifies crime and violence, I finished the game not just for me, but also for her.","March 7, 2014","true","237.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

Noch mehr Spaß macht es im Coop Modus indem alle Missionen gespielt werden können. Ich selber habe dieses Game 2 mal durchgespielt. Einmal alleine und einmal im Coop Modus. Wer »Saints Row The Third« nicht liebt, der nimmt Videospiele viel zu ernst. Oder eben nicht ernst genug.

The story of the game was amazing and kept me and my friend wanting to just skip everything and go throught the story just to see what happens. This is how good the story is. Here are some of the best features of the game:\n\n- The game never really forces you to do any missions. You can explore the world and do crazy stuff before beginning a mission.\n- Lots of activities and fun things that you can do. You will play a lot before getting bored.\n- Money isn't just for buying weapons and ammo. Money can be used to upgrade skills, vehicles, buy and upgrade weapons, purchase buildings to increase the cash you get per hour.\n- INSANE ammount of customization. You can customize everything. EVERYTHING. From choosing how big you want your weiner to be, to even upgrading your crib.\n- Creating gangs. You can make and customize your gang. You can make ninjas with shotguns roam around the city. Come on, this is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.\n\nSingle-player itself is fun, but if you have one single friend YOU MUST play the Co-op. The game is even more amazing and ridiculously fun.\n\nJust a few and minor glitches such as sometimes getting into the car you dont want or when pressing "E" to enter a car, your character walks really slowly to the car (which might result in death, as you might be in a hurry to escape the police).\n\nDispite all these minor bugs, this game is one of my favorite games ever.\n\nFinal Rating: FULL 10 / 10\nThe price tag is worth it for what you are going to get out of this game. About 16-20 hours of the main storyline and double or even triple more for exploring and doing other fun activities.\n","May 19, 2014","true","31.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.\n2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.\n3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.\n4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed\n5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.\n6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.","March 7, 2015","true","142.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Gangs, driving around and doing random stuff didn't appeal to me.  Apparently, I've been missing out on all the fun.\n\nSome things that I liked:Comedy - This game has a lot of silliness and it's aware of it.  There are some serious moments but most of the game is just so over the top that it's ridiculous (in a good way).  Most of the funny stuff were intentional, but there were some funny stuff that just happened in the course of playing the game.  For example, I was doing an escort mission, and while the clients are doing some uh... weird noises, the Hallelujah Chorus started playing on the car radio.  There were other random funny stuff that happened, but that was one of the most memorable.\nVoice acting - So far, I've only used female1 voice.  I don't know if the other voices are as good.\nCharacter customization - In addition to the standard head customization, you can also customize the body and choose the voice of your character.  I couldn't make a decent custom face if my life depended on it, but I was happy with the body customization.  You can customize your character at any time during the game.\nClothing options - This is a source of my annoyance in most games that allow you to change the clothes/armor of your character.  In this game, any piece of clothing can be worn by either male or female character.  There's no stupid "normal version for male characters and ridiculous-looking version for female characters".  The clothes are normal or ridiculous, regardless of who's wearing them (in general, not talking about cross-dressing).  I guess the "I want more sexy" crowd and the "I want reasonable-looking clothes" crowd are both happy.\nDriving - I'm not a huge fan of driving games, but I enjoyed driving in this one.  Driving at top speed while being chased by the police or rival gangs with classical music playing on the radio was fun.\nNot really complaints, but things that I found meh:Weapon customization - There's no weapon customization.\nCheckpoint system (missions) - I like being able to save anywhere and continue exactly from where I left off.  I don't know if it was done that way (checkpoint system) because it's a console port or for some other technical reasons.","December 7, 2014","true","135.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Now you Have only TOP)\n-The New gangs feel stupid, lacking any uniqueness like the ones found in Saints Row 2.\n-THERE IS NO ♥♥♥♥ING REGGAE!!!\n-The side activities have absolutely no context, you enter a side mission, and you instantly start it, no context, no reasons, no nothing.\n-The cool side activites like Fight Club, Septic Avenger, and Crowd Control have been replaced with dull activities like Tank Mayhem and Proffessor Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax.\n-There are less celebrity cameos now, part of which is caused by the lack of Crowd control.\n-The Saints are no longer a gang, now they have been turned into stupid celebrities who advertise energy drinks, instead of the badass gangsters they used to be.\n-Also, Every Saint is less likeable than Before- Gat gets killed off  for no reason, Pierce dresses like ♥♥♥♥, My Fav Saint Shaundi is no longer a cute Dready pothead who loves to chill, smoke Loa dust, party, and ♥♥♥♥ed everyone in Stilwater, NO. Now she is a stupid hispanic looking ♥♥♥♥♥ who wears tight clothes, and hates everyone and everything, FOR NO REASON.\n-It has unesesary useless animations for when you're knocked down, every time you get knocked down, you have to wait for this unskippable animation of you getting up, during which you can actually get knocked back again and again.\n-The Pedestrians are repetitive and boring, you no longer have Soccer Moms, Rednecks, Elderly, Richies, Bums, Patriots, Street Performers, or Gangsters. Everyone in Steelport is either a Hipster, Hooker/Stripper, Bum, or a Guido.\n-There is no Multiplayer, only this stupid thing called ♥♥♥♥♥D mode.\n\nI do not recommend this game to fans of the classics.\n\nIts a real shame, I hear tons of Saints Row starters who say that they love the series but that this was their first game. Please, Play Saints Row 1 or 2 First, you won´t be dissapointed.","June 17, 2015","false","22.0"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","19","36","0","4"

In saint rows II the steering was two sharp, but now its not too bad. Its very humourous, you get to smack people with a baseball bat/d1ldo. It can't get better than that. Although, it gets very repetitive and sometimes it tends to crash when you shift + tab, maybes its just me. In addition, it began crashing during the first few times i played the game, i had to do some research to solve the problem, it was a simple and easy, but time consuming problem. Overall, I really liked how the game turned out and how they gave you the option to chose what you wanted to do in certain parts of the game. If i had to rate this game out of ten, i would give it 8/10. Its not good or bad.","May 12, 2014","true","65.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/55230/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nSaints Row: The Third takes you out of Stilwater, the city where the action took place in the previous titles, and drops you into the new city of Steelport, where it is your job to take over and show everyone that the Saints are made to rule. There is little story to uncover here and even that can probably be resumed in a sentence or two, but the most important aspect of your purpose in Saints Row: The Third is that you have been put there to kick ♥♥♥, and not just anyhow, but in style. The story is only meant to introduce you to the characters and the mechanics of the game, giving you access to the tools, vehicles and weapons that you master later on in the game to use how you see fit. While the plot does give a little of background to each one of the three gangs in Steelport: The Morningstar, The Deckers and The Luchadores, most of the missions will be all about the unique ways in which they manage to entertain you, and less about the actual reason for why you just blew up an entire building. While Saints Row: The Third barely tells you anything about the community of Steelport and even the gangs themselves, it does tell you a lot about the Saints, and even if you haven't touched a Saints Row game before, it will almost instantly grow with you and transform you into a fan of the Saints just by being a part of an explosive and unscripted way of life. While some will remain with you longer than others, all characters have something of their own, from a pimp that only speaks using autotune, to a friend that makes you drive around while sitting next to a tiger, Saints Row: The Third is above all, a moshpit of craziness. To understand the logic behind this game you must not take it seriously, because it is not meant to be that at all; instead Saints Row III provides you with the same gang fighting scenery as its predecessors in a city that serves as your playground, filled with crazy characters, vehicles and missions to satisfy your thirst for endless destruction.\nRating: 7\n\nGameplay\nIf there's one thing Saints Row: The Third does well that is variety; aside from the campaign missions which will take on all sorts of crazy and explosive adventures, there are numerous other activities such as Escort, Mayhem, Snatch, Guardian Angel, Professor Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax and many more other activities and challenges including Car Theft Missions and Assassination Contracts. Everything that you do in Saints Row: The Third will earn you cash and respect, which can be used to unlock and respectively buy upgrades and powers not only for your character, but for your crew and your strongholds as well. There is quite an impressive inventory of cars and aircrafts that you can play around with, and spending more time in Saints Row: The Third while advancing the game will only unlock more toys for you to play with, including an insane retro-game tank. This game wants to make one thing clear, and that is that the Saints are here to take over, and while the game doesn't offer a struggling story to get there, it does offer insane and pure fun in every single moment down the road, starting with a character working with a couple of Saints from a small apartment in the beginning, only to have the entire Steelport as your playground by the end of the game, leaving you free to use all the tools and weapons at your disposal in which way you best see fit. The campaign can also be played cooperatively, and aside from the missions themselves, you are free to roam around the city of Steelport with a friend, trying out new things and leaving aside any preconceived notions of multiplayer games for some good entertainment in which you will set your own objectives and goals in the heat of the moment. As fun as it is, the game doesn't come without its problems, as there are numerous glitches and sometimes mission freezes that will require you to reload the last checkpoint in order to continue, and while those appear way more often in multiplayer for some reason, you will still encounter some of those while playing alone as well.\nRating: 7.5\n\nGraphics\nWhile it isn't the prettiest game of its time, Saints Row: The Third does a decent job keeping up with the times, and even though it doesn't have anything that will shine out of the ordinary, the city of Steelport feels like a great playground for all the toys you'll get to try out in the game. The character models aren't the shiniest ones either, but the fact that you can customize your own character with almost almost any piece of clothing you can think of and even add tattoos makes up for it. The visual effects can feel repetitive at times, as explosions will most likely look the same no matter the objects or environment; there are also numerous weird animations that can be hard to ignore and occasional visual glitches.\nRating: 7\n\nAudio\nFrom electronic to rap, 80's pop hits and even classics such as Bach, Saints Row: The Third has something for everyone when it comes to its soundtrack, and thanks to its customizable playlist it is up to you to create your own tunes mix to accompany you along the road. The voice cast is quite impressive, with Troy Baker providing the default player voice, while Danielle Nicolet gets to voice Shaundi and Hulk Hogan providing the voice of Angel de la Muerte. They even had Sasha Grey from you know where voice brothel owner Viola DeWynter and Burt Reynolds voice himself in the game as Mayor Burt Reynolds. The sound effects are top notch and fit the action on screen perfectly and even when the visuals disappoint for a moment, there's always good audio to make up for it.\nRating: 10\n\nExtras\nThe main campaign can be finished within 10 hours, but you can easily spend 20 more completing activities, challenges and looking for collectibles; the story itself is only an introduction to what you can expect from Saints Row: The Third, and with all the tools and weapons it has to offer the possibilities are practically endless. The entire game can also be played cooperatively which is always a great reason to jump back into the game and complete whatever you missed the first time alongside one of your buddies while trying out new things and basically having a good time.\nRating: 10\n\nVerdict\nSaints Row: The Third is above anything else an endless source of entertainment, whether you choose to play alone or with a buddy, as there is an enormous amount of activities, missions, challenges, weapons, vehicles, tools, gang fights, proprieties to buy and upgrades to unlock, ensuring that no matter what, there will always be something fun and refreshing to do in the city of Steelport as long as there will be Saints in it.\nRating Overall: 8.3\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Saints Row: The Third at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=318","January 14, 2015","true","57.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's similar in many ways to the game it wants to be, GTA, from its tired pop-culture references and over the top satire to its exaggerated violence.\n\nIt starts badly with a muddled opening couple of missions that throw you right into the action with little reasoning behind it. However after the confusing and bloated start it soon settles down into familiar open-city sandbox game play. Numerous side missions and shops are dotted around the fairly large city of Steelport with story missions available at any time. It's this freedom and sheer quantity of activities available that's the games success. From driving around with a tiger in the passenger seat to car surfing it throws a wide variety of things to do. As there is so much to do it can at times turn into a grind fest as you tick off one of the many fun but meaningless activities and challenges.\n\nThe biggest weakness then is the plot, characters and setting. The city itself is bland with forgettable locations in a non-descript North American cityscape and unlike games like GTA or Mafia each part of Steelport feels much the same as the next. The characters don’t help make it anymore interesting as even as cartoon cut-outs they are bland as they work their way through the humourless story. It feels like it's trying too hard to be a funny spoof much the same way the GTA series over-eggs its satire. Comedy shouldn't need to be forced.\n\nThere is a wide range of vehicles available, from numerous bikes, cars, planes and boats, however they all seem to handle roughly the same apart from the speed and often feel weightless as you turn on a pin in even the most worthless of vehicles or as you smash through other vehicles and the environment. Combat is much the same, waves of enemies with no weight; they are much like the blow up dolls you can find dotted around the city.\n\nHaving said all of that I still had great fun with it, more for side missions, challenges and free-roaming than for it's story but I have a feeling that's the point.","September 6, 2013","true","38.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wanted a game that had characters you could customize and that you could explore and play at your own pace. Saints Row: The Third was highly recommended everywhere I looked so I decided to take a chance on it.\n\nAnd I am really glad that I did. I have never enjoyed a game so much. The storyline was just engaging. I did not expect it to be as crazy as it was but I have to say, I liked it. Going from jumping out of planes  to running naked and drugged through a BDSM club was more entertaining than I could have ever imagined. I found myself actually wanting to play the storyline instead of doing all the side quests first. I wanted to know what happened.\n\nThe characters themselves had great voice actors and the dialogue was spot on. It's hard not to get attached to them and actually want to protect them (even when they're being annoying little jerks and dying all the time). You can pick a voice for your character and though much of the dialogue stays the same no matter which voice you picks, each one still manages to have its own personality seperate from the others. The voice I picked, clearly had a thing for Pierce and alluded to it several times in the story. Little things like that are what make this game great.\n\nIt is a little bit laggy at times and there is one challenge at the end of the first chapter that is completely screwed up on a lot of computers due to a missing cut scene but I managed to get around that by putting my resolution on low and it worked fine. I didn't think the controls for the keyboard or mouse were particularly tricky and I'm someone with terrible hand-eye coordination so free cameras usually mess me up.\n\nAll in all, I loved it and am planning on playing it again.","May 28, 2014","true","94.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's things I like about it versus things that I absolutely despise and wish they didn't change. Though it's something that happens with every new SR game.\n\nThe combat was much improved in SR3 as was basically everything else about the gameplay. The game is really well polished and runs rather nicely with it's fancy PC port. However at the same time things were removed to reduce strain on the processor. Things like how there's no real timescale in the game, and it only shifts from day to night after doing missions/activities. Or how layered clothing was removed and replaced with more goofy customization options.\n\nAt the same time it's a game I still like to a certain extent. And one I respect Volition a whole lot for creating. Saints Row the Third is a game made by developers that took a lot of risks. Both broadening their base and shrinking it at the same time. Thankfully Volition is also creating mod tools for SR3, so hopefully my ♥♥♥♥♥ing will stop shortly thereafter.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=313258182","August 11, 2013","true","130.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

W grze tworzymy własnego bahatera lub bohaterkę w rozbudowanym kreatorze w którym możemy bardzo dłuuugo przesiedzieć. Wszystko się zaczyna od nieudanego napadu na bank gdzie po włączeniu alarmu przerz... kurna zapomniałem jak się on nazywał :P gościa napadają na nas fale antyterrorystów wraz z helikopterami. Po dokonaniu sporej rozwałki zostajemy złapani i trafiamy do pierdla z którego po chwili wykupuje nas gang. I znów zaczyna się rozwałka ale tym razem w samolocie. Gdy ewakuujemy się z samolotu słyszymy ,że Johnny Gat został złapany i tak zaczynają się problemy świętych z ulicy w poszukiwaniu Gata oraz wojną z innymi gangami. Teraz trochę o modyfikacjach oraz sandboksie. Mamy bardzo duuużo urozmaiceń w tym ulepszanie gangu, broni, kupowanie ciuchów, tuningowanie samochodów :3 oraz wiele innych.\nBroń możemy ulepszać dokupując większy magazynek z celownikiem optycznym, dodatkową lufę do strzelby, granatnik itp. Jest również sławna broń (Penetrator) która jest połączeniem dilda z kijem bejsbolowym. Pojazdów jest sporo i prawie każdy możemy stuningować dodając lepsze osiągi, montując ładniejsze zderzaki, spoilery, końcówki wydechów, maski, naklejki, alufelgi. Jazda samochodem w tej grze daje podobne uczucie szybkości jak w NFS co właśnie zachęca do tuningowania wozów.\nGrę oceniam na 8+/10 za bardzo dużą sandboksowość oraz często zaistą akcję np: walka z dziwkami zabójczyniami, rozpierdzielanie ulic czołgiem, rzucanie się pod samochody w celu dostania odszkodowania :D. Chociaż samochody mają za lekką masę i jak się robnię potrafią latać. Przy słabej broni trzeba wypakować pół magazynka we wroga co jest denerwujące.

You will have to fight both gangs and cops. The city sometimes becomes a real war zone with SWAT team rushing into an interesction full speed with their armored truck, cops choppers firing on hostiles, you defending your crib that has been attacked by a gang, the laters bringing their homies with them. Being in middle of all this mess is eerie. You won't survive with another game mechanisms. So, grab your smartphone and call your crib, your favorites homies and increase the chaos in that intersection even more. Can't seem to protect your crib? Too many people running around and shooting everywhere? Okay, call for an airstrike. Missiles will rain down that poor intersection anihilating everything.\n\nIt's a lotta fun, really. You will always find something to do in that city. There are many side missions that get unlocked when progressing into the main story. Doing those mission will increase your influence aera and spawn homies in the street that you can call in case of emergency. Also, your hourly money benefits will increase the more area you got and the more businesses and houses you buy.\n\nAnd best of all, you can play the whole game in coop with a friend. How awesome is that uh?\nHOW AWESOME IS THAT? While you drive, your homie is mowing down he street; while you take cover he throws nades on hostiles; while you run naked in them streets your bro is covering your tight äss  with a molusk launcher. Yeah you heard me. A MOLUSK LAUNCHER THAT CAN MIND CONTROL PEOPLE!!\n\nNow you oughta get it: Saints Row is uber fun and crazy. Even the cutscenes sometimes go like: "Isn't there an easier way to get into that plane?" she asks. You just raise your brows and say "Without a doubt honey.".\n\nThere are many more features this game provides, so many I just can't enumerate them here in this review.

I, being a fan of more serious games like Arma and Half Life(2), was origionally skeptical about this game.  However, watching the (many) videos of Saints Row III I grew to like it.  RPGs were nearly my least favorite genre of games until I played this, in which I have gotten many different RPGs, such as Fallout.  Saints Row III combines Story, Co-Op, and Character Customization in a way that makes it semi-unique.  Don't like the way your character looks?  Don't try to download a mod, just pay a (rather costly) visit to the nearest plastic surgeon to change any features you might've not liked.  The Drop-In, Drop-Out Co-Op also works decently well, with a little lag on either side (sides being the players, of course).  Finally, the thing I like most about Saints Row III? The customization.  No, not Character Customization!  Car Customization.  Car finatics will like this game a lot, with (semi) realistic car handling.  There's even a choice to get cheaper car parts in customiziation in one of the (missions) in the Story.\n\nAll in all, a great game.  Don't let the mature-ish humor get in your way of your decision.  This game is worth every second of it, in my opinion.  If I had to, I would give this game a 95/ 100, because of thesomewhat inappropriate humor.","October 6, 2014","true","112.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In one of the missions, you had to fight your way out of a transport plane, which dropped things all over the sky, so you dodge stuff while you skydive, AND shoot skydivers chasing you, so you can rescue your girl (who jumped without a chute). Then when the transport tries to ram you, you shoot yourself into the cockpit (from the outside!), dive through, shoot your way through the plane AGAIN, dive out the back, and go after your girl... AGAIN. Yes, that's how silly this game is. Without the silliness, this is just a GTA style game where you get a sandbox to play in. There's a plot, and a couple major branching missions, but it's pretty silly, and it's all about playing in the costume and vehicles you want. If you like your shooters to be silly (a baseball club that's attached to a... huge ♥♥♥♥♥, for example), then SR3 is right up your alley.","January 8, 2013","true","82.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was probably the biggest selling point for me. The sheer number of hairstyles, outfits, and costumes for characters was really fantastic for anyone who values character creation/customization. Vehicle customization is also incredible and almost every vehicle has many mods that can be applied to it, not to mention the multitude of colors and wheels that can be applied.\n\n~Ridiculous gameplay. Not as "out-there" as SR IV, but it had its silly moments. I never had a boring experience in this game, save for some of the early missions which are based on activities. By the end of the game, you can unlock damage negation to just about everything except for melee weapons (for whatever reason), unlimitied sprint, boost for all cars, all of which make the gameplay more about just having fun.\n\n~Infinite replay value. Like most open world games, it's hard to run out of things to do. In the immediate post-story game you can complete any and all activities that you haven't already, you can purchase all stores for additional income, there are DLCs that can be completed at any time, and there are some optional side missions to keep you entertained. In the long-run, once everything you can possibly do is done, you can still resort to doing whatever the hell you want because it's Saints Row and its just pure fun.\n\nCONS:\n~Multiplayer with lesser computers. Saints Row was built for consoles, there's no denying that, and because of that, the way multiplayer syncs up with your partner is through framerate. That means if I'm running it at 60fps, and my friend is running it at 10fps (because their computer is garbage) then your characters are going to warp around because the game can't sync. This was never a problem for me because I never played with that person, but if your computer is low-tier, I would stay away from multiplayer.\n\n~Pierce. Pierce is in this game and I kept waiting for a mission where I could choose whether or not he can continue his existence. There was no mission to kill Pierce. Fortunately, you can *SPOILER* sell-out Birk.\n\nTL;DR:\nI don't think I have ever had this much fun with a game. In terms of fun and rewarding gameplay, story missions that didn't get old, and laughs from the excellent writing and zany gameplay, it has not disappointed me.\n\n9.9/10\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nBuy this game, I honestly had more fun with it than Saints Row IV because vehicles and weapons still have purpose in this one.","December 14, 2014","true","48.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Subtle, consistent, puzzling and careful - these are what this game is not. If you want unrepentant ridiculous fun and carnage with a solid plotline this is for you, and even if you don't want that you should still play this game. The writing is some of the best I've ever come across in a game, and the dialogue easily had me cracking up while still invested in the characters - and when you finish the game and realise you've ran out of content there's always saints row 4 to pick up where you left off.\n\nIt's difficult to articulate what exactly makes this so much fun, but between how you meet your homies, playing at Genkibowl and running around the entire city naked with a baseball bat beating up cops and robbers alike it wont take you long to realise for yourself.

Dont be expecting a similar game to Grand Theft Auto though because Saints Row The Third takes a different approach. This game is both humorous and serious at times. The graphics are decent and adds a little hip with the character customiziation. The story is fairly nice but i found it to be a little short in gameplay. One thing i like about this game and which sets it apart from the previous Saints Row (Saints Row 2) is the ability to chose the outcome of certain situations. I give this game a 9/10 for its overall score.","August 3, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game comes cheap and is very fun for the short time that you play it.\n\nwhat made this game for me like was the comdy as it never failled to make me laugh but apart from that i feel as if it really did lack in content.\n\ni would recomend this game it gives about 30 hours of playing time and can really give you a kick with the gangster like comdy.  6/10","August 4, 2014","true","26.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For keeps. And it has tanks that---while encumbered with godawful controls---actually physically crush vehicles under them, which is glorious. And VTOLs with flappy bits. And a bit in cyberspace.
