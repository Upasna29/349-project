I cannot believe that I've just paid 3 dollars to see some sockets and plugs having sex - and some other really bizarre displays - but as a matter of fact, I'm not regretful. As far as "art" goes, this was one of my better experiences in Steam.\n\nPlug & Play is a 10 minute interactive animation rather than a game. You basically go through some very basic interactions to make the animation function, lose 10 minutes from your life and carry on. The game even carries the courtesy of warning you that expected gameplay isn't longer than 15 minutes in its store page. What is the animation about? Well, that is the part that got to do something with "art", thus a verdict would be very subjective.\n\nIn my humble opinion, Plug & Play opens its curtains to an everymen Joe, symbolized by a bipedal figure with a plug instead of a head. We watch him running, hopping, searching and trying to interact with an everywomen Jane - who is the same bipedal figure with a socket instead of a head - fail to communicate, indulge in meaningless sexual connections and start over again - this time more stoic and stern, rather than hopeful. This game - or rather animation is a short contemplation on modern day society and how each genders end up using each other to fill a sensual void reflexively. We endlessly search for an actual connection, yet keep hurting each other in our search relentlessly. This is a very short, very sharp and dark approach on human nature.\n\nDoes it worth your 3 dollars? Well, I wouldn't know. As I said, I'm not regretful. If this wouldn't be on Steam, I'd never discover it probably. If you are curious, but do not feel like paying for this, you can always watch the original animation here. The game is the interactive version of this original short animation anyway. 10 minutes lost, a grim perspective reminded: I carry on. Good day to everyone and good luck on your own search!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 198 of 230 people (86%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","86","198","230","32","4"

It feels really weird to watch it but in it's own way it gets your interest. It lets you think of human relationships via grotesque plug characters.\n\nThe video itself is already available for free on Vimeo, so you can check it there if you'd rather spend your money somewhere else.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/recommended/353560/","slothyexistence","The Slothful Existentialist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/","953 products in account","Overview:Plug & Play is an Indie point-and-click adventure game developed by Swiss Mario von Rickenbach and Michael Frei, who coded and drew/animated it respectively; it is published by Etter Studio. It is based on the short film by the same name, created by Michael Frei. It's available on Steam, the App Store and Google Play Store. It has received various awards as a game and as a short film. The game is a casual, comical, and seemingly not too serious title. Nevertheless, it does have high levels of philosophical implications and symbolic imagery that may not be -and are most likely not- noticed by most people who play the game. The short film version conveys the core message in a much more direct way. It is an artistic expression. This game is about the human condition.\n\n\nStory:The game has a very ambiguous and vague way of telling its story. At first glance it is a slightly vulgar game that has much apparent sexual innuendo, phallic and yonic symbols are also ever-present in the game and play an underlying, much more profound role than what they may represent at first sight.\n\nA ‚Äòplugman‚Äô connects and disconnects with other ‚Äòplugmen‚Äô. They run, hit, get hit, touch, pull, push and converse with one another. You will laugh throughout all of this, since it‚Äôs an unexpectedly hilarious experience.\n\n\nGameplay:There‚Äôs not much to the gameplay, you click and drag objects and ‚Äòplugmen‚Äô, and hit switches which turn lights on and off.\n\nDesign-wise it expects you to get out of your comfort zone. Yes, it‚Äôs a fairly linear game, but there are parts of it that require you to try different things out, and the game doesn‚Äôt necessarily spell those things out for you.\n\n\nVisual:It‚Äôs a significantly minimalist game. All there is are drawn characters, hands, and objects such as light switches, electrical plugs, cables that plug in, and cables that get plugged into.\n\nThe ‚Äòplugmen‚Äô are actually very well animated, it‚Äôs one of the first things I noticed and appreciated about the game. Animations are very comical and don‚Äôt take themselves too seriously, but are very fluid.\n\n\nSound:Most of the game is silent, unless you‚Äôre interacting with something or watching a sequence happen, and those sounds have a fairly high quality.\n\nThe beginning of the game has a choir singing, and it was actually a very pleasant choir, it gave the game a sense of duality. What I mean by duality is that the game seems so casual, not serious at all at first glance, and the choir gives it a kind of dramatic alien atmosphere that does feel very serious. I believe this is because the undisclosed themes that you have to read into -such as heartbreak, insecurity, and generally connecting with people- are actually very serious and very relatable to people as human beings.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts: When I first saw the game on my activity feed, I surely didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd end up writing a review for it; I was simply intrigued by its ‚Äúwhat-the-f***edness‚Äù. The first time I played it I laughed harder than I have in a while, and the second time I played it I almost teared up. I had to play the game twice to really understand the themes that it experiments with. Once I did understand I related to the game on an emotional level. I enjoyed it and found it almost cathartic by the end of my second playthrough, which led me to write this review.\n\nThis is very much a work of art in its own right, a manifestation of self-expression. The biggest theme (the way I see it) is human connection, that‚Äôs the whole point of the game in my opinion. The theme of human connection serves as an umbrella for several other themes. Themes of love, relationships, friendships, insecurity, indecisiveness, trust, heartbreak, and mostly behaviors towards and from other people. All of these things affect us as people, as human beings; this manifests everyday when we wake up in the morning and turn on the light. and when we turn the light off to go to sleep at night. This game is about the human condition.\n\nBonusIf you think you might like the short yet enlightening experience of playing this game but are doubtful, watch my playthrough and decide. Either way, I do believe experiencing it first-hand is much more special than watching someone else go through it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNE3aJbl8o0\nIf you‚Äôre interested in the short film that this game is based on, click here.\nFor more information, click here.[plugplay.ch]","May 8","true","0.4"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","30","33","2","6"

To attempt to give a proper synopsis to this title and it's "deeper meanings" is impossible, but, in short, you plug and you play. It's "story" is split into 6 parts, each one lasting from 2-3 minutes, making for a very short game overall. Because of this, I can't recommend it for it's base price of 2.99 on Steam; However, for those of you who enjoy delving into the metaphorical, interpretive side of gaming, as a sort of artform, you may find a quick fix through this title. It's a strange, relatively short play, but if you can find it for cheap (or free), I recommend a playthrough for a quick laugh and maybe even a little introspect.\n\nRating:  5.5/10","June 20, 2015","true","0.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

As such, I took quite a while to actually pick it up to play.\n\nWhen I did, I got really happy that I got it. The game, despite short, is incredibly well-written, and due to its abstractness, can be interpreted in a lot of ways.\n\nWhile I was playing, I started thinking the game as how social interactions work, and that's pretty much what the game tries to convey. How life can be a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• sometimes, but you just have to find a way through to find your own happiness.\n\nSucks that I'll never be able to experience the 15 minutes I spent on this game the same way ever again.

I got 15 minutes of "gameplay" out of it, and that amounted to mostly clicking around until something triggered the next action. Essentially there are some plugs, outlets, hands, fingers, and people with plugs and outlets for heads. You can drag them around and combine them, but it's not like a puzzle game or anything like that. You usually only have one obvious thing to do. I got maybe one half-chuckle out of it, and it's not profound or anything like that. For three dollars it's an utter rip-off. It *might* be worth it for like 49 cents.

If I didn't know it's a short interactive film I could not completed it. And I like, I love, philosophical things.\n\nBut this one isn't really philosophical. It doesn't hold much meaning. Yea, I know, thinking outside the box. I know that creators of this short tried to do this, but for me it's just over the top, with no meaning. And the mouse movement is so sluggish and awful.\n\nThis "game" is trying to play with the "player" but in poor sense - giving random ideas the creators had, in short, random, and interrupted sequences, trying to shock "player".\n\nI got this from the bundle, and I don't really know why it have such positive reviews.

You can watch it as an animated short on Vimeo for free or buy it here on Steam with some added interactivity.\n\nFor me it felt easier to buy a game to add to my library than donating for a streamed video so kudos to the devs for succeeding in finding a alternative way to finance the project.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth experiencing in any form and should be a given item in the library of anyone interested in interactive art.","January 6","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Plug & play was a truly weird but mesmerizing experience.\n\nTo review Plug & Play properly would be to destroy the entire experience for anyone willing to play it. What I will say is that it is an interactive film in which you view strange imagery that all in all probably has a much deeper meaning. It really is a game that will have you thinking wtf the whole way through but I somehow thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nI really wish I could offer an in depth review of this game but really all it is a 20 minute experience. I would really recommend anyone to try Plug & Play and see if you'll be as mesmerized as I was, and still am!","January 7","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The major gripes lots of people reviewing it seem to have are that it's too short for the price and that the interactive element felt tacked on and they'd rather just watch the animation, though I'm kind of happy paying 99p for an interesting 10-ish minute animation (that's literally cheaper than a coffee), and I think I probably would have been less invested had I just watched the animation play.\n\nUltimately, if you're not really into weird little art pieces you probably shouldn't buy this and I probably wouldn't pay the full ¬£1.99 for it, but if it's on sale I say give it a gander.","October 7, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I mean, I *do* know. But... not so completely/exactly/precisely as I'd like.\n\nThis is a very nice little odd thing. I've only played it once and it's quite short, but I feel like going back to it a couple of times, if only to watch the excellent animation style again.\n\nDespite being quite explicit at times (within the confines of its basic metaphor), it manages to be sweet and bittersweet. Looks a bit heteronormative at first, but if it really is so it's with a sadness for it. The music and the sound in general do wonders for that overall feeling of not really understanding what's going on in situations that should be really very simple.\n\nAnd that's a feeling one gets a lot in those parts of life when sex (and, consequently, emotions) are involved.\n\nWell done.","October 8, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's no traditional story telling here as it's all random sequences which make up the entire game.\n\nThe gameplay consists of dragging and clicking the entire time. The entire game's goal is to plug something in or plug something out.\n\nThe art style is weird looking and it just creeps you out at first and then it weird's you out, how strange the game becomes in a short amount of time.\n\nThe game is also incredibly short. It took me 10 minutes to finish the entire game and after you finish the game the first time, there's no replay value what so ever, so keep that in mind if you're planning on buying this game.\n\nIn the end, there's not much to say about the game apart from what I already said.  Plug and Play is a great little art title and I highly suggest you check it out, but only on a discount since I recommend spending 3 euros for 10 minutes of content. I do suggest getting it on a discount though and you will not be disappointed.\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10 Wait for a discount\n\nIf you liked the review please give it a thumbs up and if you disliked, post in the comments and let me know what you disliked.","October 10, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Over the course of around 15 minutes, you will see plugs do all sorts of... things... Some of these things you may have been better off just not seeing.\n\nThe animation and sounds are pretty well done in Plug & Play. I do feel the price is a little too high considering the length (even though, yes, they do state the length of the game right on the store page). There are also some points where you may need a seizure warning (flashing back and forth between white and black). It also did feel a bit odd to control at times,with some odd responsiveness when you were on the "human" shaped plugs.\n\nPlug & Play is one of those games that I wish there was a neutral option for reviews.

I bought it because I do enjoy oddball stuff and it had a great rating and was cheap. I didn't read into it that much but now that i played it and feel like I wasted money (not much, granted, but it's money i could have spent on a better game, some ice cream, or a box of cheap tampons, all of which i would have enjoyed more than this game.) I'm happy for the hipster artfag bunch that felt validated after completing this game but I'd love for this to exist elsewhere instead of Steam.

I essentially got this game for nothing and quite frankly I am relieved. If I had paid money on this I would feel much worse as it by no means merits any money being spent on it. All in all the 'game' took me 19 minutes. There is absoultely no explanation as to what is happening. If it is trying to make a point I cant see it. I dont know if it meant to but its seems to be slightly sexual which to me just comes off as very perculiar. I guess its trying to be artsy and leaves me to make my own conclusion and pull my own meaning out of the mess that enfolds infront of me. If I were to link games dierectly to art this would definitely fall under modern art. The ones where everyone group rounds and one person says something really profound and to avoid sounding stupid everyone agrees, though essentially there staring at something ridiculous like a coffee stain or a messy desk. Don't waste your time on it.

Having played the original game and watched the original animation, I feel that this game did not add anything that may worth 3 dollar. It misses the point of why it made as a game instead of just an animation. Playing this game evokes the same feeling as watching the animation. There is limited sense of agency for the player, often I feel like I have to do the same thing as the original animation does to progress the game. Play time feels really short, but it was advertised on the store description, so buyers beware.\n\nOn the other hand the animation is really done great, and it feels so great to touch and move things. And it should be, given the original creator is an animator and this game was originally created for mobile device.\n\nI suggest to buy this game if you really want to support the creators or really bored and had spare 3 dollars, otherwise just watch the original animation.","December 29, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaphite/recommended/353560/","zaphite","Zaphite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaphite/","486 products in account","Plug and Play is an interacive video with some interesting visuals and ideas but fails to impress with its limited amount of player involvement and extremely short run time.\n\nThe Good\nPlug and Play is a simple game with hand-drawn style graphics and a minimalistic approach to conveying ideas, which it does do quite well. The actions that take place during the game can be metaphors for many aspects of life, such as love, jealousy, and death. These themes are conveyed in the simple graphics mentioned before, which is commendable as it manages to make you think about serious topics with visials that very loosely represent the things they could refer to.\n\nThe Bad\nAlthough the game allows for deeper thought into its meaning, it was personally very forgetable. This is due mostly to the run time, which was only approximately 10 minutes. The game was over when I was just starting to think about any kind of story or meaning. Some may say that this means the game is a good length as it is just long enough to provoke deeper thought, but even if you believe that to be true, charging $2.99 seems overpriced for a game that could have been experienced almost the same as if it were a video. The only interaction you have is to click or pull certain items or options when promted. There is no replayability and no way to lose.\n\nAlthough Plug and Play is an interesting experience, it is too short and without enough interactive elements to justify charging almost $3. While writiing this review, I actually found the video online which the game was adapted from, a 6 minute story featuring almost exactly the same scenes and ideas that the game had, but at no cost. The little interaction the game did have helped provoke me to think about its deeper meanings, but not enough for me to reccomend purchasing this game over watching the free video.","January 27","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You were built from plugs and your finger came off just to be plugged in, and to be turend on and off by the game's ending.

In order for humanity to be in a state of being, we must connect with each other, like the plugs you see in the game. I put humans in this analysis because the plugs in the game have the bodies and hands of human beings. We humans are like those plugs in the game in a way that in order for humanity to progress, be fruitful and multiply, is to use our special plugs, which is the male and female sex organs (considering my gayness, anyway, continuing). Males are the plug, while the female is the socket. That is why when you were playing this game, things did not seem to go through the next step unless you unplug and then plugged all the sockets. Socially, humans lives their lives where there are followers and leaders (addressing the plugs being plugged behind each other's butts), which is another human connection. Psychologically as well as sexually, the human body is not functional unless it has the brain (plug) connected to the spinal cord (socket). The world in general is full of plugs and sockets that can only be useful and functional if pulled close together. Life cannot be played out if not plugged in, hence, plug and play\n\n10/10 would waste 2 hours thinking about this again\n","March 17, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You were built from plugs and your finger came off just to be plugged in, and to be turend on and off by the game's ending.

The only thing you had to figure out was how to /progress/ the "story".  The images are kinda disturbing if you're not that into surreal stuff, but I think it mostly speaks of connecting with other people and in this game it was presented literally.\n\nDefinitely for people who like to go "What the f*** did I just see?" before trying to process a deeper meaning behind everything.","December 27, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The actions that take place during the game can be metaphors for many aspects of life, such as love, jealousy, and death. These themes are conveyed in the simple graphics mentioned before, which is commendable as it manages to make you think about serious topics with visials that very loosely represent the things they could refer to.\n\nThe Bad\nAlthough the game allows for deeper thought into its meaning, it was personally very forgetable. This is due mostly to the run time, which was only approximately 10 minutes. The game was over when I was just starting to think about any kind of story or meaning. Some may say that this means the game is a good length as it is just long enough to provoke deeper thought, but even if you believe that to be true, charging $2.99 seems overpriced for a game that could have been experienced almost the same as if it were a video. The only interaction you have is to click or pull certain items or options when promted. There is no replayability and no way to lose.\n\nAlthough Plug and Play is an interesting experience, it is too short and without enough interactive elements to justify charging almost $3. While writiing this review, I actually found the video online which the game was adapted from, a 6 minute story featuring almost exactly the same scenes and ideas that the game had, but at no cost. The little interaction the game did have helped provoke me to think about its deeper meanings, but not enough for me to reccomend purchasing this game over watching the free video.","January 27","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
