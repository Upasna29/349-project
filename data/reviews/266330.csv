I stumbled upon it during the sale and it looked like a decent platformer.\nBeing a fan of the genre I decided to give it a go and I was not dissapointed. I was actually quite impressed.\n\nI'm very competitive so the leaderboard is a really nice feature. After being inspired by the video posted of a Time Attack on the first map I decided to give it a go myself and soon I would find myself battling it out versus one of the developers of the game.\n\nEven if the competitive aspect isn't your forte the game still has a lot to offer. It looks amazing, it controls well and the levels are really well made (and there's plenty of them!)\n\nIf you like platformers I can't imagine you'd be dissapointed with this game","February 10, 2014","true","98.1"," 66 of 80 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","66","80","0","0"

Clear time, fragments collected, and pauses used.\n- 3 worlds with many stages. The game is hard enough to make you spend a lot of time trying to beat it. (I spent an hour on a stage once...)\n- Lots of replayability for every stage due to built-in challenges for low clear time, fragments collected, minimal pauses used and leaderboards.\n- Physics are well done. Momentum needs to be manipulated as well. Tons of possibilities.\n- Multiple ways to complete stages.\n- In-game art/graphics are decent.\n- Animations are smooth.\n- Quick restarts, instant respawns.\n- Controller support (though I prefer KB/M on this game)\n- Sound effects are decent 3/5. They don't bother me.\n- Music never got annoying, I never felt like I had to turn off the music, even after many hours of playing.\n- Steam Card drops.\n- Has achievements (better than none)\n- No RNG. This is great news for speedrunners. (This would be an entertaining game to see speedruns of, it's like Super Meat Boy)\n- No bugs from what I've seen so far. (Aside from a tiny one with the restart dialogue popping up continuously if you spam the confirm button on keyboard or controller)\n- Some stages have cheese hidden in hard to reach places.\n\nCons:\n- Story is lacking, but is not absent.\n- The opening cutscene to a new game is not very good.\n- The game can't be minimized in windowed mode.\n- Configuration limited to resolution, VSync, fullscreen/windowed, and FXAA on/off. But you would likely not benefit from any more options than these on this game anyway.\nNot many cons, you see. Try it out.","April 17, 2014","true","34.8"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/266330/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A tough 2D puzzle-platformer that gets a lot harder along the way but is a little more focused on precision platforming and a bit less on tough puzzles.\n\nBoth keyboard & mouse and a controller work pretty well with this game with me using the keyboard & mouse a lot more often mainly for the frequent puzzle sections that come up where it helps with allowing me to be a little more precise on object placement thanks to the mouse controls. The controller works well for everything else.\n\nYou start off in a tutorial level which I don't think tells you everything you need to know so you'd have to do your own learning.\nThere are three worlds you go through with 17 levels each (I think) including one side scrolling shooter stage, a platforming stage where you go straight up on a pogo stick with the screen only fixated on going up, and a boss stage (plus one extra stage per world if you clear all levels in that world). The pogo stick and shooter stages are incredibly straightforward but weren't actually bad and I'd have wished that there were a wee bit more than just one of those stages per world.\nThe puzzle-platformer part the game consists of requires a bit more from the player as it actually takes a bit of thinking and somewhat precise controls & reflex to avoid constantly dying and restarting so you'd have to take advantage of its physics engine and just get decent at platforming in general. To be a bit more forgiving you'd be restarting from very frequent checkpoints available.\nI thought the puzzles themselves weren't all that unique or innovative or whatever and they're not incredibly difficult but they still require a bit of thought. I did find it kind of cool that you can solve many of the puzzles in more than just one way especially the puzzles that mix with the platforming. The Steam store page says it's a bit like Braid (though I hardly saw it at all) because practically all the puzzles in this game require a limited use per stage of you stopping time and moving objects around within a given area to progress to the end of the stage. The puzzles work for the most part until they get a bit more complicated. Because the puzzles also rely on physics, sliding and placing blocks around can get wonky. For [example] if you're trying to slide a block down a slot or space with the same shape as the block the block itself could wedge itself a bit and likely not even fall down. Or maybe as you're trying to insert a block into an equally shaped slot you could easily bump a corner and the block wouldn't fall down just because you were only a wee bit off in trying to insert the thing into the hole.[/example] I'm not sure if that's part of the difficulty where precision is required even in the puzzle sections.\n\nAs well as simply reaching the goal, each stage consists of three types of optional challenges available you can take separately whenever you want to test you out a bit further. There's the fragment challenge, pause challenge, and time challenge (with the exception of the shooter and pogo stick stages where they only just have the fragment and time challenges). The fragment challenge is just the "collect all the scattered items in the stage" deal typical of many other platformers. The pause challenge is where you're only allowed to use pause a certain amount of times or less than stated per stage. The time challenge is just simply a speed run challenge where you have to reach the end of the goal before the allotted time.\n\nGame ain't too bad I thought even if the concept of the game's theme revolving around mice were a bit off putting to me.\n\nSide-note: I noticed that many of the negative reviews's main points for this game are that it's too hard. Unless maybe it's the kind of hard where you have to remember something's there to prepare yourself beforehand or else even if you react fast enough you lose[kayin.moe] (or unfair) then I think that's a terrible reason especially since it's said on the store page that it's going to be a bit tough.","October 3, 2015","true","30.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

In order to stand out you need to do something different and do it well. Ethan: Meteor Hunter aims to mix the precision and difficulty of the Super Meatboys of the world with some old fashioned block/tile sliding puzzles (the things that used to drive us mad as kids and when you could never get the last piece in the right place).\n\nYou play a mouse named Ethan who needs to navigate a number of platform/puzzle levels while gathering chunks of meteor and eating cheese.  While it might not sound that original it certainly does things a bit differently. The platforming elements are handled in pretty much the same way as a Cloudberry Kingdom or Super Meatboy, that being that they require precision jumps and timing with constant traps and dangers ready to kill you instantly.\n\nEthan is more about precision than breakneck speed and your character handles differently than you may expect. Handling has changed a little from the PS3 game and there is a better flow to your movement. This allows for the more fluid run that the levels seem to be designed for. There are also numerous checkpoints to avoid having to repeat large sections and the improved handling does help to lower the frustration, however it is still a very difficult game.\n\nThe main gimmick is the ability to use telekinetic powers to move blocks around to create platforms and solve puzzles. This, for the most part, works really well and adds variety to the game. Sometimes you’ll be simply moving blocks around to get to the next area, while at others you’ll need to be in a constant flow of jumping and pausing to move blocks to block flames or traps as you pass by. It’s in sections like this that the game really comes to life and the creativity of the development team really shines through.\n\nLevels themselves are designed to the highest standard and just about every conceivable way of twisting the basic mechanics is brought to the table. This means the game is always throwing something new at you or asking you to think about how to use your skills and abilities to reach the next area.\n\nPlayers need to stay sharp as this is a tough game from the start. You will die and die often and it’s certainly the type of game to cause controller smashing. Most of the time this is due to the player but there are odd occasions where the controls will let you down (it is much less prevalent than the PS3 version though). There are also a few minor issues that add to frustration. The main one of these involves small cut scenes or animations, especially when fighting bosses. You really don’t need to see a five second animation sequence over and over every time you die and it can tarnish the experience at times.\n\nAnother minor irritation is the timing of some of the sequences. In areas where things drop from the ceiling or roll along it seems that, on occasion, they don’t start quickly enough. This means that after death you then have to wait a few seconds for the object to get moving before you start charging off as otherwise you end up in the wrong place at the wrong time and die again. These are all minor issues but in a game as difficult as this it does add to the frustration when you have to repeat a section a large number of times.\n\nOverall, Ethan: Meteor Hunter is a brash, inventive and challenging platformer. It has strong level design and a lot of imagination through its fifty or so levels. It certainly shows a lot of potential, the few minor issues with timing and controls seems to have been smoothed out somewhat since the PS3 release which creates a more enjoyable experience. For those looking for more platforming action this is another must have, just be prepared to smash a few pads on your way to conquering the game.\n\nOverall 8/10","June 29, 2014","true","1.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

As far as puzzles go, you can freeze time and rearrange some parts of the area you are in, but it is not too hard to figure out what you need to do and when you need to do it. The platformer part, on the other hand, is frustratingly hard, and you can't make it easier by being smart with the puzzles. After the first couple of levels, I can't even get from checkpoint to checkpoint without dying a million times, which simply prevents me from enjoying this game at all.\n\nOn the whole, I don't recommend the game for it's original price, especially if you'd buy it for the puzzles. If you like difficult platformers, you might like it though.\n\n","December 14, 2014","false","3.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/266330/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","When I first started playing this game, I found it to be just kind of mediocre, not that bad but not anything special and not worth recommending. But the cracks really started to show after extensive play... not 100% done with the game yet but I'm annoyed enough to write a negative review right now so woo~\n\nHmm what problem should I address first.\nHow about the slippery edges and dropped jumps? Yeah, any edge of a platform seems to not count as part of the platform for jumping's sake, so often you'll end up not jumping when you wanted to and, presumably, dying. This doesn't feel like my fault. It feels like an error in the game engine. Dropped jumps are even more noticeable on downhill slopes, where there always seems to be a high chance of jumping not working if you aren't sliding (which you don't always want to be doing).\nAnother major problem is the homing cannons, since, well, that's already a bad idea to begin with. Bad game. Bad, bad game. Often they're shoehorned into sections that don't need them, though, and the homing power is waaaaay way way too strong, leading to it often coming down to luck whether or not you can survive a section.\nThere's also a lot of slooow autoscrolling sections that go on way too long, yet require a few tight, easy-to-mess-up jumps such that you can get all the way to the end of the section, screw up, and have to restart it. And some sections go on waaay too long. A lot of the levels are good about keeping decent checkpoint placement and level length but there are also plenty of exceptions.\nThe physics also seem somewhat inconsistent, to the point where there are more than a few cases where a puzzle solution working correctly comes down mostly to luck. Not horribly inconsistent, and there aren't a lot of puzzles that have this issue; mostly any puzzles involving rolling objects.\nThe overall pacing of the game is a bit wonky too. The higher-speed platforming doesn't mix with the puzzles well so the end result is a platformer that occasionally slows gameplay to a halt with a sliding block puzzle or a tedious autoscroll puzzle. The puzzle and platformer elements often exist in entirely separate universes, mostly. It's not a blend of the two genres, it just does them both at diferent times. There are instances of high-speed puzzle platforming that tends to be the more enjoyable parts of the game, but they're infrequent compared to the slower puzzles.\nThe bosses (that I've seen so far) are also mostly trial and error, which is... not fun. When you know what to do, they're utterly simple and nonthreatening but when you don't they're frustrating to try and figure out; the second boss is simplified once you know his full pattern but a bit tricky until you do... and notably this boss is one of those instances of SUDDENLY PUZZLE in the middle of a platforming section.\nI probably shoulddn't comment that the music is bland and the character designs/general visual style is ugly, but I will, because why not.\nI can't find a lot to like about this game. I can be clever or interesting at times, but it does nothing to really stand out from the many better platformers available for the same price or less. Pass on this one unless you're really desperate, I'd say.","January 23, 2015","false","18.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

That said, freezing time in midair in order to manipulate objects under you that can keep you alive is a challenging gimmick, and those who like a hardcore challenge will be delighted by the optional trials in each level. I wish the game were a little less bland, perhaps with a slightly more coherent story, and more of a variety of puzzle-solving tools (Blocks That Matter, for example), but you'll get at least a few hours of entertainment before the frustration sets in.","July 26, 2014","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game seems fairly simplistic at first but don't let that fool you it gets a lot harder going forward.\n\nThe controls are fairly precise but if you don't have anti ghosting keyboard you will be frustrated quite a bit as sometimes you have to both slide jump and direct at the same time which may not work so well if your keyboard can't register them all. The graphics are fairly simple but that works well, the music is decent but nothing to write home about. Levels are varied quite well along with the puzzles so you won't find yourself bored. Until you hit a wall that is.\n\nTypically through the levels you will have check points and failing only resets you back to the last checkpoint. However, bosses don't have any checkpoints, so you will be forced to replay the whole thing over and over. At first this is not so bad, but later on when you encounter guided missile/bombs it becomes a nightmare.\n\nOverall, a fairly good platformer which could have done things better but you should still check it out if you like that type of games. I'll warn you right away it is hard to finish so if that's a put off don't buy it. 8/10","March 14, 2015","true","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/266330/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Not a bad game, but a few design and control problems mar the overall experience. The platforming and level design is very fun. I like the time freezing but they don't use it for platforming enough and they use it too much for multi-part sequential puzzles where you need to get multiple different freezes in a row or you lose it all. The game is best during platforming. The biggest and most glaring idiotic design decision comes with the puzzles. In the game, there are checkpoints, which is nice (you could learn a thing or two, "mechanic escape" game), and dying restarts you. There is no restart checkpoint button for no apparent reason, but there is a restart level. The problem comes with the freezes. In most parts they give you just enough freezes to do the multi-freeze part. The problem is is if you haven't done it or make a tiny mistake and you don't use the freeze exactly how they want you to, you can't beat the part. In platforming areas its ok because you can kill yourself to restart the checkpoint. In many puzzle areas you cannot or you are trapped. This means you must RESTART THE ENTIRE LEVEL because you made one tiny error, undoing 5-10 min of other puzzles. What the hell was the ♥♥♥♥♥ developer thinking. Why not include restart checkpoints if at puzzle parts you have to complete the area with the bare essentials they gave you and if you screw up because you haven't done it before or you make a tiny error, you lose. That stupid design error takes major points away as it led to so much replaying the same areas. Then you basically have to use a walkthrough because you have to get it right because you don't want to have to replay the entire level again. Other big mistake is with boss fights, where if you get hit my one thing you must start it from the beginning, which once again leads to obnoxious repetitions of replaying parts you already beat. The control of the character is good, although sometimes he slides forward or keeps moving a bit too much. It could have been a bit tighter, but not terrible like in the game Mechanic Escape. Sometimes jumping off a wall back onto the same wall it messes up and it won't let you jump and you slide down. There is also no story. I would like to rate the game higher but too many puzzles, the few mistakes with platforming control, and problem with restarting checkpoints, and bossfights, end up getting it a 6.5/10.","January 22, 2015","true","15.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

The time freeze thing as a mechanic is good, but I'm not sure if it really saves Ethan Meteor Hunter. The vidoes are idemonstraive of the gameplay, so if you like what you see there then get the game.

Not because it does anything obviously bad, but because it's just... lame.
