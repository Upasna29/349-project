The developer Funky Logic Studios doesnt appear to monitor the steam forums or even have a website/forum to report issues to.  Everyone stay far away! The publisher Libredia	 hasn't answered an email I sent weeks ago.\n\nThere isnt any kind of player animation for casting, half the text isnt translated to english, it has no controller support, and when you do cast out and move the mouse around the lure moves in ways you couldnt with an actual fishing line. If a fish does take the bait you instantly catch the fish without having the fight of reeling it in or dealing with line tension(pretty much what you want in a fishing game experience).\n\nDon't waste your money.","November 21, 2014","false","0.2"," 50 of 55 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","50","55","0","0"
