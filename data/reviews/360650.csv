If you're an able bodied live mammal, with one functioning limb, you can beat this game without fail if you click the screen enough. The gameplay is comparative to RTS on rails, you get approximately two workers and two resource nodes each level to start, and you just remove road blockades and collect resources to remove blockades, all game. Every time you remove a blockade or gain a resource you get a skinner box dinner bell, ringing -dingaling.\n\nEach level takes approximately 3-5 minutes to do, where the only difficulty is waiting for the cooldown on resource nodes to refresh.\n\nThere are paths that diverge but have no significant variation, oh i go to the corner paths this time and unlock the draw bridge, or i go to the corner paths that turn the mirrors for the laser, or i go to the corner to collect an npc, dealing with every level feels bland. At the end of each level, you get a picture of a castle improvement, it's like strip poker but you're unveiling a stack of bricks. On level 1.8 (that's level 18), you upgrade the wall's moss. Yes, the ♥♥♥♥ing moss on the wall grows good job, equivalent of you getting a royal flush and the other player gives you a handful of their pubes.\n\nMusic the combination of lord of the rings, hobbit scene, and the sims combined with independence day.\n\nThere are cutscenes of a still image over a guy reading "poetry" with a gun held to his head.\n\nI don't feel sane playing this game for an hour.","August 8, 2015","false","0.9"," 600 of 828 people (72%) found this review helpful 255 people found this review funny","72","600","828","255","33"

Despite an 85% positive rating (August 2015) there are many negative reviews which seem to rank unusually high.  Their central complaint is that the game is too easy with little or no need to strategize.

I also have a breakdown of pros and cons below the video.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4ywThSTeYtA\n\nFrom the perspective of a clicker game:\n+ It's more than just "click this one thing"... it's has an interesting (perhaps even novel) mechanic (watch a couple minutes of the video to see it in action)\n+ The price is right. It's a mobile port for sure, but at least it has a mobile price.\n- In a pure clicker the fun is in optimizing to get maximum clickage... there's no optimization that resonated with me. Any optimization in what I clicked felt wholly unimportant.\n- No purchasable upgrades... it's nice to get something for the grind other than three stars.\n\nFrom the perspective of a time management game:\n+ no pros\n- No need for strategy, mastery, or optimization... it's just too shallow to even qualify as a proper time management game, IMO.","August 9, 2015","false","0.7"," 178 of 253 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","178","253","6","0"

It has cute and colorful 2.5D graphics and a lovely entertaining soundtrack (one song really sounds like Greek). Placed in the ancient Greek mythology you accomplish many tasks in 40 challenging levels, 4 bonus levels and 1 Superbonuslevel. You will buildup your own home castle of many pieces during the level proccess.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=538874013\nFirst thing in part three they eliminated all the bossfights. So each level10 is a normal level. Instead you must complete 4 different bonus levels after you got all puzzle pieces in a stage and solved the puzzle. In the end there comes the "superbonus level" - great. Part three has still the SAME soundtrack. Guess we won't listen to any new music in that series. The graphics seem slighly been improved and the gameplay is busy as in part two. The hardest is the limitation in levels. Not every level has thiefes, not every level has powerups. But the goals are quite hard to reach. Ok maybe this is because I'm still playing on expert mode. Quite pointless because somehow they forgot to implement global leaderboards ...","October 20, 2015","true","5.9"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","1"

Roles are reversed! So instead of having a Hercules that does nothing, here's come Megara... that isn't more active than him. But she's more useful than him: she can grow plants that will give you food.\n\nIndeed, as for the previous games, you sent your servants for resources gathering (gold, food, wood) in order to build or to expand houses, workshops, farms or gold mines that are periodically giving you... resources. But beware of the thieves that will take them if you're not fast enough! As usual, you have bonuses for stopping time, making the servants (or resources) work/walk faster, making more resources, etc... Nothing really changed from the previous games. Even Cerberus, Medusa or Pegasus are still present. There is however a new character, Charon, that can bring resources that are floating for one piece of gold.\n\nSo without real innovation, how come this game isn't boring? Because there is a challenge of beating high scores, because you want to see how the story finishes. That's the main reasons, for me at least. Indeed, the casual difficulty removes the timer and the Olympic time, so you have all the time in the world to finish the level. The normal difficulty has the timer while the higher difficulty has less time (and more points). Besides, you can unlock bonus levels by finding pieces of puzzles and reconstitue them.\n\nGraphics are like the previous game, very colorful and nice for a casual game. The soundtrack is still the same.\n\nIf you liked the two previous games, you'll like this one. You'll like also the fact that Hercules is the one to be saved now and that thanks to Megara, you'll have food quite early in the game that will appear periodically. The challenge is still present, so, yeah, you can go ahead, the price isn't too high, you have trading cards, achievements...","December 4, 2015","true","14.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

It’s a good time management game, but doesn’t live up to the predecessors.\n\nLong version:12 Labours of Hercules III: Girl Power is slowly falling into a common problem with time management series: it is running out of ideas.\n\nThe core mechanics are naturally untouched: you command a few servants who gather three types of resources used to clear the large amount of obstacles in your way. The mythological helpers return, but their role is much more limited; each stage is almost purely servant management.\nThis wouldn’t be that bad if the level layout would provide adequate challenge, but they are a little too gimmicky and uninspired. Game play is also slowed down by limiting the available servants on most levels to 2-3, which puts the difficulty somewhere between the first two games. Except for the bonus stages. Those are time management hell incarnate.\n\nThe series was never really big on story, and that didn't change: this time Hercules gets kidnapped and his wife Megara is on the rescue. This means no more Herc-only obstacles; they are replaced by food bushes only Megara can activate, further reducing the variety in level mechanics.\n\nGirl Power is still a fun game, but it is showing that the series is getting tired at this point and needs new ideas.","September 18, 2015","true","7.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

And since the series has created its own standard for time management games, who can blame them?\n\nThe third instalment is yet another simple but very polished example of the exact same recipe. And it's a good recipe, well worth the asking price for fans of the genre. The mechanics are solid, if unchanged, and the many and varied levels are decently designed. Plus, it's technically impeccable in its simplicity and understands its core audience. With a clean UI, clean and bright graphics, decent music and sound effects, a non-offensive overarching narrative that doesn't take itself seriously and is totally skippable, simple puzzle mini-games that aren't trying to be more than a breather in-between levels, lots of achievements, 3 difficulty levels and tons of content to keep you occupied for hours, it still ranks amongst the best time management games of this type out there.\n\nUnfortunately, as good as it may be, the recipe is starting to get a bit stale. Girl Power simply has nothing new to say; if you have played the first two games, this is one of the same, just a little less interesting, less well balanced and less inspired.\n\nYes, the levels are well enough designed. They just aren't as clever, fun and innovative as in the first two games.  I also didn't much like how the difficulty was scaled this time around. Ignoring the aptly named relaxed mode, I finished the game in casual mode feeling mildly disappointed at the lack of challenge. Then I started again in expert mode, which ramps up the challenge by a lot and is initially very exciting. However, the excitement ended about half way through, when I realised that too often getting a gold star wasn't going to be the fun process of coming up with a valid strategy, but repetition after repetition in order to learn it by heart. So none of the modes felt as satisfying to me as I had hoped.\n\nAgain, this is a solid casual time management game, that offers many hours of play with no technical or UI hassle and at a good price. It's just not as great as fans of the series were expecting.","May 20","true","12.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Slightly diversified (with new game play features, bonuses and surprises) to make each game a bit different, while keeping enough in common with the previouse one(s), which shortens waste of time and nerve on mastering the next game, that's valuable. Repetative, yet it feels all right here, can't remember myself being driven into bore even once. I beat all four games 100% on expert difficulty and still wouldn't mind to see the fifth. Taken into account the fact that games like these are not my idea of fun (or they weren't at least))) - what better recommendation could i give to a game. If you are looking for a highly involving and entertaining, not all that hard yet challenging enough game - check this one. Probably you will be pleased even beyond your expectations.\n---------------\nСерия из четырех одинаково отличных и очень качественно(во всех отношениях) сделанных игр- тайм менеджеров. Слегка отличающихся друг от друга (по набору игровых аспектов, бонусов и сюрпризов), ровно настолько чтобы не быть совсем однообразными, и при этом не вынуждать учиться играть заново, что несколько сокращает затраты времени и нервов на освоение каждой следующей игры, что порадовало. В принципе они достаточно однообразны, но здесь это не кажется недостатком, не помню ни разу чтобы это как то обломало интерес к игре.  Полностью прошел все четыре на экспертной сложности и не отказался бы от пятой. С учетом того, что сами игры далеко не из списка моих предпочтений (по крайней мере не были))), вряд ли я придумаю способ высказаться об игре в еще более позитивном духе.\nВ общем, если вы подыскиваете что-нибудь достаточно увлекательно-развлекательное, при этом не слишком сложное, но тем не менее бросающее определенный вызов вашим способностям в пределах разумных затрат времени и сил - то это как раз то что надо.

The most important segment introduced into the game is the new main character that joined us in battle to rescue Hercules, Medara. But they have also removed some things like boss battles and mini-games which may be a bit sad for the veterans of the series. But the difficulty was also scaled a lot, which will prove to be a more challenge than the last game for the achievement hunters, as they have to think fast, click rapidly and to not offer their souls to the god of rage quitting.\n\n\nPros- Support for Achievements, Trading Cards and Steam Cloud.\n- Won't get boring easily since pretty much every level has to offer something else.\n- Touchscreen support, a wonderful opportunity for the Windows 8 and 10 users.\n- Same gameplay mechanics as the previous games, which is a relief for many fans.\n- Say bye bye to the boss battles, but while the developers removed those, the hardest difficulty it's a lot more difficult than the one from the previous games.\n- Colorful graphics, which shall be a very nice friend to your eyes.\n- Hidden puzzle pieces around each mission for collectors to find, which later on will let you play a bonus level.\n- Plenty of achievements to keep you determined in completing the game.\n\nCons- The minigames got removed.\n- Same music as the first games of the series.\n- A short story that won't find it's place in your heart.\n\nConclusionWhile the game may look exactly like the first games of the series, it still ranks amongst the best time management games of this type out there. So if you're a fan of the series, then go ahead and buy it as you will find in it the same excitement and fun you've found in the previous titles. For the newcomers, I advice you to start with the first game because that's where everyone else started. And it won't be nice to start from part three, would it?\nI definitely recommend this game for the casual players that need something nice and relaxing in their life. And even the achievement hunters can benefit on the back of this game that will provide a nice challange for them to test their skills.\n\nThis review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to both Steamified and Gentleman Squid Studio for providing the key for review purposes.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

This game uses a strategy mechanism of you bulid a building and wait for the resouces to appear in your Inventory. So this means that you need to choose which building to bulid first and which path to take first as to not run out of time. Every 10th level is a mini game that breaks up the game and add a bit of fun to the game. Only thing that is missing is a casual difficulty level and developer score beat achievement.\n\nSecond Game:\nThis game changes the resouce management to more touch based. this means you bulid a building and then your resouce ends up on a stone circle and you have to click this resouce to collect it other wise on some levels the thieves will sell your resouces. There is also added bonus levels (without achievements to play) and developer score beat achievement\n\nThrid Game:\nBasically like the second but achievement to play bonus levels. first 28 levels do not include hercules. You much now grow your berry bushes before you can harvest them. The best part IMO has been taken out "Bonus levels" and replaced with another level the same as the rest.\n\nCons:\nMusic to this series is horrible turn it off.\nThe bell to collect the resouces can give you a headace after playing for a while.\nThis game gets more and more like a touch based game with every release.\nThe story is also non existence and does not continue between games\n\nPros:\nI got first one in the series for NZD:$0.85","October 18, 2015","false","9.4"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","15","28","2","3"

Previous installments as follows: 12 Labours of Hercules, 12 Labours of Hercules - Cretan Bull.\n\nNote: There is a storyline for the game but it isn't much to it nor its' rememberable. Gameplay formula is pretty much the same as the previous ones.\n\nThis is a time management game, where careful planning is required, limited amount of resources that are available throughout the game; henced the word management.\n\nThis game has the total of four episodes with 11 levels each; totaling out 44 levels altogether. There twenty-two different achievements but each of them come with a requirement. There are also puzzle pieces to find throughout the game. The four bonus levels that can be unlock when the jigsaw puzzle is completed. Plus, there is a 'super bonus' level that can be unlock after completing the final bonus level.\n\nThere are three modes, relaxed; casual and expert, the difference between them is the timer speed and scoring. In relaxed mode, no timer and no scoring. In casual mode, the timer drain a slowly and the scoring is moderately low. In expert mode, the timer drain much quicker and the scoring is much higher.\n\nThe stars that are earned from completing the level depends upon on how much time is left on the timer. This only applies to the causal and expert modes\n\nThree Gold star is when the time has not gone pass the arrow. Two Silver star is when the time has gone pass the arrow. One Bronze star is when the timer is completely empty.\n\nReplaying any of the levels will improve the game score and the amount star.\n\nThere are few special bonuses: Freeze Time, Worker Movement/Work Speed, Additional Worker and Increases Resources. All of these special bonuses has a certain time limit but they can be used again once the bar fills-up. These special bonuses are very useful when the game is being played on expert mode.\n\nI don't think that this game much of replay value to it. If you're into time management games then you might find this game somewhat enjoyable to certain extent.\n\n\nReviews for other games of this series:\n12 Labours of Hercules\n12 Labours of Hercules II: The Cretan Bull","November 25, 2015","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this case, we find a delightful twist with his wife, Megara trying to rescue him, along with his devoted servants and monster friends. The gameplay is the same as the previous two, but more similar to the second game which had puzzle pieces and achievements to beat developer's records.  While it is relatively easy and good for a casual go, you still need to strategize your actions accordingly in the higher levels especially. In addition, it can be challenging when you are trying to get 100% achievements. The game itself is  nothing new, with the same bright art and lovely music; however if you enjoyed the previous  two games, you should definitely go for this one. In the end, I can say it's a fun game and the series is one to  give it try.","January 31","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are in for some casual fun, though, you will get bored quickly, as the game is simply too repetitive and easy - you can finish every level in 4-5 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, if you want to "reach" the expert objectives on all levels and find the hidden puzzle piece, you will oftentimes find yourself clicking in frustration and hoping that you will meet the objectives just in time. Not exactly what I look for in a game, but oh well...\n\nI've played quite a few games of this type and I am yet to finish a single one of them. 12 LoH III is abolutely identical to other games in the genre, so again, if you like clicking stuff repeatedly in a colorful and ancient Greek setting, you should give this one a try.\n\nStill wouldn't pay the full 3 euros for it, though - there are lots of better games in the same price range.","November 27, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think this is an improvement for sure. Hope they keep this for the next game.\n\nI don't really understand the name of the game? Girl Power?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abenlen/recommended/360650/","abenlen","abenlen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abenlen/","176 products in account","A very good example of the casual  time-management (CTM) game genre.\n\nIf you've played the other two games in the series this one will hold little in the way of surprises for you.  Really the only difference is that you are playing as Hercules' wife, Megara, in her efforts to save her husband and their dog (of the three headed variety) from a grabby tentacle sea monster.  If you are looking for a game that faithfully inserts the player into the plot of a classic Greek myth you might want to seek elsewhere.\n\nIf you're not hung up on  classical literacy accuracy or the ability to play as a male protagonist, and you like low stress play experience that CTM's game typically provide, this game won't disappoint.  The levels typically take 3 to 5 minutes to complete, at least at the lower levels that I played.  The pace is quick, with very little downtime waiting for resources to  mature to the point that you can harvest them.  The goals are clear, so you don't spend time wondering what the heck you're supposed to be working towards.  You can spend some brainpower trying to find the best way to manage your resources to get the told time or to beat the top of the scoreboard, but with an untimed relaxed mode there is no need to do this if you don't feel like it.  I do like that you can change the difficulty at any time,  from untimed, normal play, and hard, then back again if you feel like it.   The storyline is coherent and engaging as long as you accept that it is based on Greek Mythology in the way the Disney's Haunted Mansion ride is based on the study of spiritualism.    The graphics are bright and cartoonly peppy as befitting a game of this sort.  And the music is easily mutable, which is how I play all my games, so perhaps I am not the best reviewer to talk about that aspect.\n\nThis doesn't have the depth of Skyrim or the viseral thrill ride quality of Farcry 4, but it really doesn't have to.  It's a cute, fun little timewaster, much like my kitty who try to "help" me tie my shoelaces.\n\n8/10 For games of this type, not all computer games ever made.","August 8, 2015","true","12.6"," 27 of 82 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","27","82","2","6"

It is a really beautfiul game, set in a nice, fantasy universe of the Greek Mythology where you play with Megara, Hercules, Medusa, The Pegasus, Nemean Lion and other legendary beings.\n\nThe aim of the game is to meet certain objectives such as gathering a set amount of resources or getting to a specific object or objects on the map. To reach these goals, the player has to gather resources which are spread across the map or produce them in some of the little 'workshops'. The resources are put on the map in a road like way so that to get to some farther away resources you need to clear the previous ones. The game is part of a genre of resource gathering and road clearing where we also have Roads of Rome and many other similar games. Also, I finished the game without encountering any sort of bugs.\n\nI really enjoyed this game. It has a very pleasant, positive atmoshpere and message and it is very relaxing and charming, something which is very rare now in video games. The level design is nice, I really like the nice objects, colours, terrain, buildings, strategy of the game, the music which is perfectly suited to theme, story and I think everything about it. A great game, I recommend it to everyone. For 1 euro, I got 6 hours of wonderful entertainment and after finishing it, I have a very good feeling. Thank you developers. This is the third Hercules game I played, hope to see a lot more in the future! :D","August 9, 2015","true","6.9"," 15 of 60 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","15","60","0","0"

Do as I did and buy it for under a dollar. Worth at least twice that much though.\n\nThe good:\n* It's Time Management with a unique queueing system (ie you can queue unavailable items) that actually makes for interesting gameplay.\n* The graphics, sound, gameplay etc. are all good.\n* The visual and audio feedback work a treat allowing you to know where to spend your attention (and where not to).\n* The addition of puzzle pieces is a nice touch. You can even find them before starting the level so you don't have to waste time searching during gameplay.\n\nThe bad:\n* It's short. I played thru it twice and it still felt like it wasn't worth full retail price.\n* It's a little too easy. I got gold on most levels on my first try.\n* The effects and tooltips can get in the way of seeing what you're actually supposed to do.\n* The "cutscenes" are pretty awful. Badly written and presented poetry sound off above non-animated paper dolls.\n* The story itself is a bit confusing too.

People who give thumbs down probably don't know what is this game for. Maybe it's not for everyone but this game is perfect for one thing - everybody knows these boring late afternoons when you need to do something, f.e. a presentation for your work or essay on medieval British literature or whatever... but you can't concentrate, you need to turn off your brain for let's say 15 minutes or just to relax and get some new ideas. And in such situations this game is a blessing - regular game would be suicide, because you would end up playing the whole evening and doing nothing else and then you would be stressed out. This game is fun for those 15 minutes (not even a minute more) and than you can go back to your work and play it in the next boring afternoon again. You can play it on anything, it loads fast, no waiting, brilliant! and it has trading cards, which is definitely pro.","November 18, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it maintains the same basic elements a few things have changed. First off, most of the achievements are the same but they did switch up a few to include getting gold times in the bonus levels and then in the "super bonus" level. The second game first introduced these levels that were unlocked by finding the puzzle pieces on each map. This third installment rewards you for completing the bonus levels by giving you a fifth extra level after completion of the four bonus levels. I feel like this made the game sufficently long. The second thing, is they took away your typical "boss fights" and instead of having that little bit of reprieve by a slight change of game play, you play the boss levels just like the regular ones. I feel like this made it drag a bit since there is no reprieve from the typical game play. That being said, it was still an enjoyable game. I also like the addition of the new character Magara. You use her to grow the berry bushed used as a food source. This extra element was really nice and add some nice touches.\n\nPros:\n-Keeps the standard RTS elements\n-New and more challenging levels\n-Proactive story, gameplay, art, and style\n-New elements to add some refresh to the series\n-Somewhat simple achievements\n-Appropriate length of gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Lack of typical boss fights (adds some drag to the game)\n\nMehs:\n-Developer scores are better making them more difficult to beat\n-Thieves seem more aggressive\n\nOverall: 9.5/10","February 24","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this case, we find a delightful twist with his wife, Megara trying to rescue him, along with his devoted servants and monster friends. The gameplay is the same as the previous two, but more similar to the second game which had puzzle pieces and achievements to beat developer's records. While it is relatively easy and good for a casual go, you still need to strategize your actions accordingly in the higher levels especially. In addition, it can be challenging when you are trying to get 100% achievements. The game itself is nothing new, with the same bright art and lovely music; however if you enjoyed the previous two games, you should definitely go for this one.
