It is a fantastic action RPG that had a rough release due to glitches and bugs and it never got the love it deserved. I really am saddened a bit that a ton of gamers out there missed out on this game because of all the bad PR over issues that have been fixed through patches. The game still holds up even today. The combat is so satisfying and puts other 1st person RPGs to shame. The use of physics is amazing and really alows you to approach fights how you want, as a fighter, mage, archer or a mix. If you're looking for a hidden gem, then this is the game for you. It'll be bitter sweet when you end up having so much fin with it, and then you realise how you missed out on the multiplayer that the game offered. But at least you got to experience the single player.\n\n5/5","September 13, 2013","true","5.1"," 121 of 128 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","121","128","0","1"

Despite putting you on a linear path, there are just so many different ways you can go about handling yourself along the path, and I personally enjoy that. In addition, there are plenty of awesome secrets that leave me looking around for any kind of secret buttons or breakable walls along the way, and I just love how this game rewards you for it. Upon launching, I noticed this game is run on Source Engine, which had me delightfully surprised. DMMM Utilizes the technology wonderfully and the combat alone would leave me thinking it was a different engine entirely.\n\nDownsides consist of crashes, which are long beyond being worked on due to the game's age. However, if you're able to fix those loading crashes, then I guarantee that a great game waits for you on the other side of those loading screens, however cheesy some of the characters and dialogue are.\n\nBasically, I'm giving this a 10 outta 10, because I haven't had this much fun with a singleplayer RPG since Oblivion and Skyrim. Definitely on par, and plenty of variety to keep you going.","November 28, 2013","true","11.9"," 89 of 92 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","89","92","0","0"

It was probably the first fantasy FPS I've seen.\nGot it on a sale and boy was I pleasantly surprised. I've played the whole game through in one sitting.\n\nDespite the story, characters and voice acting being rather generic and the game being very linear, the combat and mechanics of the game are really good.\nThe game features multiple weapon types such as swords, daggers, bows, axes, staffs and shields. Tools such as hammers and pickaxes can be used as weapons too.\nThe game has 3 (small) skill trees that all can be leveled independently (though it is recommended to stick to one at the beginning) and unlock new combat moves, spells or increase your basic stats.\nCombat is pretty simple but can be approached in different ways. You can throw props at enemies and kick them into hazards. Use a frost spell to freeze the ground and watch them slip off into a pit. Priceless.\n\nBecause it runs on the Source engine you can expect decent physics. The game has a lot of destructible objects lying around that you can use to throw at your enemies.\nThe game even has half life 2's gravity gun (reskined into a telekinesis spell) that you can use to mess around with.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that you can grab and climb up ledges, ropes and chains. Later in the game you also get a rope bow that lets you attach ropes to wooden surfaces and climb up them.\n\nI'm not arachnophobic but god damn the spiders in this game. The game seems to have a serious spider fetish. In fact the whole story is linked to spiders.\n\nSpeaking about spiders, they are absolutely terrifying. Reason being that the character and npc design in terms of models and textures is great. Stuff looks interesting and quite believable. From dull gray castle guards and bald necromancers to sexy demon ladies. All really well made.\n\nWhen specing into the stealth build the game suffers from the same problem Skyrim does. You can stand in darkness or crouch in semi dark areas and just backstab enemies one by one as others come to check what happened. It becomes ridiculously easy to kill enemies. Not to mention just shoot your bow from a hidden spot and enemies will not know what hit them. If you get spotted however you'll have a hard time as the game is pretty darn hard. I started on the hard difficulty and had to start over because it was too hard, especially because I didn't spec the right skills at the start.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nPros:\n-Fun, diverse combat\n-Good physics\n-Kicking things\n-Great npc design in terms of models and textures\n-Kicking things into other things\n-Optional quests that change certain story aspects and the final outcome; multiple endings\n-Kicking things off things\n-Rope bow\n-Kicking things into other things\n-Gravity gun\n-Replay value\n-Source engine; runs great on old pcs while looking relatively good\n-Multiple routes in some cases\n-Lots of worthwhile secrets.\n\nCons:\n-Generic characters\n-Predictable story\n-Boring voice actors\n-Linear levels\n-Little RPG elements; no stores, no open world, no backtracking\n-No mod tools (considering it's the source engine); dead multiplayer as a result\n-Conveniently placed spiky plates to kick enemies into everywhere\n\nGreat game overall. Really underrated. Definitely gets a must play recommendation from me.","March 14, 2014","true","11.8"," 83 of 87 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","83","87","0","4"

This is simply one of the best videogames I've ever played. Sure it's story is generic but it is executed pretty darn well. What really stands out in this game is it's combat mechanics and I love games with an in-depth combat system. In all my experiences with combat mechanics in games, nothing tops this masterpiece of a game. It it truly satisfying to pull off different moves and have variation in what you do all of which affect your enemies in the slightest but most unique ways. Harness the potential power of your environment with throwable objects and traps to use against your enemies which is the most enjoyable part of this game. All of this is made possible with the SOURCE ENGINE! So not only do these abilities and such sound good but are executed equally as good!\n\nWhat I also admire is it's Immense replayablility for a game that seems so linear. The game presents you these three playstyles that you can go full out on one or try and experiment between them and create cool hybrids. There are no boundaries, no "choose your class" type ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it just gives you the game and goes "go nuts". And the repayability that this creates is awesome! Speaking of replayability, you can also find secret areas along your travels and the game also sports multiple endings!\n\nAll of this is played in FPS which adds onto the immersion. Not many fantasy games play out in FPS which makes this game pretty unique in that sense.\n\nThe game is more feature rich than you would think. But my only gripe about this game is the voice acting. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE VOICE ACTING...at least from the main protagonist. If you can get past it like I did, you'll have a bomb of a time.\n\nNote: Do not buy this game for the multiplayer, I've tried it and absolutely NOBODY plays it.\n\n9/10","July 1, 2014","true","16.9"," 77 of 82 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","77","82","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakedaYabu/recommended/2100/","TakedaYabu","大名 Tanegashima","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakedaYabu/","187 products in account","Dark Messiah of Might & Magic puts players in a first-person perspective, allowing them to immerse themselves in the legendary Might and Magic universe as never before.\n\nIt is also the world's first fantasy action game to feature a complete first-person combat system. It takes full advantage of the Source Engine's exceptional technological enhancements in areas such as character animation, advanced AI, real-world physics and shader-based rendering.\n\n- Ubisoft\n\nI have played this game during my early childhood and I must admit that once I started playing this game I felt stuck to it and completed it over and over again multiple times.\nA game that despite being released in 2006, it’s yet fully capable of taking down some modern games within the same genres.\n\nA fine example of what a good adventure and a first-person action game should be, Dark Messiah of Might & Magic is a remarkable example at its finest.\n\nOverall aspects of Dark Messiah of Might & Magic\nAdventure combined with the storyline:\n\nThe adventure that this game is capable of, is reasonable with the addition of secret places that contributes to a careful exploration of each area players find themselves in. Despite being strictly locked only to its main quest and some other minor side quests, it also contains a short amount of role-playing and key decisions throughout the game.\n\nThe storyline isn’t the best, it lacks a strong backbone or a base to begin from, and it is based mostly in surprise elements and new elements that will always shape players way of thinking and seeing things as they progress further in the game.\n\nGraphics and game play mechanics:\n\nThe graphics Dark Messiah is capable of projecting with its Source Engine, despite not being the best for its time, are still pretty good and well-balanced with the game play mechanics and user interface.\n\nAbout the game mechanics, it is focused not only to give players a very pleasant first person melee/ranged combat experience with many different styles and opponents, but also a strong presence of the use of the surrounding game atmosphere and items during all sorts of conflict.\n\nCombat:\n\nDespite the rich game combat moves the game allows players to execute, you might feel that most conflicts you face will be ultimately resolved by the use of front kicks combined with the use of the game surroundings and objects around to terminate your enemies.\n\nThis can be easily a 'Pro' for most players since it is quite enjoyable to watch enemies being kicked off to spikes or to be kicked off against fragile wooden crates, but maybe a 'Con' for some.\n\nUser interface:\n\nThe user interface in this game is simple, clean and again, it does match well with everything else giving players a very good gaming experience.\nThere is only one way to access your character info, skill points, and quick toolbar which is located at the right top side of your inventory that offers a very simple and easy way to access everything you want.\n\nMusic and the voice acting:\n\nDespite this game containing more sounds related to the atmosphere of each part of the game than music itself, both are pretty much reasonable in the end I would say.\n\nThe voice acting is decent I believe, but sometimes it just feels that it doesn’t fit whenever there is music being played during a cut scene and voice simultaneously.\n\nGame difficulty:\n\nThe game difficulty is very well balanced to meet the tastes of those who wish a enjoyable adventure without struggling that much, to those who want it hardcore with difficult opponents.\n\nPrice:\n\nThe game price that has also been the same for the last few years is incredibly worth it, with or without sales, the content and adventure this game has to offer is totally worth its base price.\n\nConclusion\nI would rate this game 79 out of 100 or 3.9 out of 5.0 stars. An enjoyable adventure with a fair amount of content and a vast adventure with decent graphics and game play for a very good price.","June 17, 2015","true","16.2"," 92 of 104 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","92","104","3","10"

To be honest, the story is lame, the levels are pretty linear, and after one or two playthroughs you aren't likely to find any new hiding spots for super-secret treasure(though there are quite a few of them).\n\nBut this game's combat makes up for all of its flaws, story or otherwise. I have never played a game with more engaging, interesting, or balanced combat than this one. It's the only reason I come back to this game, and as you can see from my logged hours, I have come back to this game time and time again.\n\nThe combat is fairly basic to begin with, you can hit things hard or not so hard, you can block with a shield or parry with a one-handed weapon, you can shoot enemies from far away with a bow. However, as you progress into the game and start earning skill points, combat very quickly becomes a deep experience. The game carries three classic releplaying game archetypes: the mage, the rogue, and the warrior. But the part that makes it so wonderful is the complete freedom you have to spend your skill points in any way you please. You can be sneaking up on your opponents wearing heavy armor and slinging fireballs if you want to.\n\nJust play the game, that's really all there is to it. It's well worth the meager investment.","November 1, 2014","true","65.1"," 73 of 80 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","73","80","0","1"

After that much time playing this game, I can safely tell you, it's worth it on a sale. Here's why:\n\nEver wanted a game with a story as good as the first Half Life, that's as linear, but more RPG-Like? Then, this is your game. The only difference, is that the main character speaks, and you have legs as your crowbar.\n\nMade with the source engine, the graphics of the game still look great today. The story, even though not being a f#cking master-piece, it's decent and entertaining, and the gameplay...Well, ♥♥♥♥ing love it.\n\nYou can be, whatever you want to be. You want to be like Havel from Dark Souls, a huge armored rock that slays everthing in one hit, but it's slow as progress with Half Life 3? Want to be a camping sniper who can trickshot someone in the balls in slow motion? Want to be the medieval Adan Jensen, and use stealth to the max, executing people from the back? Or just want to be Leonidas, and kick everyone on the balls, and throw them to the pits of hell? I'm not kidding, I did that already, even sended the video to a famous channel long time ago.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCpNJbKedF8\n\nYou also have offensive and defensive magic, and they're also fun to use...But I always end up taking stealth. The game has a few endings, and counting that this is as linear as modern FPS's (but with four times thework on the actual game), it's good!\n\nThe game also has multiplayer. Now, I don't know if the multiplayer comes already with the full game, or you buy it stand-alone, but sadly, it's almost dead. You have to understand, the game is really old...But there are still a few servers, most of them russian servers. And if you're able to play without getting banned by "hacking" (turns out, I'm superior, must be the afro hair), you'll have fun. The matches are team-based with 5 classes, mostly being the Spy-backstabbing-son-of-a-wh#re, the archer-sniping-MLG-kid, the SUPERIOR-REAL-SOVIET-DAMAGING-Black Mage, the White-Medic-Mage, and the generic Melee-HOLDMOUSE1TOWIN-Knight. You win XP in the matches, to get extra skills and stuff, and each match is entertaining...Even though some stuff is a bit over-powered. There's variety, though. Just think, for example: Healing magic also damages enemies, and you can set how much you want it to heal, and how much to damage!\n\nThis game is, like I said, like a RPG-Half Life. And a good one, at that. Since the multiplayer is almost deserted, I'd say it's worth 5-8€ at max, but the money will be well spent.\n\nAND DON'T BE A ♥♥♥♥♥ IN MULTIPLAYER, SPAMMING THE GOD-DAMN RAISE ON WHITE MAGES.

Highly recommended, and the price is very low; give it some initial love, and you will be rewarded by several hours of enjoyable gameplay.\nWant details? Read below.\n\nWhen I first heard about this game, I thought "Come on, melee fighting in... first-person view only? Ridiculous." It turns out it is way better than I thought. The game actually manages to be very enjoyable, despite the fact it has its flaws. Yes, the first-person view is a major flaw because you can't see much, as a big part of the screen is covered by your shield, your daggers, or even your own hands when using some spells. However, in practice it is not as bad as it sounds, and in some ways first-person view makes things more interesting, provided you get used to the hitboxes of your weapons.\n\nThe learning curve is rather steep in the beginning, but it gets better soon. The game is not an RPG really, but has some RPG elements. There is no experience or stats; you earn skill points as you complete your objectives, and you can use those skill points to learn some abilities or spells; neat and simple. There are no classes; instead, there are three skill trees, somehow representing the typical fighter, rogue/archer, and mage classes. However, the player is free to distibute skill points as he/she pleases, so it is quite possible to be a warrior with some magical or stealth abilities, and such combinations actually work very well in practice. I personally found the sword fighter + archer combo quite enjoyable, and probably the easiest way to play this game. A "thief" build is also interesting, and it is actually quite possible to go stealth for the most part of the game.\n\nMelee fighting is probably the most interesting aspect of Dark Messiah. You have some fighting moves, and using them you can make your opponent walking lame, or you can decapitate him. Fighting is far from being the usual, boring click fest. It needs player's skills instead.\nAs usual in similar PC games, the controls are clunky, and some players will probably quit playing early because of this. For example, hold left mouse button "for a second" to activate power attack; hold direction keys while holding down the left mouse key to activate alternative power attacks; additionally, hold space bar for a jump attack. All that when you have a bunch of enemies in front of you. Seriously, if that's not clunky controls, I don't know what "clunky controls" means. Things would be way better if you could use a controller instead of mouse and keyboard. Nevertheless, once you get used of the controls, melee fighting is really enjoyable. It has not the nice controls of Dark Souls, but it is still quite enjoyable. Most players will probably pick a warrior combo because of this, despite the controls.\n\nAs in Half-Life 2, you can use the environment to get rid of your enemies. Shoot a loose supporting beam so that the barrels above fall on a bunch of bad guys; cut a rope so that a rock pendulum hits a mighty cyclops that blocks your way; kick your enemy so that he falls off a cliff, etc. Physics reminds Half-Life 2, and that's not a coincidence, as Dark Messiah uses the same game engine. Using the environment is just another nice aspect of the game.\n\nThe plot is nothing innovative, but it is certainly interesting. You are a guy, trying to get an ancient artifact from the bad guys. Nothing new so far; however, there are two hot girls hitting on you. Leanna is the "good girl" who will fight on your side in many cases, and eventually falls in love with you, although she is too shy to admit it openly. Xana is some kind of a succubus, a demonic creature that lives inside you, gives you useful information depending on the situation and, most importantly, comments on what's going on. Xana's commentary is actually the funniest part of this game: she is jealous about Leanna, and always has some ironic and quite funny comments about her.\nA spice of humor is spread all over the game. It's not only Xana's comments mentioned above, but also NPCs talk to eachother, quite often in a funny way: enemy soldiers talking about their boss ironically, goblins discussing if they should eat the orc they just killed, and several other things that will make you smile.\nThere are some nice cutscenes, but luckily the developers didn't overuse them. I am really tired of today's ridiculous "AAA" games with a cutscene every few seconds and zero gameplay. Dark Messiah is definitely not one of them, and I am quite happy with that.\n\nEventually, you will have to take decisions, which leads to a few different endings of the game. However, the game is basically linear; personally, I prefer that instead of the chaotic gameplay of Elder Scrolls, for example - although a lttle more non-linearity in Dark Messiah would be nice. Not to mention fighting in Dark Messiah is actually way better than the simplistic fighting in Elder Scrolls. Hard to remember a similar, but non-linear game, that managed to keep me playing till its end.\n\nGraphics are typical for the Source engine used. Although not that realistic as in modern games, graphics certainly serve their purpose very well. I also liked the music of the game, and in general sound does its job: no complaints, no awards. Voice actors also do their job, with Moon Dailly performing very well as Xana.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer mode for Dark Messiah. I imagine this would be quite fun, but sadly it is non-existant in practice. Official server is down, probably because this game was first released 9 years ago. Unless you have friends interested to play, forget about multiplayer.\n\nI read some people had techinical issues with this game. This was not the case for me; no issues in a mediocre laptop running Windows 7 64 bit. No FPS drops, no tearing, with maximum quality settings on - very good performance, typical for the Source engine used in the game. I had a few game crashes, especially when running other programs in the background, but nothing really serious, and probably caused by the laptop's low RAM.\n\nThe game is rather easy in "normal" mode - provided you pass the steep initial learning curve. There are some annoyingly hard enemies, but in general you won't have serious problems beating the game, including bosses. Expect a 20-30 hours of gameplay in your first playthrough, if you want to explore everything and find all secret places in the game. Replayability is rather low: once I beated the game, I started over using a stealth build and tried a different ending but, other than that, there is no more replayability to talk of.\n\nFinal verdict: I don't give a positive review easily, but Dark Messiah definitely desrves it, despite the flaws mentioned.

I only recently Activated it on Steam. As usual, SEE CONCLUSION if you find this review too long.\n\nINTRO:\nSet in the UBISOFT world of Ashan (Heroes V world), you play an adventurer named Sareth who sets out on a quest to stop the "Dark Messiah" from releasing the imprisoned Demon Lord who was prophesied to return.\n\nDark Messiah of Might and Magic is one of the earlier first person magic/melee games of Arkane Studios who would later go on to make Dishonored. This game has a completley different game mechanic from the original Might and Magic games of 3DO and New World Computing.\n\nPROS:\n+ Decent Graphics: - This game utilizes the Source Engine. Although, It may not be the most graphically advanced game, it brings, a decent enough atmosphere and pretty environments with a commendable quality texture work.\n\n+ Combat Mechanic: - Also a CONS (See Below). This game has a good blend of magic, melee and ranged combat. Dealing with different kinds of foes may require you to adopt different tactic to efficiently dispose of your target. Stealth mechanic works fairly well. (Not even close to Thief or Dishonored, but enough to satisfy a more stealthy approach on the missions.)\n\n+ Story: - I personally liked the story which is directly related to the Heroes of Might and Magic universe that I'm a fan of. The plot twists and conflicts are well delivered along with some interesting characters. As usual, this is my own opinion and some people might disagree with me.\n\n+ Lengthy Campaign: -Long enough to deliver the story in a satisfying manner. This game also features  multiple ending scenario where your actions would directly impact the game's ending. It Suffers from the Mass Effect 3 Syndrome though. (Feel free to ask me on what the ME3 Syndrome is.)\n\nCONS:\n- Combat Mechanic: - Also a PRO (See Above). Despite the availability of different items, magics and tactics, they are all trumped by your might BOOT. Kicking your target either to stun them or send them to spikes (which are conveniently placed) defeats the purpose of having different kinds of weapons, magic and equipment. It becomes repetitive at times.\n\n- Unnecessary Multiplayer: - There are games that were meant for Singleplayer, this is one such game. Unfortunately, for us, a poorly implemented multiplayer is present which most likely diverted some of the developer's money which would have been better spent on advancing the Singleplayer experience.\n\n- Cheesy Voice Acting: - I did enjoy the voice acting but that's me, most people will probably get annoyed with it and so I place it here as a CON.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThough I generally RECOMMEND this game, I, however, think that new players or people new to the Might and Magic lore may not be able to fully appreciate its true value. This is best played by people already familar with Might and Magic. This game is underrated in my honest opinion.\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED if you're looking for an old school Might and Magic (VI to VIII) experience. For that, check out Might and Magic X or Legend of Grimrock. Also not for people looking for an Elder Scrolls experience.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gndjester/recommended/2100/","gndjester","Helios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gndjester/","184 products in account","A cult classic from the creators of Dishonored, Dark Messiah is an interesting game.  It's listed as an RPG but that's misleading; it's like calling Dishonored an RPG.  Both have skill trees, both have a very small amount of decision making which results in low chaos vs high chaos in Dishonored.  Without spoiling anything, Dark Messiah is similar in that regard.  It's not truly an RPG, there are no dialogue choices or anything like that.  There are simply three major plot decisions.\n\nOne particularly interesting aspect in this game is that you don't necessarily play as the good guy.  I'll just leave it at that without spoiling much.\n\nThis game is known primarily for its gameplay mechanics, combat in particular.  It's a first person action game that has separate skill trees for melee combat, magic, archery, as well as some miscellaneous skill trees.  Furthermore, there are different types of melee weapons to choose from: twin daggers, swords, and staves.  Each has different properties, pros, cons, and combat animations.\n\nOne of the best features of this game's melee combat is that you have different swings/strokes depending on your movement.  Holding W and releasing a power attack for example delivers a different attack than holding A + power strike.  This is something I've demanded for years, and this is one of few games that offers it.\n\nMost spells are offensive and elemental based but there are some exceptions.  The player is expected to go down every weapon skill tree apparently, since archery is too useful in boss fights.\n\nThis being a source game, it's almost entirely physics based.  Arkane Studios took advantage of this and emphasized using the environment to kill your opponents.  Knock down a bunch of heavy debris on them, kick them off of a cliff, impale them on spikes, you name it.  Combined with the ability to chain spell effects and other things together (e.g., spill oil on an area and light it on fire with a fire spell or arrow, or shoot a lightning spell into water to electrify it), Dark Messiah seems to provide more ways to kill opponents than any other game, and you can see from my library that I've played a lot.  Even more ways to kill people than Dishonored, which lacks the environmental emphasis.\n\nPeople often say that The Elder Scrolls games should have this game's combat.  They are absolutely right.  Conceptually, this game has the best combat mechanics of any action game.  However, despite everything I just said, the gameplay/combat is riddled with flaws/oversights, the game lacks an engaging story/plot (RotFodder's pizza analogy is spot on), and it may be a bit too long for its own good.\n\nThe combat is fantastic on paper but has flawed execution.  First of all, the game is quite rough around the edges and clipping issues are fairly common which is extremely annoying.  There are some stupid delays when blocking attacks and counter attacking, or using daggers, and other situational things like that.  Also, unlike most first person action games, you actually have to be very precise with your swings.  It seems like the player's hitbox with melee weapons is actually the weapon itself; this makes sense, however it's not good in practice.  This type of thing only works with the Wii controller, it's stupid to have it in a regular game like this.  Reach/range is really wonky in this game.  Goblins seem to have the same reach as humans and orcs.\n\nAt the end of the day this game comes across as quite clunky by modern standards, but by 2006 standards it must have been a gift from God (I didn't play it in 2006 but I've played plenty of 2006 games in 2006, Red Steel was the best action game I had played at the time).  Because of it's clunkiness I find it less enjoyable than Dishonored as an action game.  Dishonored's mix of advanced action mechanics and unbelievable, flawless fluidity is only matched by the Shadow Warrior remake.  But then Dark Messiah has so many advantages like the environmental uses, spell/effect combos, and more varied melee attacks than Dishonored.  As usual, we'll never get it all.\n\nDark Messiah is known to be challenging, but it has that old school unbalanced challenge where if you raise the difficulty, enemies just deal far more damage than you even when using the same attack.  It will take around ten flame arrow spells to kill a regular human opponent for example, but they can kill you in four (and that's with upgraded max health).  If you like unbalanced no holds barred difficulty then perhaps you'll like this, otherwise I recommend sticking to Normal mode which is more balanced.  I favor balanced difficulty with smart AI.  This game's AI is functional enough although hilariously bad at times.\n\nDishonored is known for its stealth, and that's one area where this game lacks.  It's far more linear than Dishonored, the climbing system is awfully clunky and barely works (clunkier than Thief Gold's even), and you're generally unable to one hit kill enemies from behind even with backstab.  This game is clearly meant to be an action game first, stealth game secondary.  To this day Dishonored remains the only game I've seen that's equally proficient in both.\n\nIn terms of atmosphere, this game bears an uncanny resemblence to Thief.  Some sections even tricked me into pressing Thief's key bindings!  The resemblence is so strong at times, particularly in crypts.  This game also has a Rope Bow for shooting rope arrows into wooden surfaces... sound familiar?  Although Thief's rope arrows are less restricted and work more often.\n\nIt's no secret that this game relies entirely on its combat.  The plot and all of the dialogue are pure cheese.  It's cliche after cliche.  Character development is mostly non existent.  This is all intentional though, the game is not meant to have an enthralling story or serve as a drama of any sort.  It's just meant to provide a challenging but very fun killing experience.  It mostly does that, although its clunkiness and lack of polish makes it frustrating at times.  Plenty of times this game would get tiresome and repetitive, but then I'd unlock a new ability and all of a sudden it's fun again until I use that ability many times.\n\nTL:DR - This game is all about killing things and it has very good killing mechanics overall, the best on paper as far as action games go but the fact that it's somewhat clunky and very unpolished can make it annoying.  It's meant to be fun and challenging, and it mostly succeeds but with a number of hitches.  It drags on a bit and gets tiresome toward the end.  Decent game but would not play again, at least not entirely.\n\nI did not proofread this review.","September 15, 2015","true","28.1"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","37","42","3","0"

Few other medieval fantasy games have the amount of fluidity and control over a character's actions as DM does. Your character takes into account whether you are moving quickly, what direction you have moved your mouse, and how long you have pressed the attack button in determining what attack will be done.\n\nThe physics in the game are great as well. Ever wanted to kill a horde of orcs by only throwing crates and barrels at them a la Donkey Kong style? In this game, you can! Ever wanted to mess around for a while watching Necromancers play slip and slide on ice traps you've laid down? In this game, you can! Want to fight dirty and kick an enemy  off a cliff? In this game, you can!\n\nOther games such as Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim may have an open world with a more developed lore surrounding it, but they absolutely pale when it comes to their combat systems. Any person who has played Dark Messiah will agree.\n\nOn another note, this is still one of the few games in which you can enjoy a full view of your character's body when looking downwards. Games being made today still don't have this option, which is somewhat embarassing since this game had it implemented perfectly since 2006.\n\nLastly, this is one of the few games that genuinely feels as though you have actually taken down something massive and dangerous. The colossal size of some of the creatures, such as the wyverns and cyclops in this game, are genuinely huge, and require out-of-the-box strategizing to take down. For comparison's sake, I'll use Skyrim. Let's be honest, Skyrim's dragons are somewhat pathetic, if they seem to have trouble even dealing with common folk and can be taken down by common every-day arrows and fire spells. In DM, these creatures are actually quite dangerous, even towards the end of the game, and when you've killed a boss creature, you feel like you've earned it; it's an actual accomplishment that you look back on with pride.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to play this game.","February 20, 2014","true","23.7"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","2"

Imagine an RPG where skill progression doesnt just give you number increases, but tangible abilities, spells, moves and perks. Every encounter is like a battle arena sandbox with ledges, spikes, stairs, objects, oil jars, traps, and other things to exploit, you can play this game however you want, because xp (skill points) is awarded through progress rather than kill count, so stealth is viable. As you can see by my hours played, I can affirm to its play value, you'll want to try all the abilities in all sorts of combinations for sure.\n\nAll in all, its like oblivion/skyrim but linear and the combat is miles and away more fun (not a E.S. hater), and the perks and locals are far more fleshed out.\n\nPro tip: with all quests + or - side quests, you can get anywhere between 1 & 1/3rd to 1 & 2/3rds sections of perks filled between the 3 perk lanes (Warrior/combat, Magic, Stealth/misc.)","October 20, 2014","true","217.3"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","31","37","0","0"

Everything about it is so cool!  I'd place it near the pinnacle of first-person fantasy combat in all three archetypes: melee combat, stealth combat, and wizardry.  The movement is rather unique among fps games in that your character has weight that you can see and feel, and it makes you have to think as you move through combat.  Also, YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF; your body is rendered, and your choice of armor and equipment show.  It looks nice for an older game, and, since it is older, it runs beutifully on a new system.  The atmosphere is excellent, and the story is clever and well paced too.  You even have story changing choices!  Player agency!  I can go on and on about how much I love this game!  The environment is interactive.  The character progression is great, picking perks in the different archetypes: melee sword and sometimes board, Legolas archery, ninja stealth, and powerful sorcery.  You can specialize or mix and match to suit your playstyle.  This adds so much replayability.  I'm playing through again as a Wizard after a cool run as a Warrior type, and I'll go again.

The story is predicatable and cliché but not badly told.\n\nYou being the standard multi-talented rpg character can choose to become the most powerful (headless) warrior/mage/assasin of your time.\n\nSo why is the environment so good? Why would I reccomend this at least as much as the much smoother and more polished dishorored? Because you have one of the first games to try realistic physics and while it failed magnificently in some ways, it is still one of the best attempts going. Sure you kick someone within ten yards of a cliff/spikes and they go flying over it after tumbling forever and ever. But alot of objects can be played on both by you and the enemy, even combining in interesting ways with certain spells.\n\nOne of the nicest things that is so rare in games is that you REALLY feel different depending on what skills you choose. Stealth is ridiculously OP to the point of breaking the game at stealth 3, while magic only playthroughs are as challenging sub 10 deaths in super meat boy 106%.\n\nThe game is completely linear (which I like), even when you make a choice it barely affects any outcomes. Save this guy or not, heres a potion, or a sword, or a chance to kill the annoying one. The most significat differences are the 4 different endings and even there the actual difference is nothing at all, not even really worth exploring.\n\nThe enemies are one of the nicer parts, every enemy plays differently. Bigger, smaller, stronger, weaker, come in groups, come alone, have certain elemental weaknesses or can only be hurt in one spot. On the counter side the AI is stupidly exploitable, (this can be fun), but the hardcore player might be very dissapointed.","March 24, 2015","true","1.9"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","24","29","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfklebba/recommended/2100/","jfklebba","Ergaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfklebba/","247 products in account","Dark Messiah of Might & Magic is not a complicated or ambitious game, but what it sets out to do, it does very well... more or less. First, it should be said that like Crusaders of Might & Magic, this is not part of either of the two Might & Magic series (The strategy games and the classic RPGs). While it does take place within that continuity, it plays nothing like them. It does have a level progression system and character building, but more than anything it is a first person corridor shooter, just with swords, bows and magic instead of guns. In fact, the closest thing I can think of is Hexen.\n\nHowever, while the idea of a melee-oriented FPS may sound questionable (Although consider that Condemned: Criminal Origins came out around the same time), Dark Messiah's combat system is nothing short of fantastic, at least when swords are involved. I highly recommend that any potential players spec melee with just a bit of magic, as the sword fighting system is easily the best part of the game and is what the environments are designed for. Magic, particularly healing, is a nice addition, but focusing on it gets dull. Stealth is just tacked on and serves little purpose. In addition to a number of melee moves, Dark Messiah also features the fantasy version of Duke Nukem's mighty boot, and to be honest, this gets way more use than it should. This is because the levels are liberally covered with spike traps, long falls, fire, and so on that you can punt the enemies into. It's an absolute blast to send an orc falling to his death with nothing but a swift kick, but it does tend to be used far too much. This is because it kicking enemies quickly becomes the most efficient method of dispatching enemies, particularly when fighting a number of enemies in a closed environment.\n\nOverall, the level design is fine, if linear. At certain points, in fact, it could even be called inspired. Like the later Mirror's Edge, platforming is incorporated liberally, and also like that game, you can see the main character's body to help. Rope arrows help you scale the environments and contribute to the sheer numbers of ways you can dispatch your enemies. Towards the end, however, the action moves underground. At this point, most of the environments become incredibly boring, and due to the darkness, most of the game will be played through one of the most obnoxious night vision shaders I've ever seen. Also, while the combat shines when fighting humanoid enemies, this game is way overfond of spider levels, and these bounce between annoying and tedious, depending on how many poison curatives you have. No number of potions, however, can make these sections fun.\n\nThe story is entirely forgettable, with absolutely no outstanding characters. While there are multiple endings based on a particular choice, the logic of this choice is simply pathetic. The protagonist, Sareth, is accompanied by two female characters, a young mage and a succubus that lives in his mind, and his persona bounces between boy scout and creepy edgelord depending on which one happens to be the focus of a particular level. Literally no character in this game is particularly interesting or well developed, and the story simply serves to move the action forward.\n\nDark Messiah is far from perfect, but it has one reason to exist, and that's the combat. At times, the game feels like a spiritual successor to Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, and that's nothing but a good thing. It isn't as good as Jedi Outcast, but its as close as you'll come. Despite its many flaws, as a combat sandbox Dark Messiah justifies a place in any action gamer's library. However, it should be avoided if you want a well-constructed story, non-linear or open levels, or deep RPG mechanics. Make no mistake, Dark Messiah may look like its contemporary, TESIV: Oblivion, but the two couldn't be more different. Dark Messiah is a competent action game, and if that's all you're in the market for, I recommend it.","July 29, 2015","true","10.8"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","3"

So my review will be based on that.\n\nFirst of all, THIS GAME IS SHORT. You can probably beat in < 10 hours meaning one day of zoning out on the computer and bam, the final boss is down. The game is divided into 10 chapters with each chapter representing an area. Secondly, this game is as linear as it gets - there is an order for every place and you can't go back - just like FFXIII.\n\nThe leveling system is also a bit weird - everything is done in skill points which are obtained by going through the storyline. There are a few optional skill points as well - for finding secret areas or completing optional quests but those are few and far.  You determine your characters "class" by spending skill points.\n\nAnother thing to note - THERE IS NO TRADING. You can keep items in your inventory, use them, or drop them. That's it. The only healing you get is either through magic or healing items and mana restoration is only available via mana items which can only be found. So be very careful on how you use what you have.\n\nOn an overall note this game is different, it's short, linear, and kind of limited, but it was still fun to play. So if you are looking for something and this game is on sale for under 10 bucks then this may be the game for you.\n\nRATING: 6.5/10.","July 7, 2015","true","23.2"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","24","30","0","0"

It's a Source engine action RPG. Unlike the usual Might & Magic RPGs it takes a much more mainstream approach to just about everything and anybody that's play even a little of modern RPG's will quickly find themselves at ease with the simplicity of it all.\n\nGone are the exploration and everything else that made Might & Magic unique. Only the name and some of the lore remains. Not that I am completely opposed to ignore part of the Might & Magic lore, I was never that excited about the whole space aliens bit. Unfortunately this leaves the game feeling shallow. It's a game that saw what everyone else was doing and thought, "Hey, me too!".\n\nIn terms of gameplay Dark Messiah is the worlds most premiere kicking simulator. It's an odd thing really, Dark Messiah has weapons, skills and magic but you'll find yourself using nothing but your boot to dispatch the vast majority of foes. The harder the difficulty is turned up the easier and more tempting it becomes to kick your enemies into spikes and off ledges simply because it's an instakill maneuver more often than not and your weapons and magic will never be able to match it for damage except in that extremely rare location where there is no environmental hazards to kick enemies into.\n\nThe storyline is fairly decent, a little predictable at times but nothing worth complaining about. There is a pretend storyline choice or two that does have a little impact so that helps greatly.\n\nIn terms of graphics and sounds it's the source engine and that all comes down to style and Dark Messiah falls squarely into the "Okay" range. Nothing too impressive but nothing that'll ruin your experience either. You'll never be in awe of it but you'll never get annoyed with it either.\n\nThe multi-player component is fairly decent although it was always a graveyard so without friends it was impossible to play.\n\nBesides all the kicking Dark Messiah ranks as a not too bad game. It does nothing stellar, it doesn't even try to, but it does provide a decent enough experience that it's worth it to play through the once. And if you're feeling particularly feisty, you can challenge yourself by making a hard "No-Kicking" playthrough and watch the difficulty skyrocket.","November 25, 2012","true","55.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Immediately I was amazed at how fluid the combat felt for such an old game, even surpassing many recent titles of the past few years. You have different attacks for what you choose - magic, sword, staff, bow or daggers and each have their strengths and weaknesses. You can also block, do finishing blows and kick opponents into traps like fire pits, spike pits and off cliffs.\n\nThis is an Action-RPG in first-person perspective. You are within the Might & Magic universe and it is gloriously wicked. Fight spiders, skeletons, ghouls, goblins, trolls, orcs, zombies, dragons, demons. It is insane. Also insanely hard.\n\nYou earn skill points to spend on a skill tree, which is where the replayability comes in. There is no new game plus, however I highly recommend you focus on maxing one style of fighting that way you have a reason to play again. I am focusing on upgrading my magic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracaerys/recommended/2100/","Dracaerys","Night Druid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracaerys/","282 products in account","Dark Messiah of Might & Magic\nDeveloped by Arkane Studios, the game runs on a modified version of the Source engine; the famed engine that powered Half-Life 2 and its episodes. As much as the world of Ashan is fairly predictable fantasy fare, the game itself plays a lot like your typical Elder Scrolls game.  Physics-based environments are heavily emphasized - far more so than even Bethesda's Oblivion. The puzzles are far better implemented and occur much more often.\nThat said, beyond the physics, few other comparisons to Oblivion hold water. Unsurprisingly, Dark Messiah sticks to a fairly linear plotline. This is no bad thing since, in the space of twelve lengthy chapters, the pacing rarely wanes and you're never stuck pondering your next objective.\n\n\nStory:\nThe story explores the well-trodden, 'recover the mystical artifact for your mentor who may not be all that he seems' scenario. The heroic player, Sareth, is an orphan raised by the mysterious Phenrig. A magician who fuses Sareth with a decidedly kinky guardian entity, Xana, and vests him with a mission to recover te Skull of Shadows.\nOf course, like a good book, the story takes a turn for the worse for poor Sareth.\n\nThe Sareth/Xana relationship is pretty entertaining. She is effectively a jaded voice in Sareth's head, acting as an occasional hint-giver and guiding him on the path to his objectives. Beyond this, there's her oft-spoken allusions towards rewards of a sexual nature and her constant jealousy of Leanna a Witch in training. She is the obvious love interest whom you'll be spending plenty of quality time with by the end of the game.\n\n\nGameplay\nIt's not surprising in the slightest that the latest iteration of the Might and Magic series draws heavily from multiple sources both book and game alike.\nThankfully, the adoption of a first-person perspective makes for a wholly absorbing experience, and the clever integration of several different skills trees for each class and some unique gameplay features keeps Dark Messiah feeling fresh and genuinely exciting years after the games launch.\n\nPuzzles-wise, many of the game's more thoughtful and interesting moments are cleverly scripted. A rooftop chase sequence early in the game is fast and just precarious enough to be thrilling without becoming aggrovating. In pursuing a scurrying Gollum-like creature in pursuit of a key quest item, you have mere moments to scramble across awnings and through open windows in a deft combination of platforming skills and problem-solving.\nAutosaving is very well implemented too - saving at key moments to avoid bouts of severe frustration.\n\n\nMultiplayer\nIn addition to the single-player, there's a decent multiplayer mode to Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, and it's fairly different from the campaign. Here, you can choose from different character classes and go into battle via a few different modes. Deathmatch, team deathmatch, and capture the flag all work as expected.\n\nThe crusade mode provides a bit more depth than the other modes. This is a humans versus undead mode that uses respawn tickets and control points, similar to something like Warcraft's Arathi Basin battleground or Team Fortress 2's CP_Dustbowl gamemode. The game's multiplayer maps are connected in crusade, so if you win a map, you move one map closer to the opposing team's home base. You also gain experience points and levels in this mode, and each time you level up, you can assign skill points to enhance your abilities like World of Warcraft.\nYou can switch classes each time you spawn, so if you're tired of clashing swords as a warrior, you can switch to a more projectile-based character, like a mage or an archer. Priestesses can heal and resurrect players, and the assassin acts as a standard MMO stealth character. Experience points carry over from one map to the next, provided you stay connected to the same server.\n\nSadly, the only way to connect to servers nowadays is by inputing the IP adress into the command console using the "Connect" command found in most source games...\n\n\nVerdict: 9.4 / 10\nDark Messiah of Might & Magic is a decent game, it has awesome multiplayer and a decent story filled with content.\nIt may be completed in a matter of 6-12 hours, but the multiplayer is what has kept the game alive since Launch both on Xbox and on PC.","August 14, 2015","true","2.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Dark Messiah of Might and Magic does neither of those very well, and I doesn't need to.\n\nDark Messiah's strength is in its gameplay and level-design, its freedom of choice in the completion of challenges set before you. Dark Messiah sports possibly the best melee combat in any First Person game to date and supplements it with a wide variety of environmental interaction.\n\nImpaling your enemies on spikes, chopping their limbs off, burning them to a crisp or making them slip on ice, a smart player has full control over the battlefield. Every approach is viable, every environment suited to take on foes in different and interesting ways. You can master Archery, Melee, Stealth and Magic to become a force to be reckonned with.\n\nOf course nothing comes without flaws and with Dark Messiah it is unfortunately the engine which often crashes or produces (often hillarious) glitches. Still, if you are looking for a game that will challenge your creativity and mastery, this game is for you.\n\nIn the realm of content the game provides around 6-8 hours of gameplay time depending on how vigorously you explore the levels and their branching paths and secrets. The story, while nothing to write home about, with a twist telegraphed from miles away, is enjoyable in a corny adventure B-Movie way. Anyone that ever took part in a pen and paper tabletop will enjoy it as a throwback. Furthermore, it never gets in the way, the cinematics are kept to a minimum and never interrupt gameplay for longer than a couple of seconds. Dark Messiah is all about good old fun through gameplay, no carrots on a stick, no grinding and no pretension to be something more than it is.\n\nDon't be fooled, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic might be old, but it is classic worth both your time and the price of admission.\n\n---\nRead more game reviews, news and editorials at gatheryourparty.com","December 9, 2013","true","22.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's worth replaying the single player to explore the different skill trees, but multiplayer is pretty much not worth bothering with - it doesn't feel at all like the single player, which is pretty disappointing.

The ragdolls and physics are as you would expect from a game on the Source engine, with the added fun of dismembering and finishing off your enemies in a multitude of ways. The combat feels exceptionally satisfying, setting it apart from most other fantasy RPGs. Arkane's more well known (and more recent) title, Dishonored, is similar to Dark Messiah in a variety of ways, such as linear levels featuring numerous different paths to the same objective, adding significant replay value. A game worth your time if you enjoy action rpgs.\n\nFollow our Curator page : http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/ This review is written for : The Panda's Corner","December 10, 2012","true","42.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/venom517/recommended/2100/","venom517","Venom517","http://steamcommunity.com/id/venom517/","265 products in account","Dark Messiah of Might & Magic was a game I had played the demo for at roughly 10 years old. I passed so many hours kicking orcs off of high ledges in the sandbox area provided in the demo and finding it amazing how nice the game looked in comparison to Half Life 2. Recently, with some cash left over from the Winter Sale, I picked up a copy of it and spent two ~7 hour sessions playing through the entirety of the campaign and laughing my ♥♥♥ off.\n\nDescribing this game as an RPG feels somewhat disingenious, at least by my definition of an RPG. Those expecting a thorough, immersive high fantasy experience will (probably) be disappointed. If you're looking for some dumb, hack-and-slash, first person sword/magic combat, you'll get exactly what you want. Dark Messiah perfectly blends a mid-2000's E3 FPS tech demo and a hack-and-slash RPG. Kicking orcs, goblins, guards, and ghouls around is immensely satisfying. Hell, the sword-and-board combat itself feels nice and meaty. While I didn't focus on it too much, and only placed a few points into magic abilities, they do feel a bit lackluster, but Telekinesis is endless fun. Overall, the game makes up for its few faults by being immensely satisfying, fun, and rewarding\n\nA word of warning, however. While now nearly ten years old, Dark Messiah is admittedly dated. Running on the 2004 version of the Source Engine, (I believe, at least, I know that it certainly isn't running on the Orange Box engine,) patch after patch has made the game a bit unstable. I experienced about 15 crashes between these two sessions, but considering the game's now low requirements, getting back into the game is just a minor inconvenience, this along with the rapid climb in difficulty will ensure you're saving quite frequently. There are a few things that don't quite play as well as they did in the unpatched, 2006 version of the game, one of my major gripes being the few boss fights speckled throughout the campaign. Some of them just are not particularly fun from a gameplay perspective, but luckily are few and far between.\n\nAltogether, my run of Dark Messiah: Might and Magic came out to about 12 hours or so, playing on Hard. I imagine the game can range from about 5-20 hours depending on your difficulty and speed of play. Overall, if you enjoy physics combat gimmicks and kicking orcs off large cliffs, and generally just 'running up on fools,' and don't mind some early Source Engine jank, Dark Messiah is a game for you.","January 6","true","14.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flametrooper/recommended/2100/","Flametrooper","Jade.Wu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flametrooper/","190 products in account","Dark Messiah of Might & Magic is the epitome of what underrated games are. Arkane Studios did a fantastic job creating this game where you can choose between play styles such as mage, warrior, rogue, archer, and class combinations (archer+rogue or mage+rogue) depending on what talents you choose.\nThe overall story of DM is rather unique and is exactly what a fantasy story is meant to be with backstabs included for half-price and even cheesy romance. Many of the situations that the story will place you in are smoothly transitioned and are an absolute blast to play in. For example, in one level you awaken to soldiers invading your dwelling and kill the housekeeper who comes to warn you of the danger. This immediately puts you in a state of alert to fight for your life. That scenario is all done perfectly whilst blended with narrative that exquisitely blends what people want in gameplay with storytelling.\nCombat within DM is fun, what more can be said? Kicking. I could say kicking. But yes the kicking element of DM is absolutely amazing where you'll boot orcs off bridges miles in the air, sending them plummeting to their doom. The game could even teach TES game a thing or two about swordplay where you have to swing your blade PAST their guard. And while it'll be easy at first, it'll intensify against enemies that are far better at blocking and attacking. Magic is a fresh step in the right direction and it all feels right. Magicking and shooting a massive fireball feels good and so does zapping humans with lightning bolts. Likewise every other combat option is just as satisfying (such as bow&arrow where you have to aim a little above your target to get the bolt to aim true, also staves)\nThe graphics have aged quite well for this game and I've nothing bad to say of the soundtrack (or good in that matter).\n\nSadly the largest fault of the game has to be the lack of AI smarts in your oppnents AT TIMES. I think Arkane Studios did a great job at creating good AI, but if you happen to swing a large chandelier back and forth, you'll find enemies constantly killing themselves over jumping into an obvious death machine. I'd hope most people would agree that it's hard (if not impossible) to have designed an enemy AI over whatever is happening in the environment at the time of the game's creation.\n\nI'd heavily recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played this, it's enormous fun for the first run or two through.\n","November 30, 2013","true","33.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lumosx/recommended/2100/","lumosx","Lumos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lumosx/","12 products in account","Something for all your nefarious (kicking) needsI never knew this game existed until I found it by chance one day ago. Thought I'd pick it up, because it looked interesting, I gathered that the melee combat was good, and I'm currently very curious about first-person melee combat.\n\nNine hours later, it was already evening. I'd binged through most of the whole thing, and had to stop only because of biological needs and because my eyes were stinging. Rarely have I seen them be so bloodshot...\n\nThis game comes quite close to what I'd like to make, if I had a team of artists at my disposal. The graphics are very pretty, though of course, the game is ten years old at the time of writing of this review, and beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Still, the HDR lighting in particular makes an astonishing difference, and the whole things looks really nice at maximum quality.\n\nThe story is... adequate. It's certainly nothing groundbreaking, and I had a feeling that I've already played this game, despite the fact that I never have. That may have been a result of the story.\nIt's worth mentioning that this game feels like some sort of Tomb Raider mixed with the new Thief game (the one from 2014). The protagonist is a gluttonous kleptomaniac with a berry juice addiction, who spends most of his time raiding tombs. Aside from that, we've got demon kings, ancient artefacts, necromancer armies... and, of course, all of it ended with a dragon, as is standard for the budget fantasy genre.\nIt really does remind me of a budget fantasy film... But I really love that sort of thing, so I enjoyed it.\nI should also say that the "big twist" of the story actually caught me by surprise. I wasn't expecting that to happen.\n\nIt's also got a voiced protagonist (though no dialogue choices), something which I very much prefer, so extra points for that.\n\nThe characters are standard - nothing quite memorable in that department - and the voice acting is... delicious. It's not "great", but I like it. You can guess whether the character is good or evil based on voice alone. Ain't that a good thing?\n\nThe gameplay is quite interesting as well. The melee combat is quite well executed, though magic and switching between the two is slughtly clunky by today's standards (or at least my standards). As usual, the player is presented with different playstyle options: sword-and-board combat, archery, magic and stealth. However, you can always do all of them, and aren't necessarily limited to one, which is very nice - some situations are naturally better solved with some tools rather than others.\nI personally went for a build that emphasised stealth and marksmanship. They both start off pretty weak, but stealth ends up completely broken in the endgame (Remember Chameleon 100% in Oblivion, anyone? It's sort of like this, but with actual backstab mechanics that aren't dreadful).\nFurthermore, enemies are prone to parrying most of your swings and dealing too much damage to you, so direct combat is more effort than necessary.\n\nI can't not mention the kick. Kicking is your best friend, because of the point above, and because there's precarious ledges and walls of spikes everywhere. When it works properly, you can propel enemies backward, and literally send them flying. It feels extremely satisfying. If you like the power fantasy type of games - Far Cry 3/4's broken takedown mechanics come to mind - then you'll probably enjoy the combat here... Kicking, that is. Note that it's not as overpowered as the knife in said Far Cries, because you can still die in three hits, and your kicking stamina is limited, but it's still pretty enjoyable.\n\nThe sound is fantastic. Except the thundering footsteps that are loud even when you're supposed to be sneaking. But aside from that, I really enjoyed the sound. The ambience is very atmospheric when it wants to be, and some combat tracks were brilliant. Sounds in general were also on par.\n\n\n\nSome other things worth mentioning:\n- The goblins in this game are great, and I absolutely loved them. Their banter is hilarious, including the in-combat quotes, and slauthering them was so fun that I'm slightly worried to admit it. Unfortunately, there was too little goblins throughout.\n- The first-person full-body-awareness thing this game has going on is sometimes exceptionally glitchy, but it's not fatal. Still, it's a bit awkward to have your knees clip through your face when you're running up a steep staircase... but fortunately, that rarely happens.\n\n\nConclusion: May I have some more, please?Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is a well-made, if not very polished game. It's aged quite well (your opinions may vary), except a few things that I'd personally change, mostly related to the inventory.\nThe combat is satisfying, and the story isn't too bad. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would have very much liked it if additional campaigns or expansions existed.\nI thoroughly recommend it. It's worth at least a single playthrough, if not more, and the ratio of value to price is big. I got my copy for less than £3.50, so I can't complain on that front.\n\nFinal rating: 7.5 Pao-Kais out of 10 Pao-Kais.","April 21","true","37.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It's more like an FPS/RPG(I woudlnt say action rpg).\n\nLongevity and difficulty:\nIt does not take too many hours to beat it, but it's worth it. Play at very hard and i bet you won't survive. I tried it on hard mode, but you still have to limit yourself if you want your hard mode to be challenging.\n\nLimit yourself(a game is never too hard):\nSo if you want your hard to be hard, you should not unlock healself and do not use weapons that do exactly what a spell does unless you want to do a quick speedrun. At the very least, drop the ice bow and lighting shield.\n\nCombat:\nOne of the best combat system. The enemies and the ai are strong and smart enough to beat you in a duel. so imagine when 2 of them jumps on you. This forces you to sneak first before you engage. It forces you to use you spells strategically to kill a couple before you jump on the last few of the room to kill. Thus, it forces you to use your environment and front kicking your opponent on a spike like a mortal kombat's fatality. Speaking of fatalities, you will most likely kill your opponent with a fatal blow and you must build up your meter for that like a super meter from street fighter.\n\nStory:\nIl say it now, don't play for the story. The immersion is there and everything, but the story is not that good. The ending is one of the worse.\n\nVerdict: Buy the game. It's unique and this game probably influenced most first person slashing games after that.

A crossbow even more. If you use a shield ofcourse you can block - but hesterically enough 6 years prior to dishonored if you are using daggers or just a sword if you end up hitting at the same time; the same type of button mash prompt will apear to see who gets the "break" on the sword fight - ALSO same system is used to block an enemies weapon blows by hitting right click with a 1hsword / dagger by quickly parry blocking (same animation style as in dishonore) - Its basically Dishonored in the Might and Magic universe; without the ability to use the spell "Blink". :).

I'd say it's one of my favorite single player games. Yeah the storie's pretty generic and cliche (like, 95% cliche), but it's not bad necessarily. It's still interesting and far from dull. The melee combat is a lot of fun, especially for a game from 2006, and it still holds up today. The game's a little bit buggy at times but the only persisting issue is when you try to use the Rope Bow in small spaces, as it can make you glitch into walls. Magic seems a little underpowered, in my opinion, while the Warrior path seems quite overpowered, even on the Hardcore difficulty. Consider a bow-focused Hardcore Assassin playthrough if you want the most challenging of the three (or four) "classes". It's fairly long with a fun selection of weapons and a rather limited but sufficient choice in armor. AI's not super amazing but for a 2006 game it suffices. Overall, I wish the game got more attention than it did; it certainly deserved it, and the reviews are pretty unfair, in my opinion.","April 18","true","62.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can kick people into fires and watch as they struggle to limp over to a source of water before you kick them in and kill them while they're down. You can kick people into spikes. You can kick people into weak structural supports, causing barrels and boxes and whatnot to fall onto their allies, killing them.

Jumping back in, it certainly holds up, as it was fairly ahead of its time when it was released (in some ways more than Oblivion). Whether you are new to the developer Arkane, enjoyed their most recent game, Dishonored, or like me have been loving their style since Arx Fatalis, you will have a lot to enjoy for a low price.\n\nPROS: Graphics still looking fairly good thanks to the Source Engine, maxing out with ease on my modest rig. Enemy encounters are varied and enjoyable, plenty of options in how to take out baddies (magic, bows, blades, environmental kills). The story is pretty interesting and has pacing that keeps you engaged, taking you to some great locations. Large amounts of nostalgia if you've played before. Kicking an orc into an abyss is super satisfying.\n\nCONS: Scripted events can feel pretty obvious at times. Voice acting and characters are a bit cheesy (though I enjoy them). Combat is generally satisfying, but sometimes you don't connect when you feel you should. Weapon and enemy types are somewhat limited.\n\nOverall I'd rate this game an 8/10","May 31, 2014","true","1.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The graphics still hold up (well, mostly) to this day and the gameplay works alright as well, with some minor flaws. These flaws aren't actually flaws at all. It's just that we've been spoiled with games that do most of these 'flaws' better. For example, walking around, and especially jumping over obstacles, feels very wooden. Same goes for the combat. Switching between weapons and spells isn't as fluent when compared to, let's say, Skyrim. Now I can't fault a 6 year old game for not being up-to-date, but it does throw you out of the experience from time to time.\nI really should've played this earlier, because it was seriously pretty good.\nI do wonder if Bulletstorm got its inspiration from this game though... ?\n\n[Rating: 80/100]","March 18, 2012","true","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Contrived or overplayed story, yes.  And yet despite these "issues" the game is fantastic in that it provides an example of how to do hand-to-hand combat in such a way as to make it exciting, fresh and (somewhat) realistic feeling.  It adds a visceral quality and a creative mayhem.  Were the Elder Scrolls games or the Witcher games to draw on this game as their model for a good combat system then they would truly be the great RPGs that many (myself excluded) tought them to be.  Add the stealth component, the rope arrows (ala Thief) and the destructable / interactive environments and you get a wonderfully fun, gruesome medieval combat game with a well executed albeit predictable story.  Dishonoured is good but Dark Messiah is arguably a better implimentation from Arkane Studios.","January 24","true","27.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Back in the days, this title was a good example of a well-crafted action RPG created with Source Engine. It was both gameplay-rich and storytelling-wise, with a tech potential of the Source engine at it's finest for that time period.\n\nIt's not an open-world game, but it does give you a choice. You have a choice to craft your own hero, choosing your path through the storyline set in one of the HoMM worlds. You could become a powerful wizard and unleash doom at your foes or stick to the shadows and play with prey. Or you could pick an axe, and start to wreck everything in your way in blazing havoc. Choice is yours.\n\nI recommend this game for all fantasy fanboys out there because it's now the living classics and it'll totally be worth your time.

It won't hold your hand and you will start off under-powered and fighting uphill for a long while. However, this means that when you're hacking off heads left and right in the late-game and the characters comment on your growth in power, you actually understand what they mean.\n\nThe combat is one of the best parts of the game - the swordplay is fairly intuitive, the shield blocks effectively, and there's no weapon or armour degradation getting in the way of fun gameplay. Also, once you work out how to score a headshot with the bow, stealth attacks become fun and effective. Yes, there's a bit of kicking - kicking people off ledges or into spikes or down stairs, but I didn't feel I was oversaturated with this option and I felt that it aided me when I needed it.\n\nIt is, however, somewhat baffling that a game operating under the 'Might and Magic' umbrella railroads you into choosing the 'might' path over magic on more than one occasion. I feel sorry for the poor sod who threw all his experience points into spells, and then has to fight the orc warlord under the condition of 'no spells'. The fight is hard enough as it is without having to battle his 5 cronies at the same time while awkwardly switching from one spell to another as you can't equip more than one spell at a time.\n\nSimilarly, to utilise armours (of which there are 3 very specific types - warrior, stealth, and mage armours) the game forces you to level very specific traits up. Meaning that you are, once again, railroaded into making certain skill choices which makes you realise that the game would be the same if they'd simply asked you if you wanted to be a warrior, assassin or mage at the start and that the concept of organic skill choice in this game is mostly an illusion.\n\nThat said, I'm talking a lot about little niggly things - overall I had a lot of fun, and the game does allow a fair degree of freedom when it comes to your choices in the story, so I would highly recommend it, especially for a sale price.\n\nPROS:\n* Responsive and fun combat that utilises the environment well and genuinely provides a varied and free experience.\n* The texture detail is quite good and I felt the Source engine was used to good effect.\n* A story you can actually follow.\n* The difficulty can be genuinely challenging, forcing you to think rather than just hack about.\n\nCONS:\n* Occasionally frustrating platforming elements.\n* The characterisations of the women are grating, as they constantly fawn over you in what seems to be rather creepy wish-fulfillment for the developers.\n* Those that like to be a jack-of-all-trades will be disadvantaged.\n* The difficulty can be frustratingly punishing, resulting in multiple restarts because of tiny errors.\n","February 23, 2014","true","7.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

A title that flew under the radar because of the Might and Magic name. Too different for traditional RPG fans but action-adventure fans weren't lured either, thinking it's probably just another RPG.\n\nIt also suffers because the intro is extremely dark and the combat, while not overly complicated, does have a bit of a learning curve.  I think the opening tutorial might have turned off a lot of players right out of the gate.  However, once the main story begins the atmosphere of the game changes completely and draws you in.\n\nFun melee action or combo'ing spells with melee.  Tons of environmental use like kicking bad guys off cliffs or dropping stuff on their heads.\n\nIt's pretty linear but done the right way, including varied environments and mini bosses, and it's all tightly coupled to the story so you don't feel like you're playing just another filler level that pads the running time.\n\nGraphically the game is starting to look dated but required very high end hardware in its day to max out, so consequently still looks quite good on modern hardware.  At the usual $5 price these days it's definitely worth it.","November 28, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This sounds restrictive at first, but apart from the fact that you can play the entire game 3 times and get a totally different experience out of it every time depending on your class, you can also just distribute your level-up points in all three skill trees as you see fit and mix it up. Even for a warrior, it's pretty useful to be able to turn enemies against each other or to spot traps or hidden doors; Even for a mage, it's useful to do more damage with your staff or sneak around more effectively, and even for a thief/assassin, it's useful to be able to disarm enemies or create magic invisible fire traps.\n\nThe story is cool and intriguing with a couple of big optional choices and side missions that affect it, the locations beautiful and diverse (although the graphics are a little outdated, of course), exploration and sneaking fun and immersive, boss fights pretty unique and against several pretty BIG enemies, the RPG mechanics balanced and the fights badass and VERY satisfying - and this is the meat of the game.\nYou can disarm foes, dismember them, burn them, shrink them, zap them, freeze them, stealthkill them, kick them into spikes and fires or off cliffs or into other enemies and use the environement in all kinds of other creative ways (cut/shoot ropes to have large objects drop on or swing at enemies, or to collapse bridges or pillars to crush enemies, create fire arrows by simply holding an arrow into any fire, and shooting into oil puddles or at enemies directly - sometimes after you picked up an oil pot and threw it in their face for that extra-crispiness. You can of course use firespells for that, too.). The cool implementation of the environment into the combat always has you looking for opportunities at any location, which makes both planning fights from the shadows and thinking on your feet in hairy combat situations a lot of fun, and you feel like a proper badass after a huge fight that was so awesome that it could have been featured in a movie. This game makes you feel badass, and you feel like you EARNED to feel badass.\nEnemies include humans, goblin and orcs (warriors, archers or wizards of all sorts), zombies and skeletons, quasi-dragons, spiders, trolls and more, and they often require different tactics.\nOh, and you get *SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT, SORT OF (because you can set "change form" in the key bindings anyway)* the ability to turn into an "Alien"-like demon form later on, which I hardly used, but well, if you're into that sort of thing...*END OF ZOMG SPOILER*\n\nYou'll also do a lot of freeclimbing with the ability to grab ledges and the use of chains and ropes (You get Thief-style rope arrows later on, too!).\nAll of this in 1st person, which is very immersive and simply works well, especially since you have full body awareness, meaning the model that exists in the world is also the one you see from your perspective - and it throws a shadow. You're not a camera on a stick with fake arms on the side, you're ♥♥♥♥ing IN there.\n\nI was a bit disappointed in the MP back then because it was too fast for my taste (and in comparison to SP) and didn't have any objective maps - or co-op. No mods to speak of either, which is unbelievable for a somewhat unique gem like this, especially since it's a Source game.\n\nDark Messiah was made by Arkane, btw, who later made DisHonored. It is rather linear, so don't expect anything like Skyrim - but that's not a bad thing since Dark messiah is a different experience altogether, in a good way. It does have its flaws, but overall, it's a great experience.\n\nDamn, I just wanted to write a sentence or two... Anyway, I just installed Dark Messiah again to play through it for the 7th time (I think), despite having some awesome new games I haven't played or finished yet. That should tell you how much I love this game. :)","January 9, 2014","true","35.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is an action RPG that focuses on being smarter and more skilled than the NPCs. Sure, you could charge at an enemy and beat them to death with your sword; OR, you could shoot them with your bow, crush them with collapsable scaffolding, drop them down a pit, down some stairs, hit them with barrels, kick them into spikes, burn them, kick them into each other, or stab them in the back. The level up system is kinda lackluster, and does seem like it takes forever to get some useful skills. If you RPG damage sponges want a game that doesn't require much thought to play, by all means, don't buy this game. If you are looking for an RPG that challenges you on multiple levels and prefer gameplay to plot and VAs, give this a shot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SecretWizard413/recommended/2100/","SecretWizard413","Secret Wizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SecretWizard413/","172 products in account","The M&M series is primarily either an old-school, pen-and-paper style dungeon crawler, or a card game. Meanwhile, Dark Messiah is an oddity; it's a first-person action RPG in the Source engine, of all things! Picture Half-Life 2 with swords and sorcery instead of guns and robots, and you'll have a good idea of what this game plays like. Going into this title, I did not expect much. I knew it was from Arkane Studios, the same folks who delivered the excellent Dishonored, but all the same I was not prepared to fall in love with the game.\n\nThe Story\nMost certainly Dark Messiah's weakest aspect. You play as Sareth, an apprentice serving under the wizard Menelag. Your master has sent you to deliver some sort of artifact to a friend in a far off city, but has transported a woman into your conciousness to be your guide for mysterious reasons. Xana is pretty much a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Cortana from Halo. You'll either tolerate her character, or outright despise her. Once you actually get to your destination, stuff hits the fan and you're thrust into a campaign to defeat an evil Necromancer. There are quite a few plot twists along the way. The biggest will probably be obvious to you, but I can guarantee there are plenty of left-field ones. The question is... will you even care enough to, well, care about what happens? 6/10\n\nThe Gameplay\nAhhh, now here's Dark Messiah's shining beacon of awesomeness. I'm going to be blunt about this one, straight out of the gate: Dark Messiah has the greatest first-person combat I've experienced in a game. The guys at Arkane are wizards when it comes to first-person animations; everything is incredibly silky smooth and satisfying to witness and interact with. As you progress through the game, you'll be rewarded Skill Points which you can then distribute as you please through two skill trees. There's no skill that will drastically change up how you play; just some generic "More HP" or "Slightly Bigger Fireball". Still, it works. You can also get some skill points by finding certain secret objectives within the world.\n\nDark Messiah's level structure is not unlike Doom or Quake... Littered with clever secrets (Some I didn't find until my fifth or so playthrough!) filled with special loot like new armors and weapons. Using either a Sword & Shield, Dual-Daggers, Staves, Bows, or Magic, you'll slice and dice and stab and smash and burn and freeze and electrocute your way through hordes of Mercenaries, Orcs, Giant Spiders, Undead, and more. Though you can mash your attack button, that is rarely effective. The true combat is found using the various styles of power attacks. Not unlike the system found in Elder Scrolls, you'll preform different attacks based on which direction you are moving. From vertical swipes to long reaching stabs to hard-hitting slashes, you'll need to use every available move to defeat the very clever Orcs later on. Swords are nimble; the all-around weapon. They're capable of parrying foes, and you can even disarm by power-attacking while aiming at the hand. Daggers are lightning fast. They chop up foes before they can get a swing in, and they are capable of instant kills against unaware and fleeing enemies. Staves lack damage, but in smart hands they are the most powerful in the game. They can strike multiple foes at once, and blows to the head almost always stun instantly, leaving the foe extremely vulnerable to being kicked off their feet and into traps and the like. Bows work like you'd expect; headshots instantly kill unaware enemies. Once you get the skill that makes you draw faster and a secret unlimited quiver, it's possible to go bow-only, most definitely.\n\nMagic requires a lot of skill to use effectively. Sure, you have your standard fireballs and lightning bolts and freeze spells, but in my experience it is just too difficult to use solely these in combat. You'll need to be crafty; turn enemies against each other with a mind-control spell, shrink enemies to the size of mice, and lay traps near instant-killing spike-walls in the environment.\n\nAbout a third of the way through the game, you'll find the Rope Bow. Truly an inventive tool that I would adore seeing in another game. Near useless in combat, this weapon is instead used to navigate the environment; firing at any wooden structure above you will release a dangling rope you can climb and jump from! This one simple tool drastically changes up the level structure from there-on, and gives room for some dastardly secret nooks and crannies.\n\nAdmittedly, it does take quite a while to get used to how the game works. But I guarantee you... when it all clicks, you'll be saying "Holy smokes! This is gosh-dang-diddly-dum AWESOME!" 10/10\n\nThe Art and the Sound\nIf you've seen any sort of high fantasy movie, show, comic, or game, you've seen everything in Dark Messiah before. There's nothing visually that is truly original or outstanding. Admittedly, the super weapons later on have some great designs and one of the final levels is a big palette cleanser after hours of trudging through a boring ol' cave system. The environment, the enemies... it's all generic as possible. Thankfully, the sound is a fair bit better. The clang of metal against metal and swooshes of air as swords tear through it are top-notch and really bring a little extra bit of immersion. You'll probably get sick fast of the early Mercenary enemies who seem to always begin a fight with "Hey, pal!", but the later gruffness of Orcs and Goblins and the like feel a fair bit more threatening. 8/10\n\nThe Replayability\nBetween the many different styles of equipment available, the extremely harsh skill point limit, and the myriad of secrets to be found in every corner, you'll definitely want to play this beast more than once. The average first playthrough will probably take 12-15 hours. There are multiple endings, but trust me; you won't be replaying just to see these. The addictiveness of the combat is far more a reason to do so than the plot. 9/10\n\nIn Summary\nDark Messiah came out in 2006, and I played it in 2014. I was WOWed by it, and found myself playing it over five times before getting bored. I legitimately count it among one of my favorite games now. Well worth the low price of admission these days!\n\nStory: 6/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nArt and Sound: 8/10\nReplayability: 9/10\nTotal: 8.3/10","April 4, 2014","true","44.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It probably doesnt do the other Might and Magic games justice (I wouldn't know), but it is a solid game in itself with good melee combat (for me, probably the best yet), agreeable graphics and lots of fun places to explore.\n\nThe game lets you pick your own path and places to reach with its lovable rope-arrows, which -for those that have played them- works exactly like the rope arrows in Thief 1 & 2. The exploration is encouraged by the game designers and you will often find awesome stuff (like a homage to the Thief series as an example) lying about in crazy places.\n\nSo if you are an old Thief Fan that love exploration and getting to places you werent mean to be in(tm), this is probably a game for you. If youre just on the lookout for some fantasy melee (or range/magic) action with optional stealth, this is also probably a game for you.\n\nJust dont abuse the kick, it spoils the fun.","December 9, 2010","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a fantastic game where, when faced with several appointments at once, the primary factor in your survival is how foolhardy you are. Do you have audacity? Often it's your only chance, but it'll be your downfall too. To me, that's how being surrounded by a group of armed men should feel. Systematically killing them doesn't make sense - either you manage to immediately try to shift  the odds more in your favor somehow or you're dead. Throwing pots, ropes, kicking, pushing, trying  oh so desperately not to get flanked, other? I've only played two other games that are satisfying in this regard (on Hard at least). Dishonored (made by the developers of Dark Messiah) and Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. Winning when you're attacked by other players 3v1 in Chivalry feels absolutely fantastic. But anyways, as far as PvE combat goes, Dark Messiah is great. The story line isn't fantastic, it's not a free roaming RPG, and you might like to make more RPG choices.

Pretty cool game. It's not what you think it is. This is not an open-ended adventure game a la Elder Scrolls. This is an "on-rails" first-person hack-and-slash akin to Half Life.\n\nNot to say that's bad; it's just not what I expected. There's not a lot of exploring to do. Some, but not much. There are secret places you might not find, but they rarely contain anything really valuable (just a couple extra potions usually). The graphics are pretty, the combat system is really, really cool.\n\nThe one bad thing is that you spend in-game time to perform meta-game tasks. For example, the game doesn't pause while you're in your backpack or re-doing your hotbar. So if you get in a fight and that spell you want isn't already bound, you're taking some damage while you open your backpack and drag the spell's icon onto your hotbar.\n\nGood game, but don't expect Oblivion.

On the one hand, it has a nice combat system: making use of your environment and physics. On the other hand, and that's the more important part, because of its atmosphere and story. No other game or even movie could ever give me such intense feelings of solitude, claustrophobia and doom. The spider level was the most horrible experience of my gaming life. It's a great thing when a game can cause actual emotions like that in a player.","May 19, 2013","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story may not be that engaging, but the combat is fun and allows you to finish the game in a number of ways: you can either develop yourself as an assassin, a mage, just go for a hardcore berserker approach or develop for some sort of hybrid. The nice thing is that all of these feel like they are actually viable and fun options.\n\nThe game was based on the Source engine, meaning it also uses the physics made popular by Half-Life 2 to its fullest, admittedly even going a little overboard on it sometimes (or those orcs sure love having dem dere spikey racks all over the place).

I found myself running away from enemies all the time.  Seeing them at the end of corridors freaked the hell out of me.  I didn't have enough upgrades most of the time.  Enemies were too powerful.  At times, I thought maybe going on hardest was a bad idea.  I did finish it though.  At long last.  It felt great.\n\nThe settings were beatiful and you had that feeling of dread when you were near or in the presence of evil.  This is a really good but somewhat flawed example of a first person melee fantasy game.  Way better than any other game in its time.  it was too bad they didn't continue supporting this game like other Source Engine powered games.

The gameplay of Dark Messiah is the best in the entire library of rpg's, and the game rewards creative fast paced combat with tons of ways of hilariously killing your enemies. The storyline is good scripted, good voice acting and multi choice ending. It's in many ways better than Oblivion, Dragon Age and Mass Effect.

Magic is gimpy, and the most powerful tactic by far is kicking dudes into pointy things. However, the fact remains that no game has ever made first person melee combat feel so good or so smooth, not even zeno clash. It's also one of the few games that effectively combines action and stealth gameplay, so that both approaches seem worthwhile, even using both if you've spent your skillpoints appropriately. Just do yourself a favor and don't bother with hardcore mode. It makes all humanoid enemies and possibly spiders invincible unless you knock them down and hit them with a coup de grace, which makes combat incredible tedious.","July 3, 2011","true","28.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Magic is gimpy, and the most powerful tactic by far is kicking dudes into pointy things. However, the fact remains that no game has ever made first person melee combat feel so good or so smooth, not even zeno clash. It's also one of the few games that effectively combines action and stealth gameplay, so that both approaches seem worthwhile, even using both if you've spent your skillpoints appropriately. Just do yourself a favor and don't bother with hardcore mode. It makes all humanoid enemies and possibly spiders invincible unless you knock them down and hit them with a coup de grace, which makes combat incredible tedious.","July 3, 2011","true","28.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is an action RPG that focuses on being smarter and more skilled than the NPCs. Sure, you could charge at an enemy and beat them to death with your sword; OR, you could shoot them with your bow, crush them with collapsable scaffolding, drop them down a pit, down some stairs, hit them with barrels, kick them into spikes, burn them, kick them into each other, or stab them in the back. The level up system is kinda lackluster, and does seem like it takes forever to get some useful skills. If you RPG damage sponges want a game that doesn't require much thought to play, by all means, don't buy this game. If you are looking for an RPG that challenges you on multiple levels and prefer gameplay to plot and VAs, give this a shot. A good plot does not make a bad game better, but a bad story doesn't hinder a good game.","February 22, 2014","true","20.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SecretWizard413/recommended/2100/","SecretWizard413","Secret Wizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SecretWizard413/","172 products in account","The M&M series is primarily either an old-school, pen-and-paper style dungeon crawler, or a card game. Meanwhile, Dark Messiah is an oddity; it's a first-person action RPG in the Source engine, of all things! Picture Half-Life 2 with swords and sorcery instead of guns and robots, and you'll have a good idea of what this game plays like. Going into this title, I did not expect much. I knew it was from Arkane Studios, the same folks who delivered the excellent Dishonored, but all the same I was not prepared to fall in love with the game.\n\nThe Story\nMost certainly Dark Messiah's weakest aspect. You play as Sareth, an apprentice serving under the wizard Menelag. Your master has sent you to deliver some sort of artifact to a friend in a far off city, but has transported a woman into your conciousness to be your guide for mysterious reasons. Xana is pretty much a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Cortana from Halo. You'll either tolerate her character, or outright despise her. Once you actually get to your destination, stuff hits the fan and you're thrust into a campaign to defeat an evil Necromancer. There are quite a few plot twists along the way. The biggest will probably be obvious to you, but I can guarantee there are plenty of left-field ones. The question is... will you even care enough to, well, care about what happens? 6/10\n\nThe Gameplay\nAhhh, now here's Dark Messiah's shining beacon of awesomeness. I'm going to be blunt about this one, straight out of the gate: Dark Messiah has the greatest first-person combat I've experienced in a game. The guys at Arkane are wizards when it comes to first-person animations; everything is incredibly silky smooth and satisfying to witness and interact with. As you progress through the game, you'll be rewarded Skill Points which you can then distribute as you please through two skill trees. There's no skill that will drastically change up how you play; just some generic "More HP" or "Slightly Bigger Fireball". Still, it works. You can also get some skill points by finding certain secret objectives within the world.\n\nDark Messiah's level structure is not unlike Doom or Quake... Littered with clever secrets (Some I didn't find until my fifth or so playthrough!) filled with special loot like new armors and weapons. Using either a Sword & Shield, Dual-Daggers, Staves, Bows, or Magic, you'll slice and dice and stab and smash and burn and freeze and electrocute your way through hordes of Mercenaries, Orcs, Giant Spiders, Undead, and more. Though you can mash your attack button, that is rarely effective. The true combat is found using the various styles of power attacks. Not unlike the system found in Elder Scrolls, you'll preform different attacks based on which direction you are moving. From vertical swipes to long reaching stabs to hard-hitting slashes, you'll need to use every available move to defeat the very clever Orcs later on. Swords are nimble; the all-around weapon. They're capable of parrying foes, and you can even disarm by power-attacking while aiming at the hand. Daggers are lightning fast. They chop up foes before they can get a swing in, and they are capable of instant kills against unaware and fleeing enemies. Staves lack damage, but in smart hands they are the most powerful in the game. They can strike multiple foes at once, and blows to the head almost always stun instantly, leaving the foe extremely vulnerable to being kicked off their feet and into traps and the like. Bows work like you'd expect; headshots instantly kill unaware enemies. Once you get the skill that makes you draw faster and a secret unlimited quiver, it's possible to go bow-only, most definitely.\n\nMagic requires a lot of skill to use effectively. Sure, you have your standard fireballs and lightning bolts and freeze spells, but in my experience it is just too difficult to use solely these in combat. You'll need to be crafty; turn enemies against each other with a mind-control spell, shrink enemies to the size of mice, and lay traps near instant-killing spike-walls in the environment.\n\nAbout a third of the way through the game, you'll find the Rope Bow. Truly an inventive tool that I would adore seeing in another game. Near useless in combat, this weapon is instead used to navigate the environment; firing at any wooden structure above you will release a dangling rope you can climb and jump from! This one simple tool drastically changes up the level structure from there-on, and gives room for some dastardly secret nooks and crannies.\n\nAdmittedly, it does take quite a while to get used to how the game works. But I guarantee you... when it all clicks, you'll be saying "Holy smokes! This is gosh-dang-diddly-dum AWESOME!" 10/10\n\nThe Art and the Sound\nIf you've seen any sort of high fantasy movie, show, comic, or game, you've seen everything in Dark Messiah before. There's nothing visually that is truly original or outstanding. Admittedly, the super weapons later on have some great designs and one of the final levels is a big palette cleanser after hours of trudging through a boring ol' cave system. The environment, the enemies... it's all generic as possible. Thankfully, the sound is a fair bit better. The clang of metal against metal and swooshes of air as swords tear through it are top-notch and really bring a little extra bit of immersion. You'll probably get sick fast of the early Mercenary enemies who seem to always begin a fight with "Hey, pal!", but the later gruffness of Orcs and Goblins and the like feel a fair bit more threatening. 8/10\n\nThe Replayability\nBetween the many different styles of equipment available, the extremely harsh skill point limit, and the myriad of secrets to be found in every corner, you'll definitely want to play this beast more than once. The average first playthrough will probably take 12-15 hours. There are multiple endings, but trust me; you won't be replaying just to see these. The addictiveness of the combat is far more a reason to do so than the plot. 9/10\n\nIn Summary\nDark Messiah came out in 2006, and I played it in 2014. I was WOWed by it, and found myself playing it over five times before getting bored. I legitimately count it among one of my favorite games now. Well worth the low price of admission these days!\n\nStory: 6/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nArt and Sound: 8/10\nReplayability: 9/10\nTotal: 8.3/10","April 4, 2014","true","44.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may look a bit aged and the story is nothing to write home about, but it's still good fun.\n\nYou can make the protagonist Sareth a fighter, mage or rogue-type character, or a combination thereof. Depending on the skills selected, he will be able to use different equipment and/or spells. But for most of the game, the terrain and your right boot will be your most powerful weapons: kicking enemies into fires or spikes or off ledges is great fun and highly effective, as is getting them crushed by falling objects. While it might seem exploity, the environments are intentionally designed so you can decimate your enemies like this - and it still makes you feel like a clever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you do. The occasional boss creatures are also pretty cool. Levels are long and very well made, with plenty of secrets to find,\nThe only real downside here is that the fast attacks in close combat feel a bit lacking in substance.\n\nThe story is basically your standard "young apprentice ignorant of his shadowy origins embarks upon quest" type thing. It's not badly done but very predictable. What few narrative choices there are make next to no difference at all, choosing a different playstyle changes the game more.\n\nI cannot say anything about the multiplayer as I haven't played it, but I find the game to be worth getting regardless.","September 8, 2015","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What really makes this game stand out is the melee combat. I really liked how the attacks felt weighty and how attacking different body parts will do different damage and different effects towards your enemy, seeing your enemy get injured and hobble away and show that he is at low health was also lots of fun because a lot of games don't show you enemy opponents get injured by your attacks. Environmental kills were also really fun as you can kick your enemy off of cliffs, into fires, into spikes and traps etc, you can get really creative with how you deal with enemy encounters and watching the physics of the enemy's corpse as they fall down a cliff or some stairs is fun too, which is because it runs on the Source engine. There is many ways to mix your character's build with a mix of ranged, melee and magic attacks which adds replayabilty.\n\nThe designs of the world and characters is very nice, the game has a great high fantasy atmosphere that feels like real lived in world. Despite being an older game it has aged nicely in this regard.\n\nThere are multiple endings which offers replay value and adds weight to the story as it feels you can choose to be the good guy or the bad guy, which was interesting while the story itself was a bit cliched. The level design is quite linear and at parts could get a bit annoying with backtracking but the way you can build your character adds replayability to the fun combat that you'll want to play again, as you try different strategies. Overall an underrated game in the Might and Magic universe that really stands out due to its fun combat system and kicking things.","April 7","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For an old game it has very nice graphics, interesting storyline and awesome gameplay. The combat system is really fun, especially with kicking. The game invites you to use the environment around you to your advantage, rather than just sticking to the usual combat methods. Plus it's always hilarious kicking enemies off the ledges and watch them fly XD! The other thing that is really awesome is the exploration element, there are some not-so-obvious places that you can get to find secret areas which most of the time contain very rewarding treasures.\n\nAll that being said, I really wish that the game was longer, I felt it was way too short and too linear, I think it definetly deserves more. Also there are a couple of annoying glitches that are not patched, they are not game-breaking but very annoying. I would like to try the multiplayer but there doesn't seem to be many that play the game anymore.\n\nIn the end, it's a very fun game and an awesome experience, I highly recommend it.","April 5","true","40.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a entierly new game. Everything from the universe to the genre is completly changed.\n\nThe game plays very much like Dishonored, as Arkane studios is the developer of both games. (*cough* also a bit like the recent theif 4 game as edios kind of ripped of about everything, and then dumbed it down*cough*). This means that you can play the game like you want to play it, you can go about any problem your own way, be it sneaking, backstabbing the crap out of everything, to just improvising and just throwing random props you find on the floor. Or maybe you go about it with magic or raw strength\n\n\nThis is NOT an open world rpg, and it does not try nor need to be. Much like dishonored the "maps" are open linear. It is a big, well designed map (that you will not find in any openworld game as it would take to much time to design), that has lots of thoughts behind it, with loads of variety. The levels can be explored and very often interacted with. I often find myself drifting around, looking for secrets, or new ways to kill enemies. "humm that 12 meters statue looks fragile, maybe i can destroy... OH GOD ITS FALLING RUN!!". Some parts inbetween levels are linear, be it jumping between rooftops in a frantic chase, it still feels authentic and as if it has a part in the game.\n\nThe niche of this game is the phisics. Be it kicking people into spikes, throwing barrels, kicking orcs of clips you name it. Combat is fluid, active and varied. The enviroment is a weapon that you will need to use. There are lots of diffrent weapons, with diffrent "enchantments". The combat is not only skill in the heat of battle but also choosing the right tool for the jobb, as using a firesword to hit a demon is not the greatest idea. in other words use logic when choosing weapons.\n\nAs far story goes, you are Sereath accompanied by Xana (the weird sarcastic woman stuck in your head), trying to find the skull of shadows, an ancient artifact, part of the legend fortelling the doom of mankind "something something".\nThe story is fairly predicteble, but nonetheless worth experiencing. It's not bad because even though the story is a classic cliche, it is well executed. Just dont expect a bioshock infinite.\n\nThis game remains to date, as one of my favorite games of all time. Good work arkane studios!\n\n","February 27, 2014","true","51.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Most people only know Arkane Studios for Dishonored, possibly without even realzing that Dark Messiah still influences things to this day, like the Deadly Reflexes mod for Skyrim, because its combat was so fun that very few other games have managed to match it.\n\nThe game uses the Source engine's physics in the combat arguably better than even Half Life 2 itself did, letting you pick up almost anything in the environment and throw or kick it as a weapon, use telekinesis magic to turn anything from flaming corpses to pies into projectile weaponry, smash environmental traps to send things falling onto enemies, and of course the ever-famous kick, allowing you to stagger and kick your enemies into environmental hazards or off cliffs. Along the way you can put skill points into buildling your character for stealth, magic, or standard combat, each of which are equally fun and viable. The story isn't really its strong point, but you'll be too busy kicking things to care much. If you liked Dishonored and you haven't played Dark Messiah, you should probably fix that.","April 11","true","34.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The entire gaming community online was going bonkers with this game, the demo that had been released roughly a year prior had been completely broken down.\nIt was hacked and people discovered loads and loads of hidden features and at that point unused enemies that had giant errors as skin. Everyone was waiting, including me,  and then at the day of release....Nothing, no one bought it, review sites gave Dark Messiah a horrible rating calling it less than average.\nMe and a friend of mine were even the first people to buy it in our country, the game sales guy was shocked that we were the only 2.\n\nAnd now, after so many years, it still recieves horrible reviews from critics, but I'll step up to defend it. LEt's just go over it point by point see where and how they are wrong.\nThis review will contain spoilers but I highly recommend it if you haven't played it yet.\n\nFirst off, the Story.\n-------------------\n\nPeople say the story is transparent, why? Because the game is called Dark Messiah? Or how about that first cut scene, you know where you actually SEE the ending in a dream.\nI never can understand why anyone would say that, the game never tries to fool you.\nOthers might say that there really isn't much story to begin with....which is also false.\nMost of the story actually lies in the past, things that have come and gone already, I think it has enough depth.\n\nGameplay\n-----------\n\nI've heard more than enough times that the combat is repetitive, but I don't understand why.\nThis is where Dark Messiah excels , never not once in playing it have I gotten bored during combat, fighting enemies is never the same. On the highest difficulty setting fine you know, yes the enemies have some really cheap hits, that do a heck amount of damage. But I never saw it as unfair, only that I had to be better, faster, more cunning and slippery.\nEverything is a weapon, going from a big Wooden Barrel, to a bucket of plain rocks.\nOften I found myself actually reloading a certain fight scene when it went to EASY, killing 5 vampire knights without any damage....no that didn't do it for me, so I did it again and after 40 retries I finally succeeded again.\n\nAnd the kick, nothing beats that, if there's a ledge someone is going down, and it never gets old.\n\n\nRPG or Not?\n-------------\n\nI wouldn't call Dark Messiah an RPG, persé. Howeverit does have RPG elements. But you don't gain skill points for killing enemies, and there's no class system.\nMost people really hate that about this game, but I don't. At least it's a refreshing take upon the genre, just build your own class. And if you don't have enough skills to finish your end goal...well you screwed up not the developers.\n\nThe only thing that I kinda don't like is the fact that in a way you are forced to have at least 1 magical ability.\n\n\nEnding Good or Bad\n---------------------\n\nThere's only one true ending, and that's the evil ending. The game is called Dark Messiah, the ending is shown to our protagonist in the beginning in some sort of vision. Even the crew of Might and Magic themselves kinda admitted to which was the real ending when they included good old Kha-Beleth in the series.\n\nAgain a refreshing take, not everything has to be sunshine and lollipops with rainbows.\n\nFinal score I give it a 10/10, play this, love this and enjoy this.\n","February 10","true","22.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Let me start with the story. You take the role of Sareth – an orphan who is train by the wizard Fenring. Years goes by and finally our hero is tasked to deliver a crystal to another wizard named Menelag in the city of Stonehelm. But before you leave master Fenring summon a woman name Xana, who will be your guardian and she settle in Sareths head. When you're getting closer to the city you see people leaving because army of Necromancers are about to attack. And they do and Sareth saves the city … for now. After the battle you meet Leana, niece of Menelag and the wizard himself. Sareth goes to sleep and in the middle of the night he is attacked and here start your adventure. The story is the big minus of the game – it is so predictable. The other thing is the stealth. There is no point of using it, which is a shame, but game is design  around to fight, not to sneaking.\nThere is some rpg in DMOM and it's not deep. You earn skill points by doing tasks and you distribute them in three categories. There isn't big skill tree and some people won't like it, I personally don't mind that much. It would be better if the developer put little more variety in the skills.\n\nThe combat is what I like most. It's is somewhat repetitive, but awesome. At your disposal they are swords, bows, staffs, daggers, shields, magic all their pluses and minuses. When clicking the left mouse button you perform normal weak attack, but if you hold it you execute power strike, which do more damage and depending of your movement the animation is different.\n\nWhile battling the enemies adrenaline meter is filling. When it's full you can kill enemy with one hit and it is gory. Lets not forget the mighty kick. In a lot of cases enemies will stand near a cliff, fire, spikes and you give them the boot it's instant death.\nThe magic spell are nothing new or exiting. You can freeze, shoot fireballs, lightnings. The most useful spell for me is Charm. There is nothing more satisfying of making group of enemies killing each other.\nThe level design is great. You will walk in to caves, island full with ruins, sewers, castles. Exploration is rewarded, they are a lot of hidden stuff.\nThere is a decent variety of enemies, but their design is generic. You will encounter humans, orcs, dragons, goblins, zombies, spiders, cyclops and the most annoying enemy – ghouls. Most of them has some weakness, but not the ghouls. They are just annoying.\nThe game is hard. If you walk right in front of more than two-three enemies, most likely you will die. Use the weaknesses, set some explosive traps.\nDespite some shortcomings DMOMM is good game and I definitely recommended it.","October 24, 2014","true","20.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

I liked how varied game they developed - you can be a master of swords or become an archer or simply stick with magic. There are a lot of traps here and there which means the game lets you use the environment to kill your opponents. For example: you kick a support beam after which a dozen barrels are dropped on your enemy. Or you can sneak up to those standing near cliffs and kick them down into the abyss. This environmental combat is what makes Dark Messiah a unique game. Looting exists but you cannot really equip that many weapons - it is as if the creators wanted to put the system there as it was a requirement for an RPG anyway.\n\nPutting the insignificant looting system aside Dark Messiah is a very good fantasy game.

The first person sword fighting is good, satisfying and possibly the best of its kind (haven't played Dishonored yet). There are some issues with hit detection, and Flurries (your main attack, but you'll probably be using power strikes most of the time) is pretty crap, but apart from that the melee combat is done pretty well and has a good sense of impact and physicality, whether you're blocking a strike with your shield or kicking an enemy. The RPG elements, which let you use magic and stealth as well, and environmental weapons (wall spikes, fires, flimsy wooden supports that can be broken to topple barrels and crates on enemies etc.) allow for different approaches to each battle. The platforming is also decent.\nThe game isn't perfect of course. Some sections of the game don't cater well to a specific build, boss fights are dull and in some cases (usually when they fly) annoying, and some of the enemy types aren't nearly as fun to fight as others. There have also been complaints about the plot, characters and voice acting, but I wasn't bothered by them.\nBasically, if you're looking for good first person sword fighting and physics in a fantasy setting then Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is the game for you.","December 30, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clairne/recommended/2100/","clairne","fista1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clairne/","43 products in account","This game has the best combat system I've ever seen. You can use the enviroment to help you in combat. For example you can trigger traps, throw objects on your enemies, or kick them to water/from stairs, impale them on spikes, or climb above them and shoot them with your bow. As assassin you can hide in shadows and backstab your enemies. As wizzard, you can freeze your oponents, make them smaller or cast ice on earth and watch them as they slip on ice. You don't have to learn skills from one class, so you can learn anything and become anything you want. Some people say that it's useless to learn some skills, because the kicking is the most powerful weapon in game. It's not true. It's more effecient to be for example  assassin(and of course, it's more fun).\nGame is linear, you cannot stray, but there are four different endings.You have been possessed by a demon which will help you and say funny comments on some situations in the game(and she's got sexy voice). The story is simple but good. The maps are very well designed. The atmosphere is different from location to location. Somewhere it's peaceful, elsewhere it's calm, or dark, or little disturbing.\nThe game is from 2006, but still good looking. Textures aren't high quality, but the illumination is perfect and enhance atmosphere. Music is mix of orechstral and industrial, someone can say it's dark fantasy.  You can find soundtrack on youtube. Sounds are average. Water sounds like water. The characters have very good voices, even the supporting characters. There are also ambient sounds. There are very good and further enhance the atmosphere.\n\nDark Messiah is the most underrated game I've ever played. It definitely should have second part. I played this game three times and it's still fun. There was still places that I didn't see in previous playthroughs.\nMany people were dissapointed becasue they thought Dark Messiah is RPG. It's not. It's action game with RPG elements.","March 31, 2013","true","12.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Futhermore, the story is told pretty well, but it references some Heroes of M&M V characters and events, making it possibly a little confusing in terms of who-is-who.\nAll in all, I found the game to be quite amazing.\n\nSo why only 8/10? Because of the bugs that still exist and that will likely never be fixed. I experienced nothing game-breaking, but it ranges from nuisances (i.e. the game crashes everytime I quit for me), over bothersome things (I had for instance some common shield in my inventory I could neither use nor drop, thus it just blocked one slot in the inventory), to real bugs (example: somewhere in chapter 9, you have to jump into water in a rather dark tower. For some reason world reflections caused the entire screen become white and the game was unplayably slow. I had to turn off reflections to see anything and to be able to play again).\nNeither of those bugs is a real deal breaker, but the amount and versatility of them is truly annoying.","January 5, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

It was one of few linear games that never actually felt linear. The environments were all diverse enough to feel fresh (the orc village in particular was fockin' AWESOME!) and there were enough enemies to make it feel varied as well, without ever feeling convoluted. You had complete and utter freedom over how to "train" your character, i.e. picking skills, and basically every single "build" in the game was viable if you knew how to use it.\n\nStealth was satisfying enough to warrant sneaking through entire levels at a time, and combat was also satisfying enough to go chopping off heads left 'n' right with your new +5 Earthfire Sword. Magic had a LOT of fun spells (chain lightning, anyone?) and very few uninteresting ones, the only real exception being Sanctuary, methinks. Hell, even Weaken was fun at times! Granted, mostly when the adrenaline was a-pumpin', but whatever. So, the inevitable question. What is my rating? Well, DM-M&M wasn't perfect, but I'll be damned if it didn't do exactly what it was meant to do: deliver one helluva story with some helluva gameplay! 8.6/10","February 23, 2014","true","31.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #38 - Dark Messiah of Might & Magic\n\nI played a number of the very early Might & Magic Games.  In particular I remember playing a ton of Might & Magic VI.  I remember it as a role playing game before the Heroes of Might and Magic series overshadowed it with a completely different type of gameplay and focus on strategy.\n\nDark Messiah of Might and Magic is a different beast altogether.  It's not a turn based strategy game like Heroes is.  But it's also not an RPG like the original games either.  This is more of an action RPG, with an emphasis on the action.    You do have some RPG aspects, for example the game provides 3 skills trees, one for melee, one for magic, and a third for other skills.  The early skills are cheap, so it's easy to dabble in each of the skill trees.  I found this to be good because I was primarily focusing on melee, but early on I found it extremely helpful to train a heal spell.  I noticed I wasn't really healing on my own, but I would slowly get mana back, so being able to trade mana for health made things a lot easier.\n\nEven with the skill tress and RPG elements, I still consider this game pretty RPG-lite.  If you are looking for an open-world type game, this isn't for you.  The story is linear and really the game feels more like an adventure game with an emphasis on combat than a typical RPG.  This may sound like a turnoff, but the combat is actually a lot of fun.  I really liked the feel of combat.  It isn't just smashing buttons or turning on auto-attack.\n\nAnother nice aspect to this game is the interactivity with the environment.  The game encourages you to kick the crap out of your enemies, either into a fire, or into a convieniently placed spike rack, or over the edge of a railing.  In fact arguably your foot is the best weapon in the game, at least from what I saw.\n\nProbably the most fun I had in my hour of play involved a chandelier.  I cut a rope which caused this chandelier to start swinging around.  Meanwhile I had about 4 guards chasing me.  I'd run past the chandelier while it was on it's upswing, and the guards would stupidly follow me without paying attention and get smacked as the chandelier came back down.  It was kind of ridiculous as I'd watch the guards body ragdoll it's way across the room as if it was hit by a wrecking ball.  After about 3 laps around the room, I had killed all of the guards by chandelier.\n\nMy only complaint about the game was it was rather crash prone.  It crashed 3 times on me in the hour I played.  Once it crashed on startup, once it crashed as I was quitting the game, and once it crashed in the middle of the game.   Perhaps this is from me running Windows 10 (the game came out for Windows XP).  Looking at other reviews, this doesn't seem to be a common issue, so it may just be something specific with my setup.\n\nOverall, the combat alone is enough to make this game fun, and to earn my recommendation.  I did not check out the multiplayer version of this, so my entire review is only based on the single player game.","October 28, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You are tasked to deliver a mysterious artifact to a guy who then dies, like, a few hours later. His hot niece, who totally has a crush on you, helps you retrieve the artifact from the bad guys. She dies. Or she doesn't. Anyway, in order to get even, and fulfill your destiny, you must find and use a skull. And then you die, but not really. Because your conscience, which also totally digs you, brings you back to life and triggers your mega-evolution. You can continue on the pokemon path, or choose to cleanse yourself of the annoying voices in your head, and then you get some hot lewt good vs undead. You kill some more guys, and then another guy, and then you can choose to either watch a cutscene, or the other one.\n\nBut srsly, I recommend it with all my limbs. If you haven't tried it before, you will notice similarities with Arkane's previous first-person slasher, Arx Fatalis. But with more emphasis on melee&ranged, and a simplified magic system. It features some damn awesome melee combat. Slashing, backstabbing, kicking, is just too damn fun. Also connects with the HoMM series (5th), but I won't say how because spoilers.\n\nI give it a 9.75/10, but only because it makes me want to backstab people while walking down the street.

It's basically a first person shooter, except medieval, so they had to do a lot of work on making melee combat interesting. They largely succeeded, honestly. It is totally fun to kick dudes around and into spikes and off cliffs, and the first-person movement and combat all looks and feels really good. It was an early Steam game, though, and people didn't like Steam, and there were issues with the multiplayer, and the voice acting and the plot are TERRIBLE, though, so it's sorta been forgotten.

For example, staffs are great at the beginning, but they require magic affinity later on.  Eventually, they're awful since enemies move way too fast (such as ghouls and vampire knights), so those magic affinity points are wasted.  You don't really need them even for casting spells since mana potions recover mana at a fixed 50 mp/potion.  Daggers are the weapon of choice later on, but early on, you really can't assassinate everyone, especially when playing on hardcore.  Going stealth really doesn't yield many combat options aside from equipping stronger daggers and armor, but later on, you don't care anyway since you're just slashing like crazy to land hits on those fast enemies anyway.\n\nArchery's mad weak.  Don't even bother going for headshots.  They don't count.\n\nMagic is only good in the mid game.  In the beginning, spells are too weak.  In the end, they're strong, but only against individual enemies which means it doesn't help against packs (until you unlock inferno and sanctuary which are way OP, but only if you land the initial hit.  If you miss, then you might as well just reload your quicksave since you'll be dead before you know it).\n\nThe story's kind of interesting.  It makes you really think about good and evil since the plot isn't straightforward.  Good guy orcs that fight against not so bad demons is a neat angle, and in between is a powerhungry necromancer leader who's trying to stop a prophecy from coming true.  You can really think about why you're doing what you're doing.  The story never really explains why your father is locked away by dragons either, and it makes you wonder if his "demonic" heritage is only opposed based on what he looks like.  There's no real indication that the demons did anything "bad" to deserve getting locked away.\n\nAlso, the rope bow gives a lot of exploration options, and combined with the burglary skill, you can find a lot of helpful loot.  Actually, you'll end up throwing a lot of gear away just to make space for future discoveries.\n\nThe game seems to offer the chance to play through in many different ways, but ultimately, you really can't.  You use staffs in the beginning, daggers later on, and a few support spells (freeze, charm, and heal) to carry you through...\n\n...and all the while, kicking enemies off a cliff, into a fire, or into a wall of spikes is still your coup de grace.","May 12, 2014","true","43.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I will be updating this review to talk about the game itself later.\n\nI'm on Windows 10, 64 bit, and this is a pretty old game!\n\n- Game often force closes when loading a new level. Quitting the game also makes it think it has force-closed. Enemies spawning also seems to cause crashes on occasion.\n- The "rope bow" can create ropes that stick you into walls. Having two ropes next to each other can make it incredibly diffiucult to dismount the ropes and get on the ground. Save frequently (F6 is quicksave)!\n- When trying to stay afloat among some rising water, the character makes some horrible drowning noises. Pretty grim! Minimise them by aiming upwards and holding jump.\n\n\n- There are three difficulties: Normal, Hard, and Hardcore. I opted for Hard. The game starts off incredibly difficultly, but it quickly teaches you how to use footwork and the environment to dispatch your enemies. Unfortunately, you can be faced with a large room filled with multiple guards, and by far the easiest way to kill them is to use the environment (in this case, there was a chandelier which killed them in one hit). You get some more armour, weapons, and skills, and the game difficulty is bearable, and you're able to use your sword. However, there are some escort missions, and when you come across the orcs they can kill you (and your escortee) in one or two hits, if you're unlucky. You can change the diffiuclty mid-game by using the command line, e.g. to switch to Normal mode, type:\n\nmm_game_easy_difficulty 1\nmm_game_hard_difficulty 0\n\nOr set the game to start with the parameters:\n+mm_game_easy_difficulty 1 +mm_game_hard_difficulty 0","March 3","false","19.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bushmoinc/recommended/2100/","bushmoinc","Uncle Hammer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bushmoinc/","244 products in account","Posted elsewhere in 2010, since I revisited this game recently, I feel the need to post this here.\n\nDark Messiah could have been an excellent (though still extremely linear) game. For one, the game's combat is probably one of the best uses of melee combat in a FPS, with excellent hit detection (but still not perfect) and combat that puts lots of importance in good use of the environment. It works for a bit, but then after a while something simply feels off and it does get boring if this isn't the first game you have ever played.\n\nThe game gives the illusion of having varied way of playing through it. The warrior, mage, and assassin archetypes are all present with the addition of archery. Now these "classes" aren't static in anyway as you don't pick who you want to be at the start of the game. Instead you are awarded character points for completing objectives with which you are able to allocate to three different character traits: combat, magic, and "other" (which consists of stealth skills, stamina and mana boosts, etc). Because there are a finite number of character points available, you will need to place these points in each category with care, as being a generalist in this game will simply make it much harder. However, the care needed to put points in some categories is further increased due to the simple fact that many of the skills and the ways of approaching this game are simply a waste of time (in that they are useless) or are completely un-entertaining.\n\nAn excellent example is in the "stealth" route of character creation. For one, the game is far too linear for implementing any real semblance of "stealth" game-play, and the only real use for stealth is for scoring one-hit kills on unsuspecting enemies (which are great, because after playing "through" this game many times, sometimes it is nice to be able to avoid a drawn out confrontation). The problem is, there are very few hiding places and opportunities to use stealth, because even if there are shadows to hide in the place usually is very narrow hallway. If you have some space to maneuver, the places are usually very well lit and makes it hard to sneak anyway. In all, putting any points in this skill is an utter waste simply due to map design.\n\nArchery, like stealth, is also unsatisfying and character points are best spent elsewhere. Unless when used in conjunction with stealth, arrows do very little damage, and you will only be able to get in two, maybe three, shots in before the opponent is in your face before you need to switch to a weapon with the ability to block with. Sounds easy, but switching weapons requires a lengthy withdraw from sheath animation and by the time you pull your weapon out you already lost lots of health in the mean time. Granted, this danger could be avoided if you pull out your weapon earlier, but that would sacrifice the ability to fire more than once… so in the end, really, there is no need for archery in this game unless certain things were tweaked.\n\nThe tweaks about to be mentioned would also benefit melee combat as well, as using a sword/staff/daggers (why are daggers in fantasy games always in pairs?!) because combat in this manner also suffers from issues.\n\nWeapon damage in this game is too flawed. Quick strikes simply do no damage at all, now it does make sense they are weaker than power strikes, but hacking an enemy in the face should at least some effect. As a result, there is no reason to quick strikes, and you'll mainly rely on strong strikes and kicks, neither of which do any real damage either. This simply makes the game an especially grating experience on harder difficulties as you receive far more damage from attacks but still inflict very little unless you use power strikes, but being extremely slow, you'll get hit many times before you can strike yourself. This could have been easily remedied with a sidestep or back dash system of inputting a direction twice and quickly hopping in the direction at the cost of a fair portion of your stamina. You know, spice up the combat, something this game needs. This is where more flaws come in, the power attacks only come in two or so animations in a game with pretty precise hit detection this is an awful combination.\n\nThe weapon swings in a set path, and with it the camera jolts with the swing, the result: you have very strange attack animations, with limited functionality in battle as the swing arc is a such a strange plane it will often miss your intended target. It is really hard to accurately portray this, but if you were to pick up a staff (the "crowd control weapon") and use it's power attack, you'll see first hand by what is meant by attacks being unresponsive. What could have remedied this would be a simple directional input plus attack button scheme which would result in a different kind of attack. Step to the side for a sweeping attack, forward for a power overhead strike, back for a stab attack; you know to spice up combat and do it in a logical and intuitive manner.\n\nBlocking is yet another sterile facet of combat. It is always the same animation, and it is uninteresting to perform (though in dispensable). What could have been done to make it far better is incorporate better animations, maybe more depth to it (like needing to block directional attacks) and adding the ability to actually parry attacks. How that would work would be simple (and intuitive) like the directional attack idea: direction plus block button when timed versus an attack would bat away an enemy attack allowing for you counter attack with your weapon or kick. I believe this feature and the directional attacks had they been included in this game, Dark Messiah's combat would have been epic, but alas, innovation isn't attempted nearly often enough.\n\nKicks are a great tool and are probably one of the highlights of the game. They allow you to clear paths, kick enemies off ledges or into spikes and fires, and break through an opponent's guard. But since swinging your weapon is either too weak or too slow, so the last example is, for the most part, pointless. In fact, the combat outside of kicking, combat is so ineffective and stale, you are better off playing through just blocking with your weapon and kicking your enemy to their death. Once again, here is another transition that leads to yet another flaw of the game.\n\nThe combat is so boring, and the developer seemed to notice this as well, that the game is over reliant on using environments to kill the opponents. So much so you will find spiky wall thingies everywhere for some strange reason. It gets ridiculous. Luckily, many of these spiky wall thingies happen to be in some of the more interesting maps (albeit linear) in a FPS to date. The Orc fortress and cliff side houses being the high point (stupid pun intended), and offer a great many ways and places to kick enemies off of ledges.\n\nThe last way to play the game is with magic, and compared to all the other ways you can play this game, it is the most effective. But no all is well as not all spells are made equal and the only ones worth using is the basic fire bolt, lightning bolt, heal (if you don't have enough food rations or health potions), and maybe charm (though never really necessary unless you are being mobbed by many ghouls or during that duel sequence with a Orc clan leader). The trap spells (and most of the others), are kinda useful, but they're nothing but a fancy way to waste mana and character points.\n\nContinued in comments.","May 31, 2015","false","25.2"," 21 of 46 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","21","46","2","15"

This game runs on the source engine so it has that Half Life feel and sound face into it, making for a very nostalgic piece.\nAlong with that, the game is very fast paced and has a good, even difficulty with plenty of enemys in it.\n2. The Story while now adays is a bit easy to catch on to still has a good number of twists and confusing ends for you to try and figure out on the quest.\n3. The Combat is strong and the branching trees and inventory are easy to play with. Overall it takes no effort to getting used to the controls, only getting used to the task bar really.\nWith all these pros whats the one big issue with this game?\nCons -\nIt barely ever works. Reports from other players say they can barely get past the prologue, infact, the most infamous bug (the one I'm having) is that apparently, this old game from a generation ago will constantly crash on the major area of the game over and over and over. This ruins the entire experience as you'll be busy slashing at orcs while Leana is healing you, your about to land that killing blow! Then a black screen appears, the game says MM.exe is not working and all your blood lust is turned into rage. This is such a horrible flaw because its on every computer past Windows 8.1. That is total crap, the fact that an old game can't run on these high tech systems is like saying you can't use a bullet for your new fancy gun because it now needs "Special Bullets". Until I find a fix for this, steer clear of this game unless you are below Windows 8.1.","September 24, 2015","false","2.4"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Well Yes and No. Here's the reason\n\nPositive\n- A very unique gameplay of fps hack and slash\n- Decent Voice acting\n- Physic by source never disappoint.\n- Some "immersive" gameplay (discover things, literally smithing your own unique sword)\n\nCon\n- Buggggggggggggggggggggggggg.

As the nameless one you will explore castles, crypts, caves, orc villages and more on your quest to...I am not sure what the quest is but there is plenty to do/kill along the way.  However you better love the combat (melee, archery, magic) and scenery because the RPG aspects are bland and minimal.  There is character building but it is simple and never really changes how you play the game, just makes you stronger in your particular discipline or allows you to equip special weapons.  Also the skill points to “level up” are only available by completing quests, and there is a set amount so it takes forever to build your character and you are very limited in how strong you can get.  There is inventory management, but no stores to buy and sell, and what you find is also very limited.  Want to interact with NPC characters, there is none of that either except as scripted cut scenes.  As an RPG Dark Messiah is a failure, but as an action game it’s decent but very repetitive.  I made it over half way through hoping the game would get deeper or the story more interesting, but this really is just an action game at heart, and a fairly generic shallow one at that.  If that’s what you are looking for Dark Messiah is not a bad game, however if you are looking for an RPG as I was look elsewhere.\n\nI played with the Steam Gamepad, with a little tweaking it worked well and you can map everything you need to the controller if you are so inclined.\n","November 1, 2015","false","10.3"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","7","21","0","2"

For the part of the game that I was able to play, I did enjoy it a lot. It's a high fantasy first-person linear RPG, with different skill trees, combat types, and hidden secrets. By linear I mean you progress from one level to the next and can't return to older areas. It works really well - the game is surprisingly fun when it works.\n\nUInfortunately, I ran into numerous bugs that made it very difficult to proceed. One bug about 2-3 hours into the game makes it unplayable - no matter what you do at a certain stage, you are guaranteed to lose if this bug crops up. Restarting the entire level doesn't fix it. The only way to avoid the bug is to completely restart the entire game, and hope that you don't get the bug AGAIN, which would require another restart.\n\nI've searched for patches and mods to fix this and there are none. Until this game-breaking bug gets fixed, I cannot recommend this title, as much as I wish to enjoy it.","June 9, 2015","false","5.1"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","7","21","0","0"

However, as you progress, you realize just how horrible it actually is. Several fights are outright impossible if you are building a ranged fighter instead of a melee fighter, many other areas you'll go through your entire mana pool just to down one regular enemy. Arrows are slightly better, except that you can't really fire them at a fast enemy closing in on you, and you can't block with a bow.\n\nRepeatedly, the game has decided I died even though I still had over 20 HP left after being hit, the orc boss decided to smash my face in during the cutscene while he was talking without giving a chance to fight back(twice), and that's just two of the bugs I have encountered playing this game. Honestly I'd probably be rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I hadn't gotten it essentially for free.

I felt like the developers were going for a grand feel, but weren't quite able to achieve it. Everything seemed to feel a bit awkward, especially the combat. Even when out of combat, I felt strangely "off balance," as though I couldn't quite get the right feel for the world my character was in.\n\n"Dark Messiah" also had significant technical problems on my machine. For reasons I never understood, the framerate would start out well and then gradually drop to the single digits. Reloading an area would fix the problem...only for it to come back. I attempted a couple of different fixes, but I couldn't nail down the problem.\n\nIn the end, I had a game that just generally wasn't fun to play and would become flat out unplayable after a few minutes.\n\nI just can't recommend something like that.","December 25, 2014","false","2.9"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","0"

After playing for more than half of the game, I honestly regret buying it, even in 75% discount price. This game might have been great in 2006, but it's annoying in 2015 and not really fun. I could overlook the technical aspects due to game's age (except for the forced motion sickness mode), but even the gameplay mechanics are poor compared to newer games (or even, say, Half Life 1).\n\nThe gameplay issues\nEnemy variety is tragic. There are like 4 different enemy types, everyone looks the same, and an area is usually populated by a single type or two. You fight them over and over again.\nThe fact that you can use environment to kill is cool, but in this game you are forced to do so, and you're almost forbidden to use standard means (like, a sword!). Because the enemies are extremely hard when fighting the standard style (they can parry as fast as you can strike and they never miss a parry), but they are extremely vulnerable when anything hits them. Throwing a jar at them can yield a better result than hitting them with a sword from behind to a neck (really, because a jar or a barrel knocks them down and you can then kill them instantly, but hitting them from behind to a head doesn't... makes real sense, and definitely not a gimmick!). So using environment is not a great addition to your fighting style here, it's shoved down your throat and you need to use it all the time.\n\nThe technical issues\nThe game is full of bugs that either make you fail instantly or prevent completion of the area. I had to load a past save several times to work around those. Make sure you save (and don't rely just on a quicksave).\nYou'll get stuck on anything and everything. Using ladders, ropes, jumping through a window, all of that is incredible pain and you'll often die because the engine is dumb.\nThe lighting is so bad that half of the game is well lit and the other half is pitch black (like house interior during a day). Enabling HDR makes it even worse. You can't see a damn thing and you need to use night vision a lot just to work around poor lighting. Adjusting gamma doesn't help too much, you'll still see sh** and the rest will be blinding bright.\nThe hitboxes and targeting, oh damn. Very often you hit something completely else, like a wall *behind* a person. Performing an execution is a random chance whether the game considers you in the right place or not.\nThe UI for switching weapons is far from usable. You can switch from sword+shield to a bow, but you can't switch back. You can either switch bow->sword (and only then add a shield), or switch bow->shield+random weapon (usually not the one you want). Very clever.\nForced motion sickness. Oh yes, you human weaklings, the developers will let you suffer, you deserve it. You can disable head bobbing, but that's the least of the problem. The image tilts every time you strafe. Every time you move sideways, your view moves unnaturally, right side up left side down, or vice versa, like boat swaying on a see. I found a way to disable it, otherwise I'd have refunded this immediately. You can see my solution on pcgamingwiki[pcgamingwiki.com].\n\nI ended in chapter 6 in crypts, fighting zombies. I didn't see sh**, everything was pitch black so I had to constantly toggle night vision, and it was near impossible to execute a zombie, because of targeting glitches, so the fights took eternity. There was no fun in that.\n\nHow long can you enjoy throwing barrels at people and kicking them from ramps, when you're forced to do that a thousand times over and there's no other way? 9 hours seems to be my experience. (In hindsight, I was really persistent.)","September 24, 2015","false","9.0"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

EA Sports actually has the rights to the sequel, and has lent the same code for fifa road to world cup (tm) so that they would use the same mechanics, only instead of a leather ball it's orcs, spiders, humans that you kick around.\nAnd they fly! Look at them fly! Like tiny dragon butterflies they fly and fall of walls, on spikes very accurately placed so that you can kick your foes into (it's a soccer goal, I know).\nThe magic system is awesome: You have to wait for many seconds in between spells, that are not really better than melée combat at any time in the game. Also, the enemies can run forever, and you can, which is very good, because that means you actually get to die, when 45 enemies spam over you and can run forever while you are like a fat, retired Ronaldo that is about to be hacked to death by angry orc mobs.\nAlso, ingenious, is the fact that the animations are not skippable in game. I love that. You can't stop the orc cleric from having the most boring speech ever.\nThe stealth system is mandatory, and even if it doesn't work, exactly as in real life, it might bring you some advantage before you kick the enemies and you see them flying in the air.\nFighting is amazing; your hits don't land, you have no clue how much damage you're dealing, and that makes the game far much more real. Also, using first person shooters with movement combos for power strikes is ingenious, i.e. you will break many mouses. Mouses are fun to break. And Overrated.\nThe game is also very smart: In order to increase the user experience, it will have mandatory game stops that happen at random. Yes, the game will crash on many animations, which makes for excelent user experience and will leave you hungry for more.\nDon't buy this game.","July 15, 2015","false","11.0"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Klingenmeister/recommended/2100/","Klingenmeister","Klingenmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Klingenmeister/","104 products in account",""Kicking Simulator"\n\nI really dont know, what I should think about that game and I really dont know, what I should write about it.\nBased on the Source Engine and Half Life 2, the Game places you into a medival fantasy setting, somehow based on the universe of Heroes of Might and Magic.\nThe story (if we can call this "something" a story) is a classic "slumbering evil is about to get awaken. Player is a unknown noname who will face incredible odds and become a true hero with hidden destiny. I think this is, how IGN would describe this game.\n\nBut well, lets talk about the story (maybe spoilers!):\n\nYou are some student of a wizard, discover an artifact, get a mission to hinder the dark forces from unleashing a great evil. Then, after a short intro session (which is quite a nice tutorial), you will get a mysterious female companion, who is bound to you and is only speaking in your head.\nThis is, where the game gets strange, somehow interesting, and crazy and throws tons of klischees at you.\nShortly after you are in the middle of a necro army, a cult that will fight evil with evil, your hidden destiny (which is totally silly) and a (total stupid) choice between two sides.\nThe game even have some decisions, you can make and has "4" endings. (kinda)\n\nBut dont expect a deep story. If the game were a parody of fantasy plots it would be a 20/10. Maybe it is a parody and I got it wrong. But the whole storyline throws so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at you, that you go through 3 phases.\nFirst you are enjoying it.\nThen it annoys you.\nAt last you encountered so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, that it starts to be a real fun (like: At this point I will just lean back and smile).\nThe whole story has one good part, which is also its greatest flaw:\nThe two female characters. One a voice talking in your head, the other a young mage, not talking in your head, but is annoying, useless and always in your way. Because of the major plot around these two characters, the whole story seems to be a big funny stupid fanservice. Both characters seems to fight each other to get you, even if they will never meet in the whole game. Both are making you compliments, trying to get your attention and in the end, trying to get you to kill the other one.\nWhile the the mage is an annoying little girl, the voice in your head is a well written, awesome voiced character, who is maybe the strongest and most enjoyable element of the game. While I hated every single second hearing the mage girl talking, I enjoyed every second of the other character, laughed about her dark jokes and couldnt do anything but liking her, even if she is "the evil one".\nWithin the game, you have the choice to rescue the mage, after she is captured and nearly fed to giant spiders, after that, she tries to get you cleaned from the voice in your head.\nI rescued the mage and then tried both decisions...man, I never felt so guilty after killing the voice. It was (given the age of the game) one of the most touching scenes outside of a cutscene in a game.\nEven after loading my game, I still felt guilty.\nWell, in the end, siding with the woman in your head, you WILL have to face and kill the mage. It is not even a bossfight. It is a stupid girl, who is mad at you, and wont stand down, until you kill her.\n\nMaybe the game want to teach you a lesson of life decisions and their consequences, I dont know.\n\nThe combat system is somewhat awesome and frustrating. You can block, do different strike attacks, sneak, use bow and magic. But the main part is your enviroment. Every object, you can move, you can use as a weapon. Pick it up, use telekenesis, kick it...you can do so many things, to make your environment your weapon. If you ever felt like it is a good idea to end a mountain fight by kicking your enemy of the cliff, this is your game.\nBut after enjoying your big playground for a few minutes, it will get really annoying after the first hour. Throwing objects will get boring, and a fight at the docks, ending a fight by kicking nearly every enemy into the water, because it is an insta kill, will make you question your life decisions.\nSwordfight is unsatisfing because the enemy blocks every non power attack and on his side hits you every time, you lower your own block.\nMagic feels even more static than in skyrim and looks over 5 years older than the game already is. Also it simply does no damage.\nRanged comat is flawless, which makes it a flaw. You could play the game with bow only, kicking your enemys out of melee range, camping on top of stairs and feel simply op.\nSneaking and dagger fighting feels somehow useless, because you have to put way to many skillpoints into it, but still after the first kill the survivors will start attacking you, even when they couldnt see you. Walking in sneak mode is one of the slowest movements I ever encountered in any game.\n\nBut my favourite were the bossfights. First looking really good, they mostly will turn into a confusing pseudo cutscene, where you senseless attacking the monster, until one of your followers tells you, what you really have to do.\nAlso I really dont get, how you are able to finish the final fight without any ranged attacks.\n\n\nI really had to push myself to finish this game and Im not really happy about it. It is a game full of great ideas, which could have given the start to an age of medival FPS games, but was so poorly executed, that everyone forgot the game.\n\nIn the end, the only thing I remember clearly, is the funny voice of Xana (the voice in your head) and I think it is the best memory I can get from this game.\n\n\nLast but not least I want to say: Making the mage girl your follower, making her killable and making her a story relevant character, so you will loose the game, if she dies, and then making her stupid as ♥♥♥♥, running into her death...I was terrified how much I enjoyed the moment, shutting her up for good. What a crazy game, making you go down the evil part, because the only good character makes your skin crawl.\n\n(I had a lot of more things I could rant about, but it is irrelevant)","December 10, 2014","false","8.3"," 9 of 37 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","9","37","0","0"

It introduces alot of very interesting and unique concepts along the way, and item progression, as well as skill progression, actually matter quite a bit in this game. The main pitfalls (heh...) of this title are the mechanics, the physics engine. Enemies are tough to kill in combat, even if you tool yourself out with the best equipment possible, the game is brutally difficult. As such, many just resort to ranged combat, and trick the AI into getting stuck, so they can peg them with dozens of arrows.\n\nMain issues I encountered were such:\n\nGetting lost again and again, which I realised was partly due to several progression bugs which prevent key doors from opening. The level layout does tend to make everything sort of blend in, so figuring out just which corridor contains the identical looking wooden door you need to go through does happen.\n\nThe rope bow/arrow, well before the latest Croft game and other titles empoyed it, is quite fun, until you start floating through walls while climbing ropes, because the physics engine was not programmed to deal with this vital game mechanic. The number of times I died whilst trying to do the fiddliest of tricky platforming (which as always, in a first person game, is just an awful idea from the start), due to the rope intersecting with a chunk of rock, which caused me to noclip out of the level... It gets frustrating very quickly.\n\nFinally, the magic in this game feels utterly flat. Fireballs hit enemies as though you just threw a small water balloon at them. Lightning appears to have the same effect as assaulting your enemy with a particularly wet piece of paper. There was absolutely no appeal to using magic in this game except as a means to use the mana I have anyway.\n\nIf you really want to try it, nothing I say is going to stop you, but otherwise i'd say leave this game where it belongs, in the past.","June 30, 2014","false","27.5"," 4 of 42 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","4","42","0","0"

From the clunky controls to the frustratingly simple combat, the core game mechanics are boring, and the presentation is quite shabby to boot.\n\nGraphics- While some of the game's graphics can look pretty good, the overall effects are very uneven. Especially the game's more open areas look absolutely atrocious in comparison to other source games, as low res textures and bad backdrops abound.\n\nSound- I found the sound design to be generic and not really anything special, although it did the job. The voice acting was pretty bad.\n\nGameplay- The hack and slash mechanics with magic mixed in work much better in other titles that mix these dynamics, but for some reason Dark Messiah features a terribly frustrating control scheme and nonsensical combat mechanics that often feature your character taking damage full seconds after the enemy blows have been deflected. Button mashing combined with circle strafing led me to the most success when playing this game. In short, the gameplay, enemy, weapon and skill systems are pretty generic and do not provide for a satisfying experience.\n\n\nIn addition to these concerns, the story is very very dull, providing no narrative flow or any kind of imperative to your actions.\n\nOverall, I'd say Dark Messiah is a sad example of low-budget game development gone wrong.","December 31, 2013","false","1.7"," 6 of 52 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","6","52","0","0"

It seems to be very, very interesting.\n\nBUT.\n\nCould this game be any more harder? It's so hard it's almost ridiculous. I never was able to even finish the first level, even on Easy difficulty. Already the first enemies you encounter are like boss battles. I mean, even with bow and arrow an enemy takes about 5 to 10 shots before dying. A sneaky shot from behind to the head from behind doesn't deal any more damage.\n\nThis is ridiculous.\n\nAdditional to that comes the somewhat extremely clunky, not responsive controls. It's just plain awful and frustrating to play.\n\nThe levels are designed to provide unique ways to kill an enemy, like kicking them into spikes / over the railing or destroying some planks which hold some barrels. This seems to be the ONLY way to succeed in this game, since a direct confrontation is pure suicide. Further problem is: Moving your character seems to be too stiff and not responsive and the back-steps are so tiny you're constantly being attacked.\n\nIn conclusion for me, this game is way too hard, clunky and therefore no fun at all. I really tried it on Easy difficulty several times with different approaches and even on this setting its unplayable. For hardcore gamers or those who get the right tactic this might be a challenge but for gamers who just want some casual fun now and then, not a good choice.\n\nUpdate: Curiosity made me cheat - so I activated the God Mode, gave myself about 300 skill points and put everything to the maximum. I have to say: Good thing I didn't play this game the normal way so the disappointment came rather short. The visual effects and presentation of the spells like fireball or lightning bolt (both are fired through your hands) are looking, feeling and sounding very, VERY uninspired and boring.\n\nDon't buy it.

A jogabilidade é muito simples e divertida (eu realmente fico animado jogando), os gráficos não são ruins, já que o jogo foi lançado em 2006 e usa a Source, engine da VALVE utilizada em Half-Life 2.\nQuando joguei esse jogo veio logo uma coisa em minha mente: Dark Messiah = Oblivion + Ação (jogabilidade mais dinâmica), e é bem isso que vocês vão encontrar neste jogo.\n\nNota: 9.0 / 10.0\n\nNota 9.0 por que acho que deveria ter mais customização e mais equipamentos no jogo.

A number of ways to play through the game whether you want to go magic, melee or archer. Special shoutout to the greatest kick in the history of gaming. Kicking enemies off of ledges or into the ocean is a blast. The story is slight but there are four different endings depending on a few decisions.

It's built on Source, and looks pretty good for the time. The mechanics are introduced in a fashion that doesn't leave you with many questions and the gameplay is pretty solid. There's a basic RPG framework built into the game that allows you to choose specialisation in three different primary areas of mastery. Stealth, Magic, and Weaponmastery. The enemy variety is mixed up enough to keep you from getting too bored, but the formula is pretty much the same for most humanoid enemies. The game includes a kick that has the ability to knock back a lot of enemies, and the game liberally places hazards for you to take advantage of, so most often it's a lot easier for you to just kick someone off of a ledge or into spikes than actually fight them.\nI feel the game is geniunely very difficult without taking the heal spell from the mage tree, but other than that, you can play the game without there being too many necessary skills. I would say that it's mandatory to either get magic or bows, however.","July 6, 2014","true","109.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played through it multiple times, and will probably continue doing so.\n\nCompletely different than all the other M&M games and much more intimate, IMO.\nThe combat is perfect.  You're given the option of using multiple types of weapons from swords, daggers, staffs and more. Each with their own special traits.  Nothing feels the same.  Wielding magic in this game is awesome.\nStealth is also close to being on par with the original Thief games.\n\nThis game, even being almost 9 years old, is still better than 90% of the other First Person RPG's.  It still stands the test of time with great storytellind and rewarding gameplay. I think it even has better combat and story than Skyrim.  But it isn't open world like Skyrim is.  I keep hoping/wishing M&M would sequal this game, or keep progressing with this genre in some other way.  I think it does much better then their current stock of games.\n\nTo the point - Get this game. its a 10/10\n","December 2, 2014","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Too bad, the game still have some minor bugs and memory leak problem in some OS. Plus, multiplayer is abandoned. I hope they make sequel or put WASD+attack style in Dishonored (Yeah, same studio).

Before their rise to recognition. Arkane Studios made a semi-obscure game called Dark Messiah of Might & Magic.\n\nDark Messiah of Might & Magic, is the story about a young man named Sareth who has been trained his whole life by his mentor named Wizard Phenrig. In time he is finally given a task on helping his mentor Phenrig to find a sacred crystal called the Shantiri Crystal. After retrieving the Crystal, he's sent off by Phenrig to travel to the city of Stonehelm in which he's to deliver the crystal to another Wizard named Menelag, who is lord of Stonehelm. Though Sareth doesn't go alone and is given a spirit guide by Phenrig called Xana, who resides in Sareth mind.\n\nDMOMAM (Dark Messiah of Might & Magic) story is possibly one of the worst stories a fantasy game could ever have. From the characters names, dialogue and boring and forgetful lore. DMOMAM doesn't seem to have any redeeming qualities in this field. Characters are usually shuffled in and out as quick as possible with very little backstory or personality to them. Many of the characters are more annoying than interesting. The spiritual guide; Xana is by far the most annoying out of the bunch as she literally talks in a sinister and almost hammy voice which is off putting beyond belief. The voice acting in the game is also terrible with chew-scenery attitudes and almost wooden performance from each character. Even if they were good it wouldn't have saved the goofy dialogue.\n\nThough this may be the case for DMOMAM, what the game really shines on is its gameplay. DMOMAM's gameplay features a wide range of skills and traits for Sareth to choose from. This game is more fantasy RPG in skills than any other aspect. The game provides Stealth, Combat and magic as the main skills in which you can choose from. When specializing in one skill it can be very satisfying taking out enemies, like using a fireball to sizzle opponents alive, hack off a enemies head with sword, use the bow to take out targets from a distance and use Stealth to backstab your enemies silently. All is great fun and having the use of the kick mechanic can send enemies flying to their death onto spiked walls or off ledges. This is helped by the fact that the game engine that they use is the Source Engine. Which does good use with the physics and certain traps that are featured in the game.\n\nDMOMAM does have some slip-ups with the combat though, sometimes the games hit detection glitches up, making you miss your opponents body, leaving you open to be hit. Because the game uses an actual character in first-person than a set of floating hands, it can be hard to navigate when climbing up stones and buildings in high places, leading you to a quick death. The stealth though good in some areas, is flawed in that it’s too easy to sneak and hide. The game uses an indicator which goes from 0-4 bars (0 being exposed, 4 being hidden), sometimes you'll be completely hidden even though you are out in board daylight which doesn't make any sense.\n\nThe graphics in the game are quite good and have aged well since the games release, with good physics and great lighting and textures, the game does holds up very well and helps with the immersion of the game. Art design of the world is quite boring when located in cities such as Stonehelm but at great when going through the mountains and dark caves. The sound design is quite weak when coming to certain sound especially from magic spells.\n\nDMOMAM though is a game with tons of potential but a lot of things bring it down. It is a fun game though and will keep you entertained due to its RPG skills tree which will give you a decent amount of replay value.\n\n(Strong) 6.50/ 10.0\n","March 2, 2014","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the first to use the Source engine, you step into the role of a wizard's apprentice and go treking through your round-of-the-mill fantasy setting. Conspiracies and such follow, but suffice to say that the game's emphasis on physics and a realistic first-person perspective (you ride into town in a wagon, which makes for a really nice intro) more than make up for its short-comings. I learned that the third or forth time I impaled a grunt on a spike by kicking him off of the roof, only after first ramming his head into the roof itself several times.

Some might say 'ahead of it's time' others might say 'just plain wierd.' It isn't like a traditional RPG in a lot of ways, with no clear stats to manage. But there is gear and skills to choose from, and different ways to approach the games problems. All of those are quite solid, although the game doesn't do a very good job of telegraphing any of it, or explaining it. The underlying cake, while a bit old, is still reasonably tasty.\n- Atmosphere: While visually dated, the tone of the game is fairly robust, with consistent motifs playing through with nods to old Might and Magic storylines. What this boils down to is the cream of the cake, which while basic, is still ok.\n\nCons:\n- Graphics: Visually the game has not aged well. Compared to Half-Life 2 which also used the Source Engine, DM looks craptacular.\n\n- Difficulty curve: The game throws you to the wolves quite quickly. Given the ways that the combat, stealth and magic are unusual, this learning curve can be quite sharp as not only is the player having to learn new systems for a game, they have to learn new systems FOR THE GENRE. Comparisons abound between DM and Skyrim, and while they are significantly different, what has made Skyrim remarkably successful is it's approachability - something that DM clearly lacks. On the flipside, the combat and mechanics as mentioned above do allow for a deeper experience than Skyrim, but it does require more work from the players part in order to get the full enjoyment from that experience.\n\nSummary\n\nIf you're looking for a something quite different, and don't mind picking up something that is a little dated, give Dark Messiah a go.","September 28, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has the basic RPG theme of weapons and magic and arrows and etc. but what i find so unique about it, is it's combat system. It's very, dynamic. Very, very dynamic. Fighting is very enjoyable with a selection of different types of weapons with the same style base, with little intresting tweaks to how your charecter attacks. Also you have a Duke Mighty Foot attack, which is really enjoyable.\n\nI actually enjoyed this a bit more than skyrim, because in games like skyrim, its click constantly and seeing the same attack movment, here it's about swinging in certain directions and blocking at certain times and feels like your actually having a DYNAMIC sword fight.\n\nDynamic is really the word i normally use to describe this, because everything about it is so dynamic and free flowing.\n\nAt least give the demo ago and try it out, its really enjoyable.\n\n*also dont trust the console versions.

It is very good and comparable to oblivion. It is more graphic though with some small nudity and some gore.\nThe graphics are quite great and what makes this game diferent then other similar games is the fact that pretty much anything can be a weapon. You can kick people off cliffs you can throw barrels at your enemies you light people on fire and impale them on spikes.\nThis game says might and magic but has little to no relation to the Heroes or might and magic series.\nThis game is a bit like half-life meaning that you are the pretty much silent antagonist that goes through a linear game following peoples orders to the end. The best thing though is you are destined to be good or evil and you can choose how the game ends and no matter what you do, you will always get the same skill points to spend on skills that you have. And you get to pick if you want to be more like a warrior that has higher stamina and can crush his foes with great swords and things that have high damage.\nOr more like a mage that has devestating spells to crush any enemy\nor my favorite the assasin type, letting you sneak behind characters unseen and backstabbing them and avoiding combat all together.\n\nThis really is a great game with a great story and plenty of secrets and weapons.

If you did, check out Dark Messiah. The gameplay is absolutely flawless - using the environment, to destroy your enemies. If that's not enough, create your own hero: you can became a warrior, who is mastered with one handed weapons, and a shield. If you are not the fan of weapons, you can became a wizard: lethal fireballs, freezing spells, or just pick up a barrel with telekinesis, and smash their heads. Too much offensive battles? Then become a rogue! Dual-wielding daggers, and hiding in the darkness. Just stab'em in the back, or just kick them in the end of a cliff. Multiple endings (depending on which side you choose on your adventure), genial soundtrack, and the list goes on and on - absolutely marvelous game, but sadly it's way UNDERRATED! The only problem that the multiplayer isn't the best.

Apparently went it first released, it was hampered with bugs and over shadowed by games like Oblivion. It is a Source Engine based game that plays very much like a combination of Thief and Half Life controls/combat.  It uses chapters/missions similar to both of those games as well.  It isn't open world but that won't bother you because there is plenty of loot hidden in secret areas for you to find.  It also starts off a bit rough with a hard to understand story and uninteresting at the time, plus the combat is difficult until you get new skills/weapons.\n\nThe combat in this game is so well done, especially for a game this old.  Most people say that if Elder Scrolls had this combat, they would be the best games ever made.  You'll have so much fun kicking enemies into spikes, fire, off stairs and using the many types of weapons you find along the way.  You even get to forge a few weapons.  Once you get past the first few chapters the story and gameplay really get great. I highly suggest playing on Hard mode because it forces you to use the various methods of fighting within the environment well.  You can activate traps laced within rooms like cutting ropes on swining objects, throwing oil on the ground and lighting enemies on fire, etc.  This game was worth every penny and I can't wait to finish it.\n\nPros\n- Brilliant Combat System (super fun)\n- Variety of weapons to use and loot\n- Challenging Difficulties\n- Interesting Environments\n- Great Inventory and Skill System\n- Interactive Environments and Secrets\n\nCons\n- Mission based\n- Not Open World (plenty to explore though)\n- Story is bland at times\n- Steep learning curve\n- Unbalanced beginning\n- Slightly outdated and a few bugs remain (not the spiders)\n\nScore 9/10","February 22, 2014","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The level design can be confusing, yes, but it’s creative and entertaining. The combat does get a lot quicker and more intense as the game goes on, and the huge “bosses” you have to fight through the game are all epic and nerve-wrecking.\n\nOverall, this game is a recommend for me, but only to people who are willing to overlook some pretty major flaws in order to find a very entertaining and unique adventure. Fully action-based FPSRPGs are hard to find, and Dark Messiah finds that niche nicely. If nothing else, give the demo a shot. It gives you a pretty good idea of what you’re in for.\n","March 12, 2014","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It even has good multiplayer, which combines classed-based point capturing like TF2 with a per-round experience system that gives you greater abilities like in the single-player (although I don't know how many people are on the multiplayer anymore).

One thing is clear, though. Dark Messiah is a PC game, meant for gamers rather than mainstream turkies (gobble gobble!).\n\nComparisons aside, this game has its moments but the AI is rather simplistic. Combine this with highly linear mapping and progression, and you have something very close to a late 90's-early 2000's, relic. Still, the distinction between the "classes" is well done. Magic, however, is feeble through most of the game without certain gameplay "tweaks". Typical really, as most devs have little vision for such things. Once you get a certain upgrade, however, you become untouchable. That's abstinent, rudimentry balancing if I ever saw it. The main problem lies with the adrenaline system and why magic had to be tied to it.\n\nLike most medieval-based games of this nature, Dark Messiah is catered primarily towards fans of swords, shields, and gimmicky action. I will say they did a good job of it, though. Progression and mapping may be simple, but the environment itself can be a lethal weapon. Magic may be feeble, but it's done just well enough to be enjoyable.","August 9, 2013","true","26.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I rememeber playing this game years ago and not being able to finish it. It's a real hidden gem this game for people who've only recently purchased a pc (such as myself). Maybe not worth the ten pound now, but God DAMN I wanted to finish this game!\n\nThe gameplay is the real draw here and it is definitely a shame that no sequels have been made. Where Might and Magic has an incredible depth to it's history and lore, this game deals in here and now. How am I going to nutralise this guard? If I shot that cyclops in the eye would it have gone down? How badass is the magic???\n\nAll valid questions. More dedicated players will have more to come back for in the sense of difficulty. However, I'm not that guy! I found it a good challenge to play with mouse and keyboard on just normal, but then again I am a recent adopter!\n\nMost definitely my favourite purchase on steam so far. All the hours are worth experiencing even if the story is a little droll compared to the action.","September 14, 2014","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wether it be outplaying them in the way of melee combat or simply being a lil bich and chucking a barrel right in their face, this game offers many, MANY ways to play it with its huge replay value.\n\n\nWanna be a spell-casting mage that still fights with swords with the occasional use of bows?\nGo right the hell ahead, there is absolutely no limitations that stop you from doing just that.\nThe incredible versatility and depth of the combat system provides many etertaining ways to dispatch enemies.\n\nLearn ice magic and freeze your enemies. Discover that you can use said spell on the ground and create a patch of ice, watch and laugh your ♥♥♥ off as 5 orcs coming to chase you all slip on said ice and fall to their deaths. This is just one of the many past times you'll come to see in this game\n\nThe game is built on the source engine and makes use of all the nice, juicy physics engine that we've all come to love over time. Pick up heavy objects and toss it at enemies which results in the enemy stumbling hilariously in whatever direction the object was thrown in. Use your mighty Duke Nukem boot to send a baddy flying down a crevice or to send them into the many VERY  convinently traps.\n\nThe RPG elements certainly blend well with the game, with the skill trees being flexible and many of the skills being quite handy. You are also able to spread your skills however you please so it opens up many possibilities on different playstyles that will certainly not all be experienced in just one single playthrough.","August 22, 2011","true","92.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Solinarius/recommended/2100/","Solinarius","Solinarius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Solinarius/","176 products in account","Right off the bat, Dark Messiah makes me question the simplistic nature of all combat in the Elder's Scrolls games. One thing is clear, though. Dark Messiah is a PC game, meant for gamers rather than mainstream turkies (gobble gobble!).\n\nComparisons aside, this game has its moments but the AI is rather simplistic. Combine this with highly linear mapping and progression, and you have something very close to a late 90's-early 2000's, relic. Still, the distinction between the "classes" is well done. Magic, however, is feeble through most of the game without certain gameplay "tweaks". Typical really, as most devs have little vision for such things. Once you get a certain upgrade, however, you become untouchable. That's abstinent, rudimentry balancing if I ever saw it. The main problem lies with the adrenaline system and why magic had to be tied to it.\n\nLike most medieval-based games of this nature, Dark Messiah is catered primarily towards fans of swords, shields, and gimmicky action. I will say they did a good job of it, though. Progression and mapping may be simple, but the environment itself can be a lethal weapon. Magic may be feeble, but it's done just well enough to be enjoyable.","August 9, 2013","true","26.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Alt-tabbing is almost guaranteed to crash it. Sometimes it just crashes because it feels like it.\n\nOther than that, this game is great. The world is fairly generic high fantasy, but it does have a dark atmosphere to it that sets it apart. The game is called "Might and Magic" - but by far the most fun and viable way to play the game is Might. The first person melee combat is actually enjoyable and fairly deep.\n\nThe most fun part of the game, though, is kicking things. The playable character has a mighty boot that is extremely satisfying to hit enemies with, and the game is littered with deadly things for you to kick them into. Kick them off ledges, into spikes, into fires, etc.","February 28, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
