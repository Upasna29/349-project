I was too poor back in the day to have anything more than the shareware version of ROTT so this'll give me a chance to delve deeper into that title that I really loved. It's amazing how well it holds up today, once you change the control scheme to something more modern. (which is doable, though I had to substitute middle and right mouse buttons for look up and look down, which thankfully is seldom needed) ROTT has just about everything I like in a classic FPS: The fast movement speed, the exploration, the waves of mooks you get to mow down in droves with your superhuman prowess. But what I also enjoyed is the complete lack of realism, and the platforming which, unlike in the 2013 remake, you could more or less opt out of the more difficult platforming sections which only provided rewards like 3-ups. (I'm a bit unusual in that I like the platforming) I look forward to completing the game and subsequently getting destroyed by Extreme ROTT.\n\nOne thing ROTT really has going for it is personality. There are so many little easter eggs to find, like the end-stage music when you finish a level in Dog Mode, the murderous game quit sequences, the ludicrous gibs, and so much more. You can tell the developers weren't making shovelware here, they made something that they can proudly affix their names onto.\n\nBlake Stone is a bit iffy at the moment. It was never on my radar in the 90's. Even though I grew up with the awkward Wolfenstein controls which were designed to be keyboard only, it will take time to reacquaint myself with those. Unlike ROTT, it's not possible to rig a typical modern keyboard and mouse FPS control scheme.\nIt's not the game's fault at all -- it was the standard for everything, including DOOM, at the time. I do want to give it a shot, as it seems to have more complex objectives than the run-and-gun style of FPS that Wolfenstein was. It'll just take me time to prepare...I haven't used that control scheme since Quake in the late 90's, which I subsequently abandoned after getting annihilated by keyboard-mouse players. FPS controls aren't like a certain plumber whose controls have remained steady, with new moves merely added onto existing controls since the 80's. This difference is mainly due to the lack of mouse driver standardization back in the early 90's -- not to mention many people didn't even have a mouse back then. Trackballs were also strongly competing with the modern mouse in the early 90's, which justified the fact that pushing your mouse up moves your character forward. It wasn't until the late 90's and early 00's that FPS controls settled into what they are today.","October 1, 2014","true","18.5"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","31","34","0","1"

Some of the monsters share a screeching sound effect with aliens in X-Com and so those games are forever linked in my mind.  Rise of the Triad is interesting, too, being a 1994 (or 1995 for the full version) game planned as a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D, even using a heavily modified version of that game's engine well after the release of Doom...!","July 1, 2014","true","0.6"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","25","25","0","0"

Awesome pack that comes with everything you need for a nice DOS 3D shooter revival.

The original Adlib sound is included as well. Highly recommended if you want to legaly own and play these classics.\n\nThe only downside: There is no Linux version for it, which means the pack won't appear as   installable under a Linux Steam Client, after you bought it.","December 9, 2013","true","1.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

It's twice as intense as Doom and twice as difficult. The over-the-top weapons, high-speed platforming, and irreverent humor make for one hell of a classic FPS. The visuals are a little less impressive than Doom, which was released a year prior. This never came as a distraction to me and actually made the game feel a little more abstract, which lends to the memorability of the level design despite the repetitive textures. You'll get lost and frustrated, but the difficulty is balanced with playability, and that's what keeps a connoisseur of first-person shooters from giving up.","December 15, 2013","true","37.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/haruharuharuka/recommended/238050/","haruharuharuka","Haruka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/haruharuharuka/","3517 products in account","In the year 1995, the First Person Shooter genre was going strong. Wolfenstein 3D... Doom... Heretic... They all put id Software on the map, and defined the genre. And then Apogee Software blew the FPS concept to tiny bloody chunks, and rebuilt it into something totally ludicrous. Enter Rise of The Triad. Starting out as a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D, Rise of The Triad was revamped into a whole new experience. Featuring five unique playable characters, a massive arsenal of deadly firepower, an actual narrative, dog mode, god mode, shrooms mode, one incredibly deadly baseball bat, enemies who begged you to spare their lives (before flopping over to play dead so they could stab you in the back as soon as you turn around), and enough ludicrous gibs to earn it the billing of "most violent game ever", RoTT was an amazing experience when played alone. Add to that the amazing "COMM-BAT" multiplayer experience, it's pretty clear that Rise of The Triad hit a home run.\n\nBut let's head back to a time two years before Rise of The Triad came to be. In 1993, JAM Productions created a new game franchise centered around a hero named Blake Stone, and had Apogee Software publish it. A sci-fi thriller to the core, Aliens of Gold saw the titular secret agent Blake Stone facing off against his nemesis, an insidiously corrupt and morally bankrupt geneticist named Dr. Pyrus Goldfire. Technologically it built on the Wolfenstein 3D engine, adding in new features such as friendly NPC characters, working vending machines, and most impressively for the time, floor and ceiling textures. Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold actually managed to beat id Software's Doom to the market by one week and achieved modest popularity because of it, but was unfortunately overshadowed by the explosive popularity of id's smash hit.\n\nThe release of Doom and subsequent decline in sales of the first Blake Stone did not faze JAM Productions however, and in the following year of 1994 they released a new entry, Blake Stone: Planet Strike. Picking up immediately after Aliens of Gold, Planet Strike continues Blake's pursuit of Dr. Goldfire and this mutant army. Not only did it introduce more levels, more weapons, and more monsters, Planet Fire also included a fully functional automap feature, a handy too for those who tended to get lost in the mazelike levels. It's a more than worthy conclusion to an awesome as hell duology, and it definitely earns its place in this fine compilation.\n\nWhen you take these three classic games and compare them to the stale FPS games of this generation, it becomes quite clear that a helluva lot more consideration was put into the level design and gameplay back in the days of yore. These three oldschool masterpieces gain massive amounts of replayability from the fact that back then the devs took time to design secrets and challenges to keep players coming back for more, unlike today's cookie cutter cinematic borefests. Another thing that is clear is how much time and effort Interceptor put into polishing these gems so that they shine on modern PCs. They are all lovingly wrapped in a DosBox-based frontend, and run natively in widescreen from the get go, no need for fiddling around with configuration to get these oldschool beauties running. They've even thrown in the original Rise of The Triad soundtrack, and the Extreme RoTT expansion at no extra cost. So what are you waiting for? Go get this primo can of whoopass!","December 3, 2013","true","0.7"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

The Throwback Pack includes the original Rise of the Triad, and it's expansion Extreme Rise of the Triad. Both in their original glory, played through Dos Box.\n\nBut what sold me on this was the inclusion of Blake Stone Aliens of Gold and it's lesser known successor, Planet Strike. Back in the days when Wolfenstein 3D ruled the FPS roster, Blake Stone was a refreshing diversion from the dark halls filled with Nazis and trips into hell. Leaning more toward an 80's sci fi horror FPS, Blake gave everything that Doom and Wolfenstien had, plus the introduction of food dispensers, and the ability to return to levels you had already visited to access areas you missed, or to top off your supplies.\n\nAll in all, there is no reason that these should not be in your Steam library. My only detraction, is that I wish they had released more of Apogee's titles from this period.","June 25, 2014","true","11.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Despite being inferior on a technical level, I found myself having more fun with Blake Stone than Rise of the Triad.

Case in point: the old Rise of the Triad and Blake Stone games. This was back when the name Apogee actually meant something.  I say it’s disappointing looking at myself because I’ve forgotten how to not WASD. See, back in the old days, you moved forward and backward and turned with the arrow keys, then had to hold down alt if you wanted to sidestep. It seems rather counter-intuitive if you’re used to the WASD system and it’s really hard to go back.\n\nWorse still, the games don’t make it much easier because the key bindings are hard to manipulate and often don’t want to work with the mouse. That said, IF you can manage to retrain your hands, this is a great set of nostalgia that shouldn’t be passed up. Maybe I can get the joystick to cooperate…hmmmm.

Blake stone is a wolfenstein ripoff that can't bind "w" and "s" but can bind "a" and "d". The controls are terrible. Also the level design is terrible. I spent 20 min running around the same level I'd killed everyone and checked everything. I even watched a walkthough and none of walls the guy moved were moveable and none of the areas were opened. There's no direction. And the guns and everything suck. Rise of the triad games are pretty crappy too, as I'd played re-master and its boring guns, with bad controls, repetitive enemies, boring levels. This has the nostalgia factor, but there's a reason none of these games are still around.","November 25, 2015","false","0.8"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","18","3","17","4","2"

The Blake Stone games are simply too archaic and not customizable enough to really be all that playable by today's standards unless you have a real tolerance for Wolfenstein 3D-era first-person shooting.\n\nRise of the Triad itself is still surprisingly solid and fun, but like a lot of older first-person shooters, the bulk of the late-game maps tend to drag on far too long and the "puzzles" in them can become a bit too arbitrary and frustrating, involving too many key hunts and weirdo "press the hidden button on this wall" tricks that got old even in Doom.\n\nI wouldn't call this pack or even Rise of the Triad essential. It's a fun curiosity, but the other games you know from this specific era of PC gaming are just better. Even Rise of the Triad's over-the-top nature isn't enogh to really make it stand the test of time like Doom, Duke 3D, and Quake have.","July 11, 2013","false","10.5"," 8 of 34 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","8","34","0","0"

ROTT is everything you could ever want in a video game, and more, though the shooters of today may have you believe otherwise.  Run around, shoot stuff, maybe turn into a dog, sometimes God, and one time a bouncy ball person.  It's still one of the best shooters out there and you owe it to yourself to play it.\n\nBlake Stone is also quite good, think Wolf 3D but with aliens, and scientists you can hold up for money, and lasers.  It's admittedly a bit hard going back to after all these years, but it's (and ROTT too) just as fun as I remember it.  Both games are bundled with their expansions/sequels, so that's great if you never got a chance to play them.  They're also playable right out of the gate, widescreen and all, with none of the tweaking needed for some of the other DOSBox versions you may find.\n\nComplaints?  It's DOSBox so the Steam overlay doesn't work correctly with it, other than that, some annoyances like the lack of an autosave and mouselook retain, but they're so insignificant they barely merit a mention.","July 4, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's less than 75 cents for each game\n\nYou get the 2 Rise of the Triad games and 2 Blake Stone games.\n\nBoth excellent, unique and innovative games in their own respect.\nGreat music and sound effects as well. The sounds that happen when you pick up items or when you fire a gun, or an enemy barks at you,... never ceases to surprise me.\nIt's never what you'd expect.\nSo much old school run and gun fun.\nAnd that old school humor too.\n\nI totally forgot about the death animations in Rise of the Triad!\nThose were so great! Made you excited to die just to see the animation play out.\n\nIf you've never played Blake Stone before, just remember this., not all scientists are bad. Just try talking to them, sometimes they're worth listening to.\n(sometimes they just need a bullet in the face though too..)\n\nPractically all the negative reviews on this game are about the control scheme using the arrow keys instead of the WASD.\nWell sorry, but old games didn't use WASD. The only reason WASD was invented is to make it easier to use the mouse. And back when these games were made, people didn't use mice to play games. These games were not designed to be used with a mouse.\nSo be warned before you buy.\nYou can use a mouse on Rise of the Triad. But it's not ideal.\n\nIt's never going to be ideal.. no matter how much you wish somebody would spend the time to make it possible for a mouse to be ideal when playing these games....no matter how much you fiddle with the controls....\n\nThey were simply just never designed with mice in mind.\nSo either get used to the old way of the FPS, or suffer.\n\nPeople like myself who grew up through this evolution shouldn't have much of a problem going back.\nIt's like riding a bike. Once you get your fingers on those arrow keys it will all come back to you.\n\nArrow Keys to move, Control key to shoot, alt to strafe, hold shift to run. That's basically all you need to know other than space to open doors.\n\nNow, stop your ♥♥♥♥♥in,  get out there, shoot some bad guys and pick up some loot.\n","February 25, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The amount of hours I spent on this game trying to find every secret door is ridiculous!!\n\nPROS:\n- SECRET DOORS!! Oh man... there are tons and tons of secret doors with gold and money and all sorts of goodies.  Secret doors within secret doors within secret doors!! Today's games are seriously lacking secret doors!!!\n- Very fun blood and gore 90's retro FPS.\n- Kill people for candy bars!!\n- If you like the original Doom and Wolfenstein 3D then you'll love this game (unless you don't...)\n\nCONS:\n- The controls are backwards 90's FPS... meaning you have to use the arrow keys, shift keys and space bars.  You can use your mouse which makes it better.\n- No Steam SHIFT-TAB screen (its a DOSBOX game).\n\nShort Story: It's 1993... I'm 7 years old and my mom got a hand me down PC from her work.  I wanted to  get a game for it but she wouldn't let me get Doom or Wolfenstein 3D because my Aunt let my older cousin get them and she said "OH MY GOD THEY'RE GAMES ABOUT PURE MURDER!!!! BLAH BLAH BLAH... 90'S ANTI VIDEO GAME PROPAGANDA... BLAH BLAH BLAH".  So I hear about this game called Blake Stone from another friend of mine, which at the time was very underated and unknown to parents.  It had all the  blood, the gore, the killing monsters and robots but no parent were raging on it yet because Doom and Wolfenstein took all the heat!  So I was able to convince my mom it wasn't bad and she bought it for me! I can't even imagine how many hours i spent playing this game.  Still holds up pretty well in fun factor considering how old it is.  If you love retro 90's FPSs then try this game out!!","May 14","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
