"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/275180/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Costume Quest 2 is the second game in this series developed by Double Fine Productions.  You play the role of two twin siblings, Reynold and Wren.  The game follows on from the original game in the story and offers much of the same game play elements.  The game has been released on PS3, 360, PS4, Xbox One, WiiU and all of the PC platforms.\n\nLike I said, the gameplay is very much the same as the first game, you travel around in your party exploring the world and encounter enemies, which you battle in a turn based fight scene. These fight scenes have an essence of QTEs in them, so if you hit the button at exactly the right time, you'll either do more damage, or block more damage. As you venture throughout the game, you will discover new and interesting costumes to wear - each costume has its own special ability and unique style of play.  There is some real interesting costumes to find, my favorite is the Clown costume, which acts as your early game healer, but you also have tanky classes and damage dealing classes like in other RPG games.\n\nGraphically, Costume Quest 2 is identical to the original. The art style is beautiful though, I loved the stylized world that you are put in and all of the characters just look gorgeous.  The animation in cut scenes and in the game are second to none too.  The game is so well optimized that pretty much any rig can play this in its full glory.\n\nThe plot is similar to the first game too; you are out to stop Dr. Orel White who has taken over the world and aims to bring an end to the holiday, Halloween! Obviously being the candy loving kids we all are, we can't let that happen and you must stop him.  With an element of time travel to be seen, there is some very interesting plot points throughout the game, and this comes with the inclusion of some brilliantly comical moments along the way too.\n\nSadly the game is not voice acted - for me I was hoping it would be given how popular the first game was, but this doesn't take away any of the charm the game has. You can pretty much imagine how each of the characters in the game would sound, and the animation of them all with the facial expressions aids this ten fold too.\n\nCostume Quest 2 has moments of difficulty; some of the quests are not easily figured out and you have to put a bit of thought into them, or working out where to go next in order to progress the game. Not to mention the boss battles can also get quite intensive too; I actually had to spend a fair amount of time grinding my characters up a few levels just so they were on par with the difficulty of the bosses I was facing. This is by no means a bad thing as with each fight you win, you also get the chance to win a card, which will have a unique effect that you can use in a battle, such as avoiding attacks, doing double damage, or sometimes actually out right killing an enemy no questions asked!\n\nThat brings me onto the level design, every single level in Costume Quest has absolutely tons of areas to explore and items to find. You have to destroy typical game world items in order to find the games currency, candy. The candy can the be spent at the vendors which are scattered around the world to purchase costume upgrades, or the above mentioned special effect cards. Each level also has a handful of side quests which you can complete, granting further experience points and candy as rewards. I would recommend people actually focus on the side quests before progressing in the main quest just so you keep up at the right level compared to the enemies. Some of the side quests are linked to the main quest; but a lot can be skipped over if you really want to.\n\nA full playthrough with completing the majority of the side quests at a leisurely pace took me just under nine hours to complete which is actually a bit of a jump in length compared to the original which only took me five hours to finish. Again though, there is no reason at all to play through Costume Quest 2 for a second time apart from maybe mopping up a few achievements if that's your jam. Much like the first, I would really of liked to have seen a "New Game+" mode just to squeeze a couple more hours out of it, and maybe introducing local co-op too, that would be an almost perfect addition given that you play as twins the whole way through the game.\n\nI had virtually no technical issues in my run through. I was able to play at 4K resolution with a steady 60 FPS the whole time. I did run into a few bugs where you could actually walk through some walls when interacting with items on the other side of the wall such as ladders and chests, but there are no real game breaking bugs to be found. I played the game with a controller given the amount of QTEs in the game, I felt that would be a better option, but this can just as easily be played with keyboard and mouse too.\n\nTo sum up, I think Costume Quest 2 does exactly the same as the Costume Quest just bigger and better. I can only hope that there is going to be a third game in this series as it just gets better and better with each release. I will go as far to say this is one of my favorite games I have played this year so it gets a strong recommendation from me!\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/recommended/275180/","xelios","Xelios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/","4978 products in account","Costume Quest 2 is Costume Quest with time travel and enhanced graphics, and that's not hyperbole. Many assets, including costumes, are recycled and the neighborhoods are likely to induce deja vu in those who played the original. The few adjustments that have been made are of little consequence so, if you enjoyed Costume Quest and wanted more of the same, you'll enjoy this; on the other hand, if you felt it began to drag and become repetitive, or that battles were tedious, you will feel it again here and sooner. For those who haven't played either, there's no reason you can't start with this one.\n\nThe story in Costume Quest 2 revolves around a group of kids who must utilize time travel to deal with the results of a mother obsessed with keeping her son's teeth in perfect condition; that is, save Halloween from being outlawed by the deranged dentist he becomes. To accomplish this, you'll need to skate around neighborhoods completing quests, knocking on doors and beating up baddies for candy that can be used to buy maps, costume upgrades and battle abilities. Some costumes grant powers that are needed to access secret areas or progress the story, and you can switch between them at any time while not in combat.\n\nCombat begins with your characters morphing into giant versions of whatever costumes they're wearing and is turn-based, with QTEs for enhanced damage, blocking and combos. Whether it's Thomas Jefferson and his special attack, the Declaration of Destruction; generic robots and superheroes; or a useless candy corn that's still trying to find his courage, it's all amusing and the animations are nicely done. The biggest improvement that could have been made to the game, but wasn't, would no doubt involve the length and repetition of battles and QTEs.\n\nOverall, Costume Quest 2 is a light-hearted, humorous, feel-good game that, when played by someone new to the series, should make up for in charm what it lacks in depth. I can easily recommend it to newcomers and lovers of the first title; for those who thought Costume Quest was nothing more than fair, don't expect this to change your mind: Double Fine didn't attempt to in the slightest.","October 8, 2014","true","9.1"," 93 of 117 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","93","117","0","4"

Removed the post battle healing and force you to backtrack to a water fountain to heal  waaaay too frequently which can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ in unfamiliar territory. No maps provided of new areas unless you buy it. Even with the map there is no indication of your current location. Battle stamps (passive upgrades) have been removed and a new buff system using Creepy Treats cards as in battle items takes their place.

Much of the story would make little sense on it's own.  It seems the developer assumes you've played the previous game and doesn't try to fill in the blanks too much.  (Don't worry, it's worth it to play CQ before CQ2.)  My review also assumes you're familiar with the first game.\n\nthe Good:  - cute graphics, Halloween atmosphere\n- witty dialoge\n- fun gameplay, more complex battle system\n- lots of exploration\n- good story\n- many new and upgradable costumes\n\nthe Bad:  - main menu is quite annoying, call me old-fashioned but I prefer simple, efficient text on the screen\n\nIt's rare to see a holiday-specific game, but like those familiar Christmas songs, Costume Quest has become a tradition among it's fans.  Much like the first game, Costume Quest 2 is simple, fun, and charming.  The battle system has been refined to better engage the player with combo attacks and timed button presses.  Health sometimes needs to be replenished after battles this time, adding a bit of difficulty, and the collectible card power ups have been re-tooled forcing more strategery.\n\nIn short, this is everything that made Costume Quest great with increased variety and the welcome addition of more complexity.  Is it time for Halloween?  Long for a little Trick-or-Treat nostalgia?  Then it's time to play Costume Quest 2.\n\n(BTW, if this type of game interests you I'd also recommend Saturday Morning RPG)","October 7, 2014","true","17.1"," 86 of 130 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","86","130","0","0"

It surprised me, i was not expecting Costume quest 2. I loved the first game and i instantly fell in love with this one. Again you play as the very cute little kids (i know it sounds creepy coming from a grown man) and running in halloween costumes fighting giant angry moles and snails.\n\nThe game didn‘t change much. The core is the same. Simple rpg mechanics, collecting candies, leveling up, collecting new costumes to become a three-headed hotdog.\n\nThe combat system changed a little, you now need to press a button when attacking to do more damage and same goes for defending – press the button in time to receive less damage. And there‘s fountains where you can restore your health after the fights. I heard people complaining about it, but i don‘t see the problem here, fountains are always close to you, it‘s easy to go and refill you hp. Other than that the game is same as the previous one – great. Yes it‘s very short, but i don‘t know if i would want to play it for 30 hours.\n\nDouble fine has done a fine job here.

If you don't, I don't care, I'll just change into an actual superhero and beat the candy out of you, you creepy monster!\n\nIf you've played the first Costume Quest, then you know exactly what you're in for- kids beating the crud out of monsters for halloween candy.  But this time... there's more to it than just "the bad monsters want to steal away our candy".  Nope, this time, there's a new villain in town... the one person who has more reason to hate candy than any one other person in the whole city...\n\n...the creepy local dentist.\n\nIn fact, he hates it so much that he's somehow managed to make it to where Halloween, candy, and costumes are crimes against his order, and he's recruited the Repugians to help enforce his views.  It's up to Wren and Reynold to put a stop to it, and save Halloween for future generations.\n\nTo be quite honest, this is just as good as the first one- battles are a tad bit more complicated with a bit of Pokemon-style type weakness mixed in, but you'll pick up on that easily enough.  Stickers are also gone, replaced with Creepy Treats cards that recharge after a certain number of battles.  The automatic healing after every battle has been removed too- but it's not as terrible as it sounds, honestly.  You either need to camp out around a water fountain to keep healed, or finally put that candy to more use than just as a currency- you can fully heal your party for 25 pieces of candy, or use it to buy upgrades and cards.\n\nTo be honest, the new costumes you get in this one may not be as powerful as some of the originals- for instance, the Unicorn's My Pretty Panacea special is still brokenly powerful compared to the revive you get without the preorder- but the right combinations are still very, very powerful.\n\nEnemies are no longer a finite resource- there are respawning enemies in all the areas of the game in addition to the ones in the usual places, so if you just feel like sitting somewhere and grinding levels, you can do that, too.  To be honest, though, you don't need a super-high level to beat the game- I finished it around level 9, with the Hardcorn achievement, even.\n\nSome of the late-game random encounters need a specific strategy- you'll run into a group that can drop a group heal every turn, if they so choose, and if you don't destroy them in a specific order, they'll tear you apart.\n\nIt might need a little balancing in the late game, but overall, if you have the first one, you can expect more of the same fun that was in the first one- or you could just outright buy the first one as well and play through that if you want to!  If you didn't play the first one, that's still fine- you might not understand some of the story elements, but you'll like the great gameplay and all the fun!","October 24, 2014","true","8.9"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","28","37","0","0"

It's just a shame I finished the game before finding it because after discovering it I had no use for it... I tested out it's special move and thought it would of been cool to fight the final boss with it again, but he was already a push over.\n\nThe Candy Corn achievement is just gruling and brutal because of all the quips you have to endure every time that characters turn comes up but in the long run it does you a favor... Using Candy Corn slows the pace of the game to a crawl because you lose one of your fighters for the entire duration of the game but it helps tremendously during boss fights and even more especially during the final fight.\n\nThe music and design is nothing to gawk at... just more of the same except now you can double attack and use counter attacks... The buff badges have been removed and the creepy treat cards were given more utility...\n\nSo now you can actually use them for something other than staring at but I didn't want to waste any in fear that I might lose out on the collection achievement... so that was a waste of resources if I've ever seen one... I never needed to utilze a single card the entire time playing.\n\nEither way, it wasn't their best effort, could of been better... I did enjoy it regardless of the lack of content but it didn't stray too far from the original in terms of innovation... just another copy and paste sequel.","October 8, 2014","false","7.9"," 72 of 124 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","72","124","2","0"

Not only to get the whole story but because I feel it was overall a better game.

Even leaving the game takes time. It's still funny, it's still charming, combat became a little more interesting and challenging than the first game. I enjoyed it at the end, though much less than the original. Another issue I had is that only pre-order costumers got the DLC with some costume from the previous game, and while I'm ok with rewarding people who bought it first I'd like to see them as a purchasable DLC in the future.","November 1, 2014","true","9.7"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","17","25","0","0"

It's fine though I guess but one other thing that bothers me is that combat takes a long time because you have a follow up attack on each attack that you can do, enemies have a lot of hp, and all attacks from you and the enemies take longer than in most games. Although I wish combat was quicker, it isn't too bad, especially since this is the type of game you only ever really play through once.

Worth playing? Yes. But compared to the first game, this game definitely made some bad decisions. I can see why critics gave this game such low reviews. They oversimplified the battle system, requiring only one button and the same "time your attack" mechanic. The dumb aspect is that they mapped each character to a different button, which is completely pointless. A lot of the new costumes are cool, but they share a lot of the same abilities from the first game. I didn't preorder so I didn't get the DLC bonus costumes, but no worry. They're ones you already played in the first game and you'll probably prefer the new ones anyways. I liked how the 3rd child in your party was changing throughout the game. I like the ability to upgrade your costumes, but I disliked the new card system.  Instead of equipping stamps for different effects, you can only choose 3 cards to bring into battle. Once used, they need a cooldown of X battles to use again. The only reason I used all of them was to complete an Achievement.

I’m one of those killjoys who rolls her eyes at the Halloween decorations the shops insist on trotting out and flogging to a mostly disinterested British audience every year. I managed to work my way through my formative years without it playing any part in my yearly routine. I never went trick or treating, or ‘glorified begging’ as I was told it was. I’ve never really done fancy dress in any big way either. In fact I’ve probably put more effort into making costumes for my hedgehog soft toys than I have for myself. Costume Quest 2 lets me precariously live out my repressed need to threaten strangers into giving me sweets and dress up in increasingly deranged outfits whilst hitting monsters, which I assume is standard Halloween behaviour for those inclined.\n\nCostume Quest was a game that impressed me immensely. It was simple in places but filled with all the wonderful charm and wit that Double Fine have built their reputation on. Like Psychonauts (another game I love), Costume Quest is a game about being a kid, doing kid stuff and seeing the world in a fantastical way that the adults around them just cannot do. It’s silly and quirky without coming across as pandering or dumbed down. On the contrary, Costume Quest had some really clever writing. Despite my Halloween-cynicism, I was strangely excited about the prospect of Costume Quest 2 (especially after seeing the wonderful announcement trailer).\n\nAfter stopping monsters stealing all the Halloween candy, brother and sister team Wren and Reynold are preparing to finally enjoy some trick or treating Halloween fun. But would you believe it, an evil dentist has changed history to outlaw the festival. The simple premise belies the sharpness of the writing and the sheer joy of finding all the gags and japes the game has to offer. There is always something happening on screen, be it a quick one liner or a visual gag going on in the background. It seems there is no wasted space in the game world, everything has a purpose. I adored the art style that lead designer Tasha Harris gave the first game, I’m very pleased to see that the sequel has added to it in the best way, keeping the style consistent as new characters are introduced and fresh costumes take centre stage. The game looks brilliant, being so full of colour and life as it is with some well thought out areas to explore.\n\nIt plays almost exactly as its predecessor. Costume Quest was never the most challenging of games in terms of gameplay, which is fair, not every game needs to be a hardcore l33t ultra noob-smasher pain-a-thon. I always enjoyed the gentler style Costume Quest took but it would have been nice to have the sequel mix things up a bit more to stop it becoming too repetitive or overly familiar. Very little has changed. The meat of the game is divided betwixt two scenarios; knocking on doors to trick or treat and seeing if you get candy or a fight, and then there is the fighting. It’s not a bad system but one that gets a bit too predictable the longer the game goes on. The fighting in particular runs close to becoming tedious after a while. Two parties line up and take turns hitting each other until one party has lost all its health points, it’s a time honoured system but one that wears itself pretty thin when it’s limited to a few characters with the same moves and little involvement from the player.\n\nThe combat system has had a bit of tweaking though. The button timing mechanic for attacking opponents has been streamlined slightly to make it more consistent over the various costumes and there is a more effective block/counter-attack move to be learned. However you’ll be performing the same actions so many times in combat you become numb to them. The joy of seeing the kids you play as transform into literal representations of their costumes and fight giant monsters or robots loses its impact after the hundredth fight or so. The special moves your characters can use are amusing (the clown’s ‘laughter is the best medicine’ is my favourite), but even they become tiresome the more you see them. There are some enemies that certain costumes are stronger or weaker against, but I never found myself needing to worry about it so much and just used the costumes I liked best or had upgraded most recently. You also need to heal your party after fights otherwise damage taken rolls over to the next battle, but even this was never an issue I needed to adjust my tactics for. You can just eat some candy at any point to replenish health or visit a water fountain.\n\nIn the end, combat started to become the tedious bits in between the story and exploring. As slight as the fetch quests and trick or treating that make up the bulk of the non-fighting sections are, I still did it all with a big grin on my face. The world is just so cute and charming that I was irresistibly compelled to play on and poke my nose into every little corner of the game. The story was enjoyably bizarre and presented well (it follows on directly from the CQ1 DLC, Grubbins on Ice). It’s frequently very funny and features a twist that had me giggling so much I dropped my controller. I spent a silly amount of time running around being a jerk honking a loud clown horn in people’s face, trying to initiate diplomatic talks with everyone and hitting alligators with candy buckets. That this is a game that encourages such childishness can only be a good thing in my opinion.\n\nIt may not be for everyone, but if you’re after a game that captures the child like glee of getting caught up in an insane festival, then Costume Quest 2 may be for you.

The game plays pretty close to the original.  The game isn't really hard and anyone should be able to pick it up and enjoy it.  The costumes in this version are memorable and none of them repeat from the original unless you pre-ordered or they release the DLC.  I thought the storyline in this met my expectations of a sequel.  You play the kids from the original and they time travel to stop an evil dentist from destroying Halloween.  This time both the brother and sister are teamed up.  You still have to make a decision in the beginning on which one gets the dialogue throughout the story though.

To me Costume Quest 2 on its own is a decent and good game but in case you played the first one, you might have mixed feelings.\n\nI played both games. My opinion: I don't understand why they changed the battle-system. You don't have the different attack meters anymore, the cards you get need to be activated during the battle and do not give passive bonuses, you should heal after every fight (either with a ability or the fountain which caused me to run back to the fountain all the time).\nThose are my points i didn't like. On The other hand though: The story is still good and funny at times and the little quests too. Plus, you can constantly skate now.

Cute, fun and now a bit more challenging. I played the game twice because I realize there was an achievement to finish through the whole game with one of your party members wearing the candycorn costume, which is a bit more challenging.\n\nThe story takes place immediately after the first game (not gonna go any further discussion about the story because I dun want to give spoilers), though I have to say they could have a little bit more depth to the story. The whole game is almost the same to the first one, but with a number of additional gimmicks and changes:\n\n1) All the characters now have the same button prompt unlike the previous game where they all have a variety of it;\n2) You can now attack again after a successful attack, and also there are levels of damage depending on your timing;\n3) You can now defend and counter;\n4) Once you flee, you will teleport auto-matically to a healing-well-thingy, which follow up to my next point...\n5) You can now heal and save at a healing-well-drinking-thingy, not a ignorant police phone booth;\n6) You will have a lot of cards to use in battle to act as an battle-equalizer, because the fights are a lot harder than the first game\n7) You can now move faster in any costume, unlike the first game which is the ability for the robot costume;\n8) Costumes and enemies now have effectiveness typing, kinda like rock scissors paper. They are Monster, Magic and Mech types.\n\nThats all the things I can think of for now.\n\nThe game is now more challenging, which is good. The characters are still adorable and lovable, and the attack prompts in battle feels more respondsive. The main menu though, I wish they would just stick to the simple looking menu rather than what it is now, but oh well. Overall not bad for a sequal.\n","January 3, 2015","true","13.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/275180/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","Costume Quest 2 is the sequel to the original turn-based soft RPG made by Double Fine around 2012. It continues the story of the two twins Reynold and Wren exactly where the last DLC for the first title ended: after managing to return to their own time, they must resort to time travel to stop the evil plan of Dr. Orel White, a dentist bent on destroying Halloween for good and rule the whole world.\nGameplay-wise, Costume Quest 2 doesn't differ that much from the first game's formula, but manages to tweak several elements along the way. The combat is the feature that recived the greatest overhaul: while the whole turn-based RPG fare with QTEs for extra damage is still there, now the health of the characters doesn't refill itself after combat (forcing you to visit fountains scatterd in the areas or consume a stock of candy to heal up), your attacks can either be nice or amazing and dish out damage accordingly regarding when precisely you press the attack button, you can defend yourself and try to counterattack via QTEs, chains of attacks are available and enemies tend to hurt a bit more and some will respawn to free roam the streets again. The sequel also introduces three classes for enemies and costumes alike, Tech, Wizard and Monster: there is a little weakness/resistance system going on between each to put some emphasis on gear and target choice. Finally, this time around  you can actually buy upgrades for your costume, which either empower the character's attacks or add some useful side effects. While these novelties make the first encounters you'll face very challenging and requiring some demanding good timing, as you progress through Costume Quest 2 and gain the roughly ten levels there are to get you'll become more and more powerful and get used to the QTEs general flow, to the point of making most of the battles trivia (the bosses in this game are especially disappointing because, unlike the first game, they don't display any unique gimmick and all boil down to a very easy dps race).\nAside from the combat, eveything you left in Costume Quest returns in the sequel as you'd expect: in the roughly three main areas you'll visit in the second game there a lot of doors to knock on for trick or treating, obstacles to overcome with the right costume, collectable cards that give you a pletora of effects in combat and a huge crowd of NPCs to interact with. The writing is still funny and charming as you remembered.\nIn short, Costume Quests 2 is a fairly good attempt as a sequel and feel free to buy it if you enjoyed the first game\n","April 2, 2015","true","7.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Many of the assest in Costume Quest 2 are reused from the first. Many of the villians are copied right from the first and changed ever so slighly, like giving one monster a lab coat, TADA!!!, totally a new mob. Another big downside is how worthless some of the costumes are. Many of them felt like they fit the same roles and it was pointless to switch out much besides in open world puzzles. For example the clown, pharaoh and the unicorn. The clown for the whole first half of the game beat the unicorn and Pharaoh by miles in the healing department. The Pharaoh, you get so late into the game, I no longer died and needed her resurrection heals. However after upgrading the unicorn, the clown become useless. The upgraded clowns AoE heal was = to the unicorns, but the unicorn also healed one extra party member for quite a bit more. The best part about Costume Quest 2 is the story. The humor in the game is spot on, and I loved all of the characters and how many jokes they fit in, for the kids and for the adults. Sadly five hours into the game I was already sick of the combat, and just wanted to move onto the next story section. I would suggest Costume Quest 2 for anyone who loved the first, or just want a kid friendly non-spooky Halloween game to play this time of year. For anyone else looking for a deep RPG, or fun combat, I would look some place else.","October 11, 2014","true","9.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The Costume Quest games are unique little adventure titles that are sprinkled with RPG elements. Both games center around Halloween and, of course, the act of Trick-or-Treating. Costume Quest 2 picks up where its predecessor left off in terms of story, and it expands on all of the elements that players will be familiar with from the first game.\n\nWithout spoiling the main plot, I can say that you will take on the role of the brother/sister duo, Reynold and Wren. You will be tasked with regaining a talisman in order to save the world from a most disturbing fate of a candy-less future. Throughout the course of the game, you will have a few friends to accompany you on your journey; effectively turning your party from a duo to a trio. Having three party members comes in extremely handy across the numerous main and side quests that you will encounter. From knocking on doors to Trick-or-Treat and possibly running into enemies, to free roaming enemies, to helping find lost Hide n' Seek kids, the quests are enjoyably easy.\n\nEach character is able to equip the various costumes that you will unlock whilst playing the game; from a wizard to a pharaoh, a clown and a werewolf, and many more. Each costume comes with its own unique attack, special ability, strength and weakness; all of which makes it essential that the player equips their party with the appropriate costume from area to area. You will earn experience points and candy (which is used as currency) after each battle. Candy can be spent on purchasing costume upgrades and special cards, which brings me to my next point.\n\nThe cards in this game act as battle stamps did in the original Costume Quest. If you never played that game, it's simply an extra element that introduces more factors into combat. Where one card can revive a player at 50% health, another card can cause a character to attack twice per turn. There are 45 in total, and you can equip 3 at a time; using them can often move a seemingly hopeless battle into your favor. There are some massively overpowered cards, such as one that will kill all minions, which cause the game to become rather easy at a certain point. However, the cards also have cool downs that expire after a set number of battles.\n\nThe soundtrack to this game is fantastic, and given that you rarely go back to previous areas the tunes just do not get old. The game mechanics are also extremely smooth, and the game itself runs at a stable 60 frames with no hitches. The graphics themselves are cute, fun and simple, and it's always exciting to see what your costume will look like in battle once you've unlocked a new one or have spent your candy on an upgrade for it.\n\nCostume Quest 2 is an outstanding follow up to its debut title, in every way imaginable. Double Fine even put a few new elements into the combat system to give it a slightly fresher feel. The story is satisfying from start to finish, and it definitely doesn't let down its audience at the end. I highly recommend this game to fans of the original Costume Quest, or for anyone who is looking for a fresh, fun little adventure game that will last around 8-9 hours. Although I do suggest if you have not played Costume Quest 1, you pick that game up first so that you have more of an understanding of the story.\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","January 12","true","8.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

It's a bit weird (But then again, so was the story of the first game). However, I think the first game had more charm. It was about halloween and monsters rather than time traveling dentist dystopias. Not bad but not really good either\n\nGameplay\nIt's been gutted and changed. You still only have one basic attack and one special attack. However, now it involves timing and your damage depends on how close you hit it to the indicator. You can also block and counter although they have their own disadvantages. The one thing that I really didn't like is that the status cards are no longer applied to characters. Instead, you have to play them in game (which wastes a turn). This turns down the amount of customization each characters has (which is already pretty low) and I wish they really didn't change it.\n\nGraphics/Performance\nThe game ran at a smooth 60 with a 4790K, GTX 970, and 16GB of ram. It looks much better than the previous game (Especially the water reflections). When you zoom into a character, it looks a bit.. cartoony but that's just the play style.\n\nFinal thoughts.\nOverall, it's basically part 2 of a game with a different combat engine. It wasn't bad but there is just so much freaking combat and it gets old really fast. I was just rushing through to finish it and didn't want to do the side quests like the first game.

In some ways it's a little disappointing that this is so close to the original game. Combat is a little bit better and the treats cards are more useful but overall exactly the same as the first game. The format of going to different areas and trick or treating is the same as well but I find it very fun and don't mind it at all. Also, I'm a little surprised that the game didn't expand into new territory in terms of holiday themes. The first game was obviously Fall but the DLC Grubbins on Ice was set in the Winter and had Christmas themes and references. So I expected this to continue that theme and have Spring themes or Easter references, something like that but instead it returns to the original Halloween Fall theme. Which makes a lot of sense I suppose since it is the original premise for the game and where most of the themes come from.\n\nThat said though, when the game was starting I was sort of disappointed in the way it looked like the story was being set up. A dentist wants to end Halloween and make candy illegal so everyone can have clean teeth so it's up to the kids to save Halloween. Are you kidding me? That's the most cliched holiday plot I've ever heard. So, I had a bad taste in my mouth starting out. However, I was really won over. The writing is very good. The side quests have really good plots and are fun to do and everything about the cliched main storyline ending up being better than I expected. The evil dentist ends up being a very tragic figure and ends up having a great character arc.\n\nIf you're a fine of Double Fine and their writing style this is a very fun game and despite how much it repeats the first oen the combat and overall gameplay is a lot of fun.

It's not deep by any means, but it was enough to sustain my interest over the 6 hours or so that it took me to see the end. It was also good to see special meter retained between battles, although the retaining of damage between battles mainly just provided a chore of going back to water fountains regularly to recharge. Luckily, there's pretty much always one nearby.\n\nElsewhere the game has all the charm we've come to expect. A graphical uplift makes the already lovely, stylised visuals even sharper, and the time-travelling plot provides opportunity for a wide variety of locations. Peter McConnell is back for the soundtrack, which stood out to me as one of his finest, with the themes in the past area making particularly fine use of slide guitar.\n\nThe humour is endearing rather than uproarous, which suits the tone of the game well. It would have been nice if they'd had a budget for voice acting, as I'd love to hear this world come to life in that way, but we can't have it all.\n\nOver all, a highly successful sequel which doesn't do too much to the formula, but makes smart changes where it can and doesn't overstay its welcome.","October 8, 2014","true","7.5"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","17","33","0","0"

The sequel continues the story where the original game left off with the same characters. The sequel did not have the same Halloween vibe as the first one did for me, which made going through the game not as enjoyable as I wished. If you enjoyed the first one it's worth playing the second one, however if you could barely get through the first one then I would recommend avoiding the sequel. Overall, it was pleasant to see the Costume Quest storyline continued in a sequel however it does feel like a large expansion pack rather than a sequel on its own.","October 31, 2014","true","10.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I think it's an absolute joke that Double Fine are allowed to include that Apple icon in the description.\n\nI adored Costume Quest, but there are many changes in the sequel that haven't improved the game and the new controls make it very uncomfortable to play. For example, WASD has replaced the arrow keys for movement. Fine, but when you have to use E to pail-bash and Shift to skate, my left hand is doing way too much work and my right hand is just hanging out at home like it's not invoted to the party. It's painful.\n\nThe fight sequences are dull now. They've tried to add more features but for some reason it just feels more repetitive. I havent even got as far as using the treat cards in fights due to how frustrating the controls are.\n\nTo top it all off, on A Mac the entire right third of the screen is...well I don't know what's going on there but it ain't working. It's black or greyed out. I have to change the resolution to fix it. Every. Time. I play.\n\nI feel like I've tried my best with it but, no. What a massive disappointment.

The original Costume Quest was one of my favorite games of all time, so the changes that were made to gameplay weren't all that welcome at first. As I played the game, though, and let go of my prejudice, I discovered a really great game with a cute story and some really cool mechanics. While I'm not sure it surpasses the first game, it does serve as a good continuation of the Costume Quest tale. While I may have gone into this game shy, I had grown to thoroughly love it by the end. I have a feeling I will be playing through it every Halloween along with the original and Grubbins on Ice, and I'm really happy to have it in my collection.\n\nPros:\n+Really cute story, with well-written characters and an enjoyable story arc\n+Picks up right where the first game and DLC leave off. The continuation feels nicely organic.\n+Costume upgrades were a nice touch, both in how they improve the costumes and the physical changes that occur\n+Classic Double Fine humor\n+The musical score fits really well with the game, and functions better in places than the original in my opinion\n+All characters can use the skate shoes now\n+Some of the new costumes are simply fantastic\n+Candy Corn\n\nNeutral:\n=The game can be short if you don't explore endlessly or grind for candy and experience\n=The game bosses seem underwhelming compared to the first, and don't put up much of a challenge\n=Somewhat requires you to have played the first game and the original DLC\n=The new Paper Mario style combat is a wild departure from the first. I think I preferred the original combat as the different costumes required different combat quick time events, but the combo system in this version is welcome.\n\nCons:\n-The new Creepy Treat card mechanic isn't as much fun for me as the old battle stamps\n-You no longer auto-heal after combat, meaning you're always running back to a fountain to heal. There is an option to eat candy to heal instead, but it never seems worth the cost until after you've bought everything you can.\n-No bobbing for apples game","October 12, 2014","true","17.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/halfalloyphysicist/recommended/275180/","halfalloyphysicist","Halfalloy Physicist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/halfalloyphysicist/","264 products in account","Costume Quest 2 is superior to the original, as it improves upon many of the gameplay mechanics that it introduced. Here's what CQ2 boasts:\n\n+ A new combat system.\nAnyone who's played CQ1 will tell you that that game's battle system was not the most exciting. It required you to perform quick time events to increase the damage output of your attack or the damage reduction of your block. Instead, CQ2 now requires you to press a single button at a precise moment to do the same. This sounds terrible but actually the timing is brutal with its precision and messing it up can and will screw you over, especially when you get into the realms of needed precise timing to be able to do counter attacks and double hits.\nThat said, much like the original CQ, you will run on autopilot eventually, as the precise timing will soon turn into muscle memory.\n\n+ Many different areas.\nThis is either a hit or a miss, as the original CQ had only three areas, however each area was unique and really well made. In CQ2, there are now several areas that can sometimes seem a bit samey. They're all great to look at, but do sometimes feel like a chore to navigate.\nThe new addition of maps is fantastic, and I've heard complaints of people saying they would prefer it if the map told you where you were, but I didn't mind that. What I had a problem with was that the maps looked like ♥♥♥♥, but once you orientate it in your head, finding your position is easy.\n\n+ Enemy classes.\nThe original CQ had four uncredited enemy classes: ranged, melee, support magic and offensive magic. Here, they are now monster, tech and magic (the two magic classes have been fused together so healers can now cause lots of damage, as if they weren't irritating enough!). The relevance of this is that each costume has a class that it is stronger against (will do more and take less damage) and weak against (will do less and take more damage). This is actually quite a nice addition as I used to prioritise enemies to eliminate with my strongest costumes and then finish off the weaker ones with my weaker costumes, but now the game is forcing me to do that and it's much easier to figure out how it all works.\n\n+ Many new costumes.\nSome of them are just reskinned old ones, the ghost is the ninja, the pharaoh is the pirate and unicorn, and even the new hotdog and wizard seem similar to each other. But they do work differently by now having new costume specialisations. As well as healing, attacking and defense, you also have splash damage and ressurection costumes, among others.\n\n+ Upgradable costumes.\nCostumes can be upgraded for a large sum of candy by talking to Shady. It's unclear when upgrades are available or how they are unlocked, but they are useful, acting as permanent buffs and changing the model of the costume slightly.\n\n+ The robot's skate ability is now in every costume.\n'Nuff said.\n\n+ Useful Creepy Treats Cards.\nGone are battle stamps, my friend, Creepy Treats Cards are all the rage now! Every Creepy Treats Card has an effect that can be activated in battle, which requires a cooldown to be used in later battles. You swap out which cards you take into battle outside of combat in your logbook. The effects are more interesting than the old battle stamps, such as "Next minion to attack this hero is defeated", "Double XP at the end of battle" and "Mute a minion's magic attacks" to name but a few. I mostly used the 'double XP' and 'instant death upon attacking hero X' ones and wasn't particularly interested in the others. I will say I preffered the art design for the Creepy Treats Cards from the original CQ.\n\n+ Story.\nThe story continues immediately after Grubbins on Ice, and if you thought the first two stories were ridiculous, take a gander at this one. Dr. White the dentist has made a deal with a Time Wizard to go back in time to when he was a child to steal a talisman from two witches in a bog that used to exist before Auburn Pines which stops monsters from Repugia entering the human world so he can create his metropolis of a clean teeth utopia and rid the world of Halloween and candy forever.\nSounds ridiculous but its actually very interesting to watch and its great to be along for the ride. What's more, I have a soft spot for watching characters I know and love grow up, and CQ2 nails that when you travel to the future and meet a married Lucy and Everett.\n\nWith all of that said, CQ2 isn't perfect. There is a big black hideous tumour growing on the side of its face, resembling an awful new game mechanic that wasn't needed and really detracts from the experience. Those who have played CQ2 know I'm talking about the fountain drinking.\nYour health does not recover after battle, unless you level up. So to recover your health to full, you have to drink from a water fountain. This means that every couple of battles you will have to backtrack to the nearest fountain just to have a drink, only to go back to where you were and continue.

You will have no idea what's going on if you don't, as it starts directly after the end of Grubbin's on Ice.\n\nIt feels just like the first one too, in the best and worst way possible. It follows the same formula that the original game does, so it just feels more like more of the same. While that's not entirely a bad thing, it does make the game forgettable and it makes you feel like you've already done everything before.\n\nIf you enjoyed the first one, you'll likely enjoy this one too, but maybe not quite as much.","October 16, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story seems less Halloween-centric even though it says it is, it loses some spirit trying to add scale. The sequel also relies on hints, tells, and story elements that are very dependent on the first game making it feel like it cant stand on its own.\n\nCostume Quest 2 feels like the DLC for Costume Quest 1 did, sorta tacked together in the same world but not as much heart or attention put in it, its the little things that seemed to be missed or stand out, unlike the original (I'm not talking graphics persee)\n\nI truly feel something was lost, I chuckled or smiled a bit in Costume Quest 2, but I played Costume Quest not a week before, and I was smiling and laughing my butt off. It just felt drawn out after a while, and a great example of this, compared to the last fights of Costume Quest 1, which were awesome and funny and sorta epic, the last fight, heck most of the boss fights in 2 were sorta boring, leaving me pining for more.\n\nThat isn't to say Costume Quest 2 isn't good, they try to shake up the combat a bit and have different ways to power up your characters and it has many many many nods to the original game, almost to the point of head scratching at times. I think the game sorta took itself too seriously, even though it was also being ridiculous. Also, I can see they were trying to make the game "more rewarding through skill" but in so doing, they made the game dismally easy in the process.\n\nI have a feeling, and this is my opinion, that this game may have been DLC for the original, based on the content (aka, the excessive reuse) I witnessed.\n\nAll in all, the style and shading and detail has changed a little bit, subjectively to its detrement or benefit, and the game plays in a more active fashion than before, making the player react more during turns than the original. Engine wise and concept wise it actually has not greatly progressed from the original and I beat the game with a feeling that this was "expanded DLC" of the original, it uses and relies on the original too much to consider it as it's own game, really.\n\nCostume Quest is a game that revels in Halloween, the sequel does not, and though it is not bad, it doesn't fufil my cravings like the original did.","October 15, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/halfalloyphysicist/recommended/275180/","halfalloyphysicist","Halfalloy Physicist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/halfalloyphysicist/","264 products in account","Costume Quest 2 is superior to the original, as it improves upon many of the gameplay mechanics that it introduced. Here's what CQ2 boasts:\n\n+ A new combat system.\nAnyone who's played CQ1 will tell you that that game's battle system was not the most exciting. It required you to perform quick time events to increase the damage output of your attack or the damage reduction of your block. Instead, CQ2 now requires you to press a single button at a precise moment to do the same. This sounds terrible but actually the timing is brutal with its precision and messing it up can and will screw you over, especially when you get into the realms of needed precise timing to be able to do counter attacks and double hits.\nThat said, much like the original CQ, you will run on autopilot eventually, as the precise timing will soon turn into muscle memory.\n\n+ Many different areas.\nThis is either a hit or a miss, as the original CQ had only three areas, however each area was unique and really well made. In CQ2, there are now several areas that can sometimes seem a bit samey. They're all great to look at, but do sometimes feel like a chore to navigate.\nThe new addition of maps is fantastic, and I've heard complaints of people saying they would prefer it if the map told you where you were, but I didn't mind that. What I had a problem with was that the maps looked like ♥♥♥♥, but once you orientate it in your head, finding your position is easy.\n\n+ Enemy classes.\nThe original CQ had four uncredited enemy classes: ranged, melee, support magic and offensive magic. Here, they are now monster, tech and magic (the two magic classes have been fused together so healers can now cause lots of damage, as if they weren't irritating enough!). The relevance of this is that each costume has a class that it is stronger against (will do more and take less damage) and weak against (will do less and take more damage). This is actually quite a nice addition as I used to prioritise enemies to eliminate with my strongest costumes and then finish off the weaker ones with my weaker costumes, but now the game is forcing me to do that and it's much easier to figure out how it all works.\n\n+ Many new costumes.\nSome of them are just reskinned old ones, the ghost is the ninja, the pharaoh is the pirate and unicorn, and even the new hotdog and wizard seem similar to each other. But they do work differently by now having new costume specialisations. As well as healing, attacking and defense, you also have splash damage and ressurection costumes, among others.\n\n+ Upgradable costumes.\nCostumes can be upgraded for a large sum of candy by talking to Shady. It's unclear when upgrades are available or how they are unlocked, but they are useful, acting as permanent buffs and changing the model of the costume slightly.\n\n+ The robot's skate ability is now in every costume.\n'Nuff said.\n\n+ Useful Creepy Treats Cards.\nGone are battle stamps, my friend, Creepy Treats Cards are all the rage now! Every Creepy Treats Card has an effect that can be activated in battle, which requires a cooldown to be used in later battles. You swap out which cards you take into battle outside of combat in your logbook. The effects are more interesting than the old battle stamps, such as "Next minion to attack this hero is defeated", "Double XP at the end of battle" and "Mute a minion's magic attacks" to name but a few. I mostly used the 'double XP' and 'instant death upon attacking hero X' ones and wasn't particularly interested in the others. I will say I preffered the art design for the Creepy Treats Cards from the original CQ.\n\n+ Story.\nThe story continues immediately after Grubbins on Ice, and if you thought the first two stories were ridiculous, take a gander at this one. Dr. White the dentist has made a deal with a Time Wizard to go back in time to when he was a child to steal a talisman from two witches in a bog that used to exist before Auburn Pines which stops monsters from Repugia entering the human world so he can create his metropolis of a clean teeth utopia and rid the world of Halloween and candy forever.\nSounds ridiculous but its actually very interesting to watch and its great to be along for the ride. What's more, I have a soft spot for watching characters I know and love grow up, and CQ2 nails that when you travel to the future and meet a married Lucy and Everett.\n\nWith all of that said, CQ2 isn't perfect. There is a big black hideous tumour growing on the side of its face, resembling an awful new game mechanic that wasn't needed and really detracts from the experience. Those who have played CQ2 know I'm talking about the fountain drinking.\nYour health does not recover after battle, unless you level up. So to recover your health to full, you have to drink from a water fountain. This means that every couple of battles you will have to backtrack to the nearest fountain just to have a drink, only to go back to where you were and continue. It's really easy to avoid fights if you don't rush it so you pretty much won't get molested on the way to the fountain, and running away from fights teleports you to the nearest fountain anyway!\nIt's really dumb and doesn't add anything to the gameplay, other than an annoyance to have to backtrack. Plus, when you enter a new area, your first priority is to find either Shady or a fountain, as any area entered for the first time spawns a map for purchase from Shady. So if you find Shady, buy the map and you'll see where the fountain is. If you find the fountain first, remember where it is.\n\nOverall, Costume Quest 2 is fantastic. Fans of the original will adore this game, and like Costume Quest before it, I can see myself giving this game multiple playthroughs.

I tried to walk through it, and there IS no leaving the room! That's pretty much the end of hte game. THere is no escape route. If someone knows Im wrong, please, tell me how to get the h*** out of the room... I would LOVE to know!\n\nSo, 2/5 for this game. Too many bugs, collision avoidance is crap, and the # of enemies is just ridiculous, due to the fact that they are easily avoided.\n\nOk, now for the actual review:\n\nCostume Quest 2 was, to be the nicets possible, ok. I mean, it was never really my kind of game to begin with. HOWEVER, it did leave an impression.\n\nI suggest playing the first game AFTER you play the second game. Playing the first game before this one kind of ruins the second game, because Costume Quest 2 doesn't even have a PRAYER to live up to #1.\n\nThe enemies are bull. They really are. The further you get into the game, the easier it becomes to avoid them, and the more you start to realize the boss fights are the only real battles you need to be concerned about.\n\nThere wasn't enough to it. The game didn't have enough to keep me enteratined, and it became over-repetitive REALLY fast. The fact that they implemented their exploration abiltiies in such unique ways (like the squeaky horn getting them the money to get the boat "fixed") made the exploration abilities INTERESTING, but it seemed just too easy to get the costumes with said abilities. I wasn't even TRYING to get the Hot Dog costume: it just sort of happened.\n\nI hope they don't make a 3rd. Let me just put that out on the table. The first game (sounds) awesome, the second game was more of a drag than the 1st... they would TOTALLY butcher the third. $500 says so.\n\nAnyway, this game isn't recomended. It wasn't good enough to appeal to ME, and my expectations are LOW. Use your $10 to buy something worthwhile: you'd be better spent bying the first one for hecks sake.

If you liked the 1st CQ, you'll like this one.\n\n***Below is my review of CQ1. It holds true to CQ2 as well. There are very few changes other then the story.***\n\nThis game is all about the charm. The story isn't the same ol' derivative RPG story. The characters & setting are very enjoyable. I especially enjoyed playing this during Halloween, It put me in the holiday spirit.\n\nAs an RPG there's nothing truely ground breaking here. The combat is ok, It's a class based system. Classes are selected through a series of costumes. Some costumes have healing abilities, some are damage/crowd control & others are defensive. It may sound unique & interesting, but the battles generally all go the same way due to the fact that your abilities are not able to be activated till the 3rd round. Damage for 3 rounds, if the enemy is still up, stun heal & damage battle over.\n\nI'm a fan of Tim Schafer's work, but I'm going to rate his work on it's own merits.

Barring some changes to combat, it looks and plays pretty much the same as the first game but this time around at a much smoother 60 fps rather than 30.  And it has an interesting story to boot.\n\nThe combat system received a few changes since the first game.  At first glance it seems simplified with all combat moves using the same timed button press for an improved attack.  As you progress through the game you gain more abilities which add new elements to combat and help prevent it becoming dull.  Like any turn-based combat system though it does get repetitive.\n\nBasically, if you enjoyed Costume Quest, you should enjoy this one too.

This, alone, makes it worth the buy, though maybe when it is on sale, if you can wait.\n\nAs for the execution of the game, it's visually stunning compared to the first Costume Quest, otherwise, it is very similar. There are many new worlds and costumes which are fantastic additions to the Costume Quest universe, but the battle system hasn't been changed so much as to be mind blowingly new.\n\n[Begin battle system dissection] Having that said, like some, I also hardly ever used the new Creepy Treat system (unless I was grinding for candy, even then, I only used the candy boosts) because it is not that relevant to the outcome of the battle. In fact, you essentially waste a turn using them. [/end]\n\nIt is possible though not entirely necessary to grind for candy in this version, which can be...painful. Having Candy Corn battle will make or break the grind sessions. Near the end of the game, you get around 200 pieces of candy per battle (more the higher your level), but the cost of things is so high that it is still classified as grinding.\n\nThere are still some mild bugs, such as cutscene transition speed-ups and quests occasionally breaking if you do not complete them in the right order, but it auto-saves so often that it is not a deal breaker.\n\n[Begin ending dissection]They went for an early Disney-esque ending where everybody is happy, but not everyone in the prequel side of the story was given complete closure. Nevertheless, the ending was vastly more concrete than the first Costume Quest, though it does leave a little wiggle room for something small, like DLC.[/end]","October 12, 2014","true","17.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

This year is no exception, and the first big shot is from Double Fine Productions. They are better known for a nice little title called Psychonauts, as well as some amazing smaller titles like Stacking and Broken Age.\n\nCostume Quest 2 is obviously the sequel to Costume Quest from 2010, also in October. At the core it is a turn based RPG with multiple classes and monsters. The first one took about 8 hours to completely, and I'm about 3 hours into this one, and it seems like it going to be much longer! Candy is your currency, and trading cards are your accessories. To change your class, you just don a different costume, each with unique powers and weaknesses. From a clown with a nose horn to a Pterodactyl that blows away leaves. To the very amazing candy corn costume from the first game, that we never got to use. Now we get to, and to make up for it there is an achievement for using it in every battle of the game. I already failed that achievement this time around, because oh ya it is the tank of the game, it has no offense, cant use items, or anything. It just has a fairly high threat, and decent amount of defense.\n\nThe premise of the series is to go door to door trick or treating, fighting monsters, and collecting candy. You use the candy to buy upgrades to your costumes, trading cards, and maps of areas. 11 new costumes and 4 classic costumes (pre-order bonus) make up your classes, ranging from offensive, defensive (seriously the candy corn doesnt do anything but soak damage!), and healers. As an added bonus, the roller skates from the robot costume of the original are permanent, and useable in any costume. Trading cards are now items, slightly replacing stamps. You can put 3 cards into your inventory, and then use them in battle. There is a wide range of options including double exp for the battle, heal to full at the end of the battle, when the enemy attacks they take damage from it as well, a character can go twice per turn, and many more. Maps, seriously they added maps. If you watch my stream of the first game, you can see in the expansion, I missed one house, and could not for the life of me figure out where it was. Probably spent 20 mins looking for it. The map now shows you all the houses that can be trick or treated, as well as healing wells, portals, the number of costume parts found/available, and secrets found/available. Quite a huge addition in my mind.\n\nCombat has had a few tweaks as well. Each character is assigned a button specific to them. It factors in on offensive and defensive sides of the battle. You now can combo a second hit, if timing on your first hit is decent. There are also two tiers of timed hits Nice and AWESOME, both give a bonus to the damage taken, and then roll over to a second hit, which also has a timing action. Defensive uses the same button for the character, and majorly cut down on the damage, just like the original. A big difference from the first is the special meter. Instead of just powering up for 2 turns and being available on the 3rd, it charges up with each attack you give and receive. So now instead of just rotating heals on boss fights, you have to actually think about when the best time to use them is. Each costume as has a strength and weakness associated with it. These correspond to the types of enemies, and give you a bonus or penalty to your attacks if they match up with the enemies type.\n\nThis time around the story picks right up after the ending to the Grubbins on Ice expansion. After jumping into the portal to escape the Monster's home world, you go back to your home town. But things are different, apparently your parents moved next door for some unexplained reason (my theory is a different dimension, not developer error). You then see Oral White DDS and some dude with a clock on his neck jump into a portal and then reappear from it. Your candy bags from Halloween soon disappear and a strangely familiar face jumps out of yet another portal and asks you to jump in with him. For some inexplicable reason, you jump in. Turns out it is Everette, the Knight from the first game, who has grown up and married Lucy (like we didnt see that coming!). The future is crazy, Halloween, costumes, and candy are outlawed, monsters run the place, and all the houses have banners promoting tooth related things as if they were the local sports team.\n\nAll in all the game has improved in many areas, still has the inside jokes, and political statements of the first. Was completely worth the $15 it costs on steam (or $20 if you want the original as well). Anyone who is a fan of the first, stacking, or DFP in general should give this game a serious look. If you want to see how the game plays, I have already streamed quite a bit of the game on the gamesource twitch and youtube channels, so take a look at them! The score that everyone wants to see is that the game is an 8.5 out of 10. The game is 'fun' but not great, and I'd rather have fun than great and boring. The timing on the attacks is a little annoying at times, and I've already encountered a few glitches (non game breaking, just graphical annoyance, and some candy you cant reach at times).","October 11, 2014","true","14.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

You will not feel bored.\n\nIf you get tired of the game playing now, I recommend that you play this.","October 10, 2014","true","8.5"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

Time to give my impressions.\n\nSo, would I still reccomend this game?  Yes.  And here's why.\n\nAs I have mentioned before, the combat is been reworked a little, so instead of function selections it's actually QTE button attacks.  But there is a bit more variety than I first mentioned.  Not a whole lot, you can double attack and counter (if you can time the counter right).  But it still makes a faster pace to battles.\n\nThe Battle Cards replace the Battle Stamps and Creepy Cards, you use the card like items in battle, which takes up one turn.  You can have up to three for selection at battle, and they take a number of battles to recharge (you can cheat this by restarting the game).  The cards vary from "Enemy takes his own damage", to "Double Candy from Battle", to "Get healed 25 percent of your health for three turns" etc.  You get these cards by drops, buying, chests, and trades.\n\nAs I said before, the area's are expanded out quite a bit, but there is only two hub worlds you can play in.  But that's not bad though, there are big maps, and one would take up nearly 3 area's.  Exploration are well done, but near the end the game curves paths to more straight lines so it's easy to get to chests, kids, or quest items.\n\nSpeaking of quests, not too much to offer.  If you played the first one, you'll know what to do in the second one.  If you haven't, it's mostly talk to this person, use this costume to find clues or get to new area's, play hide n seek.\n\nStory is alright.  It's nothing to write home about, but it doesn't have to be.  It made me chuckle and that's what I expected.\n\nAnd that's what I think of this game really, it's expected.  I'm rather glad most YT'ers are sorta overlooking this game, they probably would have chewed it up by the changes since the first one was very charming, and thus it will give them time to look at it for what it is and not what they want it to be.\n\nIf your still on the fence, I would recommend a sale then, at least 30 percent off.  But as it being of Double Fine's first sequel ever?  I think it's alot better than I would have first though.  Give it a shot.","October 7, 2014","true","7.8"," 13 of 32 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","13","32","0","0"

Overall I enjoyed 2 on it's own merits, but I feel it is a lesser outing than the first. The change in both the battle system and the cards was unwelcome. I'd much rather have passive abilities i can choose and stick with than having to constantly juggle the 8-9 useful cards constantly. Real pain when you forget that a good card is off cooldown.\n\nThe super secret is kinda neat and you'll feel pretty awesome if you figure it out yourself.\n\nThe overall story was short (I did 1 playthrough, and got everything in that one playthrough and did it in 9 hours) but was well written and funny.\n\nI'd have to say try it but don't go into it thinking it would be like the first. It's not. Worthwhile on it's own but lacklustre compared to the original.\n\nAlso thinking a sequel might help a bit, least for lengthening playtime, more achievements and maybe fixing the battle system?

If you want to know about that one, I suggest you go read my review on it as a lot is similar.\n\nJust like the first game, this is a wonderfully quirky game with so many jokes that I was frequently laughing out loud. In particular, the Candy Corn costume always made me giggle, despite reading the joke 50+ times. There was less meta-humour in this one than the first, but it was never boring.\n\nThe combat is very similar to the first, but improved overall. There is now only a single form of attack (compared to various QTE-styles in the first game), but they've added additional mechanics like countering that add another dimension to combat. They also added 'actor types' which are a basic form of strengths and weaknesses split between 3 classes; it sounds odd, but it's easy to understand and it adds a tactical edge.\n\nLike with CQ1, however, I did tend to stick to the first costume you get and swap out the third as I went (the second was always Candy Corn for the achievement), but as the visuals are interesting and the cutscene moves are now skippable, that isn't too big an issue.\n\nOne issue I should mention is this game was very easy. I only failed perhaps two fights (and one was because of a glitch), but I did do some grinding in places for XP and candy (in-game currency). The boss fights were very straight forward and fit SO MUCH better into the flow of the game compared to the almost puzzle-like ones in CQ1.\n\nThe story is clever and moves on from the first with just enough nods and references to 1 to induce nostalgia. They would, however, go over the heads of anyone who hasn't played 1, so definitely play that before this. It is a sequel in every sense.\n\nThis was a fantastic game that kept all the good feelings I had for 1 and added to them, creating its own individual experience that fits beautifully into the Costume Quest universe.\n\nWell worth your time, money and laughter.","October 31, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It'll make every battle drag on and get boring or frustrating, and you don't get any in-game bonuses for unlocking the achievement.  It's just a pointless, throwaway achievement added by people on the dev team who had no thought for the consequences this achievement would have on the game (makes the game worse if you try to unlock it).\n\nJust play normally and you'll have a great time.  Granted, it's not as good as the first game.  They took out a lot of customization by removing stamps and made combat even simpler than before.  Still a solid game, but not as good as the first.\n\nJust don't waste your time with the Hardcorn Mode achievement. I cannot stress that enough.

If you want to know about that one, I suggest you go read my review on it as a lot is similar.\n\nJust like the first game, this is a wonderfully quirky game with so many jokes that I was frequently laughing out loud. In particular, the Candy Corn costume always made me giggle, despite reading the joke 50+ times. There was less meta-humour in this one than the first, but it was never boring.\n\nThe combat is very similar to the first, but improved overall. There is now only a single form of attack (compared to various QTE-styles in the first game), but they've added additional mechanics like countering that add another dimension to combat. They also added 'actor types' which are a basic form of strengths and weaknesses split between 3 classes; it sounds odd, but it's easy to understand and it adds a tactical edge.\n\nLike with CQ1, however, I did tend to stick to the first costume you get and swap out the third as I went (the second was always Candy Corn for the achievement), but as the visuals are interesting and the cutscene moves are now skippable, that isn't too big an issue.\n\nOne issue I should mention is this game was very easy. I only failed perhaps two fights (and one was because of a glitch), but I did do some grinding in places for XP and candy (in-game currency). The boss fights were very straight forward and fit SO MUCH better into the flow of the game compared to the almost puzzle-like ones in CQ1.\n\nThe story is clever and moves on from the first with just enough nods and references to 1 to induce nostalgia. They would, however, go over the heads of anyone who hasn't played 1, so definitely play that before this. It is a sequel in every sense.\n\nThis was a fantastic game that kept all the good feelings I had for 1 and added to them, creating its own individual experience that fits beautifully into the Costume Quest universe.\n\nWell worth your time, money and laughter.","October 31, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seeing the characters from past to future was clever.\n5. The new and old enemy designs are cool.\n6. The new costumes were innovative and well thought out.\n7. Using Creepy Treat Cards for a benefit in battle was a good change of pace.\n8. Certain enemies are stronger or weaker to different costumes.\n\nThe Wrong\n\n1. The change in battle style was unnecessary and was many times just difficult to use.\n2. The ending basically ret·cons everything you do. Making what happened in the first one not even matter.\n3. Only 3 of the Creepy treat cards are useful from my point of view.\n\nWhat they should have done.\n\nIf they changed the fight style the way it is with certain enemies being stronger or weaker to certain types of costumes. Then to balance it with the annoying combat style they should have made it to where you use a turn in the middle of battle to swap your costume. Similar to switching a party member in certain RPGs.\n\nStill this game took me about 9 hours to complete, it's not that expensive. Granted mine was a gift, and it's fun enough to replay.

Really weird.\n* Bad keyboard choices for PC. Holding WASD direction keys in tandem with 'Q' (required for certain portions of the game) results in stuck keyboard errors on most PS2 keyboards. Not to mention it gets a bit cramped getting your hands in there like that.\n* Mouse support is bizarre, and terrible. You can either use mouse or keyboard on the menus, but using mouse, for example, on the creepy cards menu results in weird glitchy selection.\n* Inconsistent keyboard use. Depending on the menu/area of game you're in, 'returning' can either be 'esc', 'q', or space. There is no way around this. Also, regardless of how you've set up your keys, the arrow buttons will be used for certain menu actions.\n\n\nAnd the bad:\n\n* respawning. Monsters respawn when you leave a level/game, meaning you can basically grind for candy, making getting 'all the stuff' not strategic, but basically boring. Certain candy-hit items like letterboxes etc also respawn their candy. This took away from  the game in a big way, including leaving the player without a feeling of progression.\n* no difficulty selection - the game presents little challenge - which is a shame due to the amount of mechanics thrown into the combat\n* ridiculously easy end boss\n\n\nTo fix this game they would need to tweak their PC version a little more, throw in a difficulty selection at the start of a game, and basically get rid of the respawning monsters. Then it might actually be worth getting that really cool Creepy card, just to win that final battle.\n\nStill, fun.","June 29, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The costume roulette wheel is back and some costumes also have secondary ‘exploration’ abilities for getting through certain puzzles or shortcuts.\n\nHaving a more cohesive storyline really helped CQ2 appeal to me much more than its prequel and I felt like the comedic relief wasn’t as forced as before either. Little gags like the useless candy corn costume and items or attacks that sound like traditional RPG fare with a silly twist were a nice touch too.

Both this game and the first were good in my opinion, but I would recomend the first more than the second. Standard RPG style and I'm not sure why people are complaining about the graphics and small quirks, at least they fixed the bug where you couldn't clip through your team mates and get stuck at the end of the game. I only found one bug in the game and overall I would say that's pretty good. Takes about 5 hours to complete and 7 to get all the little hidden secrets. Add an extra 10 min to get some achievements and you're golden. 9/10, perfect for your run of the mill casual.","January 17","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
