I absolutely recommend it, it shows the everyday routine of an employee at Valve, some very enlightening points of view on their known delays and some videos plus slideshows too keep you interested while reading. If you read it all calmly and with some attention it will take you a bit less than an hour to go through it all, but I assure you, it's absolutely worth it.","December 27, 2013","true","3.8"," 69 of 75 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","69","75","3","0"

It covers how Portal was created, the complex gestation of the sequel, and the personalities involved at every step.\nThe book is interesting, revealing a lot of behind the scenes info. You learn what a complicated business creating a computer game is, especially a Valve one, and something of the stresses involved. For even at a company like Valve, creating a game is hard work, and it takes its toll. The book makes what use of its computer nature as it can, embedding videos and interactive content. They do not add that much overall though - the pictures and words are what matter.","April 27, 2014","true","5.2"," 56 of 63 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","56","63","2","0"

I highly suggest you buy this if you're a portal fan, cause you will love this book.\n\nThe only thing I dislike, is the awful scrolling, between slides. Doesn't really work.\n\nOverall this is a must own for all Portal 2 fans.\n\nFinal Rating:\n8/10 - Worth reading\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n","April 22","true","0.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","1"

I only picked this up because I'm a huge Portal fan and if there is anything Portal related on Steam, I want it!\n\nThe Final Hours of Portal 2 is an interesting read to say the least. This interactive story on the full ins and outs of Portal 2 was fantastic. It looks at what came before Portal 2, and the aftermath of the game being released to the public. There's plenty of exclusive material such as concept art and original sketches. Along with some interactive animation which was fun! You really won't enjoy this is you aren't a big Portal fan though, so just make sure you've played the original Portal games before giving this digital book a read.\n\nIf you don't like reading, don't worry, it's not a novel, it's a very small read.

Portal 2 is one of the most visually beautiful games I have ever played. It tanks up there with Metroid Prime in terms of level design and ambiance. To have an interactive book show the design and art of the game is simply incredible. It shows how every step of the way Valve was cautious about nailing why this game deserved to be made and ensuring it wasn't completed till it has its modus operandi. I'll probably end up reading it a second time in the near future.

I read a little bit of it earlier but I really read a lot yesterday (I was on a plane, hence the low playtime,) and even finished it. Portal 2 - The Final Hours covers the development, release and post release of Portal 2 inside of Valve. If you like betas, like the Half-Life 2 beta, this is for you. I also reccomend checking out The Final Hours of Half-Life 2. Look it up online and there is a free version.\n\nWhat makes this so different, though? For starters, it includes interactive content. The second picture (Destroy Aperture) is my favourite, as you can use the mouse to destroy some areas in Aperture Laboratories! There is also music that you can listen to, like the songs that inspired the soundtrack of Portal 2, and lots of pictures. There are chapters and polls even.\n\nI really like Valve games and betas, and I thought "WHY NOT?" when I bought this. This is worth $2, even $5 or $10. The writing is great, the interactivity is great, there are interviews, videos, music, polls and pretty much everything that you could hope for in an e-book about Portal 2.\n\nBuy it now.","January 3, 2015","true","25.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","14","15","4","0"

There is a 'Buy Portal 2' button constantly present on all pages, right next to the permanently visible link to the author's website. One page early on in this document has as many as 7 'Buy on iTunes' icons, as well as the text 'Song previews provided courtesy of iTunes'. After the splash screen, four pages of marketing material for the author, Portal 2 and Valve follows, only then to land on the document contents screen. Sometimes you'll come across videos that are available in the document, but then there are also YouTube links to Valve and Portal related videos. And guess what? not all of them are available anymore - they're set to private viewing only.\n\nAlthough it's mildly interesting to read about the varied backgrounds of some of the creators, and to get a glimpse at internal Valve projects, there is really nothing you can get out of this thing that you can't get out of the Portal's and Portal 2's excellent commentary modes.

But I actually really liked the book (despite how brief it was); I think it's a great insight into all the work and everyone who made this game, and this is the only way you can get that kind of exclusivity. It's kind of awesome. And it's only a buck, come on, that's worth it for me (it's 50% off in the Summer Sale). It might even be better than Future Press's Collector's Edition Guide/Artbook (which is also great and I fully recommend it), but that's a stretch.\nAnyways, TL;DR: if you like Portal 2 as much as me and like to read, go for it.","July 17, 2013","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Since 1998, Valve has continuously been the bleeding-edge body of gaming technology--not EA, not Activision, not Ubisoft, but Valve.\n\nThis interactive e-book offers a hands-on multimedia experience into what really happens during game development. Being an engineer myself, I know that Murphy's Law prevails--anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. Even the leader of gaming technology cannot break this law. Yet the ability to start from scratch after stepping back and saying "this product sucks" is such a rarity to see in this day and age. This story offers a rare glimpse at the talent, the culture, and the decisions behind a multi-award winning product.","May 19, 2012","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When reading this I came to understand that there is alot to do when making a game. This book really was alot of fun to read and interact with. It has video clips that add more information to the game and to how Valve operates as a whole.This book will show you concept artwork along with production of the game.This book has music stages of the game and how that process came about.Its a creative way to read a book, that keeps you going if you have a interest in stuff like this.The overall book is well done but doesn't take along time to read through the whole thing.

If you are looking for a game, you'll be horrendously disappointed.

Plain and simple.\n\nSo If you want a really cool behind the scenes pass to the creative environs of Valve HQ, as well as insights from the various contributors towards the conception and execution of a world-class game title, well, you have come to the right place. This book is quite informative and really enjoyable to flip through, despite being a generally light look, as opposed to deep overview.

I only got this because I was a little interested in the development. I didn’t realize how absolutely boring of a read this was going to be. It’s like if Portal came up to you and told you its life story without telling you how it was actually developed. I think to sum up what I’m talking about, it reads something like “Time to get up and go to our exciting job of developing. We were really excited about this one part of the game when it came together. It was an exciting experience developing this game.” I’d rather be reading all of the court logs from when the Titanic sank for amusement than read about someone’s thoughts on the development of this and not tell us how it was actually developed. Maybe I just skimmed over it too much, but this is all I got from looking at the thing.\n\nI don’t recommend getting it at all.","March 28, 2015","false","1.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","0"

Nor is it DLC or a mod or anything like that.\n\nIt is a sort of book.\n\nRemember those things, Oh esteemed Review Reader? Those things with pages and words?\n\nWell, this is kind of like that. Except that it's digital. But that doesn't mean it's a boring sort of ebook like your mother has on her Kindle.\n\nIt has all sorts of web content built in, like youtube clips and photo galleries and so on. It also has all sorts of other interactive bits, where, for example, you can compare the Aperture of Portal 1 to that of Portal 2, and pretty much any picture you see can be viewed in high-def.\n\nYou might imagine this is just some sort of book with bits of the internet pasted in at random intervals, but you'd be wrong. Not only are the pages and elements really well laid out (with the sort of quality and style you might expect from a big coffee-table book), but they are all really well integrated with the text. The author is talking about an early pre-beta concept for multiplayer? Then there's an embedded video with footage. Now he's interviewing the composer of "Want you gone"? There are various work-in-progress versions of the song that you can play from within the book.\n\nAs for content, it's also great. The author was basically granted access to the studios for the duration of the making of Portal 2, and goes into great detail about the process of making the game. There's also some human interest, as it talks about the backgrounds of the various team members and subsiduary teams, how they got into the video game business and what they brought to the team. It covers all aspects of the game, from how the story was developed, the artwork, animation, music and even marketing.\n\nIt's also pretty decent value for money. I picked it up on sale for about 30p (~50c), and I think it is usually about £1.50 (~$2.00) which is not bad for about 2hrs reading.\n\nThe only con I'd have to mention is the lack of multi-platform support. I thought it was awesome that I could play Portal 1 and 2 on Linux without having to boot back into Windows, so it's a bit of a shame that they couldn't make this multimedia ebook thing cross platform.\n\nBut other than that, a fascinating read; reccommended for all Portal fans, and even for those interested in game design in general.","May 31, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
