With the number of games released it is no wonder sometimes really good games slip between the cracks and fail to get the attention they deserve.\nIt has tons of atmosphere in a snowy landscape where a bunch of people under your avatars leadership is struggling to survive a lawless environment filled with animals, bandits , slave traders and nature itself.\nAs you lead your group of people  you have to maintain a relationship with each, hear their stories and make decisions all the time on what to do or where to go. The plot has you trying to free some friends from slave traders and in your quest you have to constantly take care of the needs of your group  by hunting, scavenging, trading and talking to people.\nThe controls are flawless, (you can just point and click on the map to tell the group where to go and while moving you have to keep an eye out for sites to hunt or scavenge. Sometimes you have to fight and this means making choices on how to approach the fight in several stages and the fight resolves itself.\nThe drawings and the artwork is first class , the storytelling engaging and the gameplay varied enough to keep you going.  The music is atmospheric as it should be.\nSo, once again I am seriously amazed at this game not making a bigger splash than it did so far. For the price they ask it's guaranteed to make you very happy you bought this game.  9/10","November 20, 2015","true","6.3"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","43","48","0","1"

I refunded the game and so no longer have it. I've understood the devs have updated since then but I cannot comment on any changes they've made.\n\nToo many bugs at the moment. If you and a team member receive damage it simply says 'You and  recieved damage'. Certain events don't match up to where you are. I was in an abandoned police station and got a 'Quick! One of your parties members is falling off a cliff'. You also can't tell who is talking as you see the names once and the rest of the time it's just a picture of the person, whom you've completely forgotten which name it is. Played it for about 30 minutes before it got annoying. Also, when you loot something, you can't hover over it to see what it actually is before you take it, most things like this, which are intuitive to video games is missing.","July 27, 2015","false","0.5"," 158 of 259 people (61%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","61","158","259","15","12"

It is primarily a text based adventure with artwork to add the visual experience. Indeed it reminds me of a modernized old school MUD. There is a lot of text in the game and it’s something that must be read to really get invested in the characters and story which is really what the game is all about. ICY focuses heavily on choices, each choice you make will have a consequence and some will even effect the games ending as there are multiple endings to experience.\n\nThe game does have quite a few bugs in its current state. Occasionally situations mismatch such as a party member falling off a cliff in a 1 story building. The UI can be unresponsive and there is not hover mouse system for the inventory so you actually have to click on something to find out what it is. The whole game is clearly designed for a mobile port and it lacks the cohesion it needs in terms of the UI for a mouse a keyboard.\n\nIf you like narratively driven games and don’t mind reading a lot of text then I can imagine you would enjoy Icy however other than that I would suggest avoiding it as I can see where people would get very frustrated at a lot of its core design. It’s7 not a bad little indie game by any means but it sure has its problems and I feel that a good amount of voice acting would have gone a long way to massively improving the narrative.\n","July 27, 2015","true","5.7"," 48 of 71 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","48","71","4","0"

The hand drawn art style is very well executed and the narrative is excellent. If you enjoy text based games, there's a lot of fun to be had here.\n\nThe RPG-esque character building system the game opens with is interesting, allowing you to allocate points into conversation based skills, or exploration and combat skills (to turn the game's RNG in your favour). I would like to see stronger influences in-game from how you allocate your stats however, as the difficulty on Story Mode made this seem slightly inconsequential. I went with a purely social build and din't have many issues with combat, especially since it's easy to balance out relatively quickly.\n\nAlthough fun to play, the number of random events and outcomes need to be greatly expanded upon. A lot of looting events are constantly repeated and have mismatched outcomes (characters randomly falling off cliffs when looting a building, etc). You can also spoil the story if you decide to explore areas that you aren't being guided to by the quest system.\n\nThere's an interesting selection of loot in the game, but sadly you can only equip the player character and not your entire group. I'd appreciate being able to equip my spare weapons onto other party members, since it's unclear if they even effect your combat stats.\n\nDialogue wise, it would be nice to see some of the weird translations and syntax patched into more colloquial English. The story is excellent and poor translation can spoil the immersion.\n\nEven though I'm being critical, I really enjoy the game overall and think a patch or two could make something good truly outstanding. Hopefully we see a few updates soon! I think some community involvement with the Devs would do a world of good.","July 27, 2015","true","4.2"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","29","40","0","0"

I'll edit when/if things change or become necessary\n\nThe Good:\nThe story and main characters seem decently written, with a nice amount of comedic relief mixing in with the generally tense, bleak atmosphere.\nHas somewhat of a "point and click" feel to the loot, it makes you want to keep things with you in hopes of using it for events.\nThe events that happen seem plausible in the environment, and the RNG behind them doesn't seem overly punishing.\nNeeding to keep track of multiple resources (food, first aid, fuel) adds a bit of complexity to the game.\n\nThe Meh:\nFirst and foremost, grammatical errors are rife in this game. You'll still get the point, but can't help but wince at some of the mispelled words and errors. (To vs too, for example)\nSometimes the dialogue choices don't seem to match up to what you find in your inventory.\nI've had some of the plot revealed through dialogue choices I could see, despite not pressing characters about their backstory. (You were a red horseman? Gee, you didn't mention that when we talked Fang)\nNo loot after battles? Huh?\nThe game definitely has some glitches with inventory, both the player's and items the npcs sell.\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of dialogue driven games, it's still worth a look. It just would've been nice to see a bit more attention given to the dialogue, I suppose the errors could be confined to the first part of the game, but not holding my breath. I've enjoyed the game so far and will edit later to add a link to a let's play series I'm doing of the game if you want to see some gameplay footage.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm32MDNux20 and voila', the link appears.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/375400/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","This game reminds me of one of those well made CYoA style games on mobile (like Tales of Illyria - probably one of the best story mixed with turn based combat games Ive ever seen on mobile), also a simpler NeoScavenger. The premise is interesting, it appears to be a nuclear winter post apocalyptic wasteland, far enough in the future where our society referred to as the "ancients" and only remnants survive. Groups of nomads who call themselves "families" eke out a living in the frozen waste, and bandits and slavers run about harrassing people\n\nIts pretty simple. You create your character. Put points in stats and off you go. The story is told through images and text.  You choose what to say from a few options, which changes the outcome. Typical dialogue tree stuff any gamer is familiar with.\n\nTheres a map you wander around on, showing a little party icon. You have medicine to heal, food and fuel (basically anything to burn, although the image is a gas can). You need food to not starve as you wander about. Time passes as shown by the little clock in the corner, and at night ou need fuel or the party may take damage if you cant find a safe place to rest. Bullets are used in guns, and also as currency.\n\nYou can hunt, or scavenge certain areas. Hunting and scavenging are handled through a random event "choose what you do" type thing (ex. you come across a locked storage shed - do you try and pick the lock, use explosives (if you have them), have a party member break in etc). The choices you make determines any further random events or what you get for your feffortTheres a basic inventory and equipment, but you seem to be only allowed to equip your charactere, not your party. You can also collect items to barter in trade areas.\n\nCombat is handled through a similar system, only there is "party health" and "party morale" bars, and the enemy party has one of each too. Random combat syle events are mixed in where you have to use your skills.\n\nInteresting random events happen, and can lead to people dying, getting angry, or joining your group. The story and premise are interesting. I'm a sucker for post apocalyptic games, especially ones like this where the writing's pretty good and the story is different enough from standard post apocalyptic fare to make it interesting. The map seems large, although I dont have enough in game hours to see how long the game really is.\n\nMy one complaint is that it throws you right into it without even a brief tutorial of game functions. The UI took me a bit to figure out, and the help menu doesnt really help at all. Like can you equip stuff on other party members? Do they use your items that are in inventory? Is there crafting, or is it ok to just sell off the animal fur and random elertrical parts Ive collected for fuel and other goods? I still don't know. I'm all for not handholding, but at least tell us how to operate the UI! Another thing. Theres a setting, I think is "difficulty". It goes "Story, Easy, Normal, Hard, Survivor". It was autoset to "Story". So does that mean the others are not a story mode, but a survive-as-long-as-you-can-mode? I have no idea. If it is just the difficulty, why on earth does it default to the easiest mode? Shouldnt it be "normal?" And why is it called "story" and not "easiest"? Theres some minor graphical bugs too. I got one where inventory items owuld get all stacked up on top of each other when you switched between item types. Nothing major, though so far.\n\nThe price of the game seems a bit steep at $13. Unless the game is *huge* and the main quest is long with lots of sidequests. I dont know yet. I got it for 40% off and Im happy with the price I paid\n\nIts still fun though. Fans of NeoScavenger type games wil like this one.","October 29, 2015","true","2.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","2"

Leading a band of nomads across a frozen waste, you will constantly be faced with hard decisions. From choosing where you lead your family, what quests you take and even who lives and who dies. Icy can best be explained as a choose your own adventure style game. The gameplay itself is rather simplistic in nature with good art backgrounds and portraits, and plenty of written narrative. If you're not a fan of reading, might wanna pass. One of the highlights of Icy is it's replay, while the beginning usually starts the same, once you reach the open world you are given plenty of paths that are affected by your skills. Perhaps you choose to master stealth or be a deadly bowman. All of these will change the outcome of events and shape the story. In all if you're a fan of games like Richard & Alice, The Banner Saga, Icy has something to offer you with it's very mature story and deadly consequences themed gameplay.

Trust me it had lots of bugs, not even a save system. And from the 2+ hours i played on this Steam version, it showed me that the developers do care (at least somewhat) about their game. Making improvements from save system and crashing issues to graphical changes and new characters or dialogue. And along with performace, the amazing artist has made more portraits and scenary, all of them extremely beautiful.\n\nThe story and RPG aspect is interesting, at least mostly enveloping and imersing you into the world you must now survive in. It gives plenty of atmosphere, a decent soundtrack, plenty of characters in your party with their own distinct personality and simple backstories, along with items and skills that will affect your combat and/or survivabilty. The choices of dialogue are easily understandable and rather straight forward, so no real problems there. Traveling around the wasteland is incredibly easy: easy to know where objectives are, where your parties is, what every object on the map is.\n\nBut thats about it for the game.\n\nPerformance is terrible, often taking a long time loading MORE PIECES OF TEXT. And thats coming from a computer with a 4.2GHZ processor. I can't see whats so hard about loading text or still images. Options are limited or bugged as well, not being able to turn down the Sound Effects so I may hear the quiet Music is a real pain in the butt seeing as to that should be expected from any game, as too online flash games have volume control. Even the option to turn the graphics from Fastest to Beautiful isn't saved after you quit the game. What graphics are even turned down? The resolution of images? If that is the case, then turning down resolution of a game based on still pictures and text would make the game way less beautiful and imersive. Why is there even graphical options? Its text and still images. And along with performance issues and low Options or features, is the noticible grammer errors, mispellings or, (what i presume to be) mistakes in the pictures, like just some weird details in it. Combat feels rather bare and strange honestly. I feel like I'm slaughtering doezens of Bandits or Raiders thanks to the special event after the main offensive, usually the special event tells of at least one man getting shot and killed or just killed in some other way. And their doesn't feel to be a ranking up in weapons of any sort, due to the fact you may seach a chest and find a rifle when most of your weapons are crude bows.\n\nBut I have ONE main problem with this game: detail.\n\nThis game does not feel like it provides enough detail for me to be completely imersed and excited about the story. Right now, I'm on a quest for revenge for some of the tribesman some mercanaries captured. The problem is I don't really care. I never really knew the people that were captured. All I really knew was that is was a mother and two children. I wasn't able to spend enough time to get to know them, but that's the main objective so far in the game, so I feel unmotivated to go hunting for them. Characters feel vague and shell-like, same about scenary. In other words, I feel like I'm missing that detail to paint the clear picture in my head, from both the landscapes and the dialogue.\n\nHowever, even if all these things make the game look bad, trust me, it is anything but. I personally freaking love this game. It feels like it has a lot of charm and care put into it. Like the developers WANTED to make this game, not just for profit, but for the sake of making this game. It is their first game, so bugs, mistakes, or poor disign are expected. So I will be patiently waitng for updates that I know will happen to fix or improve this game. These developers feel like they have a lot of potential and I can't wait for more adventures, and I will most likely buy them the day they come out just like this game, and I would recommened anyone else to do the same.\n\nAnd if Inner Void is reading this, I was guy who recommened names under portraits, and you said that you were going to do that. Why isn't that there? Like... the fuq? Whatever, love you guys. <3\n\nUPDATE #1:\nAs I dwelved deeper into the game, it seemed more and more obvious that this game has several bugs and... well parts that dont make since. As I exploring, having done nothing too out of the ordinary, a promt for deciding wether to sleep without a fire or to find a safe place showed up. This happened right in the middle of a 90 min game session out of the blue. It's never happened before and it just leaves me with those few options. If you don't find a safe place or you sleep without a fire, you get damaged. I'm guessing sleeping without a fire damages the party less than not finding a safe place. Which is understandable. It makes the game much more of a challenge and is kind of like a constant reminder that you're a survivor in a snowy wasteland. In order to heal, you need medicines, in order to get medicines, you need bullets, in order to get bullets without doing quests, you need to scavange. With multiple options on how to get into a building or into a box or reach up to get onto a roof, to get to a different floor, etc., it feels nice because it leaves it up to you and what resources you want to use. Early in the game, everything works fine, every resource you use always works and you're able to scavange whatever. However, later in, it never seems to work. I should have plenty of skill to scavange without getting hurt, yet no matter what, I still get hurt on everything that shouldn't hurt at all. For example:\n<You have find a large metal box. It's locked shut.>\n"Okay, I'll just lockpick it, should be easy. Right?"\n<You picked the lock>\n<You couldn't open the box>\n*You and (insert name) has taken 16 damage*\n<You find some cigarettes and a teddy bear>\n\nDoesn't make much sense, right? Well now image it happens virtually everytime. Not very fun having to sell what you found just to afford medicines to patch up your people. If I'm doing something wrong, I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. I like the set of options they have for doing these sort of things, 1 for risk without consumtion of resources, 2 for using resources with less risk, and 1 for walking away. Even then, one of the two resources can be way more valuable than the other, it really depends how badly you want to get it. But I hate the fact that I still seem to take enourmous risk even when using resources. I'd rather have it the game provides scarse and valuable rescources than having them everywhere but almost worthless.\n\nAnd also, the random people asking for help by giving them food or something, feels almost empty. Give them some, nothing else happens. Refuse, nothing else happens. I feel like I can refuse without consiquence, and since I get no reward if I give them some other than feeling like a good person, I'll just refuse everytime. Not really a big deal.\n\nTruly, what is keeping the main part of this game together is the beautiful paintings (such as portraits and backgrounds), loveable characters, setting, atmosphere, and the fact that once you start its hard to stop. This game this needs fixes to performace bugs, needs bigger dialogues, mechanic changes and detailing, and supporting from more fans. I would like to see more games for Inner Void, but so far this game doesn't seem popular, which could lead to lower budgets, and their next game not being up to par. Still, I would recommend this to any wanting to kill time, start a new game, find stories fasinating, or anyone into apocolyptic scenarious. I believe it's really worth it.","July 31, 2015","true","3.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","2"

It is story and reading heavy, so you have to be into those things if you're going to like it. There is no action - at least none other than what is told to you through words on the screen.\n\nEssentially you are the leader of a group of survivors in a post apocalyptic world and have to find your way through the world to survive. You have to trade, hunt for food and get through drama within the group as well as make the decisions that ultimately lead your group into success or death.

As of right now, I still do not recommend it. I will continue to update my review as they update their game.\n\nIcy is a survival RPG in a frozen, post-apocalyptic world. You play as the leader of a nomadic tribe who has amnesia and make choices in a barren environment while balancing your needs, the group's needs, and the resources necessary to survive.\n\nI originally backed this game on Indiegogo because it looked interesting and was only $5. Displaying gif's and art to promote the game, it seemed like it had promise. However, when I played the game, it was severely disappointing. The storyline is minimal and the character development is slight as well. I did not feel attached to any character even if they had a traumatic event happen to them. In addition, because the game relies mainly on text to further the storyline, I expected the game to have few errors in the writing. Although, it is just the opposite. In less than an hour, I found several spelling errors and repeats which detract from the overall atmosphere the games wishes to create. In fact, the writing is nothing special as well. It feels like an average high schooler wrote everything as the content was dry.\n\nThe quest in the beginning of the game wasn't very thought-out either. Rather than vary the requests that one receives, the quest-giver asks for the same items repeatedly. This detracts from the storyline as the place doesn't seem to be fully self-sufficient. Also, this makes it seem like a grind-fest to get currency (ammo) in the game and bored me even further.\n\nConsequently, the skill/stat system and battle system are very much so intertwined. When one creates a character, they have the ability to choose between 3 main stats and 10 skills. (I just put points in pretty much everything like a jack-of-all-trades.) These skills typically determine the success of an action. It seemed very flawed because while I perked most of my skill points into less violent means such as sneaking and medicine, I did not feel like they may have helped me at all. There was no success chance or anything, just a simple pass or fail. The battle system had very little variety as well. When fighting a battle, I remember about 4 different scenarios -- most of which have slight variations in terms of choices one is allowed.\n\nLastly, the movement on the map isn't smooth or practical. There are certain landmarks on the map which allow the party to scavenge, hunt, or even proceed with a mission. In order to get to these landmarks, you click and your character will move. While moving, a figurine that represents your party just slides on a 2-D map. Although, there is no such thing as a stop. If you move, you will keep moving to that location even if it was an accident. In order to stop going there, you must click near yourself. This wastes valuable resources and time. In addition, if you do hit a landmark, it isn't very clear whether you actually hit it or not as the hitbox isn't accurate with the model. When doing one of the story quests, I was supposed to go to a church. I hit the edge of the church and nothing happened. I clicked a little closer and nothing happened. I had to go to the direct center before the event automatically played. I wish there was a "Enter" button or something to make it a lot more clear that you can use the landmark.\n\nIn my opinion, the only redeeming quality that I enjoyed was the artwork and some music. I definitely enjoyed the ambiance that it set as they were played well together. The supplementary artwork was superb as it allowed me to imagine the perils the characters currently are having. Although, while these two facets were nice, all of the cons and bugs detracted from it.  All in all, I would not recommend this game -- not even for the $5 that I used to back it on Indiegogo.","July 29, 2015","false","1.8"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","26","41","2","0"

The combat is very basic, you choose what you want to use to fight with in a turn based esc gameplay with scenarios every turn, this varies depending on who and where you are fighting. You will have to hunt and scavenge for food to keep your companions alive as you progress this deep story.\n====================================================================================\nGameplay\n====================================================================================\nThe game is heavily based around story, if you aren't wanting to read and just want to survive then I guess you could just skip through the story parts but the survival isn't fleshed out and is quite lacking, like I said you can hunt and scavenge but aside from that not much else happens except random events. This game is more of a visual novel with gameplay elements than a proper survival game. And for me I am fine with that though I do feel a sandbox mode would have so much potential in this sort of game.\n\nI am currently unaware of any bugs others have reported but that doesn't mean they aren't there, I either just haven't noticed them or they haven't occured.\n====================================================================================\nConclusion\n====================================================================================\nI give the game a 9/10 for being fun, unique and having a very intresting story that is quite hooking and is a must buy for any visual novel fans out there though not for the die hard survival fans.\n\n====================================================================================\nYouTube\n==================================================================================== https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kduvnJadpek","July 28, 2015","true","1.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It's the right color and saturation for the setting, it is bleak, but there is still color with sunrises and sets. Only playing for a short time, there was quite a bit of dialogue. There are quite a few small side stories/dialogues. The combat is slightly repetitive, and there aren't many options. There aren't many tutorials, just the beginning hunting and scavaging. It adds a bit of confusion if you've never played before.\n\nIn the end, I am not the largest fan of the game, but you  should  try it for yourself and return it if you dislike it.\n\nMy first impression video.

It aspires to be an open world rpg that brings Fallout to mind, both in structure and in the post-apocalyptic theme. However, it relies on 2D graphics and lots of text to do the job. As such in all honesty I must say I have mixed feelings. It's a good game, and the survival part is much better implemented than in Fallout as it involves a resource management element, the need to hunt and scavenge to keep your group of survivors alive. Some of the menus are poorly designed, especially the trading menu. With the plethora of games that have used such a feature in the past it surprises me that the developers couldn't do a better job: it's really difficult to navigate. The combat feels more like a gamebook than a videogame, but I like how it makes you feel like you're making important choices. And important choices are an element that is well implemented throughout the entire game. I do feel like recommending this game, if only to support the effort this small team undertook. Just don't expect a masterpiece. I look forward to see more from this indie studio of developers!","January 5","true","2.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

You will meet many people on your journey, and have the opportunity to speak with your followers, and find out a little bit about them and how they think during your travels.

E.g. you have a machine gun stuck with a grenade, you won't be able to drag that out into another empty box.\n\nAlso most importantly SAVE OFTEN. When you run out of food, the game will end it in a very anti-climatic 'You are dead' screen. So if you're heading to Eden, remembering to stock up on food, otherwise when you head out of it, your group will die of lack of food as there won't be hunting area close enough to save you. (E.g. I had 12 food with around 7 heads to feed, died after moving the group out a couple of paces away, had to reload from mid game because that was when I last saved.)\n\nTLDR: If you enjoy choose-your-own-adventure point-n-click games with a post-apocalyptic theme of the winter, this game is ok to buy when there's a discount.","March 7","true","5.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I haven't finished it yet, so take heed. Regardless, what starts off as a boring, but always pretty adventure, becomes a bit like Walking Dead with Snow. You're trying to find out what is everyone's "deal". The intrigues and fights among the group members really remind me of TWD, as you slowly begin to realize, the enemies aren't outside, but also within, which is a nice story arc for these kind of games. The game's best part is that, it always reminds you, this environment is not friendly, and you shouldn't take it lightly. Some dialogs are a bit weird, that i must say, but I can't say i bother paying much attention to them. When the game alternates from it's norm, and playable random events occur, that's when it's most exciting, I hope it delivers, cause so far it seems to be really good.

I reserve that reward for games I find truly exceptional.\n\nICY is a choose your own adventure (think of Goosebump books when you were younger, ala: "Turn to Page 89 for the Right Door, or Page 55 for the Left" and so on). Not exactly like that but thats the jist of it all. What helps ICY stand out from the pack of the, normally, boring "reading games" is not only the fantastic story telling and writing, but also a few things that are lacking from the other games that fit this genre, namely: Gorgeous artwork and bone chilling audio.\n\nLets get down to the nuts and bolts of the game. (I will keep it semi-short and simple). Throughout the game, to keep you on edge, are battles you have to fight where you choose from a couple actions you can take and must deplete enemy morale or health.These battles range from fighting bandits, to bears, to mutant rats. What makes these battles, towns, and forests that make up "the Vale" (the setting of ICY) is the artwork; which is gorgeous. All characters have their own portraits that are lovingly drawn to match how you would image each character would actually look. The game is set on a large black and white (and grey) map with different towns and forests etc to hunt and explore in. On their own, the story and artwork would still make this game a cut above the rest of "choose your own adventure" games, but what truly makes the game feel alive is the sounds and songs of this amazing world. Whether it's the gripping intro/menu music to the smushing of snow crunching under your feet as you traverse the games freezing settings, the music and sound effects were expertly chosen to really make this game special. (The opening menu music is, IMO, an instant classic). I could go on for much longer, but I believe this enough to inspire a few of you to pick this game up. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. For this genre, as far as I have found, it does not get better than ICY.","August 4, 2015","true","12.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It gives you an interesting and new take on the post-apocalyptic setting that I've not seen before, and puts you right into the story right away. Which is good, because that is what this game centers around almost entirely, is it's story. Sure there are some supply management gimmicks, but this game is clearly not about that or the action, it felt more a part of the overall story and settting.

So, scrolling my list of games, i find ICY, bought after its release.\n\nI'm still playing, but i HAD the morale obligation to write this review.\n\nICY is a textual RPG set in a post-apocalyptic world, frozen more than Alaska during winter, but with more wolves and less freedom (Thank you, Obama). It's a cruel world, where the few survivors find themselves fighting for their lives day after day, against beasts, and infection, and lack of resources (food, combustile etc...). You're one of the survivors in this world, and the game start when you and one of the most experience guy of your tribe are hunting a deer. And since the start you can see the core of the game: strong writing, capable of describe the action without boring too much with WoT full of philosophycal thoughts on how we're hunting and not buying a mc Bacon for 3$, DAMN YOU HUMANITY, etc.\nWith the aid of beatiful artwork, ALL the action is put on screen with taste: taste for the story, for the setting, and with respect for the people playing the game.\n\nThe more you play, the more you want to play. All the companions on your party have a story, their ideas, their personality, that, like in all the good story, you're going to discover with your interactions with the world.\n\nFor 12,99 € (it's 6,99€ now with the steam sales), you can have a beatiful, little pearl, that will full around 4-5 hours of your life (i'm pretty sure my run is gonna take more, i love to procrastinate). And, if you are a RPG lover, you will find everything you need here: choices, consequences, skill check. All the package.\nStop playing Bethesda's Fallout.

Then the most predictable thing occurs. Then you come to a ham-handed "racism is bad" event. It's cringeworthy. Also, at one point you're referred to as a he even if you're female. Clearly the devs are MRAs (that's a joke).\n\nAll the while, you're failing at everything. I put a lot of points into speech and charisma stuff. Never got an opportunity for it. But I also put a lot into stealth and bows. Never succeeded once at those in combat. It's a very simple system. In a round, both sides deal damage to each other, based on... something. Then you're presented with one of seeemingly six or so "events" and four semi-random ways to eal with it. By stealth, with a gun, with stabbing, with a bow, whatever. Naturally, I chose what I was best at. No luck.\n\nSo I made a character completely min-maxed for bows and melee. The starting event of hunting a deer still had my arrow miss, suggesting that doesn't change, which is irksome enough. But then I still never succeeded at anything in combat! Clearly this game is terribly balanced. I queestion whether your actions have any effect at all.\n\nYou do succeed at scavenging and boar-hunting, though seemingly regardleess of whether or not you have any points in the respective skills, so they're automatic successes, really. And everything else (so, everything in combat) is an automatic failure, despite how you build your character. The onee success I had just made the railroaded auto-failure combat end even faster for some reason, because oh no, we can't have the player winning.\n\nI also chose different dialogue options where presented and it seemed that it changed only the next line and nothing else. This can, and does, make some bits of dialogue make no damn seense whatsoeever because it doesn't adapt properly to your reesponse, though. So good job there!\n\nAlso, though I care little about the graphics, they're awful, such as they are. It's all menu-driven, which is just less immersive than the alternative, but should be fine. But the travel segments are awful, and your destination ends up looking confusingly misaligned from where you clicked.\n\nOn top of that, the options are awful. No volume sliders. That's really all it needs, but it doesn't have them. And it irks me greatly, that rather than using quotatin marks, they use << and >> to frame dialogue. It's just irksome. Also theere ar emenu and tooltip problems. It doesn't seem to have many tooltips, and you sometimes have to click in very specific places to get things to work.\n\nPerhaps it gets better and the story becomes worth dealing with the annoyances. I won't be finding out. Shame too. A somewhat unique post-apocalypse seemed cool.\n\nThough it should be mentioned the cold seems to have no effect on anything; it's just flavor. I didn't really expect anything else, but still.\n\nI know I focused a lot on mechanical problems, but that's just because "bad writing" is pretty straightforward. And it is by far thee biggest problem here. So I would say this is straight up not worth your time, for any price, based on the first half hour, even if they do fix bugs.","July 27, 2015","false","0.5"," 29 of 54 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","29","54","0","0"

The music keeps thinga unsettling and melancolic. It reminded me of the first Icewind Dale quite a lot.\n- the story mode is not too difficult nor too easy. Still, I'm not a survival fan so I do prefer this kind of RPG mix to the hardcore style other games have. If you are more into survival than RPG you might not like it as I did.\n\nThe devs team seems to be quite serious, even if they are an indie Software Hosue they addressed the issues the first release had in a short time and now Icy seems to run quite smoothly.\nAlso, they released it in august like promised and they always kept us founders well informed during both the campaign and the aftermath.\nAlso, it's not exactly expensive.\n\nI would recommend it without any doubt.\n","September 6, 2015","true","5.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Not much replayability unless you want to go everywhere to scavenge - which doesn't really do much at the moment since all you can do with items is sell them for bullets.\n\n-Levelling system needs an overhaul. There are no prompts for levelling up or gaining xp.\n\n-For a narrative based rpg there's not much story, and for a story based game it's riddled with spelling errors. There's a disclaimer saying English is not the devs native language, but if you're making a story based game it's quite important.\n\n-Actions and decisions don't really have that many consequences and you can redo some sections of text to get a different outcome without even restarting the game or loading from a save.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you're looking for a gritty game about survival and scavenging, get This War of Mine instead.

How the culture has grown and changed and so on. To bad the developer hasnt really done any of those things. To take some good things first. The artwork is well done, and i really like the character portraits. The game hasnt crashed, and dont seem that buggy. Now proceeding aaaall the bad points.\n\nArtwork 8/10\nUI 2.5/10\nStory/bacground 0.5/10\nWriting 0.5/10\n\nAfter this there is some small spoilers.\n\nThe interface is sloppy and tiresome to use. Such as you said the popupp when you hover over an item is missing, and in trader screen you sometimes end up selling/buying stuff you shouldnt. The combat/hunting isnt streamlined at all. Like you are hunting deer and suddenly a wolf attacks you? (and the writing seems to think you where fighting a pack of wolves)\nThe scavenging rarely has any difference which icon you go to so its just a random chance event. and they get reset, so you can go around on the same part of the map getting the same as if you went anywhere else. When you go into a house and find a box. Lets lockpick the box. Well done you open the box, "next" you failed at opening the box, "take 10 damage" then grab the stuff. This happens all the time with all events. Sems like it rolls twice.\n\nThe questgivers only give you one repeateable quest each, and they are'nt even smart enough to make it "kill 15 wolfs", One example is you go to a church to get some religious relic's and end up having to fight some mutants for it" And repeat that quest as many times as you want.\n\nThere is zero npc depth and barely a thin toilet paper crust around the main characters. The only thing thats worth clicking on with npcs is "get a job" or "buy items". If all of them had died horrendous deaths i would at most go "huh". And in the quests you dont really feel like youre interacting when something happens, you might as well be reading a book. Witch you kind of are, since this is an text game. So fun to figure out that the writing is extremely dry, and i know the developers are not from an native english country. But seriously! I had a better sentence structure and grammar on the forums when i was 10 using google translate. And sometimes to top it off, The stuff that stands on the screen sometimes means the oposite of what it says.\n\nThis ♥♥♥♥♥ feels like a school project where you have a person that does the art, which is competent, And the one to figure out the setting satt down and tought for a while, While the people that stood for storytelling, GUI and npc/character/world story decided to freeball it at the presantation, while the writer is sitting on the toilet with massive diarrhea,\n\nAnd why the pineapple cant you hunt for stuff outside the forest, and at the buldings? Makes no sense.\n\nWhen you visit their website you get a lot of 404 errors.","July 30, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

If you like visual novels, look up a Let's Play and see if you'll like this game.\n\nQuick note: I really only talked about the meat of the game, any minor thing is generally ignored to make sure you understand what this game is. Visual novels aren't my style, hence why I'm not reccomending this game. If you like them, consider reading this; if you don't, then you've got your answer to whether or not you should buy this game.\n\nICY is a great example of a visual novel type game with an RPG element. The story gives off a TellTale Walking Dead feel to it. There is a real sense of desperation and you can really feel the atmosphere. I've only played this game a short while, but I got the general story down. The characters are sometimes hard to connect with, it seems like they never feel uncertain. It's black and white with them (a good example of this is about 5 minutes into the game before you sleep for the first time).\n\nThe main plot seems to be centered around getting...somewhere. The biggest problem I have with the game is the backstory to your character, as in, there isn't one. You have amnesia and you're essentially thrown into the middle of a family that, although your character is comfortable with, you have no idea who they are. This does not help when you're trying to get an understanding of how these characters feel. Let me recap really quick, you get no backstory expect that you were found and taken in by some people who became your family. That just isn't helpful!\n\nEven if the backstory seems shallow, it does seem to pickup later on. The only issue with that is by the time it does, you're probably playing something else or already got bored of the game. That's what happened to me atleast.\n\nThe gameplay is alright. Like I said, I got bored of the game so I didn't expierience too much. The gameplay comes down to going into woods/forests and hunting or (I assume) find material. You can also scavange abadoned towns to find any material you need, if you can find it, that is.\n\nCombat is one thing I didn't get into, let me explain. At the start of the game, you're allow to change/choose stats for your character. I put a lot into speechcraft and stealth, only to have the game throw me straight into combat within 15 minutes. Albiet, it's related to the story, but it isn't a good transition to get the story started. It feels a little clunky and cheaped out, and that's about the meat of the game.\n\nThere isn't much more to say. Dialogue choices seem like they don't really matter because it's either the story progresses or it doesn't. There isn't any in-between to that. For what ICY tries to do, it does it well, but not well enough. The transition from RPG to Novel to RPG just doesn't feel right, or I couldn't get into it atleast.\n\nMy final reccomendation for this game is: If you like Indie RPG's and/or visual novels, then check it out. If you don't like either, or just visiual novels in general; then keep moving. I'd highly request a demo for this game just to see if people can see if they'd like to purchase it.\n\nI play the first 20 minutes of the game here. You can watch it to see if the game is for you (There's no demo so I guess this is the second best thing).\nhttps://youtu.be/pk_QEee4d98","August 15, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

It's wooden, stilted and unrealistically vulgar. (I don't mind strong language at all, but the vocabulary used here feels like someone said "let's throw in some bad words at random places to make the characters seem tough." It has the general tenor of a child trying to sound tough rather than the naturally coarse expression of an adult.)\n\nThe UI and gameplay feel very unpolished. One interaction I had jumped straight from "you shot and killed the bear" to "the bear is attacking you!". On reflection it was clear that this was meant to be the bear's dying action, but it seemed a good example of a generalized lack of polish.","July 29, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"
