Even those who don't understand physics or the construction process will get a handle on this because the ability to connect the balls together is so intuitive.

The game runs from very simple to absolutely difficult, and near the end you'll find yourself restarting levels many times in order to successfully finish them.  There are some special achievement like building a bridge with only so many balls that add more complexities to the game that I really enjoyed.

Strong recommendation.\n\nIf you just play through the game you wont be getting very many achievement from this game as most of them are tied to the games OCD flags which are a more challenging way of beating all the levels in the game.

The graphics looks really cute, even though, minimalistic, the sound, the sound is a ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece, the very best original soundtrack I've heard in my life, every track if filled up with emotions, the author of these (Kyle Gabler) did a great job.\n\nThe physics of this game is yet another thing. This is  A THING. As you're supposed to build in this game, the main role physics does play. It is just plain immaculate, you won't get disappointed. Yeah, for kids who haven't studied it yet it might be pretty difficult, but if you got some knowledge in that, you can beat it. But, again, you'll have to think.\n\nThe  whole story looks pretty simple at first: balls sucked by a pipe, wow. But the deeper you dig in the game, the greater the actual plot is, it is full of allegories, metaphors and what not.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/22000/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nWorld of Goo is an Indie-Physics-Puzzle Game developed in 2008 by 2D BOY. World of Goo is one of those quaint games that you would probably prefer to play on a mobile or smaller electronic device (with touch screen capabilities); in World of Goo you create bizarre contraptions with Goo to get to the end of the level.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You progress through the game being guided by "Signs" (or the "sign painter". But I always thought the signs were the side painter), you'll want to read every single sign in the game because they are quite humorous. The game is broken down into Five chapters, and each chapter would usually have 10-12 levels within the chapter.\n\nGame Play: Being a puzzle game, you need to spend a fair amount of time thinking, and once you get into the farther difficult levels, at times you'll need to restart the whole level because of one mistake. There is a requirement of how many "Goo Balls" you need to save at the end of each level to pass. So that means you can't use all your Goo on construction, you need to be as minimalistic as possible in your building.\nThe game starts out very easily and simple, but quickly gets complex and difficult. To construct, you click and drag a Goo Ball to a certain location near the starting structure to "add" to that structure. Generally after using that Goo you cannot reuse it... but some Goo has special properties that lets you reuse them, or have other special effects.\n\nAchievements: World of Goo has 8 Steam Achievements, all of which are pretty rough to obtain. (They went with Quality, not quantity) I only have 2 of those achievements at this time, most of them require perfect scores on each level... Getting all of the achievements will require a great deal of determination.\n\nPrice: World of Goo is priced at $9.99, I spent 6 hours playing through the game once. So for me that's not a fair price.... However, I picked up the game on a 90% off sale, so I've actually gotten my monies worth, and then some.\n\nConclusion: I recommend this game to people who enjoy puzzle and/or indie games, World of Goo was a very fun play through, and it only took one afternoon to get through it, so it's a nice quaint little play through. Depending on how good you are at puzzle games World of Goo does get pretty tough at times.","May 25, 2015","true","6.9"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamehoard/recommended/22000/","gamehoard","Jeremy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamehoard/","173 products in account","To hear the full review, listen to the episode on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]\n\nGameplay\n\nWorld of Goo is a 2D physics-based puzzler with gameplay that revolves around building structures out of "goo balls" in order to reach a pipe at the end of stage. While this is a relatively simple set up for a puzzle game, the way in which the developers build upon it and create puzzle is ingenious. There are constantly new elements being introduced, from goo balls that can be detached or float, to environmental obstacles that may interact differently with different types of goo.\n\nGoing along with this, the challenges vary greatly. While the end goal is always the same, the level design means that different levels require totally different strategies. One level may require you to build the tallest tower you can while another may require you to build a small mobile structure while avoiding saws or fire. Another may have you selectively sacrifice some of your goo. This combination of different elements and challenges means that the game never once gets stale or boring. Each level feels wholly unique and the steady progression of difficulty and complexity is finely tuned. I found myself playing World of Goo for much longer sessions than I set out to. One important aspect of this is "time bugs" which allow you to go back in time by just a single goo ball placement. This means that you don't have to restart a whole level every time your structure fails and keeps the game from ever getting frustrating.\n\nGraphics\n\nWorld of Goo is a real joy to look at. The game a sort of off-kilter cute but twisted look that is not unlike something in a Tim Burton film. It's a unique aesthetic that I personally enjoyed.\n\nMore importantly, the visuals inform the gameplay in important ways. All gooballs and obstacles look very distinct and little details give you clues about your environment, like leaves blowing around giving you an idea of the wind speed and its effect on your structure. The result is a game that is very easy to understand and interpret, allowing you to simply focus on the task at hand.\n\nSound Design\n\nIn a word: excellent. The game features a variety of different tracks with some pretty great orchestral scores. I found that this music really set the tone of each level and left me feeling surprisingly exhilarated for as methodical as the gameplay actually is.\n\nThe sound effects are also great, with many sounds that are simultaneously cute, funny, and gross.\n\nStory\n\nThe story of World of Goo is very vague and centers around the world-dominating World of Goo Corporation which harvest gooballs to make a variety of products. While it's never clear exactly what is going on, the story goes through themes of oppression, environmentalism, vanity, rebellion, etc. in an effective way. It exists more to evoke a certain emotion than tell a compelling narrative and, when combined with the music and visuals, is very effective in that.\n\nOverall\n\nEvery aspect of World of Goo works and, more importantly, they all work perfectly together. It's a near perfect example of an indie game and there is good reason for it to be considered a classic. If for some reason you haven't played World of Goo, I whole-heartedly recommend it.","May 9","true","8.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

It shines very brightly, and is a must-play for any indie game enthusiast (I have many many hours in this game, just not on Steam).\n\nEssentially, the goal is to build architecturally-sound structures to bridge gaps. Its like a wild version of Bridge Simulator. The building mechanics are really fun, but arguably the best part of this game is the artwork and definately the storyline.  While the story is quite abstract, but absolutely emotionally engaging.\n\nThe only negative I can really mention is that the game can feel a bit dated, at this point. I loaded it up this year and all the charm is still there, but the graphics and controls have not aged all that well. Regardless, its a classic.","March 18","true","0.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","13","14","3","0"

My attention was focused on this game the whole time.\n\nIt's one of those games where it seems extremely simple at first, but then the complexities and depth of it gradually shine through. The puzzles are neat, and I never had to use any skips until the last part (and I normally sucka t puzzles) but they don't feel easy, they feel satisfying regardless.\n\nThe visuals are nice, and they're crisp and good looking, and most importantly they do NOT resort to trying to look like pixel art. However, the game does run at a low resolution and there is no way to change it.\n\nThe soundtrack... Well, let's just say it's one of the best soundtracks in an Indie game ever produced. It is well performed, it is entirely originally composed, and it doesn't resort to sounding like chiptune or 16-bit stuff to try and manipulate nostalgic nerves. One of the best parts of the game for certain, and even better is that all of the soundtrack (the full versions, not the shortened versions in the game) can be found right on Youtube.

Either way telling the story through painted signs is kind of dumb. I think a narrator would have fit the game better.\n\nThe art design is lame to me, but some people might enjoy its jaggedness because it fits the story.\n\nThe game physics were very well developed for such a small development team.\n\nThe majority of the puzzles were challenging and manageable, but there were a few puzzles that were so hard that I honestly couldn't see anyone getting through them without using a YouTube guide.\n\nNo replay value whatsoever unless you're an achievement hunter.\n\nThe World of Goo corporation tower game isn't very enjoyable, it's really just a boring mini-game.\n\nI would recommend getting this game if it's on sale for $5 or less.\n\nThe game automatically adjusts to a 800 X 600 screen resolution. If you decide to run it full screen , you have to manually override the config.txt file (There's a guide on the World of Goo steam page).\n\nOverall it's a 7.5/10\n","June 17, 2014","true","9.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

In fact, it is one of my all-time favorite games. Everything about it is just sooooo good. That's all I can really say. World of Goo features great puzzles, unique gameplay, creative level design, cool graphics, and outstanding music. What's not to like??? Seriously, if you have yet to play this game, do yoursefl a favor and pick it up, especially at a low price like it is now.

You never feel that the game is "unfair" or that a click missed, or that the physics engine is being deliberately obtuse. The biggest draw though is that the game never gets dull. Just when you think that you might have done 2 or 3 similar levels, the game introduces a new mechanic through a new type of Goo Ball or some other challenge that keeps it refreshing and interesting.\n\nAbsolutely fabulous. One of those games where you'll find yourself racing back to thinking "Hang on.. what if instead of that, I try this instead...." - the satisfaction is immense.\n\nThe OCDs are well done as well.

If you can ignore these optional objectives though, however enticing, you will find a game that remains very enjoyable, albeit somewhat easy, the entire way through.\n\n\n8/10","January 16, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/recommended/22000/","LonMcGregor","LonM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/","303 products in account","World of goo is amazing.\n\nThis game surrounds the manufacture of products in the World of Goo corporation, by collecting various species of goo ball.\n\nAs a puzzle game it woks very well, with differing species of goo providing unique challenges. The physics of the goo balls can be tricky to manage, but that just adds to the fun.\n\nThis requires a mouse or touch device to operate. I managed to get it to work very well with a mouse, but I imagine it would also work well if you have some sort of tablet that can play this game.\n\nThe look and feel of this game is great. Making use of 2D graphics, but it definitely does not feel "flat".\n\nThe soundtrack to this game is almost too good. Dramatic when it needs to be, more subtle when that is required. Amazing stuff.\n\nThis game has leaderboards, so if you want an extra challenge you can try and beat them.\n\nI found no bugs while playing, but there was an easy to use .config file that I needed to edit to get a custom screen resolution. If you find this issue, just look into the game forums, the instructions make perfect sense.\n\nWorth a play if you like drag and drop puzzle or 2d sandbox type games.","May 24, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The levels range in difficulty, so some of the harder ones require a decent amount of skill to beat, and even more to master; that is the only thing that would restrict more casual gamers.\n\nA subtle, yet definitely present storyline behind it. A very surreal sort of aspect that creates an aura of wonder while at the same time being very lighthearted in practice.

Its a very fun game although its not entirely that long.\nYou can replay the level to try to obtain the "OCD" award for each. Its an objective thats normally much harder then is needed to complete the level nomrally. Most of the time its about saving extra goo balls then you need.\nLasty each completed level and rescued goo ball gives you goo balls towards building your own tower in an endless sandbox mode. You try to build your goos as high as possible and are constantly ranked against everyone else playing in the world. You don't see their creations only a cloud representing their height compared to yours.","October 1, 2013","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

On my Windows 8 multiple monitor setup the game had no options to select which monitor and caused all displays to blank for several tens of seconds during start. There appeared to be no way to shut the game down, or else the shutdown took several minutes and I gave up waiting.  A clear display showing the progress of launch and shutdown is required. My processor is an Intel i7 with an nVidia GEFORCE 710M, memory of 3.6 Gigabytes and the game did not exhaust any of the PC resources (memory, disk bus traffic, network, processor and graphics all Ok). Mouse sensitivity and acceleration (I set mine to none) were all correct. I'd probably recommend it with the caveat that one has to manually set the main display monitor before launching.","September 9, 2014","true","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's got a lot of puzzle variety and a pretty good amount of content. But it's so bare bones in certain areas that I was absolutely convinced it was a poorly done mobile port until somebody corrected me.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Dispite being a PC game first, it has no options menu of any kind, you can't correct the resolution, change the graphics (though I doubt you would need to) or even do something as simple as change the game volume. Distinguishing between the balls must be hell if you're colorblind, a menu option for that would have been really helpful for a lot of people. It does not lock the mouse to one screen if you have multiple monitors, but still requires that you move your mouse to the edge of the screen in order to pan the camera. It has no keyboard controls, even though it could have direly used some, such as the ablity to pan the camera with the arrow keys which would have delt with the mouse not locking issue, and a key for undo which would remove the need to click those stupid bugs (or more often, accidentally click one when you're trying to do a quick action).\n\nDid I like it? I kept playing through the problems and beat it, so yeah I must have liked it dispite its problems. At the same time, would I recommend it? no, especially not at the normal $10 price tag. I found the missing features made it feel very unpolished and at the price point there are a lot of better games.

The lack of video and sound control is an obvious inconvenience, but the flaws in gameplay are more worrisome. It's far too easy to accidentally place or drop a goo and far too hard to grab goos of a specific color in more complex puzzles. Fixing these shortcomings with keyboard commands (eg. CTRL+MOUSE1 = "release goo without using it") would have been pretty easy, but sadly it never happened.

No zoom, mouse to edges to move camera, and inconsistent connections (but that last one is probably just me being bad). These simple things, at least the first two problems, make the game an unnecessary struggle. It just seems lazy that they left the controls so poor. It also seems to have problem with multi-monitors (or maybe monitor resolution) but that can be fixed by modifying the config file’s resolution settings in the install location.

Some levels are just too zoomed in. You only get to see a small part of the screen at a time which means you have to move around and sometimes place goo at the same time. If you could move the camera with the keyboard then this might not be so bad but to move the camera you have to move your mouse to the edge of the screen.

Unfortunately, it suffers from a difficulty curve based only on how time consuming and frustrating certain levels are.  Most of the challenges rely on either counter-intuitive presentation (e.g. requiring the player to fling goo balls into an area that claims to be dangerous but isn't) or making the player guess what the physics will decide to do next.  The interface is mostly just dragging goo balls where you want them, but many of the levels require dragging specific goo balls quickly, which is often impossible to do because of the game not selecting the right one if there's any overlap.  This issue is then made worse by only certain goo balls being removable after placing them (which the player has to figure out themselves) as well as by the only way of reversing a move being to click on the little bugs that pop up for no explained or intuitive reason twice.  Not once, twice.  If you only click on one reversal bug, the game almost always reverts back to the most inconvenient possible situation.\n\nThe two biggest things I took away from this game was a deep sense of boredom and the feeling that the makers don't understand how an object's center of gravity works.

I personally got bored with it.\n\nPros: There is a lot of variety that the game offers. You will have to face each challenge the game hands out to you in a unique way. Your goal is to get all your blobs safely to the end of the level. The problem is as you use your blobs, some need to be sacrificed in order to save the rest. It all happens in real time. So if you have built a tower and begins to fall over, you have to quickly do something to save it. It can be challenging, especially if you want to reach the OCD award for completing a level. Which the award is given if you saved (almost) all blobs at the end of the level.\n\nCons: I got bored of it. Even though it has much to offer, it still felt kinda slow . Rather than asking the player what their knowledge of gaming is. It takes you by the hand and shows you every step of the way of how to finish the levels. It feels like a fancy iphone app that got ported to the PC.\n\nI got this game in a Humble Bundle. I wouldn't spend money on it anyways. I gave it a thumbs down because you don't need to spend money on this.","December 27, 2011","false","2.2"," 3 of 19 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","3","19","0","0"

There's very little I can say about it that's bad, mostly just that I didn't really personally enjoy it.\nThat being said, the one negative aspect this game does have is that there is a good degree of tedium involved. Some levels are painfully slow or repetitive, but not too many in the end. The level design is diverse, almost to the degree of being too much so as some ideas don't feel fully developed before the game ends. The graphics and music are wonderful and the story and humor present are pretty good too. This game mostly just fails for me on a gameplay level, as there's a bit of a luck factor involved in the harder levels, and no real difficulty curve to speak of. The level I found to be the most challenging (and one that put me off from playing for several days) was about at the halfway point of the game. There's also one World 1 level severely out of place, as well. And since you're required to beat every level to finish the game (well, you *could* skip them but where's the fun in that?) I could see that level being a real roadblock to many first-time players. There's also some metagame about bulding the tallest tower you can but there's not really any point to it. Like I said though, I can't say this is a bad game, just one I don't personally enjoy very much.","April 12, 2014","false","5.1"," 7 of 28 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","7","28","0","0"

Not a good recipe for a puzzle game.\n\nSimple game with great visuals, a fun soundtrack, and a solid premise. However, I do not recommend this game because of the physics. It is a physics puzzle game, but with zero control over what the free gooballs do and with unpredictable goo placement, it is needlessly difficult to build a cohesive tower without it toppling over. The puzzle should be in deciphering how to build a structure to get to the end pipe, not endlessly working the goos over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over because you can't get them to drop where you need them. Example: the Tower of Goo level should be a fun introduction on how to build tall towers; the solution is extremely obvious. Instead, you need to spend all your time retrying because the goos all run up one side of the tower and pull it down, or you can't get the goo to span the right previously placed gooballs. If I know where to put it to add integrity, and I simply can't because the game won't let me, I'm not solving a puzzle I'm rolling the dice. Even following a freaking youtube tutorial where someone beat the level, I couldn't replicate the solution. Does that sound like a puzzle to anyone else?\n\nI'm no stranger to difficult games, but at least with many of those you know what you're doing wrong.

The best part about this is that you have this sandbox area to build anything you want and how many goos are available are all the ones you were able to save throughout the campaign. The campaign itself was also quite an interesting ride by changing it up here and there while adding new elements to keep you entertained. I do have to say the OCD challenge is quite tough, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.

I enjoyed the earlier parts of the game when it was easy, but later on, the game gets painfully hard. The puzzles end up more as exercises in frustration, even after beating a puzzle the feeling is more of shame at having put three hours into a stupid map where you have to wait until a piece bobs right where you need it to be, and where one wrong move means erasing the last half hour of work. The number of music tracks are too few given the amount of time you spend playing the game--I ended up muting the audio completely rather than hear the same repetitive accordian melody. The visual design and physics themselves are strong, but the implementation of the physics makes them the centerpiece when they should just be something to help along the gameplay. Overall, I give this game a 3/10.","July 3, 2011","false","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was born from a much simpler game posted on the Experimental Gameplay Project (experimentalgameplay.com) entitled Tower of Goo, in which you attached little balls of oily 'goo' to one another via stiff strings of the stuff, in an effort to create a tower that's as tall as possible without causing it to buckle and fall.\n\nWorld of Goo takes this mechanic and applies it to a somewhat more varied kind of puzzle solving, introducing a myriad of different varieties of goo in addition to the basic black. (There's still a Tower of Goo mode, though, so worry not!)\n\nBasically: buy this game. It is wonderful and you will love it.","July 5, 2011","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels rough and messy, but not in the bad sense. I get the impression that the developers tried to go for that feeling. The game has been streamlined. (It's also not buggy.) The gameplay consists of puzzle solving, physics stuff and other great game styles (the gameplay style varies a lot actually, it never gets boring!). There's always an element of randomness (which is what makes the game feel slightly "messy"). The randomness can get annoying sometimes, but it also adds to that special atmosphere. It took me about 4 hours to complete World of Goo. Those 4 hours were great. Every level contains a non-mandatory "OCD" special tasks, e.g. solve the level in less than X moves, which will take probably another 6-8 hours to complete. Additionally, there are editors and fanmade levels / level packs out there if you still can't get enough of the game. There certainly is enough content available, even if it doesn't look like it at first.","July 13, 2012","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

World of Goo is almost instantly addictive for players of all skill levels, with simple controls and play mechanics that are easily grasped.\n\nClick and drag the adorable goo balls into position to construct towers, bridges, and other structures to reach your goal. You only have a limited number of goo balls, and since some of them need to exit the level safely, you'll have to avoid hasty decisions and start planning ahead. You must carefully consider where to place the next goo ball--and (when later goo balls with different abilities are introduced) WHICH goo ball to place. It may take a few tries (and retries...and maybe even MORE retries), but you'll feel a sense of accomplishment once you've nailed the goal. Even after you've beaten the level, you can replay it again later to see if you can figure out method of achieving the goal with less moves and faster times (the "OCD" goals in the menu beckon you to try this).\n\nThe art style is clean and colorful. All of the characters and interactive elements are distinctive on the screen, so you can easily focus on the task at hand. The sound effects are simple and cute, and the musical soundtrack is very well done. A large number of levels and a progressively increasing challenge means that you'll be coming back for more for a very long time.\n\nThis highly enjoyable game will put your logic skills to the test and bring a smile to your face.

At times, I often found I spent ages doing something for it to colapse anyway halfway through building. The last hull of the game involving the internet, was harsh on the eyes and a little painful to complete.  Overall, if your looking for a "fun" puzzle, skip this title.\n\nOverall, I think aside from going for the OCD achievments if you want to complete the tower in the freeplay mode, there is no real replay value and nothing to pull you back in aside from getting that few extra goos to build the tower with.  And like many physchic games, elements are introduced anmd kept basic, then forgetton for many levels, though its not as simple as other games it is still at times guilt of giving out simply no-brainer puzzles for you to solver.\n\nAt the end of the gday, this is going to be ones of those games you buy for it gimmick, rather then its fun factor and it won't appeal to everyone.  Yet despite this, if you love physchics puzzles, this is definately one of the best out there.  For that reason I give it a thumbs up, just because I don't like it doesn't mean its a bad game.

Featuring an unique puzzle-based mechanic and a wonderfully fleshed out world, World Of Goo deserves to be atleast tried. The little blobs of goo are instantly loveable and i swear they yell 'UNATCO' in one of the weirdest tribute to Deus Ex i ever heard. Your goal is to unite them together to form structures to get them to the pipe to escape their fate. Different goos have different stucture types they can make, but in the end, you need to get as many out as possibile. The story is a beautiful weird tale of love, conspiracy and greater good, and the game transforms itself everytime you think you might be getting your fill, making you play for just one more level.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chrismas95/recommended/22000/","Chrismas95","Chrismas95","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chrismas95/","405 products in account","World of Goo is an excellent game (primarily) about building triangular-based structures by stretching Goo Balls. The goal is to use whatever utilities possible to get a certain amount of Goo Balls to a pipe. And the game introduces QUITE A LOT of goo ball variations (from balloons to flingy Goo Balls). The game's story-telling via the Sign Painter and atmosphere are little things that leave an impression. The soundtrack is also amazing and fits perfectly with the setting you're put in.\nI've only had a few problems with the game. The first being its reset system. You're only given a couple of chances to rewind time, and most times you have to do it twice since the first sends you to a time when your structure is still falling. I've found myself restarting levels when I was at the end and made one mistake often. The second is the difficulty spike during the end-game. It's possible (I did it, after all), but the first level of world 5 must've taken more than an hour and halted my craving to play for a while. Also, OCD goals (getting the maximum amount of Goo Balls possible to the end)...I'm not touching that. But if you like a really tough challenge, go for it! Finally, the game takes dominance of your screen, so don't expect to do anything else on your computer without leaving the game.\nOverall, World of Goo is great due to its consistent freshness of mechanics as well as its nerve-wracking and sometimes emotional gameplay. It's one of those indie games that isn't as recognized as it should be. Go give its creators a sale at whatever price you think is worth it ($10 isn't bad for the 6 or so hours it took to beat)!","May 11, 2013","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Green goo, for example, can be easily detached and reused. Red goo can be used for balloons, perfect for lifting up unbalanced structures.

You'll get different challenges and different obstacles in your way such as environmental dangers like strong winds that could destroy your bridge.

The storyline shouldn't be passed up either since it adds a nice little spin on the take of the game. Lastly, the soundtrack is one of the best out there.

You'll get different challenges and different obstacles in your way such as environmental dangers like strong winds that could destroy your bridge.

But I did. Because that´s exactly how I felt after completing World of Goo.\n\nVisuals of the game are charming, physics is unique and story, although simple, is the most meaningful one I´ve seen in a long time - and is also presented in an original, refreshing way.\n\nGameplay is wise, with puzzles ranging from medium to hard difficulty. Some might take some time to figure out, but you won´t ever feel desperate and you will have some skips if needed. Good thing is also that there is some kind of replayability with possibility to perfect every level and use collected goo-balls to compete against other players in terms of building the highest "tower".\n\nThe icing on the cake is music - completely stunning for an indie game.\n\nBeautiful experience! A must play for puzzle lovers.\n\n***** 10/10\n***** 100%","June 29, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, they don't care about breaking the fourth wall because it's kind of funny when they do that, like when the Sign Painter just said "Yeah go ahead and skip this level it's impossible" or "The graphics will probably be fixed by the third level" and stuff like that.","December 27, 2013","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
