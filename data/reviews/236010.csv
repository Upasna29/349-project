"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grawitj/recommended/236010/","grawitj","BOT Hentai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grawitj/","1068 products in account","[!] Updaded my review according to some aspects.\n\nI won this game on SG from developer and since I love puzzle games - first thing I did was obviously install and instant play. Haven't played it too much yet, but it is enough to get the idea of the game.\n\n-= About the Game =-\nSo you are in control of futuristic bot-like creature on a land where is no escape and only thing you can do is solve puzzles. There are 25 puzzles available + extras, but the main idea of this game is to create and share puzzles too, not just play them. So I am sure in the future there will be an incredible amount of puzzles available.\n\nPuzzles concept is nothing too special. You have a layout with specific spaces marked in colours and also the same amount of cubes which you have to place in their marked position.\n\nYou have to place cubes via control of your robot character. Left mouse button pushes cubes, right one - makes them come closer. You can also use spacebar to jump and so far jumping has a huge role in this game.\n\nThis game has also a cool level editor as far as I have experienced.\n\nAll action is places in the middle of ocean with no escape and salted with 3 minutes soundtrack loop.\n\n-= Gameplay Mechanics =-\nSeems quite easy and simple, but it's not THAT easy at all. And unfortunately not just puzzles makes it to be so, but game itself too.\n\nControls are bit "floaty" with acceleration, which sometimes can lead to your robot going to swim, rather than pushing cubes around.\n\nYou can always use "c" key to go throught different camera modes (top-down, first person etc), which is really big plus for the game.\n\nYou can only move blocks straight line. Good thing is that they fix themself in to the nearest square automatically when they get moved, so it's easy to fit them in where you need them to be. The bad thing is that there are levels where you have to remove unecessary blocks via pushing them to water and since you are limited to blocks movements only by straight line, if you stand a bit aside of the block you wont be able to push it towards or away from you, so you will have to move right in front of cubes to do so which may take lots of time to do so.\n\n-= My Verdict =-\nIn general it is nothing special from other puzzle games. The only difference is that this game has different options of camera, etc third person view. Note, that I haven't encountered any bugs yet myself, but after recent updates game's performance became really bad.\n\nI cannot quite recommend it yet 100%, because those first two points I named above are important to me to enjoy this game and without them at the moment it's more like confusion and annoying equals the enjoyement it offers.\n\nAlso the game started to lag a lot, and I mean a lot. At first I was playing it on max without any problems, but suddenly after few of updates game just started to lag awfully and changing settings from low to max and back doesn't give any impact. Might be a glitch, hope it will be fixed.\n\nAt the end, the price of 11.99 euros is way too much for it. If you will get it for at least 2.99 or something like that and love puzzles - give it a try.","January 21","true","3.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","3"

It is presented well on Steam.  Bloxitivity is a 3D puzzle game. While it plays well and its controls are intuitive, its graphics are not its selling point. The sound reminds me of games from the early 2000s, with music loops that can get on your nerves quite quickly. The game seems to be put together well.\n\nIt is a very simple game, but the inclusion of the Steam Workshop allows for users to share their levels that they created. This extends gameplay beyond what's already included\n\nI do enjoy this game. However, I wouldn't suggest paying full price for it. I would wait until it is on sale. The current $12 asking price seems a bit high for what you get with this game.\n\nGame does include Steam Trading Cards.\n\nI would rate this game 3.5 stars out of 5.\n\nNOTE: I recieved a Product Key for this game in a giveaway","May 26","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanics are simple, you can move around the stage and jump over blocks, then solve puzzles by pushing and pulling colored blocks onto matching tiles. The main game has 25 levels and seems to be leaning heavily on user-generated levels for replayability.\n\nThe issue I have with this game, and the reason I can't recommend it, is I just didn't have much fun. This is essentially a sliding block puzzle in third, which makes solving the puzzles more slow and tedious than anything. The music is okay, but the art design is bland and uninspired; flat metallic cubes on floating platforms surrounded by a generic sky box. The player character is just a couple basic shapes crammed together. The story is delivered in static images and a small exposition dump.\n\nBottom line, there isn't much here, so unless you desperately need a third person sliding block puzzle game, this is safe to skip. If you do get it, at least it's functional, but I did have some physics issues (blocks that wouldn't fall off platform, pushing another block into them tended to knock over the hanging block though).","May 5","false","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

First of all the controls are not that great. Same for the camera angles. Also when first launching the resolution is all messed up. All of that aside the most important thing is, is that this game is simply not fun. In order to complete the puzzles you have to manually move blocks around. This is especially tedious becuase in order to move a block you have to be standing directly infront of it. Puzzle games should be difficult and fun. This game is just simply difficult. 3/10\nUnless you can get it for under $1 you should pass.","May 22","false","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

To be honest, the logo and promo art looks different from the actual art in the game. Obviously, in-game is 3D. I love the bright and colorful logo, but the color scheme in-game feels kinda gloomy. But this is probably because of the weather settings in each level. I've also tried the level editor and it's fun to create your own puzzles. However, it gets kinda difficult to use and when I added too many objects, the game started to lag. Reported this to the devs and they were helpful though. Overall, I recommend this game but I believe it can still be improved.\n\nP.S. Can I suggest adding an indicator of which levels I already completed? I always forget where I stopped.\n\nP.P.S. Controls can be a bit difficult sometimes. Depending on which camera mode you're using.","February 11","true","5.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
