"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nubblecakes/recommended/261570/","Nubblecakes","Nubblecakes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nubblecakes/","202 products in account","Truly one of the most gorgeous games ever.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\n- I bought this game on a whim after seeing it in the Steam Store for the first time. I watched the promotional videos and was immediately interested in it.\n\n- I love this game, therefore this review is biased. I am not some professional games journalist who makes a living off of reviewing games and tries to provide an objective and totally unbiased point of view on the subject material. If you were expecting such a review from the average Steam user, then your standards might be a bit high. No offense, high standards aren't really a bad thing. My intention with this review is to convince others who might be interested in the game to take the leap and drop $20 on it. That's all.\n\n- At the time of this review, I only had about two hours of playtime invested. Overall the game isn't terribly complex, and the gameplay is what you'd expect from the average Metroidvania title (with more focus on platforming than combat). It's polished, the art is beautiful, and the story is engaging while not getting in the way of playing the game. After two hours, I felt that I could wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who might show interest in it.\n\n\n\nREVIEW:\n\nIf I had to briefly describe the game, I would say it's a very artistically-driven 2D platformer with common elements from both the Metroid and Castlevania series. But that merely scratches the surface.\n\nI won't go in to excruciating detail regarding the gameplay. It's a branching world with areas you can't access without certain abilities. You progress naturally until you unlock a new ability, then more options open up and you can progressively explore more freely. Naturally, the world is littered with hidden goodies like health and energy powerups (like energy tanks and missiles from Metroid). Platforming does become rather challenging, and the fact that the movement is very responsive and feels polished makes platforming a blast despite the difficulty. However, a certain ability you are given right from the start can detract from the challenge by essentially removing the consequences of dying.\n\nCombat is pretty simplistic (you basically just spam the attack button and it auto-locks to the nearest target), but it is clearly not the focal point of the gameplay. The majority of the abilities you unlock cater towards more efficient and complex platforming maneuvers. There is a simple experience system which rewards you with skill points that allow you to unlock an assortment of abilities that are split off in to three different skill trees. These abilities are either unique passives, or augment the main abilities that you acquire through progression in the game.\n\n\nAs far as visuals go, this game is in my humble opinion at the very apex of gorgeous. The art style is surreal and brimming with color and personality. I'm not exaggerating when I say you could take a screenshot anywhere in the game and it would make for a great picture. There are certain areas in the game where you just have to stop and marvel at how downright beautiful the art is. Not many games these days are capable of that (the last one that comes to mind is probably The Vanishing of Ethan Carter). People might say that gameplay is all that matters, but this game is a prime example of why that's simply just not true anymore. I believe that in regards to modern games, visuals will always play an important role in making the game what it is. Games are a from of art now, not just pure entertainment. Anyone who plays this game and says otherwise is probably insane.\n\nThe musical score is just as good as the visuals. There's heavy use of woodwind instruments and a touch of harmonic female vocals that really set the mood. There are overaching themes throughout the score that gives the whole soundtrack real cohesion. The best part is that the music doesn't overplay itself during cutscenes to create a sappy, melodramatic mood. During general gameplay, the music is calmer and more relaxed. In turn, it helps to keep the player feeling the same even during the tougher platforming areas.\n\n\nThe story, while somewhat simple in nature, does a great job of presenting the game's gorgeous world and giving you a solid sense of pace. It's not a really big RPG story with tons of lore or anything, but you can still easily be enveloped by its provocative and charming nature. The game can even be surprisingly emotional and deep when you least expect it. Think of the art as a painting and the story as a frame. The frame may be simplistic, but it just goes great with the painting.\n\n\nMoon Studios have made a strong debut with this game, and I can't wait to see what else they have in store for us in the future. If you have the money to spare, I highly recommend you pick this up; or wait until the next big sales event and maybe you will find it for cheap. Either way, it's worth every penny.","March 10, 2015","true","9.6"," 1,139 of 1,218 people (94%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","94","139","1","47","40"

And yet Ori stands on its own.\nOri is intuitive; it's inventive; it's surprisingly challenging (I died over 200 times in the 10 hours it took me to complete it.) But damn, is it fun.\nEverything is seamless. And I mean everything. From the minimalist interface, to the controls, to the microsecond load time between dying and respawning - the latter of which you, like me, will come to know well. And equally well the fact that you can save, more or less, wherever you want.\nPower ups and ability trees keep things fresh, and like a good piece of Zelda equipment, every addition to your platforming repertoire opens up a whole new mechanic to the gameplay.\n\nThe story is as flawless as the game. (And the opening is as memorable as the ending. Have ready a bucket for your tears.)\nFew action platformers have a decent story to accompany it. Ori is different. No, the game doesn’t play itself; it isn’t one of those. Rather, like a player to respawn points (see: this game), gameplay and narrative are intimately connected; character actions are justified, and power ups serve the story and the player. The result is that each accomplishment you make is both rewarding and intensely satisfying.\n\nI testify to what others have said: the game looks beautiful, sounds beautiful, plays beautifully. Everything about it is stunning. But don't be fooled: it's beautiful *and* hard. If you aren't a skilled platformer now, play Ori and the Blind Forest. You will be.\n\n10/10","December 26, 2015","true","19.5"," 434 of 447 people (97%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","97","434","447","23","10"

Set to the tune of one this years most moving gaming soundtracks; the opening minutes of Ori and the Blind Forest evoke a sense of connection, playfulness and heartbreaking sadness all within its first 10 minutes as we witness our hero Ori, a sort of rabbit like creature that's been crossed with a squirrel then crossed with mini Chihuahua and his adoptive parent Naru, who resembles a bear crossed with an orangutan, lovingly bond. Like the best of children's fairy tales we witness these two form a deep connection in the woods of Nibel until a terrible tragedy occurs and it becomes the responsibility of the player, who guides Ori, to save this little slice of heaven which is brought to life by some of the most extraordinary visuals seen in any game this year.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=483515656\nNow for a warning! Don't be one bit fooled by Ori's whimsical veneer because underneath all this cuteness overload lies one of the years most physically demanding and challenging games. If you are easily infuriated by games that often require pin point precision and timing and are the kind of gamer who easily gives up in the face of what appears to be insurmountable odds (and believe me Ori provides many of these challenges) then sadly Ori may not be the game for you. I am not going to lie when I say this is one of the very few games that had me swearing and cursing with such conviction that even a sailor at the docks would probably have ended up blushing.\n\nThankfully the developers did not decide to go the route of autosaving rather enabling the player to save his or her own progression after a particularly gruelling section but there is a twist - you can't just randonly save which is done by creating a "Soul link" at your desired location since in order to do so you need to collect little blue orbs that enable you to create these save checkpoints but these blue orbs are also used to power-up certain abilities so the early stages of the game you will have to choose wisely over what you spend these blue orbs on.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=415137329\nOri and the Blind Forest plays out like many "metrodivania" games before it where the world is mostly open from the get go and travel to certain locations is only hampered by the abilities you have yet to unlock. Ori and the Blind Forest features a fair bit of backtracking and thankfully this is made easier thanks to a very intuitive and helpful map of the forest which becomes visible the more you explore or opened entirely if you find a map fragment for the area you are traversing. The game also features three main dungeons that take everything you have learnt up until the point of entering them and then proceeds to push you to your limits. In each dungeon Ori will face the threat of either lava or rising waters and escaping these areas will require much dexterity and muscle memory along with a good dollop of patience because you will die and die many times. That is a FACT!\n\nMy only complaint with Ori and the Blind Forest is that you cannot continue exploring the forest once the game is cleared so if you plan on searching out all the collectibles make sure to do so before you initiate the end game because from there on there is no way to return back unless you restart an entire new game. Also there is no New Game+ mode so restarting a game means you will have to unlock all abilities again right from the start.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=482909046\nOri and the Blind Forest is a game that has been lovingly and brilliantly crafted and easily ranks as one of 2015 best games. Level design is fantastic, it comes with a stirring soundtrack and is easily one of the years most gorgeous looking games that is priced reasonably considering the amount of gamplay on offer. It's an unforgettable debut by new kids on the block, Moon Studios, and one that immediately cements their reputation as masters to watch.

Well, Ori is one of those games.\n\nEven though perfection will never exist in videogames IMO, I find it really hard to search for cons into this game. Just notice that I was very hyped about Hotline Miami 2 for almost a year and I honestly admit that this hype banished once I purchased Ori.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest brings something new, something fresh, something NEEDED. I can't imagine the amount of work required to build a game like this but trust me people, devs can be hugely proud of it.\n\nVisuals are the closest to perfection I've ever seen in a videogame. Just see it for yourselves and get stunned about what a 2D platformer can give you. Seriously, you don't need to go to an art museum anymore. This game is well enough. From beginning to end it'll be impossible for you not to stare at every single detail, every singe hand-made background.\n\nThe tag "Great Soundtrack" is not one of the most voted without a reason. Such a great visuals strongly need a great soundtrack too, and that's what you'll find. Tracks add so much feeling and emotion into this game that together with the visuals it becomes one of the greatest combinations of the WHOLE industry.\n\nControls are tight and super fair. Mind this words: the game is challenging and every single death will be of your fault. This is the regular metroidvania where you get more movement skills as soon as you progress into the story. I found quite some similarities to the experience I got with Guacamelee (in terms of gameplay).\n\nThe story... OMG. Just when I thought I saw everything a 2D platformer could give (mostly soft and simple plots), this game appears. 20 minutes were enough for me to start clapping in front of the screen. This game has one of the strongest prologues I've ever played. AND IT'S IN 2D. SO MANY LIMITATIONS, YET SUCH AN INCREDIBLE EXECUTION.\n\nThe length is also good enough. Not too long, but not too short either. Map is extremely well planned, together with collectibles and secrets. Getting everything can perfectly give you 8-10h, which is more than the average platformer can offer.\n\nFinally, achievements are very well written too. This sounds stupid but it's sad to see some nice games where the achievements are completely senseless or wrongly directed. This game has every kind of achievement I like: storyline achievements, collectible achievements, movement achievements, and hardcore achievements.\n\nI think that the only con I can find to this game is that sometimes there are so many glowing things together that you can't really distinguish the friendly ones against the enemy bullets. But this mainly applies to one particular enemy and I'm partially colorblind so I can't say it's a con at all.\n\nOverall, just stop buying mediocre bundles nor triple A games. Do yourself a favor and pay 20€ for this game. We're in front of one of the best games of the year, and we're still on March. But seriously, this game is something I've never seen before (and I've played more games than I can count) and probably no one will dislike this game (aside from fake haters and people pretending to be funny).\n\nFinal Mark: 9.75/10 this is one of the best 2D platformers you'll play in a very long time.","March 24, 2015","true","34.2"," 537 of 592 people (91%) found this review helpful 77 people found this review funny","91","537","592","77","14"

The art is probably what stands out the most, but that's only because the controls are so well implemented, they never really took me out of this immersive - and touching - story. Not for a second, honestly.\n\nIt was sufficiently challenging for me as a seasoned gamer, but I'm more than sure it shouldn't be frustrating for any casual gamer who doesn't possess a really, really short temper. In fact, I cannot think of another game that made me care so little about dying and having to repeat the same difficult scenes. To the opposite: I was so excited by them (in no small part thanks to the amazing soundtrack and artwork that surely accompanied), that I sometimes died on purpose at the end of a tough part to try to play it again more perfectly. I feel like this is a really big deal and I hope you believe me.\n\nI can honestly think of only one con: you cannot (as of yet at least) continue playing your save after you finish the game. I wish I had known this before, because I truly wanted to go back and finish it 100% - something I'm not at all used to - but I'm sure I'll play through it again. By the way, I makes me happy that the Ori has TEN different slots for you and your family/friends to start a game on. I don't understand why so many games lack that.\n\nIn short, I HIGHLY recommend playing Ori, and I can see no contraindications to warn buyers of. Gameplay, art and soundtrack are truly remarkable, and the story is surprising and nothing short of beautiful. This is a game that stands out, and one to remember for a long, long time. Thank you and congratulations to the developers for making such a brilliant game, and selling it for such fair price.\n\nThings Ori reminded me of, while playing: Studio Ghibli, Rayman, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons, Guacamelee, Disney, The Lion King...\n\nI'll finish by quoting another reviewer: "Oh how I wish there were more games like this one, especially when they come out of nowhere like this one did."\n\nOne of the best things I've played.","April 2, 2015","true","13.8"," 222 of 231 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","222","231","6","0"

And the fact that world changes after your actions is pretty cool too.\nBut if you think that those cutesy looks cover a basic platformer - you cannot be mistaken more.\nThis game is hard as hell. At some points I would even call it "torture platformer" because, well, it's a torture to get through those segments.\nBut when you actually do - it's incredibly satisfying. I'd say it's very close to Dark Souls level of satisfaction after you figure out those hard parts.\n\nUsing the controller to play works best, but keyboard works pretty well too.\nOh, and did I mentioned this game was made using Unity?

Honestly, it's perhaps the most beautiful looking 2D game I've ever played in my entire life.\nThe environments are varied and interesting, the characters are adorable, the lighting is intense and colorful, the background paintings are stunning and the animations just make everything feel a lot more alive.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI played through this game in just 2 sittings and I can't wait to play through it again.\nEven tough I usually dislike MetroidVania game and I'm not too fond of platformers, this has easily become one of my top 10 favorite games of all time.\nDespite the fact that I usually don't give a damn about achievements, I want them all.\nDespite the fact that I have no interest in Steam playing cards, I will collect them, because I want the badges and backgrounds.\nIf you didn't buy it because it didn't seem like your thing, give it a try anyway.\nI think you won't regret it :)","May 14, 2015","true","18.9"," 128 of 130 people (98%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","98","128","130","10","3"

Not even like "solitary-tear-rolling down-the-cheek" crying. I'm talking "I-need-a-bucket-for-all-these-tears-how-can-I-feel-this-mUCH." For the next five minutes or so, I stumbled my way through the game, blinded by the river coming out of my eyes. I don't even know how these game developers managed to reduce me to this in such a short amount of time. I blame the soundtrack.\n\nOnce I finally managed to pull myself together, I was struck by the lovely art style- something I had heretofor been unable to fully appreciate in my sad, sad state. And then came the actual game. The controls feel very responsive, and the animations are smooth. I don't pretend to be an amazing platformer, but I think this will provide an adequate challenge for most players. I somehow managed to die 24 times in the first two hours- the struggle is all too real for me- but despite that, the nerd-rage never reached its peak. Once again, I look to the music. (It's quite calming, yet at the same time, it leaves you tensed for the next moment some story element comes to rip your heart out and leave you a sad, salty puddle on the floor.)\n\nIn conclusion: 10/10, would die again.\n\nUPDATE: Reading back over my review, knowing what I know now, I can't help but laugh in despair. Oh, sweet summer child. Dying 24 times in two hours? If only I had been able to maintain that ratio! 7 hours in, and I have now died over 400 times- most of that on one specific segment. Tears are in my eyes as I write this. Please, for the love of all that is good, do not underestimate this game. Let me be an example to what happens to those that do.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/261570/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Ori and the Blind ForestDeveloper: Moon Studios GmbH\nPublisher: Microsoft Studios\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nThe metroidvania subgenre has seen a lot of success in the past. Metroidvania (named for the 2 games that the term originates from: Metroid and Castlevania) games have very specific qualities and features that define it. The biggest of which is an expansive, inter-connected map. Other features includes secrets hidden everywhere, and progression being affected by new, unlockable abilities. They usually involve action-platformer elements as well. Ori and the Blind Forest perfectly fits all these criteria, and is one beautiful yet extremely challenging game.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nOri and the Blind Forest features a fantastic story, and you will most likely be moved to tears within the first few minutes. A quick (spoiler-free) rundown is as follows: The voice of the Spirit Tree in the forest of Nibel serves as the narrator, and the story begins when Ori fell from the tree during a storm as a newborn and was adopted by a sasquatch-like creature named Naru, who raised Ori as her own. After a series of events, Ori later meets Sein, a being who both guides Ori on his adventure and attacks enemies. In order to restore the forest, Sein guides Ori to recover the light of three main elements supporting the balance of Nibel: Waters, Winds and Warmth.\n\nTypical gameplay plays out like a platformer, with Ori learning new abilities as you explore and progress through the forest. Double-jumps, wall jumps, and more are all skills you will acquire and more than likely have to master if you wish to survive. There are enemies, shadow creatures, and more around every corner. And with Sein by your side, you have a way to defend yourself. At the press of a button Sein can fire off what's called Spirit Flames, which can be gradually upgraded with Skill Points. Skill points are earned when you collect a certain number of Spirit Light, which are dropped by defeated enemies or found hidden in dark corners of the forest. Skill points can be invested in 3 different skill trees, and you can spread points across all 3 trees if you wish.\n\nOri has a few simple stats, which are upgraded by finding collectable power-ups: Life and Energy. Life is, well, how many hits Ori can take before dying. Energy is used to fuel certain abilities, such as creating a Soul Link (used to save your game and spend skill points), Charge Flame, and more. Defeating enemies and destroying certain objects in the forest can replenish both life and energy.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nOri and the Blind Forest is a stunning game. It reminded me of Child of Light a lot. The backgrounds and foregrounds are very detailed, seemless, and flow smoothly as Ori traverses different sections of the forest. Speaking of sections, each one looks a bit different. Some are green and vibrant, filled with plantlife. While others are dark and dreary, covered with briars and the like. The cutscenes and character models are extremely well animated and polished. Everything concerning the looks of the game are nearly perfect. I couldn't find any flaws it in whatsoever. It's simply gorgeous.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe music is hauntingly beautiful, almost spiritual, and that is made apparent the instant the menu screen comes up. In some areas it's ambient and soothing. In others it is desperate and tense, and usually fiting the theme of each section of the forest. The sound effects are crisp and fitting. Spirit Flame destroying enemies, jumping off walls, running across lush vegetation...all sounds great. I have no complaints about the sound or music in this game. There's simply nothing to critisize here!\n\nPerformance\n==========\nOri ran at a very healthy 60FPS at all times on my mid-tier custom-built rig, during cutscenes and normal gameplay. I experienced no stuttering or lag at any point. No slowdowns, and skipping, and no random crashes or freezes.\n\nThe game has full controller support, which is *almost* a must for this game. Sometimes it requires precise button presses and platforming, which is made a lot easier with a controller. I didn't even try any other control schemes, as my controller worked so well.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nOri and the Blind Forest is one of the most beautiful and challenging games I have ever played. It shines in nearly all aspects, and is what I consider a near-perfect game. Lots of platforming, puzzles, and enemies to overcome make this a fulfilling Metroidvania title, and one that everyone should at least give a try. If anything, at least experience the opening story segments. If that hooks you, you are in for a wonderful ride.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nStory Intro:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ubZnGIK6g\nGameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WVVh_U7fX8\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nA Must Play\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","August 14, 2015","true","25.0"," 147 of 166 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","147","166","8","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/261570/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Ori and the Blind Forest feels like Nintendo’s second coming.\n\nDespite having no connection to the revered developer you can see Nintendo’s fingerprints everywhere in Ori, in a way that’s deeper than rudimentary inspiration or recreation. It’s a design philosophy, one which wraps around Ori and grants it a feeling of immense knowledge and cohesion. This may be Moon Studio’s first release, but it brings with it the passion and insight present in so many of the most beloved games ever released while simultaneously transcending them, feeling like the next step forward rather than a mere imitation.\n\nOri’s mechanical building blocks exist in a space that’s been exhaustively tapped and refined over the years (especially in the modern indie game industry), yet here take on a newfound innovation. It isn’t about “what” Ori is doing, so much as “how” is is executing it. There are countless precision and Metroid-like platformers now superficially working off almost the exact same routine as Ori, but what elevates Ori above them is its cohesion and forward thinking. It isn’t a collection of easily marketed parts assembled into a bizarre collage of styles and eras, but an astoundingly refined and unified vision that shares the same DNA as many of its peers but doesn’t allow that to define it.\n\nThe most impressive aspect of Ori is in how everything is working together toward the same goal. Level designs combine with a steady progression to create a sense of constant forward momentum; the presentation conjoins with Ori’s movements to feel alive and organic; ideas expand and elaborate on themselves as the difficulty scales to match, breaking at just the right moments to never hinder the pacing.\n\nThe level of skill with which Ori executes itself is remarkably precise and considered, even more so given its immense confidence which constantly reaffirms Moon Studios knows exactly what they’re doing. It’s not arrogant; it’s what allows Ori to so successfully advance beyond what has already been done.\n\nOne of the most surprising aspects of Ori to me is how despite utilizing many of Metroid’s (and maybe to an even bigger extent Zelda’s) progression systems, backtracking is almost nonexistent. You might pass through a repeated area here and there (or if you want to head back and pick up some stuff you missed), but there is almost always a reason for it which drastically alters how you now travel from A to B. Ori makes revisiting old areas engaging because it almost never feels like the same area anymore. Your abilities grow so quickly and steadily that by the time you return to a familiar spot you are now traversing it in a totally different way. This eliminated one of my biggest grievances with this style of game, in that so often they seem to start and stop as you travel between one area to the next, requiring you to retread old ground almost exactly as you already did once before. That never happens in Ori, which meant I was constantly engaged in what I was doing and how.\n\nWhere Ori had the biggest chance to fall apart was its difficulty, which is shockingly steep from the start and only goes up the further you progress. This is offset by how much can be visually understood about Ori’s level designs and how your character moves within them. Everything in Ori is in constant motion and with a great deal of discernible weight, which allows you to immediately know how far you’ll go with a jump, what’s in your path, and how you need to move past it. This certainly doesn’t make Ori anything approaching easy, but it does make it intuitive and approachable. It also makes it extremely fun just to move around and navigate the world, because it feels like you’re actually there interacting with it, feeling it move, discovering its secrets, and Moon has wisely left just enough room for human error that movement always feels organic and dynamic.\n\nIt’s also hard to miss how breathtaking the world you’re traveling through is, though it’s even harder to explain that through words alone. Suffice it to say that whatever you thinking Ori looks like or how impressive it seems from the outside, it’s nothing like experiencing it first hand and being a part of it. Ori is a technical marvel, sure, through its multilayered presentation, the astounding framing (with just subtle enough an angle to give it depth), and how impossibly smoothly Ori animates in collaboration with it. What blew me away though is how it never stops topping itself, and how much it is able to hold back for its most awe-inspiring moments while still being staggeringly pretty. It manages the difficult balance between wow-ing the player and not overwhelming them, and by the end even calling it the most gorgeous game I’ve ever played seemed an understatement.\n\nThere are a lot of easy things to praise Ori and the Blind Forest for, but it really is in how it comes together that makes it such a rich and enjoyable experience. It’s the feeling I get when I play things like Super Mario 3 or Super Metroid, which despite their age still present some of the best examples of concise, cohesive design which is missing from so many games. Ori understands this on a very deep level, and through that has created something  magnificent. It very well might be something that you can only understand through playing it yourself, but trust me when I say that’s something you want to do.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","July 14, 2015","true","7.8"," 154 of 176 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","154","176","5","7"

But this is intentional, and the save system complements this. You respawn in a fraction of a second and you don't get that helpless feeling of being dead and having to wait for it to load again, like in a lot of games.\n\nSuper Meat Boy is another extremely challenging game that does this well: the levels are small but the challenge is huge, but you die and respawn so quick that you're never sitting around waiting.\n\nAnd just like Super Meat Boy, when you finally do get through a really tough section it feels so rewarding.\n\nI'd much rather die repeatedly in one spot for 3 minutes then have an entire game that doesn't challenge me.\n\nThe game only took 10 hours to beat, which is surprising because it felt like much more.

The art, the characters and their animations, the lighting and the splendid instrumental music score will instantaneously create a deep feeling of immersion. The storytelling, most of which occurs in-game, will also be supported by small doses of narration and beautiful cutscenes, just enough to give you a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nThe gameplay is everything you could possibly wish for: tight and responsive, with top-notch level design and an increasing number of mechanisms to master as you progress, in pure Metroidvania fashion. The overall difficulty achieves a fine balance, making Ori both accessible to players who just want to enjoy the story and atmosphere, and challenging enough at times to keep veteran players on their toes. Exploration is rewarded with power-ups that give you more leeway to fill the simple-yet-efficient skill tree, which nicely complements the other abilities that you unlock as you advance through the game.\n\nA casual playthrough will last you a good 10 hours, and that alone would be well worth themoney. But Ori also nudges the more hardcore players into giving it another go with an online speed run leaderboard and some pretty tight achievements like completing the game without dying. All in all, a very fair amount of content for its price tag with refined quality on top of that. The standard for an up-to-date adventure platformer and a definite recommendation for me.","January 3","true","11.9"," 101 of 106 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","101","106","7","3"

Now.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest is in my opinion, pretty close to the perfect 2D platformer. Stunningly beautiful visuals, tight, responsive controls and smooth animations. Interesting, progressive abilities, puzzles that are just hard enough to make me feel smart, hidden secrets and replayability, topped off with an excellent soundtrack. I really have nothing negative I can say about it.\n\nPlatformers are not my biggest strength, and this one is a challenge - but it's a challenge that can be overcome, even if like me, you're going to spend half your playtime watching Ori dying horribly. I'm so sorry Ori. I tried my best.\n\nEvery single time that your cute protaganist falls to his death, it will be your fault. I've played a lot of platformers that are frustrating because the level design is against you, the controls just didn't respond, the animation was too slow. There's nothing worse than feeling you're failing because of design flaws - but Ori doesn't feel like that. It feels like I'm failing because I'm old, and slow and that's fine - if even I can eventually manage it, anyone can and it makes it feel so much better when I finally achieve it. There is an achievement for completing the game without dying, and I will never get it. I'm proud to go 5 minutes, which is around my personal best so far.\n\nFinally, I was not expecting plot in my platformer, but this game has it and that really was the icing on the delicious, Ori-shaped cake. A gripping prologue draws you in and makes you care not just about Ori, but the entire forest. It's a simple plot, but it's charming and emotional. So just in case anyone actually read this far, stop thinking about it, get playing it.

Ori and the blind forest is a small game, it costs only friggin 20€, is 8-10 hours long (which is long for an indie game) and those 8 hours I played it were so much fun, but also so inspiring for me, someone who is very interested for game design, because Ori is a game so well designed, no compromises (which means smaller target audience) which is really rare these days. But thats the way to make a game as good as possible and these guys managed to do that. There are some very minor things which were bad like sometimes visibility was a problem, but the core design of the game is perfect.\n\nGameplayI just want to give the devs huge credit for making no compromises. Every decision they made for this game feels like they made it because they want it to be the best game they can make, and not a game which the most people possible will play to make the most money. That means this game is really hard sometimes, but never unfair, and the difficulty curve is really good and also they teach the player really well except one thing I´ll explain later. This also means the game can be frustrating for some people, because they made a save system which can make you replay long sections of the game, but this save system is really smart. Its like a manual save system with quick-save only, but you cant abuse it, you cant make 100 saves and for a metroidvania/open-world game that would be fatal, so they made this save system which makes so much sense for this type of game. I just want to make clear how important this is in my opinion, because many games ♥♥♥♥ up stuff like this and make checkpoints all over the place which takes out the challenge. It can be annoying, because at first you will maybe forget to save sometimes, but youll get used to it. Also saving is not just a feature tagged onto the game, it is a mechanic which complements the rest of the game (you can even upgrade it and stuff) and its also a real thing in the lore of the game.\nWhat I also love about this game is how everything is focused on one thing, the platforming. I hate when developers make a game and tag on tons of features which dont bring depth, they only do it to have more content and variety because their main gameplay has not enough depth to keep you motivated. To explain this we can compare Ori to Guacamelee (which was a good game). In Guacamelee you had settled combat sections, platforming sections and boss fight sections. Sometimes you had platforming and combat combined and all of your combat moves were also platforming moves, but you still had this split. In Ori everything is a platforming section, every enemy you encounter is platforming and not combat (at the start of the game its combat to teach you its combat mechanics). The way enemys are designed and placed throughout the world are only that way because the devs knew this is a platformer.\nI also want to give them credit for their smart progression system which not simply fulfills the role to make your character stronger, it focuses more on giving the player more tools to play with, which bring more depth to the game, so the game actually gets harder without getting unfair. So enemys dont have simply more health and damage and the traps are not simply faster than before, you just have to combine more "tools" at your disposal, make more decisions as a player.\nI could talk hours about this game´s design, so let me quickly summarize the rest of the gameplay:\n\n- really good controls, perfect with mouse and keyboard\n- extremely smooth movement\n- lots of variety in enemy and level design\n- optional areas\n- rewarding exploration\n- tons of MEANINGFUL collectibles\n- big variety keeps you motivated throughout the whole game\n\nThere was one thing in this game however which was a little annoying. Sometimes (like 2-3 times only) it was hard to see where I am supposed to go, this was mostly in sections where you had to move fast. In these sections you have to be quick, dodge obstacles and at the same time look where you have to go and suddenly they want you to use a mechanic you rarely you used in the game. This also happenend at the last "boss"fight. The thing was you can use your bash on enemys and enemy projectiles, but you can also use it on boulders, but only on small ones, the game never tells you this. I tried using it on a normal boulder and it didnt work, so I thought you cant do that. But this is just a small thing.\n\nNarrativeSome people might say the narrative is barebones, and they would be correct, but the developers did the right thing. There is some text and some cutscenes but all of that is really short and spread throughout the game. You never get interrupted by annoying story-sections. However the narrative that was there was a little bit too cliche for my taste, but thats not a big deal. They created some really interesting and cool characters, and those characters never even talk.\nThe most important thing (as always for me) is that the narrative keeps you motivated and complements the gameplay, its not a seperate thing. Also the ending was very satisfying and well made.\n\nAesthetics/ GraphicsThis game is beatiful. I think thats obvious. Not much to say really. You can compare the graphics to Rayman Legends, its almost the exact same style. The animations are not as smooth as in Rayman Legends, but they are still really well made. But I have to say Rayman Legends is a little cleaner, I always could see enemys and obstacles. In Ori it was sometimes hard to tell if something is solid or not (sometimes something is solid, you can stand on it, but you can also jump on it from below, sometimes you cant), but its not a big deal. Unlike Rayman Legends though, where every level is a seperated from the rest of the world (loading screens), in Ori you have a full open world, everything is connected, you have no loading screens and you never get lost because of a really well made map. I say that because there are still games these days where they even ♥♥♥♥ up the map.\n\nSoundtrackThe soundtrack is really good, but its stuff you already heard a lot in other games and movies, especially the main theme sounds very familiar. But its still really good, fits the game and there some tracks which I really love. Overall though its not THAT memorable.","March 23, 2015","true","8.5"," 90 of 94 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","90","94","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrattle/recommended/261570/","vicrattle","Optimus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrattle/","194 products in account","A stunningly beautiful metroidvania platformer that is rock hard.\nThe aesthetics are some of the best, if not the best, I've ever seen in any video game. Every background and foreground object is hand painted to awe-inspiring effect. This combined with the incredible soundtrack from Gareth Coker[majornelson.com] adds up to be one of the most stunning displays I've had the pleasure of enjoying. On top of the amazing visuals and soundtrack, we have a heart-wrenching story to go with all this that will definitely leave at least some (me) in tears throughout.\n\nNestled within all this beauty is an exquisitely executed metroidvania platformer. Ori boasts fluid controls while still being extremely tight. It’s as if Moon Studios took the best aspects of Rayman Legends and Super Meat Boy’s controls with the result being a perfect marriage of the two vastly different titles. The progression of skills is steady and follows a logical succession. At first you’re barely able to jump over the smallest log, but by the end you’ll be nimble like the adorable little forest sprite that you are.\n\nAbove all else, this game is HARD. Maybe not as hard as some of the most infuriating levels of Super Meat Boy, but the inspiration definitely shows; be sure to save often because the last thing you want is to die unexpectedly and have to go through that hell again. Then again, maybe that is exactly what you want. In a market where it’s increasingly taboo to actually kill the player in a single player game, Ori has no qualms with killing you over, and over, and over again. That said, the deaths are never cheap or feel like the result of poor level design or other shenanigans; it’s abundantly clear that if you die, it’s your own fault.\nI want everyone to play this game and love it as much as I do. I look forward to getting as many of the achievements that I can, no matter how difficult some of them seem to be.\n\nTo Moon Studios, thank you for delivering such an incredible experience. This is why I love video games. I can’t really express just how much I’ve fallen in love with Ori, Sein, Naru, Koru, and all the other characters in this masterpiece.","March 12, 2015","true","63.8"," 69 of 76 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","69","76","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkicoll/recommended/261570/","genkicoll","genkicoll","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkicoll/","1184 products in account","Options include Resolution (640x480 up to 1920x1080); Windowed or Full-screen; Damage Values, and VSynch on/off; language, and separate sliders for Music and Sound Effects, Vibration (if you're using a controller), Brightness, and Contrast.  Controls CANNOT be re-mapped, which is a shame... I'm so used to the Donkey Kong 64 and Banjo Tooie-type of controls that some of the actions would have made more sense to me if I could have changed them.  FYI, I played the game on a controller, but it can be played with mouse/keyboard.\n\nOri is a platformer with puzzles and RPG elements. There are three skill trees, which you expand by finding power orbs and taking out enemies.  For those not familiar with the idea, basically you have sets of skills that you can upgrade as you progress through the game.  Maybe you'd like your attack to be more powerful, your map skills to be expanded, or you'd like to be able to re-use your "Soul Link" (save points) without having to use up your valuable power points.  You can have all of this and more, and you get to decide the basic order of the improvements.  Some upgrades you cannot "buy" with your skill points, as they are triggered by in-game events.  Want that uber-useful double-jump?  Sorry, you'll have to wait 'til you get to the appropriate part of the story!  There are many achievements to be had, places to re-explore once you have new abilities, and plenty of hidden areas to find.  There are no portals for fast-travel, which is a shame, but to be fair, once you have all (or most) of your abilities, it doesn't take all that long to go from one end of the map to the other.\n\nSomething you absolutely need to remember to do is to SAVE THE GAME!  I had to replay quite a few scenes early on in the game because I kept forgetting that I needed to save :p  There ARE some automatic save points, but they're not spaced very closely together!  You have been warned!\n\nYou've probably heard about how full of "feels" this title is, and it's completely true -- This game could make even the most stoic of players teary-eyed.  The graphics are gorgeous, the imagery evocative, and the music simply breathtaking.  The way the devs combine all of these elements makes for a moving and emotional experience.  This is not to say that the game does not have flaws, for it certainly does, but the good outweighs its shortcomings in my opinion.\n\nThat being said, I love this game and I hate this game.  It's addictive, it's frustrating, it's fabulous, and it's quasi rage-inducing.  Sometimes I just couldn't stop playing, and at others, I just had to walk away.  I've seen some reviews which say that it's not overly-hard, but I have to say that for me, it IS overly-hard at times.  Sure, most of the gameplay is set at a very doable difficulty level, but then there are also those times where you just want to hurl your controller across the room and scream expletives at the screen.\n\nThere are two elements that cause this extreme flare-up of emotion:\n\nThe first would be the puzzles that require perfect timing and lightning reflexes.  This first shows up when you learn one of those story-triggered upgrades I mentioned.  It's an element I've not seen in a game before; one that allows you to hurl an enemy's projectile (or the enemy itself, in some cases) in any direction you choose, whilst simultaneously jumping in the opposite direction.  Hard to explain and harder to master, and you MUST get a firm grasp of this mechanic in order to progress in the game.\n\nSecond are the running sequences... Those blasted running sequences! >_<  It's certainly an interesting plot device, but hard as heck, and no save points along the way.  This is one of those instances where the game auto-saves right before you start, and you're going nowhere until you complete the sequence.  Period.  Die and start over again from where you began running.  GAH!\n\nThe game suffers both from moments of game-halting frustration and lack of important information (aka plot holes.)  For instance (not a spoiler) I completely did not catch that the forest was actually *dying* until talking to someone about the game... I thought that the seasons were simply changing and that winter was approaching.  There are little things like this scattered throughout the game that make you go "Huh?" but are not so in-your-face as to completely disrupt the immersiveness.\n\nOverall, I have to say that Ori and the Blind Forest is an absolute must-have and a must-play, but if you're a less-experienced player, you might wait to see if the developer will update the game to add difficulty choices... Lest you end up with a hole in your wall the size of your controller ;)","November 11, 2015","true","23.9"," 80 of 94 people (85%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","85","80","94","12","14"

The gameplay is fun with many skills to acquire as you progress, there's also a talent tree to spend your points on.  World of Ori is beautiful and mysterious, you want to know more of it and the game does it well.\n\nThe best parts of Ori are definitely the incredibly beautiful story, music and artstyle, it's hard to explain how it is, you just have to see it for yourself. When the music kicks in at different areas of the game, it makes you feel a lot and it keeps you going to see more of this amazing game. It's some of the best music I have heard. Sometimes it reminded me of songs I heard in my favorite movies like The Lord of the Rings or games like Shadow of the Colossus. The story is emotional too and you want to see how it ends <(^_^)>, I admit I shed a few tears in certain moments.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest gets more difficult, the further you get in the story. In quite early of the game, I thought damn this is hard...but it was nothing yet. The end stage gave some of the most challenging obstacles I've had to surpass in a while with games, which resulted in countless of deaths lol <(T_T)>. The game has a lot of puzzles in it which is great, but also a lot of backtracking when you unlock new areas, I didn't mind it though.\n\nI think it's the first 2D platformer game I've played in a long time. I remember playing Sonic the Hedgehog during Sega Genesis era a lot and another one was that thing called Ray Man, but I don't think I had many games of this genre afterwards.\n\nIt's safe to say, that Ori and the Blind Forest is one of my all time favorite games after finishing it :), I loved it. Was great to come back and play a platformer again. It took me about 11-12 hours to finish the story, but it can take a lot longer depending on how you play it and how fast you solve puzzles and overcome enemies. For me, it felt like it took a lot longer to see the end and it was hard to stop playing sometimes.

Leading to a disorientating feeling much like what some people experienced with Mario Galaxy.\n\n\n\n\nOverall I highly recommend this product for those seeking a AAA quality platformer without the AAA price tag.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ylzor/recommended/261570/","ylzor","Ylzor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ylzor/","183 products in account","At first, I thought Ori and the Blind Forest was just going to be a beautiful game with basic gameplay. Not only does it play really well, but it also blew me away with its graphics, music and its touching story even though I knew what the game looked like before I played it. But it's only when you start playing (with a controller or keyboard/mouse, both work well) that you get it. Just watching the game is not enough ; you have to play it to fully understand what the game really wants you to feel.\n\nIt's not an easy game, but it's not so hard that it makes you wanna punch your screen or anything. I've read some complaints about the game having too much "die & retry" in it. I disagree, as there are only 2, maybe 3 scenes in the game that can be considered that. The game always stays fair though, and it's just hard enough to make you feel like you're never really safe, even though you already picked every single health bonus you can get.\n\nAnd those bonus can be really fun to look for. As a metroid-vania, you'll have to come back to some parts of the world using shortcuts you just created with your new powers. There's no teleportation here, everything is connected, yet it never feels like a pain to go back anywhere. Maybe it's thanks to the amazing graphics and music, but travelling back to a place you've already been to is always a pleasure. But it won't just be running, as enemies are always present in the game and will respawn.\n\nCombat is pretty simple and easy ; press a button and a homing attack will deal damage to an enemy. You still have to dodge though, as Ori is very fragile, especially early in the game when getting killed in one or two hits is not rare. It gets easier though as you gain points by killing enemies and finding sometimes well hidden orbs to make your little guy stronger or to show things on the map. You can create a save point yourself, and you should since the default save points are rare. It has a cooldown and requires energy though, but those can be reduced if you spend your points in the right place.\n\nAnd saving is really important, since you'll die a lot. Not necessarily because of enemies, but because of the platforming element of the game. Don't get me wrong; the game controls perfectly and some moves are just amazing both to look at and to do. Some jumps are not easy, even though it never gets as crazy as, let's say, Super Meat Boy, but none of them feels unfair. Sometimes you'll get to a place and wonder how you're supposed to make a jump that seems impossible to do, but in the end you just do it naturally. I won't spoil the moves you get later in the game, but I'll just say that I've never liked the "Y" button on my controller that much before.\n\nIn short, this game is a masterpiece. If I had to find something wrong with the game, I'd say the game is a bit short (I read 10+ hours, I finished the game in less than 7 hours, taking my time and exploring a lot). For 20 eurodollars (I'd say the same for 40 though), this is a game I highly encourage you to buy. And buy the soundtrack too, even though it isn't the same without the rest of the game, it's still amazing.","March 11, 2015","true","20.9"," 54 of 60 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","54","60","0","0"

I could talk about the controls or the level design, which are normally the most important points for me for any platformer... If I did that, I would be comparing it favorably to the best platformers I've ever played. But in spite of the game's excellence in those areas, it is its visual and musical supremacy that sticks in my mind.\n\nFriends of mine, even friends who don't normally like platformers, beg me to stream this game for them, equating it to "audiovisual crack". Occasionally—even after my third full playthrough—I find myself stopping, overwhelmed for a few moments by what I'm seeing. It has set a new visual standard for me, one which every other game I've played to date falls well short of achieving.\n\nAs for the music... In-game, it is sublime and nearly seamless. It isn't that it sets the mood of the game, nor vice versa; the soundtrack and the rest of the game simply... complete each other. Perfectly. To the note. And, listening to bits of the soundtrack outside the focusing influence of the game itself, I find myself moved in ways I have never been moved by music before.\n\nI am normally loquacious and pride myself on my vocabulary, but words completely fail me when I try to describe how this game looks and sounds and feels. Very few games have had this kind of impact on me. This is the sort of release that comes once per decade, or less.\n\nBUY IT.","March 30, 2015","true","53.8"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","45","47","6","0"

It is so beautiful that it will make the most hard-boiled redneck cry before he even made the first jump. Beside the graphics that also counts for the story - it may lack depth, but it delivers very straight points on innocence in a really beautiful way. No thats not childish.\n\nThe gameplay is easily one of the best that has ever been made for a platformer. It is elaborate enough to recommend Ori for people of all ages. It makes it literally fun to fail & try again, which is a rare quality in games these days.\n\nBeside that, Ori is insanly difficult at times (yes thats a good thing). Whenever you feel like you start to master all your movement skills, a new one is discovered, and there are 3 key sequences in the story that are just ridiculously hard. I died exactly 785 times in those 20 hours of my first playthrough and there are achievements for completing this game in less than 3 hours and without dying. Thats just dark humour at its best. Anyway, I shall go now and succeed in that or die trying. TO THE FOREST.\n\n-----\ntechnical performance: for me the game was running very smooth & without any problems whatsoever on maximum settings (on Win8 bootcamped on an iMac, which caused trouble in the past for other games). However, some achievements seem to be bugged. I personally dont care about that, but if someone is into achievement hunting, then probably better wait with buying until this has been fixed.","March 26, 2015","true","22.2"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","41","46","6","0"

I really hated to put an end to it. Maybe I was just addicted to being tortured by it. In my mind, Ori and the Blind Forest is a really excellent game in story, graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay. It’s flawless, I may say. It creates something new and surprising and remains classic at the same time.\n\n\nGraphics: Amazing, incredible, fantastic, ridiculously awesome, everything. I was so surprised when I started the game for the first time. The color expression and dynamic effects are perfect, just like a Disney movie! It’s a 2D game but it gave me strong sense of 3D. Shaking branches, leaves in the wind, water waves when raindrops fall in the water...every single detail is so beautiful. Sometimes I felt so delightful just staring at the screen. There are three elements defining three different styles maps: water element, wind element, and warmth element. There are different theme colors for each element. Dark blue for water element, grass green for wind element, red for warmth element. It’s really immersive in different scenes. Especially in the map of warmth element, I just could feel the heat around! There are kinds of monsters in these scenes: monkey, bat, rhinoceros, and some nasty insects and spiders. Every monster was designed delicately especially the monster which could split in many little ones. It’s really disgusting but it’s well done!\n\n\nSoundtrack: I’ll give it 120 points out of 10. When starting the game, there was a long cutscene. I always skip cutscenes but when I heard the background music of Ori, I stopped myself skipping it. It reminded me of Zootopia, Frozen... It was so Disney anyway! The music changed when I stepped into different maps. When I started with water element, in thorn bush, the music was gloomy and deep, even a little creepy. Was I too sensitive? While after the water was purified and in maps of wind element, the music become relaxing and light which reminded me of those amazing background music in Harry Potter. Then it turned into marches in maps of warmth element which made me really anxious. Besides those different music for different maps, there are exclusive music for three escapes. They almost killed me, literally. They were really stressing and tense but with background music, I was filled with determination and passion. Even if I love these special escapes, they were nightmares with no doubt. Besides background music, the dubbing was amazing as well. I couldn’t actually get what they were talking, but it sounded cute. I liked that!\n\n\nStory: plot was simple. It was just a story about a little animal influenced enemies with his kindness. It was very simple and enough for a platformer game which lasts about 10 hours in length. Other creatures except Ori didn’t show strong and obvious personalities. But it seemed they were designed to be creatures which didn’t know how to express their feeling so it was fair. I believe most players might be very touched by the big bird’s sacrifice for Ori.\n\n\nGameplay: smooth move, excellent combat, fair puzzles, and reasonable ability tree. It was almost perfect... Except the difficulty. When I first saw this game, I thought it was just a little relaxing game for girls which was easy to get finished. But you know what, it turned out to be so unfriendly. Even if I had watched many playthrough, I actually knew what I had to do, when I was literally doing it, it was so different and I really died a lot. You need to be very accurate, and sometimes it was so close, then you would understand why we changed our keyboard over and over again. However, I have to say the skills are very interesting especially “bash”. It was so refreshing when I got that. If you used it correctly, you might probably avoid most damage and attack. The hitfeel was really good! You will absolutely love it. Given that the difficulty was high, Ori gave players a really creative and friendly save method. You may save files almost anywhere anytime. It’s the key that makes the game become so excellent. This creative save mode changed the torturing difficulty into interesting experience. And the amazing graphics and soundtrack also made players feel delightful even when running back and forth. If you ask me if there’s any tricks in the game, I will definitely say “ save as much as you can”. Although the difficulty is high to most people, there are some talented people post some videos like “speedrun” “zero death”...etc. I watched those video and the operation was too amazing to do. At least I couldn’t do it at all.\n\n\nConclusion: flawless graphics, surprising soundtrack, simple but touching story, high difficulty with friendly save mode, if you love platformer games, Ori and The Blind Forest will never let you down. However, I have two complaint: I couldn’t change the controls, it didn’t make sense! Using keyboard drove me crazy. And it didn’t give me a chance to explore all the maps! When I finished, the game ended. If I want to get in again, I have to restart at the beginning like the first time so I can’t finish all the achievements. So if you like exploring everywhere in maps and really need to finish every single achievement, you better watch!\n\n\n9.5/10","April 20","true","23.2"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","29","30","0","3"

The art is nothing short of stunning for a 2D platformer, I watched the trailer and went "Pfft, graphics are probably cranked up and ones we won't get at all." Pleasently surprised on that one when I loaded it up and it was exactly the same as the trailer, the same beautiful backgrounds and the soundtrack that pulls it all together.\n\nOne of the few games that actually had a decent story in the recent years (a 2D platformer no less), games seem to have been lacking engaging story, story that actually makes you care, that makes you want the character to succeed not simply so you can reach the end. One of the few that have actually caused a tear to come to my eye.\n\nOnto the negatives (few as they are), there are some sections that left me puzzles for a while I got stuck on one area, wondering how to proceed for about 20 minutes, I got it eventually and really enjoyed it. That being said some areas require trial and error, can I survive this? Whats down this hole that I cant see the bottom of etc. There were some difficulty spikes (you'll know them when you see them) but that being said they were welcome. I don't want the game to hand me the victory like so many new release games, the victories you make by beating these spikes feel amazing. I truely felt a sense of accomplishment after going through these challenges and surviving.\n\nThere's so much more I want to write and yet I can't because it would ruin the beautiful experience that Ori and The Blind Forest can give you. If you have a 20 spare, think about putting it into Ori, best money I've spent this year so far.\n\nHappy Gaming\nCinderpalm","March 30, 2015","true","9.2"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","0"

It’s truly a work of Art. The Story, the art style and the wonderful Soundtrack … everything works in harmony.\nI’m not gonna lie when I’m telling you that, at one point in the Story, I started to hate the game at one point but let’s get to that later.\nPlaying it was exciting and calming at the same time. Exciting as in exploring every angle of the world, learning more about the Story and calming as in just embracing the wonderfully crafted world and listening to the genius soundtrack that comes along with it. Not to mention even the slight narration is something that just manages to give the game way more depth.\n\nStoryThe Story, narrated by the voice of the Spirit Tree, is about a Guardian Spirit named Ori who fell from the tree during the Storm. A creature called Naru adopted the newborn Ori and raised her as her own. They live happily and in harmony up until a cataclysmic event withers the forest and therefore the food supply.\n\nI’m terribly sorry but this is as much as I can say about the Story. One of the memorable events in the game happens right in the prologue and I seriously don’t want to spoil anything.\nI’m just gonna say this … The Mother makes sure that her Child survives at a cost. You can guess what happens and it truly caught me off guard and later in the Story I was at a point where I was about to hate the game for making me so emotional again since all of a sudden something happens and you’re left alone with all your emotions and …\n\nThe Story is genius. That’s all I can say.\n\nGameplayOri and the Blind Forest is a 2D Metroidvania with a strong plattforming focus.\nThere are a lot of jumping puzzles and many secrets to be explored and found and all that happens in one of the most beautiful and atmospheric worlds in the industry.\nLater on you meet a being of light called Sein which acts basically as your guide and your weapon. You shoot so called Spirit Flames which will attack the nearest enemy meaning you can’t specifically aim at one enemy. You have to be close enough to it for you to be able to actually attack it.\nSomething to mention is that the controls do actually feel pixel-perfect and the game itself, while looking rather cute, is really challenging. Every death will be your own fault. The game does have save points but those are pretty rare and once you die you will lose everything you managed to accomplish since your last save. While this might sound off putting in truth it isn’t.\nYou’re able to create a Soul Link if you happen to have enough energy, granting you the ability to save your game whenever you want to and also accessing your Skill Tree so you can decide how to spend your Ability Points to either develop your Combat, Utility or Efficieny.\nAs the name says the Combat Tree enhances your power and helps you to quickly deal with your enemies, while the Efficiency Tree gives you access to abilities like Triple Jump or being able to breath in clean water.\nThat being said the controls are fluid and fit. I haven’t had any problems at all with the controls or the gameplay in general quite the opposite to be honest.\n\nVisualsBeautiful and stunning. Those words come first to my mind.\nThe whole world just looks so beautiful and just makes you wanna continue playing just so you can see more of it. It’s a Metroidvania of another and modern Art but at the same time … It’s just a piece of art. I don’t know what else to say. The game does look like a Movie or rather a Painting come to life. Everything just fits. Everything. There’s not one bit you could point at and say that it doesn’t look good or fit into the game. You just can’t. The Art Style is wonderful, looks highly polished and … exceptional. Extraordinary.\nThanks to it’s beautiful Design I do feel like Children and Adults as well will be drawn to it.\nAt the same time I feel like Hayao Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli was a huge inspiration and influence to Moon Studios. The Visuals remind me just of some of the Ghibli Movies as well as not only the character but also the Background Design.\n\nAudioI know, I know … I repeat myself but the Soundtrack is stunning and perfect.\nThere’s no other way to describe it. You’ll immerse yourself into the World thanks to this beautiful Soundtrack. The soundtrack infused the game with raw emotion and life. Just listen to the soundtrack. I caught myself staying longer in a certain region of the world just so I could listen to the soundtrack while running around and exploring every last angle of the world.\nHarmony, peace, fear, hope, desperation, anticipation … those are just a few feelings I had when I listened to the Soundtrack. You have to listen to it. You owe it to yourself. The Soundtrack to Ori and the Blind Forest is one of the best in the industry.\n\n\nWhat else can I say about this wonderful game?Emotional. Perfect. Beautiful. Memorable.\nYou could use so many words to describe Ori and the Blind Forest but it all boils down to those four. You will care about the game. You want to find out more about the Story and Kuro. You won’t forget this game. Ever. I’m not gonna lie when I’m telling you here and now that Ori and the Blind Forest hit me deep in the feels. Two times folks … I got two times emotional while playing the game and I’m not ashamed to admit that. It’s just a sign to me that I did connect with the game on a certain level and that the folks over at Moon Studios managed to create a game that will do exactly this: Connect with the Player.\nI can honestly say this: I won’t forget this game nor the Characters. Be it Ori, Naru, Gumo or Kuro …\nI struggle for words if I’m completely honest. It’s rare that I connect with a game on such a level. Everything appeals to me. The Visual, the Audio, the Story, just everything.\nPersonally I’d say Ori the Blind Forest deserves a Game of the Year Award.\nWhat Moon Studios managed to pull of over the course of four years is an exceptionally stunning and memorable game.\nIt's worth every penny. In fact call me crazy but ... this game would actually deserve a 60 Bucks price tag. Not even kidding. The game might be fairly short but still if you take into consideration what you're getting for your money ... It's worth so much more trusty me on that.\nMy personal Game of the Year and it managed to become one of my favorite games.","June 28, 2015","true","28.5"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","30","34","0","5"

Although it's a very simple and basic storyline it'll hit you right in the feels from the very first minute again shining especially in the visual department.\n\nThe gameplay itself is basic metroidvania with a big interconnected map with lots of places to explore and resources to gather (that enhance your character either through the skill tree, health or mana upgrades). Enemy variety is alright, though not great either. They fit well into the world, even if they are rather generic and don't vary too much from level to level, but the interaction with your abilities that you'll unlock later (separate from your skill tree that enhances them further) adds another degree of gameplay on top of what you're getting used to, so it's unlikely that you'll get bored easily.\nI'm only roughly 3 hours in, but so far the (mini?-)bosses are a bit underwhelming. Games like Outland made them feel a lot more epic while in this game they seem to be very generic, small enemies that have more health than the regular ones and only slightly differ from the non-boss enemies.\n\nBut yeah, that's pretty much all my criticism right now. Despite the little flaws the developers behind this made a huge effort to craft a very well put together videogame that is absolutely worth it's 20$/20€ price tag, so my verdict is:\n\nBUY","March 10, 2015","true","10.8"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","30","36","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/recommended/261570/","slothyexistence","The Slothful Existentialist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/","953 products in account","Overview: Ori and the Blind Forest is an open-world, 2D, story-driven, action-adventure platformer with exploratory gameplay and entertaining combat; the game is visually outstanding as well as sonically masterful with an amazing soundtrack. It was developed by Moon Studios -a group consisting of talented developers spread out over Europe, the Middle East, Oceania, and North America- using the Unity engine. It’s published by Microsoft Studios. The game is currently available for Xbox One and PC. It's one of the best games I've ever played.\n\n\nStory: We’re thrown right into the narrative, as the Spirit Tree begins to tell the tale of how it ‘lost’ newborn spirit Ori to the forest of Nibel due to a storm. Ori, now orphaned, is raised by Naru, a benevolent bear-like creature. Later, a cataclysm leaves the forest in decay, and Naru passes away as a result. Orphaned once more and with his surrounding forest dying, Ori finds Sein, who is ‘the light and the eyes of the Spirit Tree’ and offers to guide Ori in his quest to restore the forest to its previous state: full of life and harmony. In his adventures Ori learns of the events that triggered the cataclysm, and faces several obstacles in his quest. Among them a long-limbed creature named Gumo, who becomes Ori’s ally after making his life a little difficult; a gigantic owl name Kuro, a creature of the darkness who attempts to prevent Ori from restoring light to the forest; and many enemies along the way from whom Ori has to defend himself.\n\nThe plot is filled with a wide range of emotions, from carefree bliss to hopeless depression, and includes anything in between: annoyance, humour, curiosity, confusion, kindness, etc... Moon Studios did a marvellous job of tugging at the appropriate heartstrings through various events, resulting in a highly captivating and internalized storytelling experience. Ori takes influence from animated films like The Lion King and The Iron Giant, both of which are coming-of-age stories; in turn, Ori also feels very much like a coming-of-age story. The narrative has a peculiar tone and style to it, it likes to use vague but guiding vocabulary, allowing the player to infer quite a bit and interpret the themes of the plot (kindness, sacrifice and parenthood). The characters are all wonderfully written; there isn’t any excess, and that (together with its incredible visuals) makes the world surrounding the player feel fluous and whimsical.\n\n\nGameplay:I cannot fail to mention the calibre of level design and game mechanics. The gameplay is some of the most fluid and well animated that I’ve had the pleasure to experience. This may be partly because I haven’t played too many games in the past year, or it might be simply because Moon Studios has some immensely skilled devs in their ranks. Ori has abilities and skills that he learns throughout the progression of the game, these skills are learned at the Ancestral Trees. The player can upgrade abilities by gaining experience through finding Ability Cells, or absorbing Spirit Light by defeating different kinds of enemies which have different types of attack mechanisms. There’s so much to do in the game: solve puzzles, defeat enemies, collect Energy Cells and Life Cells (more energy slots and life slots, respectively), use upgraded abilities to explore previously unavailable places, and ultimately restore the forest.\n\nFalling into the genre of ‘metroidvania’, the game definitely takes after classics like Metroid and Rayman, which directly influenced the gameplay of Ori. Ori is very much intended as a ‘love letter’ to those games. The map itself is one huge open world; there are no loading screens, just exploration through jumping, climbing, swinging, bashing, etc… It’s no Dark Souls, but if you do not save often this game is very unforgiving.\n\n\nGraphics:Writing about the visual aspect of this game is difficult, because I’m at such a loss for words, it is probably the prettiest 2D game I have ever seen. The animations are pure magic and the hand-painted assets and environments are what make the whole game’s atmosphere cohesive. Designers took inspiration from a few well-known works, such as Hayao Miyazaki’s Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and Disney’s The Lion King. The level “Valley of the Wind” is a straight-up tribute to Nausicaä. One of the things I think is the coolest about this game is that in the backgrounds there are no recycled assets; one of the two founders, Thomas Mahler, says: "You see this tree in the background and this mushroom and this rock? That's the one and only place you'll ever see those assets." I find this to be amazing because most games today tile their textures or re-use assets already used elsewhere in the game. Unique assets make the game’s environments feel as real, fresh, non-repetitive and original as they possibly can.\n\nOnto the character ‘Ori’, the star of the game. He’s this little creature, a mix between a dog, a cat, a rabbit and a monkey. He’s got a weird little design, but awesome nonetheless; Ori is one of the coolest animalistic characters I’ve had the chance to play as. From his jumping and running animations to the way he interacts with different mechanisms of the game, the character feels as alive as perceptively possible.\n\n\nSound:Sound is -a lot of the time- as important as the visuals in a video game. The audio of any given game is what gives life to the user experience, a game’s sound is what completes it, what makes you immerse yourself and just forget about whatever’s going through your head. Ori’s soundtrack by itself is serene and beautiful enough to make you disengage yourself from your surroundings. Give it a couple of hours and you’ll completely forget where you are, courtesy of composer Gareth Coker.\n\n“Wait, what? Four hours have passed already? What do you mean it’s 3am?” -Me. Sound is what makes that possible.\n\nThe audio design in this game is next to flawless. All the way from footsteps to the environment sounds, to the narration, the audio is simply mesmerizing. The atmosphere, the ambience that the sound manifests, it’s magnificently special.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts: I dove into this game with minimal knowledge about it, all I knew was that it was a very pretty and successful game. But there wasn’t much about it besides the seemingly amazing story and visuals that drew me in - until I read about the developers.\n\nDid you know Moon Studios doesn’t have a location? It’s an independant worldwide collaboration between many talented people all over the world, the two founders (Thomas Mahler & Gennadiy Korol) are veterans in their fields. Mahler previously worked at Blizzard on Starcraft 2 and Korol was Senior Graphics and Tools Engineer at Animation Lab (an Israeli feature-film animation studio). Among their employees Moon Studios has some extremely talented people.\n\nWhen I educated myself on who actually made the game, suddenly I felt like I had to play it. And boy was that a good decision! Choosing to play this game was a great call, it provided me with some of the most memorable moments I’ve had in recent gaming and got me out of a crippling writer’s block.\nThe fact that it was nominated for so many awards should tell you how well-made it is. And if not, the fact that it WON Best Art Direction among other awards should.\n\nThe game made me feel happy, sad, loved, alone, powerful, weak and a mixture of many other sentiments. It has become one of my all-time favourites, once I began playing I could not bring myself to stop; it’s challenging and frustrating but completely satisfying at the same time. I enjoyed every single second of it. In my humble opinion, this game is near-perfect.","March 28","true","15.9"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000420809/recommended/261570/","76561198000420809","Aulbath","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000420809/","608 products in account","The main reason I got interested in Ori was that Thomas Mahler (the main man behind the game) wrote a couple of interesting posts regarding gameplay, polish and "proper videogames" in one of the forums I frequent AND he also considers Link's Awakening to be one of the best classic Zeldas, just like I am - needless to say, I wanted to see what this guy can do. And he sure did a lot, Ori is definitely pretty looking and quite a decent game, too.\n\nI am not going to gush about the brilliant presentation, graphics, music and sound design are fantastic - Ori along with games like Guilty Gear Xrd are at the absolute top when it comes to stunning 2D visuals. If you are into beautifully realized 2D art, getting this game is a no-brainer. Soundtrack and storyline complement the graphics nicely, it is quite emotional and moving (maybe a tad clichéd) - perfect for young and old people alike.\n\nGameplay-wise it is a bit of a mixed bag (literally) - it is basically a Metroidvania-game, however some of the later platforming segments wouldn't feel too out of place in the earlier stages of Super Meat Boy, including many instant death-moments. Towards the end there is also more emphasis on puzzle platforming, pulling levers, gravity-fun and putting rocks into places to make certain tunnels passable. While these different styles of 2D platforming are okay-ish, I can't help but feel that these segments feel disjointed from the rest. Ori has a bit of a flow problem, the world (despite being very small compared to most other titles of it's kind) feels chopped up into these areas that are either "hardcore-platforming", "exploration" or "puzzle-rooms". Unfortunately, on their own these gameplay-elements are just okay. If you have played any number of (indie) platforming-games in the past five years, you will recognize most of the challenges and ideas. I would be totally okay with this, if the whole package would manage to pull it all together it one banging experience - but that isn't quite the case with Ori.\n\nThe Metroidvania-exploration lacks any meaningful / exciting items to find, in fact you only get energy- and hp-upgrades as the main reasons to actually explore the world. Sure, there are Ability Points to find as well - but these are even less exciting, as you can generate XP to get Ability Points through combat. Ability points can be traded for abilities (duh!) that I think should have been hidden in the world instead of adding a "skill tree". It just dillutes the whole point of exploring the world for no real gain in excitement or complexity. I imagine this was done because the world is so small and they couldn't cram all the abilities into the world, because you would basically trip over an upgrade every other screen - but still, the way they handled it is less than optimal, in my opinion.\n\n"Combat" is a complete joke. While knocking out enemies is kind of fun thanks to decent hit-feedback (sends enemies flying away and smashing into stuff) combat almost feels like an afterthought. You just run past stuff, spam your attack and collect XP. There are hardly any patterns or behaviours you need to learn or adapt to. The game also lacks any kind of actual boss encounters (meaning you won't go destroying multi-form boss monsters head on) - there is Kuro, but you never confront her directly. 2D games without massive bosses are a wasted opportunity.\n\nFinally, hitdetection and controls could have been better in places. The game is seemingly inconsistent about how much damage you take, how far or close you can  be in order to take damage and wether or not it insta-kills you. Pretty much all moves also have a bunch of startup-frames, making the game also feel less direct than I would have liked. AND I personally hate the double/triple jumping mechanic that is basically used in this game to cover ground on the x-axis NOT the y-axis which feels counter intuitive compared to most (japanese) games like this. It definitely doesn't control as tightly and precise as I would have hoped, in fact - it has a tendency to feel rather floaty at times. A game like Völgarr the Viking destroys Ori when it comes to absolute perfect movement, precision and ease of controls.\n\nWhat saves Ori as a game is the "bash" command that allows you to jump off from projectiles and enemies in mid-air, choosing the direction you wanna go. This, combined with lategame skills like charged walljumps and being able to float allows for some tricky and entertaining platforming-sections (crossing spike-covered chasms of death "riding" on enemy projectiles for example). I am decent at platformers, so I never found Ori too challenging (quite the opposite for the most part, especially due to picking up all those upgrades and abilities) - the sequences that most people seem to have issues with were not really hard for me. Those auto-scrolling segments are simplistic trial and error affairs that take a couple of tries to understand 'em / learn 'em but they did not throw me off at all. But I sure did loose a lot of lives with all that puzzle-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that doesn't make a lick of sense, like the gravity-crap in the Forlorn Ruins.\n\nIf the game had tighter, more direct controls I would even attempt the "no death"-run, but for now I am okay with having finished the game once, seeing 100% of all the maps and only having missed one upgrade and 3 secret areas.\n\nOverall, the game was fun while it lasted - a bunch of areas were rather annoying and the gameplay is not as convincing as I had hoped, putting emphasis on elements that I simply do not care about. Still, a lot of love and care has been poured into this game, and it shows. Just don't expect the actual game to be as amazing as the presentation, and you will be fine.","March 15, 2015","true","12.2"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","38","50","2","0"

If you are looking for a game with:\n\n-Great, gripping narrative\n-Great Gameplay\n-Great Soundtrack\n-Great visual/art style.\n-Great game all around\n\nThen this is YOUR game. If you are into platformers, this is a great game for you. This is not an EASY platformer either. In fact, once you beat the game and want to challenge yourself some more, there are some hard as hell achievements to go after which will no doubt keep you wanting to come back.\n\nThough Ori and the Blind Forest does not tell a story with a huge amount of dialect, it does not need to. The characters themselves are quick to identify with which I must give the developers an A+ for because within the first five minutes of the game at the end of the Prologue (which I recommend you do before playing the main story), I was crying. This game will pull at your heartstrings. This is a story that tells one of tragedy. The way the story is portrayed is beautiful. The soundtrack really sets the tone of it too. You will not just feel sad for Ori, you will feel sad for the other characters too, even the villainess.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough, this is by far, one of the BEST games I have ever played on Steam by far. My only, ONLY gripe with this game is that there are some areas which, once you complete you cannot return to if you wish to hunt for collectibles which means you cannot get 100% completion if you miss those collectibles. I hope the devs can somehow fix this. Asides from that though, this game deserves all the praise and recognition it has been receiving from the public. This is, A GREAT GAME.\n\nMy rating:\n9.5/10\n\nThe only reason it lost the 0.5 was due to the issue of some areas become closed off permanately so if you miss the collectibles, you miss out for good unless you replay the game from the beginning. But don't let that stop you from playing this game. It is great, a worthy addition to anyone's Steam Library or on any other platform this is available.","March 23, 2015","true","13.7"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","0"

The art style is so beautiful, the soundtrack absolutely amazing, and the story the game is telling very sweet and lovely.\nIt can be quite frustrating at some points (I ragequit the game very early on and didn't wanna play it for a week; only to then complete the rest of the game in one sitting), but it definitely gets easier the more you play - even though the game itself gets harder the further you progress. Usually I'm not a huge fan of platformers, but this game had me hooked instantly - for the above mentioned reasons.\n\nYou get to spend your skill points just as you like, and you can explore and revisit areas - despite mission goals - completely freely most of the time (with the exceptions of three areas that you can't revisit) once you learn the required moves to access them.\nThe controls are very easy and not complicated at all, though you can't remap them if you wanted to.\nAlso, some of the achievements are kinda bugged; it's not that you cannot get them though, it's that it's possible that they unlock at completely random times. For example, I randomly got six achievements at once at some point when I only should have gotten one.\n\nEven though I got quite mad at it at one point, I absolutely recommend the game because of its gorgeous art and story.","January 28","true","14.7"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","2"

They live a happy and content life together, searching for fruit to scoff in the forest. A catastrophic event changes all that, causing the trees to wither and die.

This game is not one of them. From start to finish I never experienced a dull moment. If not for the challenging enemies or puzzles, it's due to your own eagerness to discover new abilities to be learned, uncover the mystery behind the story or just to sit and gaze at the magnificent changes of scenery backed by a wonderfully composed music.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest is as beautiful in its emotional storytelling as it is in its gorgeous art and its gripping soundtrack.

The gameplay is flawless and there is tons of stuff to see in terms of art work. It is just beautiful to look at. With in the first few seconds of playing the game I was already blown away by how great it looks. I've seen videos of the game on websites and I thought it looked amazing then, but actually playing it in person is just in a whole new world.\n\nI have only played the game for about 40 minutes, but in that amount of time I just had to give my thoughts, GREAT GAME.  Nice change of pace from all the call of duty and assasins creed crap every year. We NEED more games like this.\n\nI have never been impacted with such emotions from playing a video game since playing Okami, and I have to say, that what games should be like. Not the 'Oh I just quick scoped a noob' in shooter games.\n\nI plan to get the xbox one also that way I have two copies of the game, even if I own a ps3. TRUE gamers don't care what console they play on, they just want to play the game. Playing this game is a prime example of that.\n\nThank you Moon studios, you really out did yourselves.\n\n\nEdit: Ok, now that I have beaten the time, I'm going to go into more depth of my review without spoiling any big parts of the story.\n\n\nGameplay:  As I said before the gameplay is nearly flawless and pretty much everything works the way it's made for. Some of the puzzles can be quite confusing at first but with a little thinking you can solve them. The game starts out easy, but as you progress and get more power ups and upgrades, the game gets alot harder. I mean A LOT harder. One example would be out climbing the flooding ginso tree they showed at gamescon. Sure it looked easy when they showed it, but when I tried it myself, I was kind of surprised at how tough it was, and it took me about 15 tries before I got it right. I'm not going to say whats going to happen to future escape sequences so I don't spoil you guys, but just a heads up, they get HARDER as you go. But when you finally beat them, it's very fulfilling. Timing is also a key factor in solving puzzles. One more recommendation, use PLENTY of soul links whenever you can. It gets very frustrating when you get far in a part of the game, only to die and go back like 20 minutes of game-play simply because you for got to make a check point. The health system in my opinion is kind of useless, as later on in the game enemy attacks and stage hazards are pretty much a instant death.\n\nSound and music: The sound affects and music are what make up a third of the game. Just like the story and the visuals make up the other two thirds.  Everything you do has a very unique sound to it such as branches and twigs sound like wood breaking and rocks sound like crumbling an so forth. Even down to when Ori emerges from the water, just the cute sound of him gasping for breath is amazing. Some of my favorite sounds would be the wind. Just the sound of the wind blowing through the leaves is outstanding. The music is very fitting for the situation. Slow and peaceful music in the bright open areas of the forest, while you get more suspenseful and intimidating music in a place that's more dark and secluded. You also get fast paced music for sequences that are more fast paced and each one is different so it feels like you just are truly in a different place, not just in terms of look, but in feel. The music is just great and I even bought the soundtrack to prove it.\n\nVisuals and graphics: This was the big eye catcher for most people, I'm no exception. The look of the game is very vibrant and clean. Even if it's a 2-D plat-former, the games background has some 3-d elements to it such as trees in the background, and rocks and water more close to the screen. Everywhere you go you will see something new and will never once see the same thing twice.\n( unless you're back tracking to a place you've already been.)  I really have nothing else to say about the graphics other then that it's great and goes along great with the music and sound.\n\nVerdict:  Ori and the blind forest is a Great action game that I recomennd to anyone. While I'm am a little disappointed that the game wasn't as long as the developers said it would be at around 10 hours, ( me about 5 ) it's still a great game regardless and at $20, you cant really complain, and the game does get frustrating at times but it always feels good when you get past whatever was giving you trouble.\n\n9/10\n\nEdit #2:  Ok, apparently this game has NO continued play. Meaning you can't go back and collect the rest of the upgrades and collectables. Once you finish the game in a save slot, that's it, done, it won't let you play that save file anymore, meaning you have to start a new game from scratch from a new save file or delete the one you just completed. While I don't mind playing the game a second time, and it might actually be funner since I know it better, it is still a disapointment that you cant go back and get the rest of the items and secrets.\n\n8 1/2 - 10.","March 10, 2015","true","12.4"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","28","39","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/recommended/261570/","bahderb","Bah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/","2492 products in account","I have no hesitation naming "Ori & The Blind Forest" an early contender for my personal game of the year. It's an excellent throwback to classic platforming gameplay mixed with AAA technology in the way of graphics, animation, and a startlingly fantastic soundtrack. All in all, I was simply blown away by my experience with this game and I can see myself playing it again over time like returning to a good book or film. The score will go down as a classic when all is said and done and reminded me of how I felt the first time I heard Uematsu's amazing Final Fantasy 7 score.\n\nWithout getting into the particulars of the story, it's a relatively timeless story of love with elements of nature and fantasy mixed in to provide the backbone. Ori is a very lovable avatar and the way the story is composed, Ori as a character will help entice you to keep playing.\n\nAccording to Steam, I have put 14 hours into this game at the time of this review. This is virtually all devoted to the main game. I did take some time to explore to seek out upgrades and such, but for the most part this time is due to the awesome challenge provided by the game's tight platforming mechanics, intriguing puzzles, and all around great atmosphere. I highly suggest you play this game with a gamepad.\n\nPros:\n+ Beautiful game technologically. Graphics, music, everything shines.\n+ Very challenging in spots. It's not the hardest platformer you'll ever play by any stretch, but the challenges are fun and rather than cause rage, make you want to succeed pulling something off.\n+ Charming story and characters. Even the "villain"!\n+ A game for anyone to enjoy. Young and old. If you enjoy platformers, this is a must-play.\n\nCons:\n- Replayability for some may be low. I think this is more of a YMMV scenario. I can see some finishing this game and moving on and never returning and I can see others wanting to master it, aim for speed-runs, and that sort of thing. It really depends on your appetite as a gamer for this genre of game.\n- The end portion is not as challenging as I assumed it was going to be in the lead-up. I can't call it a let down, but I think there was a missed opportunity to extend the end game.\n\nNeedless to say, I loved this game from the word go. It starts seemingly slow with exposition and setting up the "journey" you're about to take, but once the game gets going, it goes. The challenge ramps up as you go on and you'll be thankful after a hard slog of trial and error and have something laid back before diving into the next challenge.\n\nFantastic game and worth it at full price, but even better if you get it on sale!\n\nRating: 9/10","June 22, 2015","true","13.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

I played through the entire game trying to find one mistake that the developer made. Needless to say I found absolutely nothing wrong with this game at all. Ori and the blind forest was clearly created with love by the developers and every feature was considered and researched properly before being put into the game.\n\nStoryA very intriging story. Theres not much I can say about the story without spoiling it. What I will say is it is follows a family love between characters and is filled with moments that could make you cry or smile with delight. It is a rare game that can bring out these feelings in you and it is a truly beatiful story.\n\nGameplayAnyone who is a fan of platforming games will love this. What really suprised me though and I didn't expect it is that as well being focused on platforming it also has a large focus on combat. A great combat system at that. Very fun combat which leaves you having to run and jump about while fighting to avoid being hit. Also a large enemy variety that make you have to adapt to situations to fight different enemies. The combination of this combat system and hard platforming make Ori a very difficult game that could lead to raging moments. But boy is it satisfying when you finally kill that enemy or reach that platform you've been trying to get to for ages.\n\nUpgradesNow to keep the longevity of enjoyment of a game throughout playing there has to be a good upgrade system that evolves as you play. Ori does exactly that. What is unique though is that platforming elements that are usually in a game from the start are unlocked as you play. This includes abilities such as double jump and wall jump. It means that the game gets even more fun and difficult as you play. It is a strange choice to do this but I think it works very well in the circumstances of the game. What it means is that certain areas can't be accessed until you get these abilities. It makes for some artificial linearity to the game. These are abilities are unlocked as you play through the story.\n\nThere is also another upgrade system that you can control. As you play the game you get experience through killing enemies and finding hidden secrets. These earn you ability points that can be used to unlock upgrade in one of three different upgrade trees. These include things like upgrading your other earned abilities or giving your character new abilities to use. It is very flexible and all of the upgrades seem to make a noticeable difference to gameplay and aren't useless.\n\nSoundtrackOne of the best soundtracks I have heard in a game. Beatiful music artisticly crafted can manipulate your feelings. All of the music fits in perfectly with the situation. So sad scenes and high energy combat scenes all have the most appropriate music. The main menu soundtrack is absolutely incredible as well and is definitely something I wouldn't mind listening to again. There are so many unique tracks as well so you definitely won't get bored of listening to the same songs over and over. This soundtrack was definitely crafted with love and it definitely shows.\n\nGraphicsMan are these great. I thought trines graphics were something that couldn't be beaten and then I saw ori. This is something else. The whole game is beatiful and nothing seems out of place. They even put effort into the smallest of details like plants to make for a more complete and flawless experience. Never have I seen a game with such a consistent art style that is such a pleasure to look at.\n\nAnimationsThis was something of a suprise. Usually games neglect animations and go for pretty basic ones that do the job just well enough to work. Ori didn't follow this trend. The animations flow so well. Everthing that is needed to is animated on the game and everything is flawlessly great. This includes the main character (ori), plants and enemies. The fact that they put so much effort into making even the animations perfect really shows how lovingly this game was crafted. All animations are unique and fantastic.\n\nConclusionI can't recommend this game enough to anyone. if you are a fan of platformers then you will "LOVE" this game. It is definitely one of the greatest games I have ever played!\n\nTheIronicGamers rating systemDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!","July 31, 2015","true","12.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","3"

The gameplay is a balanced mix of platforming, puzzle solving and hunting for collectables. The soundtrack is enjoyable and adds to the sense of immersion a great deal. The story plays a critical role, and talking about its events in advance could severely damage your experience,\n\nUnfortunately, this game lacks replay value.

So you will be backtracking on the map to pick up different power upgrades that will help you to reach new areas.You also have three talent trees you can upgrade by gaining xp. These trees are for damage, utility/health and map upgrades. The story is simple but quite memorable.\n\nOri is a real joy to control, it's intuitive, precise and responsive. The level design is terrific, challenging the players's physical and mental dexterity. And it truly is challenging, I died over 200 times on my playthrough. I'm not exaggerating there's a death counter. Luckily you can place your own checkpoints so it's not very punishing. The challenge made the game very rewarding to play but also might scare away some players, which is a shame.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous, the art is beautiful and the colors are bright. Magnificent soundtrack makes the game even better. The music works especially well in the few escape sequences in the game, in which it encourages the player to continue even after failing without the feeling of frustration player death  might bring. It's not a very long game, 7-10 hours depending on how many hidden collectibles player is going for and the player's skill ofcourse. The value is balanced by a moderate price.\n\n[Score: 90]","December 28, 2015","true","10.1"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

Instantly, the game draws you into it's storyline with the compelling urge to keep pushing and progressing forward.\n\nThe gameplay has also proven to be a lot of fun and very addictive, I keep wanting to take a quick break but finding it increasingly difficult to turn away, there is so much to explore and just as much to collect. This game is also a very good example of a perks system that is done properly and proves to be well balanced. I have no faults with the gameplay at all, it's simply flawless.\n\nIn my case, I normally like to stick to a style of game that I know I will enjoy, Ori and the Blind Forest has taught me to break away from that habit and try branching out a little bit more as I find my self to be pleasantly surprised. Special thanks to my friend for recommending this to me from her Steam library.

Every aspect of it.\nThe artwork is incredible. Just look at the screenshots.\nThe soundtrack is simply brilliant, the sort you can listen to for hours.\nThe story can bring a tear to the eye in the first ten minutes.\nIf you don't think games can be art, Ori and the Blind Forest is my rebuttal.\n\nMoving swiftly from aesthetics to gameplay, the game is difficult. VERY difficult. It starts out simple enough, but soon teaches you that any mistake can be your last, with a vast amount of enemies who will not hesitate to crush, shoot, spike, ram, and generally injure you in any way they can. Still, despite the diversity in the opponent's ranks, Ori is far from helpless. With the help of a little ball of light named "Sein", Ori can shoot enemies, charge for a powerful explosive blast, leap from wall to wall, and through enemies, even redirect the opponents attacks them!\n\nas you progress through the game, you will increase your health, your energy pool, and can spend ability points to make yourself stronger. You can make your attacks hit multiple targets, shoot faster, deal more damage, that sort of thing. You can make health and experience orbs fly toward you (TAKE THAT. IT MAKES EVERYTHING EASIER), or you can make your abilities more useful, by way of healing you when you use them, or simply being cheaper.\n\nThe game feels very quick-paced, and the movement feels very fluid, and natural, making for an exiting, very enjoyable gaming experience.\n\n\nIf I had one complaint, it would probably be the controls for the "bash" ability. I find that it can sometimes be a little awkward to aim, often sending me in the wrong direction, that said, I can be rather clumsy, and I am new to the game, so I am fairly certain I will get the hang of it with time.\n\nAnyway, drawing this review to a conclusion, this game is a visual masterpiece, has an amazing soundtrack, and is a game I would recomend it to anyone, so long as you don't mind a challenge.\n\nat the time of writing this review, 97% of the reviews are positive, and the developers definitely earned it.","March 13, 2015","true","22.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

Go buy this game immediately!\n\nI wan't to state right away, that this is probably the best game I have ever had at my disposal. Everything from the music, to the gameplay, to the story. Is all done to the point of perfection.\n\nMusicThe music in this game is a very big contender, to be the very best game soundtrack I have ever heard! The soundtrack is this very beautiful atmospheric music, that mostly relies on piano music with some interesting sound effects to top it. They made good use of the different soundtracks absolutely perfect! All the soundtracks in the game, is played at the very perfect time and place in the game, which ultimately helps you get a very immersive experience. That is not to say that it is only calm nice music, cause that is certainly not the case! The moment that really shines is when you have restored the water element. That leads to a sequence where you have to make your way to the top of a cave like thing, while crystal blue water is rising and splashing all around you. Now you would probably think there is some sort of action music here to raise intensity, but that is not the case in Ori. Instead of neither a calm piano soundtrack or an intense action like soundtrack. We get this outstanding adventure emtional like music, that fits so well with the circumstances. It's so that you could almost shred a tear :,)\n\nSound EffectsIf you were to play this game, which you totally should. Do yourself a favor and get a nice pair of headsets, cause the sounds of this world will blow you away! Every little sound you here in the forest is so perfect! I mean it all sounds so organic and convincing. If we were to give sound effects forms and figures. Ori's sound effects are really nice and firm, rather than sound effects from games like... Yeay from nearly every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game out there! Take my word for it, you are gonna love it!\n\nGameplayThe gameplay in Ori is among some of the most fun I've ever had in a platformer. The gameplay is fluid and dynamic and constantly evolves the further you get into the game. Along the path on your adventure you'll come across several spirit like trees, which rewards you with different powers that'll help you surpass areas that was previously impossible to progress through. Now I don't wanna spoil what kind of powers you get, cause they are actually pretty damn cool, so I think you should find out yourself. But do know this... They are fun as hell!\nIf we have to take a look at the aspect of the world of Ori itself (Gameplay wise) It's a game that rewards you for exploration and finding hidden paths and sercrets. There is alot to go around when it comes to the world Ori, but one thing I should probably state is. This game is not easy! Trust me! I died 400 times before I finished the game. But the good thing about Ori is, that you never really get angry or annoyed from dying. Neither feeling it's unfair and simply way too hard. When you do die, you know what you did wrong for the most part and you never see it as an impossible task that you'll be stuck at for an hour. It's hard but fair. One last thing to mention is the save/checkpoint system. Now this is an interesting one. In Ori you have some mana like energy that can be restored by defeating some enemies aswell as destroying blue crystals. This mana energy thing is used to commence some powers, where one of those powers are checkpoints. You can place these anywhere, with some few exceptions. When you die, you spawn at your last placed checkpoint no matter how far back it were! So remember to place these frequently.\n\nVisualsOri and the blind forest is by far the most beautiful game I've ever gazed my eyes upon! The art style of this game is beyond fantastic. The color saturation is so prefect in every area of the game and it is by far the most immersive game world I've ever been in. You constantly have the urge to progress, just to see what gorgeous new area that awaits you! This is also one of the things that makes exploration in Ori so fun. There isn't really much else to say about the visuals of Ori, other than it's done to perfection!\n\nStoryNow the story of Ori is good, but isn't really FANTASTIC. It's been heard before, looking from the bigger perspective. I won't go into details here, since I think it's should be experienced first hand. But I can tell you this much, 10 min. after the game had started I nearly cried. Holy ♥♥♥♥, is the love in this game strong! The intro sequence of Ori is the most heartbreaking moment I've ever experienced in a video game. Like I said before, the story isn't really too original, but somehow they manage to make it feel original and fresh! It's definitely an interesting story to check out.\n\nNow as you have probably figured out so far. I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game! I love it so much that it has become my all time favorite video game! This game hit me somewhere in my gamer hearth, I never thought a game could. In all honesty, I can't come up with any cons of Ori and the blind forest. This game is the very first game I've tried, that deserves the title "Perfect" And I don't care if you are not into the platform genre, do yourself a favor and try the game out anyway. You won't regret it!","March 24, 2015","true","9.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

I have not had this much fun in a single-player platformer game in a long time. While the story is very simple and generic, the execution through all the other factors of this game molds one of the most cohesive experiences in a single-player game. 8/10 on the story.\n\nI have not tried the keyboard controls, but I can say in great certainty that the controller button mapping is excellent; though, it would be nice if there was a feature to customize controls. The handling of Ori in the game is very fluid and smooth; Ori is a very flexible and acrobatic character and is able to maneuver gracefully through the entirety of the map. I personally had no serious trouble with the handling and controlling of Ori, and despite having felt cheated on certain portions of the game due to the controls, I look back at that and realize that it's not because of the controls; the game places an emphasis on replayability and challenge. 9/10 on the controls.\n\nThe difficulty of this game depends on the player's skill. You will die a lot die a lot when you first play this game. If you're great with platformers, this game will not feel as difficult; if you're new or not that as skilled in this genre, you're going to feel like this is the hardest game ever made. All the enemies and environmental hazards still feel like a threat even when you have upgraded Ori's HP and skill tree; environmental hazards will deal the most damage to Ori. After overcoming the obstacles in this game, you feel like you've accomplished a challenging task; it's quite a satisfying experience. 9/10 on the difficulty and gameplay.\n\nLastly, the graphics and the sound/music are amazing in this game. Before writing this review, I was questioning myself if I should review the graphics and the sound/music in different categories. However, I find that this game has created a very cohesive experience with the graphics and the audio. Hearing the soundtrack is like listening to the story of Ori play out. Looking at the graphics of the game gives you the imagination of what the music is like. The content of them both are so well intertwined; the experience created from it is one of perfected beauty. I cannot say anything that is con of the graphics nor can I say anything negative of the sound and music. Gareth Coker did an amazing job on the soundtrack. Play this game and you can see and hear for yourself how a story plays out. 10/10 perfection on the graphics and sound/music.\n\nOverall, this game gets a 9/10 from me, but an extremely close 10/10. This game is near perfection and one of the highlights of this year. Buy this game and play it. You will not regret it.","April 7, 2015","true","22.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

You have to be quicker and more fluid to succeed and as you progress you'll start to feel the actions become natural to solving puzzles.\n\nOverall, if you watch the trailer and think "Can the game truly match this awesomeness?" then do yourself a favour and play it.

You don't need me telling you that.\n\nRather, I'd like to use this space to point out some of the issues I had. Note again, the game is still great, but man oh man, these few points just frustrated me to no end. I hope if the developers make a sequel they could work on a few of these points. Damn I sure want them to because this game is so beautiful,\n\n\nMy main issue? The story falls apart so completely in the end. It completely undermines everything I did in the game and left me feeling very unsatisfied, almost angry, when the credits rolled.\n\nA few other, more minor points\n- The difficulty curve is just... I don't know, odd. Most of the game will bore hardcore players, while the first gauntlet will crush casual players. Not to mention that it just strangely gets easier and easier as the game progresses, with more and more saves available to you and enough health to just tank through everything.\n- Powerups can be hidden in parts of the game YOU CAN NEVER RETURN TO!\n- Too many redundant abilities. Why do we need wall jump and wall run? The latter seems to exist entirely so we have FOUR different kinds of charge/dash abilities, and they all use different inputs! There is something to be said for games that can be challenging without overcomplicating their mechanics.\n- Just a little too short. Really, it feels like this game needs about an extra 30%, maybe one more area and temple.\n- When I got the breathe underwater power, I realized I already had finished basically the only underwater section, so I wouldn't have minded they expand on that area especially.\n\nAgain, I'd actually recommend this game because it's just so beautiful, with 2D art even better than the Rayman games in my opinion. The gameplay is fun, and the world is colourful.\n\nI can't believe I am saying this, but if they had cut out the story, I would have loved this game so much more.","June 20, 2015","false","7.3"," 376 of 687 people (55%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","55","376","687","30","36"

The intro was compelling and jerks on your heart strings. The ability, health, and mana system is easy to get the hang of, and balanced in coordination to the length of the game and more rewarding to how much you explore off the straight path, so to speak.\nThe characters are great, the map is a great size and fun to back track and explore. The scenery and music is top notch, and the amount of thought put into the design of the game is like no other I've played. The highs and lows of this game are very notable.

This is a deeply emotional, and immerssive game. The story telling may be short in nature, but the theme is meaningful and deep. And wether you like it or not, it will punch you right in the feels within the first ten minutes of the game. I don't know how they managed to make you love two characters so much so fast, but The feel-trip is real!\n\nPros:\nGameplay is fun, challenging and alluring. They introduce new abilities evenly through out the game as they add new puzzle sequences. They always have a new trick up their sleeve to keep you entranced, and wanting to play more, just to see what's in store.\nThe controls are solid, making it easy to use abilities and maneuver through the levels. Though I highly recommend playing with a controller.\nThere are no "real" boss fights in this game however, not a problem, as challenging escape sequences will leave you feeling a great sense of accomplishment once you finally beat them, basically replacing the need for bosses.\nEpic and deeply emotional soundtrack, layered ontop of the deeply emotional character development, will leave you in tears if you have a soul.\nThe graphics are a beautiful work of art. Not the most important part of a game, but in this game the graphics are definitely a spectacle to behold.\nThe game has replayability, there's no way you could get all of the achievments in one play through. Your going to want to have multiple saves if your a completionist, and an achievment hunter like me.\nCons:\nNo new game plus mode. This is not a real con, just a nit-pick. Although the game still has it's replayability.\nNo official Ori plushies yet!\nThis game has no real cons just get the game already.\nConclusion: 10/10 will play again and again.","June 18, 2015","true","13.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","1"

You do not want to miss this experience!\n\n~Warning~ I have not yet beat the game yet but I'm about 60% complete as the writing of this review, if my opinion changes I will update this!\n\nGraphics - 9/10\nThe graphics are almost perfect, every environment is beautifully stunning and you can't help but stare at it and just think how amazing it looks mid game. There is a negative to this though, it is so vibrant that in a few areas of the game you will lose your character and it can kill you.\n\nAudio - 9.5/10\nAbsolutely beautiful music too, it fits the theme almost perfectly. Also the game sounds were really good to, but I feel there should have been more ambient noise, not a big gripe though.\n\nGameplay - 8.5/10\nYou guessed it, just like the rest of the game the gameplay is amazing! The platforming feels tight and responsive and is pretty challenging at times. The biggest downfall for me are the bosses, oh and how many times you have to press space (my thumb was getting pretty tired......lol). The bosses were really fun to fight and what you had to do to beat them was creative but the axtual bosses themselves were easy and not as creative. The real boss fights in this game is some of the platforming challenges. Also I will mention that the game has a lot of things for you to collect, so this game does have a decent amount of replayability. Oh and I'm just going to throw this in here, this game is quite challenging I personally like challenging games but you might not.\n\nOverall - 9.2/10\nThis game is fantastic, that's all there is to it. I HIGHLY recommend you pick it up and give it a good shot, it is full of emotions and a pretty good story mixed in with amazing graphics, audio, and gameplay and you have yourself a game that is rare to come by these days. It has very few minor issues but nothing too big, one of my biggest personal issues is it doesn't come with the option of borderless fullscreen (and it switches to windowed if you try to alt-tab while in fullscreen). Gameplay wise again I'd of liked to see better bosses and that's about it.

Even at the start I almost hated it for some reason. I am very very used to platformers with this great art style and these oh so heartwrenching stories that don't actually have any gameplay in them so I was pretty critical with it, but I kept going with it.\n\nIt's actually a really good platformer. You get so much mobility that it is just really fun to jump around from place to place. In most Metroidvania whatever-games, I get pretty bored having to go back and forth from one area to the next. In this game you'll get triple jumps, air dashes, slow falls, fast falls, etc and getting to the next area is actually pretty fun. Just speeding through and jumping around past everything is great. There's even quite a few sections I could get to that I wasn't supposed to yet just by using all the mechanics. It feels pretty good to have so much control over your character, and it actually gets fairly challenging, tho there is a bit of trial and error in some sections it is not overly much.\n\nThe combat is pretty stale and is one of the reasons i disliked it at the start. But once you start getting your mobility skills you really don't have to bother with it at all and can start jumping and rushing past everything. The art style is really pretty but at times it can make it easy to lose your character on the screen and sometimes hard to see the projectiles with all the shinyness.\n\nThis is a good platformer. It isn't perfect and it is pretty short (not that short), but it looks nice and plays nice and has good music. It is something any platformer fan should try especially if you like double jumps and all that jazz.","June 24, 2015","true","5.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","3"

The main character, Ori is just so cute too!\nAs far as the gameplay is concerned, I think it is similar in style to the Metroid series, which is perhaps one of my most favorite series of games. Basically you start out with not much, then get new powers which allow you to do more things and explore new areas of the map. You progress through four (I think) major areas before the game ends. You can also earn Ability points which allow you to activate special upgrades such as more powerful firepower and say, breathing underwater, as a couple examples. Sometimes the game can be quite frustrating because sometimes timing everything perfectly and such (for quite a length of time at some parts) can be fairly difficult...but in all honesty a game should be challenging, and it's good that Ori is to a larger degree than many games nowadays.\nAs far as the story, for the most part it's told while you're playing (I think there's only a few cutscenes total) and the prologue segment had me in tears after the first five minutes (which is hard to do, actually). I don't want to spoil any of the story or anything (if it matters to anyone) so all I will say is it's probably not /the best/ or anything, but I have found it quite enjoyable thus far.\nI totally recommend it to anyone who likes oldschoolish platformers and/or want a game that is just in general very enjoyable and lovely to experience. Definitely a $20 well spent, in my opinion (for me, anyway). =w=\n\nTL/DR: 10/10 everyone needs to play this!!\n\n(May edit again once I've finished the game. :P )","March 10, 2015","true","15.5"," 32 of 53 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","32","53","3","5"

At this point. You'll know if that is a type of game that interests you or not. However, I must say up front even if you hate Metroidvania games. You'll miss out on something real special here.\n\nWhat I loved\nWhere to start.. The visuals are absolutely fantastic. From the art style and direction to the quality level design. To the subtle animations making every jump and action feel relatively unique and as though Ori may well be in very real danger.\n\nThe progression. This game isn't easy. Long, very technical platforming sections requiring precise timing reliant on enemy position and sometimes even crowd control. You won't do this on your first try, or your second. You'll need to be patient. A comparison to Dark Souls is easy but its apt. You need to take deliberate actions and commit to succeed. Early on you don't have many abilities. But by the time you find them all. Traversing the environment becomes a truly joyful experience.  Ori is so incredibly spry. The character feels as organic as the forest. And your movement along with it.\n\nThis soundtrack though.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBVMUOmQLcM\n\nAbsolutely incredible and emotionally jarring. Proper recurring themes. Truly great music. Additionally the sound design is top notch. I went out of my way to get into a quiet place grab a pair of great headphones and let the game envelope me. I recommend you do the same.\n\nWhat could have been better\nI have one caveat. Once the final objective is completed. You are locked out of accessing your save. I had heard rumors of such madness so, I spent a good while exploring until my heart was content. I highly suggest you explore before finishing.\n\nThe Gist\nThis is a truly rewarding experience. One I will not forget for a long time. If ever.

My Nvidia Optimus video card was running on auto setting and so we changed the setting after I had finished the game. If we had know this to start with, the game would have played much better, not sure why the controller played up. But I played the game again over the weekend and everything was behaving as it should. I will play the game more and try earn some final achievements then put the game to a close.\n\nLook if your a fan of platform puzzlers with a wonderful story to go with it, then Ori and the Blind Forest fits this description extremely well. Some people may not like these types of games, and that is fair enough. But I do love these type story platformers, even though I'm not the best at them. I will give the game a run for my money and enjoy doing so, as long as my issues with the game are resolved, and they are now :)\n\nBut one thing I dont agree with about this game is that Third Party Utility thats avaliable, this is suppose to help people stuck in walls and get back into areas that lock you out. I did not need this, nor will I contemplate using it. So all I can tell you is with out giving you spoilers, is this is a wonderful game. I did not need to use this Third Party Utility at all, so to me it is not really necessary. Just make sure  you save your game, and do it very wisely. I copied and pasted my save many  times so I could go back and explore in areas that I  have missed. But there is 3 areas that will lock you out, and you cant go back to them. Also once you complete the game, you will have to start a new one, unless you have previous saves available. I had found 39/42 secrets on my previous game that was finished, and    now my counter starts all over again for the achievement, but I will seek the secrets out and replay for them, just for fun :)\n\nThis game may not be for everyone, and everyone has a right to thier opinion.\n\nMY ORIGINAL REVIEW :\n\nOri and the Blind Forest is a lovely game with a heart whelming story, but not for the faint hearted, I had many issues. One mainly playing in slow motion on and off, but I persisted. When the game behaved I was enjoying it, but when it was laggy and slow nothing we did helped. There was a file missing as I checked the game cache and that downloaded and all seemed fine. Then there was another update later which made my issue return, sometimes It would play normal and other times slow and laggy, this was very frustrating to say the least. Also my Xbox controller had issues not always responding as they should, and my controller works fine. How do I know, because it plays great on other games with no issues, just this game seems to change back to keyboard and mouse while in game. I have had crashing issues with the last part of the game and again slow motion, my son changed some settings and so got me through the last part in small window mode, I owe him big time for this, but again it was lagging but not as bad even he got mad and he is a good gamer. But I did the rest of the game myself, even putting up with the issues, and why not I payed full price for the game, I was not going to throw in the towel because of game bugs. But I persisted, with my son's help at the very end.\n\nLook this game really is a lovely game and I will call it my little gem, but it was frustating playing it in slow motion for many hours, but I must say it did behave about half of the game play time. So when the game behaved I played the life out of it, into the early hours, till next the time then It had lagging and slow motion issues again. So this tells me its not my computer with issues its the game itself, it has some miner bugs that need adressing in my personal opinion. Im not a computer wiz, so tell me I have no idea, and yes you are right I dont, but I know what I have experianced in this game, and a good part of these issues did not make it fun, but rather infuriating that I just want to throw the controller and computer, I did not do this, I took breaks and also closed the game.\n\nLook if your dont agree or hate my review pending my personal experiance then thumb me down I dont really care. But I had to be honest and get this out to you and anyone else that reads this. Make dam sure you have the ablsolute right specs for the game, I know mine are fine my IT son told me they are, so I believe him and the game did behave about half my game time. I got through and finished it with help of course, from my son in the last part.\n\nLook to be honest this game is really lovely, very challenging and tough at times yes, it may not be for the faint hearted,  and I loved this game. But the issues are my reasons for the thumbs down.\n\nMy advise if you are intrested in the game and are curious, wait for a good sale and find out for yourselfs. But just make sure, as I said earlier that your computer can handle the game, mine did but struggled.\n\nI have a 1 and a half year old laptop with an Intel core i7-4700MQ CPU, a NIVIDA OPTIMUS GT740M graphics card, but still this should not be the issue here, I also have Windows 8.1 and 8 gig of memory. While I dont understand such specs, I do know that this laptop can play the game smoothly with out issues but the game behaved badly at the best of times and I pursued and persisted with it no matter what. Also my graphics card setting was set to auto, son changed this today, but even still I dont think this would have helped much, as now I have finished the game. I might go back and play again to see if its improved the performance, and maybe I can enjoy it better.\n\nThankyou for reading and rating my review, how ever you see fit. I finished the game I struggled with it, I fell in love with it. But I also cant recomend given my game play issues. When these things are fixed then sure its a wonderful game, and if you love puzzle platformers then this is a really good one, but only when it behaves.\n\nIm very sorry for giving this a thumbs down, it really saddens me, because this is a lovely game if your computer can handle it and there are no bugs and issues. Look just believe me, what I say, other people dont have these issues but I did, so thats why I rated down. There are a lot of Ori fans out there and I am one of them, but the game behaved badly at the best of times for me so I have to warn you and let you know this. But the story is beautiful and in my opinion well written and not to mention the awesome music aswell. Goodluck with the choice you make with my review and getting the game.\n\nThankyou for taking the time to read this review :)","March 23, 2015","true","54.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","25"

This is by far the most beautiful game I've ever played yet. The attention to detail is captivating, especially in motion. The environment surrounding you reacts to your every move, and the background parallax effect is breathtaking. Even just moving and jumping around is pure joy, thanks to the smooth and responsive character animations. The music is absolutely wonderful and fits the mood of the game at all times. The sound design is impeccable; I got chills every time I learned a new ability. The story is somewhat simple, yet very touching and memorable, and the execution is remarkable. It really pulls you in and motivates you to save the forest.\n\n- Gameplay -\n\nOri and the Blind Forest is a metroidvania game, which means you progressively unlock new abilities that allow you to go to places you couldn't reach or access before. Backtracking never felt tedious to me in this game, because it's mostly up to you as a player. You don't have to go back and collect all the secrets and uncover the whole map, but doing so is extremely satisfying.\n\nWhat I especially adore about the game's flow is the absence of hand-holding. This is a game that respects your intelligence as a player and your ability to figure things out on your own. The game may guide you subtly, but it never explicitly tells you what you need to do. Instead, it uses clever level design to introduce new gameplay mechanics to you. It all feels very instinctive and natural.\n\nThere's a simple but very welcome level-up system, with 3 perk trees that gradually improve your character's current abilities in a different way or add convenient info to your map. You get XP orbs every time you kill an enemy, and some bigger XP orbs are hidden in secret locations, so this gives you another incentive to kill enemies and explore the map. Plus, it improves the sense of progression and gives you that nice RPG feel of choosing what perk tree you level up first.\n\nHeck, even the saving system is cool and exciting. The game doesn't save automatically for you; you have to do it manually by lighting a kindle. This can cause some really intense moments, and it punishes players for being too reckless.\n\nThe difficulty curve is also perfect; the whole game offers a solid challenge, but if you remember to save often, it's quite forgiving. Though, If this game is giving you a rough time, you should try collecting as many life, energy and ability orbs as possible before going to your next objective. These orbs aren't just fun to collect, they help you more than you might think!\n\nBy the way, this game has no loadings, so the fun never stops and the sense of immersion is never interrupted.\n\nI believe this is gaming at its finest. A masterpiece in game design.\n★★★★★\n\n\n- Personal stats -\nFirst playthrough: 8 hours, 25 minutes.\nSecond playthrough: 5 hours, 45 minutes. Map 100% discovered. All life & energy orbs found.

Finishing these sections brought me no feeling of accomplishment, but only relief that it was over. It feels like sloppy game design, and really breaks up the pacing of what could have easily been one of the best games ever in this genre.\n\nAside from these sections which unfortunately bring the whole game down a notch, Ori is a fantastic game. The art style, the quality of the visuals, and the fantastic score have been discussed to death already, but Ori does many more things right too. It takes what would normally be a cookie cutter story and brings it to vivid, emotional life via stunning in-engine cutscenes that really show off how incredibly animated the game is. Controlling Ori is a joy, as she moves exactly as you'd expect her character to move and her increasing arsenal of skills are a pleasue to master and utilize. Unlike other games in this genre that are often more about combat, Ori's main hook is related to platforming and movement, and this is what makes up the bulk of the game's satisfying learning curve and challenge. Exploring the game's lush, breathing world is a delight.\n\nOri is an easy recommendation for gamers who have both competent 2D platforming skills and a certain level of patience.","March 22, 2015","true","19.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

This game is almost perfectly what you would get if you combined all my likes and mixed them into a 2-D platformer metroidvania.\n\nThe aesthetic is a wonder to behold, and the graphics do an amazing job of capturing the look of an expansive forest with gorgeous, wet realism with just enough cartoonishness to give it a look that's practically unique. The one thing you'll want to keep in mind though, do not turn off motion blur, it'll permanently blur the sides of the screen until you turn it back on again. I have no idea why, but it means you won't be able to see the gorgeous scenery in those areas, and with this game's graphics, you will truly be missing out.\n\nThe story gets deviously dark, but it never goes too far, and it's told almost entirely through the animation and the characters' actions, which you will be contributing to during the course of the game. Sadness, joy, fear, wonder, humility, empathy, triumph, and unadulterated enjoyment all make appearances, giving the entire game a wonderful roundedness to the emotional experiences it imparts.\n\nThe gameplay only enforces the story; as so much of it is told through the characters' actions, the tools you're given for making your way through the game shed light on the main characters' motives: to heal, explore, and to navigate the gorgeous temples. Unlike, say, guacamelee, where nearly all the upgrades the main character receives are fighting moves that just so happen to allow entry into new locations, Ori's upgrades are, with few exceptions, entirely travel-based that just so happen to have a combat use too. It's not a small touch, and it makes the main character feel like an evasive acrobat rather than an unstoppable badass, which is very refreshing.\n\nThe map is actually useful, which is a great relief, and the collectables are just numerous enough to tantalize the average player willing to do some exploration without feeling like you have to be an insane person to get them all. In fact, there may be a few too little, but it still strikes a good balance. What is unfortunate, however, is that some are missable, as you cannot keep searching or return to the temples after activating the objectives at the end of them.\n\nOne thing that this game does that is quite unique is that being able to save is a core mechanic in of itself, even hinted at near the beginning as integrated into the story. To save costs energy, a resource that does not recharge. When you save, you create a save point that you return to instantly on defeat. This makes an interesting dilemma: reduce iteration time by using up energy, or risk having to do more over again to save energy? It does not take long for energy to become common enough that this is no longer a factor though, so don't be put off--its sparseness early on only serves to really make it feel as though the main character is improving by the time you reach that point in the game.\n\nEither way, it matters little: this game has a wonderfully low iteration time that you can even control yourself no matter how you slice it, and doesn't berate you even if it takes a few dozen tries to get past an area, unlike games such as Fly'n. In addition, the controls are fluid and responsive and wonderfully natural when using a controller, and there are very few instances in the game that are challenging beyond enjoyment--I can't even remember any offhand. It never holds your hand either, though, a trap that some games fall into. You will have to figure things out yourself, but you are given everything you need to do so.\n\nSome people might be put off by the easiness, but I don't think this applies to many people. When you are in a difficult area you are challenged to be at your best, and when you are not, the aesthetics of the game, fluid controls, and feelings of freedom at bounding and weaving through paths and enemies will more than carry it. Keeping in mind that no game is perfect, I would absolutely give this game a 10/10 in nearly a heartbeat.\n\n\nIt also helps that Ori is cuter than a button. I mean my god, seriously.","March 27, 2015","true","17.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","9","11","3","0"

It is incredibly bright and vibrant, with a wonderful color palette. The characters are honestly downright adorable. From a technical standpoint, I played through the entirety of the game without more than a few moments of reduced frame rate, and there were no bugs that I took notice to.\n\nThe storytelling is incredibly well executed and it isn't mucked up by being strung out for too long either. I smiled, I cried, I felt emotions, and I'm sure you will as well. I can't speak for others, but I bonded with Ori more than just a little bit from our adventures through the Blind Forest.\n\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, Ori is pretty much flawless as well. This is hard for me to say considering there were more than a few aggravating platformer moments. There was a lot of fluctuation in difficulty level. There are certain points where you get the gist of what to do and nail it, but there are also parts where you will try time and again and still not understand fully how to progress past a certain obstacle. Thankfully, there is a handy save-anywhere (anywhere safe) feature, so long as Ori has the energy to do it. That being said, there are portions where you are in panic mode and will have to complete a series of platforming puzzles in succession without being able to obtain a checkpoint, so be prepared for that.\n\nOverall, the only downside I really noticed that is even slightly worth noting is that there are one or two areas where you cannot return once you've completed them, making completion less likely if you happen to miss something. This is of course an incredibly minor inconvience, and I strongly advise that this doesn't deter you from playing this game.","April 4, 2015","true","18.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/261570/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","Ori started as one of the most frustrating games I've played in recent memory, and contains a heap of annoyances and problems that are very worth pointing out. Despite all that, given enough time and care Ori and the Blind Forest will slowly open up into a challenging, rewarding, beautiful and most of all fun metroidvania style puzzle platformer.\n\nHighlights\nThe understated whimsical graphics and art style in this title go together with the story like cheese and toast, and while there are some instances of graphical artefacts confusing and disorientating your gameplay, for the vast majority of the game they're not overdone and bring the story, pacing and world alive and make it a joy to travel through.\nThe story itself is also worth highlighting. It feels rich and alive enough to connect with you, but isn't overdone at all and as such you wont feel like you need to pay attention and you can happily focus purely on the gameplay, and the impact is soft yet strong, much like a well made children's story such as the Lion King.\n\nThe soundtrack and orchestral music composition deserves a special mention. It's a rare thing to see good fitting backing tracks these days and they clearly chose the right studio. The soundtrack contains 32 tracks, or 90+ minutes of songs and is available on the store page and is a worthwhile buy if you're into that.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nOh boy. Normally I'll select 1 or 2 of the development choices or problems with a title and touch on how they affect gameplay for this section, and with Ori and the Blind Forest there are many to choose from, but they all fall from the same cause: strange mechanical choices with narrow implementation. What this means is that for the most part the issues affecting and annoying the player are because of so many overlapping gameplay designs, but while the time and care was taken to make sure the entirety of the game works with those mechanics in the game Outland for example, Ori just doesn't have enough time and polish to make everything work together all the time and you're inevitably left with lots and lots of repeatedly frustrating gameplay moments.\n\nThe save-point system, called the Soul-Link, is the best example of this. It's been implemented to help the story and gameplay move more smoothly instead of forcing the player to constantly seek out save points while keeping the challenge alive, and at best it forces you to think about whether you'd like to spend your energy to save, or take a risk and blast ahead with a challenging section. In practice however it's just a frustrating mess more times than\n\nnot, and even with careful energy usage you'll wish you could move it forward just a little more each time so you don't have to replay the same cut scene every time you die. This is doubled in annoyance by the fact that many of the maps and sections are completely unpredictable the first couple of times you play through them, meaning you could be forced to watch the same cut scene or dialogue sequence 7 or 8 times, then repeat the same section of gameplay 7 or 8\n\ntimes, just to get to the point you died at previously and learn the next sequence. It's a difficult thing to balance correctly and at times, especially early when gameplay is simpler, it works very well, but ultimately unless you've taken the time to fully upgrade and explore every inch of every section you're probably going to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off a lot because of poor mechanical design.\n\nIn a similar game, Outland, there's a fantastic first level which teaches you, with on screen prompts and gameplay, how the controls work and how to use them efficiently. In Ori, the same prompts are missing or at best rushed and for the first map you're going to die simply because you don't know what you can do yet. When coupled with the abundance of legends on the map screens, the multiple sets of controls and lack of overlay, the controls and explanations are a steep learning curve fraught with annoyance. There's also a big separation between playing on a controller and a keyboard, especially early on when you're still learning and it feels unfair and frustrating.\n\nRecommendations\nAvailable at £14.99/19.99€/$19.99 on Steam and a few quid more on XBOX, Ori and the Blind Forest clocks in at around 7-9 hours play time and is good value for money for those who love the metroidvania genre of gaming. For us casual players and/or anyone with a low tolerance to frustration this is still worth a play for the fun aesthetics and world design alone, but may worth waiting to grab during a -50% or -75% sale.\n\n* There are a few cool, subtle Easter Eggs and references in the game including a Wilhelm scream, Super Meat Boy, a Mario Pipe, a Tri-Force and more\n* There's a good AMA from the developers here on reddit\n\nUnedited review notes 13/11/2015 for Ori and the Blind Forest:\n+The soul link save point system can be strategic and useful for highly skilled or extremely particular players\n-The soul link save point system is mostly an awful waste of time at best and is constantly ridiculously frustrating and annoying\n+Incredible art style, I'd genuinely like to watch this game being played by someone skilled because it'd remove the annoyance and frustrations\n-Overly complicated controls, legends, mapping systems etc\n-Just doesn't compare to Outland in terms of refinement in design\n-COMPLETELY different experiences and frustrations on Keyboard and Controller. Controls should be far more stable.\n-That forced and delayed loading screen annoys me a lot more than it should\n-Does a good job of making you want to go back and explore all the areas you've already visited with new skills, but then deletes your progress making that impossible after completing the game.. what?","November 14, 2015","true","20.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","1"

This title is well done in almost every way. This is a straightforward MetroidVania. You platform around the world to gain new abilities that allow you to access areas on the map that you previously couldn't. It doesn't bring anything new to the table (but then again, what AAA title does?), although this is acceptable because it is still a great addition to the genre.\n\nPros:\n+Beautiful artwork and music\n+Tight controls\n+Everything from platforming to combat feels smooth\n\nMeh:\n=Storyline. It might be good, but I have a hard time figuring out what is going on. I honestly still don't know who Ori is, even though they are referred to frequently. Its fine.\n\nCons:\n-They probably should have explained the interface better. After ~2 hours, I am just figuring out what the life bar is, etc.\n-Some platforming sections are brutally hard, IMO. Yeah I played Super Meat Boy as well. Its not that difficult bothers me as much as I found myself getting frustrated and wanted to just experience the game without serioues effort.\n\nYeah its worth full price. Especially if you like MetroidVanias. Although, if you are looking for a story-rich experience, just be aware that it may not be equally satisfying for everybody (at least for the first 2-3 hours, as far as I have played).","November 26, 2015","true","2.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","12","17","3","3"

If you have played Dust: An Elysian Tail, you should be familiar with the game-play style of Ori, a Metrodvania like game with RPG like elements, collecting orbs to gradually level up Ori choosing from three different routes of upgrades.\n\nFor those interested, I was playing on an MSI GS70 2PC (GTX 860m GPU, Intel i7 4700 CPU), and obtained a solid 60FPS when on charge, and around 53-58 FPS average when on battery. In addition, I played using headphones, and would recommend either headphones or a 5.1 surround sound set up for this game, due to some extraordinary sound effects which help create for an emmersive experience (should note, was using Sound Blaster Cinema 2 for sound enhancement).\n\nNevertheless, to list a few negative points 1) Unable to configure keyboard layout (to my knowledge) 2) Game can be completed in 3 hours or less (there's an achievment for doing so) 3) No adjustable difficulty settings, 4) FPS less stable when windowed.\n\nNo doubt, personal best game of the year 2015 so far.","March 10, 2015","true","13.3"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","22","36","0","0"

Throughout my playthrough of that story and adventure, I shed tears in a few events in the game because of how impactful it was, and that was the first time I ever had tears fall for a game.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth as butter, with nice solid controls which combined with solid and challenging platforming, brings amazingly great gameplay in finely designed levels for you to play and progress through. The game is challenging, and it gets more so the more you play through it, with more abilities and perks you will unlock to help but to also preform more of the complex platforming that's required in some areas, so the game is kept fresh throughout til the end.\n\nThe problems with the game is that wall jumping isn't as solid as the rest of the platforming goodness, but sufficient enough that you won't notice its issues down the line when it's covered in more gameplay experience and future perks. You can't select what part in time you want to re-play after finishing the game, so if you finish the campaign, and you want to reply some section or restart from the begging with all your progression, you can't, you will have to replay the whole game again and so on.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest is a work of legends, its innovation is its greatness. It is a combination from the works of recent Rayman games with its fluidity, in fact greater, combined with Studio Ghibli and Disney productions that are of the highest quality. It's as if all the combined powers and talents of those amazing studios were put into the creation of a game, and you get Ori and the Blind Forest, and I'd say the people behind this game are one of the most talented and imaginative minds of this generation, they have created a game worthy of being in a history book of awesome game legends, if there ever was a book like that. We now have a new studio that can compete with those top tier studios, in a form of producing amazing games, and this one is the first game of hopefully many others to come.\n\nShameless link[ksalue.com] to original post.","March 12, 2015","true","9.8"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","15","23","2","0"

Despite having played ridiculously good games like Portal, no game has ever prompted me to say something.\n\nBut this game simply took my breath away from beggining to end, its inspiring emotion and beauty got me started on it, and  its addicting gameplay kept me going until the end (I will play it through again to get all the achievements etc).\n\nThe gameplay is seamless and really fun, intense action, exploration and some puzzles to solve here and there. It is truly exceptional.\n\nWe all talk about how graphics don't make a game. But I cannot help but praise this game's beauty. This is the first game ever to make me feel like the creator's vision made it directly into the game. I always sigh when I see a game's concept art and then look at the final product and notice  the huge loss in "coolness" specially in 3d settings. 'Ori and the Blind Forest' doesn't suffer from this, you get to feel like you are playing inside a hand-drawn piece of art. That's the only way I can describe it, you are playing within an artistic piece.\n\nLast but not least, the music score. This exceptional composer has sold me, I will be buying the album for this game which is just so perfect for it. In most games I usually just end up listening to my own music. I could not do that here, this enthralling score conveys so many emotions and really submerges you into the game if the rest of it already didn't. The music is simply stuck in my head because I love it SO MUCH.\n\nThis game is living proof that video games are a form of art\n\nPLEASE SUPPORT THESE PEOPLE, I WANT MORE GAMES LIKE THIS AND MORE CONTENT FOR ORI","April 3, 2015","true","16.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Perhaps the most striking thing about this game at first glance is the presentation. It is gorgeous, like a painting in motion. Ori and the other characters move very fluidly, and the visual effects, from the various explosions of sparks to the projectiles, are striking. The music is dramatic and moving, giving the game the feel of a high-quality animated film. The plot, as simple and sparse as it is, helps to keep you moving to restore the forest.\n\nIf you're worried that Ori is all style and no substance, fear not - there's plenty of challenging platforming to be had here. This is a Metroidvania, so you'll gain your traversal abilities as you progress through the game. By the end of the game, you'll be tasked with bouncing off walls, enemies, and projectiles through cramped areas where spikes and lava surround you on every side. Mercifully, you have the ability to create a checkpoint on any solid ground, so if there's a section you're having trouble with, you don't have to replay long stretches of the game just to get another shot at it. Just remember to actually use the ability - I know I've lost significant progress a few times because I forgot.\n\nIn short, Ori and the Blind Forest is an incredible product in every aspect. It hits it home with the presentation, and it'll put your platforming skills to the test. If you like beautiful games with challenging gameplay, this comes highly recommended.","April 6, 2015","true","10.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Some achievements are for no readily apparent reason completely broken, and you can be locked out of an area you hadn't finished exploring fully yet.\n\nBut apart from that, the game is bloody fantastic. Fluid and well made platforming and combat and one of the most gorgeous platformers on the market for sure. And while it tells you the story, it also lets you experience it through making you struggle as the last part of the game is REALLY difficult. I'll just list Pros and Cons, it's easier that way.\n\nPros:\nOne of the most beautiful platformers out there.\nSimple, yet fantastic and well executed story.\nVery fluid platforming. At no point did the game feel unfair and whenever I died, it was my own fault.\nCombat is, although simplistic, very satisfying and pretty unique in it's own way.\nThe music is bloody great and really helps with the mood of the game. Cons:\nAs mentioned before, it's nigh-impossible to complete due to broken achievements and some oversights in the game itself.\nThe performance is odd to say the least. On some machines, V-Sync cuts your animation speed in half while still running fine. As well as having some, although not many, framedrops even on my GTX 960. Although the framedrops are never bad enough to make it unplayable. More so like, 55fps instead of the usual 60.\nRather short. Looking at in game time, I came up a bit over 6 hours, and that's with backtracking for most of the items.\nI'd definitely recommend this game, although at it's length, twenty bucks can be a bit too much for people. Keep the length of the game in mind for your purchase, because it might be better for you on sale. But for someone like me who's fan of the genre, I'd say definitely give this game a try.","June 12, 2015","true","9.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

From a moving starting intro, the game puts you into the feet of ori, a foxlike spirit. As you journey with him, you learn about the dangers that are befalling this world, crumbling apart around him, and you attempt to fix it. Though this premise seems pretty simple, The story branches into areas entirely unexpected, with twists that even i couldn't predict. New events are constantly happening. But what makes the story so brilliant is the way it shown to you in the game. Along with 2 or three stunning cutscenes, the story is displayed to you, while you are moving through the world. The story doesn't just happen, you literally walk into it, and events just take off with you in the drivers seat. The characters all have their own personalities and goals, which is incredibly hard to do considering THEY NEVER TALK ONCE.  And the story only gets better, leading to a shocking and great ending\n\nGameplay: Considering this a a platformer, platforming is the one aspect they had to get right, or the game would just fall apart. And man did they get it right. Every movement and jump is extremely fluid and easy to perform, with each movement quickly transitioning into the next. In the platfroming aspect, one notable part is the 'bash' ability, which allows ori to propell off of enemy projectiles. This is core to the gameplay, and allows the player to jump all around the map with ease. The platforming is truly polished, hard enough that when something is nailed, it feels good, but easy enough that anyone can do it. The platforming is never still jumping, either. You are always moving in a direction, and i never had to stop once, unless taking screenshots (which you will do a lot)\n\nTo mix up the platforming, combat and puzzles are incorporated. Likewise to said previously, it is hard enough that when something is nailed, it feels good, but easy enough that anyone can do it. But what makes this amazing is that both the puzzles and combat is as fluid as the platforming, and does not slow the game down at all. But what makes the combat and puzzles GREAT is that they still all use platforming in some way.\n\nThis is  in the metroidvania style, which usually consists of backtracking and going in the wrong direction.  In ori, no matter which direction i ended up going, it always ended up being the right direction. The game does a great job in guiding you to objectives, but still giving you free rein as to how you'll get there, and this free rein only increases as time goes on. Something is always happening to push you to a certain place, and you may go one way to be sent in a totally different direction.\n\nThere is always a sense of progression too, with areas being long enough that there is a good amount of content,yet short enough that it always feels fresh. New abilities are always being unlocked, all completely changing how you move through the world. Generally in these styles of games, one or two abilities are seen once, and never used again. In this, everything has an impact from start to end.\n\nSomething certainly notable is the save mechanic. Instead of having autosaves or set checkpoints, ori and the blind forest uses what is known as 'energy' by consuming energy cells, a temporary checkpoint is creating, where you will respawn every time you die. But, you have a finite amount of energy cells, so there is risk/reward in saving a checkpoint for later, or using it immediately and possibly run out when you need them. energy cells are also important for making shortcuts, finding secrets, or for use in combat, so decisions have to be made whether to use it for a save and not be able to fight anenemy as easily, or use it to kill the enemy and risk dying at a later stage, only to respawn and do it again.\n\nGraphics: Its amazing just how incredible it is. I do not take screenshots all too often in games, but in the 5 or so hours it took me to complete this game i have taken a dangerously high amount. Every area is themed beautifully, as the area moves around you.\n\nOther notable aspects: Theres a reason this game is tagged as great soundtrack. You should probably get this game just based on the soundtrack alone, its that good. Every piece sets the tone perfectly of each area, and as the tension in the game increaases, the music responds likewise.\n\nGames like this are the reason i play video games, and although the time spent on ori and the blind forest was short, there has been no other game yet that has been better time spent.\n\nIf you are reading this now, i hope you get this game, if you still do not want to get it, then i feel sorry for you.\n\nOh, and you should probably play this with a controller.","December 25, 2015","true","6.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

I'd seen other people struggling to play the game. Then I decided to play through it myself.\n\nFirst off, the games graphics are absolutely gorgeous. It's a 2D game that doesn't feel flat at all. There's so much to look at on every screen! Sometimes the screen does feel a bit 'busy' and it can be tricky to tell if something is actually going to hurt/kill me or not.\n\nThe music in the game is fantastic as well. I enjoyed every minute of it even if when I was getting frustrated with some of the gameplay aspects.\n\nThe game is a platformer, and the controls feel more or less solid. Sometimes wall jumping or jumping would feel just a bit off, but I'm guessing that was more my errors rather than the game messing up. The ability to save at any point was both a blessing and a curse. Sometimes I would forget to save, and I would have to redo a difficult jumping sequence over.\n\nThere were a few things I disliked about the game, the first was all the death traps. Especially the lasers. I made a comment about playing it that one of the developers must have a thing for 'death laser porn'. Be warned! This game has some brutal death traps. At least the game prevented me from creating a save point in an area where death traps were.\n\nI think my least favorite part of the game were the dramatic 'escape sequences'. Much like Metroid games, when Ori finishes a dungeon, he has to rapidly escape the area.  This happens not once, not twice, but three times in the game. If I died at any point along the escape sequence, I would have to restart from the very beginning. Let's also factor in the fact that they featured instant death traps and they were timed in one way or another.  Honestly, I feel like it was a dramatic part of the game that could probably have used a bit of tweaking/playtesting to make it less stressful for the player.\n\nOverall:\nPros:\nA fun platformer with some unique movement abilities\nGreat Music\nGreat Visuals\n\nCons:\nToo many death traps\nPlatformer (might be a con for some people).\n\nI'd give the game a solid 8/10 myself.","February 22","true","8.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

At certain points in the game, it'll give you that little soundtrack boost to your focus. The people who made the soundtrack did an absolutely stunning job at it. Not only will you have some of it stuck in your head after playing the game, you'll maybe fall in love with it and replay it over... and over.... and over... and over.. again. The soundtrack from me gets a 10/10 for it's stunning performance!\n\nNow lets talk about the gameplay. At first it might feel a little slow, but things really pick up the pace later in the game. With the platformer type of feel to the game, I would say anyone could enjoy this game. The challenges that await you in this game CAN get hard at some point and you may keep dying. You should always keep a good save point where you can pick yourself up if you fall. The mechanics are amazing and the skills help during the game a lot. Everything was very easy to learn and remember while you play throughout the game. Gameplay gets a solid 10/10!\n\nNow my FAVORITE part about this game, the VISUALS. The visuals are gorgeous. The color, the movement, the style, it's a feast for your eyeballs. If there's one thing about this game that I'm sure anyone would love, it's the style that this game was created. I could waste your time trying to explain how freaking good this feels to play, but it would take another 5 paragraphs. I have no other words than just AMAZING for the graphics and style. 11/10!!!\n\nOverall, this game is WELL worth the 20 dollars. As long as you know where to save and how to figure out some puzzles and escape certain doom, you should be fine! This game gets a 10/10. Would DEFINITELY recommend to a friend to play.

Everything blinks, glows in multitude of colors and makes an incredible, hand-drawn impression of game's world. Locations are distinctive, varied and memorable. Animation is buttery smooth eye joy and the music sells the package with the seal of awesome orchestral mastery. All of those elements are at its peak in few climaxes throughout the game. Those sections, while very spiking in difficulty in comparison to the whole game, are designed and directed FLAWLESSLY. Those moments sell the game! Music pumps you up, world crumbles and spins around and all you are trying to do is to win a gamble for your life... The payoff after those sections? Cathartic.\n\nWhile story wasn't a tearjerker for me in comparison to experience of others, but I definitely got invested in the game's world. Highest point of the narrative for me? The main antagonist. This isn't your standard videogames fare so this is very impressive on this fact alone. It's more an spiritual adversary in comparison to very direct, down-to-earth ones we are familiar with. Eerie, dark majesty of Kuro is always present and used to the full extent in many points of the game.\n\nThose are the high points. Where are the flaws? The main problem with Ori is that it is "just good" in other deparments, like gameplay. Don't get me wrong, you won't be dissapointed with this Metroidvania's mechanics and the flow and controls will enterntain you for sure. The only gripe is that not many implemented power-ups, ideas for gameplay and combat are new and innovative. There are some, like projectile bashing and a manual save-spot creating, but others are "just" competent. Not oustanding, just good enough. Combat really could use some spicing up, since it isn't as engaging as it could be. It's downplayed and judging by design of other parts of the game, it was an informed decision. That's why exploration aspects, controls and physics of jumps/dashes are more than enough to fill the gap.\n\nBut, that I'm talking about. Right now I'm in the middle of "I just finished incredible game and I just cannot take on another after the impression of the last one" hangover. And I'm not kidding you, I have Alien Isolation, Dark Souls and Talos Principle on my backlog right now, I just cannot make myself iup to push an "install" button.

It's almost like hanging out with a girl for a while, and you find yourself laying in bed thinking about her, and then it comes to you out of nowhere: "I love her." This is like that, but with video games.\n\nBut then you find out that the game is only 8 hrs long with little replayability. Then the kind of pain you feel would be like dating the girl you love, but only for 8 days. You find yourself playing through the game again much like how you might look over your old text messages from your sweetheart. You savor every moment, immersing yourself, all while having a deep, sorrowful pain in your chest knowing that your relationship only lasted so long.\n\nJust like this video game.\n\nBut you know what they say... Better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.\n\nDo not buy this on sale. Buy it at full price for $20, then buy the $10 soundtrack. It's worth it.","June 13, 2015","true","13.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The visuals are completely stunning, with different scenes blending into the others perfectly. The soundtrack could not be better - it fits the game so perfectly and makes the game so atmospheric.\n\nThe gameplay is great; extremely challenging yet not so hard that it makes you rage quit. There were times I got annoyed at a certain part because of constant dying, but repeating it out a couple of times eventually got me through. Despite being a platformer, this is one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nI barely ever review a game, with this being one of the first ever I have done.

Its probably the most beautiful looking platformer i've ever played, one of the most beautiful looking games recently period. Its not often that i think a game has the complete package but Ori comes very close, amazing visuals, great music and a beautiful story.\nAt first when i saw screenshots and small clips of gameplay i didn't really expect it to be a metroidvania but since i love platformers and love metroidvanias even more i was pleasantly surprised and i'm not sure if its because i'm used to platformers and metroidvanias but i really don't understand how people thought this game was hard, at all. Compared to a lot of other platformers and metroidvanias this game was really easy in its platforming and the save system is too generous, as soon as you get some energy you can save whenever you want, wherever you want and how often you want. If you just explore your surroundings you'll find plenty of life cells and energy cells which increases your maximum health and energy. And halfway through the game you have so much life and energy that you can barely spend it all, its mostly insta-kills that get you. You won't find as much health pickups as you do with energy pickups, so with an upgrade you start to get health back every time you save and that became my main source of health later on in the game. if i lost some health i just saved a few times and i was back to full health again.\n\nSo yeah, i really enjoyed the game. Its a great metroidvania, not too easy and not to hard, that does all of its platforming really well and fair, i didn't experience a single situation where i got frustrated because the game was unfair in some way or unnecessarily difficult. if i failed at a jump or something it was my own fault. but i get that some people saw the art style and thought it was going to be a lot easier and aimed to a younger demographic or something,\n\nReally awesome game, definitely worth a playthrough.

The visuals and music compliment each other so well, and stand tall on proud when separated into their own pieces. The controls felt very tight with a controller that I never wanted to even try out mouse/keyboard to see how it would run. Only a few times did I feel frustrated not being able to get somewhere, and every single instance I noticed I was trying to do things "the hard way" instead of following how the level designer wanted it to be done. Not an incredibly long play, Roughly 8 or so hours with a leisurely, I'm sure I want to see everything pace to finish it off, but not a minute felt wasted.

It has the exploration that I love from ye olde Castlevanias, but it also has a few difficult platforming sections that I love from Super Meat Boy. It has incredibly smooth controls and you can literally dance through the world once you mastered them. To top it all off, it has beautiful cinematics and environments.\n\n\nThis game could've been a 10/10 with ease, but I'd rate this 9.5/10 for two reasons; there are at the time of writing quite a few game-breaking bugs which I find unacceptable for a 'finished' game, and there are 'missable' collectibles. The areas in which these are found will be left ruined or blocked off. This means that if you care for 100% completion, you might need to do multiple playthroughs to find everything. I personally don't care for this much, but it's nice to see the whole map lit up and I can sympathize with people who do.\n\nThe final small thing I'd like to note is that it's not very long, only about 5 hours, maybe 6 for 100%. The replay value is quite minimal unless you're into speedrunning. It will be an exhilirating 5 hours though, so definitely well worth your time.","March 27, 2015","true","14.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Catelluss/recommended/261570/","Catelluss","Catellus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Catelluss/","272 products in account","100% credit to AuldWolf for saying it perfectly.:\n\nI'm going to miss this game.\nFor me, this was one of the greats.\n\nIt was like I'd entered a vortex to a parallel reality where gaming hadn't given into the mainstream; it hadn't become creatively bankrupt, desaturated, dead-eyed, xenophobic rot that one could complete in their sleep. Yet it had retained the best values of contemporary gaming form our reality. Fair, even-handed, challenging without ever punishing (it reminds me of VVVVVV in that regard).\n\nThere are certain games of each particular age of gaming that stand out as being something unique. Of this ilk, I can think of Okami, Knytt, and Ecco off the top of my head. Though oddly it shares most in common with Ecco. Once you've got at least the triple-jump and the dash, the movement becomes so precise and fluid that it might as well be underwater. It's a beautiful thing to watch.\n\nI'd rather seek egress from this place and find that reality where this sort of thing is commonplace. I'm a soulsick old fart, I admit. I have an imagination and worlds within my mind, I'm almost nauseated by how distressingly boring the average person is. Their mirrored minds each mimicking the last in grotesque displays of abominable extroversion, as though that were some kind of achievement. None of them with a word worth speaking.\n\nFor a while, playing this, my heart sang. I'll admit, I'm rarely happy. It comes with being introspective, creative, and intelligent. Sorry. Many people like myself have stated something along the lines of 'show me someone with those qualities whose often happy and I'll show you a liar.' Which isn't as eloquent as I could put it, but it'll suffice. What I'm trying to say is that this is a thing of rare beauty. I feel most entertainment creators these days simply don't care.\n\nAnd it was nice to play as something other than a human for once, too. I'm not fond of my species. I mean, if you'd experienced what I had, you'd understand. I'm mentally disabled, and physically too if you consider motor problems/the shakes to be a physical disability. I'm of a class of person so utterly despised and reviled that I'm wondering how long it'll be before we're all stuffed into gas chambers and flowery excuses are made of it. So I don't often relate to humans in entertainment.\n\nIt's worse, too, that they're often toned, Aryan in appearance, flat, extroverted, and as one-dimensional, soulless, hollow, fallow, empty, and paper-thin as they are 'beautiful.' These are homunculi. Not so different than zombies. Just zombies that the mainstream masses find appealing. It's a sort of conformist zombie, a Barbie & Ken zombie with bleak eyes. That's what gaming focuses on, today, so much.\n\nI think that as our brains are shrinking[discovermagazine.com] we're just becoming more narcissistic, extroverted, oxytocin-pumped, and generally xenophobic. And when I say xenophobic I mean ermahgerrd it's something I can't relate to, KILL IT WITH FIRE. So it's quite an achievement to create something like this that all those people can relate to, where they've been unable to relate to similar things in the past.\n\nI don't know how you pulled that off. But it's quite amazing. Gives an old fart just a sliver of hope.\n\nBut yes, I won't forget this game. I can't. It's today's Ecco the Dolphin. It's singularly unique, and it's unique in how singular it is. It's a thing untainted by what the mainstream might want, by what shareholders might desire. It's an alien, foreign, impossible creation. So it may not sell well, if that's the case, I'm generally sorry. We're kind of a crapsack species at the moment, what with all the greyscale serial killer simulators selling so well. So I'm sorry if you won't be able to make more like this.\n\nBut I appreciated it. And I know I can't be alone. And I know I'll miss it. I'll come back it at some point in the future. Likely a year or two from now. I might make it a case just to drop in and wander around, like my yearly sabbatical into Uru: Ages Beyond Myst to see Shroomie.\n\nWell done, Moon Studios.

I'm not very fond of platformers but because of how beautiful the screenshots were, I decided to bite the bullet. My initial thoughts were to blaze through this "just another indie 2D side-scroller" and mainly focus on looking at pretty things on the screen. I'm happy to say that was not the case.\n\nThe game surpassed my expectations and was able to excel at everything that makes a game good. It is incredibly rare nowadays for a game that can make me want to keep going and complete it. One thing the game does really well is its rewarding gameplay, there is a great sense of satisfaction from making a difficult jump, solving puzzles and figuring out new mechanics. The game is challenging, but not too difficult as I was still able to complete the game despite not being very good at platformers. (It probably took longer than average at certain portions.) Movement is very smooth and well done, it makes traversing the map very enjoyable. There is a bit of backtracking needed to complete optional requirements which I initially thought would be a chore, but you gain new abilities and certain changes to the map make it so fast and natural to move across the map. Overall, the gameplay experience was just really fun.\n\nIn terms of visuals, you can see it for yourself, it is absolutely gorgeous. The world is vibrant and full of life, different areas mesh up very nicely while being unique. There is a lot attention to detail and no assets are used more than once. Sound design and music is also top-notch. Gareth Coker has managed to a craft a beautiful and emotional score that matches up to different areas and sequences in the game, from soothing during peaceful times to intense when escaping death. The story was not hugely impactful for me but it is something very lovely that fits the game.\n\nI am not a fan of platformers but the developers at Moon Studios have created one that is so accessible and welcoming for me. Ori and the Blind Forest is incredible and will be one of the best games have I played.","June 29, 2015","true","12.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm not very fond of platformers but because of how beautiful the screenshots were, I decided to bite the bullet. My initial thoughts were to blaze through this "just another indie 2D side-scroller" and mainly focus on looking at pretty things on the screen. I'm happy to say that was not the case.\n\nThe game surpassed my expectations and was able to excel at everything that makes a game good. It is incredibly rare nowadays for a game that can make me want to keep going and complete it. One thing the game does really well is its rewarding gameplay, there is a great sense of satisfaction from making a difficult jump, solving puzzles and figuring out new mechanics. The game is challenging, but not too difficult as I was still able to complete the game despite not being very good at platformers. (It probably took longer than average at certain portions.) Movement is very smooth and well done, it makes traversing the map very enjoyable. There is a bit of backtracking needed to complete optional requirements which I initially thought would be a chore, but you gain new abilities and certain changes to the map make it so fast and natural to move across the map. Overall, the gameplay experience was just really fun.\n\nIn terms of visuals, you can see it for yourself, it is absolutely gorgeous. The world is vibrant and full of life, different areas mesh up very nicely while being unique. There is a lot attention to detail and no assets are used more than once. Sound design and music is also top-notch. Gareth Coker has managed to a craft a beautiful and emotional score that matches up to different areas and sequences in the game, from soothing during peaceful times to intense when escaping death. The story was not hugely impactful for me but it is something very lovely that fits the game.\n\nI am not a fan of platformers but the developers at Moon Studios have created one that is so accessible and welcoming for me. Ori and the Blind Forest is incredible and will be one of the best games have I played.","June 29, 2015","true","12.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

On the other hand when you made these difficult parts, the enjoy is really really big and you'll forget all the deaths just happened to you few minutes ago and continue in enjoying the game :)\n\nFrom the modern time games it takes character progression and skill tree, which is greatly balanced - very often you'll think, what skill you will need now and which you'll unlock later. As well as the saving system. You create so called "Soul links", for which you need an energy. But this energy is used in game for more purposes incl. the "battle" one. Great system :)\n\nThen there's its story about light and darkness, which brings you emotions and sometimes it really surprised me. It's a long time since I was looking forward for the end of the story (in good word meaning).\n\nAnd I like, that whole game is one big level, so there's no annoying loading. More difficult parts are accessible after you get some skills, so you won't get to somewhere you can't handle. Geniusly simple, simply genius.\n\nAnd chapter for itself is music and graphic. In one word - beautiful.  Many times I just stared at it and said only "Wow" while listening the amazing soundtrack this game has. It can't be simply described - you have to see it and hear it.\n\nShortly said: This game worth every single cent it costs.

Microsoft Studios has molded an amazing piece of art into a two-dimensional platforming experience. Nothing assaults the senses. Instead, it caresses them with a beautiful soundtrack and a graciously painted art direction. The gameplay is as solid as they come, with every input and consequence very clear and rewarding in all of the right ways. While nothing is ultimately ground-breaking, the Blind Forest never tries to be something that it isn’t and as a consequence delivers one of the most satisfying adventures and stories that I’ve gotten to enjoy in a long time.\n\nThe world of Ori and the Blind Forest is one massive map that is slowly revealed to you once shortcuts are opened or puzzles are solved, usually with abilities that you gain from completing the game’s four puzzle-like “dungeon” areas that tie into the story. If the entire map was revealed to you early on, it would feel overwhelming as the game is without a fast-travel system that could make traversing quicker for the player. There is hardly any harm in this restriction however, as with the growth of the map comes the growth of Ori as a capable platformer of her very own. You will start with a basic jump and wall-hop that gets you from location-to-location, but in time will learn to glide, climb, swim, dash off of projectiles and even triple-jump.\n\nAs Ori, the player will not only need all of their finesse to master the platforming, but they also need to defend themselves against the variety of enemies and traps that fill the Blind Forest. The basic attack that Ori performs comes in the form of a “Spirit Flame” that hovers around her, which will automatically lock onto points of interest that are attacked as the player commands. The most basic attack is simply single-shots that chip away at enemy health, but through discovery and ability growth, can become a massive charge with a radius of effect. Ori herself will eventually become more than capable of defending herself with ground bashes and offensively-charged jumps, but perhaps the most fun to experiment with is when the player slingshots themselves off of an enemy projectile to reach new heights which can also turn the projectile back onto an enemy itself. You don’t comprehend how important this one ability will become until some time after acquiring it, but it is perhaps the most game-changing of all and is extremely fun to mess around with.\n\nThe player will learn to memorize the map as they travel, including areas that were previously explored before you had a new ability that gets you to new heights or through a previously impassable wall. What this means is that going back to old areas to explore new possibilities is rewarding, as it should be in a game that has so much to offer once you know how to scale it better and faster than when you first started out. This feels great for the player is a great reason to backtrack to a place that you’ve already been. Using new abilities (like the slingshot mechanic) will open up possibilities that may not even click with the player at first. It generates a feeling of genuine excitement when you begin unraveling all that these new tools can let you accomplish.\n\nAs the one doing the exploring, Ori has the potential to grow beyond just finding and using new abilities throughout the world. There is a minimal RPG element to the game in the form of passive talents that are spread across three trees. You gain experience that unlocks these talents in the order of your choosing through defeating enemies, destroying small pieces of the environment, or by discovering experience pickups (cells) throughout the world. Some of these even offer a straight talent point to spend immediately, which is another very tangible award for the player to find through exploring and experimentation. This ensures that the world and all that the developers hid within it is not wasted.\n\nThe character’s capabilities grow and with them, the player. At the beginning of the game you will feel vulnerable and minimally capable of some legitimately challenging feets. But by the end of the adventure, you will know the world inside and out, overcoming challenges that have you wall-jumping and projectile-hopping like it’s all second-nature. The level of skill that it takes is easy to master as the game never overburdens you or gives you too much to be familiar with at once. The pacing is laid out thoughtfully and fantastically.\n\nThe music and sound design are perfectly tuned to help carry the emotions that grow naturally through the experiences that the player will encounter. Intense gauntlets have a climactic sound to back up the urgency of the moment, long stretches of traversion give the atmosphere some relaxation, moments of very clear danger (like when the antagonist is right on your heels) keep you on the edge of your seat. Every jump has emotion attached to it, every attack has a rushing sense of urgency and desperation. The entire world is laid out very intentionally and every obstacle with purpose.\n\nThis isn’t to say that Ori and the Blind Forest is easy, because it isn’t. While the game lends you every tool and ability that is required to get through the challenges that you face, the challenges themselves do not pull their punches. Quick reflexes and tight responses to the environmental dangers that you face become absolutely necessary to get further and further. The game’s save mechanic is unique in that it is triggered as an ability that Ori uses, called a “Soul Link”. You can activate a Soul Link at almost any time and place and will need to do so often, as death is often quick and unforgiving. Once death almost inevitably strikes, you are instantaneously sent back to the Link that you left behind. It can take some time to become accustomed to saving enough that you don’t have to redo certain segments of a stage or a challenge, but it becomes second nature within the first hour of playing. The best part of this is perhaps that there is virtually zero downtime after a death; you can jump right back into a challenge platform segment or enemy ambush with the same gusto as before.\n\nThe story is lightly told through short cinematics that are often paired with some mysterious and mystical narration. The game gives no more than is necessary, often leaving it up to the player to interpret who or what is speaking at times. With the protagonist being controlled by the player, the main antagonist is brought into various stages as an obstacle or a temporary danger until a puzzle is solved or a conflict is resolved. The way in which the game narrates the world brings shades of grey into an otherwise black-and-white good-guy-versus-the-world situation that makes the antagonist relatable and worth sympathizing for. Ori exists within a world that has its very own ecosystem, which can be easy to forget. The antagonist has a nature of its own that makes sense within the world and therefore its own sense of what is good for its own well being. You do not get to simply desire its destruction, but instead seek to avoid it altogether.\n\nAt the end of the day, it does my heart good to suggest Ori and the Blind Forest to anybody that is on the edge for this one. It’s a steal for $20 and is easily worth double. It rewards completionists, gives a wonderful experience to casual gamers, and tells a heart-felt story that can throw you into emotional hurdles that you weren’t expecting. I couldn’t be more satisfied with such a lovely piece of work. It’s a beautifully functional piece of art, a definite must-buy, and cheap enough to gift for somebody after you’ve been won over by its charm.","March 26, 2015","true","11.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It is difficult, it can frustrate you at times, but it will make you want to try again and again and again to get through each stage, and will give you a sense of achievement once you succeed in doing so.\n\nAn amazing game, definitely worth it at its full price.

Ori and the Blind Forest is at its core a Metroidvanian like many others, but the execution is just impeccable. Never before have I been so awed by 2D graphics as here, this is truely one, if not the best looking platformer ever. It goes beyond pretty screenshots too, because nearly everything animateable is animated, and they feel so fluent and impactful that it really enhances your immersion in the world. The music is also of very high quality throughout the whole game, absolutely gorgeous.\n\nThe gameplay itself is bizarelly smooth. I don't think any other platformer I've played can compare with the smoothness and joy it is to move Ori through the world. Again, the animations really help with enhancing this. Combat is not the most interesting in the game, though enjoyable, but given the relatively short length I never felt like it was an issue, especially when you get the super fun Dash ability!\n\nMany people talk about its high difficulty. I personally didn't experience this so much, but I noticed friends of mine were really struggling. For me, the difficulty was high enough to keep being challenging and rewarding while only very sporadically getting to the point of frustration, but with the great pacing of the game this was never a lasting issue.\n\nWhile this is without a doubt the best action platformer I have ever played, it is not without its flaws. While the art invites a great story, this is unfortunately not the case, riddling in boring cliches such as finding 3 elements and "save-the-world syndromes". There really isn't as much narrative to the game as you would expect from it at first glance either. The prologue and ending are the only moments where the game tries to pull your heartstrings, but I couldn't see either as particularily emotional. It also never dares to provide narrative content that is more challenging, unfortunately.\n\nFurthermore, the game is at no point truely innovative. While it surpasses them, the game clearly shows its inspirations, and at no point truely adds anything new to it. However, it's an example that crafting a game with such love and attention to detail can be one of the most impressive works of the last few years.\n\nI'm feeling a strong 8 to a light 9.","March 14, 2015","true","8.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Ori and the Blind Forest is the rare game I can call perfect.\n\nThe world map functions as a cohesive whole, with each area connecting seamlessly to the next. As Ori scampers, climbs, flips, hand-springs, and glides from forest to ruins to swamp to mountains, you gain a real sense of the world you are fighting to save. As with any Metroidvania, you'll gain increased access to this diversity of areas as you master new abilities. But rather than being a repetitious slog, you will be eager to return to those areas you previously could not reach. And the more you see, the more you realize this prickly, beautiful, dangerous world is absolutely worth saving.\n\nWhile the platforming is unimpeachable, I have seen some criticism directed toward the game's combat. Although it can seem a little shallow at first, I can't think of it as a negative that the fighting is the game's least "deep" system. Just looking at Ori should make it clear that fighting is not his/her forte. That said, once you have gained a good amount of abilities/upgrades, combat does become very enjoyable. While spamming shots is always an option, skills like Bash and Stomp can open much more exciting avenues. Why stand and shoot a creature to death when you can grab its projectile weapon, reflect it into another enemy, hop over, stomp the guy who shot at you, then throw them headlong into some spikes, all whilst boosting yourself ever faster up toward the next platform? The combat is only as "boring" or "shallow" as you make it.\n\nOnce you realize that enemies can be chained together for speed boosts, or to gain access to areas that would otherwise be inaccessible, you'll see that combat and platforming are never truly separate concepts in Ori. Sometimes an enemy is better left alive than destroyed, and more often than not, the best answer is one that requires finesse, not brute strength and stubbornness. Ori's unique character isn't just a matter of gorgeously painted backdrops and tear-jerking cutscenes, it lives its spirit through its gameplay as well. And the game's evasive, fast-paced, high-flying, enemy-ricocheting style should appeal to speed-runners and people simply looking for a less violent platformer in equal measure.\n\nIn short, this game is a remarkable achievement. Much more than another indie flash-in-the-pan with novel graphics. Ori is a masterwork of design and presentation, and is incredibly fun besides. Buy this game now. It is perfect.","March 26, 2015","true","18.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

The following is an overview of what points I like and don't like about Ori and the Blind Forest:\n\n[++] = very good, [+] = good, [°] = neutral, [-] = bad:\n\n[++] soundtrack. Atmospheric, emotional sounds of instrumental orchestra are a real pleasure to listen to. I even died intentionally before the end of the Ginso Tree just to listen to the music a bit more, and the interpretation of the Sorrow Pass nearly made me cry, that's how good the soundtrack is. Probably one of the best soundtracks ever in a videogame.\n\n[+] graphics. Very detailed, colorful, varying landscapes reveal the game's great aesthetics, and the character models are beautiful as well. The performance is really smooth, too; I had no problems running the game on maximum settings on an ATI Radeon HD 5870 1GB on HD resolution (1680x1050 @ 60fps).\n[+] level design. Great level design rewards you for being an explorer to discover all the life cells, energy cells, skill points, experience points, map fragments and map stones scattered all across the giant map. These secrets will most likely require backtracking, but I never had a problem with that since I always discovered new locations and secrets on the way. Everything about the map is coherent and makes sense. You might for instance wonder why some enemies respawn occasionally, until you find out that there is an ability which you can use to take advantage of enemies and their projectiles to reach areas you might never thought you could reach. It feels really fulfilling to discover these areas and achieve 100% completion.\n[+] skill system. This game comes with some RPG elements, you can use your skill points to unlock skills for Ori on three different skill trees. To unlock the better abilities on a particular skill tree, you at least need to have unlocked all the previous abilities, so your choice really matters and affects your gameplay experience. Do you want to fire multiple shots at once, to collect experience points more easily or to resave in locations where you have already saved? Do you prefer the ability to hit four targets at once or a triple jump and better defense? (I would recommend the rightmost tree with the triple jump and better defense, these abilities are the best in my opinion, but again - it's all up to you.) In addition to the skill tree, you earn 8 abilities through so-called ancestral trees, which will not only help you tremendously throughout your adventure, but also make the combat more diversified, because you won't have to rely solely on your standard attack to kill enemies - you can stomp on them, reflect their projectiles, bash them into dangerous obstacles which will kill them instantly and so on. My favourite ability has to be the bash ability, because it can be used in a very versatile way and rewards your skill more than any other ability.\n[+] story. To be honest, I didn't pay that much attention to it on my first playthrough, because I was too busy listening to that awesome soundtrack, but later I realized how emotional and stirring, but also how coherent and logical it was within the game's context. You can skip the five "movie cutscenes" (but not everything, see below). I won't spoil anything for you, so I'll just move on to the next point.\n[+] price. You get more content from Ori for 20€ than you get from some so-called AAA-titles for 60€ and more. The only problem is the lack of multiplayer (but on the other hand, what should a multiplayer in a 2D-platformer look like?), you only have some meaningless leaderbords with people who completed the game the fastest.\n\n[°] difficulty. Don't be fooled by the cute graphics into thinking that this is the easiest game ever, it's actually really difficult in comparison to all the other 2D-platformers currently on the market. There will be some tricky passages that you will almost certainly die on your first attempt, and the enemies can be a real pain in the beginning of the game when you don't have the bash skill. I would love to tell you how often I died on my first playthrough, but I can't (see below). Regardless, I think I died about a hundred times. The last area seems to have enraged some bigger reviewers out there, and sure it is challenging, but it's also fair since it really tests how well you can handle the abilities given to you. People who claim otherwise either want an easy final level or have no skill. Do you like challenging games? If not, this might not be the game for you. In my case, I liked the challenge in this game, so I classified this point as neutral.\n\n[-] no post-credits play. You can't explore the world after you beat the game, you can't even select your save file to see how often you died in total. You should also make sure to collect everything you can before Mount Horu, because you won't be able to return. However, the creature next to Ori tells you just that before entering Mount Horu, so that's not such a big issue for me.\n[-] save game system. To save, you have to use one (with upgrades: half of a) skill point. When you need four skill points to open a gate and you have just mastered a difficult passage, you better not save, because otherwise you'll not be able to open that gate, you will have to backtrack just to refill that one missing skill point, which almost frustrated me on some occasions. On top of that, you can't save when you're near an enemy or on fragile grounds, but that makes sense in my opinion, because when you reload your save file, you want to be safe in that spot and not be killed by some enemy before you can even react. Besides that, I recommend to save a lot on the first playthrough, since there can always be some instant death trap a few centimeters away from you or a different unfortunate hazard like spikes which you can't get out of, so you'll die as a result (prime example has to be the enormous spider's web, which falls on the spikes below. I jumped down and was dead because of spikes I couldn't see in the first place, which was really frustrating). And remember, when you die, you'll have to do everything again from your last save: if you collected some secret cells or went to numerous locations you wanted to explore and then died because of an inconveniently placed hazard, good luck recalling all the places you've been to.\n[-] instant death. Without a doubt, there are too many instant death traps for my taste. I often thought that I have so much life left that it's not necessary for me to save, and a few moments later I was dead because of some laser beam or spikes one could not get out of, so that I got hit over and over again until I died. By the way, some spikes really are instant death traps, while others are not - that's inconsistent and confusing at times.\n[-] unskippable scripted sequences. You can skip five "movie cutscenes", but you'll have to watch the smaller cutscenes with text overlay, whether you want it or not. Yes, the story is really good, but on my fourth and fifth playthrough I already know the story, so I don't think it's necessary to forcibly show me them again.\n[-] rebinding keys. Though you can play with a controller on PC or play with keyboard and mouse (or keyboard exclusively, which I've never tried out), I have not found the option to rebind keys, which is just laughable, sorry. I prefer the arrow keys over wasd-controls, but I couldn't change the controls, so I had to get accustomed to the predefined control set. Luckily, I could get used to the controls easily, but considering the game's difficulty, I can understand that people who can't get used to them might get frustrated, especially when the assignment of keys becomes the reason for not being able to complete a passage (instead of the lack of skill).\n[-] minor glitches/bugs","March 28, 2015","true","83.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Throw all this in with some good platforming and puzzles that have just enough challenge to them to get you riled up, and you have one game I cannot recommend enough.\n\nThis being said, there are a couple of niggles with this game as well. The controls are not rebindable, kind of unnaceptable for any game released after 1997. The options in general are kind of lacking. The mouse cursor does not lock to the game, even in fullscreen, making this game a pain with more than one monitor hooked up. The character animations seem to be locked at 30fps in some parts of the game, making them look very choppy compared to everything else (although this may just be on my client).\n\nAlso, I would recommend a controller for this game. I started playing with a keyboard, and switched to a controller about halfway through.  It feels much more natural on the controller. That being said, I did switch back to keyboard because I just couldn't learn a new control scheme halfway through and still play the game effectively.\n\nI'd give this game a overall 9.9 out of 10, a must own for anyone and everyone.","March 15, 2015","true","9.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Nah you don't know ♥♥♥♥ about games! So here's my review of Ori and the Blind Forest.\n\nWhere to start though? If it had beautiful art, that would have been enough. If it had solid controls, that would have been enough. If it left me wanting more, that would have been enough! Ori and the Blind forest does all three for me and more than that.\n\nSo about Ori and the Blind Forest, it's a metroid-vania style game, which if you're unaware means that as you play the game you unlock new abilities and skills that allow you to visit places you couldn't get to before. Like gaining the ability to double jump up to a higher place or ground pound through an obstruction. There are some games that do this okay (Terraria), some do this really well (Shovel Knight), but Ori does it absolutely almost perfectly. Getting the little items and upgrades for my health and energy were challenging but not impossible which can be attributed to the excellent controls. Fortunately this game takes more after Castlevania more than Metroid and as such the opening of the map is MUCH more organic. It's not perfect, mind. there are some locations that close off forever and if you didn't get all the collectibles say goodbye to 100% completion. An intentional design flaw made to punish those who just can't deal unless they have 100% of something, which I'm thankful for in this game. If you're playing to 100% the game then you've obviously forgotten what video games are for.\n\nNow onto the controls. Typical WASD, space, shift, e, left, and right mouse key. At the beginning, all you have are these but as you go you get better skills from these spirit trees that make more of the game accessible and running around the map more easy. It's also worth noting that moving around is fun as hell late game. I found myself getting into a rythm bouncing off enemies and projectiles and super jumping through terrain, killing all the enemies in the room and landing on the other side of a spiked area completely unharmed. It's this near perfect mix of speed of progress and difficulty that makes it so engaging. It's got that Sonic the Hedgehog smooth as butter kind of movement.\n\nAs far as game mechanics go it doesn't bring much new to the table except one thing, making your own save points. If you have enough energy you can make your own save location. It's not exactly anything more than a quick saving feature made less efficient but I thought it was pretty nifty. It is from these save points that you buy upgrades for yourself with spirit orbs that you collect from enemies and upgrade orbs hidden throughout the map. You have three upgrade trees: Utility, Combat, and Utility ++. Utility does things like double the energy, life, and spirit orbs you absorb. Combat is pretty obvious. Increase the power of your shots, increase the number of enemies they can hit at a time, etc. And Utility ++ is kind of a hodgepodge. You can tell they were struggling for a third tree because basic design law dictates that a repition of three is the most attractive. But Utility ++ is like adding a third jump to your double jump, recovering life every time you make a save point, etc. Also the skill "trees" are more like skill twigs at best. A single line for each tree, no branching, or choosing this or that skill. But that's okay. The upgrade system might be my least favorite part of the game but that's okay since everything else is polished to a mirror shine.\n\nI'm not going to talk about the story much because this is a story that deserves to be told by the game. So instead I'll give the premise. You are Ori, a spirit of light working to restore life to a now dead land. Some sad things happen some happy things happen. You ain't getting no more. BUY THE GAME!\n\nNow on to my favorite part, the artwork. Jesus William Christ the artwork. Beautiful, vibrant color, outstanding design, and the animation... just... there are no words for all the emotions this game made me feel through the art alone. The animation is just so gorgeous there are no words in existence to accurately depict how much I love it. You have to see it. Not to mention the sound design. I have never heard quite as beautiful a sound design as that. A lot of games treat music as just white noise not to be payed attention to and really only meant to occupy your brain. (Terraria, Call of Duty, freakin Borderlands!) I actually found myself staying in certain areas just to sit and listen to the music. And when you get to event areas the music picks up the pace and gets your blood pumping like crazy as you're bombarded with massive amounts of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and you're just trying to stay alive and you want the music to calm down and just as you're ABOUT to die... you make it out and this relieving music plays and makes everything all better. There were times when my arms were jelly afterwards. It's a game that engaged me and made me feel things, and that is miles more than I can say for a lot of other games like Borderlands or even Skyrim. (Not to say that either was bad) I'm even rereading over this and this paragraph doesn't accurately describe how much I loved the artwork. So I implore you not to take my word for it and instead go look for yourself.\n\nI'll go ahead and wrap up my thoughts with this. It probably sounds like a cliche at this point but I believe in one general truth with video games. That is that there are two types. The first type being one that was made so that the creators could add a new golden sex dungeon to their money palace because they have a product that they know people will buy regardless of it's quality (The Sims or any EA games or Call of Duty or Halo 4 and 5). And the second type being one that was made because the creators had an idea that needed and deserved to be shared with the world. (Bastion, Dark Souls, and XCOM: Enemy Unknown) And Ori and the Blind Forest is definitely in the latter category. So here's what I would like for you to do. Find about $17, go on steam, and buy this game. No. Stop. Don't torrent. Normally I'm okay with it, but Moon Studios deserves your support for creating this, dare I say, masterpiece.","June 13, 2015","true","24.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The entire game is eye candy. Great animations and cutscenes. Enviroments are extremely colorful and diverse. Enemies are recycled a bit but I was happy enough with the variation.\n\nMusic is well done, but I have some problems with it. Most of it sounds quite similar. What I mean by that is lots of calm atmospheric tunes and very little stray from that genre. Despite all the songs sounding pleasant and relaxing, I wasn't really hooked by any of them. The music does not attempt to emulate classic metroid, castlevania, or even zelda tunes. It goes full orchestra-esque. You will not find anything funky like Super Metroid's Brinstar, or retro and catchy like Castlevania's main theme. It's all sort of background music that does it's job and fits the theme but I feel like the composer could have experimented a bit more. None of the music ever made me stop and just listen for a while. I suppose one could argue that the composer was not going for that angle, but with a metroidvania game I feel like emulating different styles to try and give that unique platformer feel to each level is better than just making a "one genre" album for the entire game. I want to hear music that makes me say "oh ♥♥♥♥, I should download this." Again, don't get me wrong. The music was good, but personally coming from a platformer background with genre expansive tunes, I wasn't that interested in most of the songs.\n\nStory is excellent. I don't want to spoil anything so I will leave it at that. I played this game drunk a couple times and that was a huge mistake. It's often very touching.\n\nGameplay is very patience demanding. If you start to tilt you will find yourself continuously dying. That said it is very skillful and rewarding when you get past a difficult part. I often found myself swearing when I'd be at an intense moment and mess up. Sort of like the newer donkey kong games. Some mechanics of the controls aren't quite 100%. The jumping is fluid but not as much as classic titles of this genre. Players familiar to the platformer genre will most likely find themselves slightly screwing up an important jump just because it handles ever so slightly off. It's not by any means huge, but it's noticeable sometimes. I kind of missed the fact that there were no boss battles, only boss "encounters." There were mini boss fights but they weren't that noteworthy. With all the great mechanics to this game I was hoping the developers would implement some interesting boss fights.\n\nGame is awesome. If you like platformers you will enjoy this. If you like touching stories you will enjoy this. If you like a challenge you will enjoy this. I'd definitely recommend this game.\n\n","November 27, 2015","true","8.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Ori is brilliant in every sense of the word, and unlike many of my favorite games, it isn't niche in the slightest. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone and everyone.\n\nI'd heard others describe the game as basically playing a Pixar movie before I started it. It's not the first time I've heard that said about a game, but this is the first time when the similarities went beyond the character design and basic story tone. Ori is a fundamentally lighthearted game that isn't afraid to venture into darker themes, and everything about the game reflects that. The music, level design, art, writing, and even enemies have a plethora of different tones, but they all come together perfectly to express whatever the game is saying at that moment. The story, for its part, never has more than 4 lines of spoken or written text in a row. It's overwhelmingly conveyed through the motions and expressions of unspeaking characters, and it works because of the remarkable quality of the animation.\n\nThe animation's arguably more important contribution is to the gameplay, however. Ori's movement, combining flips, spins, and even airplane arms, is wonderfully expressive, and it combines with near-perfect controls and great level design to produce a game that's simply fun. Like all metroidvanias, Ori requires tons of backtracking, especially to get the secrets, but unlike all other metroidvanias, I never got tired of it. I don't even like most platformers, but enjoyed just moving around in this game as much as Ori clearly does. Many similar little touches build up to an experience that dwarves the sum of its parts.\n\nOri is, at times, brutally difficult, but it's almost always fair, and I never really felt frustrated with it despite dying over 200 times.\n\nI think that about balances out to a positive.","January 28","true","9.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Ori and the Blind Forest exemplifies all that makes the Metroidvania genre so popular. It is a game that follows a fairly linear story, yet allows a considerable amount of exploration beyond and beside the intended path. It is a platformer that presents intimidating challenges, yet is consistently fair and forgiving because of the life bar and portable save points. Most of all, it's an absolutely gorgeous thing to behold, and the wondrous atmosphere puts any other platformer to shame. You needn't take more than a cursory glance at the trailer to realize this.\n\nProgression comes in the form of powers and abilities. The powers are what you'd expect from a classic Metroidvania - wall jumps, double jumps, and a downward smash technique that obliterates foes and obstacles alike. They all have multiple uses in travel and combat, and the mid-air bash in particular is highly enjoyable and unique. Abilities, on the other hand, are more like passive bonuses that offer assistance in various ways, such as revealing more secrets on the overworld map, increasing your attack damage or causing collectibles to float towards your character. Notably, none of the passive abilities are required to finish the game, so if you're a sucker for punishment you could get through it without spending a single point on them.\n\nTo figure out anything to complain about in this game would be a challenge in itself. Truthfully, it's about as close to perfection as the genre will get. If you don't enjoy Ori and the Blind Forest, it's because you don't like Metroidvanias at all, and that's fine. But those of us who do could have asked for nothing better.","April 14, 2015","true","21.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/recommended/261570/","codamadius","Frillin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/","139 products in account","Story Ori and the Blind Forest has a very simple story but don't for a second let that fact fool you. It's a story about love and loss and isn't exactly told through words but rather through actions. I wish I could say more, but part of the experience is watching and playing for yourself.\n\nGameplay The gameplay is flawless and very frustrating at times. Throughout your journey you'll encounter small puzzles, tough enemies and new abilities that help and allow you to progress. Take into account that this is a game that escalates the difficulty the more you gain abilities and not the other way around. And that is partly why this game is frustrating and unique at the same time. But in a great way.\n\nGraphics and atmosphere  Absolutely gorgeous graphics. Everything feels alive. Trees move, wind blows, leaves and dirt kick up and sometimes you'll even see creatures in shadow move in the background. The world of Ori feels very familiar to that of Pandora from Avatar through some segments (which is in no way a bad thing) and completely new in others. You'll be drawn in and awed the moment you first start and all throughout.\n\nMusic The music in this game is so well done that I had to make a segment just for that. The music was done with the utmost feelings put into it. From the soft female hums, to the piano and the orchestrated backup this music touches your very soul and sticks with you. If I were to compare this music with anything it would be the music you'd hear in great anime games like Mabinogi and Final Fantasy. And even that is a bad comparison to the music you'll hear. It fits perfectly with the story and lore and you'll feel happiness and sadness at the same time.\n\nOverall Ori and the Blind Forest is absolutely nothing short of a masterpiece. From the very moment I booted this game up I thought "This is exactly why videogames are an art form". It's an experience I will never forget and will love to replay over and over. I hope Moon Studios decides to one day make a sequel and I could very well see co-op integrated as well (is that too much to hope for?). I hesitated on buying this and I regret I ever did.

Good atmosphere depicts how the environment feels like. Great soundtrack supports the beautiness of the environment. And great artwork shows how much this game worth for you. Oh yeah, and also great mechanics that overwhelms every single flaw (which I believe it actually has no flaw, depends on your opinion tho') exists beneath the ultimate dainty of every element that constructs the beautiness of this system. (Sorry if it's a much of an exaggeration, I'm still learning english)\n\nThe one and only cons you might consider that this game doesn't have what its called a dynamic difficulty adjustment. So from the very beginning of the game, you might want to have an arduous effort in passing through the learning curve of the game. But I'm sure once you get used to it, as you keep playing and practicing, this game will be very enjoyable to you.\n\nIf Spongebob were real, and I show him this game. He will fly up to the Neptune.

Everything about it is a masterpiece, be it's art, soundtrack, or gameplay.\nIt is a plataform Indie game (the debut by Moon Studios) which you play as Ori, and you must free the corruption that set place in a specific night.\n\nAs you play, you can collect EXP points (yellow balls), HP points (the small green ones regenerate your life, while the big ones increase your max health), or Energy points (same with HP points, except now they are blue colored), as you progress through the story Ori learns some upgrades, and for me, the brilliance of the gameplay comes from one of those, I'm not going to spoil anything regarding that here, however if you played or saw the Demo that was out at Gamescon you'll know what I'm talking about.\n\nIn regards to gameplay, Ori and the Blind Forest focus primarily on puzzle solving, it is not your easy game, in fact is a lot harder than I thought the first time I played it. The puzzles must be met with criative thinking, fast reflexes and a throughout understanding of the game mechanics. Certain parts of the game are simply brilliant, the different ways to use the upgrades, the requirement of more than one of them at a time, the usage of the enemies to interact with the environment, etc.\n\nI can not go into detail of sound and art, this game is an experience on its own. You must feel it, from start to finish the game delivers intense puzzles, fantastic gameplay, mindblowing art and music, and great storyline, a "must buy" for anyone that likes plataform games, and even for someone who's not a fan, I garantee you are going to fall in love with it.\n\nI say again, a masterpiece of its genre, one of, if not THE best game of 2015, dethroning AAA games with ease, Ori and the Blind Forest is fantastic.","December 30, 2015","true","9.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

I recommend you to play it whenever you have the chance, you will not regret it. I did not think that I would enjoy this game as I never really enjoyed 2D platformer games.

Going around the map and collecting things is so fun and it feels like it has a purpose.\n\nYou could play Ori in the Blind Forest for hours and will not notice. They have made the gameplay so enjoyable and unique. You can feel the connection between the characters and feel their emotions. I dare you not to cry when playing.

Now for me, 10 hours translates to about 5-8 hours for you, not very long at all. However this game is the embodiment of quality over quantity. People use the word aesthetic in totally unrelated contexts, this is one of those applicable contexts, the world sucks you in and doesn't let you go. Everything from the visuals to the soundtrack works together to make you feel totally engrossed.\n\nMore about what I like in a moment, here's what I didn't like: I didn't care for the story, mostly because there were so many undefined and unexplained terms thrown at you with no context. I finished it and I still don't know why everything happened. This game also has its own version of Navi which, to be frank, I hated. It really takes the mystery out of the experience when you have somone shouting words at you that won't understand anyway. Lastly, there are optional upgrades that let you see all the secrets in the game which completely spits in the face of every exploration game that came before it.\n\nFrom time to time I did get the feeling that I wandered in an area that I wasn't supposed to be yet, which is very good to have. Though you could go wherever you wanted the game still felt quite linear. In fact the whole game felt condensed, every room, every crevace you walked into had a purpose, nothing was wasted. This made it fairly easy to predict where the secrets where going to be.\n\nThe combat was very enjoyable, sometimes there was no reason to fight an enemy but I did it anyway just for fun. Your primary attack auto targets nearby monsters so you can focus on platforming, and another ability you get later completely blurs the line between the two. Moving around just felt great and satisfying, the movement speed is nice and quick, the animations and little flutters Ori does gives you the feeling that it's enjoying itself. Overall a very positive aspect of the game.\n\nNow for some reason the devs have decided that after you complete a save file, you won't be allowed to go back into it for whatever reason. The game will tell you that you completed it and it will become locked. I'm still baffled at why they would do this, now there's even less incentive to go back and replay it. If there wasn't that damn Navi archetype then maybe I would start a new file but I don't want to deal with tons of unskippable text so one is enough for me.\n\nIs it worth 20 bucks? It wasn't perfect but I can't say I didn't enjoy it so yeah, it is worth it.","April 3","true","10.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/261570/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","I've been wanting to get my hands on this game for a little while now. I LOVE a challenge, and I've heard nothing but positive come out of this game. I figured I would pick it up during the Autumn Sale since I had some leftover money. Though at the time of this review, I have NOT beaten the game, I feel I have gained enough knowledge to provide my opinion on the game.\n\nGraphics\nThe visuals to Ori are, obviously, extremely stunning. The "painted" style of video games, especially indie games, is a trend that is usually frowned upon. Along with retro/8-bit graphics, these styles are usually disliked because of how overused they are in games. It's become a recurring trend and it makes indie games just seem like something else to make the Steam store seem bigger even though no one is willing to purchase the game. However, you'll occasionally run into a few that use these generic visual styles properly. Some of these games include Shovel Knight, Bastion, Braid, and now I can add Ori to the list. However, I think of all of these games, Ori actually takes the crown as the most gorgeous game I've played in that category. The entire game is stunning and I was overjoyed to have something to spam F12 at. Everything ties together so well, I would give the graphics alone a personal pick of my reviews worked that way, but, well, they don't.\n\nGameplay\nOri's biggest flaws seem to come from its gameplay. On one hand, the platforming is tight, responsive, and is really exciting. When it comes to being a platformer, Ori does its job well. Timing and quick reactions are key in Ori, and I'm glad for this. I went through a phase back in April of 2014, where I went through and played a LOT of indie games. However, I also bought games that were notoriously hard because I was a self-proclaimed gaming masochist. I love a good challenge, as I said when I started this review, and I think Ori's difficulty is fine to be honest. People complain of "random difficulty spikes" and "unfair gameplay" but I didn't seem to mind those spikes. They were there, but they weren't UNFAIR. It's a metroidvania game, they're supposed to be hard. Being the self-proclaimed gaming masochist I am, I'm used to seeing a challenge, or maybe I haven't encountered one of those spikes and I'm just assuming I did (look at my time played) but I'm still not complaining about Ori's difficulty. I really liked the fact that you could change the pace and difficulty of the game by making checkpoints. Where Ori goes wrong, however, is that I found the combat to be really boring and unexciting. It's clear that combat was not the biggest priority to the game, and that I understand. But in a game like this, it just felt weird and clunky. It dragged and I usually just groaned when there was yet another wave of enemies waiting for me. I also realized that it takes a while for the game to start to get really enjoyable gameplay-wise, despite how amazing the game did its intro sequence.\n\nStory\nPeople have said this already, but it's true. Ori's story is basically one of those really sad scenes in a Disney movie. But I love it this way. It's not one of those stories that literally immerses you and has more lore than all of the Tolkien books put together, but it provides a simple (but slightly generic) plot that was executed really well. The opening sequence of this game is by far one of the most unforgettable moments gaming has offered in 2015. I don't want to spill too much and there's not much else to say, but this story is very depressing.\n\nAudio\nI was really bummed when I saw that Ori didn't take the prize for "Best Soundtrack" at The Game Awards because the game sounded so alive with the music. Forests are full of life and wonder, and this game perfectly captured that feeling as I really enjoyed every single song. There isn't enough voice acting for me to critique that, but the sound effects are amazing and make Ori 100x more adorable.\n\nReplayability\nAlthough Ori is much more open compared to other platformers, I feel that this game doesn't have too much replayability. If you play and fall in love with the game, then I wouldn't be shocked if you played it again nonstop. But this game just doesn't seem like the type that would make me stay until the end.\n\nVerdict\nIn a world where painty/pixelated indie games are taking over gaming, Ori shines brightly. Even if it has a few flaws in the gameplay category, I'm really enjoying my experience with this game and I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to be challenged or enjoys Disney movies. I don't think you'll want apples after seeing this game, just a small word of warning!\n\nGraphics - 10/10\nGameplay - 8.0/10\nStory - 7.5/10\nAudio - 9.0/10\nReplayability - 6.5/10\n\n.:8.7/10:.\n\n+Lively soundtrack\n+Amazing intro sequence\n+Tight platforming\n+Checkpoint system was creative\n+Simple and depressing story\n+Ori is adorable!\n\n-Slow, boring combat\n-Takes a few hours for the gameplay to become really enjoyable\n","December 15, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The beautiful melodies always appear at the right time the story needs it. Ori jumps in the great world, facing unknown fate with his tiny body, dodging flood and larva which can devour him easily, and watching the wayback destructed with shocking music. Only by this can you feel what Epic is.\n++Great level design, especially for escaping from Ginso tree, Gumo's home and Kuro, they are breath-taking, actually with the soundtrack.\n+Multiple choices for completing courses, which meets the acquirements of players of all levels.\n\nCons:\n-You cannot continue your game after the Nibel has been restored, and powerups can be hidden in parts of the game you can never return to. I don't think it should happen in a game with strong collective features.\n-I may say something about the difficulty curve, before the Ginso tree, everything's fine, but the Ginso tree may become nightmare for most players who try the game for the first time.\n--Weak story line, it's a mediate adventure story about our tiny hero grabbing three elements and save the world, I can't figure out the exact character of Ori, and Naru didn't play an important part in the story, either, even in the end, the whole disaster was originated from Ori's leaving from the tree. It's a weird story actually, and it didn't give out a clear explanation for poor Kuro doing things that are contradicting each other.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a masterpiece done by Microsoft, who has showed us that, although it doesn't focus on game designing, however, when Microsoft takes it seriously,\n\nYou WILL tremble at my feet!\nAND SAY MY NAME,\nMICROSOFT!","August 25, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I currently passed it with a GTX 660 and a FX-8350, but the game requires on high end level a GTX 550ti and FX 6100 series. That is quite demanding even for a game like this. I would think some optimizations could have been done, then again not sure on how or where. Just feels like a bit too demanding to those that are still on basic quad cores and GTX 400s. You cannot pass up this game on "Max Settings".","March 28, 2015","true","15.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Including the Castlevania games in the same genre.\nI'll elaborate on that a bit, but I'll start with the most obvious plus; the graphics.\n\nGraphically, this game is a lush, stylized world comprised of countless beautifully painted backgrounds. Each area is distinct and different, and it's immediately obvious that a lot of love went into making the game look good - and I don't just mean 'pretty'. Some areas are distinctly dull, oppressive and dark, while others are bright and cheerful. Some even change from one state to another as the game progresses, giving you a real sense of change as you go from scampering around the overgrowth in a sun-dappled meadow to creeping through the spider-haunted innards of a giant, decaying tree.\nOri and the other characters also deserve a mention, as they are remarkably well animated; Ori in particular moves with such fluidity and believability that I'm genuinely not entirely sure if he's an actual sprite, or somehow some sort of 3D model that's just been sneakily inserted into the game. If the characters and their animations are all hand drawn, then... Well, I have to say I'm pretty damn impressed. It seems like it would be a truly astounding amount of effort to get sprites to look this good.\n\nNext up is the gameplay.\nOri plays relatively simply, but don't expect it to hold your hand, because it won't. Deaths will be frequent, and you should get into the habit of using Ori's ability to quicksave and restore his health as quickly as possible, because you're going to need it. Ori and the Blind Forest is not so much hard as it is uncompromising; It treats the player's intellect with a measure of respect that isn't often seen in modern games, which is both refreshing and periodically frustrating as hell. Ori's difficulty can probably be summed up with "Here is the problem, you have the tools, solve it. Can't do it? Try again."\n\nWithout going into details, immediately after recieving one new power I found myself expected to navigate (in a timed segment!) a maze of high-damage spikes filled with enemies that vomited ranged attacks at me. I also managed to navigate it first try without dying (although not without landing on the spikes), because so long as you can figure out what you're meant to be doing, Ori is mostly extremely fair. It does occasionally run into problems where it isn't immediately obvious what you're meant to do to pass a segment, but these are fairly few and far between. Some segments of the 'escape' sequences are an example of this, but they're also extremely tense and fun to play through, so I don't really mind them so much.\n\nAnd then there's the powers. This is what I meant when I said that Ori was 'better' than even some of the classic Metroidvania titles; while his default attack is weak and fairly boring, the powers Ori can unlock are much more unique, interesting, and in many cases supremely fun to use.\nThe 'bash' attack for example allows you to redirect an enemy projectile while pinging yourself in the opposite direction - both halves of this mechanic are used near constantly, either to redirect an enemy projectile into a barrier or to launch yourself across a gap, or even just to refresh your double/triple jump so you can stay in the air longer while waiting for something else to happen. It's surprisingly satisfying to pull off, especially when you pull off a lightning fast combo to reach a secret area.\n\nMost of the powers in Ori are like this; simple in theory, but put to remarkably fun, clever, or occasionally downright devious use. Several powers also don't fully come into their own until you've progressed far enough into the story, at which point the game world itself changes to unlock a new use for said powers. It's a really fun, imaginative way of adding in new powers that I really appreciate; I spent half the game wondering when I was going to get some kind of super-jump, since there were dozens of jumps that I clearly couldn't make by walljumping or leaping from other areas and I couldn't think of any other way Ori could possibly reach those places - and then when I found out how you actually were supposed to get to those areas, I couldn't help but feel delighted over how unexpected it was.\n\nThe music and voice acting is solid, all adding to the atmospheric and slightly haunting aesthetic the game is trying to evoke. Ori is not a happy game about a cuddly little magical bunny frolicking through the woods; it is far more 'Secret of NIMH' than 'Friendship is Magic'. Players should expect to see death, and expect to see sadness - but also to see hope for a new beginning. The soundtrack captures this perfectly, and the aforementioned escape sequences would genuinely not be even half as good without the excellent score.\n\nOh, and if it wasn't obvious, Ori is also a Metroidvania. A true Metroidvania; in which new sections of old areas are unlocked by acquiring new abilities, not one of the myriad half-♥♥♥♥♥ entries on Steam that claim to be a Metroidvania simply because their game has a dungeon, or a map, or at one point you can get a double jump. This is the real deal, and it's a pretty damn good one at that.\nOri and the Blind Forest is imaginative, unique and beautiful. While on the short side (especially if you're not a 100% completionist - I am, and at just over five and a half hours, I've unlocked 77% of the game) it's still definitely a solid buy for any fan of platforming or Metroidvania games.\n\nAfter reading through my interminable ramblings you should now probably be able to make an educated decision about whether or not Ori is the game for you, but if for some reason you also need an arbitrary number score assigned to this review to help you think: Shinty-six.\n\nOri scores a shinty-six.","April 8, 2015","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The leveling system is interesting and forces you to fully explore the areas that you enter because you realize that energy, health, and spirit are your best friends and the only way to get more is to look in all the nooks and crevices. The spirit trees granting you new powers gave you an excuse to revisit old locations to open up new shortcuts and try to find resources.

Ori and the Blind Forest is one of the best platformers I have played in a long time.\n\nThe graphics are magnificent. The artstyle is really shiny and looks great. There's a ton of visual effects and everything glows and shines. The game is extremely colourful and shows it often. Some people might be annoyed by this many colours and effects, but I enjoyed it.\nThe gameplay is great. Normal platformer difficulty - a small challenge for casual players, a little easy for hardcore gamers. Hidden collectibles that upgrade you, XP from enemies, skill trees that allow you to fight enemies more, find collectibles with more ease or move around the map smoothly. A few puzzles here and there that are not very difficult, but fun.\nThe story is a little short, but it's not really the focus of the game. Still, it's touching and has a satisfying, though cliche ending.\n\nNegative aspects: Three parts where you have to rush through a part of the map very quickly without being able to save at all. Incredibly   frustrating as it's simply repeating the same thing over and over and just memorizing the dangers (Similar to Little Horn from Super Meat Boy).\nVery few visual settings. Only the resolution is changeable with the bonus of being able to turn Motion Blur, VSync and Windowed Mode on and off. People with a bad PC cannot turn settings down to play this at a decent framerate.\nEDIT: Found out that (at least) one of the collectibles is not collectible if you miss it since the area changes permanently. That's quite annoying for people who love to 100% games, like me.

A few days ago, it was announced Ori is getting a Definitive Edition this fall (same year standard version released).  For most games, I'd cry cashgrab. But with Ori, I'm glad.  More Ori for me, and a well-deserved second wind for GotY awards while exposing Ori to a larger audience.\n\nPRESENTATION\nAnyways back to the review.  The presentation is simply phenomenal in all regards. Foregrounds, backgrounds, and animation ALL look amazing.  At times mistakable for something from Miyazaki/Ghibli or classic Disney.  Very rarely, effects and lighting will make it to hard to see yourself, but it's worth it to keep the gorgeous art.\n\nThe music and sound are wonderful, and features several recurring themes.  Whether it be the incredibly upbeat piece during Naru and Ori's adorable fruit gathering adventure in the prologue, or the calming yet thrilling music of the difficult end segment of the Ginso Tree that keeps you going "one more time" for 20 more times.\n\nThe story has a great blend of show AND tell which keeps it exceptionally effective, despite being simpler and getting far less screentime than something like Dust (let alone a major RPG). Usually events are handled extremely quickly, typically within either 5-20 seconds of in-engine events or 1-3 text boxes, then you're playing again.  There are about six exceptions that go on over a minute: the amazing playable prologue, the ending, and about 4 scenes that occur midgame.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay can be described as a 2D Metroidvania, but squarely focused on platforming with some light puzzle solving over combat.  Controls are fast and highly responsive, you press jump and you jump right away. Combat exists, but giving your main attack omnidirectional auto-homing was an intentional choice made to keeps the main focus on little Ori's movement.\n\nMost of the game can be played anywhere from fast and risky to slow and methodical.  However, there are some challenging setpieces, and the first is of those is a forced "rush it or die" situation.  Nothing ever achieves Super Meat Boy insanity, but Ori occasionally dips into the lower end of Rayman's treasure chases.  Luckily, death is minor as you respawn very quickly and an early skill let's you set down your own checkpoints.\n\nNITPICKS-Nothing unforgivable, but worth mentioning.\n1]Certain areas become permenantly locked off.  Meaning an extra playthru to 100%\n2]There is no ingame option to change what buttons do.\n3]The amazing setpiece moments can be brutal on a first playthru.\n4]The voices are not in English and sometimes one voiced word comes out to a full text box.\n5]I'd love seeing Ori in Smash Bros, but as Microsoft published Ori, chances are poor.\n\nCONCLUSION\nRather than simply recreate a bygone era, Ori and the Blind Forest gives us a 7-10 hour glimpse into a world that could have been; a world where 2D never became a bygone in the first place.  When I first cleared the game and the end credts began, I got out of my chair and gave a standing ovation.\n\nRATING\n9/10, VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and the current frontrunner for my GotY.","August 8, 2015","true","38.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It was designed by indie developer Moon Studios and published by Microsoft and released in March 2015 for Xbox One and PC.\n\nThere is a lot of good to say about Ori, it’s beautiful, and touching, but most of all it just plays well. What I am trying to say is that the game is a joy. It may not be perfect, but it’s darn close and it is one of my favorite games released in 2015.\n\nA tale of forest spirits:\n\nThere’s not much to Ori in the story department, but what is there might cause you to get a bit emotional. In fact there is so little to the plot that saying much of anything will spoil it, so… Here’s the basics: Ori is a guardian spirit that fell free from the Spirit Tree during a storm, she was then raised by Naru, the odd, but motherly creature who found her. From there things go badly for the forest and Ori must adventure on to set things right. I can tell you that it likely won’t be the story that keeps you playing the game, but that isn’t a bad thing. It does what it set out to do and does it well, but it’s a simple story at heart. What’s really important is…\n\nHow it feels to be Ori:\n\nThe general structure of Ori is in much the same vein as a classic Metroid game. It’s a 2D platformer, you blast your enemies with homing ‘spirit fire’ and you gain a variety of abilities that allow you to traverse further into the forest. Ori moves very smoothly, the physics are precise and you sometimes might feel you are watching things happen before you remember your fingers are pressing buttons. I have heard some people find the game too floaty, but I most vehemently disagree. This general smoothness of gameplay is only enhanced each time you gain a new ability that increases your freedom of movement, whether it lets you cling to walls, jump higher, or dash through the air.\n\nOri levels up as you gain experience from enemies and cells hidden throughout the map, each level up gives you a skill point to spend on one of three trees. One tree is combat focused, one gives you utility abilities leading to the much loved triple jump and the last (and most disappointing) makes more upgrades appear on your map. Why is this disappointing? Because Ori’s secrets are not hard to find. I am usually the type who needs a guide to find all items in any game, but even more so for Metroid or Castlevania games, but I managed to get 100% during my first run of Ori with no guides and no extra research. You may be disappointed by that, part of the fun in these games is finding secrets, but make no mistake, the series of jumps and ability executions needed to get some of the power ups makes you feel great.\n\nOne sticking point I should mention, and one of the few negative things I have to say about Ori is that you cannot return to dungeons once you have beaten them. This means if you didn’t get 100% in a dungeon you won’t get another chance to. This is exacerbated by the fact that each dungeon generally ends with something of a chase sequence during which you can easily miss something. These chase sequences are likely the most challenging and divisive part of the game, there are those who love them and those who hate them. Personally I am of the former persuasion, these parts were a true test of your skills and all the abilities you have gained thus far.\n\nAll in all I sat down to play Ori expecting something nice, but then I did not stop until I beat it with a 100% completion 11 hours later.\n\nThe sights and sounds of a blind forest:\n\nWhile I can go on about the gameplay forever it wasn’t the first thing to grab me. What was you ask? The fact that the game is absolutely stunningly beautiful. It has perhaps one of the most impressive art directions out there. The style is reminiscent of all your favorite animated childhood movies, and may even pull those nostalgia heartstrings. Every area in the game looks painstakingly hand drawn and perfectly placed. Never do you feel that something is repetitive or non-unique. If you haven’t seen the game in motion yet, do yourself a favour and at least watch a trailer!\n\nI do not want to downplay the soundtrack either, everywhere you go, everything you see, is perfectly exemplified in the sounds you hear. No music feels out of place or poorly done, no sound effect sounds off. I recommend buying the soundtrack.\n\nOri is pure smooth sailing in both the graphics and sound department, I have absolutely no complaints.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nSomething happened after I finished Ori that doesn’t happen to me very often. I dreamed about it, I imagined playing it when I sat in a boring lecture, I kept wishing I could play more of it. Ori has stuck with me and I don’t think it’s going to let go any time soon. It might be a little too easy at points and a little too hard at others, but it never overstays its welcome and you always want it back.\n\nWhich is why I am so excited for the (recently delayed…) definitive edition! I hope to see much more from Moon Studios in the future. These guys have talent, and lots of it.\n\nRecommended if:\n-You enjoy games of the Metroid or Castlevania variety.\n-You want to play a Miyazaki film.\n-You like great games that will stick with you.\n-You are a human being.\n\nNot Recommended if:\n-The chase sequences are going to make you throw your controller… but then you should probably be in a different hobby.\n","January 14","true","11.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

This feels like where games would have been, if 3D had not come and stolen the platformer's thunder.\n\nThe play style is decidedly older school, with a lot of very challenging platforming jumps, respawning baddies, and a good bit of back-tracking every time you get a new 'power'.  Modern touches do help buff the sharp edges off of the formula though.  You can create your own save points (and will likely kick yourself more than a few times when you forget to), and you can tweak how Ori's power grows via a leveling ability point system.\n\nThe real star though is just the absolutely insanely beautiful video and audio.  Vibrant, deeply moving, dark and menacing, celebratory, sad, and much more.  The story is weaved through the world, the music, the silent looks between characters, the brilliant flashes when a major obstacle is breached.  While the execution is not completely flawless (kicking you out of an area you can't back track to if you poke the wrong exit was pretty annoying) really this is absolutely one of the best games I've played in years and I would happily dive back in again just to show it off to someone else.","March 24, 2015","true","13.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Of course as you will expect there are plenty of power-ups and skills, the leveling system and skill tree are simple but fun, every skill really help you out, I mean, there is no skill that you will feel is not worth spending your points in it. You really want all of them, and it keeps you playing and leveling up.\n\nApart from that of course, there is the fantastic gameplay and how smooth everything is put together. Monsters are very well designed, each of them have their weakness but they can deliver high amount of damage to you if you are not careful or approach them with the wrong tactics.\n\nThe 2D world is good, there are plenty of secrets and hidden caves to discover containing more HP, Energy, XP, Map fragments and even skill points. The design of the 2D world and the background are amazingly smooth, sometimes you will not even see Spikes, because they match and blend so well with the background, so you need to be careful out there. The difficulty of the game is just fine, it can be extremely hard at some point, for me that is fine, because I really don't like games that are too easy, specially this kind of games.\n\nWhat I like the most is the game saving feature, it is well implemented, I think that is a great idea to save the game using energy, that makes a challenge too because you can create your own checkpoints, but at the same time, you can run out of energy and not be able to save your game for a while until you recharge your energy, so you need to think how to manage your energy carefully.\n\nUnfortunatelly, there is a annoying bug in the game, that can cost your save data, and you may have to restart the whole game, that is why I don't give this game a 10/10. Regarding the bug, you can search here in the steam forums how to solve that, there is a player fixing save files at the moment, but no official word from the developers yet as far as I know.\n\nScore: 9/10\n-------\n\nPros:\n------\n\n-Great 2D art, excelent graphics and sounds/music.\n-Good controls, at least on gamepad.

This is seriously one of the BEST recent games I've played. I didn't know much about this going in aside from how simply gorgeous it looks, and for $20 I figured I'd take the plunge. Man, I'm REALLY glad I did.\n\nOkay, so first off, you're going to notice that the art is, bar none, the most beautiful looking thing ever. I want to say that it kind of invokes a Ghibli sort of feeling, but that's not really doing it justice because that doesn't even begin to explain it. The whole world seems alive with its painted style. Colors are vibrant, sounds are immersive, and oh my GOD the soundtrack is moving.\n\nIt really helps out the story, too. The tale is emotional and well-presented, really doing a good job of tugging at the heartstrings without feeling too cheesy or tryhard. It isn't a particularly ORIGINAL story, to be fair, but it's just executed so well that it doesn't matter. All of the characters work really well, especially the antagonist. You really get a sense of dread and panic every time this giant black owl swoops down. It's crazy.\n\nGraphics and story aside, the game controls amazing. Moving and jumping around feels awesome, and each new upgrade you find makes you want to go back over everywhere you've been just to see all the new things you can do. Progression is smooth, and you can explore the game at your own pace or try to speedrun and probably have fun regardless. It's not an EASY game, either. Unless you really know what you're doing, prepare to die a bunch. It's not much of a problem, though, considering that you can save at any time just by holding down the corresponding button, assuming you have the required energy. You die, you're dropped right back where you last saved without missing a beat.\n\nThat being said, I DID have one problem with the controls. There's a ground pound move you can do by jumping and pressing down. Fairly standard, I like the ability, but it felt like it was a bit too sensitive. I found myself dying more than once because I was holding a direction at a slightly downward angle, causing me to fall right into traps and get frustrated. I never stopped playing because of it, though, so it's not really that big of a deal.\n\nAll in all, this was an EXCELLENT buy. The price is logical and you'll get a lot out of your money with this.

The unique and gorgeous art style left me staring at the scenery several times, along with the character design, incredibly detailed animations and the wonderful soundtrack.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, controlling very well along with upgrades that add a lot of motion and variety in combat. A lot of the upgrades are fairly basic things always seen in your usual metroidvania platformers, such as wall jumping and double jump, but their implementation is done very well, giving full control to the player and along with the great level design and a good difficulty curve, allowing for some challenging moments that do not feel unfair for most part. The few sections where you get no checkpoints can be a bit annoying, as you need to react fairly fast and often it just ends up being trial and error, although there aren't many of these sections and they provide a good challenge. The main problem I had in combat was just that sometimes, things would get fairly hectic and flashy and it'd be difficult to tell what is dangerous terrain and what are enemy projectiles, and what is safe. This didn't happen often enough to matter much, though.\n\nThe game has a mechanic where it allows you to place save points at your own will, at the cost of some energy. Early on, you need to be a bit mindful of where and when you place save points, as your energy stock isn't very high and is also required for other things. But as soon as you get a few more Energy Cells to upgrade your maximum energy, you'll essentially be able to save as often as you want, which takes away a bit of the difficulty. But as you choose where to use these save points, along with some of the experience upgrades that can help with the cost of the save points or even make them heal you a little bit, it's up to you how challenging you want it to be.\n\nThe experience/leveling system is fairly basic. You can get upgrades that assist with your damage, or upgrades that help gathering collectibles, or some other miscellaneous ones. If you try for 100% completion, you'll probably have almost all experience upgrades, if not all of them, by the end of the game. I finished the game missing a single upgrade.\n\nThe map is quite large, but the world and its areas connect very well, letting you traverse from one corner of the world to the other fairly quickly, especially as you gain more upgrades. This is really nice if you go for 100% completion, as you won't be wasting all that much time backtracking to get to previously inaccessible areas. Collectibles include the basic things - Maximum health upgrades, energy upgrades and experience points. As they are fairly simple items, revisiting areas is only really worth it if you're having some difficulty or if you're going for 100%.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with the game is related to this aswell, 100% completion - Two sections of the game are inaccessible after you complete them, so if you missed anything in them, no matter how little, 100% completion may become impossible. In addition, once you finish the game, your save file is locked as "completed" and you can no longer return to it, forcing you to restart the entire game if you missed anything. The game does warn you before you enter the final section, that there is no return after entering. However, there are no warnings for the other two sections and the point which they become locked also sort of comes with no warning or indication. This left me with around 96% completion all around, which was a little disappointing once I saw I could no longer access my save file.\n\nOverall however, Ori and the Blind Forest was an incredible experience, and is definitely one of my favorites of the metroidvania platformers genre, and perhaps one of the most visually pleasing games I've ever played.","March 14, 2015","true","7.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It doesn’t stop him however from getting rather devious and mean to the player right off the start. The trial and error approach which the game is based upon overwhelms you at first. A new character death happens faster than you would’ve expected from a game which desperately tries to look like a Disney animated feature with a touch of Studio Ghibli’s design and mystique. Everything is dangerous and kills our hero instantly with one attack punishing for a single mistake. Sharp spikes, flying aggressive thingies, crawling aggressive thingies, thingies spewing glowing bombs  will kill you mercilessly and send you to the most recent checkpoint which you created yourself with the same energy that can also be spent on you most powerful and helping in “oh ♥♥♥♥” situation attack.\n\nAnd this creates an interesting resource management dynamic for a while. Should you keep it and see a little more or should you spend it right here right now so you won’t have to respawn far behind and re-do all that painstakingly hard jumps again? Of course you should do it now like any sensible person would! Problem is, that it stops being a problem after a while, as you progress through the story guided by glowing arrow on the world map pointing to where you should go next for things to happen: like gaining a new ability from the list which inevitably includes a double jump. Curiously enough you can turn that into a triple jump with leveling up of one of ability trees, though it won’t be really necessary. Otherwise how you would be able to get all those items hidden in the backgrounds or placed in previously inaccessible areas. “So many secrets” the game tells you through its achievement notification. Sadly that it doesn’t mention all of them containing only three types of glowing orbs, which you don’t really need after some initial leveling up. The main difficulty that persists throughout the game is a challenge of speed jumping puzzles which are using your newly acquired mechanic.\n\nGoing back to the previous locations as the side activity can’t really compete with going on with the story; you run back to the already visited area to just use that recently got ability in a challenge that is fairly trivial compared to the ones you just did during one of those this-is-it-run-or-die-sections, and, well, while it doesn’t hurt you’ve already lost count of your energy glowing balls and you probably don’t really need that another one; it would’ve just unnecessarily lengthened the already not that compact experience which this game wants to be at heart. This unnecessary increase affects the story which in compensation tries to be more vague than it should be, making the narrator speak in an artificial language and immediately translating all his lines through subtitles with a fairly generic lines of not that inventive a story.\n\nWhat I’m saying is not that cheesy stories with cheesy endings don’t work, because otherwise I wouldn’t love Pixar movies. Maybe they aren’t that stretchable to 12-hour-long format even if they are so beautifully looking, and sounding, and being adorable.\n\nSteam doesn’t allow to post the review without choosing Yes or No. I’d rather choose funny.","June 23, 2015","true","12.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

While technically there's a narrator speaking through parts of it in vague, riddlish sentences, it still represents a superb example of showing rather than telling.\n\nThe game does not simply rest on some status as an artistic, classic-gameplay adventure though. You may have heard mentions that the game is hard; I don't rank it among Super Meat Boy's levels of masochism, but unique platforming challenges and coordination are some of the staples of its gameplay. This would be a lot more annoying were it not for an inventive checkpoint system; you can essentially save anywhere by using up one expandable "Energy" point; as a Metroidvania, there are also true save points that refill both your health and Energy. I really hope for the difficulty not to put people off; at the very least, it will make those reward moments so much sweeter when you finally escape the flooding of the Ginso Tree.\n\nEvery room in the game always seems to have the detail of a painting; the fantasy wonder of a game like Trine, but seeminly almost all of it hand-painted instead of 3D (many times, it's hard to tell the difference!) With some of the game's more cinematic set-piece moments, it's almost hard to fathom the kind of work that went into the visuals. You could pretty much hit the screenshot button at any time and have yourself a new wallpaper.\n\nOut of the storytelling, animation, soundtrack, challenge, and overall cinematic presentation; Ori would be a highlight of the year for mastering just *one* of these elements to the degree they've managed. Had I known what I do about this game prior to buying it, I easily would have accepted a starting price of $60. As it is, Moon Studios simply seems to have a whole lot of artistic vision that they now want to share with the world.\n\nI have not even finished this game yet, so for all I know I might have more praise to share about the ending. I'm almost certain they'll manage another tearjerker on par with their prologue.","March 23, 2015","true","9.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

Not only is the platforming immensely creative, but it delivers a heartfelt and intelligent story that is sure to tug on your heartstrings.\n\nThe game follows the story of an orphaned spirit creature named Ori, who sets out on a journey to revive a forest who loses it's life sustaining light. It only took 10 minutes for the game to get me emotionally invested and I enjoyed every second of it thereafter. The classic Metroid-vania formula is done well here, but it's high peaks and most hectic and intense moments will put Metroid escape sequences to shame.\n\nMy only minor gripe with Ori and the Blind Forest is that, after a while, the save mechanic becomes too generous. I died 203 times during my first playthrough, but many of those deaths came from me trying to rush through some difficult sections because I could save so often. I rarely felt the need to carefully plan my next move and exercise patience when I didn't risk losing a lot of progress. Just as long as i remembered to save often, I didn't mind dying all that much, and that should never be the case.\n\nBut Ori and the Blind Forest gives you a great sense of mastery and accomplishment and the difficulty progression is done extremley well. It's an 8-10 hour experience that left me satisfied and it's a game well suited for speedruns, and I wanted to dive right back in once the credits rolled.\n\nThis is one of the most impressive Indie titles I've seen and it is a must own if you like platformers!\n\nScore: 9/10","September 17, 2015","true","11.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Where Rayman lacks, namely story, it shines, while not being that far behind gameplay-wise.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's beautiful. The art is stunning, the music is wonderful, and overall it's very pleasing to all the senses.\n\nGameplay is the area where it's hard to assign a single score.\n\nAll areas are one huge seamless level and it's great, because it makes the world more real. It isn't static, it evolves as the game progresses. There're many interesting areas with fun gameplay. In one area, the ground keeps changing. In another area, gravity force changes direction as you move. But most fun parts, at least for me, are escape sequences where you have to run away from something or someone chasing you very quickly. They remind me about some levels of Rayman or Fly'n.\n\nOn the other hand, killing very similar enemies which respawn the moment you move off-screen is annoying (in some areas more than in other, often enemies can just be skipped). Backtracking through the whole map to collect new items, because you can reach more items with a new ability, is annoying. Not being able to replay certain areas is annoying (will be fixed in the Definitive Edition). However, most players are unlikely to encounter all this — no one forces you to collect every single item or explore 100% of the map.\n\nThere aren't any innovations, but it isn't something I'm after when I'm playing platformers. What really matters is fun. And there's plenty of it.\n\nThe game is difficult just on the right level — you'll never hit a wall of difficulty, but the game expects you to get better at playing over time, to learn new skills, to perfect your moves. Expect to die a lot, especially if you aren't hardcore player (I'm not).\n\n(removed text)\n\nNevermind, the story is touching. After playing five or so times, it still gives me goosebumps, so complaining about little details at this point is absolutely silly.\n\nFor those who care, achievements are good. Some are story-based, some are collection-based, some are skill-based, and some are extremely difficult which very players can complete.","March 13, 2015","true","43.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","1"

Beautiful visuals, stunning soundtrack, and tight gameplay combine for an experience that calls back to the classic 2-D greats such as Super Metroid and Castlevania.\nThe various areas are all visually distinct with lovingly crafted visuals and interesting mechanics. Movement is solid and fluid, with lots of different upgrades to reach new areas you couldn't reach before. Some of the game sequnces are absolutley mesmerizing.\n\nThis game doesn't necessarily break any new ground, but what it's doing is a complete refinement of the mechanics we all know into what is, in my opionion, the must-play game of early 2015.","March 15, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A fast paced exploration game that will keep you on your toes and tug at your heartstrings while delivering a very strong package of gameplay and beatiful setting. This game is more than an art game, much more, and delivers with impact. Well worth the asking price.\n\n----------------------------\n\nWith little story, strong gameplay, and beautiful work in music and art, this game delivers a strong package for such an unknown title. Honestly I heard nothing of it till the day it was released, and when I started playing it, I was surprised I hadn't heard of this sooner. It hit me much like Dust did when I first tried it.\n\nA heartfelt story that will tug on heartstrings for those who like the emotion of the light story will be hit at the very start. The story is light, but very intwined with the entire game. Starting off as meek, with only able to move, you'll feel very vulnerable through the start, but as you progress, you'll start to feel truely progressing through the story. Like a castlemania game, you'll backtrack often to use your abilities to explore hidden spots you missed, but be warned, be diligant in explorations as some sections will be cut off from you as you progress, so if you're a completionist, be ready to explore every inch.\n\nHowever its more than exploration, every area will keep you on your toes as elements of the place will push you to use your abilities. However, don't be discouraged by this 'Super Meatboy'-esque style, as the game has a evenly paced learning curve, and manages to keep itself challenging without going into maddeningly hard, leaving you with satisfaction for completing an area, without missing a few patches of torn out hair. There will be moments you feel every second, every motion, every direction you take matters, and to a point, its what makes the game so thrilling, only to slow down, giving you a moment to breathe so you can explore.\n\nAudio and visually stunning, the art and music are two elements in this game that jump out at you instantly. The amount of work that went into both will grab you the moment you start. Thankfully the Devs didn't make it the only priority of the game, but they did put extra care in making it all stand out.\n\nAll in all, for the asking price, the initially unassuming game delivers the quality you want at a $20 game and perhaps a little more. Well worth the price.","March 15, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a really enchanting and loving story. The music is fantastic and the hand drawn artwork for the visuals (graphics) are breathtakingly beautiful, as is the animation.\n\nWhen I first played this game though it seemed very slow. Character movement seemed difficult, but once the game fully starts, the controls are very accurate and movement is almost fluidic.\n\nIt is a very beautiful game and I have just come to the first hard puzzle. As with most platform games, you always need a few tried to complete a task, this game is no exception and if you are not a platformer, you may struggle a little until you get the hang of things.\n\nNot very often I give high scores for games, but this one so far deserves 10/10.\n\nRecommended: Yes, very highly.","March 20, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In my recommended games Ori and hte blind forest popped up. I looked at some reviews and thought: screw it it looks gorgeus lets get it!\nWell ♥♥♥♥ me if this isnt the best impulse buy ive ever done. This one goes on the list with Transistor,Bastion and Dust:an Elysian tail for most epic indie games. You know those games that give you this sad feeling when you finish them? Like finishing a great book and wondering what to do with your life now? I need more.\nPersonally im not a platformer but daaaaaaamn this one is good.\nThe controls are great, the puzzles are challenging but not impossible and the graphics man.\nThe graphics are made out of three layers: The front, The place youre walking and jumping on and the background. All of these layers are animated and textured, ive cought myself looking at the background and dying because of it.\nThe story is nice as well.The intro is very cinematic and beautiful and there are a few cutscenes to be found in Ori, but most of the story is told by the little light that server as your guide or a big deep voice that acts as a narrator. This never breaks immersion though, it always fits well within the context.\nIts short though,  i finished it in 9,4 hours (i did play a bit linear and not 100% completion mode) and leaves you very hungry indeed.\nI kinda with they had a  soundtrack DLC for this game because the music is awesome. It gives you this lovely fantasy night forest feeling and i love it.\nIm reading my review and im thinking: sounds a bit bland doesnt it? Im finding it difficult to express what kind of feeling this game gives me. Expect the feeling of MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE. This is a game that shows that video games can be an art form.\n\nTL;DR:\n+Challenging but not impossible\n+Gorgeous graphics\n+Gorgeous music\n- Short\n- No soundtrack DLC\n- At 20 bucks maybe a bit expensive for its length but i have no regrets","April 7, 2015","true","11.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I am usually not one to make reviews of games but this game truly deserves it.\n\n\nHow does it look?\n\nIt does look amazing and the graphics are just great. When i first got into it, it felt like a combination of a gorgeous painting and an animated movie (If you can describe it that way). There is so much to see and there is so much variation in the terrain.\n\nThe animations are also wonderful and especially for cute little Ori :3 but also for the surrounding vegetation which makes everything feel more alive when you pass through the forest for example. There is always something to look at and it's beautiful.\n\n\nHow is the sound?\n\nIt is among the most beautiful music in a game i have had the pleasure of listening to. The composer has done an amazing job and has a certain theme for every area. At one point of the game it was so challenging that i got pretty frustrated and was about to leave the game for some time till i had calmed down, but the music was so good that it kept me playing till i beat the challenge.\n\nOther sounds also adds to the atmosphere of the game as the different noises in the jungle, the splashing when Ori dives into the water or the deep breath she takes when she comes up above the water surface again. All in all, the sounds are relaxing, realistic, cute and atmospheric.\n\n\nWhat about gameplay?\n\nThe gameplay is fun as it is challenging where you have to think to solve puzzles but it also feels rewarding. Like most games it gets harder as the story and Ori progresses and the game will not autosave for you so always remember to SAVE! LoL.\n\nIt also has the ability tree where you can spend your ability points that you get through killing enemies or finding special items. Im glad that there is an ability tree in the game as that makes the player free to choose what upgrade Ori will get next.\n\n\nWhat do you think about the story?\n\nThe story is also something very nice about the game as you immidiately get feels for Ori in the beginning of the game. One of the reasons that i bought the game was because of the feels i got when i watched the intro of the game on YouTube. You know it's a good game if it evolves a connection between you and the character.\n\nYou get to see some small parts of lore when you scout the wilderness and as Ori continues on her quest, but as i am one who likes lore a lot, i think there could be a little more to it. Like notes/pictures that some of the habitants in this world would have scratched down on rocks, trees, anything just to give you some extra detail of the world's history or just some short sidestories to read.","March 18, 2015","true","20.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm with Maximilian- this is my personal GOTY. A really superb example of narrative, artistry, and game design combined in a small but impactful package that takes roughly 6 hours to beat, maybe a little more if you plan on doing a 100% run. The storytelling is very simple but emotional, the art direction is vibrant with colors with incredibly smart design choices in lighting and perspective, but my god, the gameplay is what brings it together. Super tight controls with the awesome power progression of Megaman and Metroidvania-type games with level design that is both fun and rather challenging--but not impossible with practice!

But these were fixable.\n\nOther than that. . . Ori and the Blind Forest is one of the best 2D- platformers I've ever played with it's artistic look and wonderful soundtrack that makes you feel so immersed. I'm so inlove with this game. I recommend this all the way.","June 22, 2015","true","19.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

She adopts you and they live a happy life with each other until a cataclysmic event makes the forest and its food supply wither and it is up to you, to return balance to the forest.\n\nGameplay: (9/10)\nOri and the Blind Forest is set as a 2D open world platform game. You control Ori, a guardian spirit through his quest to return balance to the forest.\nThe controls are easy to learn and precise, which makes it easy and fun to travel around the open world.\nDuring the game you'll learn different abilities (for example: shooting spirit flames and doing a ground stomp),\nyou'll need these powers to interact with the environment  and to solve the different puzzles throughout the game.\nThe game has save points scattered around the map (that heals you when you save at their location) but you can also save at any time in the game by creating a "soul link" but these can only be created using energy cells collected during gameplay.\nThe cost of creating a ''soul link'' is not too high, but it forces you to create them only when necessary, at least early in the game. You also use these ''soul links'' to buy various perks and upgrades for Ori, such as underwater breathing and increase the spirit fire damage. Each skill must be bought in sequential order from one of three trees to allow the next, more expensive skill to be accessible.\n\nLevel Design: (10/10)\nThe levels in this game are beautiful and creative and in my opinion the best looking 2D game I've ever played.\nThey are filled with secrets you can find, some secrets will be out of reach only to be accessible when you have learned the required ability giving you a reason to return to already explored areas.\n\nVisuals: (10/10)\nTo be honest, the visuals were the main reason I bought this game. I loved the art style from the moment I saw the first screenshot and I regret nothing. This game is an aesthetic masterpiece and is the best looking 2D game I've ever played.\n* The Levels are beautiful and varied.\n* The backgrounds are stunning.\n* The visuals has a cartoony feel, but still have realistic undertone.\n* The characters are nicely drawn and animated (and ADORABLE).\n* The lighting adds that little extra making the environments look and feel more alive.\nSo it doesn't matter if you are an artist like myself or not. I can almost guarantee you will love the visuals of the game :)\n\nThe Soundtrack: (10/10)\nSoundtracks for me are important in games, it has the job to enhance the story and events within the game and Ori and the blind forest really succeeded on that part.\nThe music is so intertwined with the story and does a really good job in setting the scene, whenever it is calm, sad or intense the music will hit you on the right spot and make you emotionally invested in the game and its story.\n\nSo what is my verdict?\nI loved this game, the gameplay was solid, the story amazing, the music and the visuals godlike.\nI had a blast playing through this game and I will do so again, so I will give this game a 10/10!!!!!\n\nIf you haven't bought this game yet, I highly recommend you doing so. It's a well made game and a joy to play through. I don't think you will be disappointed :)","October 25, 2015","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The platforming is superb, you move quickly and have fluidly. I would compare this game mostly to the new Rayman game, having similar artsyles and nearly identical movement. The only flaws i can see so far is that all the projectiles in the game have no indication of them being projectiles, and blend in with pickups like health and experience, and i often time get hit by something i didnt even see. Another thing i didn't quite enjoy is that alot of the traps in the game are instant death. When you die you respawn instantly to the last waypoint you set, and you can set enough of them to save after every puzzle or challenge. The only problem is, i usually dont save everytime i enter a room, and run forward to hit an unskippable cutscene, to be instantly killed 2 seconds later and now i am all the way back to where i began. The cutscene plays every time, and some of the instant kill traps are very hard to dodge. Some instant kill traps didn't even look like a trap, and i ended up running into it and dieing after clearing a frustrating challenge only to go back and redo it. The only solution is to get good which is not a bad thing at all. The story is nothing to write home about, but its enough to get the job done. Its hard to get a good story where isn't a focus on speech, but there is one nonetheless, and it is not a bad one at that.\n\nTLDR\nPros:\n-Quick, fluid, easy to learn movement and platforming\n-Amazing art\n-Orchestrated Soundtrack (although alot of it is ambient)\n-Challenging Gameplay\n\nCons (very minor nitpicks):\n-Instant death traps\n-Hard to see projectiles\n-Unskippable cutscense","September 29, 2015","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is like nothing I've ever played. The world has many different areas that are handmade and a joy to be in. They introduce new mechanics and abilities that interact and open up new possibilities allowing you to explore further. The story is perhaps the most moving I've ever felt... The world, music, gameplay, and storytelling combine to create a really great experience. This game entered in my list of all time favorite games within a few hours of gameplay, it's that good. It's obvious that Moon Studios dedicated a LOT of time and effort into making this the best it can be, and I hope to see more tales from them in the future.\n\nTo me, a game should be more than just a game. It should tell a story, and bring you in to another world. This accomplishes those criteria and is incredibly fun as well.\n\nI use a keyboard for most games, for this one I reccomend a controller. Sit down, relax, and have a great experience.","July 25, 2015","true","24.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Seriously, if you're on the fence, go watch the prologue. Having said that, I wouldn't consider it a 10/10 gaming masterpiece like some people are calling it. Maybe an 8, or 9 at best.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty standard metroidvania platforming type stuff, but it's done well. There's about 6 hours of it if you take your time and explore stuff. It's not super hard like some people are saying, just challenging enough to be interesting. The controls flow pretty well.\n\nStory is simple but decent. Pretty emotional stuff, but a lot of that has to do with the way it's presented. Which brings me on to the strongest elements of the game...\n\nThe soundtrack and sound design are amazing. Everything sounds great and a lot of the atmosphere comes from the background music and sound effects. The artwork and animations are also phenomonal, some of the best I've seen in a game. There were a lot of moments where I just stopped and thought "holy ♥♥♥♥, this game is beautiful." I do have one gripe though, and that's that they use too much bloom. It'd really look better if they toned it down a little in a few areas. I even lost track of my character a couple of times 'cause of all the glowy ♥♥♥♥. Not a huge deal, just a shame because it's otherwise a visually perfect game.\n\nAnyway, good game, buy it, you won't regret it whatsoever","March 16, 2015","true","20.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/takalol/recommended/261570/","takalol","Takalol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/takalol/","484 products in account","tl;dr its gud.\n\nThe game draws deep influences from old time metroidvanias such as Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and mixes them with some newer games with more palpable gameplay elements for lesser complexity. Aquaria is probably another huge influence on this game, both artistically and gameplay-wise.\n\nEverything related to the gameplay mechanics is pretty solid within the game, the player is easily able to grasp what is supposed to be a puzzle or not, and it's easy to notice if you are able to solve it at the time, or if you need a newer power to solve it later. The game is pretty solid, with 1 big world map, the player has a lot to explore, and the powers the player gets have great influence over the world itself. You feel more powerful as you get more upgrades for your character. And also, nothing feels too easy or too hard, everything is suited for a balanced overall experience. The only flaw within the game is the combat system, it is not as solid as the whole platforming, level design and doesn't help the fluidity of the game sometimes, with some burdening and annoying enemies that halt your progress for some seconds if you don't deal with them, and dealing with them doesn't feel interactive.\nThe soundtrack and sound effects are superb, similar to Child of Light's soundtrack most of the time, but still unique, helping ambients in the game feel different, and apart from each other, each with its own theme, and each cutscene with its own music, sound cues help the player many times, and none of them are too awkward or annoying.\nThe art direction is amazing, the level art is incredible, with unique aspects and props for  each level and part of the world making it easy to tell apart one place from another. The character design is excellent.\n\n\nThe story. The story is exceedingly good, overwhelming, so many unexpected plot twists, it is something that picks the game from others, the story is unique, and very well written, its pace is rock solid, easy to understand, out of this world. The main characters are also very significant to the whole story, none feels wasted, and you can feel the life within the forest.\n\nOverall, it is a huge piece, an instant classic with all of the elements deeply connected into each other, the game is rock solid and if you don't enjoy it, then there's something wrong with you.\n\n9.5/10","September 19, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/261570/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Ori and the Blind Forest is a 2D Metroidvania game starring Ori, a ridiculously cute glowing animal with big eyes and long ears. Heavy on style, this game has a very strong visual style to it, with excellent-looking environments and enemies and allies that fit into the style of the world very well.\n\nAccompanied by Sein, a ball of light which represents the last spark of the Tree Spirit’s power, and whose voice is strongly reminiscent of Navi the fairy from Ocarina of Time, Ori is tasked with restoring the wind, water, and fires for the forest to revive the Spirit Tree before the woods die for good.\n\nThe narrative is woven into the gameplay, but while the narration (spoken in a nonsense language, translated to English on-screen) works well enough, only the prologue really blows you away. At twelve minutes long, it is kind of pushing it as far as intro cutscenes go, even if you can technically “interact” with the environment in meaningless ways, but it does an excellent job of setting the emotional grounds for the rest of the game, even if the character we end up bonding with isn’t the one we spend most of the game trying to save (which is rather unfortunate, given that I cared much more about them than I did about the deep-voiced Spirit Tree). Still, it made me want to see more, and while some of the later cutscenes are of reasonable quality, they’re just not as good as the story at the start of the game.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it works great. The controls are tight, the abilities you acquire over the course of the game are mostly used in interesting ways (with one kind of lame exception), and the gameplay brings together all your abilities in natural-feeling ways to make exploring the environment of the game-world a fun and enjoyable experience. The environment are interesting, both visually and technically, and there are a reasonable range of challenges, including offbeat gameplay elements in the first two “dungeons” in the game, with the third and final dungeon being sort of a recap dungeon that tests your ability to use your abilities to the fullest.\n\nThe overall progression in the game feels mostly natural – you get your abilities, and your new abilities allow you to visit new areas. But more, your beating the dungeons actually changes the world environment in significant ways which further your ability to explore. The first dungeon cleanses the water of the world, letting you swim around the environment, while the second produces updrafts of wind in certain areas which allow you to fly using your parachute ability. Both of these follow naturally from the themes of the dungeons, and they both feel like they have real repercussions in the game world, furthering the game’s theme of restoring the forest to life.\n\nThe enemies, too, are mostly pretty reasonable, though unfortunately the variety on them does begin to wear thin after a while. The game is about ten hours long, but you encounter all of the enemies in the game before you even reach the final dungeon – indeed, you may encounter them all before you even enter the first dungeon, if you go out of your way to explore as much as you can. While they do a pretty good job of exploiting the game mechanics, after a while they do start to feel a little repetitive rather than fresh. Still, the environments tend to be novel enough that this isn’t a huge deal.\n\nThe secrets are decently hidden – there is no guidebook necessary to find them, as you can unlock the ability to reveal them on your map, or even visually on-screen. Some of them are kind of a bit boring to get back to, involving boring backtracking to just use one new ability somewhere, but some of them are well-hidden at the end of miniature mazes, and those feel rewarding. These secrets unlock more health, energy (used for a couple of your abilities – including the ability to create save points anywhere, which can also be used to restore your health somewhat), and improved versions of your basic abilities on your skill tree. There are enough that they feel interesting to find, but not so many that they’re onerous to collect; even still, the “find all the secrets” achievement is a bit dumb, because there are some secrets which are not revealed on your mini-map from unlocking your skill tree.\n\nThis sort of minor design oversight shows up a few times in the game – one of the achievements just plain old didn’t work for no apparent reason, and none of the dungeons can be revisited in order to collect secrets you missed, which is kind of annoying if you’re a completionist type.\n\nThere also aren’t really standard “boss fights” in the game – while there is one monster that serves as a boss about three times over the course of the game, it isn’t a tough thing to defeat and doesn’t feel like a boss so much as just an unusual, rare enemy which is unusually hardy hit-points wise. Around the point of the first dungeon, the enemies in the game stop really feeling very threatening, especially once you unlock the ability to take half damage from all hits, and the only real dangers you confront are the platforming sections, and a few things which cause instant death.\n\nThat being said, the game is still quite challenging; the game tracks how many deaths you have, and I racked up a whopping 172 over the course of the game (though admittedly, some of those were deliberate self-deaths to quickly restart a platforming section or to avoid losing a bunch of health to bramble bushes I landed in and having to waste time healing). Your ability to save anywhere that it is safe to stand means that the game has very forgiving checkpoints, but woe betide you if you forget to save. Still, it is very cheap to save, and thus you’re likely to do so constantly – and the fact that you can unlock the ability to heal yourself when saving makes this all the more useful.\n\nApart from introducing the player to new environments, the other place where the game is strongest is a few timed platforming segments. When you complete each of the three dungeons in the game, Ori must escape the building before it falls apart/floods/erupts. These timed sections require you to quickly navigate through a new environment, sometimes while still nabbing secrets en route (and if you miss them during your run, you’ll never get them, ever), while the world falls apart or floods behind you. If you don’t move fast enough, you’ll die. There is also a segment where you must hide from the Big Bad of the game, a gigantic owl who wants to kill you and all the light of the forest, which feels almost like a stealth section as you have to move from cover to cover quickly enough to avoid making the owl swoop down on you and eat you. The final sequence of the game is a combination of these two things, with the owl on the lookout for you and the level falling apart behind you, resulting in a very frantic rush to escape.\n\nThese sequences are by far the hardest part of the game, are likely to result in numerous deaths, include no checkpoints, and really test your ability to use the game’s controls to their fullest while under pressure. While a bit frustrating, they’re also challenging in a fun way, and while a checkpoint might not have been amiss partway through them, they still work well enough for what they are.\n\nOn the whole, Ori and the Blind Forest is a good game, but not a great one. It has some flaws, but its overall quality makes you want to forgive it for them. You generally have fun going through the game, and the platforming challenges feel fresh and challenging. At about ten hours long to get 100% completion, it isn’t so long that it wears out its welcome, but isn’t so short that you are left wanting. It is a complete experience at its length, and it was worth the time and money I spent on it, even if, despite having beaten the game, I still don’t understand in what way the forest is blind.\n","December 1, 2015","true","14.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The first five minutes consisted of me being a sobby mess, but let's skip that part.\n\nIt's been years ever since a game touched me like this one did. I think last time was Okami, and Ori is comparable in a few ways: amazing visuals, unique and breathtaking art style, gorgeous soundtrack, all on top of a challenging and fun game.\n\nIt feels like every screen, every little bit of this game's scenario could be a full painting. It is truly a magical, fascinating world to be in. The mood changes perfectly according to every area or scene, as well as the music score. The ability tree system is exciting and rewarding, and the game also rewards you for being curious and exploring your surroundings. The only "complaint" I have is that it had to end. I could play many more hours of it - but there's always a new save file, right?","July 15, 2015","true","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The platforming is superb, you move quickly and have fluidly. I would compare this game mostly to the new Rayman game, having similar artsyles and nearly identical movement. The only flaws i can see so far is that all the projectiles in the game have no indication of them being projectiles, and blend in with pickups like health and experience, and i often time get hit by something i didnt even see. Another thing i didn't quite enjoy is that alot of the traps in the game are instant death. When you die you respawn instantly to the last waypoint you set, and you can set enough of them to save after every puzzle or challenge. The only problem is, i usually dont save everytime i enter a room, and run forward to hit an unskippable cutscene, to be instantly killed 2 seconds later and now i am all the way back to where i began. The cutscene plays every time, and some of the instant kill traps are very hard to dodge. Some instant kill traps didn't even look like a trap, and i ended up running into it and dieing after clearing a frustrating challenge only to go back and redo it. The only solution is to get good which is not a bad thing at all. The story is nothing to write home about, but its enough to get the job done. Its hard to get a good story where isn't a focus on speech, but there is one nonetheless, and it is not a bad one at that.\n\nTLDR\nPros:\n-Quick, fluid, easy to learn movement and platforming\n-Amazing art\n-Orchestrated Soundtrack (although alot of it is ambient)\n-Challenging Gameplay\n\nCons (very minor nitpicks):\n-Instant death traps\n-Hard to see projectiles\n-Unskippable cutscense","September 29, 2015","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I bought it simply because of the ratings it received a few days after it was released. The screenshots looked spectacular as well, so I was expecting something pretty amazing.\n\nAfter completing the game, I can say without a doubt: this is the most refined, most polished, the deepest and certainly the most beautiful platformer I have ever played. And I don't think there's any game quite like it.\n\nThe game immediately lets you know what you're in for: a charming story set in a surreal fantasy world that looks absolutely incredible. And while the story is not at all complex or long, it's exactly what it needed to be to satisfy me. A lovely tale of love, friendship and loss that will make you weep occasionally. At first it may seem a bit black and white (good characters are good, bad characters are bad), however in the second half of the game, you realize that this is not the case and the story earns even more respect.\n\nThe visuals are simply stunning. They fit the mood of the game perfectly and manage to draw you into the world even further than the story did. Combine this with the incredible music and you have a game that never loses your attention. You could honestly just look at the screen and listen to the music and it would still be a worthwhile experience. Not only that, the world feels incredibly varied. You'll visit many different places and all of them will have a different mood, music and visuals. And they all feel incredible.\n\nAnd what about the gameplay? It's fantastic. There's a ton of different mechanics for you to use (double and triple jumping, shooting, bashing, climbing walls, swimming, gliding, slamming on the floor, power jumping off the walls and many more), and sometimes obstacles can approached in more than one way, making the game feel more varied. There's even three skill trees for you to put your skill points in, so you can decide what you want to do. And there's no real obligation for you to invest in one specific skill tree, you'll be fine with picking the first thing the game offers you. The controls are ever so slightly stiff, but honestly it doesn't matter too much as you'll get used to them quickly.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning about this game is its difficulty. I personally believe that this game is just slightly too difficult to be enjoyed to its full potential. Most of the time you won't have any problems, as the game has a great saving mechanic, but there are a few sections where saving is prevented and you have to beat the entire section without dying (specifically the escape sections). These can be frustrating at times, but the feeling when you finally beat them is worth it. Like I said, it's just SLIGHTLY too difficult, you'll still probably enjoy this game far more than many other games.\n\nThe game has very few other issues. For some reason if I Alt-Tab the game, I get a weird graphical glitch happenning, but it's no big deal. Sometimes, the voiced sections repeat the exact same thing that was said an hour ago, but with different subtitles, and I guess the Bash ability is kind of wonky and hard to aim sometimes. But these errors are so minor  they don't actually affect the game in any significant way.\n\nAt 20€, this game is an absolute steal. The moment the game was over I was in tears (stay until the end of the credits and you'll se why) and I knew that the price was worth it. If you want a platformer that is incredibly polished, looks amazing and makes you cry, look no further: this is the game you've always wanted to play.\n\nIf I had to give it a score, it would be 9,5/10. And I've only played a few games that deserve such a rating. Playing Ori and the Blind Forest is truly an incredible experience. Hats off to everyone who participated in the making of this game, your game is an unrivalled masterpiece. Not just in the world of platformers, but in the world of all video games.","March 24, 2015","true","87.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's obvious that Moon Studios dedicated a LOT of time and effort into making this the best it can be, and I hope to see more tales from them in the future.\n\nTo me, a game should be more than just a game.

Only real downside is the fact the story is not the most developed thing (it was going for a moreso interpretation deal, and platformers generally have underdeveloped stories), but the main point is that the gameplay and visuals are solid.  Probably the best platformer I have played in a while.  The game will not patch till like early-mid May 2015, so basically I would hold off buying it because people have had issues running the game, but all in all this game is a 100% reccomend from me if you like platformers, especially metroidvanias.  A word of warning, this game is a tad bit hard at times, easier than stuff like super meat boy but harder than stuff like mario basically, its still fair as long as you respect each area and proceed with relative caution.  The worst part about this game is that it feels so short, but the experience probably would get worse if they stalled the ending for the sake of making the game longer.  The only bad things I can say about the game are needlessly nitpicky since it is just general flaws of the genre, no game can be perfect, but Ori is pretty close for me.\n\nTL;DR\n~9/10\nPros\n+Looks good (literally random screenshots are good wallpaper material)\n+Fun and rewarding to play\n+Fair difficulty\n+Amazing world to explore\n+Soundtrack is pretty good\n+Gameplay is the focus of the game\n+Good replay value\n\nCons\n-Game is short\n-Not the most accessible game, appeals to a more specialized audience, platformer fans would like this, hardcore action is not the focus of this game\n-Story is not as strong as you would expect, but still good enough for what it is\n-CAN be unstable, uncommon but still in the realm of possibility for the game to not work, will be patched soon though","April 21, 2015","true","23.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My personal game of the year, despite putting 200ish hours into Rocket League and other games. I can't remember the last time I was so impressed by the first 15 minutes of a game,\nThe entire atmosphere this game creates just sucks me in; needless to say I lost track of time during my play sessions. The orchestral tracks are beautiful and haunting, with the art style consistent and very pleasing to the eye. Numerous times I would just stop and soak in the minute details in the graphics and level design while letting the music wash over me. Around every new corner is a potential desktop background just waiting for a screenshot.\nWhile the story is somewhat simplistic, it is told in an emotive way that shouldn't fail to incite these emotions within the player. Controls I found responsive and intuitive, it was a joy moving around the world. The few more challenging sections I didn't mind, as the checkpoint system is forgivable as long as you remember to actually make the checkpoint. Overall I found the difficulty just right, but if you get stuck in one of the longer sections it can take a while to get through, and there's no way around it.\nHolding off a second playthrough until the definitive edition comes out next year; if I could have the chance to go into this game again blind I absolutely would.","December 23, 2015","true","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/261570/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","There’s a million things I could complain about in Ori and the Blind Forest (and I will), But I still kinda liked it. When the graphics, music and the general mood of the game is this pleasant, it’s hard to get too angry about anything.\n\nBut to start the complainathon, the enemies suck. 70% of the fights in the game are against blobs. You fight blue blobs, yellow blobs, red blobs. There’re other types of enemies too, but the most common is a blob. Combat mostly involves you standing still and maybe moving a few pixels to the side to avoid projectiles. It feels more like RPG combat than something you’d want in a precision platformer. I’m just speculating here, but it feels like the boring enemy design was a consequence of the amount of time it took to create and animate each one to this level of fidelity. The four main characters in the story look good, but there are no big enemies or creatures, outside of the primary antagonist. The enemies work best when they’re used as part of puzzles, which is thankfully their primary role later in the game.\n\nMost of the work seems to have gone into making the world itself. In terms of artwork the levels all look either great or amazing. But for the first half of the game I felt it was holding back too much, which made it feel like I was going through the motions. Later on it got much better as the level design becomes more complex. But there are so many other platformers out there which have already done the same things Ori and the Blind Forest does, so I found many of the challenges to be bland. When you’re doing things like wall gliding, double jumping, anti-gravity and so on the game doesn’t raise the bar in any way. It does the most obvious things everyone else has already done, outside of one thing, which is the “blast” ability. With this skill you can use enemies and projectiles to hurl yourself in any direction you want. It’s the one good idea the game had of its own, and it does liven things up a bit.\n\nBy far the most annoying thing in the game is the chase sequences, where you do several challenges in rapid sequence. I guess the intention was to make these as exciting as possible by throwing tons of hazards into the environment. But the result is that you have so little time to react, and there are so many hazards on screen, that you go into a trial and error cycle, slowly getting closer to the end with each retry. There are no checkpoints during these sequences, which had the effect of wearing me down mentally as I was getting closer to the end. After one of them, I just felt numb. There was no sense of victory, as the price to get there had been too high. This is how soldiers felt in WWI. You have to be lucky in order to breeze past on the first or second attempt. Given the style they chose for the visuals and story; I wish the developers would’ve made it easier.\n\nWhen it comes to the story, I liked the idea of it more than the execution. The opening scene does a great job of tugging on the heartstrings. But after that it goes off the rails. For what the story tries to do, it’s too thin in what is expressed during both game and cutscenes. Most of the time cutscenes only tell you what to do next, without there being character development, or foreshading or anything. That’d be fine in a different game, but Ori was aiming for more, and falls on its face. There are plot twists which feel totally unearned as they aren’t set up properly. At one point I started to feel disconnected to the story as I didn’t understand what was happening. It’s all “go here, do this”, without adequately explaining WHY. When the last cutscene played, I wasn’t buying into what was happening at all. It's the dramatic highlights of a good story, without the actual meat of it.\n\nBut I’m not going to blame you if you like Ori and the Blind Forest more than I did. A lot of people seem to have. For all my complaints, it’s “fine”. I was just hoping for more, especially since it sometimes got very close to being great. Oh well.","February 13","true","8.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Its stunning beautiful 10/10 graphics, great and thrilling 10/10 story combined with really awesome feeling controls and physics and phenomenal music make this game a true masterpiece.","January 3","true","28.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unlocking new areas with new abilities is fun and there is plenty to explore. But jeez, can this game be nutwrenchingly annoying. Especially with the sequence where you have to timely avoid iceshards and geysers and whatnot. I wanted to pound my keyboard into my desk... so unfair and unforgiving without any saves in between. So, must-have? I guess, if you like platforming action where you will die a LOT. Really, sometimes 10-20 times in a row. It takes the fun out of it a bit for me personally, I think it's rewarding when you make it finally but at what cost? Visually it's stunning and the music is pretty awesome, you can tell a lot of care went into this game!","January 2","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My personal game of the year, despite putting 200ish hours into Rocket League and other games. I can't remember the last time I was so impressed by the first 15 minutes of a game,\nThe entire atmosphere this game creates just sucks me in; needless to say I lost track of time during my play sessions. The orchestral tracks are beautiful and haunting, with the art style consistent and very pleasing to the eye. Numerous times I would just stop and soak in the minute details in the graphics and level design while letting the music wash over me. Around every new corner is a potential desktop background just waiting for a screenshot.\nWhile the story is somewhat simplistic, it is told in an emotive way that shouldn't fail to incite these emotions within the player. Controls I found responsive and intuitive, it was a joy moving around the world. The few more challenging sections I didn't mind, as the checkpoint system is forgivable as long as you remember to actually make the checkpoint. Overall I found the difficulty just right, but if you get stuck in one of the longer sections it can take a while to get through, and there's no way around it.\nHolding off a second playthrough until the definitive edition comes out next year; if I could have the chance to go into this game again blind I absolutely would.","December 23, 2015","true","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In terms of graphics and sound, this game is incredible and really immersive. You have this cutesy, almost Disney-like art style coupled with a very melancholic soundtrack. It really fits. Story is really about preference and I'm not going to spoil it, but personally I liked it. To give you an idea, I was getting some pretty intense Studio Ghibli vibes.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it's essentially a platformer. For the most part enemies are pushovers and you have an amazing number of tools to deal with whatever enemies you come across. You can bounce back projectiles, slam enemies dash through them, or even just scale the walls and avoid them alltogether if you happen to be low on health.\n\nAll in all I heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys platformers to some extent. Ori was very refreshing and one of a few platformers I've ever really enjoyed. That being said, Ori will probably last you about 6-7 amazing hours for a single, slow paced playthrough.","July 18, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cherrio16/recommended/261570/","cherrio16","Cherrio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cherrio16/","151 products in account","(This is a review I made for my college newspaper if that helps with all the explanation I had to give into this review.)\n\nOri and the Blind Forest by Moon Studios is a canvas of colors that are in constant motion, where the animation will take the breath right out of you and the story will have the plater thinking about the true definition of friendship and family.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest starts out in a storm that is buffeting the grand, life-sustaining Spirit Tree, and a quite magical leaf is blow away to land in the forest the Sprit Tree looks upon. The leaf, turns out to be a cat-like creature by the name of Ori. Ori is found and taken in by the big and fluffy Naru, who raises Ori as her own. The two live a happy and joyful night until one night the Spirit Tree is corrupted by an unknown presence which leaves the forest “blind” and in a decaying state.\n\nIn the state that the forest is in, food becomes hard to find for both Naru and Ori to survive on their own. Naru has always put Ori first ahead of herself, and gives Ori the last piece of fruit she finds before passing away in her home, leaving Ori to fend for himself in the Blind Forest. With everything Ori cares about is at stake, he meets the spirit Sein and sets off to restore the Spirit Tree to its healthy state and save the magical forest.\n\nI found myself to having a very fun time while playing this platforming game, but with fun, difficulty also came around to smack me right in the face. The game’s calming and refreshing music of piano, winds, and strings helps relieve that stress of playing Ori and bring me back into a cool-headed space. I never wanted to stop playing this game. The music and atmosphere kept dragging me into a peaceful state. The music in this game is none other like I have ever heard in any other game.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest is mainly classified as a metroidvania game, a genre of 2D platforming action games where the abilities are picked up as you progress through the game and backtracking to past areas is strongly encouraged. Ori can be compared to the game Metroid in a sense: with complex, winding network of passages, each containing hidden areas, challenging platforming puzzles, and harmful projectile-spewing enemies. Ori captivated me into exploring the entire map early on in the game, but I found this to be a minor flaw in the game where such openness lead to pointless excursions to areas I was not supposed to be at yet. Towards the middle of the game, by luck, I found myself at the entrance of the final dungeon way before I was supposed to be there, I had to turn back around and avoid dying as I escaped without the abilities I was supposed to have acquired to reach this area with.\n\nOri’s abilities in this game really amazed me as progression made my character much more powerful and able to reach heights not previously reached. The basic attack is a simple barrage of homing projectile-like powers, which can be made faster and stronger through the game’s ability tree. I was only a little disappointed that I was not able to discover different types of interesting projectiles from Ori, but without a true aim system in the game, Ori can focus on fun abilities such as double jumping, wall jumping, smashing into the ground, climbing, floating, swimming and dashing.\n\nWhat I enjoyed the most was the dash move by far. The ability is triggered near an enemy or projectile, and you get a moment to point an arrow in any direction. Ori is flung in the direction of the arrow, and whatever object or projectile was being dashed through will shoot towards the opposite direction. It can be used to fling enemies aside, move them towards their death, shoot their own projectiles back at them and can be used to travel through the open air. In the late stages of the game, I was able to chain dashes with wall-jumps, double jumps, triple jumps and past one-shot killer lasers and explosive projectiles. It made me feel invincible, even though many of those attempts came with multitudes of deaths.\n\nThe places where I would die the most where in Ori’s boss fights, which actually weren’t consider a “boss fight” in itself. These sections of the game had me moving through platforms and enemies on a non-stop motion or dying in a miserable attempt. In this trial-and-error design, death was an opportunity to concentrate and focus on what errors you might have made in order to learn the minimum necessary requirements to overcome the challenge Ori puts in front of you.\n\nHere’s the thing about Ori and The Blind Forest. Performing well in the game feels amazing, because this is not an easy game. Ori does not guide you by the hands and spoon feeds you the solution to all problems. It’s about precise timing and reflexes. Even the simplest interaction with defeating common enemies involves second-to-second decisions beyond just “shoot the monster.”\n\nThe difficulty in Ori is further enhanced by making quicksaves as a resource. Ori is able to use his limited pool of energy to make save points in the Blind Forest, and over time more and more energy can be earned, which means saving can come more often. But the same energy pool used for saving is also offensively used for charged attacks to open up paths and destroy harder enemies. Planning and conservations comes into big play here. This can all be tracked though the simplistic HUD (heads up display) which shows ability level progress, energy orbs and health. The design is well made and does not get in the way of the overall gameplay or is a bother at all.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest is a rare indie gem full of fantastic designs and outstanding production values. Characters in the game each stand out and leave a memorable impact to the player. The music and art style of the game is of magnificent value. With the eight hours put towards this game, I would love to be able to come back to it very soon once the now released DLC (downloadable content) for Xbox One, released last week on March 11, comes out for PC. Ori and the Blind Forest is a spectacular game that I believe everyone should experience and hope they receive the same feelings I had towards this game.","March 14","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's easily one of the best video games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. I bought this on my Xbox, my PC, gifted the game to seven friends on my Steam account, and bought the soundtrack twice. If that doesn't tell you how much I love this game, then I don't know what will.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nThe game is beautiful. Ten years from now, we'll look back on Far Cry 4, Battlefield Hardline, and Crysis 3, and say to ourselves, "Yeah, they looked pretty good." Ori, however, will stand the test of time. Every single frame is like a painting, vibrant and beautifully drawn. If someone ever makes the damning claim that video games aren't a form of art, then I want you to show them Ori, and prove them wrong. There's not a single dull area of the game. Everything looks and feels alive in a way that no other game does.\n\nMUSIC:\nThis is easily my favourite part of the game. Every track is memorable. You will start humming along with the tune without even realising it. Some tracks are filled with action and adventure, pumping you up for the next area, some are deep and emotional, and to this day, almost a year after first playing the game, they still bring tears to my eyes, and yet others are powerful, like the epic scores you'd hear in a high-budget movie. This is the best soundtrack ever made. You absolutely CANNOT play this game without buying the soundtrack.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nOri and the Blind Forest does everything perfectly. Animations are smooth and detailed, the game is incredibly responsive, and with every new stage, you'll earn a new ability that makes the game infinitely more fun. That's the best part of the game; as you progress, you get more fun abilities to play around with that enhance the experience ten-fold. I've played this game so many times that it's become near-muscle memory, and it's still just as fun and magical every time. My record for finding every collectible and completing the game is now 5 hours, and I'm sure I can make it even faster with more practice. While it doesn't have specific difficulty settings, the game is truly brutal. Managing your resources and finding collectibles is tough, but trust me, you'll need all the help you can get. This metroidvania platformer isn't going to hold your hand.\n\nHowever, for the PC version specifically, I've encountered two issues: first and foremost, there have been several (not many, but several) areas in the game where I noticed brief moments of low frame rate. I have a rig that can run Crysis 3 at max settings and still pulls off 80-90 frames per second, so the fact that this game has ANY dips in frame rate for me is absolutely mind-boggling, especially since my Xbox One never had any frame rate issues, and that's only about half as powerful as my PC. Luckily, the frame issues are few and far between, but still hard on the eyes after so much time spent playing such a smooth game. Second, the controls are dreadful. This is the first PC game I've ever had to use an Xbox controller with. It's unfortunate, because I love to play with a mouse and keyboard, but because you're unable to map controls, I found it nearly impossible to play without a controller.\n\nSTORY:\nThe game has a compelling, and shockingly emotional narrative. Never before has a game so easily ripped out my heart and smashed it into a million pieces. Few games have managed to make me feel emotionally connected to what I was doing at all, and of those few, they were in a series of games, such as Mass Effect, Halo, or The Witcher. This game plays with your emotions in literally the first ten minutes. It has the strongest opening to a game that I've ever experienced. It's unforgettable and beautiful in a way that words can't describe, and finishing the game after everything you go through feels like the greatest accomplishment you've ever achieved.\n\nVERDICT:\nOri and the Blind Forest is a game that rivals any Triple A title released in the past several years. As much as I love The Witcher 3 and Fallout 4, they simply fail to captivate the same kind of incredible feelings that come with playing Ori. With a story that assaults your emotions, gameplay that's fluid and beautifully exectued, despite slight dips in FPS and an inability to map controls, music like no other, and artwork that you'll never forget, Ori and the Blind Forest not only takes place as my game of the year for 2015, but one of the greatest video games ever made. For the people at Moon Studios, I want to say, bravo for making your first game one of the best experiences I've ever had. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's about time I save the forest of Nibel for the twentieth time.\n\nRATING:\n9.5/10","December 29, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I cannot recommend it enough.\n\nPositives:\nBeautiful Visuals\nAmazing Soundtrack and Sound Design\nExcellent Platforming\nMetroidvania Exploration\nSurprisingly Good Story\nNegatives:\nEventually The Game Ends\nYou should be aware that, depending on your skills at challenging platforming games, you may hit a rather large difficulty spike about 1/3 through the game.  Don't panic!  The skills you acquire getting past that part are essential for the rest of the game.  Although I was momentarily frustrated, I never felt like the game was cheating me.\n\nYou should probably also know that, even though the beginning of the game might seem easy, this is game where you will die a lot; however, like Super Meat Boy, you get right back to the action very quickly, so it doesn't feel like a drag.\n\nMy first play through, without any guide or knowledge of the game, took me about 5 hours and 30 minutes, and I died over 200 times.  I have since completed the game 3 more times, playing different ways to get different achievements.  I'm currently working on my 5th playthrough.   I very rarely play through the same game multiple times, but Ori is so good, I just didn't want to put the game down.\n\nSeriously, Ori and the Blind Forest really is that good.

It runs noticably smoother besides Unity's own shenanigans.\n\nI've been hyped to play this since it's debut at E3 2014. Thank God it wasn't an Ecksboned exclusive.\n\nReally good Metroid-Vania game, plus some MM/Rockman elements, including the walljumping (MMX) and instagib beams and surfaces. The Bash move is pretty new to me though, and quite fun - I also like how physically accurate it is, exchange of energy (not just velocity) and all that. Other than that all the abilities are well implemented and quite inspired. All of them see good use well into the endgame, besides the basic "gun." No speedbooster, but the powerful shinespark-like properties of superjump take its place quite well.\n\nThe sprite layering is bad af, especially how it cascades to reveal other portions as if it were a model (but it's not), the progressively changing world hearkens back to Metroid III and then some, and the music is really good, although I'm more of a breakbeat/techno kind of guy (EDIT: I bought it. My review is on the respective page for the DLC). Overall the entire world was really nice. Even at 1080HD I was able to get like 50+ frames at normal combat portions (normally I have to go windowed and lower the res because of my aged rig), and the zero-framedrop nature of the renderer gave me friggin bullet time during high-intensity events like escape sequences, but it beef'd my cutscenes.\n\nEDIT: After playing it again, I'm seeing just how detailed the layering even is. Like, we're talking at least seven to twelve layers per region. Moon did not ♥♥♥♥ around with the deets.\n\nThe game is just full of very well-designed environments, obstacles, and puzzles. Some absolutely require you to think outside the box.\n\nMy beefs are:\nYour basic weapon can't be manually targeted using the mouse or right analogue stick\nCan't remap controls\nYou can't use the bumpers as well as the triggers for their respective uses (I have a Logitech F310 and it makes my fingers hurt because of how many pounds the triggers require)\nJumping with an object requires absolute accuracy at a certain part in the wind temple or you'll drop on the spikes or that stinkin' cannon. There is no room for error.EDIT: On that last note, if you have triple jump you can skip this part in it's entirety. Go to the big platform in the middle, jump, glide, bash, jump again. Easy peasy; in fact, you may not need tri-jump at all.\n\nAll of the above can be lampshaded or compensated for somehow. While you cannot remap controls, the gampad setup was well though-out.\n\nEDIT: A note to add is that I felt the game to be a very refreshing change from the usual VS stories, along with certain gameplay changes like the utter lack of boss fights and the fact that escape sequences do not have checkpoints, which, honestly, reminds me of Descent 1&2, because if you beef it while the reactor is going critical, the matcen for your ship won't work and all your goodies are bathed in a funeral pyre.\n\n9 outta ♥♥♥♥in 10, honestly.

Everything about this game is beautiful: its graphics, its sound design/soundtrack, its gameplay and its characters.\n\n✓ Challenging\nIf you get Ori and the Blind Forest thinking you're in for some relaxing casual fun, you're in for a world of pain. It starts softly, but the difficulty escalates and escalates until you find yourself thinking out loud "holy **** are they ****ing serious?".\n\n✓ Engaging\nI'm not gonna say it's addictive, because it's not. This is the kind of game that you play on the couch for a couple of hours, ragequit and play it again some other day when you're more cool headed. It's not the kind of game that makes you say "this is ridiculously hard, I give up"... you'll get stuck but it will be engaging enough to make you come back and keep trying.\n\n✓ Lovely story\nWhat can I say? The story is worth it. At first it's about finding yourself, and then it becomes a journey to cleanse the forest from all evil.\n\nVerdictI have no cons for this game. It's a ride from start to finish, and one of the best platformers I've ever played. One of the most special things about it is the fact that there is no difficulty setting, so it will be hard at first but not-so-hard once you've learned the mechanics of it. Ori and the Blind Forest is a must buy for platformer lovers and those who are looking for a challenge.\n\nEdit. ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥ game it's too ♥♥♥♥ing hard.

Not just "boohoo, that was sad" tears either: full on, choking on my tears, ugly-crying-face, "why is life so awful?" tears.\n\nThe story is as moving as it is light-hearted, and aesthetically the game is superb. The music complements everything perfectly, tying it all together (possibly one of the most beautiful soundtracks for a game ever?), and adds to the fantasy-feel of the game. The controls and new abilities are easy to master, but not so easy as to make you feel like you're playing a kid's game either. I initially bought this game thinking, "Well, this should be relaxing to play" - and it was! ...except for the parts where I died about 100 times trying to do one thing. One particular escape-scene left me with a stomach ache and shaking hands when I'd finally managed it (I only died 170 times trying, so no biggie).\n\nI suppose the only thing that bugged me a little at the end is that you can't go back and try to collect all the items you missed along the way, but that's just a small quibble.\n\nOverall: a beautiful, well-made, immersive and amazing game, that will have you wanting to play it again and again. 12 out of 10 - just astounding.","June 23, 2015","true","21.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cardare/recommended/261570/","cardare","Cardare Anbraxas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cardare/","256 products in account","After completing Ori and the Blind Forest I can say with absolute certainty that it's 'one of those' games, and by that I mean it's easily one of the best games I've played so far this year. For a Unity engine game, the controls are perfect and require a good degree of mastery to 'get' how the bash mechanics work, which you'll have to pick up fast if you want any hope of getting through certain parts of the game without dying.\n\nThe art style makes any screenshot you see of this game look like art in its own right, but in real time, everything moves. The cutscenes are in-engine and mesh perfectly with playable events: sometimes you don't even notice it's your turn to take part in the story by how well it does this.\n\nThe sound design is possibly the strongest example I've seen where the sound completely integrates with the game, and allows you as the player to relax where no sense of urgency is required, and forces you to the edge of your seat when events unfold and require you to perform at your best in order to get out of a sticky situation. Kuro, the not-so-friendly owl not only comes across as formidable, but fearsome and impossible to even contemplate ever attempting to take on, and her cries and screeches have you desperately scrambling using every skill you've learned to get out of her way. Amongst all the other things going on, she comes out clear as day to let you know she's coming, she's coming fast, and she's coming to kill you.\n\nAs for gameplay, this is a hard game. You'll die, a lot. As I said above, you'll need to master all the abilities you learn if you have any hope of getting far in this game, and sometimes the puzzles will have you completely perplexed as to how to get around them. Ori controls brilliantly, and the game responds to you extremely fast, a given considering some parts of the game require you to be precise with your movements as you scale the forest from its marshes to it's very peak.\n\nI'll admit that the difficulty in some areas might put some off, but the sense of relief you get from clearing them is worth the effort (and the many deaths). Is it worth the price tag? Absolutely. I couldn't fault this game in any places, and the only thing I'll say is that the gorgeous artwork doesn't always help you find your way, but I think that is partly the point. You are exploring a place you've never been to before, no one has ever traversed. There are no arrows to help you navigate, and sometimes you have to think out of the box to get around. There are many senses of accomplishment to be had here, and they are all yours for the taking.\n\nI have no problem recommending Ori and the Blind Forest, especially if you're in to metroidvania-style titles, or even just to get sucked in to a world that has been painstakingly perfected from art to sound to control. I'll be keeping a close eye on Moon Studios from this point on.\n\nEdited: Just a quick mention on the story front as I didn't earlier but didn't think I needed to. While there is a story it is minimal, and very remeniscent of Disney of old which is a good thing: It's not the length of the story that is key, but how it unfolds. The story is not told to you, but shown through the very heavy use of animation that would make anyone a fan of animated movies glow with glee. Ever felt like you wanted to leap in to the screen and help a loved character in trouble when watching any Disney movie when you were a kid? With Ori and the Blind Forest, you have that power and it feels awesome.","March 14, 2015","true","26.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Animations are really fluid as well. And the music is so beautiful, it keeps you going and going while wiping on the harder parcour parts instead of ragequitting. Bastion finally has a contender here for best soundtrack! :)\n\nThe gameplay can be challenging at times, which is a good thing. Completing certain chapters are really satisfying once you finally complete them. You have to be very precise in your movement in most cases.. and the timing on Bash can be crucial in situations of life and death! And whoever designed the dungeon where gravity plays a huge part, is a genius. Favourite part of the game hands down! Frogs on the other hand..\n\nThere's also leaderboards implemented, even for speedrunners! I haven't seen many games do this yet, and it's so awesome to be able to track your time against others without the use of external sources. Big +++ for this!\n\nOne of the only negative things I can think of right now is that once you complete a playthrough, you can't play in it anymore if you wanted to get all the collectibles. It does make sense story wise, so warrants for more playthroughs if you were eager for achievements! ;) Oh yeah, achievements. Whoever can legit get the Immortal achievement, even though they're most likely inhuman, deserve all my respect.\n\nI haven't tried playing with a keyboard yet, but I can tell a controller is probably the best choice to experience this game at its best.

Its abilities mostly focus on exploration and platforming over combat, though a skill tree system does give you the opportunity to build toward your preferred play-style. As you progress in the game, backtracking becomes very fluid, fun and rewarding on its own. They really nailed the mechanics, which makes exploring this world very rewarding. They managed to turn enemies and their projectiles from obstacles to opportunities, and in doing so created a great risk-reward system.\n\nYou can probably see it for yourself, but this game is gorgeous, and the music is simply perfect. If running around wasn't rewarding enough on its own, the audio and visuals take it even higher. And then there's the story/setting, which really does need to be experienced. The first 10 minutes alone are a beautiful emotional rollercoaster, but even as the game gets going it never stops hinting at details of this very interesting setting and driving you toward your goal. As the overarching story slowly pieces itself together it weaves a sad but beautiful tapestry in very few words. It would have been so easy to mess up on the story side of things, but they really nailed it.\n\nThe only gripes I have with this game are fairly small ones. There are no difficulty options, which means low-level players will find a few challenges pretty frustrating, and high-level players have no challenge mode or options to make it tougher other than picking up fewer items or not upgrading their skills. My only other issue is with an area of the game which doesn't allow you to return once you've completed it. There is no way to revert back a save, so if you move into the final room in one of the game's three "dungeons" then you'll trigger an event which autosaves before you leave for good. Tying 100% completion to collectibles you can permanently skip is a bit of a taboo in this genre. I normally try to 100% my first run on these games, but unless you're having an especially tough time, you might want to leave that for subsequent playthroughs.\n\nBut hey, Ori is such a perfect game, there's no way I can leave it at only one playthrough. I would try to unlock all the achievements as well, if there wasn't one for beating the game without dying.\n\nFinal score:\nIf you like video games, play this video game. 10/10, and that's not a score I'd throw around lightly.","June 22, 2015","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Animations are really fluid as well. And the music is so beautiful, it keeps you going and going while wiping on the harder parcour parts instead of ragequitting. Bastion finally has a contender here for best soundtrack! :)\n\nThe gameplay can be challenging at times, which is a good thing. Completing certain chapters are really satisfying once you finally complete them. You have to be very precise in your movement in most cases.. and the timing on Bash can be crucial in situations of life and death! And whoever designed the dungeon where gravity plays a huge part, is a genius. Favourite part of the game hands down! Frogs on the other hand..\n\nThere's also leaderboards implemented, even for speedrunners! I haven't seen many games do this yet, and it's so awesome to be able to track your time against others without the use of external sources. Big +++ for this!\n\nOne of the only negative things I can think of right now is that once you complete a playthrough, you can't play in it anymore if you wanted to get all the collectibles. It does make sense story wise, so warrants for more playthroughs if you were eager for achievements! ;) Oh yeah, achievements. Whoever can legit get the Immortal achievement, even though they're most likely inhuman, deserve all my respect.\n\nI haven't tried playing with a keyboard yet, but I can tell a controller is probably the best choice to experience this game at its best. This goes out to those having trouble with the lack of rebindable keys, although I do understand your pain!\n\nSo yeah overall a super big recommendation to play this game, you're missing out if you don't!","March 12, 2015","true","31.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

How I wish I knew of it when it came out.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest has changed my life. I'm not even kidding. This game has swiftly become one of my favorite obsessions. The artwork is simply stunning, the music is captivating, and the story is one for the ages.\n\nSet in the forest of Nibel, the Spirit Tree unwinds a deep plot of destruction and demise as the forest around him begins to die without his essences. Ori, an orphan from the tree, is found and cared for by a loving mother figure called Naru. Slowly, the forest around them begins to wither and die, and only Ori can restore life.\n\nThis game is wonderfully designed. Gameplay-wise, it follows the traditional formula of many Metroidvania-style games of platforming, defeating enemies, and unlocking upgrades to your power and health, as well as finding new abilities along your path.\n\nThe story does not take very long to complete (It took me roughly 10 hours to finish), but it is one that will leave you wanting more. I heavily anticipate the release of the Definitive Edition, which adds in more areas and more abilities, as well as backstory on Naru.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest should be at the top of every list of PC games that must be played. Coupled with the visual and audio brilliance, this game does not fail to deliver a memorable experience for the player.","April 15","true","14.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

At most times if a game is "eh", I give it a thumbs down only to expression (which I have) that's a thumbs in the middle type of game.  Ori is one of those games.\n\nPros:\n*Beautiful Graphics\n*Fantastic Soundtrack\n*Tight control (except for jumping - see cons)\n*Short but fun 'metroidvania' type of game.\n*Crazy chase scenes which are the 'bosses'\n\nCons:\n*Very short for this type of style game (under 10 hours)\n*No real boss encounters, however the insane chase scenes make up for it.\n*Control is NOT fluid when it comes to jumping:\n-- and there are A LOT of those.  You'll encounter crazy complex jumps and you feel you made the jump but you really didn't.  This is where Ori fails to be a fully recommended game in my book.  Nothing is more frustrating than stiff control or bad camera angles!  It's almost not satisfiying in the end when I finished some of the crazy complex jumps.  Folorn Ruins -- I'm speaking to you!\n*Not much of a story - there's a story but it's your typical "Metriod" story not much to go with but it somewhat reminded me of Shadow of Collosus which was cool.\n\nFor pros and cons me and friend could agree this is similar to Alice 2:  Great graphics and music but the game play not so much.  I recommend this game for $10 or less anything more (especially if you hate stiff controls when in terms of jumping), might not be worthwhile.\n\nOh and to those who got the no death achievement.

You need to dodge your enemies and often times use their attacks against them, and it is done so smoothly I am honestly impressed.\n\nStunningly beautiful, The reason I bought this game was out of impulse just based on looks alone, I had seen it pop up in my recommended for you list and took a look, and it was awesome, I'd taken another look, saw it was a platformer with a good story and bought it right away. It looks fantastic, no more I could say about it.\nCons:\n\n-Lack of Knowledge, If you werent paying attention to a cut scene, you can kiss 10 minutes goodbye wondering where to go next. This game has a lot of problems with the lack of indication on where to go, which some might argue promotes exploration, but regardless it can get to the point where its just frusterating.\n\n-Combat again, I said combat was good, but only for your character, AI are often predictable, which some would argue are necassary due to the use of combat to complete areas in the game.\n\n-Difficulty spike, When playing the difficulty ramps up from very, VERY easy down to ludicrus levels. The final area I spent a solid 10 minutes on, due to the low timer that I had to complete that area, and a lack of indication on what to do.\n\nSummary:\n\nIn all I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a platformer, or a good story, but you'd better pay attention, or you may get lost.","March 14, 2015","true","26.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Ori and the Blind Forest is a stunning platformer. If you even remotely like the genre, you should seriously consider picking it up. I will elaborate on why you should below.\n\nFirst things first, this games presentation is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. If I had to describe how it looks, it has a highly detailed, hand painted, magical and surreal type of concept art look. The aesthetic reminds me of another metroidvania game (Dust: An Elysian Tail - which was also a gorgeous game in it's own right), but with a dash of Studio Ghibli and maybe some Pokemon thrown in. The sound-track is also phenominal, mostly orchestral music which helps set the tone perfectly.\n\nYou play as Ori, a white guardian spirit (whos design much reminds me of the Pokemon Celebi and Mew) who was adopted and raised by a bear-like creature named Naru. A cataclysmic type of event happens, which forces Ori to go and explore the forest on his own. Ori meets Sein shortly after, another type of spirit who decides to help and guide Ori on it's journey to save the dying forest. The intro sequence is quite the tear-jerker and doesn't have much going on mechanically, which might lead you to believe this will be a very relaxing and slow-paced type of game. You might be disappointed if that is what you were expecting.\n\nMechanically, this is very much your tried and true metroidvania style of game, but for good reason - as the formula has aged gracefully well. You'll level up your character with health, energy and skill orbs. You'll get the staple abilities like double jump, bash and other abilities which will let you access previously out of reach parts of the games beautiful non-linear map. This is all part of the metroidvania formula, the difference is though, Moon Studios are talented and have polished the game to a sheen, while putting their own spin on the formula. The controls are incredibly tight and precise, taking some queues from games like Super Meat Boy (which some of the games sections reminds me of), Castlevania and Metroid (obviously).\n\nOne feature I absolutely love is the save system. If you have enough energy, you can drop a soul-link at any time which basically works similar to the save-state systems that you will find in popular emulators. You can also strategically use the soul-links after putting some points in the ability tree, like for example - being able to heal yourself in-between difficult platforming sections. The mechanic is quite elegantly implemented and I hope more developers borrow this feature.\n\nBecause of the neat save-system, this let the developers tune the difficulty to more to add some challenge, and Ori and the Blind Forest is quite the challenging game. Ori is fragile to start off with, even once you level up Ori a few times, there will still be creatues and platforming sections that will kill Ori in 1-2 hits. Since the controls are nigh-on perfect, I rarely felt every death wasn't something I could avoid just by playing or using my soul-links better.\n\nMoon Studios have delivered something special here. Ori and the Blind Forest is absolutely gorgeous, and plays even better. It seems Moon Studios wear their influences proudly on their sleeves, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that at all - as those are fine influences to have. A must own - I cannot wait to play the rest of it.","March 13, 2015","true","11.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

How wrong I was ! This is the best Metroidvania game I ever played. Brilliant story (the kind that could make you get a tear in the first minutes), fantastic gameplay (Super Meat Boy meets Dust : An Elysian Tail) and an amazing music score by Gareth Coker.\n\nIf you liked Valdys Story, Dust : An Elysian Tail, Super Meat Boy, Trine, Super Metroid, and you like colorful animation movies such as Disney's The Lion King, Aladdin or Miyazaki's Tonari no Totoro, Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, etc... you will definitely love this game.\n\nBest hand drawn animation I've ever seen in a 2D game, full of striking colors and variety, brilliant lightning and great tight unforgiving platforming controls makes this game the perfect love letter to any anime and Metroid fan. The art assets are actually so numerous and so well done that you cannot find them twice, according to one of the developer from the small team that compose Moon Studios.\n\nIf you're not sure about it yet, just watch a high definition trailer, it is even better looking at 60 fps when you realise that every single background part is actually animated. Four years of development in a small team that almost never met themselves in person before E3 2014 is pretty impressive for such a marvellous and astonishing piece of art.\n\n10/10\nJust a bit more than halfway into the game, I don't see what could make it lose points.\nOnly one negative part so far, you cannot get the soundtrack on Steam. Yet.\n\nGo buy it !\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWaaaa les mecs, quel jeu !\n\nJe soupçonnais qu'il y aie un truc pourrave genre mauvais effet Kisskool en regardant ces incroyables captures d'écran et vidéos, peut-être dans l'écriture, la maniabilité ou la partie audio. Comme je me trompais ! C'est sans doute le meilleur jeu Metroidvania style auquel j'ai jamais joué. Histoire touchante (le genre qui vous donnerait une larme au coin de l'oeil dans les premières minutes), un gameplay fantastique (Super Meat Boy rencontre Dust: An Elysian Tail) et une musique incroyable composée par Gareth Coker.\n\nSi vous avez aimé Valdys Story, Dust: An Elysian Tail, Super Meat Boy, Trine, Super Metroid, et si vous aimez les films d'animation riches en couleur tels que Le Roi Lion, Aladdin de Disney ou Mon Voisin Totoro, Le Voyage de Chihiro, etc de Miyazaki, vous allez certainement adorer ce jeu.\n\nLa meilleure animation dessinée à la main que je ai jamais vu dans un jeu en 2D, plein de couleurs vives et de variété, des effets de lumière impeccables et des contrôles plate-forme impitoyables mais réactifs et justes font de ce jeu la lettre d'amour parfaite à tout fan d'anime et de Metroid. Les assets d'art sont même si nombreux et si riches que vous ne pouvez pas les trouver à deux reprises, selon l'un des développeurs de la petite équipe qui compose Moon Studios.\n\nSi vous n'êtes pas encore convaincus et en train d'y jouer, regardez simplement un trailer haute définition, il est encore plus beau à 60 fps surtout quand vous réaliserez que chaque partie du background est animée. Quatre années de développement dans une petite équipe (dont les membres ne se sont d'ailleurs pratiquement jamais rencontrés en personne avant l'E3 2014) c'est assez surprenant pour un tel chef-d'oeuvre d'animation jouable.\n\n10/10\nEtant un peu plus de la moitié dans le jeu, je ne vois pas ce qui pourrait lui faire perdre des points. Peut-être la difficulté éventuellement, mais ça rappelera aux fans de jeux récents complètement idiotisés (les jeux hein, pas les fans, quoique desfois...) qu'avant on faisait des vrais jeux où fallait apprendre à jouer, et que Ori en est certainement un.\n\nSeulement un point négatif jusqu'ici, on ne peut acheter la bande son sur Steam.

I expected a cute little puzzle platformer without much depth. How wrong was I.\nThis game became a masterpiece instantly.\n\nThe game is action oriented. No puzzles. It has classic metroidvania gameplay : you unlock powers as you go (wall climbing, double jump, dash, swim, etc). You gain XP, allowing you to put points in a talent tree, upgrading your main weapon, life regen, see on the map where blocked paths and treasures are for easy backtracking, etc.\n\nControls are spot-on, very pleasing. The game is decently difficult. Enemies and hazards do a lot of damage, killing you in 3 hits usually (but there's plenty of life laying around), spikes everywhere. Combat is fairly easy. Overall you shouldn't have too much trouble progressing. The game avereages 10 hours of gameplay if you try to get all the secrets.\n\nThe story is classic and nice. You'll shed a tear at the prologue. You're a little spirit of light who must restore the elements and the great spirit tree, who were disturbed by a great bird. The whole game has a very japanese vibe, with nature spirits and evil shadows. Makes me think of Princess Mononoke.\n\nThe music is fantastic. Graphics are simply the best ever seen for hand drawn 2D (Rayman comes close but Ori takes the cake). I think the characters and enemies are 3D models, wonderfully animated.\n\nSo, yeah.

The visual art work has to be one of the best if not the best I've ever seen in a platform game.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, creative and the controls are on spot; playing with a controller I genuinely felt like I was the one in motion.

There are plenty of backtracking and surprises throughout the game so it's not a game that you'd be done with after a quick run.\n\nIf you've ever wanted a game to completely draw you into its atmosphere and make you feel like you're in a fantasy, this is the game.","March 11, 2015","true","16.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Good, but far from perfect. If you want to know why, read my full review below.\n\nIn short:\n-The game looks beautiful.\n-Music gets the job done, but it's forgettable.\n-Solid controls and gameplay.\nWhat could be a masterpiece was overrun with little flaws and not-so-great design choices.\nMy final score for Ori and the Blind Forest is a 7/10\n\nIt seems to me that this game is one of those rare occasions when artists were in charge of the final product. The art, while absolutely amazing, often gets in the way of gameplay. But we'll get to that later. First let's talk about game's visuals.\n\n-As I've said already, the art is beautiful. BUT! It is too much beautiful. It is so much beautiful that it becomes just... ordinary. The first chapters of the game are well done and have great contrast between grim surroundings and astonishing points of interests. Yet later on, literally everything on the screen yells 'look how beautiful it is!' It becomes visually overloaded to the point where I started to ignore the ammount of work that was put into the game's art. And that is a bad design choice! You can't have everyting glowy and shiny, you need something to rest your eyes on! You need contrast between plain and beautiful.\n\n-Now, what was that about art getting in the way of gameplay? More often than not there is too much clutter on the screen that makes it hard to see enemies and projectiles. And that leads to taking damage because I was unable to see the danger in time. The foreground is blocking the screen and enemies. Hitboxes for animated spiked bushes and other hazards are sometimes hard to read. And there are places where everything is the same colour - environment, enemies, projectiles, hazards. Needless to say you'll get hit there. Alot.\n\n-Music in this game is nice, but forgettable. It lacks originality to be remembered - and that is the key difference between music that just fits the theme and GOOD music.\n\n-Controls are good for the most part. And here's "but" again. At some point when new LOCAL mechanics are introduced the controls... well, could be better. It makes navigating hazardous paths extremely confusing (you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there).\n\n-Speaking of mechanics... Atleast one of the given skills is absolutely useless and only used for one forced local mechanic. I'm talking about wall climb. Ori doesn't need it! He can climb walls without any difficulties with wall jump that he gets literally in the begining of the game. Besides, going up walls with wall jump is faster than using wall climb.\n\n-Writing is good... bu-u-ut! Sometimes it doesn't makes sense.\nFor example, there's a point where Sein talks to Ori about dead gumos and he says something like "I hope Gumo can forgive us because we live and they don't." Ok... so, Ori is the last of his kind. Gumo is also the last of his kind... So why would he be angry with Ori, then? It just... doesn't make sense! Oh, and then Gumo "decides to act" and grabs the glowy thing that was holding the place together and everything starts falling apart. Why did he do that? I guess the only reason is that Developers needed a reason to make another run-for-your-life section of the game. Maybe it all has an explanation later on, but at that point I got tired of the game and didn't finish it.","March 25, 2015","true","7.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You should buy it and support the developers.\n\nThat being said, there are a few points that could've been polished:\n- Due to save mechanics, you can be stuck in death loops. You shouldn't really run into this problem if you play the game without the 100% mentality, but specially if you are willing to take damage to get a little deeper and save, you might be rewarded not with a cool secret area, but with an unplayable save file.\n- Progress can lock specific areas, and will make backtracking impossible on these.\n- You can't load a completed game to search for the stuff you didn't find.\n\nThese are decisions the developers made probably to make the game more atmospheric, and there are fixes for that aspects if you are willing to run third party scripts.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ankamius/recommended/261570/","Ankamius","Lamb (kill my wolf plz)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ankamius/","232 products in account","There is a major spoiler alert for this review since I will be going into a lot of detail, so if you're just looking for the abridged version, then it is this:\n\nGet this game. Immediately. The chances of another game trumping this for 2015 are low. $20 is not a bad deal for this game, so you're doing yourself a favor by picking it up.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, it's time to go into why this game is my current pick for game of the year for 2015.\n\nFirst of all, the gameplay is solid. I used an Xbox360 controller to play, and the only issues I could find were very minor things such as sticking to walls when I didn't want to and rarely having a slight analog push register as a full push. Beyond this, the controls are crisp and intuitive, which is absolutely critical to a platformer where most of the abilities you unlock are based on increasing your ability to move around the maps.\n\nIt helps that the game is very well tutorialized. Every time you gain a new ability, you're given an opportunity to use that ability in every way that the game could possibly expect you to do within minutes of picking it up. Even if you forget how to use the ability fast enough or are returning from a hiatus from the game, the status menu will allow you to see the abridged version of how to use the ability at any time.\n\nEven outside of abilities, there's no place in the game where you simply are expected to know something that's not intuitive. A lot of things in this game that damaage you have either a spike type of texture or a glow, and you're given a lot of time and room early on to make that connection. The game doesn't hold your hand by telling you the rules, but there is enough wiggle room that it's easy to figure out the rules of the game.\n\nAbility points are the way you upgrade in this game, which is further split up into three trees. The Combat tree increases your ability to deal damage with Sein, who is essentially an outside damage dealer that hones in on enemies nearby. Some of your other abilities also deal damage or interact with enemies in some other way, both of which fall under this tree. The Efficiency tree is all about convenience in finding all the hidden upgrades strewn throughout the world; maxing this tree will show every single secret in the game on the map (provided you have explored near the area) and allow you to see through hidden walls. The Utility tree is all about convenience in general; you use less energy, gain health when you save, and take less damage among other things when you max out this tree. Note that maxing every single tree is absolutely overkill, but it's a fun challenge and will make things much easier in the long run. It's very difficult to miss when you gain a skill point since Sein will send out a shockwave across your entire screen that will do a lot of damage to all nearly enemies.\n\nNow it's time to talk about the defining feature of this title and a largely significant reason that this game is generating buzz: the atmosphere.\n\nThe game is gorgeous. The graphics, while not fantastic, fit the gameplay itself like a glove. Parts of the scenery are dark and foreboding, yet will become lighter and greener after reviving the Ginso Tree and cleansing the water. Everything you can interact with is distinctive, at least the mandatory things. Some of the secrets are trickier to figure out, but that's not a negative as there are other clues to lead you in the right direction. Plus, secrets are placed the way they are for a reason; it wouldn't be much of a secret if you could find it without any trouble.\n\nThe animations are what truly set the graphics apart. Ori's animations especially are top notch. Despite to having a healthy size of abilities that all require their own animations, it's impressive how smoothly they blend into each other. It's a blast to just run around comboing your abilities together to get around just to watch Ori move, which is only a good example at how good the animation quality is. The background will also move when the situation demands it; the best example is if you level up in a grassy area. When the shockwave hits, virtually everything on the screen moves along with it the way it would in real life. It's mindblowing how much effort went into this type of minor detailing, but it truly adds an extra layer of depth and immersion to the game.\n\nThe soundtrack. There's no doubting it; this soundtrack is fantastic. A lot of the tracks don't sound as impressive by themselves as they do in game, but they complement the mood they're in so well that it's difficult not to be swept away in what is currently going on in the game. One clever thing I really like about the soundtrack is how much of the ambeance is in the sound effects of the situation; listen to the Forlorn Ruins escape sequence and then listen to the song by itself. The song doesn't sound anywhere near as epic by itself. One other small touch I like about this game is that the songs will loop sections of it during a cutscene where you have to move to a destination to continue, but will immediately transition to a new section of the song once you do in order to sync with the actual 'cutscene' section.\n\nDon't even get me started on the syncing. I don't even want to know how much effort and care it took to make the music and video match up as perfectly as it does, especially since a lot of cutscenes in the game have a single song for the entirety of it.\n\nSo the graphics, animation, and sound all combine together to create a fantastic atmosphere of the game, but all that does is showcase the single best part of this game and the true reason I would consider this game a fantastic example of how video games can be art:\n\nThe story.\n\nNote: This is where the majority of the spoilers will be from, so be very careful if you don't want the story to be spoiled.\n\nThis game takes several concepts that are incredibly difficult to pull off and succeeds with flying colors with all of them. The prologue introduces two characters and kills one of them off within minutes, and yet they manage to craft it in such a way that it makes the player emotionally invested enough to be sad at their loss. I know enough about story-telling to be very aware that this type of plot point so early in a story is extraordinarily difficult to do well, and when it doesn't go well... it completely fails.\n\nThe reason it works is because of how much care went into crafting the prologue. You control Naru as she finds Ori in a storm. You control Ori's walk to see Naru to create a bridge towards a feast of fruit. You control Ori's walk to investigate the ominous light. Finally, you control Ori's trek back to deliver the final batch of fruit in the nearby area to try to save Naru's life.\n\nThe ingenius thing about all of this is when the game gives you control over the characters. The first two instances are directly and blatantly happy things. The second one is ominous, but it feels like the resullt is nothing you could have any control over. The fourth is a bit different, but it drives home the overall theme of this story:\n\nHope vs. Despair.\n\nOri sees a total of four flashbacks of memories with Naru that you have just seen before the forest began to die. Ori is worried about Naru's life... but there is still hope within the fruit in Ori's arms. It's only after Ori returns and happily presents them that it becomes clear, first through confusion, then panic, then realization, that Naru had died and Ori gives in to despair. The rest of the prologue is Ori stumbling through the forest, dejected and weak, until the last breath is drawn and ends in Ori's own death. It's clearly showing that giving in to despair will erode the will to live.\n\nContinued in comments as I ran out of room.","April 15, 2015","true","252.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

Ori and the Blind Forest is, perhaps, one of the best games I havbe ever played. When it was revealed during Microsoft's E3 press conference I was immediately intrigued. The art style looked beautiful, the trailer music was perfect... I kept tabs on the game from them until the release. And finally when they announced the hard release date, I couldn't wait. I purchased the game on day 1, full price. And I was not disappointed one bit.\n\nThe story gripped me, the opening scenes grabbing my heart and then tearing it out.\n\nThe controls were perfectly fluid, jumping from platform to platform was fun- the varied animations for Ori were cool to see as he bounced through the forest. I love using the different abilities. and figuring out how to use them to reach various areas... I think I may have managed to sometimes use certain abilities to reach areas that may have been much easier accessed if I had unlocked more advanced abilities...\n\nTHE SOUNDTRACK IS JUST ABOUT THE BEST PART OF THIS GAME. If you haven't yet it's available on iTunes and AmazonMP3 to buy... *waves hand*You WILL buy this soundtrack!\n\nHowever, despite being a near perfect game, well, I hate to say it, but there are a couple things that change this from a completely perfect to a near perfect...\n-Several times in the story you trigger events which have you attempting to escape certain doom. While these chase sequences are for the most part fun, they do get difficult, and while fun, repeated deaths do make getting through them a chore since there are no checkpoints within them, forcing you to replay the chase again and again.\n-(this is kind of a minor one) I wish there was a New Game+ or at least be able to wander the forest again- there are a couple areas that I had meant to explore, only to find out that once you leave the region you can't return. This prevents the completionist from searching for the 100%, and if you use the map stones they sit there on your map just teasing you...\n\nOther than those two gripes, this game was worth every cent of its $20 price tag. It is a masterpiece; too bad this is Moon Studio's first game- too bad for them, since they already made a near perfect game... how can they top that? for their next project?","March 30, 2015","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I saw a bunch of people were streaming it on twitch, it had a beautiful art style and seemed like something I should check out. I'm glad I did.\n\nYou control Ori, "an orphan once more", who adventures to bring back the light that is now gone from the forest. While platforming and fighting through various landscapes you learn new abilities and skills through the main story elements and other collectibles on the map. The basic gameplay flows great and improves more and more as you unlock more advanced moves and are able to traverse the terrain in a variety of ways whether it's your basic doublejumps or more advanced dashes through the air.\n\nThe big thing about the game is it's beauty in every single aspect of the game. The obvious one is the stunning artstyle and animation of background and foreground elements melding in to a cohesive landscape of beauty. The beauty however goes much further than that. It's an emotional and touching story presented largely through the music, sounds and art, and it excels at each of them.\n\nFrom the moment you first open the main menu, to the moment the closing credits end, it's a damn beautiful game definitely worth experiencing. One of my favorite (if not the) platformers ever and an early leader for GOTY 2015.

At times it was just perfect composed together with a truly living story, which brought me to tears once in a while.\n\nJoy:[/b]\nThe gameplay overall is just brilliant, easy controls, smooth movement, a learning curve that introduces you to a skill at a time, making it easy to master. The levels are indeed very intriguing and pull you in the universe.\n\nRage:[/b]\nParts of the story even I found myself being angry at some of the characters, due to some of their actions. Besides that I found some levels / areas to be quite a f***ing pain in the A**. Sometimes taking me over 15 tries / deatchs at some specific parts, while bashing my keyboard the hardest i could. Having to leave the PC for an hour to cool down again. However it was only a few parts, and hey, I might be the sucky user ;)\n\nPure Amazement:[/b]\nIn total this game is totally worth it. I've never felt more happy after completing a game than this, and wanting to actually play it again, just faster and better. I have to admit it's one of the best games i've played within the last 2 years of my playtime!\n\nVerdict?

The platformer/Metroidvania genre is probably my favorite, and Ori is honestly one of the best there is if you are looking for a superb platforming experience.\n\nThe visuals are outstanding, but more than that are the controls. Anyone who is a fan of platformers knows that controls can make or break the game, and Ori has some of the tightest and most satisfying controls of any game in the genre. Never once did I feel like a death was unfair or unavoidable due to poor controls, and that is the hallmark of a classic platformer.\n\nThe story, however, is in my opinoin fairly generic, and given the amazing visuals I was hoping for a deeper story, but the gameplay is so outstanding that I can easily overlook that. I'm now on my second playthrough, which I am planning to go for 100% completion on, after which I will try for all the achievements. The game is just THAT GOOD.\n\nStory: 7/10\nGraphics: 10/10\nSound/Music: 10/10\nControls: 10/10\n-----------------\nOverall: 9/10","April 2, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything is so detailed, not just the background, but also the foreground, that you maybe miss something if you don´t watch careful enough. Along with the graphics, the colours are also very pretty. Sometimes they´re bright, sometimes they´re dark, but you´ll never have the feeling that tey are too bright or too dark so they are always just alright.\nBesides that, the animations are great, too, because they are just so fluently, which brings us to the next part: the gameplay. There is not much to say about, it is just perfect. The control is easy, at least with an gamepad, I´ve got to admit, I don´t have played it with the keyboard.\nAnother thing that I think is remarkable is the soundtrack. No matter what happens, the music always fits the situation and makes you either feel sad or happy, it depends on what has happened.\nThis leads me to the final part of this review, which is the story. I don´t want to spoiler you too much, so all I can say is, that it is very sad, but also simultaneously.\nWell, that´s it. I hope, i could have helped you and all I´ve got to say is, that I couldn´t find any mistakes in this great game.\nI wish you a good day :)","March 22, 2015","true","33.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is also worth noting that the game has a very innovative (for a jump & run) save feature which practically allows you to instantly save your location/progress at all times - short of time trials within the storyline.\n\nThe "Metroidvania" aspects of the game give you typical progression where the further you go within the main story line the more abilities you unlock which in turn allow you to backtrack and obtain previously unobtainable upgrades. This does not feel tedious at all but is actually fun - a fact which I believe also comes from the way how you can seamlessly explore the world without loading times.\nThis adds even more to the impressive (level) art style when you dash at breakneck speeds using, all your skills, while the scenery changes from an underground spider cave to lush overland greens, rocky passes, etc.\n\nVia the in-game save file my very casual play time (did not try to collect everything) was recorded as circa 10 hours, which you might say is not too much.\nHowever, considering the price tag AND how I was practically immersed, motivated and glued to the screen over the course of this play time I can high recommend "Ori and the Blind Forest."","April 2, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That was my first thought upon opening the game for the first time, and constantly reminded of while playing through the game. The visuals and scope of the game are what stand out the most, and they pull you into the game. They enhance the experience instead of pulling away from it.\n\nAnd an experience this game certainly is. The gameplay is what you would expect from a platformer, but the controls are so polished and well tuned that you are never fighting against the game to complete levels. It's all on you and your reaction time.

EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.\nThat just goes to show how dedicated this team was to bringing you their vision of this world speaking of which, even the most rotton parts of the game look great I question how I didn't lose myself to just staring at some of the more beautiful scenery.\n\nAnd now for the meat of it all, the gameplay.\nThe controls, simple and flawless I had absolutely no problem with response time and once you unlock some of the abilities I swear you'll enjoy tinkering around with what combos you can do to not only defeat your foes quickly but to use them as a way to travel further and faster than you could to begin with.\nAnd another I thing I love is the save mechanic, there are save points set in stone but you can make your own so long as you have the energy to do so (which you will have most of the time unless you've been mucking around too much).\nThese save points are also where you can open up a menu to unlock passive skills for example gaining more health when you lay down a save point.\nAlso while the game can be difficult at times it never feels like you were cheated out of the life you lost, and you almost always learn how t oavoid it the next time.\n\nAnd lastly, the story.\nIt is another simple but flawless execution of the game, I won't spoil too much but you play as something you wouldn't expect to be a hero at first glance.\nYou play as Ori, a little oh so damn adorable creature (even his taking in that first breath after coming back up from underwater is ridiculously cute) that at first can't do much but his quest is to save the "blind forest" from a great evil using whatever he can.\n\nHow would I rate this game?\n10/10\nI truly hope this game is left as is and is not milked as I sincerely believe this game is the closest thing we will ever get to perfect for a very long time.","March 14, 2015","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fantastic sound design, explosive and beautiful soundtrack, graphics that make your eyes melt and the story starts of really sad but turns into one hell of an adventure!\n\nAnd of course, as everyone else has stated; this game is VERY DIFFICULT. Even for me who has played platformers since the early 90's. Not even the latest Rayman games, who I think is pretty hard, is anything compared to the stunts you will perform in this game. It's more or less a trial and error game, so your first play through means ALOT of deaths.\n\nSome of the sequences is so fantastic with every great element of the game just exploding in your face. It's hard to even grasp the awesomeness at those points.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest is a must have game and one of the best platformers ever, if not the best. It's a breath of fresh air in these AAA times and games like this is rare gems. The difficulty might make some people crazy, but if you persistent you'll might just pull the whole game off, with great satisfaction. You don't want to miss Ori and the Blind Forest!\n\n11/10","March 17, 2015","true","38.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, prepare to die quite a bit.\n\nAt times, it is the rare unexpected gems that stand out among the masses. As a person that doesn't play many platformers, I initially didn't pay Ori and the Blind Forest much mind. However, as word got around I decided to give it a spin, and what a pleasant surprise it has been!\n\nThough it has been said by literally everyone now, the art style in this game is absolutely beautiful. From the way background objects sway when Ori walks past to the animation quality, this game oozes visual polish. Combined with an outstanding soundtrack, the game immediately draws you into its well-crafted world.\n\nFrom the get go, the game starts off with incredible amount of emotion; I can say that I have never been so invested in a purple and black blob before, and that's literally within the first few minutes of the game! For such a simple story, it was impactful and very well presented despite having no voice acting and little narration.\n\nI am not an experienced platform player, and at times, I was frustrated by the 'escape' sections that involved a lot of death and repeats. However, after finishing the game I feel that the gameplay while challenging, isn't unfair. While at certain sections it may be difficult to tell where you should go or what to avoid, the hazards in the game are generally well telegraphed and avoidable. It is worth noting, however, that a controller is HIGHLY recommended, as the keyboard controls are known to be clunkier.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game for those interested in a beautifully crafted platformer with a reasonable degree of challenge. For the price tag, this is a fantastic game that completely took me by surprise and will remain in memory for a long time to come. Bring a controller for a better experience.","March 17, 2015","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is fun and challenging. Wonderful game. One of my few gripes is that the cutscenes would lag and framedrop, and the sounds would be off track with the visuals, which was annoying. By far my biggest problem with this game is that once you complete the story, there is no possible way to revisit that particular save slot, unless you start all over. In my case, I planned on unlocking more abilities after the main story, however, I am unable to do that, which extremely sucks and defeats any sort of replayability besides starting the entire game over again. One thing I noticed is that the game would paused randomly during cutscenes for no reason (not sure if this is just me). My computer should be able to handle this game, but just keep in mind, with all that is going on onscreen (this game is very artistic), you may have to play in a lower res for everything to run smoothly. Overall though, I really enjoy Ori. The controls are spot on, and it is a blast to platform and run through levels. When you die you quickly respawn where you last saved, sort of like supermeatboy; which is great considering there are some points in the game that you will attempt over 50 times (damn those spikes!). Again, If there was one thing I would change, it would be the ability to revisit a game where the story is completed. Other than that, definitely worth the money!","March 17, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sorry did I say good? I meant to say it's amazing. It's a gorgeous 2D platform adventure with some non-intrusive combat and light puzzles. It's very polished with slick presentation and plenty of charm. The only minor frustrations are the lack of auto-checkpoints - you have to save manually using an orb system - and some imprecise jumping mechanics when dealing with thin platforms (in all likely that is just a lack of skill on my part though),\n\nCheck it out...you might be as pleasantly surprised as I was.","March 12, 2015","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/akirahansjuris/recommended/261570/","akirahansjuris","AkiraHansJuris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/akirahansjuris/","224 products in account",""Ori and the Blind Forest" is unquestionably one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nThe mechanics are solid, well thought out, and damn fun to work with. By the time I had completed the game, I had died 492 times. This game is hard... brutally hard... but when you fail, it's your own fault. No cheap shots, no blind jumps, nothing. You can also save at ANY time, creating a respawn point wherever you are standing to further alleviate the frustation of a particularly difficult section. One of the more interesting aspects is your reliance on enemies. Ori isn't particularly strong, but he is exceedingly agile and clever. Often I found that the most effective strategies relied on tricking enemies into hitting one another, or redirecting bullets to destroy obstacles. Combat becomes a fast-paced puzzle, rather than a boring run through the level. The platforming is fair, and I never had any difficulty distinguishing what I could and couldn't stand on. An ever-expanding arsenal of abilities (wall jump, air dash, double jump, etc.) help keep movement fresh, and make retracing your steps after completing a dungeon an enjoyable ego boost!\n\nThe game does a wonderful job conveying emotion and character through the player's interaction with the world. At points, the character is slowed down, or animated differently to help drive home the story, which is well integrated with the platforming. You really get attached to Ori, and at points I genuinely felt bad for allowing him to die. Chase sequences are well designed, and are just as heart-pounding as they should be without forcing in a contrived cutscene. They serve equally as a challenge to test your newly acquired skills, and a cinematic moment to carry the story, but be warned, they are by far the most difficult portions of the game.\n\nThe artwork in "Ori" is absolutely without peer. The environment, the characters, just the look of the thing is phenomonal. They convey a sense of grandure and scale, without seeming out of place. Subtle visuals also help make the game easier to understand. Portals joining different parts of the levels will glow when Ori gets near them, showing you which pair is linked. A faint blue trail of energy is visible before performing a wall-dash, helping you know where you'll end up. You simply can not argue that this game isn't beautiful, in both aesthetic, and design.\n\nThe story is heartfelt and sincere, and I was shocked to find myself in tears only 10 minutes in. While it isn't anything truely innovative in terms of narrative, it's extremely well composed and the delivery is flawless. The entire experience lasted me a solid 10 hours, and I was completely engrossed the entire time, serving as a perfect compliment to the rest of the game.\n\nI'm not recommending you play this game, I'm demanding it. If you only have $20 to spend on Steam this year, seriously consider picking up this game.","March 16, 2015","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I see myself playing through it again just to get all the achievements. That being said, there is one thing you need to know. While the game starts in happy-go-lucky way, it has 6 chase sequences that are brutally hard. Whenever you finish a temple section, one thing or the other is going to chase you away from there. Those sequences require you to know exactly what obstacle lies ahead. You'll have to memorize and practice each move. It is very old school and caters to gamers that enjoy speedruns of classic games. But there are only 6 or so sequences and believe me, if I can master them so can you :) At first it was easy to feel a little frustrated, but once you understand what is expected of you it is doable to punch through them and there is a significant sense of relief and achievement that makes it all worthwhile.\n\nBest platformer I have played.....for a veeeeery long time.","March 12, 2015","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not easy, but platformer shouldn't be something you make on the first try without a problem. and I am happy that this was released on PC as one of it's main platforms. It's definitely worth the money imo.\n\nThings that should be fixed.\nThere are several weird collision polygons, or whatever is used.\nThe save system should store 1-2 previous save locations in case you get stucked somewhere.

The viuals and sound are superb overall its well worth a purchase if you enjoy platformers in any capacity.\n\nThere are a few negatives however the most crippling being the spikes in difficulty most are not so bad due to the save (almost) anywhere feature but the escape sequences in particualar ruin the flow of the game and quickly become tedious exercises in trial and error gameplay that sour the entire experience.\n\nI also encountered a few glitches such as falling through the floor or in one case passing through the ceiling and in the final dungeon my controls stopped working properly for the bash move (thankfully only the D pad was sporadiucally effected with it meaning I could use the analog stick to complete the game). But these were few and mostly far between except the control issue in the final dungeon and were not enough to ruin my enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe story is simple but nice in its execution I feel however that it would have been more powerful as a short animated feature or a childrens book.\n\nIf you hate platformers or get easily frustrated with them I would stay away from this game. Its not insanely difficult but I feel it will  step over the line of challenging to annoying once to many times for a lot of people, the first and last escape sequences were a particular low point.\n\nDespite my above criticism the game is definietely worth a look despite its flaws and it kept me hooked up until th end even if by the end the lack of fast travel killed any want for further exploration from me and I just wanted the game to be over.\n\nIf you can get past the difficulty spikes and put up with occasional wonky hit detection (very minor but no less anoying issue) I would say get this game.","March 16, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/larexus/recommended/261570/","larexus","Larexus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/larexus/","433 products in account","Ori and the Blind Forest is a beautiful and heartfelt adventure that comes with a surprising amount of challenge.\n\n--Summary Down below--\n\nGameplay\n\nOri's gameplay consists of alot of challenging platforming scenarios and exploration. Exploration is key to succeeding through the game, as you will find keystones needed to progress, ability points for upgrading, map stones for helping with exploration, upgrades such as life and spirit increases and the occasional secret area. Getting through alot of these areas can be very difficult and can on the occasion take some trial and error but for the most part it is a skill based game and would attribute most of my deaths to player error as the controls were very responsive and worked smoothly.\n\nAs you progress through the game you will come into contact with many other abilities that you will need to use to over come challenges along the way as well as open up other areas that were before blocked. Not one of these abilities goes to waste and the level design makes sure you need to make full use of your abilities to progress. Be careful though, if you want to collect everything in the game make sure you do that before completing the final level, because at that point it will not allow you to continue playing that save file.\n\nGraphics\nThis game is beautiful and well crafted. Travelling through the forests around the spirit tree you become lost in its beauty and this eleviates some of the pain of dying as you get to spend just a little more time in some of these areas. The action scenes were stunning, whether it be climbing for your life from water rushing up below you or running for an exit while burning magma crashes behind you destroying everything in its path you can't help but feel a scense, of wonderment.\n\nEvery new area is filled with eye candy and just when you thought it couldn't get any more beautiful, the next blows your mind again. Personally my favourite area was the Misty woods. Character designs were well done and unique and the animation and movement of Ori looked smooth. The only design that I felt was lacking in animation was the small birds that dived at you when they seen you.\n\nAudio\nThe music for this game consumed me and brought me into the world they were portraying, from its powerful orchestral song that plays while you are running for your life or the ambience setting music of the Misty woods it brings an experience that would not be the same without it. It was never trying to be spooky or danger driven but more filled with excitement and wonderment. Even after beating the game I can still here that song playing in my head drawing me to want to come and play more.\n\nStory\nNot going to give much away cause I believe everyone should experience this game. You play as Ori, the last remaing spirit of the once powerful spirit tree that has now had his light taken from it by a shadowed bird that despises the light. Your goal is to revive the light in the areas of the forest to revive the spirit tree and bring life back to the forest.\n\nSummary\nOri and the Blind Forest is a wondrous adventure that will have you drooling at the beautiful well designed world the developers have created as you try to restore light to the spirit tree and forest. Every new area feels fresh and well crafted and will want you wanting to explore every inch of it. This is a good thing as most of the gameplay revolves around exploration as this will lead to various items that will help you progress through the game or sometimes even a secret area. As you progress you will obtain new abilities that will allow you to go back and progress through previously blocked or unreachable areas, allowing you to reach more of the map. What really bring this world together though is the music design that is top notch and will have you feeling excited and sucked in.\n\nAll in all this is one adventure I would recommend to anybody and is one of the best gaming experiences I have had in a long time. The mix of beauty, exploration as well as a good amount of challenge make for a top notch gaming experience. Also in my entire first playthrough I ran into no bugs or crashes, other than once my game froze up but I soon realized it was because my windows update was kicking in.. and it returned to normal shortly after. Maybe I'm lucky?","April 5, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I tend to be a more casual gamer, in that I play sporadically and don't tend to keep up with the latest releases.  I figure I'll get to them... eventually.  This one caught my eye and between the graphics and the music in the trailers, I thought I'd give it a try.\n\nI have not played this obsessively since I was a kid fighting my brother for the controller.\n\nEverything about this game is beautiful.  Even in the most stressful parts of the game - and I don't handle video game stress well - I still found myself humming to the music.  I don't spend much time collecting things in games, I tend to stick to the plotline, but I went exploring because the gameplay was so captivating and the scenery was so gorgeous.  I may even replay this game, which again, isn't something I've done since I was a kid.\n\nYes, it's a hard game.  I died a lot.  But I found myself enjoying the challenge and honestly, this game has made me love gaming again, to the exclusion of all the other things that have pulled me away.","April 8, 2015","true","26.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's the perfect platform adventure video game, designed by Moon Studios an independent developer and published by Microsoft Studios.\nThe story, the characters, the animations, art design, film sequences, the wonderful music... everything is catching you from the start and all those wonderful things are not letting you go without a tear in your eye (if you don't cry right from the start you have to be a robot, a zombie or sth. else ^^).\nOri is playable with keyboard or controller (I am using an official Microsoft XBox 360 -PC- Controller = works great with this game).\nYou will unlock several new abilities during Ori's adventure, there are 3 different skill trees with a lot to learn for our lil rascal (Ori is for sure the cutest video game platform character I ever played with).\n\nIam playing video- as well as computer games for a very long time now (since the first personal computer and so computer games arrived) and this is one of the great games with everything a gamer can ask for.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest is climbing the platform game Mount Olympus in 2015, where it watch over all of our gamer hearts and souls, together with Super Mario, Sonic, Super Meat Boy and the one and only Kirby.\n\nIf you are looking for an intelligent level design, various abilities, uplifiting music, great animations and heartbreaking cuteness... then go and buy Ori and the Blind Forest !\n\nTogether with Kirby's Adventure (NES 1993), Ori and the Blind Forest (PC 2015) is my favorite platformer to this day.\n\nThank you Moon Studios (developer team), thank you Microsoft Studios (publisher), thank you Thomas Mahler (director), Gareth Coker (composer) + musicians  and just everybody involved in the making of this wonderful game (a bright shining pearl).\n\nOri just makes my gamer heart smile. A beautiful world- and character design, lovely music, great controls. Aesthetically, Ori is (by far) the best platformer until this day!\n\nMini Kong (needs another tissue ^^) thinks Ori and the Blind Forest deserves a 9.7 out of 10.","April 9, 2015","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ori and the Blind Forest strikes you right out of the gate with beautiful scenery and music, and then continues to pound away at you at every point in the story. The game encourages saving a lot and saving often, as everything in this forest will want to kill you. The dungeons especially will test your mastery of the skills you've picked up leading toward them.\n\nSimilar to old Metroid games, the forest is one massive map that will tempt you to backtrack every time you gain a new ability to see what secrets can now be revealed.\n\nOri is not without its bugs, but it's easy to look past that at a wonderful and challenging platformer.

I neither find myself left with the desire to write one, nor am I any good at doing so. I intend to lengthen this review once i've completed the game, but what i've experienced so far is something I haven't seen in a video game in a very long time. The prologue for this game was enough to make me see the beauty I believe this game has to offer. The amazing Artwork in combination to it's beautiful music and storytelling is reigniting a certain spark I havent felt from other games in some time. I know my review doesn't tell you much about the gameplay, but I believe this is one game no one should pass up. I'm certainly glad I didn't.","March 10, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every single visual aspect is so amazingly crafted and represented, it's quite surprisingly how much effort was put into it.\n\n-The platforming/controls\nI didn't expect this would have such a heavy focus on platforming and precision. Many times the game requires you to pull off a lot precise jumps, with tight timing. It's very rarely frustrating. In a lot of ways it reminded me of Super Meat Boy in that regard.\n\nWhat I liked,\n\n-Metroidvania\nIt's not the most complex of it's kind, but I enjoyed the fact that a lot of the early upgrades are not accessible by your current abilities. I didn't feel like the game was holding my hand too much and there were plenty of reasonably hidden upgrades. I'm a sucker for this kind of game so it's easy to please. I would have liked if the game went a little more down this path\n\n-Closed off platforming 'dungeons'\nA few times in the game it sends you to a standalone area that is essentially a dungeon with specific platforming mechanics. These are where the level design tend to shine. During these sections the game is not limited to being interconnected as much and can simply be a platformer. These are usually where the game introduces the most difficult platfomring requirements.\n\nWhat I didn't like as much,\n\n-The platforming 'dungeons' are literally closed off permanently\nWhen you complete these sections of the game, you can't go back. If you miss any collectibles or upgrades, they are gone forever. That's lame. In a Metroidvania, the one thing you should never do is restrict my access to the gameworld. Especially if it's going to prevent me from getting 100%\n\n-Lengthy chase sequences that require perfection with no checkpoints\nMaybe I should just "get good"? Later in the game there are some segments where you are being chased and are on a timer and have to complete sequences of platforming near perfectly. If you mess up you are instantly reverted back to the beginning. I admit they can be prett exhilerating but it's very easy to mess up and have to redo it over and over and over. And then it becomes frustrating. The final one of these were the worst offender in my opinion.\n\n\n\nSo looking it over, Ori and the Blind Forest has some faults but overall it's still a really awesome game. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants something super pretty but also is looking for something with a chellenge.","March 20, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Once I saw the trailers I immediately bought the game right then and there and started playing.\n\nAll I can say is that I LOVE this game. It's beauitful, I can't repeat enough how gorgeous it's art and gameplay is. The music is very vibrant and gets that sense of adventure and a great sound to the ears while playing so you're never bored. The colors and scenery is vibrant. Character design is amazing, and the story line of the game is very touching and actually made me tear a little bit. I would have to say that Ori is a very artful game. Maybe not to some who doesn't appreciate it; but to me this game was beautiful and amazing.\n\nThere's so many secrets within the game and a few small goals to go towards while playing it. I took my time playing this game and not to rush through it because of how fun it is.\n\nMy overall summary:\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nStory: 10/10\nMusic: 10/10\nArt/Design: 10/10","March 17, 2015","true","23.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is also worth noting that the game has a very innovative (for a jump & run) save feature which practically allows you to instantly save your location/progress at all times - short of time trials within the storyline.\n\nThe "Metroidvania" aspects of the game give you typical progression where the further you go within the main story line the more abilities you unlock which in turn allow you to backtrack and obtain previously unobtainable upgrades. This does not feel tedious at all but is actually fun - a fact which I believe also comes from the way how you can seamlessly explore the world without loading times.\nThis adds even more to the impressive (level) art style when you dash at breakneck speeds using, all your skills, while the scenery changes from an underground spider cave to lush overland greens, rocky passes, etc.\n\nVia the in-game save file my very casual play time (did not try to collect everything) was recorded as circa 10 hours, which you might say is not too much.\nHowever, considering the price tag AND how I was practically immersed, motivated and glued to the screen over the course of this play time I can high recommend "Ori and the Blind Forest."","April 2, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/akirahansjuris/recommended/261570/","akirahansjuris","AkiraHansJuris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/akirahansjuris/","224 products in account",""Ori and the Blind Forest" is unquestionably one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nThe mechanics are solid, well thought out, and damn fun to work with. By the time I had completed the game, I had died 492 times. This game is hard... brutally hard... but when you fail, it's your own fault. No cheap shots, no blind jumps, nothing. You can also save at ANY time, creating a respawn point wherever you are standing to further alleviate the frustation of a particularly difficult section. One of the more interesting aspects is your reliance on enemies. Ori isn't particularly strong, but he is exceedingly agile and clever. Often I found that the most effective strategies relied on tricking enemies into hitting one another, or redirecting bullets to destroy obstacles. Combat becomes a fast-paced puzzle, rather than a boring run through the level. The platforming is fair, and I never had any difficulty distinguishing what I could and couldn't stand on. An ever-expanding arsenal of abilities (wall jump, air dash, double jump, etc.) help keep movement fresh, and make retracing your steps after completing a dungeon an enjoyable ego boost!\n\nThe game does a wonderful job conveying emotion and character through the player's interaction with the world. At points, the character is slowed down, or animated differently to help drive home the story, which is well integrated with the platforming. You really get attached to Ori, and at points I genuinely felt bad for allowing him to die. Chase sequences are well designed, and are just as heart-pounding as they should be without forcing in a contrived cutscene. They serve equally as a challenge to test your newly acquired skills, and a cinematic moment to carry the story, but be warned, they are by far the most difficult portions of the game.\n\nThe artwork in "Ori" is absolutely without peer. The environment, the characters, just the look of the thing is phenomonal. They convey a sense of grandure and scale, without seeming out of place. Subtle visuals also help make the game easier to understand. Portals joining different parts of the levels will glow when Ori gets near them, showing you which pair is linked. A faint blue trail of energy is visible before performing a wall-dash, helping you know where you'll end up. You simply can not argue that this game isn't beautiful, in both aesthetic, and design.\n\nThe story is heartfelt and sincere, and I was shocked to find myself in tears only 10 minutes in. While it isn't anything truely innovative in terms of narrative, it's extremely well composed and the delivery is flawless. The entire experience lasted me a solid 10 hours, and I was completely engrossed the entire time, serving as a perfect compliment to the rest of the game.\n\nI'm not recommending you play this game, I'm demanding it. If you only have $20 to spend on Steam this year, seriously consider picking up this game.","March 16, 2015","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you want an unbiased review good luck have fun finding one :P. I have done my best to have no spoilers.\n\nI’m breaking my usual silence and letting my voice join the masses here and to put it simply: This game is a Masterpiece.\n\nThe sound track and artwork is what got my attention with this game, and so I promptly broke my own rule and bought it “judging a book by its cover”. I was thankfully not disappointed and believe the music and art alone is worth the money paid. The music is moving and at times emotive, setting a great atmosphere for the game. The art work and design compliments this brilliantly and is beautiful, vibrant and diverse. It just drew me in.\n\nThe story itself is simple but moving (some might say cliché) and I feel keeps the game rolling nicely. The intro especially tugged at my heart strings. I don’t usually sentimental over games (I’m not even sure if an adult getting emotional over a game is a good or bad thing) but this game succeeded for me and did its job well.\n\nAs for the gameplay… I don’t usually play platformers (metriod/castlevania games) but again I found it highly enjoyable, while challenging at the same time, and it may have converted me to the genre.  You start off with nothing to begin with, but as you progress through the game you slowly (or quickly if you’re speed running) unlock more abilities and skills to help you progress and unlock previously inaccessible secrets, keeping the game steady, entertaining and interesting.\n\nI must warn you however, that there are some pretty steep difficulty spikes in the game. There are even a couple of areas in the game which are completely insane (you will know them when you find them). They will render all (but the most veteran and skilled) gamers, banging heads against keyboards, smashing controllers and using words they didn’t know existed. However these areas and difficulty spikes are NOT impossible. With a little practice, possibly a lot of repetition and a new controller, you will get the hang of it, eventually beating these difficulty spikes and areas. When you do, it is immensely satisfying and rewarding (made me feel elated – I actually danced a jig for not dying on my 67th attempt at one point :P).\n\nIn summary, I believe this game is an absolute gem, well worth the money and would recommend it to anyone. It successfully dragged me away from my other games, which is an achievement the game should be proud of. My main advice is to take your time on the first play through, enjoy the scenery, enjoy the game and don’t give up. Oh and playing with a controller is highly recommended.\n\nI’ve never done a review before so sorry for any mistakes and if it was too long.

Best looking indy game in a long time, if not ever.The core gameplay is also solid. It draws so directly upon the old classics that you could almost forget that exploration platformers were dead for the better part of two decades.\n\nBut here's the catch. Ori's devs proudly annouce that they are a bunch of ex triple-A gamedevs, and triple-A clings to Ori like the taint that rots the forest. It's small things, but they add up. Take for instance the overly long intro sequence in which you are only allowed to walk, because drama. Then look at the escape sequences, especially the first one. These are long trial and error passages without any save spots because, again, drama. This is triple-A thinking, when the cinematic presentation of the game gets in the way of its gameplay.\n\nA few other gameplay nitpicks are the lack of a teleportation system (and the fixed save stations look to me as if they were planned to be used as such) and closing the game upon winning the game. Really? These are quality of life things for people who want to play your game! I don't care that the story says Ori can't explore the forest when done, forcing the player to either make a copy before the last dungeon or playing a second time is lazy and unnecessary.\n\nMy last major gripe is the overreliance on instagib mechanics. In the last third of the game you get positivly swamped with health containers, but without any meaning, because you still instantly die almost everywhere. This makes the game feel more like Donkey Kong Country 2 than a typical metroidvania. I did really like the limited life mechanic in combination with free saves. It works reallly well in the open world, but gets completely subverted in the dungeons, which are cheap platform hell, and rubberbanding water masses are not cool, no matter how cinematic they look.\n\nOverall it still is a good game. But not a great one as everyone seems to think because it looks wonderful.","March 19, 2015","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Glad I did.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous. All the colors are vibrant and pleasant to look at and the game has a pretty cool visual style that is reinforced by the use of mixed-mediums. The graphics are good as a whole and all the models, effects, backgrounds, enemies and so on look pretty good. Despite the myriad effects, I did not feel any strain on my computer.\n\nThe action is fairly fast-paced. There is a recommendation on Steam to use a controller and that does seem to be the better option. I am playing on my keyboard and it definitely is playable but there are a bunch of sections that feel as if a controller would have been better.\n\nI am not too far into the game yet so I can't comment much on the story or characters as a whole. It seems to be a fairly simple story but it does what it does well. The first five minutes have brought tears to my eyes, which I very rarely get from games (or films, or books or etc...). Part of me would like to know more about the world but I think that would be detrimental to a game like this. I have to mention it that Ori is ♥♥♥♥ing adorable.\n\nMany of the negative reviews I read complained about difficulty and yes, it is difficult. Unforgiving and prone to trial-and-error at places. But I wouldn't put that as a negative. However, there are some parts that *will* frustrate you. However, I have given up on other games for far less wheras I stuck with this one and this tells something about it.\n\nThe checkpoint system (which is effectively a create-your-own-checkpoint system) alleviates most of the frustration that comes from difficulty. It costs energy to create checkpoints but with the right perks, you can make them reusable and cost less. As a whole, this helps the pacing a lot.\n\nSome of the reviewers also mentioned bugs. Haven't had any bug issues so far (about midway into the game). As a whole, this feels like one of the more stable games I have played.\n\nDefinitely recommend it.\n\nEdit: Now that I completed it, my main points stands for most part. Definitely going to re-iterate my comments about keyboard VS Controller. The latter seems to work much better.\n\nStory is simple but what it does, it does well. The ending was tugging at the heartstrings just as much as anything. If one critique, we didn't see much closure between Ori and Naru, which is a shame, given how much effort the game took to build their relationship.\n\nOne serious issue I have is in regards to the instructions received in the game about new abilities. Once a new ability is received, how to use them briefly flashes on the screen and that is it. Normally that is enough but when a move has multiple methods or uses, this gets problematic. I did not discover a certain way to use one of the abilities until near the endgame upon which I could have used it to get into couple areas I could not enter, leaving powerups behind.\n\nThe second critique I have ties to the first in that there were sections of the map that were disproportionately hard to get to. Breakable walls are one thing but some sections of the maps were blocked off by unbreakable walls that had to be opened via a switch or some other special trigger. Problem is, a lot of these were very well hidden. Couple of them I discovered by accident, one by educated guess but the rest, I could not locate. Again, it kept me from a %100 completion. Now, I don't expect this game to spoonfeed people. It seems to take pride in its difficulty and that is ok. But I pride myself an attentive player and I spent a lot of time around each blockade, slamming, dashing and charging at anything I could find before giving up. Similarly, there were sections in the game where I could see a powerup through the wall but nowhere to get to, even when I investigated each portion of land surrounding it. I suppose it would be less source of frustration to have a few more indicators on how to reach such places.\n\nStill, my recommendation stands. This game is definitely worth playing.\n\nAlso, 620 deaths :p","March 17, 2015","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You should buy it and support the developers.\n\nThat being said, there are a few points that could've been polished:\n- Due to save mechanics, you can be stuck in death loops. You shouldn't really run into this problem if you play the game without the 100% mentality, but specially if you are willing to take damage to get a little deeper and save, you might be rewarded not with a cool secret area, but with an unplayable save file.\n- Progress can lock specific areas, and will make backtracking impossible on these.\n- You can't load a completed game to search for the stuff you didn't find.\n\nThese are decisions the developers made probably to make the game more atmospheric, and there are fixes for that aspects if you are willing to run third party scripts.

The dungeon escapes certainly spiked up the difficulty, especially since you tended to have only recently learned the new ability required to get out, but keeping at it after a while tends to yield success.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reabora/recommended/261570/","reabora","Liam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reabora/","76 products in account","Ori and the Blind Forest is a 2D platformer created by Moon Studios where, after an apocalypse caused by a dark force causes the death of Ori’s adoptive parent Naru, the player must navigate a series of puzzles and fight enemies using a range of different abilities unlocked throughout the game to restore balance to the world.  The game takes places in a sprawling forest that includes caves, mountains and secret tunnels.\nWhen the game begins all Ori is capable of doing to navigate the world is a basic jump allowing the player to reach some higher areas of the map, however they are still greatly hindered by the geography of the environment until more abilities are unlocked. The player is introduced the basic movement and jumping mechanics in an interactive backstory in which the player can control Ori and Naru for brief periods of time. This allows the player to become immersed in the story while naturally learning how to navigate the world. As the game progresses and new abilities are unlocked, similar tutorial sections are implemented. These will typically involve the current surroundings in the form of puzzles that let the player continue to progress while mastering these new skills.\nAs the number of skills available to the player increase, the difficulty increases quickly as player will find themselves requiring the quick successive use of different powers in order to conquer the challenges presented to them. Frustration in the player can grow greatly in sections like this where some puzzles can take many attempts in order to complete. Fortunately The Blind Forest includes a mechanic where a player can use their energy resource, which is usually spent on more powerful attacks, to create a checkpoint wherever they are so hours aren’t spent trekking back to puzzles from checkpoints like many other games. While frustratingly difficult, the immersive story of Ori and the Blind Forest is enough to force them to carry on until the end.\nWhile primarily being a puzzle/action game, Ori and the Blind Forest also includes elements of collection consisting of upgrades to the player’s health, energy and abilities. Rather than just gather these items as the player moves through their respective locations, these items are often inaccessible to the player on their first trip through, requiring the use of abilities yet to be unlocked in order to acquire them. This encourages plenty of exploration from the player as if they wish to collect everything it will almost certainly require backtracking.\nThe aesthetics and sounds of the game are also a major part its charm as the atmosphere created by these elements greatly enhances the player’s experience and makes them want to spend even more time in the world. While player actions take place in only two dimensions, there is often movement going on in the foreground, creating the sense that you are in a three dimensional world.\nThrough clever use of mechanics, story and aesthetics, Ori and the Blind Forest is able to create a world which, while difficult to traverse, can keep even the most infuriated player immersed for hours on end.","March 20, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every single visual aspect is so amazingly crafted and represented, it's quite surprisingly how much effort was put into it.\n\n-The platforming/controls\nI didn't expect this would have such a heavy focus on platforming and precision. Many times the game requires you to pull off a lot precise jumps, with tight timing. It's very rarely frustrating. In a lot of ways it reminded me of Super Meat Boy in that regard.\n\nWhat I liked,\n\n-Metroidvania\nIt's not the most complex of it's kind, but I enjoyed the fact that a lot of the early upgrades are not accessible by your current abilities. I didn't feel like the game was holding my hand too much and there were plenty of reasonably hidden upgrades. I'm a sucker for this kind of game so it's easy to please. I would have liked if the game went a little more down this path\n\n-Closed off platforming 'dungeons'\nA few times in the game it sends you to a standalone area that is essentially a dungeon with specific platforming mechanics. These are where the level design tend to shine. During these sections the game is not limited to being interconnected as much and can simply be a platformer. These are usually where the game introduces the most difficult platfomring requirements.\n\nWhat I didn't like as much,\n\n-The platforming 'dungeons' are literally closed off permanently\nWhen you complete these sections of the game, you can't go back. If you miss any collectibles or upgrades, they are gone forever. That's lame. In a Metroidvania, the one thing you should never do is restrict my access to the gameworld. Especially if it's going to prevent me from getting 100%\n\n-Lengthy chase sequences that require perfection with no checkpoints\nMaybe I should just "get good"? Later in the game there are some segments where you are being chased and are on a timer and have to complete sequences of platforming near perfectly. If you mess up you are instantly reverted back to the beginning. I admit they can be prett exhilerating but it's very easy to mess up and have to redo it over and over and over. And then it becomes frustrating. The final one of these were the worst offender in my opinion.\n\n\n\nSo looking it over, Ori and the Blind Forest has some faults but overall it's still a really awesome game. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants something super pretty but also is looking for something with a chellenge.","March 20, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The platformer/Metroidvania genre is probably my favorite, and Ori is honestly one of the best there is if you are looking for a superb platforming experience.\n\nThe visuals are outstanding, but more than that are the controls. Anyone who is a fan of platformers knows that controls can make or break the game, and Ori has some of the tightest and most satisfying controls of any game in the genre. Never once did I feel like a death was unfair or unavoidable due to poor controls, and that is the hallmark of a classic platformer.\n\nThe story, however, is in my opinoin fairly generic, and given the amazing visuals I was hoping for a deeper story, but the gameplay is so outstanding that I can easily overlook that. I'm now on my second playthrough, which I am planning to go for 100% completion on, after which I will try for all the achievements. The game is just THAT GOOD.\n\nStory: 7/10\nGraphics: 10/10\nSound/Music: 10/10\nControls: 10/10\n-----------------\nOverall: 9/10","April 2, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything is so detailed, not just the background, but also the foreground, that you maybe miss something if you don´t watch careful enough. Along with the graphics, the colours are also very pretty. Sometimes they´re bright, sometimes they´re dark, but you´ll never have the feeling that tey are too bright or too dark so they are always just alright.\nBesides that, the animations are great, too, because they are just so fluently, which brings us to the next part: the gameplay. There is not much to say about, it is just perfect. The control is easy, at least with an gamepad, I´ve got to admit, I don´t have played it with the keyboard.\nAnother thing that I think is remarkable is the soundtrack. No matter what happens, the music always fits the situation and makes you either feel sad or happy, it depends on what has happened.\nThis leads me to the final part of this review, which is the story. I don´t want to spoiler you too much, so all I can say is, that it is very sad, but also simultaneously.\nWell, that´s it. I hope, i could have helped you and all I´ve got to say is, that I couldn´t find any mistakes in this great game.\nI wish you a good day :)","March 22, 2015","true","33.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Which made me leery of buying it. I didnt want so spend 20 dollars on another game like that. However it is much more action based. It is a very elaborately animated game with a great sound track. I havent beaten it yet but everything I have seen so far I have enjoyed. It can be very challenging at times, especially for the not so great at platformers player. I had a bit of an issue getting the game to run however. I had to verify the game to get it to launch consistently. Plus I noticed that running the game in fullscreen would cause the pictire to flicker durring parts of cut scenes and while looking at the map also it would stutter slightly while playing. That stutter can make it very hard to time maneuvers. The game in all regards ran much better while in windowed mode, but I didnt want to play with those edges on my screen. After making a post though I discoved that using the launch option -popupwindow corrected the performace problem. I would say this game is a good buy for the price, even though I am concerned that it may not be as long as I would like. As I said before though, I havent beaten it yet.\n\nJust completed my first playthrough. At a play time of 8hrs 40min I'd consider that rather short. But I am not disappointed. The 20 dollars was well spent in my mind. If you aren't willing to pay that much you should deffinately watch for this one to go on sale.

I'm in the video games industry and I could only dream of working on such a title. Every single background is mind-blowing, the gameplay is very responsive and enjoyable, the storyline focuses on very deep and meaningful themes (mostly life, death, and sacrifice), and the soundtrack is breathtaking. It feels like Metroid about how the entire map is designed (you go back and forth, finally reaching bonuses thanks to the latest upgrade you unlocked), and there is definitely something of Rayman Origins/Legends in how this game is played. Your character levels up and gains new abilities throughout the entire game. Choices don't seem to matter that much at first but it's because you actually improve your skills while progressing into the game, without even noticing. I'm stating the obvious here, but a gamepad is mandatory. I had a few bugs with my Xbox One gamepad though (3 freezes during the game, probably because I pressed too many buttons, and a recurring issue while trying to load my game).\n\nThe game is not perfect but it's as close as it can get in my opinion. Yes it's a bit short (10 hours on my part and I almost reached 100% on the first run), yes some people will find the game too easy (the last part of each dungeon can be quite tricky though, casual players may have a hard time on these). The only things I didn't like in this game is it's impossible to come back in certain areas (dungeons usually lock once you've been there), and the fact that the game has no replay value. Yet, nothing game-breaking. The game is still VERY enjoyable (truth be told, I cried 3 times!). It's an amazing game and it's totally worth its full price. It's a gaming experience I'll probably never forget, and that says a lot... Buy it, enjoy it, even cry a bit in between if you want, replay it 5 years later. 10/10, hands down. I would buy a sequel on its release without any hesitation.","March 21, 2015","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The stages designed to challenge your skill with gliding through spiked mazes are the worst part of the game. Can be much more insanely tedious without health buffs or perks.\n-(POSSIBLE SPOILER?) In the end of each chapter there are long challenges, almost entirely time-trial style. There are no checkpoints, and you will be tearing your hair out when you get snagged by something for the 30th time, and get sent to the beginning again.\n\nAll in all, the game is a masterpiece platformer. Even the cons are barely drawbacks, because it encourages you to explore (which I did almost instinctively, because the game is FUN) and stock up bonuses to prepare for a less-stressful next-chapter.

The art-design of the world within is a masterpiece, the lights, the colours, the feel of the life within the forrest. Gameplay fluidness and dinamics makes this game easy and hard @the same time. Musics are still following me in my days, can't throw em out of my head. Whoever wrote, composed and executed them are pure geniuses.\n\nThank you Moon for this experience.","March 26, 2015","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Can be tough at times, but I think the difficulty is perfect. Love the story, game progression, all of it. I was skeptical about paying $20 for a platformer, but it was certainly worth it.\n\nWish there was a co-op mode, but aside from that this game is practically flawless.","March 26, 2015","true","44.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's visuals, score, and subtle story telling serve as an excellent draw to a demanding, precise, and incredibly rewarding platformer.\nAs the game opens up, you start with a basic collection of platforming abilities, but over time the gameplay becomes rich with options. By the end, you are juggling nearly a dozen abilities to get through increasinly challenging levels, many with their own environmental mechanics that play off of your character's abilities rather cleverly. Driven  along by the game's stunning aesthetic and wonderful music, the came keeps all your senses occupied.\nThere are some minor quirks to the gameplay. The control scheme could use some tweaking, or at least allow for customization. Some of the visual element, particularly the bloom and attack effects, tend to obscure the action a little too much, especially in combat. It's frustrating when you can't see enemy projectiles because the air between you and them is filled with blue energy.\nThere are a few incredibly demanding, lengthy sequences that may not be to some players' liking. You will probably die a lot and the sequences, for those not especially good at platforming, can take a long time to complete, despite the actual sequence in full taking maybe a minute to complete. These sequences also tend to be very trial and error based, juxtaposed by a very easy to read level design philosophy throughout the normal areas of the game.\nMy last issue with the game is probably my biggest. You cannot return to the game once you complete it. So if you want to 100% everything, do it when you get all the abilities from the trees. It's fairly easy and rewarding to find all of the hidden locations and orbs so I do recomend it.\nOverall, I found this game to be thouroughly enjoyable, gorgeous to look at, and extremely touching. I normally cannot stand 2D platformers, but the art and intro was enough to convince me to give it a try. I'm extremely glad I did and I've grown an appreciation for the genre that wasn't there before.","March 26, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Which made me leery of buying it. I didnt want so spend 20 dollars on another game like that. However it is much more action based. It is a very elaborately animated game with a great sound track. I havent beaten it yet but everything I have seen so far I have enjoyed. It can be very challenging at times, especially for the not so great at platformers player. I had a bit of an issue getting the game to run however. I had to verify the game to get it to launch consistently. Plus I noticed that running the game in fullscreen would cause the pictire to flicker durring parts of cut scenes and while looking at the map also it would stutter slightly while playing. That stutter can make it very hard to time maneuvers. The game in all regards ran much better while in windowed mode, but I didnt want to play with those edges on my screen. After making a post though I discoved that using the launch option -popupwindow corrected the performace problem. I would say this game is a good buy for the price, even though I am concerned that it may not be as long as I would like. As I said before though, I havent beaten it yet.\n\nJust completed my first playthrough. At a play time of 8hrs 40min I'd consider that rather short. But I am not disappointed. The 20 dollars was well spent in my mind. If you aren't willing to pay that much you should deffinately watch for this one to go on sale. Very good game.","March 15, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm in the video games industry and I could only dream of working on such a title. Every single background is mind-blowing, the gameplay is very responsive and enjoyable, the storyline focuses on very deep and meaningful themes (mostly life, death, and sacrifice), and the soundtrack is breathtaking. It feels like Metroid about how the entire map is designed (you go back and forth, finally reaching bonuses thanks to the latest upgrade you unlocked), and there is definitely something of Rayman Origins/Legends in how this game is played. Your character levels up and gains new abilities throughout the entire game. Choices don't seem to matter that much at first but it's because you actually improve your skills while progressing into the game, without even noticing. I'm stating the obvious here, but a gamepad is mandatory. I had a few bugs with my Xbox One gamepad though (3 freezes during the game, probably because I pressed too many buttons, and a recurring issue while trying to load my game).\n\nThe game is not perfect but it's as close as it can get in my opinion. Yes it's a bit short (10 hours on my part and I almost reached 100% on the first run), yes some people will find the game too easy (the last part of each dungeon can be quite tricky though, casual players may have a hard time on these). The only things I didn't like in this game is it's impossible to come back in certain areas (dungeons usually lock once you've been there), and the fact that the game has no replay value. Yet, nothing game-breaking. The game is still VERY enjoyable (truth be told, I cried 3 times!). It's an amazing game and it's totally worth its full price. It's a gaming experience I'll probably never forget, and that says a lot... Buy it, enjoy it, even cry a bit in between if you want, replay it 5 years later. 10/10, hands down. I would buy a sequel on its release without any hesitation.","March 21, 2015","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"
