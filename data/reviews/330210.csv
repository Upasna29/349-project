Save your money and wait to see what happens in the next couple months.\n\nI'm personally shafted on a refund on this game even though what they sold me is not what they are planning on shipping. I played more than 2 hours and it's more than the 14 days since I purchased.

At first, a steady stream of improvements to the shoddy gameplay kept me interested. The dev reacted to forum posts with relevant posts.\n\nThen forum replies became shorter and more generic. "Thank you - we thought of that too". Then the updates stopped completely, and now it feels like the devs have scooped up the early acces revenues and went on a nice vacation.\nNo replies in the forums for a month or so, no updates, no news... There is just silence.\n\nIn this state the game is not finished and running around the map has no point. Because of this, nobody logs in, and the game is empty. No players, no goal. A huge potential though, and lots of ideas and input from the community. Unfortunately Salty does not seem to work on the game anymore.\n\nAtari and Steam have both attached their name and reputation to this, so I did not expect to lose my 30 EUR this easy.

They're still selling this game, and Atari is still advertising it on its website, but the servers have been inaccessible since about the 15th of May. That means the game is unplayable. There has been no communication  or updates from the developers since April. Again. Avoid like the plague. It is, or rather was, an online game, and without servers, you cannot play. Game is dead.

I'm currently studying Game Programming, and I could quite easily make this game (minus the art assets) fairly quickly...... I'd be genuinely suprised if there are more than 2 people working on this game......\n\nI understand if the Developer wants to get their game out there on the market and see what the public thinks about their concept....... but they should at least scale the price accordingly....... I mean USD$30 ...... SUCH A ******* RIP-OFF!\nMaybe $10 dead max would be suitable..... I'd even suggest the price to be set to $2.00 for the "wonderful" 5 minutes of gameplay that this game provides...........\n\nOpen World - Hardly..... you'd die of suffocation before you get more than 200m away from your base......\nSandbox - Nope... You build a base of set components that don't even do anything ..... and the only thing that you can mine is asteroids that you shoot down (with crappy hit-boxes ..so half the time your bullets go straight through them too...) ...definitely NOT sandbox.\nSurvival Game - Yeah... pretty much the only thing you can do is die. Suffocate, get hit by an asteroid, pvp? Maybe? I mean... you have a gun............. but that's about as far as that goes.....\n\nThere are about 25 different servers - 3 of them had 1 person online each. Multiplayer..?

You have limited oxygen which forces you to manage your mining runs intelligently. The survival is made more intense by the meteor bombardment which can kill you or destroy your HQ and other structures. If this is the taste of what the dev has in store for us then I am very excited for what’s about to come. The game is still in Pre-Alpha stage so a bit of patience is required to experience the potential and fun.","March 27, 2015","true","31.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Sorry the game needs more to it than just shooting rocks, a bit exspensive for 2 hours of game time.","March 26, 2015","false","4.0"," 25 of 53 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","25","53","0","0"

Yep its definately early access, I've had a few crashes and got stuck in some Quartz once but there's the core of a nice game in here. The graphics are not bad either.\n\nI made a video of my early stages of playing this game, see what you think.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/Sks4psFWg78\n\n(The video is taking an age to process at YouTubes end, so it may not be available at top quality as I type this, check back later if its not. Youtube need to replace the dusty old 286's they have in their server farm).\n","March 29, 2015","true","6.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It's like looking at nudes from your ex and then calling her to come over. Yeah sure the menu looks pretty, but when you get the actual serving it's like feces boiled in a rusty microwave.\n\nThis piece of code is a mess. I have hardly played 90 minutes and I have already managed to be defiled in so many ways I am applying for therapy first thing tommorow. The abuse includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- Fallen through the map\n- Gamecrash 6 times. Every time I alt-tab as well (excluded)\n- Gotten killed bhy an astroid, respawned and being completely unable to ever buy any upgrade ever again, or customize character\n- Had a vehicle spasm to the end of the earth\n- Been able to build a huge base for free\n- Not been able to remove any parts of my own\n- Had animations suspended or frozen completely\n- Randomly dissconnected\n- Respawned inside a turret, unable to move\n- Built a building, on top of a building, making the topmost building almost inaccessable\n- Not been able to open the map, ever\n\nWithin 90 minutes! This is not an "oh it's an alpha you need to accept some bugs" case. This is a product exchanged for legal tender that is absolutely unplayable.\n\nI feel violated. It's like they sent a throbbing train with houndreds of wrecked monster trucks loaded on it through my pie–outlet. One after another, never stopping until my intenstines and contents flew out of my oval office with the force of an anal tornado. Like a starved hyena for some orignality in the gaming world, we hunger still.","March 27, 2015","false","1.6"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","43","13","30","18","0"

The game sure has a lot of potential, but you should wait for a more playable build before stepping in. All in all, it can become really fun someday.\n\nPS: Although the game is in Early Access, is far early in development then most games in EA. I've not paid for the game.","March 26, 2015","false","0.8"," 22 of 52 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","22","52","0","0"

I had to restart multiple times during my short play through.\n\nFrom what i saw during my time ingame, if it works there’s a lot of promise, its very pretty and quite fun to shoot down/collect the resources but till it’s more polished i couldn’t recommend buying unless you have money to burn","March 26, 2015","false","1.2"," 18 of 44 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","18","44","2","0"
