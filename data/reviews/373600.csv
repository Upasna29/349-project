Surprise! Surprise! Humanity is doomed unless the Solus Operatives can do something about it. With your help, Earth could be saved for a day or two. You know, at least until the next alien invasion. Combining striking visuals, interesting weapons, and run & gun shootemup action, Weapon of Choice is a pretty memorable experience.\n\nThere is a lot that's unique about this game. There are 7 stages, but your average play-through takes place over 2 or 3 of them. Admittedly, this decision is pretty strange. Usually action games - even if they have branching paths - consist of 5 or more stages. I suppose it works due to the variety of environments and enemies. Each branch changes things up, and the operatives you control can have different effects on the mission. The replay-value is further improved by a selection of difficulties. Since the good guys die in a single hit, the harder settings are a bit more creative in their implementation. You won't see boring changes like "good guys take more damage". The harder settings have enemies exhibit different behaviors, fire more projectiles, drop menacing saw-blades, and so on.\n\nChoosing the Operative that fits your play-style is something to consider. Each of them have their own weapons and special maneuvers. Everyone also carries a back-up gun. Unlike the main weapon, this machine-gun has an attachment that allows the player to move it around. So if you need to shoot an enemy that's around a corner, behind a post, or in some other hard-to-reach area, you can count on this gun. Experimentation is just one of the many keys to success. Xerxes carries a flame-thrower. When using the ALT-FIRE (hold the right-trigger) and jumping, Xerxes will soar through the air, like he just turned on his afterburner.\n\nOverall though, I'll say that I didn't have too much difficulty with this game. I started with the easiest setting, played through all of the stages, then immediately jumped to the hardest. I've lost a few operatives on each path, but I never got a game over. Even without "death-brushing", you'll survive as long as you take it slow and destroy everything. I think going for "no-miss" campaigns could be a worthy challenge though. Speedrunning the game would be interesting as well, especially with the unique movement abilities everyone has.\n\nWeapon of Choice is a fascinating shootemup. Along with the vivid graphics, there are some cool weapons to play around with, and the bosses are impressively designed. It is very short though, and is oddly more expensive than Mommy's Best Games other recent releases. If you haven't already purchased one or two of the other games, I advise that you should just grab the bundle. For a few dollars more you get four good games. It's a reasonable value.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","October 19, 2015","true","5.2"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","2"

Love the metal sound track and the graphics are absolutely stunning!! Way better than what you see in the demo. Such attention to detail and huge cool bosses!!. See that means the devs really care about what type of product they are putting out and that means a lot to me. I just love little small details in the back ground. Trees swaying, enemies breathing all that. Controls great too with a Xbox controller.Kind of reminds me of the old school Contra for the SNES. Great selection of weapons and characters too. And what a steal at only $4.99!! I could say more but i'm about to dive deeper into this sweet little game!! Go buy this game and support these devs!!

You can often see several font styles on a screen, sometimes hard to read. It's not very pleasing to my eye but surely corresponds the feeling of being on another planet. The engine works fine on a weak laptop and it's got cool features like complex weapon mechanics, climbing walls with robotic spider hands, object interaction physics, automatic bullet time when a character's death is close. The only gripe from me is that you can't scorch the flora with a flamethrower - plants shake when you touch'em but stay indestructible in a fiery hurricane.\n\nThere are no lives, just several chars who could be delivered to the place by rocket, and we can enlarge their numbers by saving new ones in the process. Everyone's got his own favorite gun with 2 action modes & special moves on doublejump. The bestiary gives me creeps, they made some really cool monsters! There's also a non-linear story, some choices may exclude certain levels from your playthrough. With the amount of random interactions which could happen during a fight, I think it offers enough replayability. All in all I recommend you to try this just for its originality, in this old genre we don't get much unusual stuff.\n\n<russian>\nВнешний вид этого произведения несколько противоречив - размытые кислотные текстуры, будто нарисованные ребенком, соседствуют здесь с четкими контурами, интересными моделями персонажей и впечатляющими эффектами. Часто можно видеть разные шрифтовые стили на одном экране, не всегда легко читаемые. Выглядит на мой вкус не очень приятно, но безусловно передает чувство присутствия на другой планете. Движок работает здорово на слабом ноуте, и у него прикольные возможности типа сложной механики оружия, лазания по стенам при помощи механических рук, физики взаимодействия с объектами, авто замедления времени при приближении смерти. Единственная жалоба - нельзя спалить траву огнеметом - она шевелится от соприкосновений, но остается нерушимой в огненном вихре.\n\nТут нет жизней, просто несколько героев, которых доставляют на место ракетой, и их число можно увеличить, спасая новых в процессе. У каждого своя любимая пушка с 2 режимами и специальные движения в двойном прыжке. Зоопарк пробирает до мурашек, чудовища сделаны классно! Также присутствует нелинейный сюжет, некоторые выборы могут исключить определенные уровни из вашего прохождения. С тем объемом случайностей, что ждет нас в боях, думаю, здесь достаточно потенциала для повторных прохождений. В целом я рекомендую вам попробовать хотя бы ради оригинальности, в этом старом жанре необычные вещи редко встречаются.","January 27","true","2.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Like its descendent Weapon of Choice is a Contra-esque side-scrolling "run-n-gun", but best played (assuming you're using a controller) with a "twin stick" scheme, with the left analog used for movement, the right for aiming and shooting, and the shoulder/trigger buttons for other functions. Moreover, WoC helps to showcase what would become the developer's instantly-recognizable brand of creatively gaudy visual flair and dark but good-natured humor which would prove a perfect match for Sam.\n\nAs the title suggests, the main draw here is the playable selection of hapless commandos and their ludicrous individualized weaponry, from jet engine flamethrowers to lightsaber chainsaws - while some armaments are more useful in certain situations than others, everybody can switch to a more-or-less "normal" machine gun if they need something more general-use. You only have a couple of soldiers to choose from at first, but MIAs are waiting to be rescued in several of the game's levels, and your handy standard-issue "spiderpack" allows you to climb almost any wall and ceiling in search of them (and the occasional delicious pie). Each member of the crew has a different double-jump ability as well, so you'll want to find and try them all.\n\nThat being said, doing so isn't likely to take you too long, since the game encompasses fewer than ten levels total, and due to its branching path structure you'll only see three of them per playthrough. On the bright side, there are a wide selection of difficulty levels to unlock if you want to (re)test your mettle; when you're first getting started things are relatively breezy thanks to the game's "death brush" mechanic (if something's about to hit you time slows down, usually allowing you to weasel your way out of danger), but go up high enough and not only do enemies and obstacles become more difficult but "death brushing" is out the window, so you'll be burning through your one-hit-and-they're-dead ranks quickly even with the ability to pick up and rescue a downed character once the next one shows up (in an exploding rocket, of course).\n\nWhile we're on the topic, I'd be remiss not to devote a few words to the game's unmistakable sense of style. Sure, you've basically got another "shoot all the meanie-face aliens" situation on your hands, but when said aliens (particularly the bosses) are as freakish, silly, and invariably bursting with rainbow goo as they are here you'll still enjoy filling them with hot lead/plasma/spinny blades/etc. Oh, and did I mention you're taking orders from a commander who bears a striking resemblance to a noted actor, disease mispronouncer and oatmeal spokesperson? Couple that with entertainingly droll (and skippable) bits of text, a cheese-rock soundtrack, bold colors and smooth animations and you've got a game that's fun to watch as well as play, though a handful of improvements (faster walking speed chief among them) also make for a better behind-the-controller experience than before.\n\nAs such, it's not a big name like Serious Sam, and isn't as expansive or ambitious as Double D turned out to be, but one can't really blame the game nor its circumstances for that; if you enjoyed that game, or were at least somehow curious about it, I recommend giving this one a try as well. It's a bit more expensive then the other XBLIG-to-Steam ports    Mommy's Best Games has engineered, so if WoC is on your wishlist you might want to go ahead and grab the full package, which gets you three additional games for a measly buck apiece. If you do, any time you ever need a few minutes to let off some stress and cause some nutty mayhem without being led away in a straitjacket, you're all set to go.","October 5, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keidrych/recommended/373600/","keidrych","Keyed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keidrych/","409 products in account","Weapon of choice is a very original and beautiful 2D shooter. Though I'm not a fan of most shooters where you can die in one hit, as it can oftentimes feel 'unfair', this game has a system I quite like called death-touching. Basically, when you're about to be killed by something time will slow down to allow you to focus on survival until you're escaped the threat. Despite this though, the game can be quite hard, especially on the higher difficulty settings.\n\nThe lives system is quite original as well. You have several operatives to choose from when you start a mission, each with their own unique primary weapon and double-jump. When an operative is shot or otherwise maimed, another is deployed, and you can have the new operative rescue the old one by carrying them on their back. You can only carry one though, so if you die multiple times in a level you'll have to choose which one you want to save in order to use them again later.\n\nAlthough short, this game offers branching paths that lead to 4 endings (one secret), and each level is packed with some of the most original and gross enemy designs I've ever seen. If you're a fan of old-school shooters, I recommend this game heartily.","November 9, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd go as far as calling it 'good enough'.\n\nThe gameplay is kind of generic. Very simple.\n\nThe story is.... Kinda blah. Nothing special.\n\nThe art style is vibrant and very alien/mutant. Interesting monsters and bosses. Big plus there.\n\nIt's got interesting gameplay mechanics, like the 'rescue system' where you find an ally and carry them to safety. And, the spider-pack was kinda fun. No more obscure firing angles!\n\nThe near miss 'death brushing' system was definitely interesting. I don't recall anything else like it.\n\nUnusual characters with vastly differening weapon and play styles. Kinda nice. Just needs MORE characters!\n\nThe game is short. Crazy short. Replayability and branching paths only go so far.\n\nBut my favorite feature of the game?\n\nThe BRUTAL FREAKING METAL SOUNDTRACK!!!!!!!\n\nA lot of love went into the soundtrack and I was more than happy to slap down the 2 extra bucks to get it. It is good, classic, hard and fast metal. The way metal should be. Especially action-game music. Really driving and invigorating.\n\nThe music saved this game, by me.\n\n7/10~ Will play again if more content/sequel comes out.\n\nSeriously. The music is awesome.
