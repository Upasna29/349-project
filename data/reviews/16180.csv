Takes micro managing to the extreme, as food sources can completely vanish and leave you with an elder and two children to run the entire village. I remember it being more fun as a child, but possibly because it was only played in five minute increments. The fact that it can't be paused and runs even while closed is another bad point. Leave the game alone for a day, and you come back to a dead village.","June 25, 2014","false","22.7"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","14","31","0","5"
