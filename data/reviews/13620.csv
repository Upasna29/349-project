Though there aren't as many missions as with the first Ghost Recon, the missions are harder, and take a bit longer to complete.\nThis "Desert Siege" mod is just an advancement on the fun of the original "Ghost Recon."\nDon't hesitate to buy this!","January 16, 2014","true","2.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","2"

If you don't own the original; shame on you. Pick up Ghost Recon and the expansion in one swoop.Even without the numerous enhancements, tweaks, and goodies, Desert Siege is worth its price for the mission editor alone.The desert settings are a great addition to the game integrating that all important immersive feeling of actually "being there."It also features some subtle but important improvements to the original gameplay that make Ghost Recon a more polished and enjoyable game as a whole.","February 27, 2014","true","6.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/m_khokhar/recommended/13620/","m_khokhar","Mohsin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/m_khokhar/","44 products in account","Ghost Recon: Desert Siege expands the world of Ghost Recon from Eastern Europe to the deserts of Africa. Small tweaks to the game make this a worthy addition to the original Ghost Recon. In comparison to the original game, the maps are also larger fitting into the desert theme. The long distance engagements can actually be quite interesting because more often than not, you are spotted in the wide open and there is little or no cover in some areas so approaching the situation is quite important.\n\nThis is definitely a worthy addition to the original Ghost Recon game. Anybody who is interested in highly tactical games and already has the core game would adore this expansion. And if you don’t have the original, get on that because you’re definitely missing out.","April 20, 2015","true","5.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Yep, still same tactical shooter. It added new single-player campaign, new weapons and expanded multiplayer.\n\nWell, since multiplayer is kinda dead, you probably not going to care about those two new modes. However, you can play 5 multiplayer maps in custom mission if you choose Firefight or Recon mods.\nAlso I didn't notice new weapons personally. I mean, how different they can be from whatever realistical weapons Ghost Recon already had.\n\nBut it does add a new single-player campaign made up of 8 missions. And this time things are going south, from cold Russia itno whatever hot African country, where you will be annoying everybody off by the border. Yep, it's still same Ghost Recon gameplay in different enviroment. Still with frustating AI, with enemies now even more happy to throw grenades that teammates AI doesn't bother to avoid, feeling sometimes unfair. Still quickscamming.\nIt doesn't add new gameplay elements, the only new thing are enemy jeeps, which have driver and machine gunner. They can screw you up and are nice addition. But it's puzzling that Demolition's anti-armor weapon is useless against jeep. I mean, direct hit may not even harm everybody in a jeep. It should blow up!\n\nBut the levels themselves felt much better designed around Ghost Recon gameplay. They are now much more wide open, consisting of huge spaces. And I feel it makes it more pleasent to deal with teammate AI, as they are much better at providing support and cover over such distances. While you place them around to cover each other and move on slowly, taking baddies out from a far. Unless you once again have to enter building with only one path where you get one-shot instantly. Missions also didn't try to be gimmicky, the only armor escort mission has a very slow-moving convoy.\n\nAnd well, this expansion is good. At least if you liked the original. Overall I think I had more positive experience with Desert Siege's 8 missions than with original's 15 levels.","October 16, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

MP is classic. and for 2001 its pretty good. except the rugged geometry, the sprite explosions. the rough models. and the lens flare sun. OK so this isnt BF3. but BF3 aint no GR. If you are a fan of tactical shooters then you have already played this and I dont need to remind you of how good it is. Revisiting it is fun. and is still worth gathering a bunch of friends together for a no spawn elite run. dont forget the vent.\n\n7.0/10 (expansions included)","March 24, 2013","true",""," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There is only one convoy escort mission, and there aren't many engagements with armored units to be had. There are fewer specialists and weapons available.  Even as someone who prefers an infantry focus and long distance engagements, I didn't like it much. The package isn't complete without it, though.","September 19, 2014","true","0.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
