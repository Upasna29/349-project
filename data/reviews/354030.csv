This is really terrible design.\nWeird difficulty - levels can be a joke, or very hard, or in between at random. No curve, which ruins any feeling of progression.\nSamey music and just not enough tracks\n\nUltimately though, the movement in this game is really weird and after a half hour of playing I still hadn't really nailed down what the distinction between attempts that failed or succeeded were. Got exhausted on level 27 where I died more than the preceeding 26 levels and just bored of the game.","November 7, 2015","false","3.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

However, the game is exceptional for it's price there are still some pro's and con's which I will list below.\n\nPros:\n\n♦ Great Price\n♦ Good amount of Content\n♦ Challenging and Fun\n♦ Nice Number of Built in Awardments\n♦ Awesome Graphics and fitting Music\n♦ Each level is Unique\n♦ Decent number of Enemies to verse\n♦ Puns before Levels that actually link to things that have happened outside the game (This keeps the game interesting)\n♦ Easy Controls that just seem to work\n♦ Decent Jumpbox (No delay, no over jumping for no reason etc)\n♦ Interesting Intro Story\n♦ Good Number of Easy Steam Achievements (Just gotten from playing the Game)\n♦ Awesome Looking Steam Cards/Emoticons/Backgrounds\n♦ Good replay value due to highscores\n♦ Friendly Dev who listens to players/community!\n\nCons:\n♦ If you Quit at Level 21 and Exit the game and come back to play again, it will crash at level select (However, this is inconvenient it is fixable if you select level 21 really quick before the error message appears)\n♦ Steals a lot of concepts from Mario (Such as Final Boss, the Spikey Blocks that fall on you and the Angry Sun design + more)\n♦ The puns before each level tend to repeat a fair bit (Would be awesome if all 60 levels had their own Pun including Expert levels having their own)\n♦ Can collect gems after you've touched the flag (Such as level 16) and shows that you've collected all gems in the ingame information but it doesn't recognise that you've collected all gems for that level\n♦ Hit Box on the Spiked Sun Face looking things is way off\n♦ Ending for both Normal and Expert is lame wall of text (Could be way better concidering Intro was alright)\n\nOverall, even though there are a number of cons (Most of the cons are minor bugs or things that could be improved to make the game better) this is a great game, with hours of fun content at an awesome price with most of the gameplay being exceptional. Therefore, for the $3 you'll spend on this, you'll defently get your moneys worth and you should pick up a copy if you like Fast Paced, Collect Em All, Dodge Em, Platformers.","August 9, 2015","true","6.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","0"

The game starts off fairly easy, but quickly intesifies and it turns into a bit of a "Rager"  lol\n\nIf you enjoy oldschool platforming where precise jump and timing is key, then give this game a go.  I am a retro gamer so this game was quite fun for me.  I can only imagine how difficult the levels get as I progress further.\n\nIf you wish to see the stream video I ddi on this game, here is a link ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsAtJkJL0lI","November 9, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/354030/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2518 products in account","VolChaos is an old-school platformer that reminds me of an Amiga 500 game.\n\nI almost want to recommend the game just to give a big thumbs-up for the great level names, which reminded me fondly of the old mutant camels games (though VolChaos is nothing like them), but after having played for just under five hours, and having rage-quit many times during that (almost all on level 27), I just don't find VolChaos fun to play, and other than fun I can't see that it offers anything else.\n\nThe game is mostly well done, with good pixel graphics and a vast array of levels. However, the levels vary wildly in difficulty with no discernible curve leading from easier levels to harder ones, and relying on replay after replay of the same level in order to gain longevity does not lead to a fun game. Some levels are obviously designed to foil early attempts, requiring blind leaps of faith, which is not great level design in my opinion.\n\nTo be fair, the game's description does say it is "ultra-challenging", but ti seemed to me that most of the challenge was had from trying to master the player's inertia and remember the tricky bits from the previous attempts at each level, rather than through any devious or clever level design. I had some fun, but unfortunately not enough. I suspect a reordering of the levels would help immensely. As it is, I couldn't bring myself to keep bashing my head against level 27. I knew what I had to do, but the controls just wouldn't let me do it.\n\nGrab VolChaos if it's on deep discount or in a bundle and you enjoy a bit of reminiscing over platform game rage. But if you play games to enjoy yourself, it's probably best to give this one a miss.","December 30, 2015","false","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With my background and recommendations from others I decided to play Volchaos with a controller. I will be writing this review from the view of a xbox controller.\n\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game is fun. It passes time quickly and I find myself not getting frustrated with the levels if they require me trying over and over to complete. As for how far I am in the game the levels are not crazy hard to the point were I feel that I have no chance in actually beating the level, the levels always fell beatable. As I worked my way through to the point that I am now in Volchaos I saw the level design change as my skill set evolved. As for the controls, (a) is jump and (x) is replay, something that you will probably be pressing a lot when playing. When moving though the levels, I found myself using the dpad button to move instead of using the analog joystick. People talk about the bad controls but I found them easy to get used to as you went along playing the game.\n\n\n\nBugs:\n\nI think for an early access game I should put this here to point out problems. (if I find any more major one then I put them here)\n\n1) When booting the game it often crashes the first boot... the second boot starts the game more times than not though.\n\n\n\nThe verdict:\n\nFor 2.99... yes! I have enjoyed all the time that I have played so far and I am sure that I will continue to play and enjoy the game in the future.","November 15, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The games objective is to reach the flag at each of the 60 levels. While it starting of fairly easy, it gradually becomes harder and harder to achieve this goal. However, I felt that each death was due to my own shortcoming and not becomes of the game's slippery controls or some weird mechanics. The music is kept rather simple but never really felt repetative to me. Controls are precise and smooth. Play with a controller for your best experience.","February 7","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
