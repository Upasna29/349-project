I don't make forum posts, I don't leave reviews.\n\nThat being said, the Dev and his game are more than deserving of a positive review, here is my reasoning;\n\nOriginally, I had a lot of difficulty getting the game to work. In fact I was pretty P*ssed about it.\nThe Dev (Corrosion) and his Admin (Zelp) were both very responsive and attempted to help in anyway they could.\nIn fact I was surprised to receive help from these guys at all, I'd expected it to be another user who played  Waste Walkers. Yet Corrosion, despite being on vacation, continued to message with however he could help.\nBig companies need to take a note from this guy's book.\n\nThe game itself isn't as casual as I thought it would be, in fact I underestimated it in thinking it would be easy, but this is a pleasant surprise even if I did die because I used up my stamina and couldn't run away fast enough!\n(Remember to save your game guys)\n\nIt contains many survival elements of your average survival game without so much complexity it makes your brain want to cook itself. The game stays true to it's TAGS, having all the RPG elements of a traditional RPG game, some action and adventure. I even broke down a fence and met some git who wanted to charge me 250 for his 'Services'.\n\nAnyway, the game isn't expensive and I think you should all check it out if you're into some semi-casual, RPG, turn-based action.\n\nNow, I haven't played the game long, so I will potentially update this review because I feel like there is far more to the game than what I have seen so far. It gives off that feel, if that's anything to go by.","July 9, 2015","true","4.3"," 130 of 152 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","130","152","10","6"

I also didn't experience any CTD's or similar during my play time.\n\nThe general Fallout/Stalker style gameplay of surviving and exploring is there, but unfortunately it just wasn't any fun, and for £6.99 that's not gonna fly, maybe at about £1.99 it would feel like decent value.\n\nIgnore the feature list on the store page as it's all made up of the devs warped opinion of his own  game (brilliant sounds, beautiful environments etc etc, none of which are even close to the mark) and pure fiction (equivalent to 90KM of land to traverse (its actually only 120x120 meters with roughly 100 buildings)\n\nA lot of the tiles (floor sprites, building sprites etc) used are of low quality and make the general game world look ugly and messy (unfortunately not in a good post-apocalyptic way).\nThe world itself is tiny, it took me 64 seconds to walk from the very west to the very east of the map and 70 seconds to walk from the very north to the very south. There are multiple buildings scattered around, some of which are enterable, but most of which consist of 1 floor with a few rooms seperated by ugly looking walls and doors.\nFollowed the main quest for the hour that i played, felt very bare bones and generic in terms of actual story, on about the same level as a short story written as a homework assignment.\n\nStandard key binds are pretty bad and the controls screen shows no way of rebinding, however pressing f1 brought up a window allowing me to assign keys to a gamepad (doesnt work), rebind keyboard keys and also turn on/off the music etc. None of this mentioned in the controls screen however. Also, when playing in full screen the mouse cursor can dissappear off to the right and off the bottom of the screen, which at first made me think the mouse just didnt work in Waste Walkers.\n\n"Developer" also likes to tell people their feedback is just plain wrong and that he has done everything right, even down to the fact that the controller support is borked and his reply was "well i decided to put game "features" in instead of fixing game pad, anyways this is on PC and all PC players use the keyboard and mouse", as well many other examples which you can see on peoples reveiws and in the games forums on steam.\n\nTL:DR - At a price point of £7 i simply can't recommend Waste Walkers considering its super small world, poor story, poor tile/sprite choice and a Dev who tells you your feedback is wrong, the way you played his game was wrong and that he has done everything correct. Avoid.","December 2, 2015","false","0.9"," 137 of 206 people (67%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","67","137","206","11","44"

It's fun to roam around the city, especially at low levels and alone when every encounter can be potentially life-ending. Combat is unforgiving when you don't have a gun or the ammo to use it, meaning that you need to be judicious where and when you fight. It also has a nice post-apocalyptic vibe to it.\n\nSo that's what's good. Past a certain point, the open exploration with little guidance starts to become frustrating. One of the selling points of this game was that you can establish your own colony, which is nice and thematic. However, I've spent eight hours on the game, crawled over the map, and found nothing. None of the characters have ever mentioned it to me either, so I guess I could keep playing if I just wanted to crawl the map endlessly looking for it.\n\nSpeaking of which, the map they provide in the game is fairly useless. Unless you're standing at the margins of the map, it's hard to get a real sense for where you are until you've effectively memorized the relations of where everything is anyway. I know that might be realistic, but in a game where things are abstractly rendered at best, it makes finding your way around really difficult. Why not a coordinate system?\n\nQuest marking, or even writing it down in the journal you have would be a tremendous help too. There's something infuriating in finishing a quest and then not remembering where the quest giver was, leading you to wander the map just to find them.\n\nScavenging is also too effective. My strategy of looting every container and reselling what I didn't need (revolutionary, I know) left me with so many tabs that I could effectively buy everything my main character needed and have plenty left over. My safe was stocked to the gills with everything I could ever need, although the fact that it doesn't sort goods at all for you means that finding anything was incredibly difficult.\n\nMaybe if I was anal retentive I would need to buy everything for my NPCs, but only one of them can fight with you at a time, and some are far, far better than others. (Was Nadia supposed to be useful? I got her up to level 5 and she never did more than a point of damage). Once you get a gun and enough ammo, which is easy because money is no issue, just make you sure you have an NPC who can use one, and fights will never be a real challenge again.\n\nThe story is nothing to write home about. A man kidnaps your family, you go after him, revenge, blah blah blah. Not bad, but nothing special, and its non-linearity makes it easy to forget it ever happened.\n\nThis game was fun for a while, but I happened to buy it when I desperately needed short distractions. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't spend $10 on this, so unfortunately I can't recommend this.","December 5, 2015","false","8.2"," 42 of 55 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","42","55","4","4"

Waste Walkers is a Dystopian RPG game where you play a survivor trying to survive in the ruins.  Along the way, you'll encounter mutants, bandits, and feral animals roaming the cityscape.  You'll find your fair share of allies if you prove yourself useful and plenty of unique places to explore.\n\nWaste Walkers uses the RPG Maker engine, though heavily modified by scripts.  I have no problem with this, but some people are very opinionated on it, so I'm mentioning it here so you won't be 'surprised.'\n\nThings you'll find in this game:Visible enemy encounters. There are also some 'random' encounters, but these are rare enough that they aren't intrusive and serve very well at keeping you from becoming complacent.\nA large variety of combat weapons to suit style, each with their own individual stats affecting Accuracy, Speed, and ability to inflict nasty things like Bleeding, Stunning, and loss of teeth.\nA Level up System allowing customization of Stats encompassing Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, and Constitution.\nA skill system utilizing Passive Skills and Techniques for combat.  In addition, there are Weapon Specific techniques depending on the death-dealer you have equipped.  Got a Longbow, you can make a Pinning Shot to lower an enemy's Dex and Speed.  Got an Assault Rifle, fire off a Burst of 3 rounds at once.  So far, the Techniques pale in comparision to building up Passives but at this stage it's easy to see that things are being worked on.\nScaling enemies.  Enemies appear to go up in levels based on yours, though also based on their location.  The Bandits near your starting HQ stay between Lv.2 and 5 or so, elsewhere they go from Lv.3 to 6 in places.  Obviously balancing encounters and keeping them challenging is important.\n\nOther things I'll comment on are the writing.  The text is clean and easy to follow.  The locations are all unique even amongst incredibly similar areas or businesses.  You won't run into 3 different buildings and find the same generic 'Warehouse'.  While you might not always find a building full of loot, you will know the difference between the Hardware Store, the Thrift Store, and the Pawn Shop.\n\nWith full release, there's plenty of side quests and activities to roam around and get involved in as you seek out the fate of your family and how they've fared.  All-in-all, a solid game for the price and a good start for the developer in forging a portfolio of future games.","August 5, 2015","true","151.0"," 45 of 65 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","45","65","3","0"

That said, I truly see a good promise in Waste Walkers.\n\nThe game is about a Wanderer (you, the player) who must explore the wastes and attempt to survive. Currently there's no real over-arching story to follow, but there is plenty of quests for players to engage in and places to explore.\n\nYou go throughout the game, searching buildings for anything you can find to sell and acquire better gear, or even craft it yourself. You have freedom over what you do inside the game and can be a scavenger who engages in no combat, or a strong-arm with a partner-in-crime that you've hired or found to join you.\n\nBattles in this game are tough and the developer is continually attempting to make them harder on the player, mainly because I've expressed how simple the combat becomes when you get the best gear on your party.\n\nI've had a lot of fun with Waste Walkers and hope to have even more when the game is fully completed and sports plenty of content and a huge city to explore.\n\nI recommend this game for purchase. It's definitely worth it. It's not an average JRPG made with RPG Maker.","June 1, 2015","true","18.8"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","0"

I'm usually cautious when it comes to early access games, but I'm not worried about this one at all.  The developer posted updates every day (sometimes several in one day) while it was on Greenlight, and actively sought out suggestions from the community.  He's also active in the game's forum.\n\nThe game doesn't have a whole lot of content yet, since it just came out and it is early access.  But what's in it so far is a lot of fun, and shows a lot of promise.\n\nCreating a character only takes a few seconds.   You can choose gender, race and name (try naming your character Waste Walker). You can also distribute attribute points and choose a skill or two. The skills range from passive abilities that will help you survive battles, to fighting techniques that will help you win battles.\n\nThe ruined city is open-world, so you can roam around checking things out as much as you like.  But the dark fog that constantly surrounds you (you can turn the fog off in the options) and the eerie music creates a real sense of dread. What you do see is blood and destruction, wrecked cars and rubble.  When you turn a corner and bandits run towards you from the shadows, you'll wonder if you'll survive the encounter. You might not...\n\nThe sense of urgency from the environment isn't the only survival aspect:  There's also a food/drink system.  If you want to live, you have to scavenge.  (Like the fog effect, the need for food/water can be turned off in the options menu, but  turning it off takes something from the feel of the game.)   You can forage for items and food in containers, abandoned buildings and even in vending machines.  Food not only staves off hunger, it also provides buffs for battles, and some items cure status effects.\n\nFinding as many of these items as possible is important, because fights can be tough.  Even a stray dog can wipe the floor with you if you're not keeping an eye on your HP.  A bandit can flat out murder you. There are random encounters, so you can be attacked almost anywhere,  but there are also enemies roaming around the map with you. Most of the ones I've seen so far have been bandits and wild dogs, but there are creepier things lurking around.  You can save anywhere except for the middle of battle, so that makes dying a little less aggravating.\n\nI'm not going to do a pro/con list or give a rating, since the game is still being developed.  But I will list a few things I'd like to see as soon as possible (some of which are already planned, according to the early access info on the store page):\n\n-More NPCs. I haven't met anyone yet except for people and creatures that want me dead. Some quests and conversations would be nice.  It's possible that I haven't seen anyone yet because I haven't come across a NPC hangout place yet.\n\n-A more reliable way to heal, or a difficulty setting, or both. A hardcore survival experience where you have to keep an eye on dwindling supplies will appeal to a lot of people.  Others won't want it to be this hard.\n\n-Gamepad support.  Using the keyboard works fine, I just prefer using a gamepad with RPG Maker games.\n\n-More classes, skills, and a bigger map.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun post-apocalypse survival RPG with retro graphics, here it is, and it's awesome.

It is also worth noting that the dev is highly active in the discussion forum and is eager to hear your suggestions, and seems willing to include all the good ones into the final build.\n\nI plan on updating this review as the game progresses towards it's official release.

You explore a destroyed city searching for your family and attempting to survive. You'll meet people here and there with side quests for you to do, found a couple of them and liked the small dialogues and the characters I met.\n\nThere's a ton of loot to use as craft or resell. For the time being I only have 2 crafting recipes and can only craft bandages and such but The crafting system seem elaborated. I liked the fact that the loot is varied and make the world coherent: you find cigarettes, sex magazines, destroyed books, ... I even found a condom! All the objects have an interesting description, sometimes funny, and flesh out the world.\nIn case you're worried about emptying the world (I managed to do it in some games, that's not good at all, believe me) I saw that the enemies and the containers repoped after an hour or so.\n\nThere's also a ton of options that you can modify: fog of war makes your view very small but makes for a better ambiance; Stamina to toggle free run or not; Survival to toggle hunger and thirst, you find a lot of food and realistically the hardest to find is water. You can deactivate everything for a more casual experience or activate everything for a bit of challenge.\n\nThe game is set up as a real RPG with attributes and skills and I really liked the skills system: you have 5 points on each level up to pick your skills and can choose active or passive ones, their cost varying from 1 to 5 points. And there's a ton of skills to choose! The battles are really hard at first so I went for passive ones that raises evade and such, and inflict status effects or riposte. That made the battles really easier: I inflict a ton of deadly effects and the enemies basically kill themselves when they manage to hit me, much fun! Interestingly there's an aggro system: you can equip one of your characters with special equipment and buy him special skills so that he becomes the most targeted person in the group. Or the opposite: modify him to be less targeted.\n\nThe bad: The game is very rough on the edges. The intro is really raw with barely a few lines, then the character creation isn't detailed; you choose one of 4 propositions, twice. Apparently you first choose your appearance, then an attribute bonus. Luckily I chose 'tough' which gave a nice bonus from what I read in the forum (+25% Max HP, +25% Morale.). The stat screen is filled with a lot of abbreviations, making it a bit confusing. Hint: MSV is the radiation level. There's also several different damages, like puncture. But there's nothing bad there in fact, it's only the profusion of it that makes it hard to understand in the beginning.\n\nSo yeah the beginning is very confusing and can leave a bad impression, but if you give it a chance you'll quickly get around it and discover a really enjoyable game. The more I played, the more I got hooked to it and started enjoying it. Went in the loop: have a couple of fights, loot everything and go back to the safe place to trade all that for pills to heal my radiation level, equiping and leveling my character and buying more combat skills. It quickly went into the 'I'll just make one more building', it's hard to stop. And it's the first time that I'm happy to find a rotten fruit in a container to quench my thirst :) Apparently the game is a single guy's work, so I'm rather impressed.\n\nSo yeah I do recommend the game. Give it a chance and you're in for some fun. Be your own caravan guy: kill, loot, sell, craft!\n\n**********************\nI'm not used to leave suggestions in a review but I saw in the forum the dev requesting it, so here goes:\nRemove the FPS and the version onscreen.\nA better intro for a new game: for example a scrolling pixelated image of a devastated city skyline with the text appearing on a black rectangle on the lower part of the screen.\nBetter explanation on character creation about the things you pick.\nA recap of the attributes, like what strenght does etc. It could be put in a help screen callable with F1.\nA bit less radiation when there's a radiation storm: seeing the numbers rise so fast and for so long is very painful to watch ^^\nA toggable option to show where you are on the map - or at the very least clearly say where you are in the beginning of the game, I had to find it out in the forum.\nShow the weight of items in the storage screen\nAn option to store more items at a time in the storage screen, like store all Misc items at once.\nBe able to sort the items in the storage.\nThe last 3 are not really that needed but would it help in the long term.","March 14","true","11.3"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","9","14","3","0"

Well, I present to you Waste Walkers. From scavenging, getting your face torn off by mutated monsters, and dealing with radiation poisoning, Waste Walker's puts you in the middle of post apocalyptic world and lets you figure out the rest. Starting from nothing, you will have to scratch, gnaw, and fight your way to make something of yourself and be able to survive. This will take time and patience, just about everything wants to kill you and can easily do so. Waste Walkers is a game with many elements and features that take time to explore and fully appreciate, such as crafting, passives, techniques, trading, food conservation, and of course making friends. The only thing this game needs is polish and more of everything. Which the developer already has planned. The only issue is that the game can be brutally difficult. You don't have much in the way of weaponry and little pointing you in the direction of finding them. However long as you save often, death shouldn't be an issue. In all if you want to play a fun, unique mash up of RPG and open world post-apocalyptic game.

But what he finds is a world of radiated monstrosities, unforgiving and relentless bandits, curious survivors, and next to nothing to eat or drink. And so the danger filled journey of survival and discovery begins.\n\nAt first glance, you will see the usual mechanics and workings of the old school rpgs, but you will quickly realize that there are a host of different parameters that have to be carefully, and wisely, monitored in order to have success in the game. And that is a huge positive ---- it makes you think carefully about every move you make, every building you enter, every battle you find yourself in, every supply you are offered to pick up and perhaps use, and every choice you make involving other characters you meet along your journey.\nYou have to watch not only your HP, but your stamina, your hunger level, your hydration level, your radiation level, and other factors that will be important to your success or failure.\nFortunately, there are several save slots so the "trial and error" method can be used ---- at least, for me.\nIt is simply a game that will make you think about your very next move all the time rather than just fighting and leveling up to get through. Selecting the proper strategy is paramount ---- and that is a big aspect that makes this game so much fun to play. The challenge is high, but fair ---- with a lot of "Why didn't I think of that before?" moments.\n\nAdditionally, the mechanics and controls of the game are easy to learn, and work flawlessly.\n\nAnd the sound effects, along with spooky music, yield a creepiness factor that is a huge plus to what's going on. You easily get into the atmosphere of the story in no time at all.\n\nThe game is constantly being updated and added to by a dev that obviously cares very much about perfecting the game experience and offering us something different that stands out.\n\nWell, right now I'm stuck in a bank with feral dogs snapping at my heels, so it's back to it for me ---- and I would urge anyone to give this tremendously entertaining and highly polished game a chance.

Other than that, tons of updates. Good stuff.\n\nLAUNCH DATE: Starting the game, no direction, left to wander.  Don't be discouraged because of that (tis a good thing!).\nThis is still early access so there's so much more for this game to become!\n\nCharacter customization (equipment) is varied and I'm extremely excited to try out, like the many skills and techniques they offer.  There's tons of equipment to choose from as you go along: knives, guns, etc.\n\nCombat is standard to what anyone's seen in a classic RPG game.\n\nThere are many many characters you encounter as you explore, and I hope, as I play more, that more information is revealed about everyone, the current situation (in which I will update this review as I go along) because learning about others seems to be going well, even with what little information there might be so far.\n\nMy only gripe(s) would be to have the ability to use multiple quantities of items from the inventory instead of just having to use it one at a time, booting you out of the menu entirely, and repeating yourself. IMPLEMENTED!\n\nAlso, during combat, I feel the background should be way more dimmed/blurred because I find myself confused what I'm looking at. Although, that's just aesthetics, I suppose.\n\nThe developers are incredible and they LISTEN.  Just a few days ago when I got a key for this, I noticed major lag so I posted it in the community hub. Now? Practically nonexistent!  And that was in a span of just a few hours!\n\nYou don't have to trust me, this is just my opinion; I've just been longing to play a game like this again with a few twists like its survival implementation (hunger, thirst). I've only played a tad less than an hour but I've no doubt that this'll be a great experience.\n\n*coughcough*hopetoseemynameinthecreditsfortheartworkdisplayedsomewhere*coughcough* :)","June 1, 2015","true","4.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Anyone who wishes to see what they were, can read the comments.\n\nConcept is good but not enough to warrant a buy if you're not interested in RPGMaker games. They did change a lot, but it's an RPGMaker game. If you like turn based combat and you can overlook the clunky inventory management (which is a problem with any RPGMaker game and JRPG games in general), then this game is a must buy.\n\nAs a side note, the dev is really taking this seriously and he's trying his best.

These days you see a lot of rpgmaker games out there and most of them, lets be honest. Simply suck. Waste Walkers takes from the rpgmaker games and for the love of survival games and blends them together to make an absolutely amazing experience.\n\nI had the pleasure of streaming one of the earlier builds of the game many months ago during one of our charity events and even the viewers wanted to see more of the game. Again that speaks volumes for a rpgmaker game. So it is really best when talking about Waste Walkers from this moment on that we no longer put it in the same category with the other garbage that tends to follow that category.\n\nYou have player choices, you have your classic jrpg style combat, but most importantly you have your scavenging and human resources needed to survive. Food and water. You have your armors, your weapons and your characters. There is a story in this game but you are meant to look for it. As it is basically an open world game. This is a game where you survive and while doing so you level up, progress your character, and find the bleak dark story of this world.\n\nThe price if this game is fantastic and the content is coming as it gets further developed. If you didn't pick this up in the first The Drastik Measure Groupee's bundle then I suggest picking it up now.\n\nThere will be more of a review to publish later but I wanted to get something up now.

Here is my review of this game called Waste Walkers.\n\nThis game is very unique and you start out inside a basement of a house (That might be yours.) and you scavenge for resources that you can use to survive, but before that you can customize your character which is something I find pretty neat!\n\nYour objective is to survive but that's not the only objective..You can choose to help people that need assistance such as getting an item for them.\n\nWhile i have only came across one glitch it is a really great game so far! The bug or glitch i came across is when you go to the police station and you grab the key to the armory..When I grabbed the key and opened the door it still would not let me through..But that did not ruin the experience for me in anyway..I kinda was happy that it happen because then it would make everything way easier.\n\nWhy do I recommend Waste Walkers? Because it is unique and I have yet to see a Survival RPG Maker game on steam..And a game such as this is amazing as it is well done, the developer is new in game designing and needs support. I am willing to lend him my support seeing how he did a great job on this game! Sure I have only had 2 hours in the game..But in those 2 hours, It was a fun experience and I know there might not be much in the game..But i know this game is worth supporting or paying $6.99 for..To be honest i don't think it should be $6.99..But maybe the price will change when it is a full game.\n\nThe next thing I like about the game is the hydration and Food meter..Now you have to eat alot in order to heal yourself..Sometimes I eat food so i can heal but sometimes i eat it when I am low on hunger or hyrdration..Regardless I think the food meter and hydration meter is a cool thing because it adds more survival into it..Oh! And did i mention there is a Radiation meter? Well there is! And if you get near vehicles the meter will go up.\n\nNow..I know this is weird and kinda stupid to like..But how the levels of monsters or bandits in Waste Walkers..What i find cool about it is that when you level up, so do the monsters and bandits..Which is pretty impressive because I know that when you are making maps or layers I know it isn't as easy as you think.\n\nFinally here are my thoughts or ideas on what i think should be put in Waste Walkers and if you are reading this developer I hope you continue to soar high and continue to make unique games. You have my support!\n\nHere are ideas or my thoughts on what should be in the game in the future:\n\nRelationship System/Love System - Even when the world ends, People still find love or fight by each other's side.\n\nPets -You can tame or befriend wild creatures and such.\n\nStoryline - While this may be a game focused on surivival..I would like to see a storyline.\n\nAdoption - In a post-apocalyspe world there are those who no longer have parents..I would love to see a adoption feature so when you saw a child that is outside or whatever by himself/herself then you could choose to adopt him or her.\n\nA Night/day system - While it may be nighttime in Waste Walkers all the time..I would love to see a night time/day time feature as it would be cool and make it more realistic even though it is a RPG Maker game.\n\nSupernatural NPCS or Characters - I would love to see supernatural beings such as Succubus, Demons, or any other mythological supernatural character or beast..But not just any Supernatural Character or beast..But characters that could imply to the relationship system up top..For an example: The character could be walking down the hallway and he or she thought he or she heard someone behind him or herself..But when he or she turn back nothing was there but when he or she looked back the succubus or demons appeared before him or herself.) The relationship/love system would be the same as the other NPCS or characters..But the supernatural characters or mythical creatures could be completely different because of how they talk or act.\n\nA bigger world - Exactly as it is titled..This idea would be that you could do some missions or quests and have them completed in order to acquire the item that can lead you to another city, town, area, or world.\n\nHouse/Fort System - I would love to see this in this type of game because you could litterally be at home but you can get raided and such..Which I think would be pretty cool!\n\nFamily system - I think it would be cool to see this espically if you had the house/fort system since you could have certain characters control or maintain certain things.\n\n\nAnd that is all for my review! I hope this helped anyone who was heistate to buy this game!\n\nEDIT: Also when I say that it shouldn't be $6.99 I did not mean that in a bad way. It should be higher then $6.99 but that is just my opinion.\n\nUpdate 1: The game now has a story which is of course in-progress and the base building is expanding more as updates are giving to this game, However the developer has become stingy lately. I recommend this game for those who are looking for a great game rather then looking for a developer. I don't recommend this game if you are looking for the developer..He does give great support and advice but also he can change in personality as he did yell at me once and went off topic one time.","September 6, 2015","true","9.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","6","11","2","6"

Additionaly the developer is actively pursuing ideas and feedback to implement and improve the experience.\n\nAs for the actual game you will find a different concept (survival after the apocalypse) in a familiar shell (rpg turn-based) with some wrinkles and new material that accentuate the experience. The emphasis on survival over pure combat/grindcore style was the reason I decided to give it a shot. I have not been disappointed.\n\nI will give a full review once the game is finished but I have no problem giving it the thumbs up and go ahead as it stands today.\n","October 10, 2015","true","8.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Death in waste walkers hits hard and fast making for a game where you are always on the edge of your seat fearing for what might come next. This is an awesome game I say pick it up.","August 21, 2015","true","1.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Super simple, fun, complex, just the way i like games.\n\nGuys (and gals) when you first start off, loot everything in the house then go back to the basement. sleep in the bed, then leave the houes. outside the house, go south-west and loot the shed. After that, go to your right and into the building across the street (its a library) there is medical supplies, and a quest on the second floor. WARNING!!!!!

Well worth the low price.  I wouldn't mind seeing more of the world you champs are building.  It would also be good for immersion for gear to have an effect on appearance, even if it's a small one.  Class-specific skills (for NPCs, as I'm fairly sure the PC will never actually have a class) would also be a plus.  From what I can tell though, these have probably all been thought of already and are likely in the works.\n\nFor potential buyers: if you want to see a JRPG done right, and with a healthy dose of post-apocalyptic goodness, give it a shot.  Well worth your time.  As was stated by the devs, this isn't your typical RPG Maker game.  I was skeptical at first, but they've held themselves to that statement very well.","September 12, 2015","true","19.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

You will be bitten,stung,chopped,bashed,poisoned,iradiated and much more on your journey through the wastes!. You wil encounter insects,ghouls,bandits feral dogs and more that are not a push over so you better avoid them untill you are well prepared and equiped and even then beware it is about survival not combat so be warned ! ;p\n\nIf you are a Fallout fan then you are going to love Waste Walkers in the way that takes ths style of game back to it's roots, even if you have never played Fallout and are not familiar with the franchise you will love Waste Walkers ,it is a fresh take  on the relentless world of nuclear apocalypse with all of the worlds end wonder we have come to know and love!.\n\nIt is very fluid to play especially if you are familiar with pokemon style rpg which is how the gameplay and control system are similar too except you will die a lot.... oh yes you will die many times whilst you learn to play due to the fact it really is a survival game unlike many that claim to be this will make you work hard to truely survive.\nThe loot systme is epic many many buildings etc to loot all with randomly generated loot tables, a very good rpg level up system and char creation with skills and techiques some of which are passive, a great crafting system with schematics to craft various items ,weapons,armour meds etc also there is a hunger and thirst mechanic of which you will need to find food and drink on your travels through the wastes.There is also a geiger counter which sounds when you are being iradiated, i have only played 4.9  hours so far so there is much more i have not discovered as well as new content to come.\n\nAll in all it is an exellent title showing what a solo independent developer can acheive ,he is also keen to take on board suggestions and communicates with the community very well indeed and at 19 years old has put many other indy early access dev teams to shame, i wish Corrosion well and hope he goes on to be very sucessful ,the game industry thrives on people like this that go on to be what makes gaming epic!.\n\nI rate this 10/10 on all aspects of the game and is a must have in your library and is well worth the £4.99 price tag that has 25% off at the moment to celerate Corrosive's 1 year aniversary on the 20th september 2015!.","September 16, 2015","true","7.0"," 17 of 34 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","17","34","3","7"

These are the words that describe Waste Walkers.\n\nCombat is mostly meant to be avoided, as these enemies are not mass production mooks.  Each and every enemy has their own perks and abilities, but most importantly, they are fighting to survive, just like you are. Carefully avoiding enemies while you loot containers is a sensible idea, and completeing quests is more effective for gaining exp. Enemies do currently scale with the player and his comrades, but this never feels overly annoying.\n\nCrafting is simple, as are most quests. Simple does not mean easy, as many of these items are in the hands of dangerous individuals or randomly generated. The rewards are subtle, but they will benefit you either in spare cash and exp, or in better services and cheaper supplies. They can even gain you access to powerful and vital supplies. Crafting can help make your life cheaper and easier, once you buy the scematics. Crafting may be limited to what you can make, but they can save you much time, effort and resources if you are determined enough.\n\nIt is not to say there are no flaws, but that is mostly due to resource limitations. WW is a large game for an opening title, and is still rather fun.\n\nOverall, Waste Walkers is a survivors fight for his life, and an enjoyable experience for those who likewasteland exploration games.","September 28, 2015","true","37.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","1"

I didn't get it for free. Etc. Don't be a taffy puller.\nFan.friggin.tastic.\nLook, there's tons upon tons of BS RPGmaker games on Steam, if you have more than 300 games and you haven't run into any of them, then you haven't been paying very close attention. This actually uses the mechanics of the game generator well and takes them further, in an unexpected way.\n\nThis game is friggin' hard...\n\nThere's no other way to put that. This is a very difficult game, and when it tells you to avoid combat, you should probably take its advice. It's not so difficult it's unplayable like some "SUPER HARD OMG" games out there, but it's just hard enough to be frustrating at times.\n\nThere are SLSK references.\n\nI've used SLSK for years - nice shout outs, and they're everywhere. A+\n\nVisuals, music, etc\n\nThe visuals are what you would expect from an RPGmaker game, but they are stylized and well used in this context. This is an idea that's been done a million times, BUT it's done in a unique way and made entirely the developer's own. The music is appropriate, but it doesn't blow me away. I was well entertained by everything used in the game, even the Game Over screen, which I've seen a few times because I keep walking into enemies like a ♥♥♥♥♥ when I forget that combat should be avoided. Oops.\n\nQuest system:\n\nThis is the strongest quest system I've seen in an RPGmaker game - really, really good! I would just like to put this in large letters: WOULD ALL OF THE RPGMAKER DEVELOPERS OUT THERE PLEASE TAKE NOTE OF WHAT THIS ONE HAS DONE, AND FLAT OUT PLAGIARIZE IT SO YOUR GAMES WILL BE PLAYABLE? Brilliant.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis is not a good "RPG Maker" game - it's a good game. Period. It's not "good for an RPGMaker title" - it's just good. Well worth the 10 bucks, and I'm almost positive I picked it up in a bundle somewhere along the line.

Intense and atmospheric gameplay, yes, this IS A COMBAT GAME. Ok I plyed it for 1.5 hours but did quite a bit of gameplay mechanics. Like the idea of minimal keys required. The crafting is simple but enough to hold interest. Some items rarity, to me , seems a bit off like lined paper. Has everyone taken ALL lined paper with them.. they all writting a post apocolyptical memoir?. Scavenging is fun. Searching here and there. Running hiding, combat, running, hiding combat... rinse repeat. Vast area to explore and enough environmental issues to keep you on your toes. Game mechanics are good and not over complicated. Simplified healing, Hunger, Hydration... etc. Regular inventory system which you can expand through crafting.\n\nOne of the ideas I liked was the fact that you did not find a treasure trove in every house/ building. This made searching even more a necessity. I would recommend using more stealth and care when exploring due to various dangers..like DO NOT STEP IN WATER.. just a note for you.\n\nOne idea that annoyed me was that more often than not I had to enter a combat situation. Combat mechanic is menu driven. Fight/Flight (which I only could do once in 10 fights)/ Techniques. These are the three menu options. Simple enough. What has put me off is that I tended to hit enemies 1 out of 3 attacks and them 2 out of 3. Another issue, which I hope the devs will look at, is the level 1 Blaster Bandits. Every hit I did on them they suffered 1 point of damage and resisted the rest, every hit, they hit back with 35 on average per hit on me. I was level 3.\n\nNow even though I tried to run away, be stealthy, I entered combat more times than I would have liked. I originaly got this game because it was listed as 'not a combat game' but I understood that there would be combat. A LOT of combat. Combat I did NOT go looking for. So I died more than was enjoyable. Just because I did not enjoy the game does not mean others won't either.\n\nDevs, they got a winner here. I will watch its developement but do not think it is for me, too much combat. 8/10","October 4, 2015","true","1.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Its cheap, fun, and quick. Of course this game is in RPG maker so it does have its limits but the game has great potenital and its showing it every week. The developer is quick on fixing bugs and adding more quests,buildings,weapons, and small changes.

Storyline has been made into the game and the story itself is compeling enough for me to follow it.\n\nPros\nCheap\nQuick\nFocus on more survival than combat\nUnique looting system\nDiverse quests you can do and buildings you can enter\nHas an open world feel\nBig map\nOffers diverse class type\nCons\nGame can be repetitve\nEncounter system can be wonky and you could be stuck between 2 people you dont want to fight\nThe game might not be combat driven but most of the passives and skills are combat driven  Now mostly fixed.\nSince the game is made RPG maker the game itself can be very limiting\nAll in all the game is good and promising and Dev shows good manners but the game needs some revising and more skills focused on other things rather than combat.\n\nSo go get it a good game for small price of 10 dollars.","October 11, 2015","true","33.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

The game itself is set after the bombs that have landed, and brings a unique vision on the "Post apocolitic wasteland".\n\nThere's a few things I would quickly like to mention; even tho this had the concept of fallout written on it, it is still a completely different game wish much hours of enjoyment to be had, there's seveal mechanics that RPG players will appreuate.\n\nMechanics; Level based Stats, Learn able skills, Compaions, Crafting, Looting, bartering, turn based battling, character customisation and a large amount of quests.\n\nEach of these could be a lenghty explenation why I personally like them, but i'll keep it short but sweet.\n\nLevel based stats;  This is good especially for this game as it does get progressivly hard the more you level up, and the stats actually count for something (they are explained at the beginning of the game)\n\nLearnable skills;  This gives the feel of acomplishment when you finally do learn a useful new skill, these can honestly be the diference between life and death.\n\nCompanions; We all love having some sort of assistance with people aiding us when we need it, but this also helps with the inventory system to.\n\nCrafting: You're able to craft few items but this can obviously be improved.\n\nLooting: This is basically a way of life within the game loot->sell->use->repeat.\n\nBartering/traiding; this allows to keep yourself stocked up in weapons/armour and stuff to survive the harsh wold waste walkers is set in.\n\nturn based battling; a very nostaligic thing for me as I love turn based games, it brings a aspect from years ago that is lost amoung current games...unfortunetly this will still be a thing in the past.\n\ncharacter customisation:  Theres not much in this aspect but you can chose your; name, stats, skills and cosmetic skin.\n\nI would happily rate this game 9/10 for the fact it bring a lot of nostaligia to it, would recommend getting this game!\n\nAlso been talking to the dev a little; Some interesting stuff coming soon.\nDid i forget it has "hardcore mode"?

Now, I won’t beat around the bush; this is one of the most expansive and intricate games built on this engine, and it’s sure to steal more than a few hours of your time.\n\nThe story is fairly standard for a post-apocalyptic setting: The world has been destroyed by nuclear war and mundane life no longer exists. Normal people who lead normal lives must struggle to survive against the war’s aftermath. You’re put in the shoes of a survivor, separated from his/her family. Vague leads and shady individuals are your only guides, and you’ll take whatever you can get to find them.\n\nAs stated previously, this is a big game with a lot of stuff crammed inside. The map is littered in side quests, NPCs, monsters, and all sorts of things to explore. Just about every structure has an interior ripe with loot, and believe me, there is a lot of stuff to loot. In fact, a lot of your time will be spent away from the main quest line; mastering the maddness in this shell of a city.\n\nBefore going any further, there’s something that should be made clear. This game does not hold your hand. Apart from a short tutorial explaining some basic mechanics, you’re on your own. A lot is left for the player to figure out, and if you’re the type of guy who needs a big, shiny objective marker leading the way, you might want to give Waste Walkers a pass.\n\nYou’ve got your typical array of survival mechanics, such as a hydration and hunger bar, topped off with a radiation meter; however, food and water is in large abundance, so keeping healthy is not much of a challenge. What really makes this game difficult is combat, especially in the earlier stages. You start out weak and pathetic. Maintaining ammunition is a challenge at first, and trading punches with every beast crossing your path is NOT a good idea.\n\nWaste Walkers is a game that encourages patience, and with a variety of different survivors to recruit, armor to find and weapons to wield, it won’t be long before you’re ready for a fight…. In fact, maybe you’re a little too ready; after you’ve leveled up and found some decent loot, Waste Walkers challenge goes down the drain. Just about anything will die within a few hits, and the tension slowly dissolves little by little.\n\nLike I said, the game offers little hand holding. I started up Waste Walkers with the wrong frame of mind. I spent a few hours running around aimlessly, getting lost and dying over and over and over. I got so frustrated that I was tempted to quit altogether. To properly enjoy this game, you’ve really gotta know what you’re getting into. Take things slow and try to familiarize yourself with the map, the enemies, the loot, the world as a whole. But trust me; Waste Walkers can get addictive once you know what you’re doing.\n\nI can only recommend this game to those who are well acquainted with the genre, or to those who want to be. But if you’re willing to take the risk, you’ll be in for one hell of a ride.","December 23, 2015","true","11.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grimswolf/recommended/371100/","grimswolf","Grimswolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grimswolf/","227 products in account","A surprisingly well excuted use of the RPG Maker engine to produce something more than the usual fare. Mechanics are about as would be predicted for the engine and genre, extended to include welcome survial elements (which I believe can be turned off? Wasn't intrested in doing so myself but do recall seeing that).\n\nThe setting might be said to be like Fallout, but unlike Fallout which takes place many decades after an apocolyptic event, Waste Walkers places you in the role of a survivor shortly after whatever happened (it seems to be one of the mysteries of the game) happened. Resources are scarce and heavy enough to make you concerned and wish to create stashes around the city, but not so far as to panic. Combat is very challenging but not impossible, and the survival element is reinforced by some encounters consistantly costing more resources than they reward, making 'fight or flight?' an important question throughout the game.\n\nThe two things I felt could have contained more content was the novel and guide found in the Pepper's edition. However those are accurately presented as non essetial content that in no way impacts the game (much like a sound track dlc, they're just additional files of interest to some and not game content) so it's a minor grief of mine.\n\nAll around though if you were looking for a lower end post apocolyptic survival game and/or an example of the RPG Maker engine being pushed to produce something different than the stereotypical content people have come to expect, Waste Walkers is worth a shot. Kinda looking forward to the author's next project as well.\n\nAdded 4-10-2016\n\nBeen trying to post a review for the new DLC through the usual method, on the DLC page, but Steam doesn't seem to want to let me so... figure I'll try adding it to the end of this. So this is for the Deliverance DLC\n\nKey for DLC provided by the developer for reviewing purposes, which was really nice of him. Thanks to Corrosion!\n\nDeliverance plays as a separate game from standard Waste Walkers using the same engine. When you load Waste Walkers a Steam dialog pops up to ask you which of the two games you wish to play. I'm a bit torn as to if Deliverance would have been better posted as a separate game (perhaps billed as a sequel), rather than as a DLC to Waste Walkers, but I can definitely say that your experience in the base Waste Walkers game is not effected by having Deliverance or not.\n\nRather than creating your own custom character as in Waste Walkers you start as the character Screw, with a few stat points and skills already taken as well as his own backstory. The skill system is the same as Waste Walkers though, so you'll quickly be setting up your own style of character anyway within a couple of levels.\n\nCombat is much more difficult than in Waste Walkers in a good way, early on guns beyond the pipe weapons that fire improvised ammo made with nails are nearly impossible to find even in the shops prior to completing a certain story mission.\n\nAfter a few plays I was finding tabs (the currency of the Waste Walkers world, similar to caps from Fallout) were easy to come by in standard Waste Walkers, while in Deliverance I was doing more to manage them so that I could afford what limited armor and weapons was available for purchase. There's also a great deal more crafting going on in Deliverance, with almost all of the vendors offering a few schematics for sale to make items of varying usefulness. First aid kids, survival kits and med packs were probably the items I found the most useful to craft, allowing me to carry a few more effective items rather than a larger number of minor supplies.\n\nDeliverance has quite a bit more writing and character than Waste Walkers, and while it could still use some polish (odd moments such as a character walking wounded into a room she was expected to be found in, rather than being found wounded in the room could have been staged to make a touch more sense) it shows a major step up from the previous entry. NPCs are a bit more fleshed out and human in their interactions, and events flow together in a cohesive manner. There's quite a few more quests as well, though perhaps a few of those from NPCs at the base area could have been spread out by delaying them until later in the story. Felt as though a glut of them were presented at the outset, then as I progressed through the main story there weren't as many minor side quests to pursue.\n\nSo overall a good amount of fun, and if I were to pick one thing I'd like to have seen differently it'd be having Deliverance as a separate game from Waste Walkers. The difference in overall quality and enjoyment is significant enough that it almost feels awkward having it as a DLC.","February 17","true","30.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

For the amount of time that i have played this game, i have enjoyed the artwork, and the map that goes with it. Wish i had more time to play this game though.\n\nThough confusing at first, the map get easier to remember the more you run around it. I know that when i first started the game, it just put me in there with a few instructions on how things work. Besides that, it reminds me of those old retro games where difficulty isn't a choice, it's how you progress. For instance, in legend of zelda, you gain more items and hearts that enhances your power. In this game, you level up, find items, and use tactics to get through it.\n\nControls arent bad, responsive enough where you aren't running into things you don't mean to, and quick enough to get out of a house full of bandits. if there was one thing i would change about the controls, it would be a different button for back, or an option to change controls. The ESC button is a bit out of the way for a B button. The first few times i started out, i changed some settings only to hit that return to menu button at the end of the options. That doesn't return me to my ingame menu, it sends me to the title screen. I can't help it to push it, such a compelling button that is full of hopes and promisses, begging me to click it in hopes of being returned to the inventory menu.","December 3, 2015","true","0.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

It's finally here - Waste Walker. And let me tell you: it is 101% worth your money(10€), trust me :)\n\nIn a nutshell, Waste Walkers is a post-apocalyptic RPG - based on the RPG-Maker - with a lot of refinment to it.\n\nGameplayGameplay of Waste Walker is fun:\n\nThe games main focus is not combat - and especially fighting for yourself - but staying alive.\nYou walk around, find more party members, manage consumption, complete quest and propgress through the story.\nThe game is difficult, I like it. I will admit that I've died many times in the game, that's ok. When I died, in the game, I took it as a very important lesson. When I returned to that area that I previously died in, I knew how to tackle my past mistake.\nCombat of Waste Walkers is turned-based, half random-encounters half in-field enemies.\n\ngraphics\nGraphics in Waste Walkers is 16-bit sprite-based with a post-apocalyptic twist to it.\nI like  the games evirement, atmosphere and feel to it. But, at times, the immersion breaks when I see suits of armour, swords and other medievel-fantasy things that doesn't belong.\nOther than that, I don't know what to say about the graphics.\n\nStoryYou may have noticed that I've been talking about Waste Walkers gameplay, refinment and envirement and not much about the story. well... that is because, I haven't gotten that far in to the story. Reason why I haven't progressed that far in the game is because it's easy to get lost in the game - there is a map but it's not really that helpful.\n\nStory of Waste Walkers starts of with a prologue-text. In a nutshell, the text recaps how war has destroyed earth as we know it and now it's filled with mutated monsters, gangs, thugs and many other terrible things. But! ''There is HOPE''.\n\nConclusionWaste Walker is one of those RPGMaker games that will always stand out in my mind due to it being a post-apocalyptic-RPG, and not just another medieval-RPG like most RPG-maker games are.\n\nPros and Cons:\n\nPro:\n-not that many many bugs.\n-Difficult.\n-a lot of content.\n-you are not forced to use a gamepad.\n-...And last, but not least, one of my favourite features on Waste Walkers is: a mouse cursor.  My gamepad has been acting very strange lately. So I was very glad that Waste Walkers didn't force me to use a Gamepad like almost every RPGmaker game out there.\n\nCon:\n-Medievel-fantasy-icons and armour - at times - breaks the immersion.\n\nKeep up the good work, Corrosion :)","December 29, 2015","true","14.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zer0ite/recommended/371100/","Zer0ite","Zer0ite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zer0ite/","43 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo this being my first review on Steam, I would like to address that my review for beginning it all may be a little on the bigger side of reviews so I do apologize sincerely if someone was looking for a quick summary of the game and if they wanted to purchase it or not. I may include a brief review at the very end of my ramblings so for those of you looking for a quick and easy nudge in the proper direction you can easily see what I was discussing.\n\n\nAnyways, I shall not digress any further; to begin the mechanics I stumbled across in this game captivated me to a extent of what was there to work with. With the game still currently in beta I can understand there are elements still needing to be refined and with the short playtime I have on record thus far which at the time of the review is only about four hours at most. I find a appealing factor in Waste Walkers, one of which is brought upon the enjoyments I find out of other games such as Fallout which no doubt is the game's premise centered around. The system has a while to go until it is fully layered to the point where replayability can be found. Some of the quests (Such as one involving a couple in the department store) could do with more plot development other than a guilt tripped woman going about her life in a monotonous pattern. You could argue that these strangers bare no important role in the big picture and that I would agree upon; however with quests that are straight forward. Quests that seem to be daunting with simplistic tasks and not having a overall drive of actuality behind them (Remember only four hours in) I could find how some would become very bored with the game rapidly.\n\n\nHowever, I have given the game a shot and I believe in my own opinion it has aspects of which are desired. Aspects of which to grow and expand, lessons to step forward with and to become its own community of wastelanders. I truly believe that for a start up beta, what is offered currently is enough to drive itself further and further. IF Corrosive Studios is capable of pushing their work of art in the proper direction and building a game not just merely a clone of what Fallout is, but a unique blend of what a survival rpg is. Bringing in their own sense to the terminology of what it means to be throw to the barrens of the wastes and how you must survive in a dog eat dog world. For this genre is riddled with video games that just don't chalk up to what they desire to be and with the first steps Waste Walkers has taken and the aspects of its survival, the managment of resources, the exploration of a expanding world and the ability to not only live a story through a character but to write your own story in it of itself is appealing to be in the helm of. There could be more strategy involved, not only in the combat but in the tactics a player decides to do; how to achieve a goal and what the player is destined to do to obtain said goal in their own terms which would make it more survivalist in the end.\n\n\nThis game will only go as far as the developers wish to take it, and if a community were to form around it then I would happily become engrossed with it. I hope the review I left to whomever may read it gave you a tidbit of what Waste Walkers has to offer and as of writing it I may have been critical and focused on a topic of questing systems but for a game to jump into I believe it is worth a shot.\n\n\n\n\n-Brief Summary-\nSurvival elements are surely there\nThe explorational factor of a world to see it in ruin and how truly desolate it can get when you venture forward\nThe combat system is nicely balanced. It isn't a main focus which I like however I think there should be more strategy\nQuestline so far with how long I have played of merely four hours; could do more with introducing the world around us\nResource managment isn't a big issue but scavaging gives its own appeal, darting from building to building and hoping it isn't filled with raiders already or gore flies..\nThe skills offered to be obtained seem to be fairly well rounded, assisting as needed\n\n\n-Shorter summary of what I think-\nIts a good game, a game of which has a ways to go but as a beta it is enjoyable and worth my time to experience the world of which is; Waste Walkers.","September 20, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This game is pure survival where you at first have to literally scrap around for supplies, avoid combat and radiation/other hazards all while staying alive and surviving. Going through the game you progress and start getting better weapons like guns, different rifles, shotguns, assault rifles, or even a bow if you're into that. It is a decently sized map that has a-lot of content to go through, certain people give quests and you can also raise your own colony after comepleting a certain quest line. You have your own party which can be expanded after you get a colony. There's alot of features in this game and alot to do, I recommend trying it out if you're into just pure survival. Has a great looting system  where you scrounge around looking for supplies in abandoned houses (not every building in this game is going to be empty, some are filled with creatures or gangs of bandits) The combat system is a turned based strategy that does really well for itself, enemies can inflict many different things on you and if you raise your skills up you'll be able to inflict stuns, bleeding, etc on them too. (Ofcourse avoiding combat at the start considering all you have is a knife is a good idea, bandits usually have rifles and shotguns, and deadlier melee weapons)\n\nOverall this game is a once in a while gem that is definetly worth a go if you're into survival in an mmo like game.\n:)","December 12, 2015","true","19.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NCRZombie/recommended/371100/","NCRZombie","!_Zombie_!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NCRZombie/","523 products in account","Right off the bat Waste Walkers captured my attention with a rather different approach to an RPG game than I've been used to lately. Whereas most stories start off by telling you that you have to go here or there to progress — WW did not. Waste walkers spins it's tale through the derelict buildings throughout the Ashen City, and playing with the Fog of War on gives off an eerie Silent Hill vibe.\n\nThe first few hours of the game are a breath of fresh air in comparison to what you'll encounter in the usual gamut of RPGs. You have a journal, a map, and some quest text. That's all you'll get for the rest of the game, and it's also part of the charm of figuring out what you have to do next. Careful planning and ammo conservation are key in the early game, and you run the risk of dying very often early on if you're not paying attention to your surroundings.\n\nEnvironment and music are something the game pulls off well. Each area has a careful attention to detail, and the 30+ buildings that I've explored all have a unique touch to them. From the Cinema to the Police Station — all of them have a special look and feel different from the other areas. Where the story itself is scarce the environment picks up the pace with minimalist storytelling done through the range of NPCs and monsters that roam the Ashen City.\n\nCombat is rather barebones once you really get down into the nit and gritty, but I have to say that it didn't really detract from the game in any way. Managing supplies/needs, health, and inventory doesn't feel like a chore. After a while you'll be able to tell what's worth taking, and what's worth leaving behind amidst your limited inventory space. The base mechanics of the game just work. They don't need the extra flair of 40 skills and abilities that all do the same thing. Maybe a little more push towards using debuffs, or forcing weapon proficiency skills on the player would give choosing a weapon type a weightier decision, but it's a minor gripe if anything.\n\nThe only real complaint I would have is that late-game scaling gets a little weird, and it's entirely possible to trivialize the combat if you've managed your resources properly. Better enemy scaling would provide a more clean transition into the late game, but it hasn't hindered my ability to enjoy the game.\n\n8 hours in at the time of reviewing, and I'm still having a lot of fun with it. As of late I've been drawn to RPGMaker games due to growing tired of games giving me a story in hour long exposition with a cutscene. Waste Walkers is a gem for me, and I can see myself enjoying it for quite a bit longer. Give it a try. The developer certainly seems to have put a lot of love into the game and it shows.\n\nBest of wishes to Corrosion and his future endeavors. I look forward to seeing what you do next.","December 20, 2015","true","10.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Gameplay, and Replayability is what drives this particular title, and the developer has added a few things which make this title different.\n\nThe world where you wake up in is post apocalyptic dangerous wasteland where you will meet up with Ghouls, Raiders, and all kinds of nasties as you try to figure out where you have to go if you follow the story line.\n\nAs in all other JRPG's combat is turn based which is what I am use too, and enjoy. Here is a small list of things that make this title stand out.\n\n#1: Starting Out: (You start by creating your character, and there are a few types to choose from, and make sure you choose, and apply your stats wisely. It can make all the difference in this world believe me.)\n\n#2: Loot type & Loot location are Randomized: (Whenever you start a new game expect the loot to change it's location, and no two locations will hold the same type of loot either. This adds a whole lot of replayability.)\n\n#3: Food/Water/Rads: (You now have to worry about Food, Water, and Radiation on top of everything else, so stock up well, and I suggest that you store allot of your life saving loot throughout the map as safe zones. I have learned the hard way here.)\n\n#4: Crafting: (You will have plenty of opportunity to collect blueprints/crafting abilities which has really added another great feature too this game, once more a beautifully done bit for replayability.)\n\n#5: Survival: (There is more than one way to play this game. You can concentrate on your skills, and weaponry, and take the world on, or stay quite, sneak about, or do both depending on how you skill up, and arm your character. There are a few ways to play this game, and again it's all about survival in this world.)\n\n... The list is pretty large actually.\n\nI have played several JRPG's in the past, and I can honestly tell you that this game has many great things going for it, and add in the replayability value, you will be playing this game a few times just to see how other characters handle being on the outside.\n\nMy Overall Score: 8.5 out of 10\n\n-=FINAL=-\n\nDo I recommend the game?\n\nYes I do without a shadow of a doubt. Believe me, if you are a JRPG/RPGMaker fan like myself, get it, you won't regret it one little bit.","December 9, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","5"

But I feel it's lacking an initial gripping story. Something that says "i'm going to reach the end of this game because it's worth it."\n\nYou start in an 'old house', with a weapon that you choose during character creation, as you gather supplies and run out of nearby places to scavange you have to broaden your search for more supplies, often you will come across enemy NPC's, such as ghouls and bandits.\n\nThe combat I feel lacks luster, while it has fairly impressive customisation of your skills I find myself investing in passive skills - 10% more dodge etc. which leads to tedious repetition of clicking attack - enemy. (Due to having no skills, only passives)\n\nOn the lucky occasion that you may find a safe haven, or friendly NPC 'town' you often get the opportunity to recruit someone to your cause, which as far as I can tell play the same as the player character, they follow and they fight.\n\nThere is a genuine survival element in the fact that you have to eat, drink, and to restore health - sleep.\n\nI know the Dev has put a lot of hard work and many hours into this project and I appreciate how far it has come.\nIt's worth noting the game is still in Early Access and there's still an opportunity to change certain things before release.\n\nI would recommend this game to people who are more interested in a retro rpg style game.\nTo anyone who ownes RPG maker games, you know what to expect.","October 2, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NCRZombie/recommended/371100/","NCRZombie","!_Zombie_!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NCRZombie/","523 products in account","Right off the bat Waste Walkers captured my attention with a rather different approach to an RPG game than I've been used to lately. Whereas most stories start off by telling you that you have to go here or there to progress — WW did not. Waste walkers spins it's tale through the derelict buildings throughout the Ashen City, and playing with the Fog of War on gives off an eerie Silent Hill vibe.\n\nThe first few hours of the game are a breath of fresh air in comparison to what you'll encounter in the usual gamut of RPGs. You have a journal, a map, and some quest text. That's all you'll get for the rest of the game, and it's also part of the charm of figuring out what you have to do next. Careful planning and ammo conservation are key in the early game, and you run the risk of dying very often early on if you're not paying attention to your surroundings.\n\nEnvironment and music are something the game pulls off well. Each area has a careful attention to detail, and the 30+ buildings that I've explored all have a unique touch to them. From the Cinema to the Police Station — all of them have a special look and feel different from the other areas. Where the story itself is scarce the environment picks up the pace with minimalist storytelling done through the range of NPCs and monsters that roam the Ashen City.\n\nCombat is rather barebones once you really get down into the nit and gritty, but I have to say that it didn't really detract from the game in any way. Managing supplies/needs, health, and inventory doesn't feel like a chore. After a while you'll be able to tell what's worth taking, and what's worth leaving behind amidst your limited inventory space. The base mechanics of the game just work. They don't need the extra flair of 40 skills and abilities that all do the same thing. Maybe a little more push towards using debuffs, or forcing weapon proficiency skills on the player would give choosing a weapon type a weightier decision, but it's a minor gripe if anything.\n\nThe only real complaint I would have is that late-game scaling gets a little weird, and it's entirely possible to trivialize the combat if you've managed your resources properly. Better enemy scaling would provide a more clean transition into the late game, but it hasn't hindered my ability to enjoy the game.\n\n8 hours in at the time of reviewing, and I'm still having a lot of fun with it. As of late I've been drawn to RPGMaker games due to growing tired of games giving me a story in hour long exposition with a cutscene. Waste Walkers is a gem for me, and I can see myself enjoying it for quite a bit longer. Give it a try. The developer certainly seems to have put a lot of love into the game and it shows.\n\nBest of wishes to Corrosion and his future endeavors. I look forward to seeing what you do next.","December 20, 2015","true","10.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

This game is pure survival where you at first have to literally scrap around for supplies, avoid combat and radiation/other hazards all while staying alive and surviving. Going through the game you progress and start getting better weapons like guns, different rifles, shotguns, assault rifles, or even a bow if you're into that. It is a decently sized map that has a-lot of content to go through, certain people give quests and you can also raise your own colony after comepleting a certain quest line. You have your own party which can be expanded after you get a colony. There's alot of features in this game and alot to do, I recommend trying it out if you're into just pure survival. Has a great looting system  where you scrounge around looking for supplies in abandoned houses (not every building in this game is going to be empty, some are filled with creatures or gangs of bandits) The combat system is a turned based strategy that does really well for itself, enemies can inflict many different things on you and if you raise your skills up you'll be able to inflict stuns, bleeding, etc on them too. (Ofcourse avoiding combat at the start considering all you have is a knife is a good idea, bandits usually have rifles and shotguns, and deadlier melee weapons)\n\nOverall this game is a once in a while gem that is definetly worth a go if you're into survival in an mmo like game.\n:)","December 12, 2015","true","19.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

It is games like this that make me even bother considering any RPGMaker game. I’m a sucker for the post-apocalyptic genre, and Waste Walkers “did it” for me, but there was more to it than that.\n\nI’m fairly picky with my gaming time. I have so many games in my backlog that if a game doesn’t grip me, I don’t play it longer than an hour. A very large percentage of games I buy don’t even make it past 30 minutes. A game doesn’t have to grip tight, but it does have to keep my interest enough so that I will progress through the story. Waste Walkers managed to keep my interest long enough that by the time I felt like I was done I was close enough to the end that I went ahead and finished it.\n\nThere are definitely some issues in the game, and other reviews already go into those in detail so no need to rehash. Some of the complaints have even been addressed. One of the big issues for me was that I had was some suspension of disbelief issues for quests and getting around on the map.\n\nThe main character is supposed to be from the town where the story takes place. My character should know where specific buildings are, at least places of business, the police station, etc. The character should also know where they are on the map in relation to the building they are next to. So a pip on the map would be really useful and even "realistic" since the character has been living in that city.\n\nAn objective pointer might not make sense for every quest, but maybe the map could have labels on at least some of the major buildings, or if you are tracking a quest and the quest has you go to a public building (like the bus depot, fire station, police station, etc.) then there should be an indicator for the direction to the building with relation to your current position. Since the quest givers are in “known” locations, it would also be nice to have a quest pointer back to the quest giver’s building, too. The player pip and pointers are to help simulate character knowledge that the player doesn't have, and there may be some other way to do this.\n\nLuckily, there is a game guide that provides a map of the city with building names on it, so most of this particular problem only bugged me until I discovered that map. After that when a quest casually mentioned a building, I would scan the map for that building, and head over that way. It would just be a bit more convenient and "more realistic" if an objective pointer would do that for me, and certainly help me find things more easily if I knew where I was in the town by displaying a pip on the map.\n\nSo, really, I don't have much to criticize on the game. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of this style of game.","March 26","true","16.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

If I had to compare it with something, I'd say it's sort of a Project Zomboid for younger kids. The ambiance is good, being primarily sustained by a good soundtrack and a clever "fog of sight" that obscures everything past a certain radius. Unfortunately, the game still lets you see through walls and other objects, which diminishes the creep effect achieved by the fog of sight. The data screen interface could use some tweaking to reduce the number of  clicks needed to do things, but it's fairly clean and intuitive. I'm not particularly fond of how zombies basically look like angry babies in diapers, but I still run away from them when I see them. Then again, I run away from real babies in diapers. The most surprising thing, for such an early release, is that it seems stable and I haven't hit a bug so far. So if you're into early access games, with all the risks that entails, and you don't mind RPG Maker games or yet another zombie game, this one seems to be on the right track.","June 2, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","4"

Thanks dude!\n\nI have only played the game for 25 minutes (as of this review) and I already have positive things to say about it. It is indeed an open world game and lots to explore.\n\nBeing a post apocalyptic survival game with hunger and hydration mechanics it is very important to scavenge for water, and food. ALSO LOOK OUT FOR RADIATION! Too much radiation WILL kill your character. You will also want to hunt for and stock up on medical supplies. It is not a combat centered game but I imagine some encounters will be unavoidable and the combat is hard. I went against advice and went after every enemy could find which eventually lead to my demise and haven't gotten to save once.\n\nThis basically Fallout in 2D and survival combined only with no hardcore option which I totally would of enabled. As much as a I suck at video games in general I am a sucker for that option,\n\nThe only thing I don't like is how you cant just save anywhere or anytime you like. If you have to leave or the power goes out suddenly or you died and haven't saved in a long while this could result in a loss of a lot of progress which could cause people to ragequit the game and never look at it again at least not for a good while.

Also the controls for navigating menues are very annoying. Some of the monsters like the feral dog for example look odd, their is a bit of white outline around it kinda looks like it was cut from a peice of paper or something. The day/night cycle, maybe i just didnt survive long enough to see day but the whole time it was foggy and dark and when you flee from a battle you get reengaged right away giving you no real chance to flee if more the one guy is near you. These are just a few things right off the top of my head.","August 31, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","3"

Or at least you're open minded to them. If you're not familiar with RPGmaker's engine you may want to familiarize yourself with it before proceeding.  Plenty of youtube videos to give you a preview out there.\n\nSo assuming you've made it this far, congrats!\n\n\nSo this game is a Sandbox...and a bigger one that it looks to be at first glance. I've been playing for a while now and there's still entire sections of the map i haven't even approached yet. Combat is tough, especially in the beginning, and best avoided altogether until you've gone up a few levels, and preferably found your first companion to fight beside you. ProTip: Get Kara. She's hawt.\n\nHunger, Thirst, and Radiation will be your real enemies during these early stages of the game.  Pick your battles carefully. Once you've got some experience under your belt, you can start tackling more combat oriented objectives, and start slaughtering psychos, mutants, and looters for fun and profit.\n\nThe base game has very little story, but then the story isn't really the point of the base game. the Deliverance DLC is another matter, but I haven't gotten to that yet so i'll reserve comment.\n\nFair warning...this game kind of tosses you into the deep end and forces you to sink or swim. Quest objectives don't come with convenient arrows to guide you along. You might get a vague "Go Northeast of here" and sometimes not even that much. You really need to read the initial quest giver's dialogue and refer to your journal entries.\n\nYou'll have to explore a lot and figure out what you're doing. The Map does not give you a "You are here" point of reference either. The only point marked is your house, which you won't be going to often since most of the action takes place quite a ways away from it. There is a community map that is quite helpful but even that will take some trial and error to get the hang of. These elements can be a turnoff to the more casual gamer, but certainly do add to the challenge of the game.\n\nOverall I like it. Just stay out of the water. Seriously, even the puddles will kill you.","April 30","true","8.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Very similar to RPGs of the past, this game relies on map navigation and battles take you to a separate screen where you fight in turn-based combat style.  After a number of hours playing, though, I found the game frustrating and extremely confusing.  Fortunately, I was able to get a hold of the developer who seemed to genuinely care about my input into the game.  The game itself has great potential and, while it is an unfinished product, is continually being updated.  If you want to decide whether to get this game, here are some of the pro's and cons:\nPro's--the exploration is fun and there is a lot of exploring to do in the game.  Fog-of-war makes for intense travel, though this option is toggleable.  The game is constantly being updated and the owner seems to be making an extra effort to change the game and listen to his customer's input, while at the same time continuing on the theme and direction of his game that he's had.  There is a crafting system in the game and many interesting locations to discover, as well as some basic quests you can find to do for good rewards.  The music is nice and creepy, which is aesthetically pleasing for those who like the 'zombie' feel to a game (though there are no zombies in this one!--too bad :().  There are a host of weapons, armor, and items to find and use to give you an advantage over the many enemies out there that will most likely tear you a new hole if you aren't careful (especially at the beginning).\nCon's--while the game has great potential and is improving everyday, it still has it's flaws--and some of them major.  Because it is an RPG-based game, anyone who seeks these elements may be disappointed with the level progression for stat-based characters.  I've played a dex-based character and an endurance-based character and I can honestly say--dex seems nearly meaningless (and even this he has changed a bit recently, so I can't say if this is still ongoing).  If you go all-out endurance and gain access to respectable armor, fighting enemies will be cakewalk, even ones 1-2 levels above you.  If you choose any other statistic to focus on, you'll get ♥♥♥♥♥.  And not just a little bit.  Like--2-3 round ♥♥♥♥ before you die.  The stats I would say are currently extremely unbalanced.  The other major issues I have is, the game completely lacks a glossary of terms and a manual to give even the noob basic pertinent information to survive in his/her adventure.  While they have a 10 page intro, that information should be readily accessible at any given time (because most noobies forget stuff like this).  But even so, the 10 page tutorial doesn't cover many of the frequent abbreviations and/or terms you might be wondering (what the hell does this do?)  Also, there is no functional map.  They have schematics for maps, but none of them work.  Because of how this game is built--its not like a square by square dungeon with easy navigational mapping--I think it's absolutely essential to have a map for this game.  There should be, if nothing else, an offline map we can access--but to my knowledge there isn't even this.  The last thing I found very irritating is the MP bar (and don't confuse this with magic points, as I did and ended up dying a number of times till I realized it wasn't magic!).  In every RPG I have ever played, MP refers to magic points, it is just below the HP bar, and it is the color blue.  Well, their 'moral' bar fits all of these bills, as well as having the abbreviation MP on the status screens...but it's not magic points >_<.  I think the developer will change this, but for any noobie playing this, I can guarantee you would have confused this for magic points unless you read my review.  In addition, pretty much most places you go in to the game and loot--it's all the same stuff.  You're looting meds, food, and drink.  There is the occasional place that has housed some guns (which I've found much later on), but these places are so few and far between it makes little difference.\nWith this said, the game is improving and has great potential.  The owner went out of his way (even spending hours with me offering tips--though not all were good ones--and I was delighted to see that he cared and took the ones he felt would improve his game and has/will implement them.  While I cannot currently offer a thumbs up for this, the game has great potential and I'll be continuing to keep my eye on this game.  It won't be long before this will be a force to recon with other games on the market of a similar nature, like the traditional fallout games and dead frontier online.","September 16, 2015","false","34.6"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","13","30","2","18"
