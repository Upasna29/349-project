Many puzzles in this game require trial-and-error. Many puzzles have random elements. Many puzzles are really long and take over ten minutes to finish. And there's no saving or rewinding -- one wrong move and you have to start the entire level over again, every time.\n\nOh, and there are time limits.\n\nAnd the puzzles can be pretty hard, too. Hope you've been brushing up on your block-pushing.\n\nIf you've played a previous incarnation of Chip's Challenge before, you probably know what you're getting into. You'll find that this is a respectable remake, and you can even mod in the old graphics and sounds if you want. In addition, we've now got achievements, trading cards, and especially steam cloud syncing, which is very welcome.\n\nIf you haven't played this game before, well... just be warned that you're gonna need a lot of time and patience. Chip's Challenge is a test of character. The first time I played, it took me over five years just to get through half the levels.\n\nBut hey, that's just what it takes to get into the Bit Buster's club.

In all honesty, it's Chip's Challenge; how can you go wrong?\n\nFor those more familiar with the Windows version from 1992, this one looks and plays more like the earlier versions of the game, released for the Atari Lynx handheld and various home computers back in 1989 (Such as the Commodore Amiga); as a result, the game does feel a bit different (Most notable, from the preview video above, is the smoother character movement; which makes some levels a bit easier, and others a bit more difficult).\n\nMy only complaint is the audio. The sound effects are a bit too loud, moreso than the background music; with a few of them being rather annoying (I personally opted to import some of the sound effects from the earlier Windows version, but the game does offer the option to disable sound effects entirely if you'd like). As for the music, what they used just seems ill-fitting for this game; sounding more like music from a silent movie than a game about a nerd trying to impress the head of a computer club.\n\nStill, it's worth a purchase; it's a classic.","June 13, 2015","true","12.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

As such, I'll skip explaining it all over again and just quickly say a few things:\n\nChip's Challenge, released in 1989, is a puzzle game with Sokoban elements. I LOVED the complexity and variety in this game. I still do. The old feelings of frustration when you make a button press mistake when you're so close to finishing the level...as well as the old feelings of jubilation when you complete a fiendishly tricky level, are what, in my opinion, makes this game a stone cold classic and get a perfect rating of 10/10.\n\nNOW: onto the remake itself.\nThis appears to feel mostly based on the Lynx version of the game (with moving animations and stuff) as opposed to the old MS version (where you have static moving images). It looks flashy and all but I grew up playing the MS version so I'm VERY used to those sprites. Thankfully, you can mod them (as well as the old songs) into the game and play it that way (check out the guides in the Community Hub).\n\nSpeaking of songs, while I initially planned to mod in the MS version music, I was pleasantly surprised and thrilled that the music was comprised of Scott Joplin piano rags. (They're public domain in case anyone's worried - i.e. perfectly free from copyright and can be used anywhere.) Ragtime has personally been one of my most favourite classical music genres, and while the renditions here are at times a bit too flat (ah well. You don't have a lot of room to put feeling into synthesized beats, I suppose.) and in the case of a few, a bit too fast, I find them still catchy and fun to listen to.\n\nAs far as I have observed, the old glitches and bugs from the MS version have been fixed, meaning some of the old exploits used to speedrun the game are no longer possible. This is part of the reasons where I feel the game loses some of its charm - the bugs were what used to make speedrunning more fun, and in some cases levels much less difficult and impossible. On the other side of the coin, some of the levels can now be played how they were originally intended to, which is a blessing I guess.\n\nDefinitely, for me the most negative aspects are the options menu and the sound effects. Selecting window size as 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x...not very helpful, in my opinion. Not just that but it also requires a program restart. I'd rather work with normal resolution option choices. I didn't quite like the new sound effects, and as another reviewer commented, they overpower the music when left on default settings. Of course, you can change the sound effect volumes, but I'd rather not have done that in the first place.\n\nBut still. This game gets a glowing recommendation from me, almost purely for the nostalgic value you'll get out of it if you've played the old one. Go forth and experience the joys and frustrations of my youth.\n\nALSO MOM I FINALLY BEAT BLOBNET AFTER 10+ YEARS, ARE YOU PROUD OF ME? :D\n\nWhen to buy: You pick the price, I don't care. Anything goes, even full price. I recommend getting the bundle though, you get the long-awaited Chip's Challenge 2 and level editor. Quite a sweet deal.\n\n10/10 (the game as a whole)\n8.5/10 (this remake)","December 7, 2015","true","11.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

However, this is not the case. Far from the case. I've sank so many hours into the Microsoft Best of Entertainment Pack version it's not even funny. I have fond memories playing this game as a child. The pain. The suffering. The heavenly reward of touching the blue glowy wormhole at the end.\n\nOver the years, I've beaten the game numerous times. Meaning about twice. There's hundreds of levels in the game, ranging from extremely simple, to fairly challenging, to stupidly simple and mundane, to 'Jesuschristijustwanttofinishthis‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•levelfor‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ssakeimgonnakillsomebody'.\n\nYeah. Good thing is, the difficulty is paced fairly evenly. The level layouts are genius, the puzzles are world-class. The controls are nice and simple, and the looks nice.\n\nThis brings me to this port.\n\nThe Steam port isn't actually that bad. The real only changes is that the sprites are more of a cross between the original Atari Lynx and the Windows version, which isn't a bad thing. For instance, Chip is actually animated, and the screen scrolls properly, unlike the Windows version, which is more of a jittery mess. I like it. It's easy enough to adjust to.\n\nHowever, the music is a different story. The Lynx version had awesome chiptunes, the Windows had the most nostalgic midis, and this has...'eh'-best piano tracks. They don't exactly fit as well as the others, but it's really nothing special to write home about otherwise. If it's really bothersome, just mute it and throw on whatever you want in the background since the game runs in windowed mode.\n\nOn that, there is a serious issue with the game. It is windowed. Normally this isn't much of an issue with games like this, but it's unscaleable. The default ratio is what you get. For me, I don't have that large of a monitor, and the game is big enough, but for those with larger monitors, such as 4k, this will be a big problem. Hopefully this'll be patched soon. Along with workship support. Seriously, a tilepack to make it look just like the windows version would be godly.\n\nOverall, hell yes get this game. It seems most of the negative reviews are either from people having the display problem or just nostalgiatards who can't stand the difference from the Windows version. Get over it. Enjoy the freaking game. It was $1.99 which is a steal considering you can't even get the original games outside of the Lynx and DOS ports. Oh hey, there's a sequel out now, too. I hope it's good considering the near 20-something-year wait...","May 29, 2015","true","3.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

I say mostly, because there are some minor changes. First off, the music has changed from the original, but it is still the ragtime piano type music that helps make this game relaxing. Sound effects? They're pretty terrible, and while the "Bummer!" on a loss is still great, I have to mute them because of the other annoying sounds.\n\nIf you've never played Chip's Challenge before, it is a fairly long puzzler. However, puzzles will definitely not all be around the same length. You may complete a stage in 20 seconds (seriously, there's stages with a timer that short)... or you may be in for a slog with one of the no-time-limit dirt-block pushing puzzles. It does a lot with the simple tileset and rules of the world, creating some very unique puzzles when all's said and done.\n\nI recommend the game, but mostly for nostalgia purposes. It was fun then, and it's still fun now.

Chip's Challenge was then later ported to multiple formats including the Amiga, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum,[1] DOS, and Windows, included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack and Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack (the last of which was written by Tony Krueger in 1991). Microsoft licensed Chip's Challenge from Epyx to write a DOS and Windows version of the game; while porting the game, the logic was slightly changed from the original version. The Microsoft Windows version is 16-bit so running it natively on 64-bit modern versions of Windows is not possible without using a virtual machine. It has also been converted to the TI-84+ calculator and the TI-89 Titanium.[2]\nNow to the ReviewThis was the cause of early death of every household keyboard in the early 90s, from frustration and repetitive motion. Prepare to fail. A lot. Every puzzle is timed so be on your game. This is what games were back then. Simple yet challenging. WASD to move. Unfortunately the game doesn't have the original unlock codes when you finish a level, so you'll have to play it all in one playthrough.\nThe music that has been added in with #1 for the Chip's Challenge 2's release is mutable so that's a huge plus. It still has it's original sound effects.","June 3, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Admittedly, the music from the Lynx version was miles better than this, but that is easily rectified, due to some clever folks on here modding it in.  A great time waster of a game, and one of my all time favorites at sucking you in, for that one more try at the level you cant beat.  We never had saves back then, so you had to beat it to get code for next level.

A newer version of the game that runs on 64 bit is very welcome indeed! I'd admit, perhaps I'm biased because of the nostalgia. Yet I'd vouch, mechanically, this game isn't dated at all. I'd compare it to Sokoban, y'know, that block moving puzzle, but I'd say that this game has a lot more into it, it'd pull you in quite fast, with mechanics that's even deeper than Sokoban. Perhaps the only thing that I do not like about the current version is that the bgm/music isn't quite pleasant to the ears.\n\nAs a person who memorized the steps to most of the puzzles, it's nice to own the puzzles.

The AI logic doesn't have the same timings, so you can't do things like snatch chips from right in front of teeth anymore. There is added animation for blocks hitting the water, so you have to wait a lot of frames to step on a block right after pushing it in the water, which causes some issues in levels where you push a lot of blocks in the water.

The Windows version had 2 unforgettable themes, while the LYNX had some cool robotic tunes. The sound effects are miserable. The other 2 versions had nice laid-back sound effects while this one has cheap, grating, out-of-place sound effects.\nOn the bright side, it says "Bummer" when you die.\n\nGRAPHICS & ANIMATION\nUgly ugly ugly. The sprites look miserably out of place with tiles and backgrounds. The time it takes to get from tile to tile seems a little long/slippery. The frames of animation are oddly smooth for what is taking place. Think PopCap games.\n\nAnd without those two features, why even bother remaking the game?\nIn conclusion, this game looks and feels like the final product of a slapped together how-to-use GameMaker tutorial.

The originals were so much better.\n\nYou would think that the now-'smoothed' movement would make the gameplay more seamless, but in fact it makes it unncessarily tedious and more error prone. In the original, movements were fairly discrete, so there was no ambiguity with regards to timing of movements. Whereas in the original I could hold down the arrow keys without too much fear of overstepping, in this version I find myself tapping the keys because of how aggressive the game handles movement. The lack of an undo feature means that you could easily waste half an hour on a puzzle that otherwise takes 3 minutes to solve, simply because you accidentally held a key for two long, or accidentally tapped the wrong key. (No, I do not believe the level skip feature makes up for this inexcusable omission.)\n\nThe game is intended to be a puzzle game, not an action game; I should not have to micromanage my movements in relation to enemies apart from general high-level strategy!\n\nI loved the original, but this remake is so very disappointing. As far as I've concerned, I've paid for the game, so I feel entitled to download a bootleg of the original and play that one instead of this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ized version.","June 14, 2015","false","8.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","3","9","2","7"
