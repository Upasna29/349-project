"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/recommended/299260/","Spartan717","Echo419","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/","507 products in account","Android game\n\nCommando Jack is an android port of the same game now on steam.\n\nThere is barely any story at all. Basically, aliens have invaded earth and it's up to Commando Jack to stop them.\n\nGameplay is a mix of tower defence and first person shooting. Each level starts you off on one side of the map with a turret, trying to defend against the alien invasion. You have limited time at the start to build towers and set traps for defences before the waves begin. Besides building defences you can also switch to your main turret and shoot the aliens via first-person. Enemy waves get more numerous and stronger as the level progresses. The aliens will move towards you main turret and try to destroy it, which results in a gameover should it happen. After each level, you will earn up to 3 stars depending on whether the enemy was able to attack your main turret or not. You also earn credits, which are used to buy/upgrade turrets at the store before each level. There are variety of aliens including snipers, tanks standards and elemental which all have certain strengths and weaknesses. A variety of turrets are also available including machine gun, rockets, mines, lasers and sand bags. One of the problems I found was that when you upgrade turrets' you don't know how the turret was improved as you don't get to see any statistics.\n\nGraphics aren't great. The android history, shows off on the low detailed models for guns, environment, turrets (everything really).\n\nSound effects are quite poor. Weapons sounds are basic. Background music is forgettable. There is not voice acting in the game.\n\nUnless this game is highly discounted, I recommend that you stay clear of this game. It's not that this game is terrible, its just that there are dozens of games which do a better job at representing the 'tower defence genre' and cheaper too.","May 10, 2015","false","1.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/299260/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","The tower defense game Commando Jack originally made its way to iPhones way back in 2012, but just recently its developer Colossal Games released this on Steam. So the question on everyone’s mind right now is: is this a ‘quick’ cash-in or this is a port that all PC gamers can be content with ?\n\nAnd while I’m definitely going to explain more about the game in just a minute I can already answer the question I just brought up: it’s absolutely a game made to make some extra money. No, this isn’t a bad game per se, it’s just not optimized for us PC gamers: the game starts instantly with the first mission, no menus or anything, video options aren’t there and it forces a low resolution game into fullscreen, making the whole thing look blurry as a result (Alt+Enter does work, mind you). Which to me, looks like a really bad start, wouldn’t you agree ?\nThankfully Commando Jack is one of the better tower defense titles out there, and this one gives you the opportunity to shoot some aliens yourself, in first person view. It doesn’t use in-app purchases like the iOS version does, but it does have things like ‘Free coins’ banners at the top of the screen when you’re not killing enemies. It’s not even subtle. Unfortunately, these coins have to be used to buy and upgrade turrets, buy power-ups and also to upgrade your stationary gun, so there’s no way to just not click on it. You’ll get coins by finishing missions, clicking on a Free Coins button every day or by hacking into aliens’ accounts (which can also be done once a day). I never seemed to run out of cash during my game sessions; the game hands out large amounts of coins at the same time. So why does it have to be so in-your-face then ? I honestly have no idea.\nThere are 45 campaign missions to finish, and then there’s also Endless mode, Mixed mode (normal enemies mixed with fire and ice enemies) and Elemental mode, which throws only ice and fire enemies at you. There are special towers for both these ice and fire enemies, and special ammo can be bought for your stationary gun. Levels aren’t just squares, they have all kind of different shapes and because of that It’s not always easy to create a long, difficult maze for enemies to walk through.\nIf an enemy gets through you can always go to your stationary gun with the press of a button and kill them yourself. However, your gun can also overheat so it’s necessary to use it with caution. Snipers can also spawn on the battlefield, out of view, and they can only be killed in first person view. It’s fun, but the first few times you might not notice them quickly enough and you’ll probably see your base’s health drop within seconds. After that you’ll most likely pay more attention to your surroundings.\nOther than all of things I just mentioned this is your basic tower defense game. That’s not meant as a negative argument, but it’s the same thing as, let’s say, point-and-click adventures. They’re usually the same as far as gameplay is concerned, but sometimes they have a little bit more variety. The same goes for Commando Jack.\n\nSo, apart from the cluttered user interface and the non-existent video options, what’s there to say about this game technically ? Well, the models use some sharp textures, which is good, but the models on the other hand are blocky. Some of it seems intentional, some of it doesn’t. The game does a nice job at showing you landmarks and other country related objects in each of the different locations. London has a Big Ben tower and Japan has cherry trees, for example.\nThe music seems to change whenever you change cities, so if you’re fighting in Japan you’ll hear music with Japanese influences. The sound effects overall are also very good and clear.\nGame length also seems to be good; this could take you several hours to tens of hours if you want to 100% the entire game. I personally think it’s best played in smaller sessions.\n\nCommando Jack doesn’t completely reinvent the genre but the gameplay is fun enough as long as you can ignore the things that clearly show we’re dealing with an iOS port here. From a technical viewpoint I would not recommend it, but as a game I think I would. But just barely. And that’s mainly the reason why this gets a below average rating in my book.\n\n[Rating: 63/100]","August 28, 2014","true","3.8"," 36 of 64 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","36","64","0","0"

I suppose the closest game I can equate it with would be Plants Verses Zombies, only with a Military fighting an Alien Invasion twist, multiple boards to play on, and an array of purchasable weaponry, designed to combat various threats. You earn coins by completing levels, which you are graded on similar to the 3 star level grading system on many Facebook games. You can spend those coins upgrading your weapons, to combat various alien threats. Each board has a different layout, and the layout changes and becomes more complicated depending on the difficulty setting you are playing at. The game allows for Easy play, which is fairly straight-forward and is recommended for the casual player, Medium, Hard, and Extreme, for only the most serious of gamers. You are tasked with stopping Alien threats, which come in the form of a portal, after which you must defeat waves of aliens, by placing weapons in strategic places to destroy the aliens as they advance from the portal. This game really took me by surprise and was a lot of fun to play. It is a very inexpensive game, fun, and easy to learn, so I would give it a thumbs up if it sounds like the sort of game you would enjoy. I don't think you will be disappointed.","May 27, 2015","true","0.4"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

It only takes some cursory browsing to see all the bizarre raving from (what I can only imagine to be) sorely out of context quotes and even nominations for awards. Yet after only a very brief period of play in which I made it through the tutorial and first couple levels, it was overwhelmingly clear that this game was just another bland mobile port.\n\nAt first glance Commando Jack would strike you as a typical mobile shovelware quality tower defense; however, upon digging into the game a little deeper you will discover that it is in fact.. exactly what it appears to be. The store page has GameTrailers hailing it as “...unlike anything we’ve ever played before.” It pulls into question the actual amount of time anyone at GT has ever really been in the gaming community. “Tower defense with a first-person twist!” proclaims another hideously flagrant screenshot. On and on these quotes go, yet the game is bad. Even if I had gotten this on my android phone or tablet I would have been revolted by the graphics, infuriated by the responsiveness of controlling the turret and utterly bored at the experience of playing yet another tower defense game.\n\nI’m so very glad I spent nothing on this game, that is all it’s worth.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/299260/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Game sucks. Clearly a mobile game. No graphic or control settings in game at all. Terrible resolution can't change. The game home page and original menus is confusing and not easily accessed. The controls/different menus in game are not helpful and not explained. Switching back and forth between turret and placing weapons is annoying and not quick. Buttons that are used on computer and should do certain things don't work or do anything and you have to use mouse. A lot of turrets you don't know what they do or what they are useful for an aren't explained well. Levels suck and can only place towers in certain spots, and in some levels they can just get around them for no apparent reason. Can't maze or make your own setup because some levels are just made that way because it makes no sense. Clearly a free-to place game with huge banner for getting coins which you use in game, which you can like their facebook page to get more off, shoddy marketing.\n\nYou can level up new towers but also upgrade them, 2 different systems that seem to do the same thing but is unclear. Game gives you no idea what effect you buying upgrades does. Towers seem undewhelming. You have to look at certain guys come and plan your towers accordingly. No clue which towers are needed and which are useful, and sucky game menues and UI doesn't help. Half of the buttons you can click on and powers you use aren't explained. No story. Clearly 0 effort put into bringing this game to PC/steam. Hell it's even hard to figure out how to exit the game, probably on purpose because everyone who starts it up would instantly want to. Not worth any money, I got it for free and I'm still disappointed and feel ripped off. 3/10.","July 11, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is actually put together decently for a mobile port and can be somewhat entertaining. The main problem with it is that I noticed that you do everything with the mouse and there are no real meaningful keyboard shortcuts just some basic ones. You should have more configuration options but you don't. That and the fact that it is a poor mans version of OTTTD or Sanctum 2, I won't put any more time in it than the initial 30 minutes sinced those two games are far superior than this.\n\nMany much better TD games exist including the two I mentioned where your time will be much more well spent than here. The regular price for this of $10 is laughable, $5 or less is more like it. I got it for free from indiegala.com but I will have much more fun playing other TD games I have.","March 31, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
