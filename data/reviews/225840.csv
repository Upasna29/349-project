Please note that this was in an era where communication using smartphones was yet to be invented. Sven Co-op for us was what social media is now for the kids. Yes, although hard to imagine for youngsters nowadays, back then we also played outside at times, but when we had to be home in order to accomplish homework tasks, our only escape from this by society accepted torment was to play online multiplayer games with each other - most of them being first person shooters.\n\nNow, a decade later, Sven Co-op finally made it to Steam. But where are those friends now? Some of them have been lost in time, few I still play games with. But never Sven Co-op. Not Sven Co-op. Am I the only one stuck in time, thriving on nostalgia? I recently played again, after all those years. It's still great, but it's not the same anymore.\n\nSven Co-op was part of a man's teen life. When you're reading this and playing Sven Co-op within one, perhaps several decades, remember that this is my legacy. Remember the sentiment this game has brought to a grown-up man yearning for his youth.","May 3","true","3.3"," 167 of 181 people (92%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","92","167","181","68","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonroeEffect/recommended/225840/","MonroeEffect","Muzze the Mudslime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonroeEffect/","92 products in account","Correct me if I am wrong, but the ADHD children of this age are not the target audience of this game. Based on the negative reviews shown to me, these are the kinds of people making a lot of the bad reviews. They seem hastily written by semi-illiterates used to the numerous, and very often poorly made, free games on Steam.\n\nYou can't really blame them for their opinions, though. It's a bit like how children who are used to eating only tasty fast food will prefer fast food over a nutritious, healthy meal. The problem is that they will always prefer this. They're used to a yearly CoD release with pretty graphics and mindless shooting, not puzzles, exploration and cooperation. This is why a game like Sven Co-op will never get the recognition that it deserves; poorly made but easier alternatives. Teaching yourself to digest something real requires motivation, of which said people have none, since there is a steady supply of junk always ready on their plates.\n\nI'd call this a blessing in disguise, however. By not compromising with modern audiences, the developers have managed to stay true to the spirit of a now 17 year old game. They haven't sold out their game, and I am personally grateful for that. You see, this keeps away the stupid - the average 2016 consumer of video games - which keeps the game in its normal state, since nothing has to be dumbed down for a quick buck. For instance, I love that on every server I've played on, people are still capable of assisting each other. Firefights, puzzles and healing each other all comes naturally. This is not possible on an average server in a game like Team Fortress 2, and feels very unique to Sven Coop.\n\nIt's too bad that today, it seems you either have to make a great game that a few people might really like, or a horrible, generic piece of fast food that everyone will want to consume. It's truly fantastic to see the game finally reach Steam though. A group of people idealistic and interested enough to stick by a Half-Life 1 mod for 17 years is something very special. Someone like that is capable of great things, Sven-Coop being a prime example. They deserve a great deal of thanks for this mod. I am so glad to be playing it again after all these years.\n\nI recommend this game to any patient lover of the fluid gameplay that the Half-Life 1 engine provides. The amazing and original map design also deserves mention. You will know how much of an understatement this when you play the game. Map series like ‘sc_tetris’, ‘They’ and good old ‘Toonrun’ spring to mind. I highly recommend that you try these, if you decide to test out the game.\n\nHave fun!","March 18","true","9.7"," 215 of 259 people (83%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","83","215","259","40","35"

You can be a soldier in the middle of the desert, bombing critical locations, or a civilian trying to survive a zombie onslaught (with permadeath!). Or, even a wacky toon world, filled with clowny monsters. Maybe you like surreal maps? There's a couple, too. Wanna play Afraid Of Monsters with friends, so you don't get scared? Say no more. It's one of the most versatile mods I've seen. Maps have some of the most heavy customization you can expect from, well, an engine from 1998 (well, it has some several tweaks, but still).\n\nGraphics look amazing. Enemies look better than ever, with HD models and improved animations. Guns look impressive too, and don't get me started on the textures. Sounds have been improved over the years (never forget 4.0's popcorn MP5) and you can change them pretty easily too.\n\nCommunity is still active (After 10 minutes from the release I stumbled upon a server with 32 slots - and it was full) pumping new content fairly often.\n\nAnd all of this?\nFor free.\n\nGo on, download it.

I got various excuses as to why it wasn't possible. Mostly that Valve would be hesitant to provide access unless the team proved that they could release the game. When the game was finally released, it looked like Valve didn't even care. They greenlit the release far too soon to have tested the HLSP campaign, and when the NDA request was submitted, they sent a Source Engine NDA in return. The rest of the team got GoldSource NDAs only. To them, it was the same thing. They really didn't care, but Sniper spun the possibility as the reason for not doing so. The real reason is that he didn't want anyone to actually work on the engine. Unless he can boss you around, you can't work on it.\n\nAfter a month of working on the engine, and getting pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at Sniper for constantly complaining, he locked me out of all of the code repositories. They were going to discuss how to handle access. By that point i'd had arguments with Sniper about the way he handles things several times. Being patient doesn't work, reasoning with him doesn't work. It's pretty clear that to him, SC is his project. It belongs to him. I got angry at him. Very angry. I took it too far, and i was too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off to care. I took every complaint anyone had ever had about him and put it on the table. It didn't matter. I refused to take part in a voice chat meeting. Sniper acted pretty smug afterwards so no points for guessing what happened there. 2 days later Dynamite asked if my code commit access was to be restored. Clearly they had no intention of doing so. Sniper didn't want me to get any more work done.\n\nThat's when i decided to leave. I told them not to talk to me again, since i already knew where it was going. They didn't stop so i demanded they remove the last month of work i'd done (everything since 5.0.3). Even that didn't change the situation. SC's their property and they will do whatever they want with it. I straight up told them that people were going to leave if Sniper were allowed to continue doing things like he always has. That people were tired of it. They didn't listen, and so people left. They blame me for that too.\n\nI gave them a choice: me or Sniper. Why? Because everything else i'd tried failed. I can't do my job if he keeps blocking me at every turn. Without him, you'd already have had the svc_bad fix. It might never have been in the public release to begin with. It happened during internal testing as well. If i had had engine access then, i would've investigated.\n\nI told them they could use that month worth of work on certain conditions. They have to put more effort into communicating with each-other and the community, find people to help out with major problems, make the forums easier to work with (you can easily miss stuff here, and most of my threads were either missed or ignored), and not to bother me with Angelscript issues, since they didn't appreciate my efforts.\n\nThey didn't even try. And they kept my work. I gave them permission to use it regardless a few days ago, since there's no point in demanding its removal. It would only hurt the people that play the game.\n\nDid i take it too far? Yes. Should i make posts like this? No. Would the situation have improved had things been done differently? I doubt it. People have tried and failed to deal with Sniper's attitude over the years. I took a different approach to try and change things. But i can't change people's minds. I want what's best for the community. That's why i'm here. That's why i'm still here.\nI don't believe that Sniper has any intention of actually listening to people's requests. He treats this like a personal project. He wants it done a certain way and nobody can change that.\n\nI don't like this situation any more than anybody else. I don't want drama. I don't want to make you-or-me type demands. But Sniper does whatever he wants. Adam told me he can boss people around because he pays the bills. I call that bribery. If i won the lottery and paid all the bills, would i be allowed to make all of the decisions? I doubt it. The situation escalated to this point because Sniper believes that he owns Sven Co-op. He doesn't. If anything, he's damn near killed it on multiple occasions. Demanding that every programmer notify him of every change that they make, creating a bottleneck. Demotivating team members. He clearly thinks of himself as a dictator, the only person qualified to make the right decision. If it weren't for those who joined the team, put in a great deal of effort and then got bullied out by him, SC would've died by now. But since he can outlast people through force, he thinks he's right.\n\nI'm no better than him for lowering myself to his level. I got angry. I insulted him. I insulted others. I am sorry for that, but i will not apologize for doing what's best for you. I just solved yet another major problem that this game has. I've reported more bugs this week alone than the average person reports in a lifetime. And i got complaints about it because i showed some code from the game to prove it. If i had access to the game proper, i could've fixed these problems myself right away, and then provided a public beta so people can try it out. The team on the other hand is filled with people that have no time to work on the game, yet try to assign all of the important stuff to themselves, getting nothing done in the process. Half a dozen team members left after i did. Apparently this isn't ringing any bells, because they're all pointing their fingers at me.\n\nAs i said before, if you knew the truth, you'd be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at all of us. I didn't handle it well, but neither did they. I don't know what to do here. I've exhausted every single option i can think of. Going public was the last thing i could do. The only alternative is leaving and hoping that with me gone, the situation will improve, but i seriously doubt that will happen.\n\nIf i hadn't been here, 5.0 might never have been released. And even if it had, with no Angelscript, and no fixes for Metamod, server operators wouldn't have stuck around for long. You'd have had no server plugins, no admin commands, no XP mod. Would it have survived? Do you think Sniper would've fixed Metamod? Perhaps. But seeing as it was broken in several ways, including console commands not being handled correctly in some cases, people might have just given up and left. I don't want SC to die. I want it to thrive. And i can make that happen.\n\nSniper seems intent on taking several years to deal with major issues. He seems to think that people will stick around forever. There are barely any new maps being made. People have lost interest. And the dev team seems to be doing everything they can to shut down any attempt at making progress. I just solved a bunch of problems for you, and you're being a bunch of ungrateful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Again! Put anyone else in my position and they'd have left a long time ago. It's because i'm so persistent that things got so bad, since i didn't quit when the situation looked like it wasn't going to change, but my persistence has also gotten a lot of good things done.\n\nI don't know what else to do. I doubt this post will stay up for long, and i'll probably be banned for it. But at least i've tried to do everything that i could.

If you enjoy this game but want a semi-prettier experience, Synergy is a similarly designed mod for Half Life 2 but you will need to own HL2 on Steam to play.","January 25","true","7.8"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","19","23","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrfreedon/recommended/225840/","mrfreedon","Gorman Freedon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrfreedon/","19 products in account","I'm mainly a console game and I'm relatively new to Steam. I adore the Half-Life saga, have no money on my account, and have a cruddy laptop, so me and Sven Co-Op are a match made in heaven; it's Half-Life, it's free, and my computer can handle the horribly outdated graphics! (Don't get me wrong, the game does look really nice for something that came at the turn of the century) Before I saw on GameInformer.com that Sven Co-Op was being released on Steam for free, I had no idea the mod existed, and I didn't have a clue what I was doing going in. I was expecting Sven Co-Op to be nothing more than a free pass to play the original Half-Life, so I was initially disappointed when I joined a random server only to find myself fighting zombies whilst trying my best to learn the controls. However, after I spent several hours mastering the controls and weapons, I was hooked. Slaying endless waves of enemies, role-playing with fantasy textures, and completing Mario-themed parkour courses is just as fun as the main game, but when you finally do find a campaign server, the fun reaches its height. I don't think I'll ever forget completing the last stretch of the game with 30 other people. The lag was insane, but it was worth it simply for the laughs I got from the sight of all of us crammed into a gondola while the G-Man gave his speech. If you're lucky, you might also come across a PvP server. I've only played a few, but they were all awesome -- especially this server called ModRiot that had CTF with classes!\n\nIt's also worth noting that Sven features some awesome weapons and NPCs not found in HL1 or its expansions. New weapons include the Uzi, which can be dual weilded, and the MP5A3, a scoped assault rifle. Some of the new NPCs are the minigun-weilding Human Sergeant and Zombie Barney. Some of the weapons from Half-Life and Opposing Force have been tweaked as well -- the SPAS-12 shotgun's secondary is full auto instead of a double-barrel shot; the .357 Magnum has a scope; the MP5 fires in 3-round bursts (ala Halo's Battle Rifle) instead of full auto and has to reload grenades; and the RPG's laser guide can be toggled on and off\n\nAll of this stuff is great, but the best part about Sven is that unlike GMod, this game's HL2 equivalent, the fanbase isn't composed of mainly squeaky voiced teens that spout out racial slurs - I only encountered one, and everyone else I played with was nice.\n\nThe only issue I have with Sven now that I'm experienced is that I was unable to add any servers to my favorites list. Every time I go to the list, none of the servers show up. If there is a way to fix this, please comment below, becuase having searching my history for fun servers is aggravating.\n\nI recommend Sven Co-Op to any fan of Half-Life, and if you played this mod when it was in its youth, than you have no reason not to take an admission-free trip down memory lane. If you're a n00b like I was, than the game will take some getting used to, but you'll have a blast once you're prepared.\n\nPROS\nHalf the Life for none of the price!\nAwesome user-made maps\nWeapons and NPCs not in vanilla HL1\nGreat fanbase CONS\nNot friendly to newbies\nFavorites list doesn't work VERDICT : 8.5 out of 10, would play again\n\nFirst Black Mesa, than this, and now Prospekt ...

(3.0 and prior).\n\nA few months ago when asking Adam over Twitter, I got the reply "We removed that?" back. Way to know your own product.\nShortly ago, when asking about it on the Steam Subforum, I got a "just edit the skill.cfg" back from Sniper. Yeah, I know how to make grenades not do any damage, that still won't make them magically make me get a boost from them.\n\nEx-Developers are getting banned left and right for not bowing down to the established "IN" Group.\nCommunity Members, some of those who are insanely active and helped keeping the mod alive over all these years (CryoKeen among others), get banned for daring to speak about those issues. Speak about a Cry Of Fear Dejavu.\nI can tell you that this review (as other negative ones that were posted after Solokiller going public) will be flagged & I will not be able to change it further, pretty much proving all points I and others are making. Just look at the way Sniper & Adam reply to people on the official forum and the steam community section, you'll see what I am talking about. Adam has a history of siding with power-abusing people tho, just check out the Multiplay servers when User 'Katie' is online and you see what I mean.\n\nIt just makes me sad that something that had such passionate people behind it now probably dies out because of the huge ego of one of the developers who hides behind a really edgy attitude against everyone and abuses his power censoring everyone who dares to speak out on the problem at hand. I wasn't sure at first if I should even get into this, for the fear of getting banned for it, but damn, I haven't gave a crap about Rumpel being on a power-trip & got banned for speaking out on him way back when the CoF community died (and it did die like I said it would), so why start now?\n\nI halted all further development on stuff I had worked for on Sven5, have shut down my server & hope that others will also stop supporting it 'til this situation gets handled in a professional manner (banning everyone and making half-♥♥♥♥♥ damage control posts is not professional).\nLose your attitude and maybe appreciate the people that want to help you make this mod the greatest of all Goldsrc mods.","June 6","false","52.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NLR_SilverWarden/recommended/225840/","NLR_SilverWarden","Silver Warden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NLR_SilverWarden/","3 products in account","Here's the deal: if you have a group of friends that you can play with, this game is perfect. If you happen to come across a decently sized group of random people that are more or less nice and actually try to have an intelligent gaming session, this game can be very enjoyable. However, at the moment, joining random servers usually results in a huge unplayable mess with 20+ people running around aimlessly, breaking scripts, blocking characters, getting stuck in doors and on the elevators and screaming into their mics. I've played for 3.2 hours, and 90% of the time the experience was extremely random and sometimes... questionable.\n\nThis is as raw as it gets: you will get insulted, kicked for no reason, you will be stuck on one level just because someone decided to block the passage, in a group of 30 people your actual skills mean nothing, and the majority of your kills will be thanks to chance, not to your accuracy or speed. Pretty much everyone playing knows the Half-Life levels inside out, so 50% of players always try to speedrun the maps, which can be somewhat annoying. But I guess this is how it's always been, so nothing new, really.\n\nBut then you might end up in a game with players who actually TRY to get some enjoyment out of the deal, and the experience changes drastically! Suddenly, you're actually working as a team, backing each other up, and trying to progress at a normal pace, having a nice playful chat and even roleplaying sometimes. It is a real pity that this doesn't happen often.\n\nAs you can see, though, I AM recommending Sven Coop, because when it functions as intended, it truly shines. From a technical standpoint, it's a very nice piece of work, the amount of content here is huge - custom maps, models, game types, sounds, improved graphics and overall optimization, AND you get Half-Life for free. But if you are like me, and you prefer your game to have at least SOME sort of sense and purpose, and you actually want to have a really good time, go gather your friends, make a server, lock it up, and play like that. Or, create a topic, find people willing to play along, filter out everyone else, and then play with them. Otherwise, you're gonna end up in a rollercoster or randomness, and your satisfaction, or even good mood, is NOT guaranteed.","January 23","true","17.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Everyone including myself were waiting for this moment. I've been playing Sven Co-op since 4.8 and i still have it. I wont be needing it anymore now that the newest version is the game itself, 5.0.\n\nNow that is on Steam i'm giving out the statistics. It is a great GAME, a game that continues its way just like the mod did except adding more stuff in it thats not in 4.8. The game is heavily focused on teamwork against bot controlled enemies. Whether its aliens, marines, nazis, you name it. You play as any character based from either Half-Life or any other games (Such as the Doomguy in Doom, Young Link from Zelda, Mario from Mario games, etc.).\n\nThe maps are heavily on campaign, so your objective is to reach through it whether by fighting enemies, solve puzzles, or both. Theres a HUGE amount of maps you can play on. If you are suddenly on the loading screen, it means someone has reached the end of the map which causes a new map to load up. Also keep noted the guns you see, sometimes you get different guns depends on the campaign you play (such as the thompson if played in WWII maps).\n\nThere is Half life maps, but there are also modded maps. If you are feeling for adventure, you came in the right place.\n\nGive yourself time to try the game when you can and while you still can. Note that low players does not always mean a bad thing, being yourself is whats worst since it'll make the game harder playing by yourself. Having just one person with you is enough, bringing more will bring on the carnage. The game may be too easy for you if you bring on the best team or just simply bring LOTS of people with you. You want a fair fun game where you are fighting through with others as a team.\n\nThe bosses also are VERY promising in most maps. Some maps has bosses, some dont. But you will see one at some point depending on the map you are playing on.\n\nI truly recommend this to anyone, its going to be a blast when playing this.","January 23","true","4.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

With no freemium purchases or microtransactions, you get the whole package in this bundle.\n\nMods are built into Sven Co-op to allow Roleplays, Labyrinths, Quests and much, much more on multiple servers. With Sven Co-op having a proactive community and the ability to make a standard Half-Life Vanilla server yourself, one can not get bored. I would recommend inviting all of your friends who love the Half Life series over to Sven and playing on your own server with them, nothing as hectic as 'partially' co-ordinated strikes against zombies, whilst only having crowbars. The interesting bit behind Sven Co-op however is the customization, with you able to change the colour of your 'avatar', which ranges from the models Sven Co-op has, the female versions of Gordon, Gordon himself, Barney, alternative skins, a Jill Valentine 'Half Life' style skin, Robots, Marines [Including Shephard from Opposing Force] and even Ivan the Space Biker! [The original Gordon].\nWith Sven Co-op allowing you to download extras, such as the campaigns for Blue Shift and Opposing Force respectively, you will not feel a sense of repetition in the campaign and when you're all done, you can go back to the Mod-built servers.\n\nOverall Sven Co-op I recommend for anybody who wants a pure free-to-play game, wants to reminisce the old days of gaming or has wanted Half Life [1] to be Co-op. There is something in Sven to please everyone, ignore the negatives that people say, it is as easy to leave a server or mute the players and proceed on. The positives are only found by actually searching, I was unlucky as I automatically connected to a Russian Mod/RP Server, where everyone was screaming Russian over the microphone. I simply disconnected and joined a Vanilla server manually, from there on, it was easy going.\n\nOn a rating of 1 to 10, I would give Sven Co-op a 9.5/10, as it is the best it can be, the only downsides are.. You guessed it! The lack of 'Instructions' when you start up the game and the small amount of 'bugs' that are present, but are generally NOT gamebraking: I do not play this on a 'Gaming Rig', I play this on my Laptop and this game runs very smoothly for a £200 Laptop. With the developers quite pro-active themselves, the bugs are not around for quite long before they get patched.\n\nSven Co-op in my eyes, is one of the best mods on the Half Life series and does not require anything at all, not even the base game to play. I would recommend this to anyone who asks me about Sven Co-op.","April 4","true","1.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

At least 2 people suffice for a good ol' AI ♥♥♥♥ beating. Not a lot to say about this one, I'm afraid, its just super-duper massive fun for even a couple of people playing along, co-op version of Half Life, along with a BUNCH of CUSTOM things, ranging from reskinned and brand new sounds for existing weapons, and new playermodels, not only that, but the game comes shipped with a crap ton of maps!

There are plenty of maps to play on other than the Half Life story.\n\nSven Co-op is at this point one of the oldest received and best games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not, well what the hell are you doing reading this review? You need install this game straight away and play it right now.\n\nThe game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles. Not to mention the the graphic engine is rather old, it's still doing quite well.\n\nFor a game that came out back in 1999 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it still looks decent and I experienced zero problems while playing the game. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.\n\nThe game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Xen battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.\n\nApart from the Sven Co-op maps, the Half Life campaign doesn't provide any replayability. There is enough user created content to keep you interested and the game is updated frequently\n\nIn the end Sven Co-op is a fantastic game. It's a must play for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.\n\n9.5/10 - A must play","February 3","true","60.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Sven coop also comes with a couple of custom maps/ campaigns included as a default package. and that's not counting the amount of downloadble custom maps.\n\nSince i'm sure you can figure out sven co-op and it's legacy/popularity for yourself. The 5.0 update adds steam intergration and survival mode, which in my opinion though, i get what they're trying do, forcing players to take caution and work more as a team. but it gets chaotic when large groups of players are involved (32 players nugha). if it's not already tested, i'd like to see a lives system although it could ruin gamemode as a whole (i'm not a ♥♥♥♥ing developer so it's really up to them).\n\nOverall though, its pretty a darn enjoyable experience for "playing half life with friends". The campaign re-implementation (for half-life) has been improved from what i've played now and last time i played (which wasn't much to be honest) . It flows more naturally instead of blockading you and having players kill enimies to remove said blockade. maps also add variety to sven, even replacing weapons and their functions.now, sure it may not be a Triple Ay videyo game or something that changes the medium (*cough* tumblrtale), but if you haven't played sven coop. ♥♥♥♥ off, are you kidding me? if you're returning for the 5.0 release its worth your time wether or not your the former or latter, you worthless cuckoldsisweartogod.\n\nChildren can also ♥♥♥♥ off.

You ever dreamed about running through the halls of Sector C with 12 other HEVsuits and gmen? You can do it here. You ever wanted to explore the tunnels in Foxtrot Uniform with other Soldiers armed with M60s? Yup! You want to play the horror mods of They Hunger and Afraid of Monsters with friends? Sven Co-op has you covered, you get the idea.\n\nOne of the oldest Half-Life 1 mods in exsistance, Sven Co-op has been in development since 1999 and with this steam release comes it's 5.0 version which has added extra functionallity for map creators to toy around with, such as inventory systems to improve map flexibillity and creative oppurtunity. The Mod itself already has so much content to experience, it tweaks weapons, improves animations, custom models, adds some new toys, comes with it's own library of maps for you ready to play and makes some adjustments to the original Half-Life 1, Opposing Force and Blue Shift maps to acommodate for the higher player numbers, meaning that proper cooperation with your crowbar banging fellows is essential to get past some tough situations. Everybody comes equipped with a medkit which allows it's operators to heal injuired team mates or even revive fallen allies to get them back up and running, you can even give ammo to people if they've ran out of shotgun shells.\n\nSo many hours of my weekends have been lost to the vast amount of things to do in Sven Co-op, Nights spent laughing with friends at the brutally unforgiving soldier AI who'll murder anybody who thinks they can withstand a squad of the HECU. Evenings of exploring cartoonish comedic maps where you need to stand on pannels that'll flip you supposidly into a wall where instead it'll just gib you, and of course you can never forget scaring that one friend who for some reason agreed to play horror maps late into the early hours of the morning.\n\nSven Co-op is the king of all Half-Life mods, new maps are released pretty much everyday on the SCmap database with already over 300 unique maps to download and play and with the improvements to the overall engine, you can hopefully expect some even better maps to soon follow. The potential longevity you can get from this is astounding. It's the ultimate party game for fans of the anthology and you can play it entirely free of charge.","January 23","true","0.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This is for you man.\n\nWhat you're about to play is an incredible multiplayer Cooperative game that was originally a MOD for Half-Life 1, It's got hundreds of maps to choose from where you can team up with other players to solve puzzles, you get to play maps just for entertainment purposes, or you can go in certain maps, guns blazing. You can also play through the entire Half-life 1 campaign that's completely revamped just for multiplayer, It also includes They Hunger, an old mod that came out right around the same time Sven co-op did, the only issue with this is that it doesn't contain chaper 3 of the campaign. If you're interested in getting more maps for sven coop, you can visit the sven co-op map database on the web http://scmapdb.com/\n\nSo there you have it, please, you must check out Sven Co-op, this is a game filled with action and nostalgia all over.\n\nPros:\nTeam based mutliplayer Co-op!\n\nTons of maps.\n\nAction packed.\n\nThe Option to change player models & color schemes.\n\nWorkshop (in progress!)\n\nHalf-Life campaign Included! (For free!)\n\nChallenging gameplay.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\nFPS drop for low-in PC's or laptop's when other players turn on there flashlights or entering certain environments, simple, just upgrade your toa$ter.\n\nWhen you create your own server, players are unable to join you unless you opened your ports in your router to get a solid connection, or you'll have to install a program called Hamachi, when you become the host of a server it needs to be independent just like the video game Left 4 dead when you create a lobby, in Left 4 Dead as an example, players are able to join you without all of this hassle.\n\nIt needs more spray logos.\n\nWell that's all for now, enjoy and have fun!","February 1","true","31.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It uses the Half-Life 1 game engine but it is completely free and you don't need to buy HL1; as a result the graphics are below-average but nostalgic (but it's free!).\n\nIf you join a server with enough players (at least 2 or 3) who know what they're doing, you don't have to know too much about what's happening but can still help out and learn as you go along.\n\nTypical experience:\n- Join server. Start on a Half-Life 1 level where everyone spawns with a rocket launcher, and the spawn point is on a building full of explosives.\n- Try to walk down the corridor when suddenly another player "accidentally" fires a rocket and destroys the whole building, which kills everyone on the server and forces a map restart.\n- Spend the next 10 minutes trying to get to the end of the corridor; within 20 seconds of spawning someone "accidentally" fires a rocket again or walks into a tripmine, restarting the map. Every. Time.\n-Quit and join another server\n\n-Join a game where the world is made of tetris-like blocks\n-Frantic action - interesting jumping/platforming and lots of enemies to kill. Sometimes I don't know where I'm going or if I'm even helping, but can't get too lost (can always die & respawn at checkpoint) and soon understand the game.

It was around before Steam was even a thing.  If you like Half-Life then you'll enjoy Sven-Coop.  The best part is you can play with other people.  You can play some of it singleplayer but I recommend joining a friend or playing on a server because some maps are very hard and near impossible playing solo.  The graphics, gameplay and maps haven't changed from the early days.  I've noticed some tweaks but nothing major.  If you remember the weapons, NPC's, monsters from Half-Life...they're all here!\n\nPros:\nA great Half-Life classic\nClassic FPS gameplay\nMultiplayer\nLots of maps\nCustomizations\n\nCons:\nFew crashes - Even though this old game works good on the new Windows OS I've found that when there's a lot of people in one server and a bunch of stuff is going on at once it sometimes crashes.\nCan't clip other players - If someone stands in your way (like a doorway) you can't move through them.  This can give trolls an opportunity to screw up your fun.\nVote popups - When someone calls a vote, a window pops up and you can't do anything until it's dismissed, bad during enemy encounters.\nNoobs - If you're a long-time veteran of this game the noobs and young gamers on here will give you a hard time.  I've learned to help them out after they've got mad and thow a fit.  I don't want to offend them with my years of experience.  This isn't Call of Duty.  Some maps take patients to get though.  The noobs just don't understand games like Sven-Coop.  I know this isn't a game issue, more of a player issue.  But this is the first time in recent years I've encountered noobs of this caliber.  There's still lots of good gamers though, so it's ok.","January 23","true","18.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's the first game I played where people in public servers communicated over voice. It's the first game I got a microphone for so that I could communicate too. It's the first game that I would ignore my parents at my bed time and stay up late to play.\n\nIt's a great mod, but for some reason I stopped bothering with it when HL2 came out and there were promises of all brand new mods. That was a mistake. Sven is still the experience it used to be, and it's even better now that it includes the HL campaign updated to minimize loading screens (level changes). This has enabled me to not only share the HL campaign with friends who have never experienced it, but to also play it with them!

After 17 years it's now on Steam and prettier than ever. The devs even got permission to throw in the original HL campaign for free, and you don't need to own the original game to play.\n\nJust keep in mind that the enemies in every map are tougher than in the vanilla game so hordes of cooperating players don't effortlessly mow them down...and remember that its community centers around a game that's not only pretty old, but considered pretty 'hardcore' as well.

Since then, it has always been a hit or, I should put it this way, a revolution of gaming. It has set the standard of gaming and shooters alike. However, there was one problem back then. Most computer games are designed for only one player, and multiplayer exists in terms of split-screen and turn taking. They require player 2 3 4 and other subsequent players to be there physcially. Online gaming exists only in the form of flash games on websites and yahoo! chess and stuffs. To be honest, online connection was never stable at that time, and you're pretty much done when your mom wished to make a call.\n\nThen came cable and ADSL, which allows internet speed to go up to 512kbps or 1Mbps at that point, which is fast enough for most games, such as counter-strike. Good enough at that time.\n\nOf course, most online shooters at that time (the pre-directx 8 era) are mainly team based and deathmatch games (team fortress classic and counter-strike are some examples), and little attention were paid to story-lines and co-operative plots when it comes to online multiplayer shooters. Most online multiplayer shooters are rounds and rounds of endless matches, of which some find them competitive while others feel that this type of gameplay can be rather mundane.\n\nThen comes Sven Co-op. The most intrinsic idea of this mod (it's not a game, technically speaking) is to allow the possibility of having a multi-player co-op gameplay for the multi-award winning Half-Life shooter. It was this simple, yet in revolutionary for the valve franchise back than as multiplayer and story-based shooters had never mixed.\n\nSoon enough, the community grew, and more players, custom maps and add-ons are added into the game. Sven coop has since been evolved and developed into a seperate branch of valve shooters - coop shooter - after gaining support and fame from half-life gamers. Till date, custom maps of all sorts, such as defense, maze and horde maps, can still be found lying around the corners of the internet.\n\nThat was more than a decade and a half ago. Today, we see Sven-Coop listed in our library again. Today, we celebrate this game which blended multiplayer and game plots together.

Well, If you haven't already seen it, It's all free, And now with this on Steam, You can play this even without Half Life, Because the devs are just that good, And for a mod thats 15 years old, They still release patches and updates to make this game/mod even better, It's just shows how much love went into Sven Co-op, Also with this mod comes already existing Half Life mods completely ported over such as "They Hunger" and "USS Darkstar", Which are already amazing but now they're on steam.

A game with 17 years of experience, is finally on Steam. And to tell you the absolute truth, I had never played it before it came on Steam.\n\nI knew what it was, but I’d never played it.\n\nBasically it’s Half-Life 1 Co-op\n\nBut here’s the thing. It’s amazing. But here’s the other thing. It’s not exactly what it sounds like. It sounds like Half-Life 1 optimized to play co-op of Half-Life 1. But that’s not what anyone does.\n\nMost people play custom, adventurey, often crazy maps, that have been incredibly well coded and made, which is still fun, but don’t expect anyone to play through the entire of Half-Life with you.\n\nAlso, another thing, I’m incredibly surprised they (Valve) include HL, HL:OF, HL:BS, and even HL: Uplink, a game that until now hasn’t been fully, officially released by Valve.\n\nRest of the review here[decbot.wordpress.com]\n\nI rate it:\n\n87.5%\n(Just so you know, Half-Life 1 would be around 95%)\n\nIt’s free.

I highly suggest you download this and play with your friends, or just join a public game, although those can get pretty crowded and confusing sometimes.\n\nI'm also very glad to see that Sven Co-op has been revived, since before the Steam release Sven was pretty much dead.","January 22","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"amazing". This mod is always what i've wanted. Especially after Synergy, I wanted to be able to play Half-Life, Half-Life: Opposing Force, and Half-Life: Blue Shift with friends, but I couldn't until now. Before the initial release of Sven Co-op, I had heard of it from some friends who highly reccommended it. I am glad I picked it up right as it came on Steam. Not only is it the best games of a generation from the late 90's, but added things to make the game more challenging, that including Survival gamemode, which is pretty hardcore, as when you die, you're done till your team makes it out of that particular part of the game. This is hands down the best Half-Life mod I have ever played. Download it now, it's great.","January 22","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The amount of custom maps I've seen for this game is incredible, there's just  so  much of them. I really like the concept of this game, if it wasn't a mod at the time I started playing this back in 2012, I'd probably have over 250 hours logged into it.\n\nAlong with all of that are the admin tools (If you're an admin), which can be a hell of a lot of fun. I just go on a Hamachi server with a friend and just screw around with these admin tools. It goes to spawning and shooting fireworks into the sky, playing music/sounds server-wide, turning off the lights, making the flashlight bigger/smaller, making the flashlight a different colour, and messing around with Entmod.\nThat stuff was in the mod version, but I've tested all of that with v5.0. The only thing that doesn't work in this version is Metamod (as stated by the developers).\n\nAll in all, the community of this game is going strong, the gameplay aspect of this game is very fun (It's co-op Half-Life, what's not fun about that?), and I'll most likely play 250 more hours of this in the future.","January 23","true","30.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now, I don't mind a bit of challenge, but at times it can get ridiculous. Enemies have ungodly amounts of health, and take forever to go down even with other people helping you out. The puzzles can range from tedious to downright confusing, and most of the maps contain gratuitous amounts of broken English. I'm not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on foreigners, I'm just saying it takes from the immersion a little bit.\n\nI'm glad this game finally got a proper Steam release, so hopefully the map-making community picks up a bit and maybe the problems I just mentioned will become a thing of the past, but even after playing for a bit, most of the problems are still there.\n\nIt's a good game to pass the time with some friends, but for a really good cooperative experience, this really wouldn't be my first choice.\n\n3 "Could-you-please-get-the-♥♥♥♥-out-of-the-way-so-I-can-advance-you-complete-♥♥♥♥ing-♥♥♥♥♥♥" McLovin's out 5","February 8","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jackandcak/recommended/225840/","Jackandcak","duit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jackandcak/","51 products in account","Half-Life has been out since 1997, the graphics were great for the time, the storyline, the puzzles, everything. It brings a good gameplay experience, in my opinion one of my favourite games ever, I grew up with it when I played it for the first time since I was around 3. Sven Co-op Is the greatest and the best mod for this game, not only can you play online with your friends and play through the whole game, you can download or make your own custom maps and experience them, best of all, It's FREE! No DLC, No Micro-transactions and no Expansion packs (You can still get Opposing-Force and Blue-Shift for their campaigns). Not only that but this mod adds a lot new content as in: weapons, maps, enemies, playermodels, and lots of stuff to mess around with. Ignore the negative reviews because it's just people whining about the graphics or that they can't solve a simple puzzle and have to look it up (because they have tiny brains and are inpatient). Load the game up and make a server. If making a dedicated or port forwarded server is too difficult or complicated for you, just download a program like LogMeInHamachi or Evolve and set up a private server where you can easily connect to eachother.\n\nI rate it 10/10 - There are secret Chumtoads around the maps, also fun to find.\n\n\nOh and you can donate over 5 or 8$ to the creator of this mod for 2-3 donor features :)","January 24","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jimgrimm/recommended/225840/","jimgrimm","JimGrimm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jimgrimm/","151 products in account","After over a decade of development, Sven Co-op launches on steam with a generous amount of well developed maps and fun gameplay. I only hope that we get regular updates that add more maps to keep the game alive. My favorite so far was "Danger of Collaps" or sc_doc. It offered action as well as puzzle solving which is sadly absent from most others. You'll find a variety of maps/gamemodes similar to that of Left 4 Dead. Not really a problem but It's much more satisfying to get on a server and work as a team to solve puzzles, you know, use your mind a little bit. Again I haven't played all the maps but the running theme is kill mindless zombies/aliens/soliders until you reach the next room. One downside is the lack of official servers. I know they're a modding group and don't focus on servers but the only "official ones" I found were the "Nightfire source" servers which are probably not related to Sven and I found them dreadfully laggy. I don't want to see this game one day have one or 2 servers up like some other source mods. I know the devs are VERY devoted but it's such a relief to be able to play this game with people who may have never downloaded the mod before.\n\nOverall: Really fun and free to play. Only improvement i could think of is some official servers of some kind.","January 25","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With no freemium purchases or microtransactions, you get the whole package in this bundle.\n\nMods are built into Sven Co-op to allow Roleplays, Labyrinths, Quests and much, much more on multiple servers. With Sven Co-op having a proactive community and the ability to make a standard Half-Life Vanilla server yourself, one can not get bored. I would recommend inviting all of your friends who love the Half Life series over to Sven and playing on your own server with them, nothing as hectic as 'partially' co-ordinated strikes against zombies, whilst only having crowbars. The interesting bit behind Sven Co-op however is the customization, with you able to change the colour of your 'avatar', which ranges from the models Sven Co-op has, the female versions of Gordon, Gordon himself, Barney, alternative skins, a Jill Valentine 'Half Life' style skin, Robots, Marines [Including Shephard from Opposing Force] and even Ivan the Space Biker! [The original Gordon].\nWith Sven Co-op allowing you to download extras, such as the campaigns for Blue Shift and Opposing Force respectively, you will not feel a sense of repetition in the campaign and when you're all done, you can go back to the Mod-built servers.\n\nOverall Sven Co-op I recommend for anybody who wants a pure free-to-play game, wants to reminisce the old days of gaming or has wanted Half Life [1] to be Co-op. There is something in Sven to please everyone, ignore the negatives that people say, it is as easy to leave a server or mute the players and proceed on. The positives are only found by actually searching, I was unlucky as I automatically connected to a Russian Mod/RP Server, where everyone was screaming Russian over the microphone. I simply disconnected and joined a Vanilla server manually, from there on, it was easy going.\n\nOn a rating of 1 to 10, I would give Sven Co-op a 9.5/10, as it is the best it can be, the only downsides are.. You guessed it! The lack of 'Instructions' when you start up the game and the small amount of 'bugs' that are present, but are generally NOT gamebraking: I do not play this on a 'Gaming Rig', I play this on my Laptop and this game runs very smoothly for a £200 Laptop. With the developers quite pro-active themselves, the bugs are not around for quite long before they get patched.\n\nSven Co-op in my eyes, is one of the best mods on the Half Life series and does not require anything at all, not even the base game to play. I would recommend this to anyone who asks me about Sven Co-op.","May 4","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can also play on the expansion packs of Half Life and even play on User and Custom made maps/campaigns, one of the best demonstrations of these custom made campaigns is a really old mod named They Hunger. There are a few gamemodes to play on (example: one game mode has a more realistic aproach and when you die, you don't respawn).

Essentially Half Life levels modded to have co-op functionality, as well as custom levels created by the development team and the community. Playing Half Life 1 with friends is pretty enjoyable, but I think it's the faster paced custom levels that really shine. Well known favorites like the cartoonish Toon World return, plus some really wacky ones like this one map having me play in an RTS-like mode, commanding other players. There are team based competitions, puzzle solving adventures, tricky platforming levels, and more generic massive warfare shoot 'em ups. It's so fun to see what map is loading next, I honestly almost never know what to expect. ♥♥♥♥, this game is cool.\n\nWhy are there even negative recommendations? I'm sorry that this free game that's usually a nearly two decade old engine looks and plays somewhat ugly? The game is based off of Half Life 1, so there's no reason to think the game will look modern in any way, but the gameplay fun more than makes up for it. This game really takes me back, and I'm certain that you'd have a good time blasting vortigaunts with friends and strangers alike. Some of my most memorable, "formative" gaming years were over 10 years ago just running with groups of strangers opening fire on giant enemies in tandem while playing earlier versions of this mod, and I'm so glad it's back.\n\nIf you've never played Sven Co-op, you're missing out on a world of wacky fun.","January 22","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That means some maps CANNOT be completed without a friend (for example 2 buttons need to be pushed at the same time or someone boosts someone else to reach an area and open a door for him). Gameplay is SUPERB. It feels like half life. So the game mechanics are the same. What about multiplayer? So there are some new aspects. Many maps allow respawn if you die which is good. Some maps wont allow that though which means that if you die your friend will have to revive you.Speaking of friends, you have to rely heavly on him as well as him on you. Teamwork is essential. You should heal your friend and vice versa since many maps dont have many medical items. The maps differ from each other. Although most of them are objective based there a few which are survival based and most of maps differ from eachother with different desing and objectives. Now here is the bad part. Since the game is free to play and runs well even on PCs made after the 20s (which may be a good thing for some of yall) it means that many people who decide to ruin the game experience for the others are frequent. Lag is terrible on public servers,people dont communicate with eachother and dont teamwork at all and just "troll". To get the most out of this masterpiece you MUST play with people you know like your friends,your brother or sister,mom,dad,your dog etc. As long as yall communicate with eachother you will be able to team work with each other. And after you finish a hard puzzle you will feel a great satisfaction. I just started playing the steam version but since 2003 i must have put many hours into this game. One last thing before i conclude my review. This game supports many players in one server but i say less is better. I suggest 2-3 players because that way you can manage ammo better,communicate with eachother better and effectively and do puzzles faster. I played this game only with my brother up to this day and managed to finish almost every map. But that depends on you. If you want to play for fun and have a good laugh go ahead and invite as many friends as you like but if you play competitively and serious i suggest to keep a low number of players. The verdict is a solid 10/10, a masterpiece. This mod was created in 1999 and still holds up to this day.If you didnt play it back in the day i suggest you do it now! This is a must have in your steam library and is guaranteed to give you countless hours of fun. I have a great respects for the team who created this mod. Great job guys!","May 16","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seropohanian/recommended/225840/","seropohanian","SeropOhanian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seropohanian/","182 products in account","The basic information about this game:Name: Sven Co-op\nPublished and released by: Sven Co-op Team\nDate of release: 19 January 1999\n\nGameplay:Sven Co-op is a very nice game for everyone who likes the Half-Life series. It is a standalone game, but with the maps of Half-Life. You can just do the maps of Half-Life with your friends! They have every map of it, but not only that, you can play it with gun mods, character mods, and much, much more! You will find it out when you play this great game! It will begin with the classic begin in the train, that is bringing you (and eventually a friend or more friends if you play with them) to the Black Mesa Facility in Mexico. You start without any weapon or something, you have just to go walk and explore the building and talk to professors, and they can told you where you have to go, or what you have to do. You can also do funny things like if you go to a place that looks like a kitchen you are able to break stuff like a magnetron, or you can start the alarm, and much, much more things like that. Let's continue: You are walking and talking, but you have to go to a place where you can find H.E.V suits and a professor that is saying to you that you have to grab a H.E.V Suit (a suit that you have for giving you more protection) And now the real work begins! You have to grab the old good crowbar and you have to escape the Black Mesa Facility… The graphics of this game are low, but that is logic, because this game was made in the 90's. The sound and battle sound is very similar to a situation, every situation has it’s own sound, and the music is very logical with the game, so that is good. Also don't forget to bash the crates! :) Note: I could told a bit more about the game, but then I was maybe spoiling...\n\nConclusion:My conclusion about this game is that the game is well structured & organized, some weapons aren’t modded enough, sometimes the game can crash or freeze. Other than these small issues the game is also full of Easter eggs, secrets and other similar stuff. The replay value is decent, you will sometimes play a single level multiple times. I'll give this game a rating of 9,25 /10! Cuz this is literary one of my best games that I have, so that's why. Well, this was my review about this very awesome game! I hope you enjoyed reading this!","May 13","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ga-luigi/recommended/225840/","ga-luigi","GA. Luigi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ga-luigi/","46 products in account","I love the Half-Life series. A lot. It's my favorite FPS series of all-time, right after Doom. I think it's pretty awesome that Sven Co-Op is on Steam now. I mean damn, we've been waiting for it to happen for a while now. That being said, there is a couple of things I'd like to say about this game. Firstly, why did the developers feel the need to slow down the running speed and get rid of bunny hopping? That was a very important factor in Half-Life. That's like taking away text from RPG games. You just can't do that. Secondly, was this an excuse to make the game free? I know all games that are free are usually free for a reason (*cough* Nexon Zombies *cough*) and those reasons usually being mechanic changes or something that downgrades it. No fast running is a perfect example. It's also kind of like the Alienware Alpha. It's an affordable gaming PC, which is cool, but what Dell doesn't tell you is that is has a piece of crap hard drive that breaks down in a year. Now all that aside, I love that this is on Steam now, and it's a lot of fun to play with friends. I also really love the new textures and weapons. Therefore, I rate this mod 7.5/10, just because it's not what it originally was -- a co-op mod for Half-Life; nothing more, nothing less.","February 13","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thanks, Valve.\n\nA 17 year old mod still holds up in 2016.

You always feel like you're playing a new map.\n+ Constantly updated.\n+ Highly detailed weapons instead of plain low-poly weapons HL1 had.\n+ Fully supported third-person mode.\n+ Bots are usually smart, reactive, and actually take cover.\nThere's very few cons:\n\n- Mouse sensitivity is awful. Change it when you start up.\n- No custom sprays\n- Hearing people constantly spam "MEDIC!" and "TAKE COVER" can be annoying.\n- Enemies can sometimes be unreasonably hard.\nSven-Coop redefines how well the GoldSrc Engine was back in the late 90's, and now you can test it with no cost! It does not matter if you're new to the Half-Life series, or a hardcore player, Sven-Coop let's you relieve your nostalgic times or even introduces you to the series, while being able to do it with friends.\n","February 22","true","19.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I had some afraids about that if Sven Co-op could be a "game" rather than "mod" as it been before. But It failed not.\nAnglescript (modders and mappers cannot be stopped now), improved stability (one of the most important), new features, models, maps and much more! This game is everything, each map have it's own unique gameplay and atmosphere! Amount of custom content is incredible, and now with steam release new modders and mappers could bring massive amount of custom content for players. Sven Co-op is perfect no matter if you looking for adventure or action, want to assault spaceship full of aliens, play Half Life Campaing with friends or just have calm adventure game in acient temple- everything is possible with this game, see by yourself (do not be afraid of downloading custom maps from http://scmapdb.com). Good for two-four players for lan games, as well as for 10 or even 30 players in dedicated server to play with. Even for singleplayer experience- why not (items are now kept on map change). The amount of new features the Sven Co-op team was able to add into this Half Life engine in past 17 years is incredible and impossible to be described here, so there is nothing left than download and play Sven Co-op for FREE, without any games needed!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoevenreadsthis/recommended/225840/","whoevenreadsthis","[mR]Danp1970","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoevenreadsthis/","83 products in account","I played this when Steam first came out. My god, that was so long ago. In combination with Steam's launch populartizing HL1, so was Sven Coop. And it was really fun to play.\n\nAnd quite a bit has changed, considerably.\n\nPros:\nIt's Half Life One, They hunger and several other mod campaigns merged into one, all of wich can be completed in single player (if you're really good at the game, most maps are forgiving though)\n\nThe playermodel selection is vast. From the HECU to being Boba Fett, you have a really nice selection of models to choose from.\n\nPlayer colors, albeit limited, do exist. However, no neutral colors exist so no black/gray/white which kills off a lot of cool color combos.\n\nIt's free with no microtransactions and it never will have any.\n\nIf you own Opposing Force and Blue Shift, you can use the files in the svencoop folder to mount them on. And it does it flawlessly.\n\nNew HD (I mean REALLY HD) models, the look is extremely improved in comparison from the originals in 1999 and in 2004. You can chose between Software and OpenGL renders.\n\nHeavily Optimized. Even if you own a potato, it will probably run about 30FPS on the highest possible settings.\n\nUp to 32 players to go on a total massive rampage through various maps.\n\nVoteban/Votekick/Votemap/Votemute to deal with trolls, squeakers, the average internet warrior in general.\n\nDevelopers that actually care. Previously, I had joke that in the past 12 years I played this, they never added the Baclava HECU as a playermodel. They did in the first update shortly after the game came out (whether or not it is coincidental is beyond me but thanks anyway Sven Devs!)\n\nLess than 1 GB in size yet it packs a huge amount of content.\n\nCons:\n\nLike most gold source games, there's an Alias system. Which means you can use spoof names and freely troll and cause probelms and no one will know who you actually are on steam.\n\nPeople can colide with one another, which can cause problems in terms of blocking doorways or breaking passages (that's what votekills is for though)\n\nThe Color system doesn't factor in White/Gray/Black, so the you're stuck with Red,Orange,Yellow,Green,Blue, Indigo, Violet and whatever colors are inbetween these.\n\nAll in all, it's an excellent game, most of the cons on based on opinion anyway. It's a good game to gather friends, and have a good time all in all. And it's easily playable by anyone, even if you own a rusty toaster. So Go ahead and download this game, have a blast!","January 22","true","10.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.","May 11","true","3.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","3","5","4","0"

Two other long awaited additions (to me at least) is the fact if you're playing a campaign split into multiple maps such as Toonrun or Half-Life and you survive the previous map your guns carry over and aswell as this regular enemies drop their weapons when you kill them if the map supports it, the only campagin that i know supports this at the time of review is the regular Half-Life campaign, no doubt more maps will be edited with this feature in the future.\n\nLet's focus on the edited version of the Half-Life campaign and the new "classic" and "survival" modes for now. Classic mode restores the weapon's atributes to what they were in the game, such as the shotgun having a duel shot instead of being fully automatic for it's alt fire and in survival mode you don't respawn, although there are respawn tokens that look like a floating lamba symbol that revive everyone that's dead although you can revive people not long after they die if they haven't been gibbed. The only campaign i know that supports this at the time of writing this review is the original Half-Life campaign and they've handled it very well, alot of the maps have been edited togeather so there are fewer maps overall and if there's a section which prevents people from going back or creates a barrier it teleports everyone to that stage such as the lift towards the beginning of the Half-Life campaign which you have headcrabs coming down at you and there's a grinder at the bottom of the shaft.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Half-Life universe, including the Portal games or just a general Valve fan i reccomend giving this mod a go especially as it's one of the best mods based on a Valve game out there (imo) and it's free aswell as standalone.","January 24","true","19.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Kill them with your arsenal, all that jazz! Not much to say about it. The weapon variety is pretty fantastic, along with the models of the weapons. Pistols, shotgun, SMG, and your trusty Rocket Launcher! Can't forget the alien weapons though, like the Snarks or the Shock Roach. If you really like crowds of people supporting you to take down the big bosses or huge waves of enemies, I'm sure you'll enjoy the gameplay to Sven Co-Op then. However, if the map is too small & the player amount is godlike huge, then there will surely be too much bumping into other players!\n\nSoundtrack:\nCan't really say much on the soundtrack, as most of the songs are ripped from the Half-life 1 Soundtrack. But that's besides the point, the main theme song is pretty retro. Or was at-least, until the 5.0 update remixed it. Otherwise it's good if you love the any Half Life 1 track out there.\n\nGraphics/Visuals:\nObviously the graphics aren't too great due to it being made with GoldSrc (also known as Goldsource). They reworked all the Half Life 1 weapons so it has a great re-work to it. However, there is one con to the Shotgun animation actually. Sometimes if you fire too fast, the shotgun pushes back too far & goes off to the right of the screen.\n\nStory:\nWhile it has it's no  real story to it - It has it's own campaign/maps if that supports my statement. It's loads of fun, pretty much have to find out why you're there, what's going on, then stopping the problem head on by taking it to their world!\n\nConclusion:\nTake the game as you want, I suppose. I just absolutely love it so much! I've been playing it for the longest time, is all. Very good experiences with this game as well.\n\n10/10. ♥","January 22","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sven Co-op runs on the Half Life 1 engine, modified over the past 10+ (!) years. The maps all vary, from realistic scenarios and maps set in Persia, to wacky colorful hjinks in a cartoon land called Toonrun, but the goal is the same: 2 to 16 players (Varies per server, can certainly go higher than this) all come together as a co-operative team to wage war against AI of all shapes and sizes across countless maps made by fans of, and talented devs behind, Sven. It's free, it's amazing, and it oozes quality and endless entertainment from every kilobyte that the game is comprised of.\n\nIf you enjoy first person shooters, this is a mandatory download.","January 30","true","13.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Two other long awaited additions (to me at least) is the fact if you're playing a campaign split into multiple maps such as Toonrun or Half-Life and you survive the previous map your guns carry over and aswell as this regular enemies drop their weapons when you kill them if the map supports it, the only campagin that i know supports this at the time of review is the regular Half-Life campaign, no doubt more maps will be edited with this feature in the future.\n\nLet's focus on the edited version of the Half-Life campaign and the new "classic" and "survival" modes for now. Classic mode restores the weapon's atributes to what they were in the game, such as the shotgun having a duel shot instead of being fully automatic for it's alt fire and in survival mode you don't respawn, although there are respawn tokens that look like a floating lamba symbol that revive everyone that's dead although you can revive people not long after they die if they haven't been gibbed. The only campaign i know that supports this at the time of writing this review is the original Half-Life campaign and they've handled it very well, alot of the maps have been edited togeather so there are fewer maps overall and if there's a section which prevents people from going back or creates a barrier it teleports everyone to that stage such as the lift towards the beginning of the Half-Life campaign which you have headcrabs coming down at you and there's a grinder at the bottom of the shaft.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Half-Life universe, including the Portal games or just a general Valve fan i reccomend giving this mod a go especially as it's one of the best mods based on a Valve game out there (imo) and it's free aswell as standalone.","January 24","true","19.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You do not need Half Life 1. Just get it RIGHT NOW. DO IT! JUST DO IT! DON'T LET YOU DREAMS BE DREAMS. JUST DO IT!\n\nWell I'll describe this game as I played it first. Then list some key points. Yeah. That should work.\n\nAnyway. I started the game off absolutely sure I would be useless. I immediately get in there and help out my team in unexpected ways. Everyone has a medkit to heal their teammates so you can immediately become useful.\n\nWhen I first started the game I found two nice players who greeted me right off the bat. Then I started solving some puzzles. I was amazed at myself. My 6 or so teammates seemed baffled by them yet I figured it out myself. So thats when I realized nobody is truely 100% useless(Unless you try to be useless)\n\nWe ended up after beating a mission having a monster battle. The enemy team only had about 3-4 headcrabs. We had 3 bullsquids and a human grunt. Needless to say the enemy team got slaughtered. There was another funny mini game we played later on as well.\n\nSo what do I think as key points?\n\nPros\n-Well done and seems pretty solid as a idea.\n-You can change your player model and many other neat settings you would not expect with the c key.\n-Pretty smooth. In every way.\n-Nice community. I don't know if I went to the right place but honestly everyone seemed nice and helpful. What a great bunch of players!\n\nThe In Between (Both help and hurt the gameplay)\n-Puzzles can be very easy or very difficult. This could make you laugh in some cases or rage in others. If you want a challenge this is good.\n-Enemies can be hillariously easy to kill or impossible depending on what your playing. This can lead to some rather unbalanced scenarios. Fun if you like chaos.\n-It can be very silly on some missions. You can FEEL the unofficial on a lot of them. Honestly I think it is pretty amazing in many cases. You get to experience some intresting fights and situations you never would otherwise.\n\nCon\n-If your a graphics freak you will be annoyed probably. I really don't see this as a big issue. The pros make up for this easily.\n\nI really can't think of another con honestly. Most of them are in between and not completely a con. Honestly I think I should just call the inbetween section pros anyway.\n\nGet this. It is worth it.","April 15","true","11.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I have not been here since the beginning or 3.0, 4.5 being my first version, so I may not have the right to say this. But let me just get to the point: I love this game. It is geniunely one of my all time favorite games, and I as a nerd played a bunch of games. I still think this game is great to today. I still play it alot. I have thousands of hours in the 4.x mod versions. And I think so far that 5.0 is great too. I even have my own dedicated server still up.\n\nBut, it saddens me to say that the developers or atleast a few of them have lost their mind.  I'm not gonna write a giant ♥♥♥ rant about this because you came here to read a review about the game, not some stupid nerd whine about a problem you don't care about, but yes. Sniper has lost his damn mind.\n\n\n\nPros:\n- Great and addictive coop gameplay that seemingly never gets old to play with friends.\n- Over 936 maps as of this review to playthrough.\n- Aton of great addons you can customize your server with it to your liking.\n- Ton's of stuff you can edit to your liking, such as sounds and player models, weapon models and more.\n- Very easy to get a public or private server up and running.\n- Hundreds of servers up as of this review.\n\nCons:\n- Developers are a bit crazy right now.\n- While I personally don't have a problem with this, some might be turned off by the Goldsrc engine's limits and graphics.\n","June 5","true","60.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Unfortunately, it is plagued by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ map design by people who literally think a 4000 hp Vortagore spawning RIGHT NEXT to the player's spawn along with about 20 heavy grunts is "balanced".\n\nSven Co-op is a multiplayer mod for Half Life where players work together to accomplish an objective set by the map. While this is great and all, there are a few killer flaws...\n\n- This is the GoldSRC engine. Meaning lag compensation isn't a thing. If your ping is in triple digits, don't even bother.\n- FastDL is still in its infancy, making it a ♥♥♥♥♥ to host custom maps.\n- Nobody in my region plays this game, except for 12vies that don't know how to bhop or kids that grief and say "go play single player" no ♥♥♥♥ off go kill yourself instead.\n- Unbalanced maps: The mappers believe that to balance a map for co-op multiplayer, you should just spike the HP of all enemies and increase their quantity. Also give them OP weapons. I just spent the last 30 minutes being spawncamped by half a dozen heavy grunts, along with an RPG and a 4000hp Vortagore out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere. And this is a stock map too.\n- Voting menu is finicky, doesn't always show all players.\n\nLong story short, if you have 4 or 5 friends you'd like to play this with,  and they all live in the same region as you... GREAT! Otherwise, don't even install this game.","May 11","false","33.7"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","1"

If you want to play as the original difficulty, well, the difficulty that Sven Co-op has is more harder called Survival Mode. And the worst thing is, that you cant disable it\n\n2.If you played the original Half-Life, you can see that you can kill your allies (Scientists, Security Guards) well, in this game you cant kill them... and thats bad because if for example: you cant find a weapon and your only alternative is to kill the Security guard, well in this game... you just have to adapt to your current weapons...\n\n3.Also this game has more bugs than the original (For a strange reason i lost my pistol and my crowbar... i only had a healthkit)\n\nMy recommendations are: Play the original Half-Life game and uninstall this game for better experience.","April 29","false","3.9"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","3","14","0","0"

I started up the game and it froze on the starting menu. I had to restart my laptop, and try again. When I opened steam to try to start the game, it was already running. I never started it. I opened task manager and tried to close out of it. It would exit. I can't even delete the game and download it again because I can't delete a game that is running. I have restarted my computer, sometimes even running virus scanners, and I get a different problem each time. Once, no icons on my desktop or on my taskbar showed up. Every two times I click, with a cooldown of about five seconds, the screen would flash black. Now, I am having to deal with the fact that I cant change the brightness on my laptop. And when I try to click the buttons on the side of my laptop to change the volume, which is an HP Pavillion x360, I can't see what im changing it to. So now, it is forever running on my laptop and I will later try to slowly delete each file of this game, but I don't think it will work. I'm not lying so I can hate on this. I'm just upset that I cannot play it.","February 6","false","24.4"," 4 of 23 people (17%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","17","4","23","5","5"

Awesome!\nBut the people at Sven have done things (or haven't done things) that pretty much completely ruin the experience.\n\n1. Spawn points\nIn the old version of sven, there would be a map change every 5 minutes.\nNow though, they've added a much longer distance between the spawn points meaning if you die right near the end, you have to run through the entire level just so you can cover 1/12th of ground which isn't easy cause...\n\n2. Mandatory Survival mode\nYes, they have decided to make Half-Life a competetive game. So if you are playing with your friend and you die, the whole game restarts. Though there is a temporary fix for turning off this "feature" (type in console: as_command survival_enabled0) constantly typing it in every single level just chips off a little bit more from the actual core experience of playing Half-Life but with other people.\n\n3. Elevators\nI've noticed a bug that no one really talks about inwhich if you stay on the elevator to the end of it's moving animation without jumping, you will be unable to move and the only "temporary fix" is to type "Kill" in the commands and respawn 50 miles back at the start of the level.\n\nSo with those 3 things combined I gotta say this game is pretty dog ♥♥♥♥. I could spend hours making threads and ♥♥♥♥ dedicated to fixing this stuff but I would much rather just play the original Half-Life in my library.\n\ngg","February 16","false","16.5"," 4 of 23 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","4","23","2","5"

No matter what, elevators will either snare you and prevent you from being able to move at all, and you'll be lucky to break free...or they'll randomly kill you and your crew.\n\nUntil the elevators are fixed, you're going to find it near impossible to continue without having to fully restart or typing the kill command into the console in the hopes someone will find a respawn token for you to come back into the game.","February 26","false","6.8"," 4 of 23 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","4","23","0","0"
