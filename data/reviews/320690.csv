"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pi142/recommended/320690/","Pi142","Pi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pi142/","393 products in account","Good game.  Five tombs.   8 chests each with four or five point objectives per chest.  Play match 3 to cause the chests to open when you meet predefined point totals and collect all the medals from the chest.  This part has a really nice balance to it.   You're not guaranteed at any point to achieve the points and get a medal but neither is it so hard to achieve as to be frustrating.\n\nThere are in game achievements.  A few of them lack balance.   For example to get the bronze medal for destroying the tokens requires 100,000.   I played the entire game thru once and only got to 66000 whereas "total points" across all chests has a gold level of 100 million which is achievable by end of 4th tomb on first play through.  In other words to achieve gold on all achievements you'd have to play thru the game about 10 times because of the one archievement, whereas most of the others you'll have gold by one play thru.  Beyond that nuissance the game is enjoyable.\n\nWell worth a couple of bucks.\n\nAs a bonus the cards that drop tend to sell for about 25-30 cents a piece (at least they did when I bought the game).\n\n","January 4, 2015","true","11.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The tile layout is random, and you have no control over what tokens drop, and no time to spend planning strategy, as each level is over in one minute, so your score for each level is largely a matter of luck. But you have to reach a certain high score in order to progress, and by the time you get to level 3-5 or thereabouts, you're only getting that score once in every ten or fifteen games. So you need to play each level over and over and over and over again waiting for the lucky break that will allow you to progress. It's a shame that the progression system is so crappy, because the game itself is fun -- but going back for to the same level for the fifteenth or twentieth time to try and get lucky is just a pain.","October 24, 2014","false","20.6"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","6","19","0","0"
