SHOCK TROOPERS.\n\nThis is an arcade masterpiece from the 90s. A game I played in my childhood and burned more quarters than I care to admit.\n\nSHOCK TROOPERS puts you in the shoes of one (or three) of a multinational team of absolute badasses who are fighting some very generic bad guys (called the Blood Scorpions) in three different mission paths. Of course, you won't get an amazing story here, nor will you see much of it as this is formerly an arcade game and quite a quarter eater at it.\n\nThe game handles just as well as it did almost 20 years ago and is just as fun as a result. As a top down view, 8 direction shooter, it's a very simple game from simpler times. There honestly isn't much to say about the game aside from it's very simple and very fun as a result.\n\n8 dollars for this game is practically a steal. If you're not versed in these games, you can easily spend twice as much on this quarter eater in an arcade.\n\nOn top of that, it's a great game to run solo, couch co-op. or online co-op. Which means you can bring a friend along to your destructive shenanigans against the Blood Scorpions.\n\nAll in all, SHOCK TROOPERS is a refreshing blast from the past in an era where creativity seems to be either stunted or moving incredibly fast.\n\nAfter beating the game, you can also ask yourself why a group called the "Bloody Scorpions" is led by a man that looks like a lion.\n\nThis has been a Robot Maid Review. Thank you for reading.","May 23","true","3.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Until multiplayer is fixed properly I have to change my review from thumbs up to thumbs down.\n\nSo to summarize, single player original game is solid. Multiplayer is a somewhat unplayable mess at times coming from myself and another who tested the online coop on all three main routes. I wouldn't recommend buying until they fix it with another update.","May 18","false","7.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"
