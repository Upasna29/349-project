"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/220860/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","Imagine a puzzle game where logic is thrown out fo the window, and absurdity is rewarded - that's McPixel.\n\nMcPixel, the 'hero', is faced with various different scenarios where he is tasked with saving the day, often from a bomb. There's only one way to save the day in each scenario, but it'll often take trial and error to discover it. It often won't make sense, but it will more often than not be absurd and strangely funny.\n\nThe McPixel website describes it best "You have 20 seconds to solve each riddle, regardless whether you lose or fail, you will be transported to next puzzle that you haven't solved yet."\n\nWhile it might take several attempts (and in some cases a lot of click and hope) to discover the correct way to solve the puzzle, the game rewards you, and in some ways encourages you to find all the different endings to each scenario. If you find them all you unlock the an extra round of scenarios in each level.\n\nThe game is entirely based around using the mouse, and clicking on the various objects within a scenario to trigger the outcome. There's little more to it than that, so in a stragne way it would make a great iOS game and I think I would have enjoyed it in a more casual pick up and play basis in 10 minute bursts.\nHaving said that I did stomach it enough to sit through it all and finish the game within 2 hours, and then attempt the 'Free DLC'.\nThere's plenty of pop culture references and humour to keep you engaged if you're something of a 'nerd' (I know I found them entertaining). However, the game becomes slightly derailed towards the end with just how unlogical and absurd the puzzles become. In some cases there's no real way of discovering how to save the world without a good old fashioned hopeless clicking everywhere on the screen frezy.\n\nI enjoyed it for the crazy nature of the game, however the soundtrack might just put some people off as there's only really one track that repeats throughout the game. In short, a crazy puzzle game that might not be for everyone depending on your absurdity threshold. I'll recommend it as I enjoyed it, but I can see why some people might not. Not for everyone.\n\nProbably best to check out the free demo available on the website: http://mcpixel.net/ or on Steam.","July 31, 2014","true","6.5"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","51","57","0","2"

Everything seems like a good idea.\n\nThe wild gameplay, that awards not only the correct solutions but also failed attempts, requires a great deal of creativity. Creativity - not just random clicking on every single pixel on your screeen, as many have pointed out in their reviews. After a time, the game begins to draw you towards its twisted logic. The bumpy run you had the first time playing McPixel, turns out to be very addictive, definately re-playable and captivating long ride.\n\nThe humour used by the creators is a little bit foul, sure. You will feel it pays tribute to your inner 14-year-old. It fits, however, the randomness and roughness of the game, making you smirk at the most obscure gags. (And is still better than American Pie.) What is even more exciting, the game has been provided with themed levels, for example paying tribute to other famous video games.\n\nAlso, lots of explosions.","February 22, 2015","true","1.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","20","22","10","0"

It is not at all a serious game and it’s very likely that 95% of the time you will blow something up on your first try. But it’s still fun none the less and the level comes back around faster than you can even think about it. It has a somewhat crude but hilarious sense of humour, with very bizarre gags in each stage.\nThere was quite a few times during my time playing that I just thought, “Who the hell would do that?” and had a little chuckle to myself.  But there you go, that is the magic and charm of McPixel.\nThe music is extremely repetitive, but strangely enough it isn’t annoying. It’s more catchy then annoying.\nThe main game is pretty short and there is a load of free DLC for you to play afterwards if you want to. (So there are a lot of days to save!)\nIf you were to play this nonstop the whole thing would probably take you a few hours, and it’s probably a good idea to take breaks due to its fast paced nature.\n\nGenerally I really enjoyed it; I thought it was pretty fun; there are a lot of references and things to have a laugh at in this game. So it’s something fun to throw on when you are bored.","November 27, 2013","true","3.8"," 40 of 61 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","40","61","0","0"

A parody of MacGyver and other unrealistic action heroes, the game has you defuse the danger in various scenarios by, well, clicking on everything on screen in hopes to find the order that works. And that's where McPixel falls short, there is no gameplay, per se. There is no internal logic to decipher, nothing to understand. Click a character or set piece. If nothing happens (that's good), click another one. If ♥♥♥♥ blows up, start over with a new order of clicking-on-things.

To break it down for you, its a point and click puzzle game set in brief different scenarios, such as in a falling elevator, you need to analyze how to save the day. You have  an emergency button, elevator buttons, an old man, a bell hop and an extinguisher. What do you do to save the day? These are wacky and weird situations, usually involving bombs or gasoline. None of which lasts no longer than 15 seconds. The game is broken up into 4 chapters, each chapter has 3 or so clusters of 6 scenarios / challenges. If you fail doing a challenge, you don't do it over and over until you get it right, you just go to the next uncompleted scenario.\n\nI completed the entire first chapter in about 15 minutes, which is 18 challenges? There is free DLC, which is a series of selectable clusters made by fans or whomever. There is a lot of content here, but the real catch is the challenges just don't last a long time. They're pretty easy to figure out.\n\nThe cherry on top of this is that there are some laugh out loud results. Maybe the results are so LOL because they're so unexpectedly random. Again, I expected nothing from this game and got a lot of entertainment from it. I'll be returning to the game to see the other quirky scenarios with crude graphics.","June 27, 2013","true","1.3"," 36 of 57 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","36","57","0","0"

The fact that this game is frankly too silly for even the immature likes of me seems to bear this out.  That, and the fact that while I was fine with all the post, and indeed post-post, and probably even post-post-post, and maybe, just maybe, even all the post-post-post-post-modernist humour that has emerged during my lifetime, all this post-post-post-post-post-modernist humour that seems all the rage these days is just a bit beyond me, I'm afraid.  Half the time, not only did I not find the "gags" of this game all that funny, but at least another quarter of the time I didn't even understand what had just transpired (though the insanely, even downright PERVERSELY pixelated nature of events may not have helped in these instances).  The other quarter of the time, okay, I got myself a cheap chuckle - my personal favourite was trying to work out who the virgin was to throw in the volcano, and ultimately (and successfully) deciding on MYSELF - but the laughs really are too few and far between to put up with the eye-bleedingly awful graphics and incredibly limited gameplay.  (Groovy music, though.)\n\nLook, I will recommend it, but only just, and only to those who need a brief break from watching allegedly "funny ♥♥♥♥" all day, every day on ♥♥♥♥ing YOUTUBE.

If you fail, you have to do the other levels in the chapter first. At the end of the chapter, the game lets you retry the failed levels, until you completed them all. Then you proceed to the next chapter. You have to memorize the things you have already tried, so you can try something different the next time you play that level. There are some silly and amusing jokes here and there but in the end I didn't really enjoy this game that much. I just got bored fast. At least on PC. I think this game is much more suitable for mobile platforms, to play in short bursts, to kill some time with. And guess what... McPixel is actually available on mobile platforms! You can buy the game for Android and iPhone. I wish Steam would offer an option to review a game with a sort of neutral verdict. Because as a mobile game, I would actually say yes. But this is Steam and we are reviewing Steam games here.

Developer Sos has proven this hypothesis false, with a game that is undoubtedly bad, but ultimately endearing. With its artistically inept graphics, nauseating music loop, shoddy game play, and abundant toilet humour, it should not be possible to enjoy McPixel, and yet I found myself, like many others, actually having fun playing this mess.

The graphics are intentionally (I think?) super crude, and the interactions between you (McPixel) and world objects are surreal and unpredictable, which gives the game its charm and character.  The game wisely advises you to play it in short sittings and take breaks.  Indeed, I found if I played more than one set of levels at a time the humor would kind of wear off, and since this game relies entirely on its humor, it stopped being fun very quickly.  But then when I played it the next day it'd be fresh again.  Some drawbacks: The music is repetitive; the graphics are overly crude, so much so that you can't always tell a clickable object exists; there's no achievements (I'm a little OCD so I like achievements).  I think it's a little pricey at $5, but I bought it on sale so I think it was definitely worth whatever it was I paid.  All in all, it's a quirky, silly game that  changes the entire genre  will put a smile on your face.","February 3, 2014","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The strangest thing is that it works quite well either as a good bad game or just as a clever indie puzzle– with an excellent length/price ratio thanks to the continuous release of free new levels.\n\nLong version:McPixel is the kind of game that you can hardly place anywhere. On one hand it’s obviously a joke title, full of obscene and sometimes downright retarded gags, completely illogical puzzles and an utterly insane basic idea: you have to defuse bombs at unusual places (including a lot of video game or movie themed levels) using the most absurd ways.\n\nStill, despite the complete absence of logic, it works surprisingly well as a puzzle game, and the incentives to find all possible solutions can open up a few clever visual gags that really show how great imagination the creator has. It may not be a new Portal in terms of advancing puzzle games to the next level, but it offers a quick fun, and thanks to the many levels– including the free DLCs and community-created ones– it can last quite long, if you choose to stick with it.","February 2, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Well, you get McPixel, a game that isn’t afraid to throw logic out the window and give some straightforward jokes.\n\nMcPixel is a game that can be described as “WarioWare meets point and click adventure”. Each scene has a 20 second timer, with McPixel trying to save the day, often by disarming a bomb. Actions range from moving, picking up objects, and interacting with objects. Given the short time limit to solve the situation, players will tend to combine as many objects as possible. The game’s crazy logic behind the puzzles don’t tend to make sense and often the solutions are found by trial and error, though there are some more sane solutions that can be found. Solving each scene is simple, but the gameplay assists in something bigger, which is the game content itself.\n\nIn this game, McPixel must save the day. How he does so depends on the scene and the criteria for doing so is often stretched. Throughout the game, various gags are presented, often with random and crazy ideas. Often some gross out humor is applied, so be aware of the random jokes and occasional bodily functions. Along with these kinds of gags, many pop culture references are in the game, especially with TV and video games. These references I feel tend to work better at giving a good laugh, though the various random occurrences that don’t reference anything also are worth a laugh. Anyway, the bulk of the game is in its humor, and McPixel has no shortage of comedy to toss around and make you laugh.\n\nOn a short note, the game applies a retro style with its art and music. The game is pixelated like an old game, though McPixel does employ a consistent and certain character style. Scenery tends to be pixel art as well, or in some cases pixelated versions of photographs. Animations are crucial to delivering the game’s gags, and the crazy qualities of them work fine with the retro style. Music is the same way as well, using some chiptunes for some nice fat beats. There are not many songs and the tracks are quite short, but it does achieve the retro style with some neat chiptunes.\n\nMcPixel is a game for those looking to laugh at the absurd and crazy situations and interactions. Gameplay is kept simple to focus on delivering comedy, though the game’s crazy logic can make some puzzles confusing and require trial and error. Still, with some retro styling with the art and music mimicking old video games, McPixel makes for a game to laugh at some silly things.","March 14","true","4.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","1"

It is basically a point and click game. The aim of the game is to locate and destroy/get rid of a bomb by clicking on objects on the screen. There are several stages which each has several levels.\n\nThe good points are that you get lots of levels (100) which you can happily sink alot of time in.\n\n\nNow for the bad points. First off, although the game tries to be humorous by having you embarass or do terrible things to the characters in the game, some of the actions that the main character does may be offend/disturb people (e.g. peeing on an alien). Second is that when you start the game there is literally no tutorial which was somewhat frustrating trying to figure out what to do. Third issue is that when you fail to locate the bomb, you will proceed to the next level. The game then goes through all five levels of the stage untill you have disarmed the bomb in each stage. This forces you to remember exactly which items not to click on, but the main problem is that it is somewhat difficult to find which items can be interacted with. Fourth issue is that the game is extremely repetitive. Once you finished the first level, all the other levels are exactly the same except with new scenery. Fifth issue is that the music is really annoying as it plays 1 track for the ENTIRE game.\n\nIf you like point and click games, avoid this game. If you like a fun and enjoyable games, avoid this game. It isn't even worth $1 let alone $5.","November 25, 2013","false","2.3"," 38 of 75 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","38","75","0","0"

When you click something wrong, the game makes a lot of random and funny events, that can make you have a fun time while playing.\n\nThere is really no storry in the game, and you have no charecters to really follow, other then of couse McPixel, but it`s not like the charecter in any way progress or learn something, it`s just disarm a bomb move on to the next level.\n\nEventhough there is a lot of levels in the game, the game is rather short, and can be completed really really fast. To get a 100% in all levels, you have to activate every single event on a level, and therefore not disarm the bombs a lot of the time.\n\nThe levels are random at times, but some of them are themed after moveis and game, and it is funny to see, how this game, makes events out of the situations from moveis and games.\n\nLike DLC quest, I don`t think you should buy this, unless you can get it very very cheap. It`s not becouse the game isn`t fun, but becouse it is as short as it is. Whit that said I give this game a thumps up. 4 out of 10","April 25, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A parody, unto a parody of a parody in a parodying universe. Parodyception ladies and gentlemen.\n\nMcPixel is a very simple premise, find a way to stop a bomb from blowing up in less than twenty seconds. Sometimes it's easy, requiring one or two steps, but sometimes you'll wrack your brain trying to figure out what the hell to do.\n\nThe controls are point and click, no ifs ands or buts. I took this game down in little over two hours play-time on my tablet, and have since not touched it (with good reason). After beating all the levels, finding all the gags, and playing the bonus levels, there really isn't much to do, unless you're into custom player levels.\n\nAll the gags are cheesy, including having McPixel kick people, or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on something, humping a PS3... you get the idea. Honestly, while I got a laugh out of a few of them, most of the gags made me want to gag.\n\nAll in all, if you need to pass time, get this on Play Store, the App Store, or any mobile device, but not here. Play it though, at least once.","September 28, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

(My experience is based on the Android version) McPixel is a very stupid minigame-fest, where you must save the day by preventing a bomb from exploding in a variety of 20 scenarios. The idea is a sort of comedy based, retro-style take on MacGuyver, where you improvise a way to stop a bomb from exploding. This includes stuffing bombs into people, causing somebody to accidentally kick the bomb out, or straight up urniating on the bomb. The comedy overtly crude and immature, and probably the reason for it's popularity of "Let's Play" videos with the younger audience. There are a few moments of laughs for me, especially the "Insert Virigin" mission.\n\nIt's point and click adventure gameplay will unfairly throw people off - unlike most adventure games where you may find yourself stuck without a guide, this is the only adventure point and click I know of where there is a constant failure state built in either the 20 second time limit of each level or in your inability to find the right answer. Plus, the extreme simplicity of the controls where you can either click to interact or swipe/right click to skip removes unnecessary complexity from the genre. Yes, it's a tad annoying to fail, but it's over quickly and since you can only click on so few things, you will eventually find the answer. This alone makes this game worth playing or at least checking out to people with huge backlogs - the game is very short (3-5hrs) and it means you can play the game, even mindlessly and be able to finish without scratching your head very often (there are a couple head scratchers though).\n\nThere are no sound effects in the entire game beyond the title screen. It's strange how a game about explosions only uses it in the title screen versus the rest of the game. It could have been a conscious decision to let the zany, silly chiptune style music make the situation seem crazy, lazy game design, or possibly both. The biggest legimate annoyance is the humor of the game ♥♥♥♥ jokes, dry humping, crotch kicks - it all sounds like something written by a pre-teen and it will definitely annoy some people. Another very annoying aspect is having to replay level to "find all the gags" in every level before you can reach the ending. This may offer some entertainment to players that enjoy this comedy, but for everybody else, it's an unnecessary grind, which is accentuated in the irritatingly boring, and unnecessary "click everything and hope for the best" last level. Still, I'd say the $5 price tag matches the value of the game, though I'm glad I got this in a bundle which made it really cheap - I could say I wasted my time with this game, but I played it on my phone while there was down time at work - wasting time was the whole point.\n\nBy the way, I'd argue this game is better in short bursts on a mobile device than sitting down and playng on PC. The only reason why I have 10 hours logged was to farm trading cards - I wouldn't have installed it otherwise.","October 24, 2013","true","10.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When you click something wrong, the game makes a lot of random and funny events, that can make you have a fun time while playing.\n\nThere is really no storry in the game, and you have no charecters to really follow, other then of couse McPixel, but it`s not like the charecter in any way progress or learn something, it`s just disarm a bomb move on to the next level.\n\nEventhough there is a lot of levels in the game, the game is rather short, and can be completed really really fast. To get a 100% in all levels, you have to activate every single event on a level, and therefore not disarm the bombs a lot of the time.\n\nThe levels are random at times, but some of them are themed after moveis and game, and it is funny to see, how this game, makes events out of the situations from moveis and games.\n\nLike DLC quest, I don`t think you should buy this, unless you can get it very very cheap. It`s not becouse the game isn`t fun, but becouse it is as short as it is.

If you make the wrong choice, you fail that scenario.  But don't worry, you will fail many scenarios, as the correct path is hardly ever the most obvious.  And that's the charm of the game.  You essentially try these situations over and over, and you'll finally realize that you aren't supposed to pick up the dynamite you're supposed to kick the guy in his genitals (duh!)\n\nThis game reeks of potty humor, and slapstick comedy, and I find it hilarious!\n\nFor the steam sale price, it's definitely worth picking up.","January 2, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As random as the game seems, there's some sort of weird, reverse anti-backwards logic that keeps multiple levels of using guess and check on a bunch of random game elements fun and satisfying. It has the feeling of being what a point and click adventure game would be like if instead of saying "I can't do that" every time you rubbed two random, unrelated objects together, your character did whatever dumb thing came to mind first with them. With the ability to also create your own simplistic levels with some patience and frame by frame animating, you can pretty much make any of your gleeful childish jokes and obscure references a reality. Although McPixel isn't for everyone, give it a go if you still have the mindset to enjoy immature humor.","February 28, 2014","true","39.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Everything is controlled with one mouse button and that's where it's charm lies. To use or pick up an item you just press it. And hope for the best. Sometimes pressing something (or someone) will pick that thing or even a person up to use with other items. In other cases, pressing will lead to McPixel kicking the said item or person. Usually that kick will result in everything blowing up.\nSometimes the solution is to press on the fire to take your pants off and take a ♥♥♥♥, saving everyone's life. Pressing the fire in the next puzzle will make McPixel jump to the fire, combusting himself. In the third puzzle, pressing the bomb will make McPixel kick it, destroying half the city. The solutions range from simply press the fire extinguisher to extinguish bomb to kick a fat naked guy in the showers, so that he would slip on the soap and land on a bomb, defusing it.\nEvery single solutions is stupid, yet brilliant at the same time.\nIt also offers FREE DLC, a thing that you wouldn't get in a 60$ "realistic millitary shooter".

The logic of defusing the bomb rarely makes sense, but that was probably a part of the failed attempt at humor in this game. You die a lot as a result of this and also because most actions kill you instantly. This was extremely frustrating at first, but after discovering I could skip the tediously long cut scenes at the start and end of each location, the game was no longer tedious, boring, and frustrating, but only tedious and boring!  The fun of Kicking people in the groin or peeing on them wears off after the first level.\n\nI feel like it’s inappropriate to review a game you spent only an hour playing, but I just have no desire to return to the game right now.\n\nIf you’re a fan of tedious shallow gameplay or lackluster humor, then you might enjoy this game.\n","December 14, 2013","false","1.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmast98/recommended/220860/","tmast98","Tmast98","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmast98/","135 products in account","McPixel is a point and click game adventure game.  Although enjoying very few point-and-click games, I was willing to give a chance to.  In the end, I did not find myself having a fun experience.\n\nThe game is meant to be a comedy of sorts, having both slapstick and crass humor.  Although some of the gags are good, the logic behind solving the puzzles is convoluted and confusing, sometimes having no logic at all.  This results in you usually having to just use trial and error over and over to figure out the right order of operations to solve a level.  This is made somewhat less annoying, however, as the load times between failed attempts is very quick.  In my opinion, the gameplay would better fit a more narrative driven game than a rapid-paced puzzle game.\n\nThe other problem I had with the game was the music.  Throughout the entire game, only one very repetitive music track is used.  At least as far as I got, there is no sound effects, ambient noises, voice acting, etc.  This means the one looping music track is the only thing you will hear throughout the entire session.\n\nAlthough I did not find the game fun, players who enjoy "rage games" would probably get a few good laughs out of the game.  I would recommend waiting for a sale however, as there is not much gameplay for a $5.00, compared to other games on Steam for the same (or lower) price.","August 12, 2015","false","1.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The campaign was really really really fun and i enjoyed it very much. The DLC had some bad ones and olso had some good ones. The good ones were mostly userpacks and olso some other ones. But my nightmare was nerdpak what made me rage quit that piece of F**k 6 times. Olso i tried the fart along and even talked to another pixel guys and kicked they'r balls. Yep. This is a cool game but .. its kinda shot and only thing you can do after the campaign is do the endless mode. Thats it. I have all 100% and i really laughed at the ending clip.\n\n8/10 And i recommend this game. Ofcourse if you want a cheap game in your library.

But after 10 minutes of just random clicking, it starts to get frustratingly confusing. There is no real incentive to keep on playing - since after completing the various levels, you can go back and "fully complete" levels, by discovering all of the gags. Which really just gets tiresome.\nThere is a "social" (I use that term loosely) aspect of the game, where a bunch of people under the name of the main character just talk to each other.\n\nI think the most entertaining part of this game was the "Fart-A-Long". Although even then, there isn't much variety for it as I have played the same 3 patterns (if I recall correctly) numerous times.\n\nIs this title worth $5? No. I recieved this game for free, and only played it to retrieve the trading cards from it.\nBut hey, if you're feeling generous and want to have a handfull of amusing moments, then godspeed.\n\n2 out of 10 teardrops.\n\nTL;DR\nNo enticement towards replayability, "Social" part of game is just a less-populated version of Omegle, and humor dies out quickly.\nThere are more worthwhile games out there with quite a good incentive for replayability (even under $5.00).","February 2, 2014","false","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Not a real game just a good joke.\n\nEdit (to make it more helpful :)\nIt is something like point and click adventure, where you solve one screen puzzles. illogical puzzles. so You will click on everything interactive to see what will happen. Usually it will finish with huge explosion.\nTo make a progress (and see some new puzzles) you have to finish successfully some previous puzzles (well, I know its not a big surprise). So you will have to repeat puzzles and hunting for all interactive spots, what i found boring after few screens.\nI wanted to run through it like running though comic book at least, but it was not possible. i gave up.\nSome jokes are better some of them are worse. If you like jokes involving urinating or kicking someone's balls maybe you can find it funny.\nIf you are considering buying it you might rather watch some gameplay on internet,\nor try demo, you will see everything.

Or perhaps there's a better way to describe it other than that, but doing so involves runes and scripts and languages not spoken or written by any human society on this planet. Well you get the idea. It's weird.\n\nWhile the puzzles take either an insane person or complete moon logic to solve, they still are a humorous and overall enjoyable experience, and you're not overly penalized for making what would rightfully sound like the right decision (which sometimes is actually the right one just to mess with you), you just sort of keep going through the set of 20-second stages in each level until you get them all "correct". And even if it takes you only about an hour or two to complete the 4 chapters (which is highly probable), there's other challenges that involve performing the wrong (but funny) solutions to all the puzzles, and some bonus content and level editors and whatnot.\n\nThe humour involves quite a lot of pop culture references but it pulls them off quite well unlike every single other thing that makes excessive pop culture references (though I guess in this one they aren't quite as excessive). It also has some so-called adult themes like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or whatever, so if you're a kid or easily offended, you should probably go to bed or something.\n\nThe soundtrack (yes I will talk about this in every game I review) is mostly okay, maybe above average or so, it's free on the game's website so you might as well check it out (it's done in an 8-bit style like the rest of the game though with noticeable 16-bit instruments included). Why not?\n\nIt's not the game for people who are expecting anything resembling a serious experience, but for those of us who aren't, it's a good way to blow off some steam or whatever.","February 15, 2014","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even though for $.99 you get what you paid for.  Has some decent challenging levels and has its fun moments.  That being said, does it really need to pop out the title every time you win or lose a level and that happens every 30 seconds.  Even someone with advanced alzehimers wouldn't forget which game he was playing.  McPixel!\n\nI love pixelness but I am still wishing the pixelness was slightly clearer and that the music would vary more.  Also some of the level solutions are just SO dumb..like oh i have to pee in the ground first.  And for kicks, you can always kick someone in the balls.  There will be alot of kicking people in the balls and sexually pleasing animals. McPixel!","January 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

It's a simple mini-game based point & click adventure game, where each of the levels has 6 scenes, where in each one, you have to figure out within at least 15 seconds, to figure out how to disarm the bomb. (And sometimes, figure out WHERE THE BOMB EVEN IS!)\nThis game is a comedic game; nothing dirty, but rather AWKWARD; the main character is in fact, "McPixel"; a parody of two characters, named MacGyver, and his other parody character, named MacGruber. Each episode is simple; YOU HAVE TO STOP THE BOMB! (Or whatever disaster will happen.) Note that the main hero is not a very smart fellow, so you play as him, (and if lucky) figutre out how to stop a disaster from happening.\nSo, what makes this game so awesome?!? Dude; this game is so dang awkward, that it's funny! If you like a good laugh, and like good, simple "point & click adventure" style puzzle-based gameplay, (that will usually take at least a minute or two, just to solve the puzzles) this game is 100% guaranteed, for a good laugh! Among games that are categorized as "SteamPlay" games, all DLC for this game is FREE!\nDon't forget; ANYONE can even make their own levels, with the downloadable level editor, too; the official website has a tutorial page that will teach you how it works, because it doesn't require any professional programming knowledge; at least according to what it looks like, of course!","May 23, 2014","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With plenty of in-game levels and tons of free extra "DLC" to play, you can spend hours with this game. Many of the levels contain a lot of jokes and references to other games or movies, and most of the bonus levels (which you unlock by not only saving the day by defusing the bombs in every level of that chapter, but also going through and discovering all the gags that involve not saving the day) are straight up homages to those things. The video game one was my personal favorite, where you have to save Cloud and Sephiroth by becoming Jenova, and saving Chell from Portal by opening a portal into her body and tossing the bomb in it, etc. I found myself laughing audibly with some of the ridiculous scenes, such as McPixel choosing to dry hump various objects instead of defusing the bomb.\nThe game menu itself was a delight, each option you pick containing a humorous outcome. The music, though simple was actually quite addicting, and can easily get stuck in your head as it plays in the background of every level that you're trying desperately to defuse a random bomb in less than 20 seconds. Some of the levels were pretty easy, but I don't think the game itself was actually going for a difficulty factor as much as it was a gag factor, and sometimes when the outcome was easy, I actually found myself looking for the funny alternatives instead of defusing the bomb right away. The 8-bit artstylem though simple, actually was very good at depicting the various emotions of the characters, such as McPixel screaming at a soldier to remove the bomb after putting said soldier's own hat on.\nI'd definitely recommend this game if you could find it on a sale. As great and amusing as it was, it still only contains about 2 hours of actual gameplay, the rest stemming from DLC both made by the actual developers, and by the community itself via the in-game World Creator. Though than again the game only markets itself as $5, so if you've got a fiver to spend, and have a twisted sense of humor, I think you'd enjoy this game.","February 8, 2014","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a simple mini-game based point & click adventure game, where each of the levels has 6 scenes, where in each one, you have to figure out within at least 15 seconds, to figure out how to disarm the bomb. (And sometimes, figure out WHERE THE BOMB EVEN IS!)\nThis game is a comedic game; nothing dirty, but rather AWKWARD; the main character is in fact, "McPixel"; a parody of two characters, named MacGyver, and his other parody character, named MacGruber. Each episode is simple; YOU HAVE TO STOP THE BOMB! (Or whatever disaster will happen.) Note that the main hero is not a very smart fellow, so you play as him, (and if lucky) figutre out how to stop a disaster from happening.\nSo, what makes this game so awesome?!? Dude; this game is so dang awkward, that it's funny! If you like a good laugh, and like good, simple "point & click adventure" style puzzle-based gameplay, (that will usually take at least a minute or two, just to solve the puzzles) this game is 100% guaranteed, for a good laugh! Among games that are categorized as "SteamPlay" games, all DLC for this game is FREE!\nDon't forget; ANYONE can even make their own levels, with the downloadable level editor, too; the official website has a tutorial page that will teach you how it works, because it doesn't require any professional programming knowledge; at least according to what it looks like, of course!","May 23, 2014","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even though for $.99 you get what you paid for.  Has some decent challenging levels and has its fun moments.  That being said, does it really need to pop out the title every time you win or lose a level and that happens every 30 seconds.  Even someone with advanced alzehimers wouldn't forget which game he was playing.  McPixel!\n\nI love pixelness but I am still wishing the pixelness was slightly clearer and that the music would vary more.  Also some of the level solutions are just SO dumb..like oh i have to pee in the ground first.  And for kicks, you can always kick someone in the balls.  There will be alot of kicking people in the balls and sexually pleasing animals. McPixel!","January 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

It's a simple mini-game based point & click adventure game, where each of the levels has 6 scenes, where in each one, you have to figure out within at least 15 seconds, to figure out how to disarm the bomb. (And sometimes, figure out WHERE THE BOMB EVEN IS!)\nThis game is a comedic game; nothing dirty, but rather AWKWARD; the main character is in fact, "McPixel"; a parody of two characters, named MacGyver, and his other parody character, named MacGruber. Each episode is simple; YOU HAVE TO STOP THE BOMB! (Or whatever disaster will happen.) Note that the main hero is not a very smart fellow, so you play as him, (and if lucky) figutre out how to stop a disaster from happening.\nSo, what makes this game so awesome?!? Dude; this game is so dang awkward, that it's funny! If you like a good laugh, and like good, simple "point & click adventure" style puzzle-based gameplay, (that will usually take at least a minute or two, just to solve the puzzles) this game is 100% guaranteed, for a good laugh! Among games that are categorized as "SteamPlay" games, all DLC for this game is FREE!\nDon't forget; ANYONE can even make their own levels, with the downloadable level editor, too; the official website has a tutorial page that will teach you how it works, because it doesn't require any professional programming knowledge; at least according to what it looks like, of course!","May 23, 2014","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You're not likely to enjoy this game for long.  I read the reviews ahead of time stating that it's more of a joke than a game.\n"That's okay!" I thought. "Jokes are worth paying for!"  But that's if the joke is good.  Or meatier.  This is one juvenile gag repeated ad nauseam.  Occasionally, the combinations of selecting/kicking result in a good laugh (usually just a chuckle).  The rest...?  Do I enjoy sophomoric humor?  Probably more than I should, but c'mon.  Is there ANYTHING else besides kicking people in the testes and having everything blow up?  The free DLC is all the same.\n\nEven if you buy it on sale, run it in the background to get card drops and sell all of them, you won't break even.\n\nIn short, if you're really interested in this game, see if a friend has it already and play it for 10 minutes on their account.\nAnd maybe get really high before playing.

The retail version is basically the same with more levels. It's a very Warioware-like game. Every stage you get around 30 seconds to save the day (often by stopping a bomb explosion). While the odds of beating a stage the first time are low, there's usually less than 10 permutations you can do on any given stage, so you'll figure it out quickly.\n\nSimilar to Wizorb, perhaps its best feature is how inexpensive it is - under $1 on a sale. Even less than that if it's in a bundle.\n\nIf you decide to play and don't feel like reading instructions, just don't forget that SPACE lets you skip just about all animations/intros. It will make your gameplay experience a hundred times better.\n\nI finished most of the content, including seeing most of the gags, in about 3 hours. It was.. somewhat fun, I guess. Might have been better left as a Flash game. Still, I'll give it a 6.5 out of 10. Still recommended, but just barely, and only on a sale or in a bundle.

Its gameplay is very simplistic and at times kinda annoying. The scenarios and outcomes are immature and sophomoric. As you can see, there are a lot of reasons to not be interested in the game. With all that being said, I still enjoyed it. Yeah, it's all childish, but that doesn't stop it from being funny. It's also never "in your face" with its comedy. The comedy is presented deadpan, as if there's nothing funny or really out of the ordinary going on, which is the type of humor I love.\n\nWhether or not you'll enjoy McPixel really boils down to whether or not you're comfortable paying $1-5 for what is inherently a Newgrounds flash game.","December 3, 2013","true","17.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game seems to be mainly focused around humor and little logic to the puzzles that you have to think random. Sadly the humor hardly got to me... I did find myself stuck on a few levels as well, the Mortal Kombat stage and one of those stages at the end that have 2 parts to it.\n\nI'd wait till there's a sale for it at $1 (which is either Winter or Summer sale) as that's how it feels like to me... $5 is a bit much for me. I do wish there just wasn't one music being played throughout all the levels though... gets annoying quickly and sorta hurt my ears too after awhile. Also meant for replayability, but the humor is, as I said, rather dry for me.\n\nIt's still a good game and more for those that enjoy random moments that either make or don't make sense and get a kick out of it.","September 20, 2015","true","5.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But in reality it plays more like a "Hope I can glean a bit of the logic the developers used to figure out what the heck will happen when I click here!" After awhile you do pick up on what is more likely to happen but no real brain power is involved. I dislike strongly that there is either SOUND or NO SOUND option and have only ever opted to play it with no sound because hearing "MCPIXEL!" repeated over and over is less than desirable. It is literally a game of trial and error and then repeating to get bonuses. What you 'think' will happen almost never does and that can be entirely frustrating.\n\nWill you feel the same way? No idea but it wasn't my cup of tea.

But in reality it plays more like a "Hope I can glean a bit of the logic the developers used to figure out what the heck will happen when I click here!" After awhile you do pick up on what is more likely to happen but no real brain power is involved. I dislike strongly that there is either SOUND or NO SOUND option and have only ever opted to play it with no sound because hearing "MCPIXEL!" repeated over and over is less than desirable. It is literally a game of trial and error and then repeating to get bonuses. What you 'think' will happen almost never does and that can be entirely frustrating.\n\nWill you feel the same way? No idea but it wasn't my cup of tea.

Logically there might be a dozen ways to make a guard leave his post or to interact with a pump, but only one will be correct because of the artificial nature of the game.  A good point and click will keep this under control with reasonable puzzle solutions, while rewarding the player for their time and effort with humor, good music, an interesting story or other unique charm.  McPixel does none of this.  The music is short, repetitive, and not at all pleasing to listen to.  The puzzle solutions are arbitrary enough that all you can really do is click whatever is in the level until you manage to click the correct objects in the correct order.

I had fun for 30 minutes.\n\nMcPixel is a game that ultimately relies on you to understand the "Moon Logic" joke of older 90's point-and-click games, and turns that joke into its big running gag. I didn't have a problem with it. The game made me laugh quite a few times for the unusual, inappropriate things McPixel would do with specific objects.\n\nHowever, that's as far as the gameplay extends. Beyond the mission-by-mission sequence, there's really little else to the game. Click on stuff, find the gag, move on. It's little more than that. And it gets old once you've played these levels over and over, to the point where finding another nonsensical answer would release another groan I had inside me.\n\nIf you find this sort of humor funny, more power to you. If you find this gameplay as not monotonous, more power to you as well. For me, there's just very little to say about McPixel. It's short and funny, but not a very memorable or ultimately pleasant experience.","December 27, 2015","false","2.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Its main problem is also its core mechanic : the solution to its puzzle makes no sense.

It's a game that makes you feel smart for making decisions you would only think are logical if your having a bad trip.  but anyway gameplay.\n\nThis game is a fast pased point and click puzzle/problem solving game.  you have 20 seconds to figure solve the puzzle and/or (and I hope your not reading this in an airport) find the bomb.  The crazy and over the top solutions are fun to discover, but get old quick, and can feel like punishment for thinking logically.  Each episode like thing, has 6 stages that you must complete, and if you do fail one, you still get to try again once you've played every other stage in the cycle so it is at least easy for how ubsurd and difficult it is to beat each stage.\n\nThis game has a few good features to keep you entertained for a while.  The story mode is split into 4 chapters, each with 3 episodes, with 6 stages inside, which equals to 60 stages, nothing special, but with the amount of content inside some of those stages, there has been some hard work and thinking done.  You also unlock little mini-games as you beat each chapter.  They aren't anything note worthy, but that is a problem with this game.  It's to chaotic and crazy to remember any given part.  Finally there is endless mode, where you can play through each stage from the game, in one giant episode (not a great completion bonus but it's the best it's got).\n\nWARNING: Spoilers(?) ahead?\nThe only real thing that comes close to a story, is a cutscene that is unlocked once you beat the last chapter.  It has McPixel... I don't even really know what happens.\n\nFor how odd this game is, I enjoyed myself when playing it, but that doesn't excuse the parts of it that are bad (which is sadly a lot).  But seeing as this game did show some good at points, I think that I can safely call it the BEST WORST game ever.\nSo my rating for this game, is a VERY generis 4/10","February 16","false","1.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I didn't really get the humor, and that is definately what drives this game. Your goal is to stop a bomb hidden on the stage, so click on something and something will happen...maybe you'll win? I get the 80's TV trope of having mere seconds to stop a bomb being played out (and the name seems to be a "Macguyver" reference if I'm guessing right) but the humor fell flat for me. The game definately relies on a love of the absurd, and I could see it being a blast for some. If it's on sale or in a Humble Bundle, maybe give it a try if you are bored?","December 29, 2015","false","7.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Its a throw back game with clunky graphics and a repeating theme song that reminds me of Mario. Game play is simple point and click with limited choices.\n\nSo how is it so AWESOME! Might be my favorite game from the sale. The game is even better played with friends. Its not multiplayer. Have some friends gather around a pc or laptop, take turns guessing the actions, and then laugh out loud at each other.\n\nThis game will be a cult classic. Sooner or later some college kids will turn it into a drinking game and it will take off.\n\nI expected to not like the game, wanted to lurk for cards, and ended up LOVING IT!! It is not your typical game. I take it as a tongue in cheek game that does weird things. If you ever watched Perferct Hair Forever, and liked that show, you can love McPixel.\n\nBuy it.

Most of the puzzles make no sense at all, so the only option is to try everything until the level succeeds. The point of the game is that every interaction is completely unexpected and funny.\n\nThere are usually from 3 to 5 objects in one level and about one of them can be picked up and used for interacting with the rest of the objects. One or two interactions can take place on each level until you either win or lose it.\n\nA typical puzzle goes like this: you are in a plane with a nuclear bomb, a snake and a shovel. If you click the bomb, the snake tries to eat it but cannot, because it's too big. If you click the snake, it bites you and the bomb explodes meanwhile. The solution is to pick up the shovel and then click the bomb, at which point McPixel uses the shovel to shove the bomb down the snake's throat (if snakes can be said to have throats), and then the bomb safely explodes in the snake's belly.","July 23, 2013","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Sounds interesting? Guess again. Each stage has like a few scenarios where you need to randomly click on the screen to complete a series of action. The puzzle is completely nonsensical and logic does no apply in the solution. There are a couple of actions and reactions in 1 scenario but only 1 action works. Even if you successfully complete a scenario, you are still required to try out all possible actions in order to score a gold. When you play, you can select the stage but not the scenarios in the stage. You are only given a couple of second to perform 1 complete possible action with 1 outcome before the game automatically switches to the next scenarion. It will repeat itself until you complete all the scenarions before you can replay the stage again to get gold.\n\nThe sound and music system in this game is repetitive and dull. After a while, it really got to my nerve and I decide to play the game in silence.\n\nPersonally I think this game fits to be a easter egg in bigger games like GTA or Saints Row where you can engage an arcade machine to play.\n\nOh and if you are looking to collect the cards, they do drop but at a much slower rate. My first card drop was at the hour mark (approximately there). My total play time includes a couple of minutes fiddling the game and the remaining was to collect cards.\n\nThe only thing I liked about this game is that you can change your pixel display style which I think its quite artistic in a way.","January 4, 2015","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play a raving lunatic thrown into a variety of situations in which he must find a way to "Save the day!"\n\nThis can be achieved in various ways and usually involves some degree of bomb disposal.  Whether by snake insertion, hobo blockage, urination, or virgin sacrifice.\n\nThough I was initially turned off by the overused pixel art motif, and I figured the lowbrow humor would grow old after a bit, I'm actually pretty happy I picked this game up.  It's clever, can be played in short bursts, and never ceases to surprise me.\n\nWhile the "goal" of each level is to find the "correct" and often ridiculous solution to a given level, I actually have more fun finding all of the different incorrect solutions, which usually include their own gag of some sort.  Finding all of the solutions in a given level unlocks more content, which is delightful.\n\nThe secret levels unlocked after 3 correct solutions are perplexing and mysterious.\n\nA fun diversion, if nothing else.

You play a raving lunatic thrown into a variety of situations in which he must find a way to "Save the day!"\n\nThis can be achieved in various ways and usually involves some degree of bomb disposal.  Whether by snake insertion, hobo blockage, urination, or virgin sacrifice.\n\nThough I was initially turned off by the overused pixel art motif, and I figured the lowbrow humor would grow old after a bit, I'm actually pretty happy I picked this game up.  It's clever, can be played in short bursts, and never ceases to surprise me.\n\nWhile the "goal" of each level is to find the "correct" and often ridiculous solution to a given level, I actually have more fun finding all of the different incorrect solutions, which usually include their own gag of some sort.  Finding all of the solutions in a given level unlocks more content, which is delightful.\n\nThe secret levels unlocked after 3 correct solutions are perplexing and mysterious.\n\nA fun diversion, if nothing else.
