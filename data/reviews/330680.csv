My hope was basically for a Star Fox knockoff with better graphics.\n\nUnfortunately, what I got was a janky, poorly voice acted mess that runs far worse than a game of this grapical fidelity should.\n\nThe entire game is played on a flat plane. There is no 3-d movement or action. Ships turn very quickly. So quickly it's difficult to do fine maneuvers. Generally, this means that a dogfight consists of either a series of head-on passess, or flying behind a wiggling enemy fighter. It's incredibly hard to see where your shots are going. There's no sort of lead indicator, and your "Crosshairs" are basically useless. Your bullets are your best indicator, and even then, it's mostly "This is the general flightpath of the enemy ship, maybe he'll run into enough of them to die." I found one of the most effictive dogfighting techniques to be to sit still, and just point your gun at the incoming enemy fighters, as that's the only time they really flight striaght.\n\nThe campaign missions are frequently interrupted with poorly written cutscenes which basically consist of your ship hovering near other guy's ship. Then you skip them, and you're thrown against a timed wave of infinite enemy fighters. The voice acting comes in here, as the only things more repetitive than the sound of your guns constantly firing (there's barely any reason not to), and the music, are the death cries of enemy pilots. The frequent "Arghs!" and "Oh No!"s are delivered with the drama and gravitas of realizing you put slightly too much creamer in your coffee.\n\nI was hoping the arrival of capital ships on the playing field would make things more interesting. Unfortunately, rather than doing things like take out individual guns, or subsystems like engines, they're just another life & shield bar. Actually, the ones I fought were easier than the fighters, because they're so much larger and easier to hit.\n\nFinally, the options menus are limited. If you're in a mission they're limited to "Quit" or "Don't quit". Anything you change results in the game restarting. You can use a controller, but you get even less fine control. Sometimes the turn keys just plain didn't work, or your acceleration will get stuck on.\n\nI didn't have high hopes for this game, yet it still managed to dash them. For that, bravo.","November 23, 2014","false","1.1"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","23","32","2","0"

You can turn left or right or you can strafe left or right as well, to help dodge enemy fire.  You're not going to break your brain learning the controls (I have qualms with games that have overly complicated control schemes, so I like it when devs keep it simple).\n\nIn terms of combat, there is a lock on feature that is good for seeing how much shields and health an enemy has, as well as letting you fire homing missiles at your target.  Regular cannon fodder type enemies won't pose too much trouble to a decent pilot, but I ran across an ace pilot who almost beat me, who's flying reminded me a lot of how the pilots in Freelancer flew (basically right at you, guns blazing, turn about, then come right back at you again, guns going full).  It was a blast fighting that guy and while I'm glad not every fight is like him, it's good to have those guys around to give you something different from the rest of the fighters.  I also fought another guy who kept dropping mines out of his ship.  That guy wasn't as challenging as the ace, but I had to make sure I dodged the mines and such while still doing enough damage to stop the guy's ship.\n\nThe missions are fairly varied.  Go here, shoot this, protect that, stop that, etc.  There is some voice acting, but not a whole lot.  The stuff that is there has a certain charm to it (in a "it's not great, but that's what makes it good" vein).\n\nI'd also like to mention skirmish mode, which is basically the ship combat without the story, with the added mechanic of earning XP to upgrade shields, armor, energy, and your weapons.  You fight through a wave of enemies and at the end of each wave, you fight a boss.  It's a nifty little mode that I prefer over the story mode, due to the upgrade system.\n\nThe graphics are nice for the amount you're spending on the game.  They're not going to blow your socks off, but they're not unpleasant to look at, either.  Each ship has its own look and the planets look pretty good.\n\nTLDR/Conclusion-\n\nOverall, I'd say if you want a nice little game to mess around with for a few hours, pick this up.  My mantra is that I should get 1 hour of gameplay for every dollar I spent on a game and I can easily get 6 hours from this game (with most spent in Skirmish mode, since that is what I like the most).","November 24, 2014","true","3.9"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","16","22","2","0"

Played Skirmish through wave 11. There's no variety whatsoever. The same 2 ships come at you by the dozen forever. Fly in, shoot, turn away, circle back. Hundreds of them forever, no change. There is exactly 1 boss type who does the same tactic, but with more health. And sometimes a destroyer that sits motionless and fires at you. New enemies spawn randomly with no discernable entrance, fly faster than you, and peck at you forever.\n\nWhich... ok. But meanwhile you have 3 weapons. 3 total, ever. Except that you don't, because you only have 1 weapon that just comes in three colors. Upgrades increase the numeric damage, but make absolutely zero difference to tactics, feel of the guns, or appearance. Even equipping more than 2 of the guns doesn't affect the effects. You never look like you're shooting more than 2. Never faster, never bigger, never spreading, never splashing. Just pewpewpew at level 1 or level 15.\n\nHey, there are multiple ships though, right? Wrong. You can start in a 2-gun ship. You can unlock the 4-gun and 1-turrent ship. Then you can unlock the 6-gun and 2-turret ship. But since the guns cap at looking like 2 guns, the only difference is damage numbers, never the feel of power. And of course turning slower so your only option is sitting there, pointing at ships that are flying toward you, and shooting back as they come to you because there are a dozen at a time and they are all faster than you are.\n\nBut wait! There are three factions of ships to choose from! Military, Outlaw, and Consortium! At least there's some choice there, right? Wrong again. They are reskinned, but statistically identical. So... just like the weapons are color choice but substantially the same, likewise the ships look unique but aren't.\n\nSo turn, wait, shoot, turn, wait, shoot, upgrade, turn, wait, shoot. Half an hour later, you'll realize you haven't had any fun and uninstall.\n\nIt looks nice. But awful controls, terrible lack of variety, monotonous AI tactics, and god just so boring.","March 13, 2015","false","1.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I actually gave it a pretty high rating. Today I'm writing why this game isn't worth it. It's awfully strange, way back then I liked Solar Struggle, but now, I'm wondering if past me and current me played the same game.\n\nHmm. I suppose it's like this: When I originally reviewed Solar Struggle: Survival, I was comparing it to other games on the XBLIG service. XBLIG is home to many of the worst games of all time. Back then, if I happened upon something even half-way competent on that service, I'd probably say it was the greatest game since Super Mario Bros. 3. Solar Struggle is on Steam now, and...well....Steam is practically the inverse of XBLIG when it comes to quality gaming.\n\nOr maybe I simply had no idea what I was thinking when I reviewed Solar Struggle: Survival.\n\nIn any case, SS is a space-shooter. There is a campaign that runs the usual gamut of missions. Destroy this, escort that, protect these, and so on. The most exciting aspects are the lousy translation, and the crazy twist ending where the main character dies...of boredom. Okay I might be wrong about that last part, but can you blame me? The missions are bland, shooting enemy ships down is more annoying than entertaining, and there's absolutely no challenge. Normally I wouldn't kick free achievements out of bed, but even I have standards.\n\nThe Survival portion aka "the part of SS I originally reviewed" doesn't hold up at all. On the outset, everything sounds alright. There are a variety of ships to unlock, upgradeable weapons, and standard wave-based action. However, there's no real challenge. Every time you sit down to play this mode you're going to do two things: 1) Hold the A button and Right Trigger down and 2) Aim at whatever happens to fly in your line of sight. My first Survival play lasted over an hour and a half. Staying awake is the real struggle here. The second time around I chose a better ship, and dropped my time by about 30 minutes.\n\nIt isn't until around wave 20 that dying becomes a possibility. The enemies start drowning your ship in bullets, shield upgrades (which also act as repairs) become too costly, and your thrusters no longer function, because all your energy is spent on weapons. The problem is, this doesn't happen until an hour or so of straight play. I didn't get this far through some winning strategy and tons of practice. I held down a couple buttons and pointed my ship towards anything explosive. It's a wonder that I never caught this in my original review. Solar Struggle is shallow and dull, but it also expects players to drag more than 5 minutes of compelling entertainment out of it.\n\nThe worst part? There STILL isn't an option to turn off rumble.\nHonestly, I'm disappointed in myself, disappointed in the fact that I recommended this game in the first place.","February 6, 2015","false","4.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","6","12","2","0"

Yes, you heard that right... It looks 3D, but the game's actually 2D only. There is no "up/down", only left and right. You can turn, and you can "side strafe" (i.e. fly forward and sideways).\n\nWhat's more, the enemies move way too much for the weapons that you do have. You're almost always outnumbered and will score 10-30 kills per mission, but the enemies are twitchy and you'll need to hit them dozens of times to kill them. So you basically end up in the spray-and-pray mode as the "weak" guns you have is unlimited ammo and needs no cooldown. The big guns you have have limited shots, so you save those on really slow targets.\n\nThe controls barely make sense. Why have side strafe at all?\n\nThe cutscenes are just static text blocks, usually quite short.\n\nGraphics are below average, sound is below average.\n\nAll in all, this game feels like someone's garage project that barely makes sense and is worth maybe $1.00 USD.","February 21, 2015","false","6.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"
