See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Black Mesa is a first-person shooter game by the 'Black Mesa Modification Team' aka 'Crowbar Collective' serving as a total HD remake using the Source engine of Valve's critically acclaimed and award winning game Half-Life (1998). Although Black Mesa originally started out as a simple Half-Life 2 mod, it has since developed and evolved into its own standalone game.\n\nBlack Mesa still follows the original Half-Life 1 story (albeit with a few level redesigns) where the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist working for the Black Mesa Research Complex with a PhD in Theoretical Physics with an uncanny ability to wield human and alien military hardware. Follow him as he fights his way through the Black Mesa complex which is under siege from Alien invaders following an experiment gone horribly wrong and the military who's out to cover-up the incident.\n\nPROS:+ Immense Graphical Improvement from the original game, such as, but not limited to:\nHigh Resolution textures\nImproved particle effects\nImproved lighting effects\nGood gun models and textures\nGood animation quality\nGood character models+ Improved immersion and atmosphere that brings the Black Mesa Complex to life such as, but not limited to:\nNew NPC to Player dialogues and new NPC to NPC conversations\nDiverse NPC models including female scientist, guards and soldiers with varying uniforms and faces\nGreat sound effects\nRevamped voices of Marines and Aliens (Vortigaunt)+ Great voice acting\n+ The AI for Black Mesa Security Guards were significantly improved (they now have a better chance of survival than the Barney Calhoun clones from the original game.)..but... (See CON #6)\n+ Cool soundtrack that plays on specific levels and events\n+ The level redesigns opened several new small areas within the levels and chapters which encourages a bit of exploration\n+ Customization options for multiplayer characters\n+ Good game time (provided you're playing for immersion rather than a speed run)\n+ Free version (Legacy Version) of Black Mesa is still available for download[www.blackmesasource.com]\n+ Great over-all presentation\n+ Steam Workshop Support\n\nCONS:- Early Access (will remove after final release)\n- Half-Life 'Xen' chapters are still missing (will remove when its completed)\n- Longer than usual load times\n- Walk button is not functioning properly\n- Few minor graphical glitches (particularly, some blood stain on the hand and guns models don't disappear)\n- The Marines and Scientist AI needs improvement (The Scientist Escort AI runs into line of fire instead of taking cover; In some occasions the enemy AI just stand around like turrets.)\n- Some of the redesigned levels feels a bit shorter than the original versions. (To be more specific, 'Surface Tension' and 'On A Rail' chapters.\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME that does the legendary Half-Life franchise justice and Lord Gaben proud. Brought to us by a team of volunteer artists, coders and developers, Black Mesa proves that the formula of Half-Life can and will withstand the test of time.\n\nBoth fans of the old title and the next generation of gamers can once again visit the universe that revolutionized FPS gaming.\n\nWORTH IT?:I can easily RECOMMEND this game even at its full price of $19.99 (or your regional equivalent). Black Mesa provides at least 8-10 hours of game time with one playthrough and is highly satisfying to finish.\n\nA message from the devs to people who says “it's just a paid mod”: (This part is not necessary for the review)Originally posted by BMS | Hubicorn: Posted: 7 May @ 10:49pm\nxxx We originally started out as a Mod for Half Life 2, releasing the first half of our modification in 2012 for free. Since then, we have evolved into a full, standalone game on a new hybrid engine while making vast improvements to the single player campaign. We are no longer a modification. We entered Early Access to gain support and make the commitment to finishing up the entire single player campaign, while introducing a slew of new updates along the way. Such as day one Multiplayer, Workshop, and Steam integration support.\n\nWith this comes costs such as licenses, hardware, and servers, that without being fulfilled, we would have not been able to release our product to our lovely fans. We aimed for the lowest price possible for Early Access given these circumstances. I hope this insight helps you.\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Charles1982/recommended/362890/","Charles1982","Morbus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Charles1982/","798 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nForget about Half Life: Source - This remake is everything you will need!Note: This game is still in early access and not finished yet.\nHint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR section.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ REVIEW]▬▬▬▬●\nBlack Mesa is a fanbased remake about "Half Life 1", which was originaly made by ValvE. Planned and scripted from Crowbar Collective as a mod for Half Life 2 back in 2012, Black Mesa started to gain a huge fan base on modDB. Its highly detailed textures, revised graphics and new features gave the ageing rough gem a new cut and let the hearts from fans of this franchise leap of joy.\n\nOne year later Crowbar Collective got the opportunity to let the people decide on greenlight wether they would like to see this mod on steam or not. Much to the joy of everyone involved, Black Mesa was able to get so much support to finally find its way on steam. It turned out to be a standalone game with higher texture models as well as more features like a stunning multiplayer. On the 5th May of 2015 people were able to purchase Black Mesa at the steamstore in a still current Early Access, caused from the fact that this game isn't finished yet.\n\nHalf Life itself is all about Gordon Freeman. A scientist who works at the Black Mesa Facility. An experiment -which was already foredoomed to fail- went wrong and unknown speciments are starting to take over the facility. Freeman's mission now: to save the facility and probably the whole world. And so his journey through a horde of aliens as well as friends and foes begins. Will Freeman be able to fullfil this destiny or will mankind be doomed?\n\nAs already mentioned the graphics are stunning. The game itself runs on the well-known source engine but the many details, new animations and refurbished textures let the player re-experience the Half Life 1-world as never before. The uranium glows in toxic green, yellow-greenish goo and dark red blood sticks on Gordon Freeman's weapons and the radiation creates a sightable static; the developer haven't been stingy on the details for sure.\n\nNothing has changed gameplaywise, this will keep the nostalgia up.\n\nThe soundtracks of the game are really remarkable. Joel Nielsen composed every single soundtrack you are able to listen to on the official Black Mesa Website as well as in the game of course. According to his own website he started composing for Black Mesa in 2004. Since 2014 he works on the soundtracks for the last missing levels named "XEN".\n\nSadly, the multiplayer gets rarely visited. A shame, because even here the upgraded graphics and details find their use to fanmade maps. Anyway, give it a try after you finished the singleplayer, it is worth the time!\n\nTwo weak things I have to mention at the end of this review:\n\nFirstly, the rising difficulty curve. What starts as a cake walk for the player, ends in the middle of the game in a big carnage. Too many AIs will try to take down Freeman at once which ends not unusualy in a very frustrating death.\nSecondly, the AI of allies. Guards, as long as they follow you, mostly run brainless into enemies and autoturrets. If a door closes in front of them, they will unlikely try to open the door to follow you again. This leads to even more lonely walks together with many dead and trapped guards.\n\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nThis remake might be the best of this year. While reliving the nostalgia, I found so many new paths, items and details I never payed attention to in the original game. Since I bought it in the big winter sale, this gem has cost me around 10$, but reimagine the whole gameplay it would be worth every single penny.\nYet, the game isn't completely finished and you will encounter rough edges - but thats why it is still lingering in Early Access. Only 15% - according to the official Black Mesa Website - are missing, which includes also the levels of the XEN-world, so we can certainly look forward to the final sequences of this game.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ UPDATES]▬▬▬▬●\nOn the 22th of december 2015, punctually to the Christmas days, Crowbar Collective endowed us with free content called "Crossfire". This included the singleplayer levels "crossfire" plus alot of bug fixes and also changes in the multiplayer.\n\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Updated graphics, new animations, high-detailed textures\n[✔] Unchanged gameplay keeps the nostalgia up high\n[✔] Remarkable soundtracks\n[✔] New areas added within the known maps\n\n[✖] Dumb Ally-Ai\n[✖] Multiplayer nearly dead\n[✖] Harshly increasing Difficulty\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

(It's also on offer from various digital retailers, including Joel Nielsen's Bandcamp[joelnielsen.bandcamp.com] for loseless formats such as FLAC)\n\nIn addition, GAMEBANANA & ModDB still have the numerous community made addons for the mod such as the well received Black Mesa Animation Revamp (Whether they will arrive to the Steam Workshop is yet to be seen as of this review), so you have plenty of opportunity to freely see for yourself if Black Mesa is a game you wish to invest in during it's Early Access period.\n\n\nNow, The Game\nAfter receiving the still persisting development for just passed a decade and being one of the first titles to be given the Steam Greenlight, it's now finally here in an Early Access build. So the first question most would surely be asking is; "What's the difference between the mod release I can still get, and the Early Access build?"\n\nWell, this official press kit should enlighten you: http://www.blackmesagame.com/bms_presskit.pdf\n\nIf you can't view the contents of the link, I'll list it here for you:\n\nHeavily Updated Single-Player Experience\nThe Black Mesa single player experience has greatly improved from the mod release; new visuals, new voice over, updated gameplay encounters, stability changes and more. Xen is not part of the Steam release of Black Mesa, but will be included as a free update when it is ready\nBlack Mesa Multipayer\nFight with or against your friends, in two game modes across six iconic maps maps from the Half Life Deathmatch universe: Bounce, Gasworks, Lambdabunker, Stalkyard, Subtransit and Undertow\nCustom Modding Tools\nUse the same tools the developers used to create your own mods, modes and maps for Black Mesa & Black Mesa Multiplayer...\nFully Integrated Steam Workshop\n...and then share your work on the fully integrated Workshop!\nComplete Steam Integration\nCollect trading cards, backgrounds, emoticons, achievements, and everything else you would expect out of a Steam integrated game.\nIn summary, you're getting the same as the mod release now with online ready multiplayer, fully integrated Steam Workshop & other Steam specific features, with the addition of improvements in audio, visuals & game stability for single-player.\nWhat I can personally vouch for with my time with it is that the weapon audio has been given welcome improvement where needed & the animations have been drastically expanded upon, improved and/or even reworked (Especially the Crowbar), with initial pick-up animations for weapons that didn't have them and half-mag & full-mag reload animations too. And there are new voice actors whom have joined the existing cast, which fans of certain existing third-party Source games should recognise fondly.\n\nFor anyone that previously enjoyed the Black Mesa mod like myself or is keen to enjoy themselves another Half Life experience, this is extremely recommendable from myself. And with the benefit of having the free mod still available, you have the chance to evaluate for yourself if this is something you want to jump into during Early Access.","May 5, 2015","true","7.5"," 190 of 215 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","190","215","7","2"

The devs have not spared any effort to that end, either, as this game brings Black Mesa to life like never before. Everything seems to have been done right here, from the level recreation, gorgeous environments, sound design, and overall loyalty to the original game. All the dedication and hard work of the devs has created something that is truly worthy of Valve's legacy and the Half-Life franchise. Make no mistake - this is the way Half-Life was meant to be played.","May 7, 2015","true","13.1"," 135 of 146 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","135","146","3","0"

Black Mesa is challenging. Black Mesa is hard. Black Mesa will eat your soul, but not before making you die a couple hundred times in-game. Black Mesa will send you back a few years, and punch you back to reality just as you start begging for more.\n\nWhy don't we have a robot or something to push this sample into the core? This looks sort of dangerous.\n\nGordon Freeman\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Black Mesa.\n\nGameplayIt’s not possible to talk about Black Mesa and not mention Half-Life, but to be honest, other than the lambda symbol, and all the internet memes, I’ve no knowledge of any of the HL games, so it’s safe to say I’m part of the 0,1% that never played them.\nWhen I started my Black Mesa adventure, I wasn’t expecting top notch graphics, state of the art technology or anything alike, and that was a good thing, as I didn’t find those. What I did find was a great adventure, or, well, a great semi-adventure, as I was stopped by a “To be continued” screen, which left me wanting more, but not better. Why am I not wanting better, you may ask. The reason is quite simple actually. From shooting aliens, to killing headcrabs, to swimming in radioactive waste and even bombing a gigantic alien-octopus, there are very few things that can get better. And just when you think you’ve got it all under control, with all the overpowered weapons, it hits you, literally, and you’re back to square one, in a way.\nI like to think a good story can make up for most of the stuff, but there was nothing to make up for with Black Mesa.\nIf I loved this game without being a previous Half-Life admirer, I’d say it’s pretty safe to say everyone can, and will, find this game extremely entertaining.\n\n\nPros Great story;\nWhen compared to Half-Life games, there’s an obvious upgrade graphics wise;\nQuite a few weapons available to annihilate humans and aliens alike;\nChallenging, not only difficulty wise, but also with some, sort of, puzzles to solve;\nSimple UI;\nSome amazing screenshots can be obtained while playing;\nVery fun, very creepy, very entertaining, and even very scary at points;\nVarious options to customize your character in multiplayer mode;\nActive community and development team.\nConsidering it's an Early Access (EA) game, I've decided to add a "Neutral" category, for details I consider important, but not gamebreakers, and could easily improve the gameplay if attended.\n\nNeutral There are a few visual erros, nothing gamebreaking;\nUnfortunately I couldn’t play the multiplayer mode as much as the story mode, as it feels a bit dead.\nHardly anything in the "Cons" section.\n\nCons Loading screens are somewhat frequent, thus are annoying.\nVerdictI'd give it a 9/10, which will undoubtedly turn into a 10 by the end of the game’s development. I might even end up joining the Half-Life 3 hype bandwagon...\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.","August 7, 2015","true","22.2"," 147 of 164 people (90%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","90","147","164","23","11"

So, I decided to make a review about it instead of talking about it over and over. As usual, I'll talk first about the bad things, however there's not that many:\n\nFirst and foremost; the controversy. I've waited for a long time to buy it because I was seriously against what the devs did. You see, time ago, this was a Mod. For free. The Devs had not yet finished it, but left it there for people to test it out. When they did that, they promised that Black Mesa would NEVER cost money, as it was a mod they created with passion to revive a game they love. Well that's kind of bullsh#t because soon after the game arrived in Steam Greenlight, and after a few months it was released in Early Access, still unfinished, and FOR 20€. A lot of people did NOT take this lightly, as it was a God-damn lie which they tried to hide from the Internet. In the end, I waited long for a sale, and I got it on the Autumm sale of 2015.\n\nThe second bad point of the game, is that after so many years in development, it's still unfinished. From the start to the Lambda complex, you'll get to see an insanely beautifull recreation of Half-Life, to then get hit in the face with a "to be continued", as the Xen chapters have been in development for a ton of time. To this point it's still not there, but that's not the only thing missing, as there's also a lot of maps missing on the multiplayer. Crossfire, for example, has been my most favorite HL map ever. It's a chaotic mess that I love, and it's yet to be added (devs said it's the next map to arrive). The multiplayer is also kind of abandoned as I rarely found servers with people, although I won't blame the devs for that.\n\nThat being said, what we have left is a game so good, it almost looks like Valve made it. The engine has been pushed to it's limits, and it clearly shows. Textures, animations, models; they all look insanely beautiful. Infact, I've only found a few bugs so far, one of them with a strange hitbox of a door, and another about an elevator that gave me ammunition for no reason at all everytime I went into it. The only bug that really annoyed me was the Hive-gun not appearing on my first playthrough. It was nowhere to be found where it was on the original HL and original Black Mesa, and I couldn't find it anywhere else. I was never a fan of that gun, but it seems that it got buffed and wanted to give it a try...\n\nWeapons have been balanced and/or remade to keep them from over-shadowing others. They also can appear in different areas than in the original game (remember the guard you can safe from a zombie early on? He now lets you take a revolver instead of a shotgun, which appears much later on, when the military shows up). The game also gives you a fair amount of challenge along the game, just as it gives you a fair amount of health, armor and ammo pick ups. Exploration is important, as there are a lot of said pickup items hidden in hard to reach areas. NPC's are helpful on it's own, and also have more personality and character than in the original HL game. You actually feel like they are someone who also got screwed because of the aliens, people who are trying to survive as hard as you.\n\nIf you haven't yet (for some dumb reason) played the original Half-Life, I'm gonna tell you to play this instead. However, seeing as it's still unfinished, and the price they ask might be too high for some, you should seriously wait for a sale. 10€ would be a fair price, further down would be a must-have.\n\nOh and, nice job putting the damn hat at the beggining of the game. It's the Gnome Achievement from HL2EP2 all over again.","December 20, 2015","true","21.1"," 170 of 196 people (87%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","87","170","196","18","26"

So for those who want the short version:\n\nThis game is awesome, but I am disappointed of the progress made in development.  Still no Xen chapters since it has been on Steam. Buy it only if you feel like waiting for the game to be (possibly) finished.\n\n--------------------\n\nNow for the long version:\n\nThis game came out on Steam around May 7th, 2015 and was put in Early Access.  I bought the game May 17th, 2015.  Now,  I had played the game before it came onto Steam. The legacy version, that is the one.\n\nThe game was good fun and great memories came back to me.  Both versions felt the same to me at the time, but I figured we would be getting a finished game soon enough.  Oh, how I was wrong.\n\nAfter the game had gotten some fair updates, I picked up and played the game again through, and found that the diffculty has been tweaked.  Ammo still felt abit scarce.  Weapons didn't feel as effective either.  Other than this, I honestly couldn't tell anything was different.  Marines felt more like aimbots from a distance suddenly too.\n\nThere was still no Xen chapters either.  I updated my review sometime in November from 'Thumbs Up' to 'Thumbs Down' and simply couldn't recommend buying it.\n\nA December 2015 update was announced and I had to get hyped for it.  I mean, 6 months after it came to Steam.  Xen had to be finished and the game completed, right?\n\nDisappoint. Again.  Mostly some bugs fixed, and cosmetic changes, again. (This includes weapon models, sounds, etc.)  Still no Xen Chapters and the developers seem quiet about its progress.\n\nI notice quite a few updates to the Multiplayer, but I do not play it and I greatly feel like this feature shouldn't had been done until the Single Player game had actually been finished.  Maybe this is why Xen is taking so long to be given to us.  I do hope they redirect their focus to what is actually important.\n\n--------------------\n\nSo, that's it.  In conclusion,  I hope this review and rant was informative and I will keep on updating this to reflect what I see and believe to be the state of the game. The game is definitely a very good remake of Half-Life. I am just disappointed about its development progress and just cannot fully recommend in buying, unless it is on sale.","November 22, 2015","false","38.8"," 995 of 1,318 people (75%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","75","995","1","44","103"

Even though it's not finished yet, it offers multiplayer maps and most of the Half-Life levels remade - Just Xen levels are missing. The original great level design and gameplay is made by Valve, but the remake itself (onto the HL2 Source engine) is made pretty well except some smaller bugs.\n\nPros:- Well-made remake. Plays as great as the original Half-Life, this can bring more people to this classic game, since the old graphics may not be appealing to current gamer generation. All gameplay features remains the same.\n- Fun and challenging achievements. Don't expect achievements in "beat level X" style, you have to do crazy or hard stuff to get them.\n- Graphics. Developers squished Source engine pretty hard and it looks really nice for a HL2 mod, particle effects especially can make your FPS drop to really low values - don't expect it to run with same FPS as Half-Life 2.\n- Custom mods and Workshop support. So you can mod a mod.\n\nCons:- Not finished yet. We are missing final Xen levels.\n- Smaller bugs. It's not perfect but I've never met a bug that'd ruin my playthrough. Just expect visual bugs, mostly.\n- It's not free as it was originally promised. Well, things change, even fan-loving mod developers need a money for bread and milk.\n\nNote: I have not played the multiplayer part of the game so consider that my recommendation is based on my single player experience.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","December 31, 2015","true","16.7"," 124 of 140 people (89%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","89","124","140","10","2"

I've played every Half-Life game including the expansion packs for HL1, and while this game won't ever have the classic charm of the classic Half-Life, this HD port and it's creators exceeded my expectations for mod that seemed almost impossible to be true, I like HD overhauls of certain games, and the development team did very well with this, they deserve something for their hard work, and that's why I decided to buy this version, and needless to say, I wasn't expecting a more polished copy, so I was very happy and surprised from what I see in this version. I will describe below how this version is improved upon the original BMS to better help the reader decide if this is worth their buy or not.\n\n===NEW AND IMPROVED/THINGS I LIKED===\n-NOW HAS A WORKSHOP!!!!!! LET THE MODDING BEGIN!!!!\n\n-Many level designs and Architecture and scenarios are greatly improved from the original BMS, in general, I like them, and they provide a new experience for me and doesn't make me feel like I'm just playing Half-Life 1 in HD, it forces you to come up with new ideas and ways of approaching certain obstacles and enemies, while keeping level design feel more immersive and realistic, almost as if you could role-play, it's just great.\n\n-Sound Design Vastly Improved over BMS, many sounds have been refined a well as the adrenaline pumping soundtrack of this version, weapon sounds and NPC voices have also been slightly improved from what have seen so far, as well as level elements, and enemy idle sounds. A couple of examples would be the HEV suit with a new sound filter on the original voice making it feel more immersive and futuristic, fitting to the game very well, and other sound examples such as the guard post between the two doors leading to sector C, where the guard makes a comment on Gordon's ponytail removal, before his voice was heard as if he was next to you talking, and now he talks through a COM like filter while behind the window in the guard post, counting as a nice improved detail that even I missed to question in the original BMS.\n\n-Some Weapons have seen new and improved balancing, better animations, new models, and more immersive details\nwhile still keeping a balanced ammunition pool that's more realistic and adds more difficulty to the game. One example of a weapon overhaul would be the Glock-17 which now has a new model, scratched details to show wear and tear of being an old used gun, it's original functions from HL1 have returned, and normal fire shoots at the same speed as the original glock in Hl1, and has seen the return of it's famous Alt-Fire Rapid mode, and has very nice muzzle flash, and blowback animations, as well as new idle animations, and a cool sprint animation as you have it equipped.\n\n-Much more dangerous combat at higher difficulty modes balancing out the loss of certain hard nonsense obstacles with the new realistic level designs implemented. Enemies are more quick, accurate, can quickly kill you in groups at close range, and are a lot harder to kill as you turn up the difficulty. The bullsquid for example used to be an enemy you could kill quickly at any range, but it now has much higher health, more damaging attacks, and it's spit attack has splash damage that can still be fatal, if most or all of it hits you, and almost more than one magazine of a glock can kill one on Normal assuming all hits land, and their close range attacks are still dangerously damaging, I now hate seeing bullsquids ever so more. And houndeyes not only can destroy you in large groups if allowed to attack in time, their attacks can optionally (can be toggled in settings) Ring your hearing and normally can disorient your vision with their sonic attacks, making it hard to aim and hear, thus making them also more formidable than before.\n\n-I LOVED the new HEV visual intro as you pick up the suit, not only was there a new voice, but when the HEV is checking systems and analyzing defensive weapon selections and vital monitoring, it will show the pieces of the HUD that it is referring to, and use the HUD bloom accordingly to show everything, and will even give a detailed visual interpretation of the suit and the wearer's physical attributes and weight. I also LOVED the loading screens having new fun looks, and gameplay hints showing a really refined experience, and even details like that are what make a game nice to have.\n\n===THINGS I HATED/THINGS THAT NEED A FIX/HOPE TO SEE===\n-Some level hazards from the original game that could still be implemented and not hurt the realistic design are missing, one example is when you go through to restore the power for the blast pit, before you could see a puddle or water, and later it would be electrified forcing you to find a method to get across, or perhaps a new route or vent would be nice to see, but that's only my personal prefence on some of these level hazards, they don't have to be there but it does make some areas easier than they should have been.\n\n-The crobar hitting speed is way too fast, it should be nerfed a bit slower, perhaps the same as HL1's crowbar, I love how the model and animations for the crowbar were improved and more enthusiastic, but the hit speed seems unrealistic and a bit overpowered, and encourages spamming to kill headcrabs rather than accurate timing for their jump trajectory.\n\n-I'm excited to see Xen and anticipate it very much, this is not a con that it's not out yet, I understand the detail you developers want to implement and I say, Take all the time you need, it will be worth the wait for all of us.\n\n\n\n===FINAL THOUGHTS===\n-This game is very fun and it's a whole new experience for Half-Life lovers, even if it's not an official valve game, that doesn't mean it wasn't carefully worked on and detailed, and by the time the full version releases, we will see a very polished and fun game to play with lots of features, some being new over the older HL1, and BMS. Help this developer finish this game and give them what they deserve for their years of hard work and dedication, and enjoy the refreshed experience that even valve liked to see!","May 7, 2015","true","20.7"," 83 of 88 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","83","88","3","4"

If you've never played the half life series before but are turned off by the dated-ness this is a great way to get the same experience with a more modern feeling. It stays true to the original but it's also not a carbon copy.\n\nFor those of you who are familiar, this is not just a fresh coat of paint or some HD textures. It's the entire game redesigned and remastered. The levels and puzzles will be familiar, but the entire thing feels different; it's a totally new experience and  absolutely worth playing.\n\nNow for the thing on everyone's mind: is it worth $20? As a standalone product, absolutely. It delivers enough content with the quality to justify that price tag.\n\nThe point of contention here is that the game was released earlier as a free mod. I haven't played much of the mod, but the money and valve's support here seems to have been used to take the mod a bit beyond what it could achieve as a mod alone - full use of the latest source engine, a multiplayer mode with steam workshop integration for maps, graphics and sound improved even further, gameplay stability improved greatly (I haven't encountered a single bug or glitch on my playthrough).\n\nCertainly, this is an improved experience from the mod and not just the same thing with a price tag slapped on. I'm given to understand the devs have kept the mod release (now legacy version) available for free so it's up to you to decide whether $20 is a worthy asking price.\n\n\n\n","May 10, 2015","true","10.5"," 84 of 94 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","84","94","3","0"

For any newcomers to the series, this is also fantastic, and you should seriously consider making this your entry into the series if you were put off by the original game's age.\n\n\nBlack Mesa is a re-make of Half-Life, that's true, but with the effort put into its development over eight-plus years it might as well be a whole new game. And all because they were dissatisfied with Valve porting it to their then-new physics engine in 2004. Pretty much every aspect has been remastered. Worskhop support lets you modify you experience easier than ever before.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Half-Life...that's okay. You don't have to be. But if you're looking for a solid FPS that doubles as a solid experience, with some brains, a lot of tension (bordering on survival horror at times) and even a little pathos up its sleeve? You could do far worse than this. Just play it on Normal or Easy, for reasons I explain below.\n\nAnd hey, there's multiplayer included with good maps and decent netcode. It's quite similar to HL's deathmatch at HL2 Deathmatch speed, with a much wider range of player model choices. The actual gameplay is still old-school 'player who gets the best guns first gets to kill everyone quicker' for better or worse.\n\n\nOkay, now for more technical details/notes for people who've played the mod's original release or the original Half-Life:\n\nMaps have been streamlined from the mod's first launch and from Half-Life. The gameplay itself is different from HL in only one way: it's generally better. The previously mentioned Marines no longer quite resemble hideously overpowered Counter-Strike aimbots (which was a problem in the original release).\n\nThe only criticism that could be said of the campaign is that the devs made it noticeably harder than the original Half-Life. At times, this makes the game incredibly frustrating on Hard difficulty unless you follow an optimal strategy and know exactly what to expect for some areas. While classic HL had its difficult moments on Hard difficulty, I don't think it'd be unfair to say that some of BM's hardest moments more resemble tactical shooters like classic Rainbow Six/Ghost Recon. Although considering you're effectively playing Joe Schmoe Freeman, PhD and fighting highly trained US Marines, it might be fitting.\n\n(Being able to land consistent crossbow headshots helps if you have ammunition for it; the energy weapons either come too late or are too weak to efficiently dispatch enemies with.)\n\n\nBM's graphics, as you might know, could be described as an improvement. Every security guard no longer looks the same. There's actually women scientists now. The Marines have much better voice acting. The 'Black Mesa' tab in the options menu lets you configure a lot of the game's new graphical effects, such as sideways movement bob, revolver ironsights and houndeye tinnitus.\n\nThe music is pretty good. Not quite as iconic as the original music, but it definitely shines at times. Comprehensive Workshop mod support, map-making tools and Steamworks features are pretty alright too.\n\nBM's most beautiful element to me, though, is the weaponry. The arsenal's feel is massively improved over the original mod's guns; every one of them is great in their own right. I'd say they even give the original game's weapons a good run for their money.\n\n\nI already said the developers have put a huge amount of effort into this thing, but they aren't done, either. As of this writing, they're still working on a version of the final section of Half-Life that they said they wanted to make better than the original. There's also various physics bugs that I'm pretty sure they're working on.\n\nGiven all of this, Black Mesa is well worth paying for. And even if you didn't like Half-Life, I would recommend it.","June 12, 2015","true","22.0"," 60 of 62 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","60","62","2","0"

Some areas of the Black Mesa Research Facility are actually different from the original, which can be very fresh and a new experience if you played and remembered the old Half-Life, however each area can still be compared to the original. While yes, there is a free mod version of this game, the paid version, even while still in early access, holds up much better than the mod version.  For example, I remember the mod version having much more difficult enemies because some of them (for example, the vortigaunts and the HECU troops) had the accuracy of a professionally trained hitman, while still dealing out a heavy amount of damage. While in this version, while they're accurate, their damage is a little less, still creating challenging enemies. Another reason this version's better than the mod version is because the mod version is never getting the final Xen levels due to an outdated version of the Source engine, the paid version is. My only complaint would be that I feel that the weapons are not as efficient as I remember them being, for example the .357 Magnum isn't as powerful on bodyshots as it used to be, and getting headshots during a hectic firefight between a military unit and damn aliens ain't easy.\n\nOverall, despite being in early access, (the devs have stated that the Xen levels will come out in a future update), it's a really good game crafted with love and dedication to the original Half-Life. 9/10.","July 14, 2015","true","27.1"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","59","64","5","3"

Not only is the game Graphically enhanced but the voice lines are all redone and it really is a new game consisting mostly of new textures with a few pulled from HL2, there's also a variety of new npc models made exclusively for Black Mesa. They even included unique models specifically for Dr. Kliener and Eli Vance as their models for HL2 were originally based off the 2 or 3 models for scientists in the original.\n\nAlthough, you might be wondering why I put "finished" in air quotes and that's because the game isn't actually 100% completed yet, they have everything done up until you go into the portal to get to the Borderworld of Xen. Once you go into the portal you get a message saying the assignment has been postponed as they're gathering more research. Essentially what they're saying is that it's not done yet but once it's finished it will be added to the game free of charge!\n\nHowever even without Xen the game is a fantastic deal! It really helps bring the original Half-Life into the modern age of gaming whilst staying true to the story and game play of the original!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/recommended/362890/","Dukefrukem","Dukefrukem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/","811 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Black Mesa team made a considerable effort to make Half-Life look more like Half-Life 2- make the set pieces more realistic, with a thoughtful approach to how a research facility SHOULD look. Let’s be honest, we all thought Half-Life appeared “realistic” back in 1998, but when you play it today, character models look like walking legos and most level layouts made little sense. The point of Black Mesa was to correct that and it appears they do right out of the gate. I need to commend the Black Mesa team for realizing some implausible mistakes in the original opening. In Half-Life, there’s a portion of the track where a gate is lowered that requires the tram to stop to allow the passing of a robot carrying radioactive waste. Would a research facility really build a tram system low enough for this to even be in issue? In Black Mesa, the tram is far overhead as the spider-robot walks by and is merely a sightsee on opening tour. These little enhancements make the world of difference when revisiting New Mexico.

Xen is missing, and along with it, the team promises to deliver a never-before-seen custom “epilogue” chapter to develop the transition to Half-Life 2 when Freeman awakens at G-Man’s beckoning. The good news is that Black Mesa already radiates excellence, and is available for early access. The bad news is it will remind anyone who plays it that Half-Life 3 is in limbo.\n\nhttp://www.geeksundergrace.com/gaming/pc/preview-black-mesa/","March 14","true","15.2"," 42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","42","44","5","0"

The free mod version was a mod. This is a GAME. There's a difference. Black Mesa: Source was a total conversion mod for half life 2, which required the base game to play. That's what makes a mod a mod. This is a standalone game that will from now on get the updates. To put it into perspective, Killing floor was a mod for Unreal tournament before it was a 20 dollar game and you asshats don't complain about that.\n\nWhen I played Black Mesa as a free mod I was thrilled, and when the standalone version came on steam I bought it without a second thought because unlike most people I wanted to support the Crowbar Collective, because if anyone would take the time to read the early access description that you all apparently hate so much, It is stated that they are strapped for resources to continue working on it.\n\nDo yourselves a favor and toss your irritating sense of entitlement aside. These people have been working toward this for 10 years and you're going to rub their face in ♥♥♥♥ because you like your mods free? Guess what. This isn't a mod anymore. Its a GAME.\n\n- Faithful recreation of the source (no pun intended) material\n- significant upgrades since it's days as a mod\n\nSupporting this dedicated team of fans is well worth 20 dollars.

Not sure) I thought I would not exactly be remembering how the game was like, but oh boy was I wrong. I have to say, as I keep playing Black Mesa, there were moments that made me go "Oh dang, I remember this level back in Half-Life. Hey, how the hell do I still remember this?"\n\nI have to say, this rather proves how much of a masterpiece Half-Life 1 truly was, if someone like me who usually forgets about old stuff still remembers certain HL levels in this game.\n\nAnd it's rather interesting but, even though the major difference between Half-Life and Black Mesa would be the graphics, I just could not stop playing. If you really loved Half-Life 1 like I did, then most likely you would not be disappointed.\n\nAnd also, music. I do not remember listening to such super amazing music in certain levels back in Half-Life 1, but I have to say, the badass music that goes out when you get your HEV Suit and how the suit gets ready and all that, that moment is already worth the full price of the game (At least for me).\n\nIs there anything else that I should be writing about?

This modification is less of a modification and more of a total conversion overhaul. This game is a complete rehaul of the original Half Life with almost identical levels & gameplay, what makes this game so special that it's not like any of the other "Half Life" remakes or Half Life: Source? Read on and find out!\n\nThe Story:\nBlack Mesa re-tells us an already very familiar story and amps up the anty by 10, with the solid plot line from the original Half Life with the glory of the Source Engine 2013 technology.\n\nYou are Gordon Freeman, a scientist hired to perform experiements in an underground research lab below Mexico desert. One day on your job you're tasked to insert a rare specimen from the planet "Xen" into a reactor machine which causes a resonance cascade that destroys the research facility, but the worst is yet to come. As you battle your way out of Black Mesa research facility through these strange alien creatures & a corrupt military task force hired to keep the Black Mesa incident a secret and stop anybody that is attempting to escape from the facility a strange man in a blue suit stalks Gordons every move, who is this strange man & why is he here? It's up to you to unravel the mystery of this strange man.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nThe gameplay is the same familiar gameplay you would expect from any Source Engine game, it works identical to that of Half Life 2, it's got solid gameplay, a beautifully & lovingly crafted modification that everyone expected "Half Life: Source" to be but were let down, this is what we wanted from Valve but in the end we got it from a very tallented modding team.\n\nThe Verdict:\nWith a complete overhaul of Half Life you can expect things to be compaired to the original & with this total conversion you should expect to see a few significant changes to the original game, some new places to explore, some alternate paths to take and some new faces to encounter, although not identical to the original game it's very cannon to the original & nothing that is in the game feels out of place.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, the guns feel like the original game & most importantly the game has 100% it's own content, nothing is stock Half Life 2 assets, even the enemies are recreated with rather noteable modifications, they even went as far as to add their own voice actors to the game rather than using the voices from Half Life 2, however in the Steam release you will hear that a few of the characters are using the original voice actors from Half Life 1 & 2, this is nice to have the noteable voices back in a game that is trying to be the Half Life game it does so well to replicate.\n\nDo I Recommend This Game?:\nYes i certainly recommend this game, if you're still on the fence about paying for a modification then you can try the free version of this available here: http://www.blackmesasource.com/\n\nIf you DO NOT own the original Half Life you SHOULD own this! If you own the original Half Life you still SHOULD own this!\n\nIf after playing the free version you still don't feel like buying the game then there's nothing i can say to make you change your mind. However i will say that the money you spend here is going towards making these modders into an indie developer company which you should do as you can see they've really poured their heart and soul into this game which could easily be improved further.","May 7, 2015","true","2.3"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","33","40","4","0"

If there's a few points to nit-pick for example the fact you don't get the crowbar untill later on in the game compared to the original and you have to run past zombies with a moronic AI and hope he can kill them so you can get past them, the fact that "bunny hopping" seems to fail way too much but that's probably because of the source engine not to mention the fact that bunny hopping is rendered a useless skill any way because they added a sprint function. Other than that it's extremely well made and for the newer generation who may not have had the privilege of experiencing Half Life and have been spoiled by next generation graphics then i highly suggest you pick this up. If how ever graphics do not bother you i would say just get the original Half Life. Or Sven since that has the original half life on it and it is free as well as not requiring the base game. Plus the multiplayer is a added bonus to Sven.","January 27","true","4.1"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","26","29","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/362890/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlthough in early access only, Black Mesa is an excellent pastime for those who like reminiscing about the past and find it almost exquisite to play one of their favourite, classic FPS games in a greatly enhanced form. Yes, this is Half Life 1 but this time envisioned thanks to the amazing Source engine that made it possible for us to play the sequel along with the Left 4 Dead franchise.\n\nBelow are my pros and cons about this conversion:\n\n+++ The game looks stunning! The creators did not just make a conversion but changed some of the environments. Added several items here and there to make severals rooms / hallways more realistic. Laboratories are now full of equipment; towards the end game we can really feel like being part of an ongoing war between the military and the invaders! Also, the faces of the characters look pretty cool - I assume this is a later iteration of the Source engine hence the better facial animations.\n+++ Extra dialogue options: Especially true to the first level; just keep pressing E until you hear everything the scientists or guards have to say. And oh boy there's plenty they want to share with you!\n+++ Achievements: Good ones, I have to admit! Remember the scientist in the toilet? Pass him the toilet paper!  Also, make sure you ruin the casserole in the microwave oven in the kitchen just like you did it in 1998. As the game is unfinished there are no story-related achievements at this point.\n\n--- Sometimes enemies get stuck in one place. They just get frozen and do not react until you shoot them. It can be pretty annoying sometimes as tough battles can be completed too easily after several reloads.\n--- This game is sure quite difficult! Even on normal difficulty level the soldiers can hit you from afar - this is pretty unfair and your kevlar (=HEV suit) gets depleted pretty fast almost all the time. Interestingly, the vortigaunts and the big soldier aliens are quite easy to get rid of (especially the big guys were annoying in the vanilla game). The battle on the dam with the helicopter is particularly challenging as the creators did not put enough cover there.\n--- And the biggest issue of all: the game is unfinished. Once you jump into the portal to make your way to Xen the game ends. I initially played Black Mesa 2 or 3 years ago (downloaded from the creators' website - Steam release came only this year) and while many adjustments have been made since the 4 remaining chapters (chapter 15-18) are still missing.\n\nOverall, this is a nicely done conversion. It ups the difficulty level so those getting used to today's casual games may find it quite challenging. While 10 euros are not much for the game (this is the lowered price - it gets discounted regularly) perhaps it's best to wait until Black Mesa is fully completed. However, if you are an avid fan of Gordon Freeman's journey just like myself grab it right away!","December 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","26","30","2","0"

Not easier, just less frustrating. Some levels have been expanded, while others that felt like they were dragging on, were cut in size, especially the infamous rollercoaster ride. Oh, and the HECU soldiers were sent back to their boot camp and came back thrice as deadly. You'll be cursing like crazy whenever you overhear their radio chatter, because it means a tough fight lies ahead. The aleins are more deadly as well, especially Vortigaunts and Houndeyes. The latter posed next to no threat in the original game - here, if you don't kill them as soon as they appear, they'll mess you up. Bad. And they always hunt in pack of three or more.\n\nIn terms of graphics CC achieved something unimaginable - you're playing a Source game, and yet, when you look at it, it doesn't look like a Source game. Hundreds of new assets and textures, as well as new effects make it look like it was made in a completely different engine. The textures are crisp enough for you to be able to read what's written on the candy boxes inside vending machines and on computer screens. Everything has been modelled from a scratch, with the possible exception of dr. Kleiner's head. I hold a special place in my heart for the shotgun. The original looked and sounded like a toy, while this one feels like you're holding a gunmetal-black rabid beast that's only being held back by your trigger finger. "It can obliterate everything short of a battle tank", © NerfNow.com\n\n\nSounds were easily the weakest aspect of HL1, and boy am I glad they all got replaced by new ones in Black Mesa. Not by the default, stock Source sounds, mind you. Everything sounds different. Okay, the sprinting "gasp" is still the same, but we're technically playing as the same guy, seeing how Freeman hasn't aged by the time Half-Life 2 storyline starts. Kudos to Gordon's VA, you did a tremendous job. Freeman's voice never sounded so natural. The music is a little miracle in its own right, captures the mood and the scenery it's played in perfectly, and has a certain "HL2" feel to it. You'll know what I mean once you get to play the game.\n\nBM really has limtlessss potential.","February 18","true","15.9"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","35","47","5","3"

It wasn't until 2012 that, by complete accident, I stumbled upon Half-Life after having bought it in a bundle. I tried it, and it changed my take on gaming forever. To this day, it is still, in my opinion, the most ambitious milestone in video game history, along with The Legend Of Zelda : Ocarina Of Time and BioShock. Like these two other games, it brought storytelling to a new dimension, which had only ever been reached by the greatest movie directors of the last century.\n\nVALVe has my eternal respect for this major creation, but this respect is now shared with those who did what Gaben's Padawans couldn't do : make this legendary title live up to its sequel. The Crowbar Collective did a marvelous job, and they did it for free, until the creators of the franchise realized the power of this remake, and made the modders the ultimate gift : to sell their creation, as a reward for their outstanding achievement.

As Early Access adds new features to the game, expect to give it a few more playthroughs along the way (also, try to get the hidden hat achievement). Then you've also got the multiplayer, which is a great and very well constructed throwback to classic 1990s deathmatch. It's a lot of fun and though the map selection right now isn't too good, more levels are on the way.\n\nAs for the singleplayer: well, you've got a remake/reimagining of one of the greatest and most innovative games ever made. For one, it looks, feels and for all intents and purposes, plays better than the original, which sometimes suffered from issues inherent to games made in the late 90s. You've got a few clever surprises on the way that subvert player expectations in really cool ways, although they're few and far between. Overall, the story has been improved and in some ways expanded, a lot of new dialogue has been added, the environmental "mise en scene" storytelling has been conserved if not improved. In a lot of respects it's simply a better experience - with all the amenities, details and mechanics of HL2 but the satisfying difficulty, diversity, setting, atmosphere and engagement of HL1.\n\nHowever, significant parts of the game have been removed almost brutally, without any attempts at improving or streamlining them (the We've Got Hostiles vent crawl, almost half of On A Rail and a good third of Surface Tension). It just doesn't add anything to the experience and it stands out like a sore thumb on an experience that is otherwise light-years beyond anything AAA-supported studios put together these days (that includes Valve until they finally get around to making another singleplayer game).","May 20, 2015","true","21.5"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","32","43","0","11"

Duh.\n\nThe amount and quality of the recreated content is amazing. Granted, there are many bugs, specially in regard to the artificial intelligence, and some of them do break the flow of the game, requiring a reload (to be fair, this happened just once, when I was trying to push a bit the limits of the linear gameplay). Other than that, it's great. Stuff's optimized for the level of graphic (and oh yes, it's graphic) detail, too: rarely I had any significant frame rate drop.

The whole plot really kicks off when you (and the fellow scientists) create a so called resonance cascade, this resonance cascade opens up a portal to Xen. A safe haven for aliens fleeing from their enemies. Aliens from Xen go through the portal and start tearing up Black Mesa, headcrabs infecting people, vortigaunts killing scientists and guards.

Which basically means that in some areas you have to use this technique to get from point A to point B, which can result in you being "stuck" for some time-\n\n\n\nWhat they can improve on:\n\nAdding Xen (duh)\n\nExpanded facial and appearance (bags, vests and helmets) customisation for death match.\n\nNew player models for death match.\n\nCo-op maps with unique level design (maybe a mini boss at the end)\n\nAnd of course XEN!!!!

If you are a fan, if you are collecting Half-Life series, this is must have.\n\nThe upside: A great restart of Half-Life 1. Not an exact copy, something was moved, something was cut, something was added just because developers thought it'd be more fun. And hell yes, they were right, I think all the little differences bring more fun to the game. Questionable Ethics chapter is marvelous, On a Rail is shorter and less messed up, and that second Gargantua approach in Surface Tension changed and is way more cool and unexpected.\n\nOther changes: Soundtrack is written from scratch. There is no old tracks, everything is replaced by new music, which in my opinion sounds really awesome. From atmospheric lyric music to aggressive combat encounters, the composer hits all the right spots.\n\nThe downside: The time. It's becoming a tradition of everything Half-Life-ish. It's been so long since it was announced, I believe first trailer stated release date 2008 or '09, it was first released like 2012 without last Xen chapters and yet still it lacks them. We all are patiently waiting, but for some reason the content updates cover multiplayer, animations, model fixes and changes, some map polishing.\nThe second bad thing about this game is AI for soldiers, on all difficulty settings they are really dumb. Changing difficulty just changes their aim and damage received from their guns. But I believe that's true for all Source-HL series, remembering how dumb it was in HL2 sometimes...\n\nWhy should you buy it here and not play the free version instead? This features slightly better source engine version, multiplayer, content updates and bug fixes, steam achievements, steam cards and badges. You might want to buy it to support dem lazy ♥♥♥ devs that bring you this marvelous HD remake. I think all HD remakes should be like this.

If things have changed for the better, I will give it a positive recommendation.\nHalf-Life and it's sequel are my favorite first person shooters. The franchise offers a unique experiance to the genre that has yet to be surpassed. I have replayed them hundreds of times!\n\nBlack Mesa offers an incredible re-imagining of Half-Life. Both in terms of it's gorgeous visuals and spectacular audio. The people who were responsible for it's detailed  environments, sound design and character development are a top notch level of talent! The Crowbar Collective has offered a stellar tribute to one of the greatest games of all  time. I wouldn't change anything about what the game offers in terms of its presentation.\n\nWhat I would change is the most important part of any fps, the combat. The developers have decided against an exact replication of the original game. There certainly is nothing wrong with that choice. In fact I am overjoyed they decided to optimize some of Half-Life's more tedious and unnecessarily long chapters. While this has worked to improve the games pacing, it has hurt a crucial area of it's mechanics.\n\nBlack Mesa's redesign of the weapons makes fighting enemies far more aggravating. This is partially due to the larger number of enemies that have been included into the new ambush sections. Dealing with these new threats is particularly difficult because the reduced amounts of ammo that can be carried. Also, the damage in certain weapons (Specifically anything using explosives) has been reduced substantially compaired with the arsenal in Half-Life. Let me use the submachine-gun as a perfect example.\n\nThe SMG from Half-Life One:\nAmmo: 50 round clip - 250 reserve - 10 grenades. Fairly accurate with a fair amount of recoil that was automatically compensated by Freeman.\n\nAs anyone knows the amount of ammo and number of guns was reduced significantly from half life one to its sequel. However whatever Valve took away they added something to replace it.\n\nThe SMG from Half-Life Two:\nAmmo: 45 round clip - 225 reserve - 3 grenades. Very accurate and faster firing speed with a small amount of recoil that was automatically compensated by Freeman.\n\nWhile we lost a small amount of bullets and large number of grenades, we gained a far\nmore accurate SMG with a higher rate of fire.\n\nThis is what the SMG looks like in Black Mesa:\nAmmo: 30 round clip - 150 reserve - 3 grenades. Accurate in small bursts with a fair amount of recoil that is NOT compensated by Freeman. Grenades damage and area of effect was also reduced.\n\nBy these numbers the new SMG should be pin point accurate, no recoil at all and should fire even faster. The alternative being that the grenades should be at least 2 times more powerful than either of the Half-Life's.\n\nWhile I could certainly go over the issues I have for each of the weapons, I won't.\nInstead I will offer a quick list of changes that, in my opinion, would make for a better tribute.\n\n1: Pistol - Half-Life 2 - Semi-Auto is love, Semi-Auto is life.\n2: Magnum - Half-Life 2 - Suit Zoom + Accuracy = Head shot.\n3: SMG - See Above... :-)\n4: Shotgun - Half- Life 1 - Needs interruptible reload animation.\n5: Crossbow - Remove the arch, faster reload, 25 ammo.\n6: RPG - Please fix the laser guidance.

I purchased this on release day as i have been following this mod since it's infancy.\n\nHowever, i cannot recommend it. it is an incomplete game, with unnecessary multiplayer and workshop support before the single player experience is completed. i understand the early access model and have to be a bit frustrated as the free mod was released over 3 years ago and the paid version is creeping up on a year. Yet all that has been said is "Its being worked on". I had no issues at all purchasing the game, as i really wanted to support development and experience a retelling of Gordon's introduction. But i feel that development shifted to workshop and multiplayer, and away from the single player experience to sell it as a multiplayer game to try and get the CS players interested.  Half Life is not about multiplayer, and is about a "Man in the wrong place, At the right time" The release of xen is approaching the fate that has fell upon the story, we got a cliffhanger in ep2 8 years ago. and still no news on xen after 4 years.\n\nIf i can change this to a recommendation in 2020 when we get news that xen will be out before 2050, I will consider changing it at that time.\n\nWhen the developers either pass the torch to someone else or completely abandon it, some form of closure will be acceptable.","March 3","false","11.9"," 129 of 221 people (58%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","58","129","221","12","0"

I want to say it's 'one of the best', but it really does top off all HL2 MODs I have ever played. This review will cover the following: Price, and development.\n\nLike most people, I like to get myself a good bargain. I never usually pay full price for games - especially games that were previously released for free. Would have I spent £14.99/$20 on a free game that became paid afterwards? Definitely not. Would have I paid that much to get quicker updates, receive a game I knew I was going to enjoy for longer than most modern games, have the game permanently registered onto my Steam account, and best of all, support the developers? ...I think this is already answered! (Not to mention any buyers are also supporting Valve in the process!)\n\nWith the many years of development put into it, starting with the same comical style you would expect in the start of Half-Life, continuing with the most beautiful model designs, textures, map layouts etc, and then ending with a brilliantly altered storyline - the developers really have outdone themselves! You really do feel like this is what Half-life should have been if it was made 20 years later as it still has that nice old style and clearly, as the game intends, it doesn't modernise itself too much! Whilst the storyline is based off HL1, you still get the nice treat and change now and then which makes you think 'this wasn't in HL1' - and that's what makes it even more enjoyable! You still get the HL1 experience, and you get the nice little Easter egg or slight path change to enjoy something else in the meantime!\n\nSeriously, hats off to Crowbar Collective. They have worked to their fullest to provide us with this incredible MOD and no doubt they have put more effort into this game than most other modern developers have into current games that are far more popular!","May 13, 2015","true","13.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","2"

The Crowbar Collective definitely achieved their goal, Black Mesa is nothing short of Phenomenal. Over the years it has won various awards, and even with a year or so of inactivity on their ModDB profile at the time, Black Mesa was still nominated to the top 10 mods of the year almost every time, and for a very good reason.\n\nBlack Mesa is very true to the original Half-Life in terms of level design, gameplay and difficulty, but at the same time it feels familar yet different, it is not a direct carbon copy. The chapter Questionable Ethics and Lambda Core are good examples of this. Some maps and areas are diferent or cut somewhat shorter such as On a Rail and Surface Tension which are both missing some sections found in the original game, this is the only real drawback, but it delivers in almost ever other aspect. All of the weapons you use in the original game make a return too, and while they now have a more limited aummunition capacity, they look excellent and are fun to use.\nOn top of the graphical overhaul, Black Mesa delivers in terms of depth too, some excellent voiceacting and dialog really help add to the imersive atmosphere and explaining the story and situation further, not to mention the excellent quality of the maps making the game more atmospheric than it has ever been before.\n\nNow that Black Mesa is available on Steam to purchase as a standalone game, I couldn't recommend it more. The gameplay is solid and the game itself is flawlessly beautiful. The addition of achievements, the Steam Workshop and automatic updates add much more to make Black Mesa even better and reliable. Valve themselves couldn't have done a better job on this, definitely worth the asking price.\n\nDo note that Black Mesa is still under development, hence "Early Access", so the Xen portion of the game currently doesn't exist.","May 12, 2015","true","19.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

You've got much better graphics, better sounds, really awesome reskinned guns, and the same level layout we all remember and love.*\n\n*A few areas have been slightly redesigned and some long, drawn out areas have been shortened seamlessly. Ultimately not a big deal to me, especially since there's workshop mods you can download that restore the cut areas.\n\nThe main thing I didn't like was the new voice acting. It's all right, I just prefer the original. I also prefer the music of the original but the new music here is good too.\n\nIt should be noted that currently the game only goes up to the portal that sends you to Xen; Xen will be finished at a later date and added to the game for free (of course). What is here is still many hours of fun with the promise of more to come! Also there's multiplayer but I didn't mess with that.\n\nSo is this game worth $20? It's a complete reimagining of Half-Life, FAR more than a simple graphics mod. Therefore yes I feel it's worth it, especially if you're a huge fan of the Half-Life series and want more.","May 11, 2015","true","19.1"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

Seriously? Fine. The story takes place at the Black Mesa Research Facility in New Mexico. You play as a theoretical physicist named "Gordon Freeman". You are heading off to your normal day of work and to nobody's surprise everything goes to hell. You are then sent throughout the Black Mesa Research Facility against both the U.S. Military and aliens alike, starting your adventure in the Sector C research labs, making your way through the offices of Black Mesa, the railway transits, hell that is known as the surface, and then the lambda complex. (To be Continued: Xen.) The game is basically one long "Get from Point A to Point B" with a bunch of puzzles, confusing level design (To new players), and some small boss battles along the way. But with the twist of the design forcing you to plot how you will play the game through, make you conserve your ammunition, and at some points question your mental sanity and wonder how the hell you're supposed to get through that room with 3 health and no armour left at all.\n\n\n\nLevel Design:\n\nCan you really count "Level Design" since it's a remake? Damn straight you can. A lot of small and large changes were made to the game's levels. Even adding some new areas to the game. Some of the more noticeable changes are the scenery during the introductory tram ride, sector C laboratories, and the surface areas. It's just enough of a difference to keep the game going without making it feel like you're playing something that isn't Half-Life 1.\n\nDownside in the level design: The "Vent maze" and the "Tram maze" were cut from the Steam version of the game as the developers said they don't feel they were made to their standards. A user has re-uploaded them from the mod version to work compatibly with the game on the Steam Workshop.(On a Rail Link) (We've got Hostiles Link)\n\n\nCutscenes:\n\nThe game has been given a much more dramatic feel with more voice actors, facial generation, and quite a few added little cutscenes and dialogue. For example in Half-Life 1: "What the hell are you still doing here? Get topside I hear troops are coming to rescue us." Almost every guard or hiding scientist has their little story to share when you find them. All the existing cutscenes in the game have been overhauled amazingly well, one of my favourite being the "Tentacle Scene" in the rocket firing chamber. which has seen some rather nice improvement in visuals and sounds from the mod version. Also the new voices for the HECU soldiers in the Steam version are a ton better than the original mod version's in my opinion.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNqVc5Nq8_k\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game itself plays relatively similar to Half-Life 1 with added physics, but controls and moves as if it were Half-Life 2. You have the option in the "Black Mesa" section of the options menu to make your character always run, more like Half-Life 1 was. Holding sprint in either mode will make the player run significantly faster and play an animation on all weapons other than the crossbow and the satchel charge. The weapons all function the same. Satchels explode on command, grenades have their same insane movement influence in gravity.\n\n\nSoundtrack:\n\nJoel Nielson did an amazing job. Damn near perfect. (My personal favourite song being the first On a Rail segment) The soundtrack seems to fit amazing with the ambiance and progression of the game and it's story. The combat music is some of the better sides (Questionable Ethics #1 being an exceptional example) and fits very well into the Half-Life feel of the game. I truly imagine this mod would not have made it as far without his works added to the game.\n\n\nOther:\n\nThe visuals, sound, and AI for the game have been extremely improved upon. (AKA HECU and scientists no longer run into grenades.) The visuals to the game are extreme. Quality you'd expect from an actual game studio. Albeit limited due to the source engine. The sound design is superb, meant for modern systems with surround sound providing an extremely immersive experience.\n\nA few smaller new features were added to Black Mesa, such as an auto-crouch jump (This can be turned off from the "Black Mesa" section of the options menu). Which I can only feel was added solely because of DSP.\n\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nNote: The multiplayer is incomplete as of the current time this review was written and has some changes planned to be made. I will keep this section bound to core elements only.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game in multiplayer plays near parallel to Half-Life: Deathmatch's. And yes, crossbow bolts explode again. The multiplayer maps are being remade and modified to Black Mesa's play style and completely overhauled in visuals. It feels essentially like Half-Life Deathmatch but with an HD remake overlayed over it, but with changes in all the right places.\n\n\nLevels: (?)\n\nThe multiplayer maps have to be downloaded from the Steam Workshop. If I have to guess this is so the developers can easily update a map without having to release an update for the entire game. As of the current time there are the following maps available from play officially from the BMS team: "dm_rocketfire, dm_tension, dm_office, dm_rail, dm_shipping, dm_boom, and dm_power". Adding up to seven maps currently.\n\n\n\nA list of the good, and the bad:\n\nGood:\n\n- Complete Overhaul. Not much more needs to be said there.\n\n- Balanced and fun to play multiplayer which will have more features in future updates\n\n- Just holy hell that soundtrack.\n\n- Plenty of little Easter eggs, inside jokes, and references to find everywhere.\n\n- More improvements than the free mod version\n\nBad:\n\n- The AI can still show it's typical for the source engine at times (Several times I've walked up to HECU Soldiers and they did not do anything but stare at me with their gun practically in my throat.)\n\n- Being on Source, you can expect both good physics, but at the same time physics that will break at a moments notice and likely injure or damage the player.\n\n- Just holy hell, the human assassins will swarm the player and just spray away with their guns, making it extremely difficult to kill them without explosives or wild gunfire before dying. (You have about 5-10 seconds on the medium difficulty before they kill you.)\n\n\nMy "Overall" rating would be ultimately a  9.4 out of 10.\n\nThe game itself is very balanced in both singleplayer and multiplayer aspects, the game plays and runs fluently. I've got no real complains outside the human assassin's tendency to swarm the player.","May 9, 2015","true","23.5"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","64","27","42","17","0"

Read at your own risk.\n\nI can safely say, that this is one of the best video game remakes that i have ever gotten to experience in my life. It's the treatment Half-Life, one of the best FPS games ever developed, deserved.\n\nBlack Mesa, while having a special touch to itself, still reminds you of Half-Life when you play it.\n\nStory: The story is the same as the original Half-Life. You play as the scientist Gordon Freeman, and have to escape from the Black Mesa Research facility after an experiment goes horribly wrong. On your way out, you will encounter hostile aliens such as Vortigaunts, who are invading the facility and killing everyone they see. Later in the game you will also have to fight against human soldiers who have been sent in to "clean up" the situation. The game's story is just as refreshing as the original game.\n\nGameplay: Gameplay wise, Black Mesa plays nearly the same as the original game. You use weapons, ranging from the iconic crowbar, pistols, SMGs, shotguns to rocket propelled grenade launchers and even alien weapons. However, there's been some noticeable changes to certain chapters, such as We've got hostiles and Surface Tension. People used to today's FPS games will find Black Mesa somewhat difficult to play, with it's old school mechanics such as crouch-jumping. But overall, the gameplay is great, and sometimes even better than the original.\n\nGraphics: Despite the Source Engine's dated techonology, Black Mesa definatively manages to look beautiful, and is certainly how Half-Life should look with today's graphics. The scenery, NPC's, props... everything looks great.\n\nSound: Soundwise, Black Mesa does good most of the time. The music is fantastic, Joel Nielsen did a great job at composing the tracks for the game. However, it can occasionally feel out of place in the respective situations. The voice acting was pretty good too. The Scientists and Security Guards voices capture the feel of Harry S Robins respective Michael Shapiro. The Soldier's voice acting feels... better than they were in the mod version where they sounded like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nIn conclusion, Black Mesa does a good job of bringing Half-Life to newer generations, even with some few flaws that it has. Even if you played the original game before, it's still worth paying to play this amazing remake.\n\nWritten by the gaming dinosaur, Littlefoot.","July 16, 2015","true","11.9"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","1"

If you're an avid player of first person shooters you owe it to yourself to play Black Mesa (or the original HL).  This game was groundbreaking back when it was new.  Just like playing Super Mario is my cornerstone of platformer games, Half-Life is my cornerstone of first person shooters/adventure games.

It really shows how big of a fan the developers are of the Half-Life series. I have never seen a group of people put so much effort into a free mod that is being turned into a work of art and something that will be recognized world wide as a master piece.  With all that said, the multiplayer needs a ton of work:\n1) The game crashes often\n2) Very poor performance (studdering, low framerate, ladders are very laggy and netcode needs optimization)\n3) The bunny bhop doesn't work well\n4) The crossbow zoom isn't instant, can't quick zoom\n5) Crossbow bolts aren't hitscan like HL1DM or Adrenaline gamer\n6) The gauss charges slower than HL/AG\n7) The gauss no longer does splash damage on corner wall shots\n8) The gauss doesn't penetrate walls effectively and do splash damage behind\n9) Suit chargers are not 30 points anymore (75 now) and charge way too quickly for competitive play\n10) Spawning takes up to 7 seconds or more and the camera follows the fragger.  HL/AG is instant respawn and HL2DM is 4 seconds.  This isn't ideal for competitive play especially when playing 2v2's and 3v3's.\n\nI really hope the developers keep these things in mind and implement them as the game gets developed.  As of right now, the game is no where near ready for competitive play (weapon and gameplay wise).  Alot of old HL1DM and Adrenaline gamer players that quit in late 2005 would only come back if these major unique gameplay features are implemented.  The days of fast paced arena deathmatch games of the late 90's and early 00's are long gone but I hope this game gives that genre one last breath.\n","May 12, 2015","true","11.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","3"

Thanks HEV suit for adding the new rapid-fire crowbar functionality!\n\n10/10 would crowbar insanely fast again.\n\n\nHonestly, as much as I want to beat the crap out of this mod for charging $20 when I ratted on Aperture Tag for costing $7, I can't. By comparison, this is actually worth your money. Where Aperture Tag was a literal mod that required a base game and only provided a whopping 3 hours of gameplay with an innovative but forgettable gameplay design, this comes with roughly double to triple that in single player gameplay (with more being added later), multiplayer, and it's entirely standalone.\n\nThe devs of this have worked their rear ends off to get this to where it is, with 8 years of work or so now. I have to praise every moment of it too, as while a lot of it is due to it simply being Half Life, this is also infinetly more enjoyable as Half Life has started to age a bit. The music and sound design is absolutely superb, the graphics are some of the best the source engine has to offer, and the atmosphere and gameplay have been massively improved, not taken away from, by this mod. This is not a simple graphical upgrade, but rather a full redesign of the entire game from the ground up. That means redesigned levels, movement, AI, etc. with all of it being extremely well made. It helps to make the entire game far more immersive, and it ends making me wish there was more - I know Xen is on the way, but that's not enough. The design of this mod is so great, it makes me want more of EVERYTHING. WHERE IS HALF LIFE 3, GABEN?\n\nAs it stands, I haven't touched the multiplayer yet, but I have run through the single player. I felt scared, alone, excited, surprised, and overall felt immersed far more into this than I ever could into the 1998 Half Life. Multiplayer is effectivelly a rehash of the original deathmatch, but now with workshop support and various other improvements. I imagine it would add many, MANY hours onto an already fantastic game, easily doubling or tripling what you can already get.\n\nIt's honestly hard to stop gushing and face facts, but there are some. This game has its' issues. I've encountered issues with enemies spawning in as blank, unanimated corpses that do nothing, issues with the AI getting permanently stuck on something, issues with clipping my view through stuff, and issues with sound effects overlapping each other to the point of my headset giving up and just delivering a blank rather than actual sound. And, admittedly, a lot of the gush is made possible simply because this is based on the fantastic Half Life. Were it not for that, I cannot say if it would be as good as it is.\n\nHowever, I would indeed say buy this. You will not only get your money's worth, but you will be supporting devs who have been caring for this project for MANY years now, as well as simple convinience of things like auto-updating and such when new content and fixes come out.

After the implementation of the re-designed Xen chapters, and possibly the uncut versions of the chapters: "On A Rail" and\n"Surface Tension", this re-invisionment of the classic first-person shooter could not be anymore perfect.","September 13, 2015","true","93.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","2"

All the aliens present in both half-life and half-life 2 have been updated to the half-life 2 models, and the aliens only present in half-life have been updated to a standered that you would expect from half-life 2, if not even better. All the weapons have updated models aswell. I also own half life:source, and I always found the soldiers could kill you to easily, not so with Black Mesa. While the soldiers are by no means "easy pickings", they are much easier to kill and are a far more fair fight than the one in half life:source. Currently 85 percent of all the chapters are complete, with just the Xen chapters left to finish. This is probably why it is still listed as early access, not because it may have some bugs, (I myself have experianced none so far), but because it is simply not finished. In conclusion if you dont own half life but want to buy it, I would buy this instead as the better graphics and updated models will have you more engrosed in the story and its characters. I would also reccomend it to people who owned the original half life and loved it, because this game does it justice very well.","August 28, 2015","true","22.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

Black Mesa is in my opinion BETTER than Half-Life, it cuts out all the fat of the\norginal Half-Sandwich and adds some new and interesting mechanics (One example of a cut was the complete absense of those annoying ♥♥♥ leeches). The gameplay picked itself up with a sprint mechanic and best of all you get to shove your hand up the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a helpless creature. The story remains the same however important characters from Half-Life 2 make their appearance in Black Mesa, the game runs swimingly but one issue remains: that good ol' fashioned slippery Gordon. If you haven't played the OG Half-Life allow me to update you when you dare attempt to climb a ladder or jump a gap Gordon moves around as if he has butter on his shoes and a shiv up his ♥♥♥, to aid this the developers did add a better ladder mechanic but platforming can still be a tad awkward.\nTo be frank if you don't like the orginal Half-Brisket this game may or may not be a waste of your hard earned chore money.\nBut all in all I rate it 8 Alien Molesters out of 10","April 18","true","14.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","9","11","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rastrelly/recommended/362890/","rastrelly","Rastrelly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rastrelly/","556 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf Black Mesa still was a usual mod, I'd give it as many positive screams as possible, and would be running with it around screaming on every corner how awesome it is. Basically, at the time I more or less did it, when original mod came out. But this is not a mod. This is a game that's sold for a price. This is a PRODUCT. Even more so, this is now just another HD remake, like Homeworld Remastered, Majesty Gold HD or Silent Hill 2 HD. And I am evaluating it exactly this way.\n\nHalf Life - the original game - was nearly flawless in terms of level design. Environments were expressive, but never restrictive, all levels differed from one another, and the game was overall one whole innovation. But this is not 1998, it is 2015. How does this remake hold up?\n\nLet's start with some positives. Environments are stunningly great. Details on all models and in all location are epic - you can see there was a lot of attention put into the game. Same goes to new models, like bullsquids, military guys, alien grunts, black ops, helicopters and so on. All areas look more or less realistic. Huge machinery is simply breathtakingly awesome.\n\nAll weapons are back as well, and they all are quite pleasant to use.\n\nStory wise nothing has changed - it is the same old Half-Life with some lore-friendly elements added from Half-Life 2, like Dr. Vance and Dr, Kleiner.\n\nMost of the levels follow the original with added level of details like additional doors to mimic open environments. Some areas changed though - especially Surface Tension level, which got a lot bigger, and On The Rail, getting MUCH smaller.\n\nMusic came out to be great and atmospheric, an actual improvement over original soundtrack, I must admit.\n\nBut what's bad? Level design and atmosphere - this is where problems start to pop up. For starters, some later levels were showing alien infestation spreading in the area - weird fungus, strange surfaces, odd looking formations; in this game there are THREE areas which at least resemble alien infested zones that were in the original, and they both seem soooo much out of place because the rest is absent.\n\nIn Half-Life there were areas where you needed to get help from guards and scientists - now there is only one area where you REQUIRE them. Also there is zero tension between Freeman and military now. Famous "Forget about Freeman!" line is now absolutely out of place - mostly thanks to super-cut On the Rail level, whic actually was built around the idea of marines hating Freeman even more then the aliens.\n\nBut the worst part is combat itself. It swings around from ridiculously easy (like vortigaunts fire, which can be avoided like there is none) to absurdly hard, as in case of helicopter fight on the cliff (made better in 0.2 patch, still annoying though). This comes from reworked enemy patterns, which were crafted with great care in the original, and seem pretty much random in Black Mesa.\n\nUber-detalisation I mentioned before, while improving visuals, harms level awareness, making some areas too obscure and hard to orient, which never was the case in Half-Life, and obviously will not be fixed at release.\n\nSome things can be credited to Early Access state - like possibility to see into nothingness in some areas, camera often clipping through models, and even untriggered ladder in final area (before leaping to Xen).\n\nAs a mod, it would be a great experience for nostalgic players. But as a standalone game? It feels too amateur to be taken seriously, and I highly doubt it will get better a release point.\n\nI can advise this to extreme fans who wish to experience nostalgia only; all the rest - grab original Half-Life, it's a much better option.\n\nP.S. AI and animation bugs, as I hope, will be fixed in release version, so I don't put emphasis on it.","May 11, 2015","false","12.9"," 605 of 1,139 people (53%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","53","605","1","37","96"

It combines the best of both Half-Life and Half-Life², into one very solid game, with the technology of the Source engine. If you played the mod version that was released about 3 years ago, you will be very surprised to see that the standalone version is almost an entirely different game, attributed to the amount of upgrades and polishing that has been done to the single-player campaign. Most of the weapons have new models, and all of them have completely new animations. The MP5, Hand Grenades and explosive Satchel Charges have received some gameplay improvements, with the MP5 now being full auto, rather than 3-round-burst. Hand Grenades and Satchel Charges can now be thrown much farther than in the previous version, and you can now cook grenades to have them detonate sooner after being thrown. Voice acting in this version is top-notch, with a lot of lines being re-done to do a better job at making the characters seem more like real people.\n\nThe new multiplayer mode of the game is really really fun, and it is very similar to the multiplayer component of the original Half-Life, although it currently seems to almost lack the ability to bunny-hop. Weapon balance seems to be pretty good, although in my opinion, the Tau Cannon's secondary fire should need to be charged for a longer period of time to be a one-shot kill.\n\nNow for the big question... is the game currently worth it? That's a decision that I can't make for you. If you're a huge fan of Half-Life and you really think you'll enjoy what the game currently has to offer, then, by all means purchase the game. I see the $20 price tag as more of a donation to the developers than an actual price for the game itself. The Crowbar Collective has been working on Black Mesa for about 10 years at this point, and now is the best time for the community to show even more appreciation for their work.

Sure, graphics, game-play or the engine: No need to argue,  Half-Life2 + episodes win these points. For me personally, the bigger impact (mainly the  atmosphere), had the first part. So, just keep in mind, this review is a pretty subjective one.\n\nI was pretty happy, when I saw the first few screenshots and facts, from the Black Mesa Project. Then, they released the free modification and it was overwhelming. I saw so much love for details, while playing. It felt like the good old classic, but in a fresh and modern environment. It´s also not a simple 1:1 remake, they also brought in some little changes and ideas, but never destroying the atmosphere of the original. Sure, the current Source-engine is not state-of-the-art anymore, but can still be impressing, if you ask me.\n\nIf you like the first Half-Life, this modification is simply a must-play!\n\nI remembering the heated debate, when Valve thought about an option to pay for mods, some weeks ago. I understand most of the points of both sides, but the day they were offering Black Mesa-Early Access on steam-store, there was no alternative for me: Shut the hell up and take my fu&%$& money. :-)\n\nIf you don´t want to pay for it/early access, it´s okay.

The original Half-Life is one of my favorite games of all time. I first saw it as Half-Life: Uplink at my friends house in 1999. I really enjoyed what they added to Black Mesa, female scientists, security guards that aren't just Barneys, parts of levels redesigned to make more sense. I did encounter a few bugs, but it is still in Early Access. Early in the game, a security guard said "here let me open this gate for you!" he then walked through the gate and back, and it was still locked. Then about a minute later he opened it. Later in the game a ladder fell on me and i got stuck, but that's not really a big deal. My only other complaint is that a lot of the time I couldn't figure out where to go, I beat Half-Life when I was 14 and I don't remember ever getting stuck, I don't know if it's how they redesigned the levels; maybe I just suck more at games now than when I was a kid lol. The graphics are great, it uses a newer version of the Source engine. I also liked the original sound track a lot. One thing I think they could add is the Hazard Course, I thought that was a a good tutorial in the original game it would be cool to see that added. Breaking boxes with the crowbar never gets old, and I felt like I was 14 playing Half-Life again. I'm looking forward to when they finish the Xen part of the game. 9/10 Coop coins.","June 17, 2015","true","21.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

I understand it's Half Life, the multiple award winning game etc etc but that won't stop me from criticizing it\n- Crude animations\n\nOverall,this is a meh game. The pros and the cons is balanced for me and I got bored to play this game after a couple of hours. I meant no offense for the half life fans. I know that they're trying to revive an old game by combining it with the 21st century gaming technology but I do think they need to do more to attract more people than just half life fans and 20 year old guys trying to replay their childhood memories.Of course,not all of the current players are either of them and I don't know they are successful statistically or not. I would still recommend this game even if you are not a half life fan. It's still worth the price.","May 27, 2015","true","7.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

Probably without some features which are only available in the retail version.\nExample: There seems to be also a multiplayer but I am not that interested in it yet.\nHowever, the campaign is as good as it was in the year 1998. Just with better graphics, a few additions but also a few reductions.\nNothing which matters in such a bad way to give this game bad credit.\n\nI don't know why there are people who complain about that remake, but they probably overestimate their own opinion.\nAs for an EA game it works flawless and I am looking forward to further content arriving (especially the final release of Xen).\nIf people want to have a similar experience without the need to pay they should stick with the mod and calm down.\n\n\n\nOk...\nDas Wichtigste zuerst: Ich habe Half-Life damals auf meiner PS2 gespielt und ebenfalls die Decay-Missionen zu 100% abgeschlossen, um die geheime Vortigaunt-Mission freizuschalten.\nDanach kaufte ich mir Half-Life 2 für PC und in dem Paket war ebenfalls eine Gratiskopie von Half-Life: Source enthalten, was ich ebenfalls wieder spielte.\nAlso kenne ich die alten Versionen sehr gut...\n\nUnd ich kann nur sagen, dass man Remakes genauso machen sollte: Neue Grafik, altes Gameplay.\nGanz nach dem Motto: Ändere niemals ein funktionierendes System.\n\nZuvor spielte ich die Mod anno 2012 und ich kann nichts Schlechtes an diesem EA-Titel erkennen, außer, dass man ebenfalls in der Lage ist das Spiel gratis eben als Source-Mod zu erhalten. Selbstverständlich fehlen einige Features der Verkaufsversion.\nBeispiel: Es gibt auch einen Multiplayer, an dem ich jetzt aber nicht so interessiert bin.\nWie auch immer, die Kampagne ist genausogut wie damals 1998 nur eben mit besserer Grafik und einigen Erweiterungen, aber auch Einsparungen.\nNichts was grob ins Gewicht fallen würde.\n\nIch weiß nicht warum manche Spieler sich so sehr über dieses Remake aufregen, aber wahrscheinlich überschätzen sie nur ihre eigene Meinung.\nFür ein Early Access-Spiel funktioniert es makellos und ich freue mich auf die kommenden Inhalte (speziell auf den vollständigen Release der Xen-Episoden).\nWenn Leute eine ähnliche Erfahrung machen möchte, ohne etwas dafür zu zahlen sollen sie bei der Mod bleiben und sich beruhigen.","May 11, 2015","true","60.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

They are beautiful, I mean it.\nThe textures are all so high-res it is stunning. The normal maps applied especially.\nThe sounds is what has a very important impact in the game, without them the game wouldn't be so sweet!\nI can continue on, but I'd have to include the level design, animations, everything.\n\nWorth the money?\nIf you love the work of Crowbar Collective - hell it is.

The level designs are breath taking compared to the level design of the original, though there were some parts that made me rage a little bit, but those were just hard sections no bugs or anything. Graphics look downright beautiful, playing on a 144Hz monitor, turning all of the settings to the max including AA is a very exhilarating experience. Gameplay wise there are levels that are even harder than the singleplayer of the original half-life, I don't want to spoil them to the players that are going to play this game in the near future, I'm just letting you guys take note that this game is quite a challenge. I will say that the MP5 is a lot more accurate than the MP5/M16 in the original half-life so that's less of a challenge on that part of the game. A huge majority of the sound effects are brand new and not from the original Half-life, the sound effects do sound great when compared to the graphics(which are really well made from the Source engine.) Overall this is a very brilliant recreation of the insta-classic Half-life, If you're even on the slightest side of being a Half-life fan then i would highly recommend playing this game, you won't be disappointed. If you're a huge Half-life fan like i personally am, just buy the game without even thinking about it. really enjoying this so far and I can't wait until the developers are finished with the Xen related chapters.

This January I decided to play through it from start to finish, and I was both positively and negatively surprised.\n\nStarting with the good parts: obviously, the graphics have been improved a lot.  At times the game is even beautiful to look at.  I found the level design quite nice while still staying close to that of the original.  I can't say which ones I liked more, but some of the "puzzles" had been slightly altered compared to HL1; mostly they had a more HL2-ey feel to them.  The sound track is absolutely phenomenal.\n\nAs for the bad parts..  The game is still really buggy.  Two or three of the weapons didn't seem to be working correctly -- one of them was bad enough that it was completely unusable in the game thanks to its unreliability, and even caused a couple of crashes until I figured out how to avoid them.  The scopes in the revolver and the crossbow zoom in and out so slowly that you'll simply die before you get a chance to adjust your aim, and sometimes they just do something completely wacko.  There doesn't seem to be a way to walk without crouching if "Always Run" is on.  The AI sometimes completely stops working (e.g. Vortigaunts just staring at you), and even when it is working, it's sometimes bad enough that it can be abused for cheap kills (for example, an Alien Grunt can be killed at melee range with the SMG without taking any damage).  The list goes on and on and on.\n\nAside from all the bugs, the number of additional revolver magazines you're allowed to carry was brought down from five to two, which I thought really hurt my ability to clear bunkers stationed at open or semi-open areas, especially since there didn't seem to be a lot of hand grenades available.  A similar treatment was given to crossbows: you're only allowed to carry around two extra magazines (down from nine), and gravity now affects your bolts, which makes long-distance shots a lot more difficult.  Perhaps a change here was in order compared to the original, but I found myself with practically no means to clear bunkers several times over the course of the game.  The Glock is still for some reason really accurate at long distances, so by repeatedly peeking from behind a wall I could kill soldiers from long distances without taking too much damage.  I'm simultaneously both sad that that worked as well as it did, and that it was necessary due to poor balancing of the other long range weapons.\n\nAt times I thought the level design had not been tested well enough.  Several times when I was lost I managed to find my way into a dead end from which I could not get back (up, usually).  I'm generally terrible at knowing where to go in games, but it's even worse if there's absolutely no way to get back to the "intended" route, short of loading an earlier save.  But I'm not sure whether these are problems specific to Black Mesa, or if the original game had the same shortcomings as well.\n\nThe way the (currently) final boss in the game played out was really boring.  This coupled with the fact that there's no Xen at all, I was really disappointed in the end.\n\nAll in all, it was an enjoyable experience, but I'd wait a few more months for the bugs to be fixed and Xen to be added, and maybe pick the game up from the Summer Sales.  If you're a fan of the original Half-Life, it's still a great way to re-live the old game in a (very) slightly different package.  If you didn't get to enjoy the original Half-Life (or you're just not feeling nostalgic), I'd suggest looking at Half-Life 2 instead.","January 7","true","12.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

So with me completeing the game, I can now give my thoughts about the game, But I'll just do pro's and con's.\n\nPROS:-The game almost feels like it was made by valve, so a fantastic job to 'Crowbar Collective'!\n-The atmosphere and environment of the game is absolutely stunning and perfect!\n-They removed some of the parts of the original Half-life that was very annoying to get through, which is great!\n-The sounds, and the visuals is top-notch!\n-This is a very good game to start on if you are interested in playing the Half-life series!\n-With 16 hours of gamplay, I was not at one point bored or uninterested in the current situation of the game.\n\nCONS:-The voice acting was good, but it's like every scientist I would walk to, they all had the same voice actor, which was just a bit odd at times. Same for the security guards/police. Hearing the same voices kind of made the game feel repititive.\n-The levels where you go to the alien's planet is completely removed/not added to the game, resulting in entering the teleporter, it ends the game. I think its kind of unacceptable for them to take this long to develop those final levels, but when they are finished, they better be good!\n\nSo thats the pros and cons of the game. I'll be honest, after beating Black Mesa, the old love I had for Half-life had came back. Its a shame that Half-Life 3 to this day still isn't even confirmed. Either way though, Black Mesa remasters Half-Life in just the right way, which my final score will be:\n\n8/10 (It could be a 9/10 if the Xen levels could come sooner)","December 27, 2015","true","16.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

There are many places in many maps in the new version that seem reachable, but are not reachable either due to invisible walls or unimplemented physics for ladders.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wraggle/recommended/362890/","wraggle","Wraggle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wraggle/","188 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBlack Mesa is a modern remake of Half-Life, which started out as an ambitious mod and has been released as a fully fledged, standalone game, Currently in Early Access the developers have committed to continued support and bringing the final Xen levels that were missing from the mod. As it is set before Half-Life 2, Black Mesa follows the events that occurred to bring the Combine to Earth in the second game. It is part horror and part full blown action.\n\nBlack Mesa, as a mod, always had a rough ride in getting over the final hurdle. Changes in engine, team members, and the sheer pace in which modern games have evolved makes it an accomplishment that the mod was released and for free. They have now released their game on Steam and with a deathmatch component which is hoping to bring new players a small slice of what Half-Life Deathmatch was like. The retail version is running on a hybrid of Source engines so contains changes that aren't backwards compatible with the mod version. Most of the changes are subtle improvements in lighting, more stability and bugfixes, but also integration with Steamworks. Already there are new DM maps and mods for Black Mesa in the Steam Workshop which add to the experience.\n\nBlack Mesa is pretty comparible to other retail games. It has a good level of polish overall but has a few odd blemishes along the way. I think it is safe to say the Black Mesa, as the title suggests, is about the facility. The level of detail and focus put on the actual environment is very impressive. The machinery and laboritories are the best elements of the game. There is some equipment which is expertly modeled. When you see it in motion with the sound effects it is quite a sight. Overall the sound design is good, voice acting is well done with improvements to the HECU (marines) but there are some voices that are out of place. In some places Black Mesa also feels deathly quiet or slightly muffled with only an air con unit humming or a distant thumping. In Half-Life, sound was used to announce danger, so the HECU would be overly loud on their radios or the Vortigaunts would be gargling away. Yes, in Half-Life it was over the top but it made the game feel punchy. In places Black Mesa has no impact and I think it is down to the sound.\n\nThe AI have been reworked since the mod, so no more HECU soldiers sniping you with aimbot machine guns, and the aliens attacks have a bit more delay to them. However the developers seemed to have dialed them down too much to the point where the soldiers are almost pacifistic at times. They seemed to be scripted to hold back or huddle up. Some encounters I've seen them run back and forth between a rock and concrete block whilst I stood doing nothing. It is jarring and some battles become a duck shoot. The AI needs more work as it has turned the alien grunts and HECU into slightly timid enemies when they should be threats. On the other hand the assassins in game are agile but cause too much damage. This is being addressed by the developers but the levels with those enemies are almost unplayable. Its a shame as the enemy AI overall ranges from good (houndeyes and bullsquids) to bad (Ichthyosaur and alien grunts).\n\nThe set pieces in the game are still enjoyable and some are better than Half-Life. Most of the unforgiving insta-death moments in Half-Life are gone, but Black Mesa is still a lethal trial and error game in places. The On a Rail chapter is no longer a winding maze of rails and the Questionable Ethics and Lambda Core levels are really well done. Its a bit strange that with these improvements levels such as Residual Processing is still a bore and riding conveyor belts around with steep falls is plainly not fun. Surface Tension is also cut down so there is no sense of retreat by the HECU.\n\nDeathmatch is in its early stages but a fun, chaotic, game which is more closer to HL2:DM than HL:DM. Olders players are complaining of the reduced movement but for me it is a fun distraction for a hour or two. Weapons are all solid and meaty and using the experimental weapons is still a lot of fun. Its death match so takes a lot of practice before you feel any ounce of skill.\n\nHow you view the entire package falls down if you have followed the development or not. If you have followed the project for a long time and want to award the devs for releasing the mod for free, then buy it on Steam. If you have been following the project and just want to play Xen then for now stick to the free mod version and wait. If you have not followed the project then I would suggest trying the free version for now as this is still being worked on.\n\nI would recommend it based on the quality of other released games, however it is not Half Life, and needs tweaking. Let it mature a bit. The developers are still working on upgrading textures, tweaking multi-player and eventually bringing out Xen. I think it will be a few more years but hopefully a small monetary incentive will help them.","May 17, 2015","true","37.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is an amazing remake of the game that revolutionized the first person genre: Half Life. The game improves further on some aspects that weren’t even accessible back in the days which makes the story even more immersive. The game is completely cannon and adds some characters that are crucial to the Half Life Universe which weren’t in the first game. When Valve asked them to take the mod a step further and create a full retain copy I got super exited. They have not let me down, lots of improvements have been made to make this the remake it deserves to be. Better voice acting than the mod, new improved visuals and to top it all of a full Multiplayer Deathmatch.\n\nMore is coming though, Xen and as far as I heard they are experimenting with a CTF gamemode.\n\nAbsolutely a must have!\n\n\n","May 11, 2015","true","63.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wraggle/recommended/362890/","wraggle","Wraggle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wraggle/","188 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBlack Mesa is a modern remake of Half-Life, which started out as an ambitious mod and has been released as a fully fledged, standalone game, Currently in Early Access the developers have committed to continued support and bringing the final Xen levels that were missing from the mod. As it is set before Half-Life 2, Black Mesa follows the events that occurred to bring the Combine to Earth in the second game. It is part horror and part full blown action.\n\nBlack Mesa, as a mod, always had a rough ride in getting over the final hurdle. Changes in engine, team members, and the sheer pace in which modern games have evolved makes it an accomplishment that the mod was released and for free. They have now released their game on Steam and with a deathmatch component which is hoping to bring new players a small slice of what Half-Life Deathmatch was like. The retail version is running on a hybrid of Source engines so contains changes that aren't backwards compatible with the mod version. Most of the changes are subtle improvements in lighting, more stability and bugfixes, but also integration with Steamworks. Already there are new DM maps and mods for Black Mesa in the Steam Workshop which add to the experience.\n\nBlack Mesa is pretty comparible to other retail games. It has a good level of polish overall but has a few odd blemishes along the way. I think it is safe to say the Black Mesa, as the title suggests, is about the facility. The level of detail and focus put on the actual environment is very impressive. The machinery and laboritories are the best elements of the game. There is some equipment which is expertly modeled. When you see it in motion with the sound effects it is quite a sight. Overall the sound design is good, voice acting is well done with improvements to the HECU (marines) but there are some voices that are out of place. In some places Black Mesa also feels deathly quiet or slightly muffled with only an air con unit humming or a distant thumping. In Half-Life, sound was used to announce danger, so the HECU would be overly loud on their radios or the Vortigaunts would be gargling away. Yes, in Half-Life it was over the top but it made the game feel punchy. In places Black Mesa has no impact and I think it is down to the sound.\n\nThe AI have been reworked since the mod, so no more HECU soldiers sniping you with aimbot machine guns, and the aliens attacks have a bit more delay to them. However the developers seemed to have dialed them down too much to the point where the soldiers are almost pacifistic at times. They seemed to be scripted to hold back or huddle up. Some encounters I've seen them run back and forth between a rock and concrete block whilst I stood doing nothing. It is jarring and some battles become a duck shoot. The AI needs more work as it has turned the alien grunts and HECU into slightly timid enemies when they should be threats. On the other hand the assassins in game are agile but cause too much damage. This is being addressed by the developers but the levels with those enemies are almost unplayable. Its a shame as the enemy AI overall ranges from good (houndeyes and bullsquids) to bad (Ichthyosaur and alien grunts).\n\nThe set pieces in the game are still enjoyable and some are better than Half-Life. Most of the unforgiving insta-death moments in Half-Life are gone, but Black Mesa is still a lethal trial and error game in places. The On a Rail chapter is no longer a winding maze of rails and the Questionable Ethics and Lambda Core levels are really well done. Its a bit strange that with these improvements levels such as Residual Processing is still a bore and riding conveyor belts around with steep falls is plainly not fun. Surface Tension is also cut down so there is no sense of retreat by the HECU.\n\nDeathmatch is in its early stages but a fun, chaotic, game which is more closer to HL2:DM than HL:DM. Olders players are complaining of the reduced movement but for me it is a fun distraction for a hour or two. Weapons are all solid and meaty and using the experimental weapons is still a lot of fun.

Until my energy collapsed :P\n\nWell, where can I start?\nBlack Mesa is a remaster of Half-Life 1, the first game of the Half-Life franchise, made by Valve.\nNot only a graphics remaster but a complete mechanics remaster, for those who don't know, Black Mesa, is a graphical/mechanical remasterization for HL 1.\n\nIt occurs in Texas, 1999 in the Black Mesa facility (oh, don't you say that, Sherlock) where a scientist named Gordon Freeman is about to test a new machine for his fellow scientists partners. I can't say more about the start because... It will be a huge spoiler and nobody likes that...\n\nAfter a long while playing the free demo (a.k.a. not updated test version) version, I saw a lot of glitches, triggers you could walk past without activating them and... Buggy weapons... Of course there will be lots of bugs on the Demo (a.k.a NUTV (let's call it like that)) and it was a testing version "leaked" for people to play and try the new mechanics.\n\nWell, after 9 years of devel-\nNo, it's not my script...\n\nAfter 8.6 hours of gameplay, I can say that the game itself is pretty good, they fixed lots of bugs that were in the Demo and made some "passed by-able" (idk, don't ask, Im Brazilian, don't force me to speak perfect english :P) triggers bigger, so the player can't actually continue the game without activating them. Some of them were "NPC A.I. Activator" if I can call it like that, that made the game a little easy for players to speed run, I don't blame speed runners, I like it and I think I'll try it some day.\nPros.:Nice graphics\nNice mechanics\nAnnoying bugs were fixed from Half-Life 1\nThey HAVE a full game demo for players to test and approve/disapprove their game\nThe gameplay is awesome and immersiveCons.:Still a bit buggy (Early Acess Review, remember!)\nYou can still pass by some triggers without activating it\nThere is no Xen yet, yep...

This game is an example of a passion project by developers that simply won't quit until they accomplish the goals they set out to achieve.\n\nIt's a rich, detailed world they've created with the source engine, taking all the excitement and wonder of the original and turning the volume up to 11 with excellent level design and (mostly) clean crisp textures.\n\nThere are a lot of entitled people on the internet, people who will pay 60 dollars for their third copy of GTA 5 and pay a monthly fee for world of warcraft, but give them a total conversion for half-life 2 that reproduces the joy of the original half life for 1/3 the cost of a triple A title that also boasts a solid multiplayer experience?

I never played the first one, and I was unable to complete the second.\n\nThat being said, I've enjoyed alot of Black Mesa so far. The cast of characters are helpful and informative, giving the player incentive to save as many people as possible. They also engage in dialogue, and occasionally, the things they say to each other are profound and believable. The hard difficulty provides enough of a challenge without being too difficult. The enemies are tough, yet fair. The atmosphere and level design is reminicent of Bioshock (another game I hold dear).\n\nAlthough I've given Black Mesa alot of praise, that does not mean it is without flaws. I ran into a couple of issues; the Vorts' AI seem to be broken during the Office Complex chapter (which I tested multiple times), the last few chapters are still in development, and occasionally, the HECU marine does not drop the shotgun like he is suppose to.\n\nOverall, I LOVE this game, but I do not think it is worth the full price in it's current state.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iSunsetQuesadilla/recommended/362890/","iSunsetQuesadilla","iSunsetQuesadilla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iSunsetQuesadilla/","66 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is just... unbelievable.\n\nFor those who don't want to read this really long review, just here are my quick thoughts: It's amazing; the graphics are amazing, the music is amazing, and the gameplay is amazing. It's worth every f***ing cent. Buy it right now.\n\nNow for those who have nothing better to do with their time:\n\nI first came in contact with the game back in 2008 when my sister's boyfriend talked to the both of us about it. I had become a fan of Half-Life already when I first saw Freeman's Mind and gradually became more and more addicted to the franchise as a whole. So, when I saw Black Mesa, I got really damn pumped, anxiously waiting for the 2009 release. Of course, as you now know, there were tons of delays. So many to the point that I thought the project would never get released. I came back and left and came back and left when looking at updates. I still was an avid fan and hoped for the better. It came as a shock to my friend and I when the original mod was released via Gamefront back in 2012, released at 8:47 A.M. mountain time. Now that's awesome.\n\nThis version on Steam is an Early-access version of the game that is recieving updates constantly and is yet to recieve the remaining Xen chapters. But from what I have played now for hours and hours, I can give my final thoughts. I don't even care of the Xen parts are crap, which I know they won't be, because as I fan and a critic, I can safely say this about the game:\n\nIt is better than the original Half-Life in every single way and is almost better than Half-Life 2 in some aspects. This is one of the best games I have played in years. It's hard to know where to start when analyzing this masterpiece but by just going through the basics, I guess. The level structures are beyond impressive. There was a lot of time and hard effort put into making this a realistic looking game and giving it a very, and again I say, realisitc look. The original game, because of its graphical limitations, wasn't that detailed, and thus, maps for levels were very blocky and designed in a linear manner. That made this Black Mesa facility look laughingly built like just a video game level. It kind of takes you out of the experience if you think about it. Black Mesa here on the other hand, adds lots of extra rooms, more details, extra desks in understandable locations, and objects that fit in certain locations. It is a gorgeous looking game, to say the least. I wish I could post screenshots here for examples.\n\nSo the level design is beyond outstanding. One of the best looking games out there, far better than Half-Life 2. The gameplay hasn't been altered much, but new HUD effects and animations for the guns have made the shooting action seem different from all other titles in the franchise. The weapons have a lot of good weight to them. You really feel like you're doing damage to the environment around you and the enemies you encounter along the way. However, there is a lot of hidden stuff and optional actions for the players to partake in that really add to the atmosphere of the game. While there was some of this in the original Half-Life, much more has been added into this game. For example, in the chapter "Anamolous Materials", all you HAVE to do is grab your H.E.V. suit and go down to the test chamber. You can though listen to other people's conversations, which some of them go on for a very long time, hand toilet paper to a struggling man in the bathroom, cause disruptions during other people's work, and so on. In the third chapter, after the resonance cascade, you can have a security guard follow you back up to the front office you started in the previous chapter. However, here when the guard reaches the desk, he tries to phone for help and you can stand there watching him. Him desperately calling and no one responding at all really adds to the dark tone of the game, reinforcing the idea that you are alone in this dark place. It almost reminds of the movie "Alien" at times.\n\nAtmosphere, level structure, and gameplay are nailed perfectly. Not a single flaw I can find in those categories. But now comes onto the positive and negatives of the sound. The only places I can find flaws in at the moment in this whole game, besides some parts of multiplayer, are the sound. All physics and movement sound effects are perfect. There are thousands of sounds that correctly correspond to certain environments you travel through. Weapon noises are perfect in a sense they carry this heavy feel to them. The magnum in particular is my favorite. And I think I should address one of my favorite aspects of the game besides the graphics... the music... Joel Nielsen... thank you... seriously... I adore this soundtrack. Every single track is beyond perfection. Surface Tension 2 and Questionable Ethics 1 are some of the best pieces of video game score I have ever heard in my entire life. I've been having those specific tracks loop as I write this review. They are that amazing. So, the score is obviously a must buy. Like, go buy this soundtrack. It's worth the money. But now, there are the negatives to the sound. The voice acting is passable, but it needs a lot of improvement. Now, I'm not going to hold much against a very small team that spent many years developing a game that was original going to just be free. The voice acting is good for a mod. The problem is now this is being sold as a normal game. It's not a big problem or anything, it's just a lot of the line deliviries are very cheesy. Moments that are supposed to be very dramatic and terrifying are made kind of funny because of the way some of these actors bring out their voice. It distracts from the horrific scenes that take place in the visuals. So, the only thing I suggest for the sound is: before the Early-access label is taken down and the game is fully released, re-record the voices. Trust me, I think it would help the game just a little bit.\n\nSo that about covers it for the core aspects of the game. Just to recap, the graphics are beautiful, the sound is stellar, the gameplay is mesmerizing, and the overall structure of the levels shows impeccable work. The core game is one of the best games I have ever played. Right now, I'd say go buy it... and... yeah, go f**king buy it. Stop reading this and buy it! These people deserve your money. They worked very hard and spent 10 years of their lives to get this project completed. They deserve this reward and recognition. I might update my review once the Xen levels come out, but I doubt I'll need to, unless they're bad and I need to deduct points, but even then I won't.\n\nI love this game. I really love it. It's one of my favorite games of all time now. Valve, if you're reading this, please hire these guys. If you have already, then I say thank you.\n\nThis gets an A+ ...\n\n\n\nWhy are you still here? They're waiting for you... in the test chamber...","June 9, 2015","true","68.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I did not think it would actually be completed or released, let alone be such a loving, faithful homage to the original.\n\nLet's be honest: Half-Life set the bar for a lot of things in its time but it hasn't aged well. The environments don't make much sense, enemy behaviour is erratic and there are only 4 scientists.\n\nBlack Mesa updates Half-Life, bringing in all the necessary 21st century sensibilities that the original lacked. At this point, if a friend of mine told me they wanted to start playing the Half-Life games, I'd tell them to start with Black Mesa and simply ignore the original. It is historically important, sure, but for the modern games BM is much more suitable (and less likely to drive them away from this classic series).\n\nI can offer no higher praise for this game (I can't call it a "mod" in good conscience) than to say it  And has surpassed its predecessor.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_solios/recommended/362890/","_solios","solios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_solios/","134 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe paid Steam release is the free release from a couple of years back with a number of jaw-dropping improvements to visual fidelity.... and a number of bugs the old free release didn't have, mostly relating to NPC meshes and quickloading so if you're one of those 1377d3wdz who plays on hard and hasn't died in an FPS since 1998 you'll never have most of the problems I experienced with the game.  The reflection mapping is cute but the fact that the player character does not reflect gave me a headache at first, as my art-brain was strenuously offended by such a glaring omission - though the PC does not "exist" in most FPS in any meaningful way and that's entirely consistent with the original Half-Life.  As of May 2015 the developers seem to be focused on multiplayer so if you want the final act of the story you'll still need to play Half-Life: Source or the original Half-Life.\n\nFeature-wise, the game would benefit enormously from some very un-Half-Life FPS luxuries such as leaning, a melee function that is detached from weapon select (see: the Metro games, Bioshock: Infinite, Borderlands), and maybe a shorter grenade chucking distance.  It feels like the shotgun is way off from the previous release, the Source version, HL2, etc - damage is light and the spread is tight.  In point of fact the shotgun handles less like a shotgun and more like a weaker, slower, range-limited revolver with a spread that feels about as wide as the MP5.  Marines are hyper-vigilant and very aggressive, with long sight lines and instant reflexes - the crossbow is only useful at range if the target is completely oblivious; otherwise they dodge the bolt long before it can strike.  Other reviews critical of Marine AI (and AI in general) provide more and more accurate information about NPC behavior - it's changed from the previous release and in my opinion not for the better.  I found sniping by selecting the .357, sighting with the Z key then releasing Z and pressing fire at the same time to be much more effective than the crossbow - everything can and does duck bolts but I have yet to encounter an NPC that can duck a properly aimed bullet.  I did not find single player combat satisfying but I'm used to different games and I'm mentally comparing the experience to Half-Life 2, Half-Life: Source, and the previous Black Mesa release - all of which seem a bit more forgiving by comparison.\n\nI bought this game for two reasons - to give the devs some money in exchange for the enjoyment I gleaned from the free release, and to rack up a bunch of achievements in a game world I was already familiar with.  I have not played multiplayer and do not plan to; I consider the fact that the current release does not have multiplayer achievements to be a feature and wish more story-centric games would structure their achievements similarly.\n\nRecommended if you like the Half-Life games and haven't played it yet.  If you didn't like Half-Life this game isn't going to change your mind, though the modern visuals might make a convincing argument.\n\nI'll try for the "Rare Specimen" achievement in the final release.","May 20, 2015","true","16.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This is not only a competent shooter, but one of the best in it's field.  Though not the prettiest shooter nor the most modern, it is extremely well put together, it handles magnificently, it has wonderful ideas (both from Valve's original and from the dev team), it's very well-characterized and it's one of the keystones of gaming upon which an era was founded.  You might not know it, but you probably need this game in your life.\n\n"Is it worth shelling out $20 when the mod is free?"\nIn every respect, absolutely.

Some little things have been changed as far as I have seen and little touches of detail. For example, when you enter the locker room in Anomalous Materials and when you get the HEV suit, it feels like you are actually putting on a helmet. HUD display, code display and etc. It's difficult to explain that, you'll have to see it for yourself. Animations have been changed, which is a nice touch to be honest. Another example of this is when you run with certain weapons, you lower them down and literally start waving it around as you run around. It looks like you are actually sprinting, as opposed to the mod version, where you lowered your weapon when you started sprinting.\nThe game is also now using a modified variant of SDK, which has better lighting, textures and  more.\nThe absence of Xen is still, odd, considering the time they had after releasing the free version, but we can wait for that, right? Textures have been updated and I believe that some parts of the map have also been updated, if I saw it correctly.\n\nThe biggest difference between this and the mod, is it's feature of Multiplayer. I haven't given it much of a go myself currently, I'm pretty bad at PvP combat. There are quite a amount of people usually online on MP as I've seen on servers which have dm_undertow.\nA big difference also added on this version is the support of modding, as seen by the addition of the Workshop. We will hopefully see many good releases on there, maybe even as far as big single-player maps. eh?\n\nIt's quite an amazing feeling coming to this game, especially after the wait of 6 years that I had went over, and not to mention the time that I've been waiting to get my hands on this version.\nIf you want to support the developers who have given their time and effort, and by that I mean some serious effort, you should most definitely buy the game. I've also heard that some developers had quit their jobs to work full-time on this. That could be a rumour so don't take that for granted.\n\nOver all, it being in Early-Access might be a disgust to some people, but maybe the devs need the dolla' to hire artists and people to finish Xen, that is possible, it's still worth buying. I see good things for the future of this game, considering the added Multiplayer and Workshop. If you have the spare money, give this game a go. If you aren't sure to either buy the game or to play the free version, the free version is still avaliable, at the time of writing.","May 5, 2015","true","5.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","53"

I LOVE this mod, not because it simply updates the old Half-Life game...\n\nNo, this mod retells the story that Valve first told decades ago in the late 90s, much better, ironically, than they ever could have done. You don't play through the Black Mesa Incident anymore, you live through it. You don't simply stroll on in late to work, you stop and talk to people who know and work with you every day, people who all have their own relationships with you...\n\nWhich makes it all the more hard-hitting when the Resonance Cascade hits, and hits hard at that, and you are left to piece together what happened from the ashes not only your home, but the homes of many others. This is not a Half-Life remake, this is quite simply, what Half-Life is.\n\nNow that my gushing over this amazing mod is out of the way, I'd like to take a moment to address the "controversy" over this being a paid mod. Not a few weeks ago, the whole Skyrim Workshop debacle got me just as ruffled up as anyone else. It was a very flawed system, and I did everything I could to help contribute to getting the system removed. That said, BLACK MESA IS NOT WORKSHOPGATE 2.0!\n\nFor one, they've said for at least a year now that they would have a paid version on Steam, so it shouldn't be surprising to anyone who's actually followed the mod. Also, you can still get the mod for free off their site. Finally, this game, and its very talented development team, deserves to be paid for. Not only has the Crowbar Collective matched Valve's quality, it has surpassed it. For years, this team has worked on this mod to retell one of the most influential stories in gaming's history, and in my opinion, their work is more than worthy of my hard-earned cash.\n\nAlso, if you haven't gathered this so far, the Crowbar Collective isn't some team of chuckles that simply makes mods, they put love and effort into their work. Yes, they may not work as fast as we want at times (believe me, two years of waiting to see this mod finally up showed me that much), but they deliver something that is worth the wait.\n\nSo, now that my review is done, all I can say is good work Crowbar Collective, and I recommend that any person who enjoys the Half-Life series, mods, First-Person Shooters, or video games in general give this mod a shot. You don't have to buy it immediately, you can check out the free version, which does a great job of showing off the mod. Then, if you're like me, and believe the Collective is worthy, you can give the team a bit of your cash for their well-done work.\n\n10/10 Crowbar Collective, Black Mesa has always been, and I anticipate will always be, one of the shining beacons of what modding can be.","May 8, 2015","true","21.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have to say i was quite impressed. At first I was hesitant due to being a 20$ price on it, so i went through the reviews, weighing the pro's and con's then realized something. This 20$ goes to time spent plus helping the developers be able to focus on the game. SO I hope they complete the final chapter. So it took me 10 hours of play to get through it. I died a LOT. With the way the AI is writting, cannot just go out guns blazing dodging left/right taking cover here and there. I found myself taking cover and waiting for them to come to me as the game progressed.\n\nWith HL, it was easy to get through the levels and figure out the path to take or solve the puzzle. WIth Black Mesa it wasnt so obvious, due to how detailed the game is, so the answer just doesnt "stand out".\n\nThere were moments im going to go back and play through, IE: finding the alternte route to the office.\n\n\nPro's\n- 8 hours spent in story, 2 on multiplayer.\n- Felt like I was always low on ammo.\n- Ditto for health\n- With the level of detail and extras they put in the game, i enjoyed just looking around and finding all the content they put in the game.\n- Do like the multiplayer, fast paced if you can get a server with 4 or more. SO do not need heck of a lot to keep ya on your toes.\n- Lot of moments where i got  frustrated but not enough to quit or question why to the game makers. Just made me try harder.\n- Really get to feel just how big this place is.\n\n\nCon's\n- Crobar hit, doesnt match with the swing.\n- The grenade physics, even when i try to adjust alwayseem to lob it where it bounces back at me.\n- Would like to see the AI take more team work approach to attacking, less run in balls deep.\n-- In addition, would like to see them try to Luer you out, IE: Throw grenade near where you are hiding. Currently they only seem to throw one if you stand in the open.\n- The ALT fire to the magnum to look down the barrel, covers up way to much, makes it harder to aim to be useful.\n- Even though there is a lot updated to visual can tell where they cut corners.... ie: on the breaker box, the level is still a retangle block.\n\n\nAll in all, its a great game, choose to spend the money the way you want to, but you will enjoy the game.\n","July 6, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Logan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cmdrlogan/","179 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is truly well worked on. The attention to detail, voice acting, textures, fidelity to the story line, as well as the overall construction is amazing. There are very few structural and object placement changes (I confess I was feeling really uncomfortable not having the legendary crowbar where it used to be in the original Half-Life. It can be found slightly farther ahead now, but it's enough to make old timers break a sweat).\n\nThe game, overall, is incredible. It is Half-Life after all, isn't it? I'll just point out a few of the bad points. Take these off and you have yourselves a must-have recreation:\n\n- I feel the hitboxes weren't thoroughly designed. Sometimes, a zombie will be able to hit you even if you're about 3 feet away from its reach, making crowbar fighting a quite tough experience; also, depending on the ongoing animation, clear headshots just won't register, and you'll find yourself wasting ammo that technically shouldn't have been wasted;\n\n- I'm not sure whether more finale options have been added to this, as I have only tried it once. But where the hell is the Xen world? If there is one, I didn't get to set foot in it. It is pretty disappointing, as it is a big part of the original game.\n\n- If you're reloading your shotgun from zero, make sure you switch weapons when you have 7 shells in. The pump action animation will invariably fire a round into whatever you're looking at. Switching weapons 'kills' the animation and prevents the accidental fire;\n\n- Iron sights only work in the .357. It is a plus, although I don't remember it being a thing in the original Half-Life. However, it is pretty buggy. At first, it'll only work like the zoom in Counter-Strike (as though your neck has stretched some painful 2 feet forward). After a few seconds, the gun will line up in center just fine. The problem is, when you're not aiming anymore, it'll stay there, blocking your view of potentially important things until it's reloaded or switched for another weapon.\n\nEither way, I'd totally recommend this revamped nostalgia streak for all veterans out there. Did I mention multiplayer is really fun?","May 26, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

After that there was so many cool mods, then we had Counter Strike, Steam, Portal, HL2, Source Engine and so many games related that changed and influenced the game industry forever, Half Life has much credit for that.\n\nBlack Mesa is a remake of the first Half-Life, made by a independent developer, and they did a incredible job. I played the free source version, but this is much improved. I read the reviews before buy and they are extremely positive but still the game exceed my expectations. They were very successful on preserve and improve the atmosphere and every thing that made HL so great, but still they improved so much the gameplay, puzzles and etc.  The Source physics are not only added, it really interact with the game.\n\nOf course it´s not flawless, we have some problems specially with NPC and AI, but still awesome to play, and as early access maybe we yet get some improvement.\n\nIt´s pretty much like Half-Life 2, but Black Mesa facilities have a unique feeling, once you get inside there you will never forget.","June 11, 2015","true","27.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of VALVe's world famous 'Half-Life' (1998), with updated visuals, graphics and physics gameplay updating to modern day requirements. Black Mesa still captures the excitement and isolation the Half-Life created and takes you round the old Half-Life scenes and encounters, as well as polishing them up to the best standards. The new weapon models (My favourite being the Tau cannon), the textures and new NPC models make Black Mesa seem almost like a window into reality compared to Half-Life's old graphics.\n\nOne of my personal favourites of the improvements was that the HECU Marines did not speak through Radio's, but instead spoke normally in their voices. This immedietly made me more immersed and empathetic towards them, as you could hear their emotions through their voices for the first time, ranging from determined and aggressive to terrified and nervous. They did not have the bad-guy, kill em' all tone that they had in Half-Life but are now showing a more Human side. This was so effective that I even felt sorry killing the marines!\n\nBlack Mesa has also included a multiplayer gamemode, which uses some of the old maps multiplayer maps from half life 2, such as Gasworks and re-imagines them like the rest of the game. The multiplayer itself is a fun, enjoyable experience which has sucked a lot of my time into it. The fact multiplayer has been revived and focused on in such detail shows the amount of work and consideration being put into this project.\n\nUnfortunately, the final Xen chapter is still going under development at crowbar collective. I predict that Xen will still have a while to go until it is ready for release. But the only possible outcome is that it will be outstanding and provide an excellent conclusion the this shining game. After all, the amount of work that was made to the main bulk of the game must surely tell us what Xen will be like!\n\nI did encounter a small jigglebone bug with the scientists' ties and the Tau cannon pipe. They spasmed manically all the time and made the game a little funny. However, this did not turn out to be a major problem, as the game is centered more on yourself and personal experience than the involvement of NPC's and the use of certain weapons.\n\nIn conclusion, I take my hat of to Crowbar Collective and the other Dev's that are taking the time and contribution to this game and the amazing improvements they have made. I wish them the best for their futures and I give them a very big Thank you!\n\n9.8/10\n","June 7, 2015","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have to say i was quite impressed. At first I was hesitant due to being a 20$ price on it, so i went through the reviews, weighing the pro's and con's then realized something. This 20$ goes to time spent plus helping the developers be able to focus on the game. SO I hope they complete the final chapter. So it took me 10 hours of play to get through it. I died a LOT. With the way the AI is writting, cannot just go out guns blazing dodging left/right taking cover here and there.

WIth Black Mesa it wasnt so obvious, due to how detailed the game is, so the answer just doesnt "stand out".\n\nThere were moments im going to go back and play through, IE: finding the alternte route to the office.\n\n\nPro's\n- 8 hours spent in story, 2 on multiplayer.\n- Felt like I was always low on ammo.\n- Ditto for health\n- With the level of detail and extras they put in the game, i enjoyed just looking around and finding all the content they put in the game.\n- Do like the multiplayer, fast paced if you can get a server with 4 or more. SO do not need heck of a lot to keep ya on your toes.\n- Lot of moments where i got  frustrated but not enough to quit or question why to the game makers. Just made me try harder.\n- Really get to feel just how big this place is.\n\n\nCon's\n- Crobar hit, doesnt match with the swing.\n- The grenade physics, even when i try to adjust alwayseem to lob it where it bounces back at me.\n- Would like to see the AI take more team work approach to attacking, less run in balls deep.\n-- In addition, would like to see them try to Luer you out, IE: Throw grenade near where you are hiding. Currently they only seem to throw one if you stand in the open.\n- The ALT fire to the magnum to look down the barrel, covers up way to much, makes it harder to aim to be useful.\n- Even though there is a lot updated to visual can tell where they cut corners.... ie: on the breaker box, the level is still a retangle block.\n\n\nAll in all, its a great game, choose to spend the money the way you want to, but you will enjoy the game.\n","July 6, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As it stands, it's not a mod. It's a full-on remake, and a damned good one at that. The level design stays fairly true to the original, but it takes some liberties that make use of the newer Source engine.\n\nI also had the opportunity to accidentally do a side-by-side test between a new PC and a 6 year old PC, since I just upgraded. Performance on the older computer was pretty good, with a few hiccups here and there (it was also running on an external drive, which undoubtedly impacted performance), and ran flawlessly on the new PC. Since the Source engine is older than that PC, that's probably to be expected.\n\nThe elephant in the room has to be the lack of a Xen chapter. I'm given to understanding that this is part of the reason it's in Early Access, which makes sense. They're also not discussing development of the chapter, so when it comes out it comes out, I suppose. As it stands, I recommend the game. I'll probably recommend it even more after Xen is released.","May 29, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After that there was so many cool mods, then we had Counter Strike, Steam, Portal, HL2, Source Engine and so many games related that changed and influenced the game industry forever, Half Life has much credit for that.\n\nBlack Mesa is a remake of the first Half-Life, made by a independent developer, and they did a incredible job. I played the free source version, but this is much improved. I read the reviews before buy and they are extremely positive but still the game exceed my expectations. They were very successful on preserve and improve the atmosphere and every thing that made HL so great, but still they improved so much the gameplay, puzzles and etc.  The Source physics are not only added, it really interact with the game.\n\nOf course it´s not flawless, we have some problems specially with NPC and AI, but still awesome to play, and as early access maybe we yet get some improvement.\n\nIt´s pretty much like Half-Life 2, but Black Mesa facilities have a unique feeling, once you get inside there you will never forget.","June 11, 2015","true","27.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Logan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cmdrlogan/","179 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is truly well worked on. The attention to detail, voice acting, textures, fidelity to the story line, as well as the overall construction is amazing. There are very few structural and object placement changes (I confess I was feeling really uncomfortable not having the legendary crowbar where it used to be in the original Half-Life. It can be found slightly farther ahead now, but it's enough to make old timers break a sweat).\n\nThe game, overall, is incredible. It is Half-Life after all, isn't it? I'll just point out a few of the bad points. Take these off and you have yourselves a must-have recreation:\n\n- I feel the hitboxes weren't thoroughly designed. Sometimes, a zombie will be able to hit you even if you're about 3 feet away from its reach, making crowbar fighting a quite tough experience; also, depending on the ongoing animation, clear headshots just won't register, and you'll find yourself wasting ammo that technically shouldn't have been wasted;\n\n- I'm not sure whether more finale options have been added to this, as I have only tried it once. But where the hell is the Xen world? If there is one, I didn't get to set foot in it. It is pretty disappointing, as it is a big part of the original game.\n\n- If you're reloading your shotgun from zero, make sure you switch weapons when you have 7 shells in. The pump action animation will invariably fire a round into whatever you're looking at. Switching weapons 'kills' the animation and prevents the accidental fire;\n\n- Iron sights only work in the .357. It is a plus, although I don't remember it being a thing in the original Half-Life. However, it is pretty buggy. At first, it'll only work like the zoom in Counter-Strike (as though your neck has stretched some painful 2 feet forward). After a few seconds, the gun will line up in center just fine. The problem is, when you're not aiming anymore, it'll stay there, blocking your view of potentially important things until it's reloaded or switched for another weapon.\n\nEither way, I'd totally recommend this revamped nostalgia streak for all veterans out there.

High graphical fidelity as well as gameplay that is similar to many shooter titles today.\n\nIs Black Mesa good? Yes, in fact I'd say that it's better than the original Half Life. There are a number of elements of Half Life which no longer hold up, most of which have been removed, reworked or reimagined entirely to fit in much better in the game. The attention to detail will make you remember the original Half Life in a more favourable way. I have only one complaint, that Residue Processing is still as horrible with its platforming as ever, that's it. Surface Tension is however much better in execution. Tanks are mobile, appear 3 times and have a much more challenging AI. Infantry Fighting Vehicles also debut, but appear once. Snipers are better and are modified versions of the Combine snipers of HL2.\nAs far as I can tell, gameplay is enhanced and that elements from HL2 gameplay is adapted while staying true to the original HL gameplay.\n\nXen is missing from the game at time of writing this review. Apparently the plan is to totally overhaul the Xen levels in order to make them more playable and provide a superior player experience.\n\nThe game up until that point is very much polished. There is very little to fault the game with. Perhaps a lack of voice actors (I suspect something like 6 were used). The player is also sometimes prone to getting stuck in invisible objects (time to brush up on console commands and noclip) but now I'm nitpicking.\n\nI recommend Black Mesa for all those who played the original Half Life and want to relive the game with modern graphics and modern gameplay. I also recommend Black Mesa to those who have never played Half Life. It permits players to experience the original game with the original plot line, but experience it in a modern way in line with many other games released today.","June 26, 2015","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The HDR lighting is beautiful, the art assets look better than Half-Life 2, combat feels much better, and the new Soundtrack is great (it gives chapters like Blast Pit a whole different feel).\n\nOn top of that, there's lots of extra ties and references to future Half-Life games, and the dev team themselves. Clearly a lot of love and attention to detail went into development, and the result is a mod that plays better than most AAA games.\n\nNOTE: This is indeed still early access.

Also hope the future will bring more players in the multiplayer part.\n\nI will rate the singleplayer part: 1337/10\nAnd the multiplayer part, that still needs some polish and tweak, and more players: 6/10","January 2","true","11.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Xen is not in the game yet. But it will probably be added sometimes Early 2016. I don't know really. So some of the levels you might remember from the original Half-Life, some might seem a bit different. THe single-player is a good 10 hour long. It's amazing. 9/10 ( No Xen yet ;( )\n\nMultiplayer will be a bit more awesome if they added a few gamemodes, not just run and gun. But the multiplayer is also amazing. Recommended for any Half-Life fan. :)\n\n9/10 ( No Xen yet ;( )","December 29, 2015","true","14.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Crowbar Collective has done a FINE job re-making this classic into a new classic for the current generation of gamers to experience, and for us vets to experience agan for the first time. It is not often a game is re-made by another team and turns out as great as this. I highly recommend this game to EVERYONE who has steam.

What they don't realize is that the mod is free for everyone, just go to their website. This is just the retail version.\nAnother thing fans don't like is that they stilll haven't had included Xen in. Which is understandable, although Xen was never a fan favourite location to begin with.\n"Early Access" is there for a reason, you don't like it, don't buy it.\n\nThey still have some improvements to make (more details down below) but you gotta appreciate the effort they put into remaking one of the best (FPS) titles out there.\n\nSome voice over still needs improvement (Eli Vance);\n\nThey sacrificed some elements people loved for the sake of realism, HECU Marines don't look like they did in Half-Life, instead they have been given more realistic appearances. Scientists and guards look like they've been based off the HD model pack, that one isn't that bad, can be fixed thanks to workshop. Would be nice to have the option in-game though;\n\nLoading screens are pretty damn long, though nobody can really blame the devs for that, that's more of the engine's problem. Possible Source 2 port in the future could fix that (though they said they probably won't do that);\n\nI might add more once I come up with some. If I missed anything, you can reply to it.\n\nEDIT: There was some criticism where they cut some parts out, but they added On A Rail: Uncut to the workshop and Surface Tension: Uncut in the game. Now there's still Xen...","January 5","true","71.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

That's really all that can be said about it in one sentence. However, it is much better than the official Source port of Half-Life. The developers hand-made each texture, voiced each character, and coded each segment. The only things the developers used that they didn't make were the plot and overall concept. My favorite part was, well, Black Mesa. I loved going into all of the new rooms and interacting with things and hearing all of the extra dialogue. After that, it's just Half-Life. If you've played it, you've pretty much played this. In my eyes that's a downfall, though not a very big one. If you have Half-Life: Source and wanted a REAL Source port, this is for you. I haven't played the multiplayer that much, but from what I've seen it's Deathmatch: Source, but again, actually in Source.\n\nI rate the game overall 9.5/10.","June 12, 2015","true","9.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","5","8","3","0"

I do like the original Half Life, a game that still seems to hold up today in terms of story detail (not necessarily being thrown directly at your face), but I've been spoiled by much prettier games for far too long.\n\nBlack Mesa is exactly what it is setting out to be: A complete re-make of Half Life in the Source engine with more detailed environments, much better lighting, shadows, textures, and visual effects as a result. The game will be entirely familiar to anyone who played the original game, and is a great way for people who have never played it before to give it a go.\nAt this point however, it's still missing Xen, an arguably weaker portion of the game, but still a portion of it regardless. Many were hoping, myself included, that the Steam release would finally see this part of the game included. Instead, it seems we got multiplayer for now.\n\nThis is easily one of the best looking Source games (unless you count the heavily modified version used in something like Titanfall) and it runs exactly like a source engine game. My system can run the game with full max settings at 4K resolution AND AA enabled at 60FPS no problem at all. Gameplay is smooth, very similar to Half Life 2, and keeps all the exact same mechanics.\n\nThe atmosphere was nailed perfectly. Obviously with the leap in engine and technology from the original, this game manages to have much better atmosphere than Half Life, with the previously mentioned better lighting and shadows, causing a more drastic and dramatic change to the Black Mesa facility after "the incident". Sound is fantastic as well. Something about that heavy, boot thud after falling down from something is very satisfying to me. All the gun models look fantastic and sound just as great, packing real punch.\n\nIt's really quite amazing how accurate this game is to the original, from item and environment placement to the same character voices, all while managing to add their own detail as well that feels entirely appropriate.\n\nIs it worth your $20 right now? Well, it's in Early Access right now for a reason: It's incomplete. My thought is that they developers are trying to gain a few bucks now so they can speed up the process on creating the remainder of the game, so if you want to support the developers, and to have much easier access to the game (rather than torrenting it and having to download the SDK) then go ahead. Otherwise, wait until it's out of E.A. We've waited this long already.

The weapons really need to be exactly like they were in Half-Life because strangely (And I'm not the most nitpicky I swear.) the small changes made to how they work just make them not very fun to use. The comabt is kinda dull. Before an update May 14th here is how I felt about two important enemy types you'll encounters remade incarnations: "What it really needs to do is fix the soldiers as they are not as intelligent or as fun to fight as their GoldSource counter parts..." While the HECU's mod AI had a jaw dropping aimbot and firing rate which did get fixed in the retail version but even still before the update the soldiers acted less like real humans or the HECU and more like reskinned combine in terms of behavior. As of the update currently the HECU run away, group up and spread out a lot more than before AND even make meangful hand signals which is a big improvement even though they aren't as smart as their Gold Source and Half-Life: Source counterparts YET. I've seen soldiers try and sometimes suceed in distracting me with supressing fire after gesturing a soldier to try to move up to my position which having check the console was done by  the AI and not thanks to a triggered scripted sequence. Effectivley they will sometimes try to sneak up on you in an unscripted manner. The Vortiguants now have similar timing for charging and aiming their lazers where as before in the 2012 mos they completley missed the point of their Half-Life counterparts having a charge up times. The only problem now is that you can dodge their attacks without getting behind cover like in Half-Life and can simply strafe right or left. On another dour note the Source engine is really starting to show it's age as these remade visuals are ( a wee bit) inconsistant in terms of quality. I feel some sort of Ultra option for textures and models should be added to uncompress the textures or use 2048x2048 resolution textures and higher poly versions of the models that having followed the games development I know they have. I would even suggest adding an "r_lod 0" option to the video settings so as to minimize whatever pop or lod shifts there are. Some of the faces look great while others look more dated than the faces from Half-Life 2 which might I add have aged quite well even more so for 2004. Even with all of that said this is probably the best game on early access right now and this iteration improves greatly apon the 2012 mod version. The development is slow but it's a fun, shiny version of Half-Life. Not everyone will be able to enjoy a game thats aged as well gameplay wise as Half-Life or get immeresed thanks to the visuals like I was and still am making this a must play for newcomers intersted in the series. Xen is missing too because it's in alpha but honestly thats a blessing in disguise. ;)","May 5, 2015","true","89.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

As long as you own any source game (Previous to the SDK Source 2007 release for free) this game will cost you nothing"\n\nThe Black Mesa Team\n\n\nSaying this words, it's a shame seeing that the proyect took so much money from them that they charge 20 dollars for the early access to the game (to finish Xen i suppose) that now that took their own words, make a tiny ball of paper and trowed at gamers because you have to pay to own a mod that was supposelly to be free on steam to anyone who enjoy and wants to play half life 1 witht the source engine at it's fullest.\n\nLeaving that aside this game it's the most wonderful and stunning game i've seen in years, the very same day this mod (i'm gonna call it game) was released i already took 4/5 hours to beat on hard just to feel the rush, everything about it was glorious, atention to every detail, an amazing soundtrack that really puts you on the move, faithful recreation of the game, being truth to it's origins and adding many things taken from the later installments of the half life saga, voices trully magnificent (especially doctor Kleiner), action everywhere. I enjoy this game really bad until i saw the price tag on Steam, still it's a great game and any half life fan will support the proyect, i just wished they had put it on greenlight along with "we need the money because the proyect without money cannot be completed".
