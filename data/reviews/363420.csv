Only if you survive.\nGame Overview\nLeap of Fate is a fast-paced, isometric, rogue-like game that is introduced on a science fiction/cyberpunk setting.\n\nIn this game, you will be able to play with four (4) different mages that gives you variation to match your play style and features different backstory for each of them.\n\nThese characters are "Aeon", the shadow mage (and the first one available for play), "Big Mo", the cyborg technomancer, "Mukai", the spirit channneler, and "Rasimov", the rogue occultist. Each of them will have different starting glyphs (equipped special items that has different effects when used), items, health as well as shadow walk charges and its effects.\n\nThere are a total of six (6) "Decks of Fate" (or levels) available per playthrough which increases difficulty in succession. Per level, you will have different missions given to you and clearing them will give you access to permanent upgrades for that specific character, as well as unlocking different appearances for them.\n\nEach Deck of Fate level has eight (8) different kinds of cards that you can venture through which are "Combat, Shop, Gift, Sacrifice, Upgrade, Mystery, Challenge, and Guardian". These cards can also be either buffed, restricted with a rule, or cursed which also adds more complexity and randomness to each level.\n\n\nThe Pros\nExcellent Audio - The voice actors feel very natural and on-point to the characters they portray while the soundtracks and sound effects for the game are well-made and brings in an atmospheric experience.\n\nHigh Replay Value - I credit the unique gameplay mechanics as well as the RNG (Random Number Generator) factor that makes this interesting and new with every run you make. Every rogue-like/lite must have this aspect or else it will result as a game that is very punishing without the rewarding feeling of accomplishment.\n\nNeat Aesthetics - The game has a really neat visual style that is weirdly enticing. It also fits the dark cyberpunk theme of the game and feels natural with the way they executed it.\n\nFluid Controls - Since this game requires you to be focused as you evade and move through corner by corner on every map, it is a given that the game has this factor, and it does deliver the standard.\nThe Cons\nPresent Game Bugs - The game has some minor bugs that could possibly hinder a good playthrough, and we do not want that when playing a very punishing game. So far, I had two random crashes from the game (which could be due to prolonged gameplay). I also had a weird button overlapping bug (which is showcased on my screenshots) that almost prevented me from using a great perk. I am not sure if this is another bug, but when you quit a certain level and start another one, the missions are stuck on what level you are previously in, making you impossible to clear it until you reach that certain level again.\n\nSession-Based Gameplay - Right now, the game doesn't offer a save option for you to resume your playthrough on a later date. Though you might not find the use of this on a rogue-like especially when it is a fast-paced one (and might ruin the flavor of it since some might exploit the save once you've reached a certain stage), it might be a good addition to atleast counter the effects of a sudden-crash.\n\nThe Verdict\nA must buy for rogue-like lovers. And for those of you who just stumbled upon the game and took even a little bit of interest in playing it, it really is worth the try.\n\nIf you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","April 23","true","21.8"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","36","41","0","0"

It's also possibly my favorite rogue-lite game also. Where to start...\n\nFirst, it's a top-down twin stick shooter with rogue-lite elements (similar to the game play of something like Binding of Isaac or Nuclear Throne). It handles great with tight controls that work great for controllers or keyboard and mouse, whichever you prefer. What's also great is that the controller support and controls were basically made from the ground up to be super intuitive and they did an amazing job on those.\n\nThe game also has an awesome setup and atmosphere all around. The stories and intros usually revolve around secret societies or other things related to the occult. It has a beautiful cyberpunk magic oriented aura around it and it really shines in the story cutscenes and definitely during gameplay.\n\nAll of the characters play great and offer VERY different styles of play. I won't spoil what their different abilities and such are here, but trust me they are quite fun, especially Mukai who can reflect basically any type of projectile with practice.\n\nAlso the glyphs and skills are really unique and meaningful, along with being different pretty much everytime so that each run will be a different build in skills and powers than the last.\n\nThe story scenes are very well done with good voicing that immerse you in the lore and world of these people. Even the avatar of fates (the eyeball guy in the suit) has an interesting and quirky nature that kind of makes you happy to see him any time he shows up.\n\nOne other key feature of interest and praise is the karma system which isn't what it sounds like. It basically means that you can accumulate a type of resource (karma) which looks like a golden triangle with a design on it, and once you have 100, if you die during a run, you have the choice once per run to continue. You will find this resource fairly often in smaller chunks of five or ten and once you have a bunch, you can save it and use it when you really need it for a good run.\n\nOverall, I can't say enough good things about this game. I have been playing it sparatically ever since it came into Early Access. It has come a LONG ways from where it started and now with the updated UI and intuitive design and menu, it is a true joy to play! I recommend everyone that loves games of the genre go get this now! 10/10","March 30","true","13.3"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","30","40","7","0"

While I have not played with a controller yet, the keyboard and mouse are perfectly fine.\n-Cell Shaded graphics look very good and don't interfere too much with the bullet madness of the game\n-Very In depth upgrade system with alternate abilities and passive upgrades to your attacks, movement, and health\n-Lots of good voice acting\n-Soundtrack is great, fits the theme of the game well. Ambient effects fit perfectly.\n-Characters all have their own unique backstories with stillframe cinematics that can be unlocked.\n-Level design, while simplistic, gives each area it's own feel while not cluttering up the screen.\n\n-Cons\n-The cell shading can sometimes become a hinderance when things get REALLY busy on the screen, creating a sort of blur effect. It's nothing major but something to consider.\n-Tutorial is there but bare. Certain minor aspects of the game arn't explained at the start ( such as how the Karma system works, only being able to upgrade once per card visit, certain icons lacking hover over tooltips ). Game has a very trial by fire start to it, so keep that in mind when going into it.\n-Some attacks lack an "Oomph!" feeling to them which can make firing into a crowd of dudes lack excitement. It's hard to describe but it's missing that "chunky" feeling if that makes sense.\n\n--Gameplay\nIf you have ever played Hand of Fate ( which is also a great game ), then you'll be slightly familiar with how the level design works and which may be the deciding factor in your purchase. For those of you who have not played Hand of Fate, Leap of Fate uses a somewhat similiar method to that game when going into a new level. You start each run by shuffling a deck of cards together and then having them layed out in a descending pattern on a table in front of you. Each card is dealt face down except for the top card and as you clear each card the ones around it are flipped face up. These cards range from combat encounters, where you'll teleport to a small zone to duke it out with a batch of baddies, shops where you can purchase items, upgrade cards which allow you to boost one of your character's abilities permanently ( these persist throughout runs ), mystery cards which can be unlocked with keys aquired from either playing or the shop, challenge cards which present you with a mission for that level ( clear 15 dudes with your special ) and finally a Guardian card which will lead you into an ecounter with that levels boss. After clearing a run, you get teleported back to the "home" area to begin the next difficulty.\n\nI will be playing this game a lot more in the future but from the time I've already had with it I have enjoyed it immensly and do not regret my purchase. A full price buy for sure, a sale buy without a doubt.","March 30","true","4.2"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","21","28","5","3"

Although it took me just about an hour and a half to finish easy mode. I did have some luck on the maps and bought a continue. Besides that, easy mode only has 3 levels (I explain more about this later). Now im on normal mode and I can barely get to level 3 (out of 6 levels). This isn't necessarily a bad thing, each time you die and have to start over you still make some progress by either unlocking achievments, which give rewards or getting points you can spend in your next game.\n\nThe action feels pretty smooth, however it can be a little chaotic at times. Which isn't a big issue, it just makes it very difficult to avoid being hit at those moments. Customization seems to be neat, I just haven't gotten the chance to see a lot of it yet. Due to the fact it takes a lot of time to try out all the different skills, and the skill trees are hard to level up when your just new to this game. You simply.. just die to fast. To clarify, you don't die every few minutes (unless your really bad). You just die often before you can get to the point of upgrading your skills.\n\nA random deck of cards is dealt, each card is one map. Whether it being enemies, an upgrade or just treasure. You can choose which one you take next, untill you reach the point of one of the last cards giving an entrance to the next level.\nYou can also re-enter cards, to pick up some health (if you didn't need it before), or to get the upgrade you couldn't afford before. So choose wisely before ending a level.\n\nI like the soundtracks used in this game, it fits in pretty well. Even more, I like the story. About a secret organization called cabal. Something you could compare to the illuminati. You get some textures in between the levels, which are written by different kind of persons, like spirit channelers or reporters. Giving more of an indept on whats going on. Besides those textures you unlock destiny videos of your class. Showing a lot of information on your roll into this story.\nSo far there is just one out of four classes playable, but since its still early access this is understandable.\n\nSo if ur into conspiracies, like a fast paced action shooter, with tons of custimozation. I'd say give it a try!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgL4r16ovk0","July 31, 2015","true","10.3"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","17","22","2","1"

Still the game is strongly skill based. Even in the worst situations: Geat pecision, wise movement and good timing can turn the tides in your favor, just for holding out this one card-battle. On the other side there are lots of archivements, some permanent upgrades and a currency for inbetween games, that let you make progress aside from your personal skillevel.\n\nMost importantly a option to get ONE (and only one) extray life when paying the rare KAMA, (that has be gathered over the curse serveral rounds). Because of this mechanic you can extent great runs and not let them being destroyed by one single mistake.\n\nThe graphics and athmosphere and even the voiceacting are great! There in an emphasis on Story, ever changing (still consistent) visuals and a overall dark cyberpunk mood!\n\nThe game is not ready jet but its polished already, and the balancing is very good for an early access rouglike!\nRecomended!","August 6, 2015","true","32.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fhoenix/recommended/363420/","Fhoenix","Fhoenix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fhoenix/","186 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've been playing the game since Early access and I like it very much.\n\nIt's a bit like Gauntlet mixed with Hand of Fate. Only instead of Warrior/Wizard/Elf you have four different Mages. Which is awesome because personally I think we need more games focusing on magic specifically.\nWhile the game is basically about killing monsters with magic, it has great intros and outros for every character that add flavor and make every playthrough a mystic journey instead of your basic hack and slash adventure. The atmosphere in the game is great.\n\nThere are three ability trees and positions of abilities in a tree are randomised every session. Abilities are bought with mana (except for one character who pays with his own health) and mana is mostly gained through special kills. To survive later stages you want a good build, and for that you would need a lot mana, but being greedy and trying to arrange special kills can also lead to your death. So playing is balancing act between trying to survive and trying to become stronger.\nThe game is a rogue lite. You unlock some things by doing in-game missions, but each session is a fresh start, you lose all your abilities/glyphs/mana, so you can't just overpower the game by grinding. And I would say the game is pretty hard.\n\nYou can finish a playthrough in half an hour (good luck not dying though!), but to unlock everything and see every ending for every character you would have to play for hours. And if you like this type of game you probably will play it for hours :)\n\nI can't really think of anything bad to say about the game, except that I would have liked it to have more levels/content. But for this price I can easily recommend you buy it.\n\n","March 25","true","36.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","14","17","2","0"

Doubly so if you like occult and cybernetic themes. It's a twin stick shooter with six levels, randomized rewards, challenges, hazards and skill trees. The focus is on the gameplay, but it does boast a fairly well crafted atmosphere with occult elements peppered throughout (the three skill trees, for instance, are based on the tantric chakras, though very loosely). There are several clever design ideas, such as the random constraints on combat that can pay handsomely if you take them on, the stories of the character unlocking via gameplay challenges, and the ability to manipulate the levels under certain circumstances.\n\nThe randomized skill trees are the second key component of the replayability, as it can drastically alter your strategy from run to run. The first key component is the roster of four very different characters. A nimble, all purpose mage, a cyborg tank with very high survivibility, a melee fighter who can reflect projectiles, and a blood mage that is all about the high risk, high reward.\n\nThe performance is good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/363420/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2003 products in account","Leap of Fate is a top down rogue-like with fast paced combat. The game takes place in a cyberpunk New York City in which there is a strong presence of the arcane arts.\n\nYou start by playing with one of four characters, and as you play and complete missions you’ll unlock the other three. Each character corresponds to a certain card and you’ll be presented with a cutscene that explains how these people came into contact with magic when you choose them for the first time. Each playthrough is divided into several different levels, each of them being more difficult than the last. They are also uniquely designed, each with their own theme and unique enemy types. In each of these levels you’ll be able to complete various missions which can be something like killing X enemies using a special ability. Completing missions will not only allow you to unlock the other characters but it will also unlock permanent upgrades to those characters.\n\nThe  game presents you this entire process in the form of you looking to find your fate and thus, you take part in the Trial of Fates. Each level presents you with a deck of cards, and each of these cards represents a different encounter. These can be combat encounters, challenges, shops and so on. Before selecting which card you want to undertake you can see their difficulty and how big is their reward. These rewards come in the form of mana, which can be used to upgrade passive, attack and mobility skills. In the shop you can buy things like health, energy cells (which allow you to use different skills more times) and keys, which you can use to unlock chests or open a different path to go through on your deck.\n\nThe randomness of the game, not only in terms of the layout of each level but also in terms of the variety of the various skills and abilities which you can come across, as well as the fact that your fate will not always be the same, make this game highly replayable. And if you add to that a really fast paced combat that plays like a top-down shooter with some special abilities thrown into there, you get a really solid and enjoyable experience.\n\nPros:Fast-paced combat with tons of varied abilities\nGreat soundtrack\nHighly replayable\nGreat aesthetic\nCons:No way to save game. If you have to quit in the middle of a run you’ll have to start over the next time you play the game\nDespite supporting fullscreen and 1080p, while in combat the runs in some sort of 4:3 aspect ratio, with black bars on both sides\nOverall thoughts:\nLeap of Fate is a blast to play and two different playthroughs will probably never be the same. Combat is simple but offers a challenge to most players and the huge variety of abilities that you can get only help the game feel fresh everytime you go for another run. I highly recommend you check this one out if you’re fan of fast paced shooters or rogue-likes in general.","April 18","true","6.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

A lot of the achievements seem silly and much more luck than skill based, the last ending requires beating the game on hard mode and I have only managed to get to the second to last level on hard mode.

It's like Nuclear Throne however the stages are much smaller and it is a lot more movement based.

Its a top down/isometric shooter with both rpg and rogue-lite elements.  The rpg elements in a single run consist of different special attacks and a several semi-randomly generated skill trees.  There are also different characters you can unlock as you play each with slightly different play styles.\n\nThe gameplay is solid mainly focused on your ability to dodge enemies and projectiles while managing the number of bombs/dashes you have left.  While the game gets progressively harder as you advance you also can accumulate power ups at a pretty fast rate.  My biggest complaint about the in-game progression is the inability to get new challenges after you complete them in a single run(this may have changed since)\n\nThe ingame character models, level design, environmental objects are all nicely drawn but nothing specials.

Where the game is heavy on cyberpunk/urban fantasy style (think Shadowrun), it is light on any actual substance. This is just as well since the very minimal sketchy cutscenes are accompanied by dialog that must have been translated (poorly), only to be delivered by a bored sounding actor.\n\nLeap of Fate isn't about the story, though. We're here for the frantic, colorful combat, the randomized skill trees, the cool, but wildly unbalanced glyphs that grant game breaking super powers and mana, represented by so very many little dots that Pacman would yak at the prospect of consuming so many.\n\nThe game is laid out in a series of cards that represent different situations: fights, mysteries, shops, challenges and an assortment of ways to upgrade any of the four very different unlockable characters. This structure of cards is the first of many randomized system that make Leap of Fate great for a quick replay. While these cards create a flowchart through the level, there are other powers available that allow you to change fate, meaning that certain cards can be skipped or altered.\n\nThis breaking of the rules, changing how and what you can do spills over into the combat, which plays out very differently depending on which character you're playing, what you've managed to stumble across and excatly which set of creepy, funny, strange baddies you're fighting.\n\nCombat controversially shifts from a 16:9 aspect ratio to 4:3, making me feel like I played a stand up arcade game, maybe some off brand, spruced up Robotron. Some have complained that the black bars at side of the screen make for wasted space. I agree with that observation only so far as the UI elements could have been put into these dark columns, thus clearing the view for the dozens of baddies and their pew-pew-pew. The developers have been responsive on the aspect issue, explaining that the wider view made the game too easy, less fun. I'm fine with that explanation, but any buyer should know that the action portion of the game feels like playing a Sega Genesis on a CRT.\n\nThe skill trees for each character are randomized at the start of every game, making for a different progression on each play through. On one play I found myself stacking up effects on my basic attack power, in another I wound up collecting abilities that let me 'cheat' by having unlimited keys to open locked chests, or by looking at the upside down cards in hopes of finding good toys or even just the level boss.\n\nCombat consists of moving by WASD, clicking the left mouse button for a basic attack, the right mouse button for a glyph (nuke) and the space bar for shadow walking (i.e. teleporting/dodging): that's it.\n\nThe glyphs are a mixed bag. Some are over-powered nukes, others are whimpering duds. Invariably, drawing a good random replacement glyph on the first level meant the difference between an easy play or an unfortunate, slogging end. While I enjoyed the sheer variety of ways the glyphs could affect the combat environment, I felt they had too great an impact.\n\nThe music is glitzy, wanking hair metal guitar, making bombastic flourishes at every turn. Each level also features a different ambient combat track, to keep things from getting stale. The sound effects are also excellent, though the voices (as mentioned earlier) are downright bad.\n\nThe graphics are crisp and colorful, effectively rendering imaginative and varied enemies, as well as a mix of environments and lighting effects to keep it all interesting. The techno-magic powers your character wields, along with the weird blasts, rays and barbed-wire wrapped mummies swinging upside down from chains. (yes, that's in the game) are all flashy and fun.\n\nLeap of Fate boasts a host of unlocks, spread across all four characters. Since these special perks are permanent a failed game may still yield a new power for all future play throughs. More cinematics are unlockable, should the introductory movies for each character not be enough to convince you that they're all terrible. Fortunately they're brief, skippable and irrelevant to actually enjoying the gameplay.\n\nIn addition to all the glyphs, the skill trees, the unlocks and all that, the game also offers extra missions that can be linked to a particular level or card or tracked over the course of the entire game. If that's not enough, every once in a while you are offered a wager, a special set of rules to complete a particular combat (such as one shot/one kill) that can be declined only at a price.\n\nWith the surging music, wild fights, mish-mash of powers and constant spewing of little purple mana dots, Leap of Fate feels like an over-caffienated slot machine imported from a country that no one can find on any map, linked to an obscure comic book franchise that no one has ever read: Leap of Fate is weird, engaging and, most importantly, a ton of fun.","April 5","true","40.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

You will enter a trial, one of which will reveal your true fate. Equipped with magical abilities and weapons, the fight against your fears will be fast and frantic. After all, it is just a leap of fate!\n\nLeap of Fate is roguelike/ top down shooter type of game. You will take control of one of four characters (you start with one and have to unlock the other three) available to you. Then you will see a cut scene which will tell you the story of the character you have chosen. Right after that you will cross a busy street in downtown New York City and enter your trial. You will have to go through 6 levels to find your fate. Each level is randomised and is set up via a deck of tarot cards. The aim of each level is to discover under which tarot card the Guardian is (Boss of the level) and to defeat him/her. The deck of tarot will have several types of card: Combat cards, from one to three waves to beat the stage and at the end of it you may or may not receive a treasure chest as a reward (the card will tell you if you will receive a reward or not); Mystery card – You may get health regeneration, mana, keys, energy or even some cards to update your deck (or, if you’re lucky, you may even get a card that reveals the whereabouts of the Guardian); Shop cards – where you can purchase goodies with the mana you collected from the stages; Challenge card – you will be given a challenge and if you succeed you might receive an additional health bar (see description of the challenge). On top of that, each character will have missions to achieve within each level which will help you to either unlock well-needed abilities but also unlock your new character.\n\nThe combat phase is really fun and addictive but can be really difficult (this is playing on the normal difficulty) especially with the last two characters. You will land on the stage and enemies will come at you from, left, right and centre. Some are easy to destroy and others are very challenging. Your character has a Normal Attack, the Shadow Walk ability and a Glyph (Special abilities, which you can change, by the way, by purchasing another one at the shop with your mana). Depending on how you kill your enemies, (eg. with your Glyph or Shadow Walk) you will receive mana. Here and there, enemies will drop a health regeneration icon upon dying. Make sure to grab them if you need it or save it for later!\n\nThere are three Skill Trees available for your characters: passive, attack and mobility. They are basically upgrades during the gameplay and they are also randomised. Well, what I mean is that you can’t choose which one of the three skills to upgrade; it will be done for you (it will be mentioned on the card) but you can choose one of the two options available at the time. Oh, and make sure you collect enough mana to purchase the upgrade!\n\nGraphically this game looks great and the animations are fluid. Control-wise, you can play with your gamepad or your mouse and keyboard. Personally I prefer the mouse and keyboard.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n-	Great graphics\n-	Great game concept\n-	Randomised levels\n-	Four characters to play, each with their own abilities\n-	Good re-playability\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~~\n-	Can be frustrating at times\n\nLeap of Fate is a fantastic game! Sometimes you are not sure about whether or not to purchase a game, and you actually have to take a leap of fate. Well, this game is the real thing. Just get “Leap of Fate!”\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

If you like rogue-like top-down shooters, or even just top-down shooters in general, this is a must have.\n\nThe controls are your standard WASD to move, left click to do regular attacks, right click to cast your special, and space bar to shadow walk.  There are also 4 different characters you can play (they have to be unlocked though), each one has their own distinct set of attacks and spells.\n\n\nWhat separates this from other top-down shooters is that each stage has a set of cards where you can fight, earn rewards, upgrade skills, and fight bosses.  Best part is you get to choose which cards you want to enter, but eventually you have to find the boss/guardian card and beat it to advance to the next stage.\n\nAnother unique feature is the randomized skill tree.  As you play the levels within the stages you may enounter upgrade cards or tokens that let you upgrade skills.  There are 3 different branches, passives, combat, and mobility.  You don't get to choose which branch, but you do get to pick a skill within that branch, granted you have enough mana (the currency) to purchase it.\n\nLastly regarding the unique features, you can find various spells/glyphs within each stage or get a token to get a free random spell.  They are all unique and have awesome effects against enemies.\n\n\nFor the hours:price ratio, you will definitely get your money's worth and more.  There is a lot of replayability in the game with the various unlocks such as character skins, permanent skill upgrades, and extra story regarding the character.  What makes this even better is there's a hard mode which gives you a few additional unlocks.\n\nMy only gripe with this game is the levels  are fairly tight, meaning there isn't much maneuvariblity and you can get cornered very easily.  Some levels are just wierdly layed out along with some awkward structure placements, make it sometimes not fun to play.\n\n\nIn conclusion Leap of Fate is a great game to have in your library collection and a game you can always come back to any time and have fun.  I know I did not cover every aspect of this game as this review would turn into a novel.  The points I brought up in this review I feel are the highlights of the game.  If you have any further questions feel free to leave it as a comment and I'll be more than happy to answer them.\n\nI hope this review helps you decide whether to purchase the game or not.","April 8","true","10.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

This twitch-shooter rogue-like has a surprising amount of depth to it when you pull back the layers of chaotic combat it's wrapped in. Some mechanics, such as only getting mana (the game's currency) when killing enemies a specific way forces you to play with finesse rather than just to survive. It's incredibly satisfying to take down a hoard of enemies while dodging, teleporting, and blasting your way through. I keep finding myself saying "just one more", which is exactly what a rogue-like should be.\n\nAll that being said, the game IS in early access and I have many hopes for it before its full release. At the time of writing this there are two playable characters, each with their own variations of playstyle and replayability, but I am already itching to try out different ones. The 6 different zones of the game start to get quite repetative, especially the early ones you are going to go through again and again. The game plays fair for the most part, but every now and then you get screwed by encountering a level which randomly now makes it so you die in one hit - this puts a huge damper on an otherwise great run and can be frustrating.\n\nStill, it's a ton of fun shooting baddies and grabbing upgrades, and each run plays different with the vast amount of power-ups. The price makes it hard to justify a purchase right away, but I've been incredibly pleased with what Clever-Plays has put out so far and look forward to the future additions.\n\nUPDATE: There have been a number of additions to the game since I first tried my hand at it, and I must say I am impressed with how Leap of Fate has evolved. The game has taken the potentially frustrating aspects of being screwed over by random chance and still maintains it's tough level of difficulty. The new level progression system very much rewards you for continued play, even if you are not great. There is a ton of content to unlock that will keep completionists working for a while. I know I'll jump back in to pick this one up every now and then.","September 16, 2015","true","15.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/363420/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","I’m unabashedly going to tell you before I get any further into this feature that I love this game. Love. Love. Love. Then again that’s nothing entirely new. So did The Escapist, Kotaku and Gaming Trend. It’s a brilliant action rogue-like game that is played entirely from an isometric perspective. The game is simply a winner.\n\nWith the beginning of the game telling such an interesting story about the first player controlled character, Aeon, I would have figured that the game would have had a heavy focus on its story. Instead, the developers decided to push the game’s action gameplay. This was an interesting decision but one that I believe works out extremely well. There is still a vivid story to be discovered but it is up to the player to discover it.\n\nCombat is exciting even if it’s not entirely unique. Reminds me of a slimmed down action RPG such as Diablo or Torchlight. There’s a bit of room for strategy and intelligent decision making as you are constanly forced to think on your feet. The game and therefore the action is far from easy but feels very fair. I have yet to get hit let alone die in a situation where I didn’t immediately realize what I had done incorrectly. Sometimes a bad mistake can snowball dependent upon how much usage of your skills such as shadow walking you have already used in a fight.\n\nI felt that the quality of the graphics are superb. I’ve read elsewhere that others aren’t as enamored with them as what I am but in my opinion the visual effects are on a different level than most indie games. They marry very well with the action at hand and never feel as though they’re in the way or any less than what you would hope to have. The art design is very much in keeping with the tone and the narrative of the game. This is particularly highlighted with the character stories that are told when you first start a game with a new character.\n\nThe pyramid of cards reminded me of Hand of Fate albeit the two games are very different. Giving the player the feeling of choice – limited though it may be – was a very nice touch. In fact, it opens up some scope for strategy between levels. When do you allow yourself to go to the shop? Do you wait until you’re low on health and hope that health is able to be purchased when you are desperate for it? DO you go early and see that you should have gone later? The same can apply to the ‘gifts’ and ‘mystery’ cards. Pick the wrong time to click a card and it can spell your future doom.\n\nI was also a fan of the mission system which is directly tied to the character progression system. It’s pretty simple. You need to complete specific set challenges that are given to you at the beginning of each game. Complete enough missions and your character progresses to the next level unlocking more and more powers and abilities. It works really well given how difficult the game actually is. It gave me a feeling of progression even if I didn’t make it as far into the level system as I had hoped I would.\n\nThose who adore a challenge will find plenty within Leap of Fate. It’s a wonderfully presented game that is just begging you to sink your teeth into it.","May 2","true","5.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I recommend this game. If you really want to play the game and you can't wait (like me), or you really want to help devs, buy it. But if you're not that impatient, I recommend you to wait because there's not that much content, and there is still some polish to do.\n\nPros :\n+ Graphics, effects and arts are pretty nice.\n\n+ The gameplay is dynamic, and is very enjoyable. Simple to use, hard to master.\n\n+ Challenge, the game is not easy at all, and you will DIE, but you will want to replay more and more until you finally finish a run. And you have only one continue per runs !\n\n+ There's a skill tree that is randomized each run and you can get some perma buffs by doing achievement. Upgrades are really coooool !\n\n+ You can unlock some spells that will change your play style.\n\n+ Ennemies patterns are nice designed and the A.I. is good.\n\n+ It's very fun.\n\nNeutral :\n\n~ Musics are ok. Some are good, some not really, but in general it sticks well to the ambiance of the world.\n\nCons :\n- The price. I think that's what it will block you about trying or not this game. Maybe wait a bit before buying this if you don't know if it's worth or not.\n\n- Feels like ennemies animations are laggy while the hero animations are smooths.

(780 GTX Ti for the graphics card)\n\n- I do like the graphics and the aesthetic of the game, although sometimes some of the maps do feel samey in a way, but I'm sure that'll be changed in the future. (Samey in the way they look not the way they play)\n\nAll-in-all it's a good rogue-lite for those looking for this type of games :)\n\n\nMy preview of the game:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb4X--JXeMU","September 29, 2015","true","3.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

What differentiates this game from others is the way that you gain a set of cards with what you can fight with.\n\nGameplayAs mentioned above, this is a rather unique way of making your game in this genre of gaming. With the way that you gain a set of cards to fight with throughout each stage makes the game that bit more interesting. The best thing about this card system ts that you can choose what cards you want to enter with and therefor pick out the  best cards and create nice decks. Even though this does sound like more of a card game, this game is definatly still sticking to the roguelike genre, with it's sometimes cruel and diffcult stages that you will encounter throughout the game. With the game having some upgrade skills that you can aquire and bosses for you to defeat it really does make the game challenging to play.\n\nAnother unique mechanic that is implimented into this game is the randomized skill tree that you have. Playing through the stages that you come across you have a chance to pick up a upgrade token or cards that will allow you to spend on upgradign your skills. The fun thing about this random skill tree is that you don't get to choose which branch you go down (Passive, combat or mobility) but you get to choose a skill you wish to learn from this branch. This feature can soemtimes screw your run up a bit as you may not want to choose from the branch that it randomly picks for you.\n\nThere is a nice variety of characters that you can choose to play as, they all have their own types of attacks which really differ from one another making each of them unique to their own play styles. With their different abilities and such they are all very fun to play as, and testing them all out to see what each character has to offer is fun as well. Although it does sound all nice and such, sometiems the game does lack that bit of depth that is needed in this type of game, I would of liked to see more depth in the story to really pull the player into the game more.\n\nWhen you first enter the game is sets up a great atmosphere that really sets up the game for what it is. The graphics of the game are nice, and I like the different types of areas that you can get into upon entering each stage throughout the game. All of the enemies that you encounter feel like they have had a lot of time put into them, with some of them having some pretty unique attacks. The cutscenes that occur in the game really tell the story well, with the lighting and shadowing of the game really making it the sort of atmosphere you would expect it to be in.\n\nAt first the music in this game is rather nice to listen to, but after a couple of hours of listening to the same soundtrack over and over it does get a bit reptivite and boring to listen to. Even though each setting has it's own soundtrack I still found it reptivite to listen to. The sounds of everything are nice, although I feel like there could be a bit more crisp and clearer at times.\n\nPros+ A unique twist on the type of genre\n+ Beautiful graphics\n+ Nice variety of character to choose from, with different play styles\n+ Decent amount of replay ability\n+ Trading cards & Achievements\n\nCons- Sometimes lack of depth to the game\n- Music got a bit reptivite after a few hours of gameplay\n\nResult / Final thoughtsIn conclusion, I really liked Leap of Fate. It takes a few new types of mechanics and mixes it in with the roguelike top down shooter genre of gaming that really suits it well. There is a nice amount of characters to be with them all having their own unique types of play styles. Although the music can get a bit reptivite at times and the game is missing somewhat lack of depth, I still recommened this to anyone who enjoys roguelikes.\n\nRating: 7.8/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Sometimes You Playing curator group here.","April 15","true","3.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

This trend is becoming a little annoying. It seems this genre is exploited to the maximum and personally I'm tired of it. I was hoping to take a loooong break from such games - making Enter The Gungeon my last expierence with roguelikes. Then I saw Leap of Fate. I'm a sci fi/cyberpunk junkie, so i just could not resist. To hell with it, I'm buying the game! Damn it, i said to myself - why am I so hot-headed? I WILL regret that.\n\nThe thing is - i don't regret it. Leap of Fate is one of my favorite roguelite's of 2016. Starting from the story and aesthetics - sweet mixture of sci-fi, magic, mysticsm and cyberpunk. Nothing can go wrong here! Suprisingly, the storyline is pretty decent too. You unveil fates of your 4 main protagonists by playing them and achieving character goals. It's all well voice-acted, even if cutscenes are just stills - it's impressive.\nThe core gameplay is very fast and satyfsying. You play levels - inside randomized tarot decks. Each cards is a encouter or a bonus. Its all very fluid - transitionst between choosing cards and fight scenes are instant. Battles are similar to common hack&slash games, like Diablo. It's all quick and full of explosions. Also - the music keeps you immersed.\n\nCompleting all 6 levels in one go... is a huge task. But this games gives You small bonuses for trying. You can earn permament upgrades for your guys, you don't lose everything upon death. This is comforting, but if you cringe at idea of losing most of your stuff with death - this won't help You much. It's still a roguelike game! Only a little more forgiving.\nLeap of Fate is fair, immersive and really well designed. It gets though eventually, but that's what we like about roguelikes!","June 2","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are actually pretty great and the soundtrack definitely fits the dystopian future in which it seems to take place. The four characters available each require a different playstyle -some of which you will love and some of which will make you find yourself pondering whether or not you would trade a finger to not have to play ever again... I'm looking at you, Mukai! (>_<#)\n\nThe game can be very unforgiving but, ultimately, leaves you feeling as if you really worked for and earned the reward you've just spent hours trying to achieve.\n\nI definitely suggest this game. I have zero regrets about buying it, no matter how many times I realized I'd been raging so hard I could see stars in my field of vision. The risk and reward I've faced have sent me through the entire spectrum of emotions and left me absolutely satisfied.\n\nIf I had any advice for anyone trying to decide if they should buy it's this: The two main things you will need to play this game are Patience and Masochism. Sometimes you're faced with a goal that requires waiting until you come across a mission you know you can beat (even if it takes quitting and restarting until you get that mission lol) and you will take a lot of punishment on your way through the game.\n\nBut it is absolutely worth it.","April 3","true","14.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you can handle the aspect ratio then this game has great potential. Unfortunately for me I cant overcome that!\n\n\nHad it been at all apparent on the store page that 72 Sqare inches of my screen were going to be taken up by black bars I would have simply never had purchased this game. Keeping in mind that my monitor has 252 sq inches of usable space. 72sqin is 28.5% of my screenspace. This only becomes worse for those who have even larger or wider monitors.\n\nIt came as a complete surprise to me that the game would be using a 4:3 aspect ratio because the screenshots and videos are all doctored to appear fullscreen. I don't know if it was or was not intentional that the 4:3 aspect ratio is hidden from the store page but it should be shown, or at least mentioned in the description.\n\nThe developers have mentioned that the 4:3 aspect ratio is intentional, and its staying around and essentially if you don't like that though luck for you. So don't expect an option to turn it off.\n\nThere are some good parts of the game though, IF you can get past the massive amount of black space taking over your screen then the gameplay is pretty fun. Hard mode is locked for new players so I didnt get to experience true chaos, but the 7 or so maps I played gave a taste of what the game is generally about. Albeit the maps (atleast the early ones) last roughly 10-15 seconds before you clear them and have to hold 'E' to go back to base (which by the way is the only gameplay aspect that uses your whole monitor, which makes goign in and out of missions even more irritating)\n\n\nKeep in mind i've only played 7 or 8 missions but... The 15 second slaughter > Base > 15 second slaughter chain reminds me of the short browser based minigames where you complete simple tasks in a short amount of time untill you screw up and fail to complete the task.\n\nThe randomised skill tree (although I personally didnt make it past the first skill point) sets this game up for amazing things. But as long as those black bars are around to make waste of barely under a third of modern gamers massive monitors then for those like me, mediocre is where it will find itself.","March 31","false","0.5"," 25 of 52 people (48%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","48","25","52","7","2"

I take MAJOR issue with their upgrade system.\nTake this with a grain of salt, becaue I seem to be in the minority of people who doesnt like grinding achievements, and grinding in general. So saying, yeah its a rougelike because you can unlock achiements that give you bonuses is kinda annoying. Seriously, I like using the dash as an escape which is as I see it the purpose of the dash to "dash away" however, the achievement to upgrade the main character, is to kill like 250 characters while dashing. This may not sound like that much but its not a powerful attack, you have to dash 2-3 times to kill the weakest enemies in the game, while you only get like 3 charges per round. However, even if you want to spend time weakening enemies, and kill 3 or so per dash, means even at grinding you kill 9 per round. Its frankly redicoulous in my opinion. And they are the only real tangible upgrades your able to get so I cant really avoid getting them.\n\nThus the moral of my story is, its a great game with a lot of potential that is ruined by one flaw in the design. However note, if you dont mind spending a couple hours grinding the achievements this wont effect you, but I imagine the characters released later will also have abilities that require grinding.\n\nTLDR version - Achievements=upgrades, Achiements are grindy and take forever, Repetative without upgrades (Grindy Achievements), Too bad has a lot of promise.","September 27, 2015","false","4.8"," 18 of 43 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","18","43","0","6"
