I find also the place very great: it's a boat and you're staying in it. Though the map isn't interactive at all, it's easy to find your way.\n\nThe minigames themselves are varied and I've appreciated the timed ones - though 3 minutes is too long for my taste. And the HOG are also challenging: some items are really obvious while others, being partially hidden or really well hidden to the point where you think they're part of the scenery or another object, are quite challenging.\n\nYou can also replay the HO or the minigames in the menu, which is a nice bonus.\n\nNot the casual game of the year but very very refreshing game.","May 25, 2015","true","3.5"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

There is also an issue with needing pixel accuracy for certain item interactions.\n\nThe only difference between normal and advanced difficulties is that the normal mode will sometimes, if it feels like it, make certain interactables (usually pearls) sparkle. It is a bit buggy, though, because it will also make areas where you have already picked things up sparkle, or areas where there is absolutely nothing of interest sparkle. Hidden object screens in both difficulties are clearly noted.\n\nHidden Object Puzzles:\n\nYou would think that the items would be pretty clearly distinguishable from each other, since each object is a separate cg-rendered model, but everything looks like it's made out of the same cheap plastic; if two items have a similar colour, they just blend together.\n\nThe puzzles at least make a bit more sense than most in the genre - the kitchen contains cooking-related items, the first-aid kit contains medical supplies, and the crew quarters and storerooms contain a wider assortment of gear and personal effects. There aren't too many piles of junk, or random Victorian dolls, or vegetables mixed in with antiques like you see in other HOGs.\n\nOne slightly irksome thing is that interactables within the hidden object screens are not indicated in any way, so any of the items stashed within containers or compartments are especially difficult to locate. It kind of defeats the purpose of strategic hunting if you have to randomly click on everything that might be a secret cache.\n\nAdditionally, at least two of the puzzles have random insects crawling all over them for "atmosphere," so I hope you like bugs.\n\nMini-games:\n\nSpeaking of creepy crawlies, I hope you also like rats and spiders because they each have their own mini-game.\n\nI will at least give this game props for creativity.\n\nSome of mini-games were tedious, and involved either "do this repetitive thing for a full three minutes" or "see how fast you can click and drag." Other mini-games were actually fun, though, and were different from any of the formulaic genre standards. I especially liked the match-3 tile-flipping game.\n\nAt the completion of each puzzle, a little victory jingle plays, and fireworks explode from each side of the screen. So much for the immersive horror experience. "Something horrible is happening on the ship, but I just opened a door. Party time!"\n\nThere is also a game-wide hidden object puzzle of finding little pearls hidden all over the ship. I like that the game adds another layer of complexity with this challenge.\n\nStory:\n\nYou, a girl with a magic ring that wards off evil spirits, book passage on a cargo ship that just happens to have an evil spirit problem. Go figure. You must then spend an entire evening pretending to be an exterminator, a mechanic, a janitor, a navigator, and a really, really bad thief. (Seriously, you successfully crack a lock in a mini-game, and then the cutscene shows your character doing a completely different and stupid action that results in negative consequences.)\n\nThe gameplay is entirely linear, but you will need to refer to your journal to figure out where you should be trying to go next and why it matters. Without the journal, the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\n\nThere is also a weird quasi-romantic scene shoehorned in for no reason.\n\nGraphics:\n\nIt starts off with a hand-drawn cutscene, which I was completely on board with because it was artistic and different. Then as soon as you get control of your character, you are dropped in a 90's-era, "we just learned how to use textures" cgi landscape that reminds me of the old cd-roms I played as a kid. The effect is jarring, and gets more grating with each subsequent cutscene.\n\nI did like that they included a camera option that simulates boat-rocking. It adds to the feeling of being trapped on a creepy ship.\n\nText:\n\nThe text is well-written in both the various notes you find around the ship and in your journal, but the subtitles for the cutscenes are often misspelled or grammatically incorrect, and use an annoying serif font.\n\nMusic:\nThe game includes a free copy of the soundtrack, so you can enjoy all the boat creaking, wind whistling, and ghostly banging you want at your own leisure.\n\nIn short, this is a mediocre HOG with a clunky interface, inconsistent graphics, frustrating hidden object screens, bad translation errors, a contrived story, and too many vermin, that just happens to include a couple of enjoyable mini-games, a bonus scavenger hunt, and an interesting camera gimmick. That is simply not good enough for me to recommend it, when there are so many HOGs out there that do a much better job. I give it a 4/10.","May 5, 2015","false","3.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","3"

There are some problems with the pacing and the out-of-place minigames, but even they cannot put a dent into the great, eerie atmosphere that accompanies us from start to finish. In this regard, Night Mysteries outclasses many large-budget hidden object games.\n\nAs for gameplay, it relies on some really outdated hidden object mechanics, and I swear this is the first HOG I met where the bonus collectibles are promoted into a mandatory element. Still, some parts are clever and refreshing, and even the worst parts are more than tolerable, so, altogether, this is a really solid product for any HOG fan.","April 11","true","2.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","5"

You unfortunately miss your boat by 3 minutes and wander the harbor looking for another ride.  Meeting the Captain of another ship, he agrees to take you on also subtly informing you that they're holding cargo for an antique dealer. After meeting and greeting the crew you settling in your room and then fall asleep.

I found one puzzle impossible to solve without skipping, and I'm usually quite good at these! Likewise, the point-and-click adventuring is not easy. Luckily, you can use the hint key without penalty.\n\nDespite the difficult, it is fair. The ship is not very big, and you can wander back and forth without frustration until you think of a way to solve a problem.\n\nAlso nice is that the collectibles are actually part of the game. It's fun finding them on your own, and then looking for them more carefully in the end in order to finish.\n\nThe graphics, a mix of 3D models, gently swaying in the ocean ways, and drawn cut scenes, are terrific and capture the eerie mood very well. The story is cliché but told simply and without nonsense.\n\nUnfortunately, the game engine is a bit buggy. There were a few places where clicking the first time didn't register for me. Also, there are a few scenes where you have to use mouse gesturing to move through them. I found these buggy and frustrating experiences, and unlike the puzzles they are not skippable. I think they don't really have a place in this genre, and the game would be better without them.","February 21","true","3.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Instead of hand-drawn pictures, everything is in 3D. There's no way to rotate the camera or use this feature, so there game is still a common 2D HOG, with a bit of a graphics twist in it. It was hard to accept first, but I got used to it fast.\n\nAbout voices. There's no voice acting, just subtitles.

Some has a countdown timer and you have to do the same boring stuff for 3 minutes! It's fun for 10-20 secs but after that, you just want to finish it and move forward. Fortunately you can skip this parts after a minute or so. I found "find-by-name" mini-games sadistic and annoying. There are some puzzles which require specific skills from the player (not so causal) like getting water from the sea. It's really simple: click then hold it while you have to move your mouse up, in reality it's just not working. After a couple of tries I chose to skip them as well.\n\nAvoid this game.

What irritated me to no end was the fact that I was passing through loads of rooms with bloody fire extinguishers in them. Why am I getting a bucket and dipping it in the sea when I can use those?

A previous review had mentioned that there was no icon to indicate an item could be collected, so I was aware of that going into the game, but it was incredibly difficult to find necessary items. You had to click on a specific part of some items to be able to collect it/use it, and for items in hidden object scenes that need an extra step to find, it was nearly impossible to find it as you just have to click everywhere possible. When a new item is needed to move forward in the game, you need to backtrack and search everywhere possible to find either a new hidden object scene or some new area to interact with, again without an icon showing you an item you can suddenly interact with.
