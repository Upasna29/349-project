I'd say that game's mechanics are halfway from Street Fighter and BlazBlue: the game is linear just like SF, but there are nice additions like air-dashes, double jumps, faultless defence, (false) roman cancels. Also, a few characters use strange gameplay styles but none of them are screen invasive (like BlazBlue) and btw there still are common move combinations that will work on every char (with different outcomes of course) so also complete noobs may enjoy the game.\nAs for how much technical is the game, well, it IS technical, and you'll get to enjoy that a lot.\n\nNow, about the graphic there's not much to say, it's awesome. Character design is the best out there IMHO, animations are fluid and backgrounds are nice. Also, effects are not invasive, and that's really important for me.\n\nSound part may be tricky. Game's music belongs to the power metal genre ('80s style) and it's really good. I personally don't like power metal (actually I don't like the whole metal genre) but I have to say that the songs pair with the game so perfectly that even if you hate metal you may still enjoy that kind of background music when fighting.\n\nNow let's talk about flaws.\nGame design flaws: the tier list counts S (or even more) ranked chars (only Eddie's air kick actually) and E (or at least almost E) chars. For a fighting game a tier list going S+ > D-(E) is quite bad.\nGame port flaws: the game ported to steam is the same game that was ported to PC years ago, meaning there is no steam integration of any kind (and there never will be probably). While the game itself is a nice port, 2014 players may feel like something is missing.\n\nBonus time.\nEven if this game has no netplay you can play it online thanks to a fan made patch that enables a perl based netplay (with the necessary skills everyone can host a server) which works really well and, btw, after like more than a decade there is still people playing this awesome game online.","October 20, 2014","true","9.8"," 78 of 85 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","78","85","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/314030/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Fighting games are always hard to review, especially if you’re not that familiar with the genre, with maybe some exceptions like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter maybe. I’ll try and do my best to give you a proper review anyway.\n\nSo, Guilty Gear X2 was first released on PS2, and later released as X2 #Reload for the Xbox. It improved some of the game’s mechanics, while also adding new fighters and stages.\nWe’re actually talking about a ten year old game here and it’s the first time we’re seeing X2 #Reload on Steam.\nA 10 year old game… can you believe it ? Okay, it’s nothing we haven’t seen before; tons of old games have already been released on Steam but this GG is one of the few games to have actually aged very well. And that’s because it uses detailed 2D sprites that still look great to this day. Of course, games now use different and better techniques for 2D animation but it’s admirable to see how much effort and time was put into these graphics back then.\nThe gameplay obviously also remains the same. This isn’t the kind of game that gets you far with just button mashing, so you have to be able to pull off some decent moves in the later rounds. The controls are pretty much the same as any other fighter out there and plays like a dream with a controller, or a keyboard; your choice. Pressing Escape will exit the game so make sure you press Enter if you want to navigate through the menus. This was an issue for me the first time I started playing (I was hoping to pause the game) and it’s something that could have easily been implemented with a patch, but I doubt this will happen.\nThere are more than a few characters available to fight with and these are all weird and wacky characters with a lot of personality and each of them has their own fighting moves. They aren’t as memorable as some of the characters from the MK or SF series but still crazy enough to make them stand out in one way or another.\nThe game also has more than enough game modes available. These are as follows: Story (speaks for itself), Training (also speaks for itself), Versus (CPU or human opponent), M.O.M. (Medal Of Millionaires, where you can earn medals by performing combos), Survival (survive as long as you can) and Mission Mode (where you’re restricted or limited by set rules).\nI’ve only played parts of the story and a little bit of the other modes but I’m not skilled enough to finish anything yet. The more advanced fighters among us will probably have less trouble with this, I’m sure.\n\nI’ve talked a little about the graphics already, but these still looks gorgeous. Sure, nowadays the animations could use some extra frames in them but that’s about the only thing one could add or change in my opinion. Oh yeah, and maybe a widescreen option because this version is still shown in a 4:3 ratio, with black bars on the sides. The launcher does have some modern options in it, however, like pixel shaders, v-sync and the choice to play in 30 or 60fps.\nThe voice acting is all in Japanese, which is good for the hardcore fighting gamers, but a less obvious choice for the casual gamers that usually prefer English. But, let’s face it, it’s a fighting game so it’s not that there are very deep conversations to be found here and there’s still the text that is shown in English, of course. And the soundtrack has a lot of rock music in it which makes the whole package complete I guess.\n\nThe game can be played both off- and online and could be played for hundreds of hours if you really wanted too. Most people probably won’t get that far, but the extremists and completists might. There are quite a few unlockables like art and hidden characters that can be unlocked by just playing the single-player or any of the other modes. So there’s a lot of replay value here if you want to 100% everything.\n\nGuilty Gear X2 #Reload remains one of the better, but lesser known, fighters ever released. That naturally doesn’t have to mean anything. The game is made in such a way that a casual gamer can play a few rounds and still enjoy themselves but in reality it really is meant for the true fighting aficionados, no doubt about it. And even though I’m far from a fighting expert I still enjoyed my time with it. It's a game that has been faithfully ported.\n\n[Rating: 79/100]","September 14, 2014","true","6.3"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","0"

DUEL 1, LET'S ROCK!\nGuilty Gear XX #Reload (and all GG game series) is a 2D anime fighting game with metal soundtrack and it has interesting plot, good characters and also various references to metal and rock music what makes game pretty unique. There is a lot of singleplayer content such as "Gallery", "Arcade Mode", "M.O.M. (Medal of Millionaire)", "Survival Mode", "Mission Mode", Story Mode, "Training Mode" and, of course, "Vs CPU" and "Vs 2P".\n\nMostly important is that GG XX#Reload has pretty fast gameplay, nice graphics and animations, good balance, decent mechanic and interesting combat system about which I want to talk more. First, as you probably know, there is special attacks and "Overdrives". To perform overdrives and some attacks you need a "Tension" gauge. Also, player able to kill an enemy instantly by "Instant Kill", but if missed, player lose his tension guage. There is also "Psych Bursts" that can stop enemy's attack or give full tension by performing in a neutral state. Another special attack is "Roman Cancel" which can cancel enemy's move and require tension. All this allows to come up with a variety of strategies and tactics.\n\nFurthermore, you can unlock not just gallery arts, but also 2 secret characters (Justice and Kliff) and EX, Shadow (infinite tension) and Gold (characters become overpowered) versions characters and there are various ways. For example, to unlock Justice and Kliff player can beat Story mode or Mission Mode.\n\nIn addition, there is multiplayer mod for Steam version (see guide) which works fine.\n\nWhy else would I recommend it? Because #Reload is one of the best versions of GGXX and because there is no AC+R version for PC yet.","December 13, 2014","true","46.6"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","4"

Many iterations later, Slash, Accent Core, Accent Core Plus, Accent Core+R, Guilty Gear finally got a true sequel in the form of Guilty Gear Xrd.\n\nAnd yet, here I am still playing X2 #Reload. This game is by any means not even close to being balanced, nor as refined as later versions of X2, like say Slash or Accent Core, but I always keep coming back to it. I just like Guilty Gear back when it was a bit more simple, ya know? No Slash Backs, no Force Breaks, hell you can't even Throw Tech, no Blitz Shield, and no silly stuff like Danger Time and Hellfire. Just good ol' fashioned Guilty Gear with it's absurd gameplay, ridiculously awesome soundtrack and character designs, and thanks to this PC port, the first iteration of the series to have decent netplay, thanks to a fanmade patch.\n\nI would highly recommend this game if you consider yourself a fan of fighting games, I mean, you can't call yourself a fan of fighting games if you don't play a legendary series like Guilty Gear, and X2 #Reload was like the peak of the X2 series popularity. Even Daigo Umehara was playing X2 #Reload. You owe it to yourself to play this game. Sure it's outdated compared to Accent Core+R, but ya know, going back to the roots is always fun.","March 1, 2015","true","10.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dj_malloc/recommended/314030/","dj_malloc","Malloc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dj_malloc/","1185 products in account","I spent a hideously massive amount of time with this game when it was released for the original Xbox way back in the day. It's lovely. It's also ten years old, and it shows.\n\nThe quick and dirty tagline: If you purchase this on Steam, you are buying the 2004 PS2 console version of this game that automagically runs on your PC. Make no mistake though, this is the PS2 version. Nothing more, but also nothing less. That means no online play and even the button callouts are for a PS2 DualShock controller. Does that hurt the game? Honestly, not really. It was a great game then and it's great now, just don't go expecting much in the way of modern amenities. You're buying a classic.\n\nLet's get the cons out of the way right now:\n\n- No built-in online play. It's possible to use a third party program to do this, but it's not something that comes with the game. If your primary motivation for buying this is online matchmaking you very likely already know how to make this work, but if not, it's...a process, and it's not perfect.\n- The resolution's a tad funky. You're given a reasonable amount of settings options, but the fact of the matter is that you're basically running a standard-definition 4:3 aspect ratio game on a modern system that very likely has far surpassed those specifications. The game will technically run in fullscreen at 1080p and 60FPS, but there's going to be some pillarboxing involved, and (as with most games from this era that were console exclusive), there's some empty space at the top and bottom of the game as well. It's essentially a 4:3 square floating in the center of any given modern display. It's not awful, and it's certainly playable, but the game simply isn't going to make use of all your screen real estate.\n- Setting up the controls can be a bit of a pain. There's a handy program included with the game designed to do this, but it must be run outside of the game itself, after which you have to quit out and reboot the game proper. If you have  PC-compatible arcade stick, it's possible to map it to work with the (admittedly kinda weird) default arcade GGXX layout, but this will take a bit of patience. This can get doubly weird if you're like me and have an Xbox One controller plugged into the PC along with your stick; the game will assume the XInput controller is Player 1, and you have to manually remap the stick to be player 1 if that's what you want to use it for. It's not impossible or even particularly difficult, but it's quite a bit more involved than the usual in-game, press-this-button-to-map-it-to-this-move shennanigans.\n\nLet's go to the Pros:\n- This game's brilliant aesthetic style is peerless even relative to other games by the same company, and getting to play it in razor-sharp resolution brings out a lot of the astoundingly beautiful pixel art detail you never noticed on an old CRT screen. This is what high-budget, mega-creative fighting game character design looked like in the early aughts, long after SNK had dropped the ball but before Capcom had/has picked it back up again.\n- It runs great. Yes, it's a PS2 game port, yes tossing it in high res shows you that the much-vaunted "high resolution" sprites of the time...well, *weren't*, but you know what? You'll stop noticing the negatives about five seconds into actually playing the game. Outside of the odd screen size, the game runs absolutely perfectly. Everything is faithful, there's zero slowdown or other port-related weirdness, the controls are broken-glass sharp, and it's just an absolute blast to play.\n- There's quite a lot of content for single players. Even compared to modern fighting games like Street Fighter IV and King of Fighters XIII, there's a weirdly comprehensive story mode in GGX2#R that makes most everything else look weirdly anemic in comparison. Fully voiced (in Japanese) radio-drama style stories for every character in the game, a boatload of secrets, an art gallery, and tons of other goodies are all built into the game. The Steam version also comes with the full soundtrack in .mp3 format, which is a lovely touch.\n- The game itself holds up incredibly well. Guilty Gear was always something of an underdog series, but it has had (and continues to have) its die hard following for a very good reason: This game is fun as hell to play. Every character is entirely unique and they all have their own devoted mechanics to master, or work around if you're fighting them. Air dashing is a universal skill, one-hit-kill moves are possessed by every character without (somehow) making the game seem unbalanced, and everyone's got a giant mountain of personality to go along with their movesets. You've got a American playboy who fights with a cane sword, a pirate teenage girl who fights with an anchor bigger than she is, a witch rockstar who attacks you with her living hat, a corpse controlled by a liquid demon who can change shape at will, a 9' tall psychopath with a bag over his head who can teleport by opening doors in the background, and a bent-backwards down on his luck giggolo possessed by the ghost lady from The Ring (yes, really). That's just scraping the surface of this game's impressive roster. You will never be bored playing this, and the fact that the attention to detail runs so deep is just icing on the cake. None of the characters are throwaway gimmicks. Everyone has a personality, a story, a sometimes-incredibly-complicated moveset, and they all ooze style in a way few games can pull off.\\n- The rest of the package is what you'd expect. You've got training modes, Vs. modes, an Arcade mode, and a bunch of extras to poke around in. Again, if the idea of "Play the PS2 version of the game on my PC" sounds like a good deal to you, you'll get exactly what you were hoping for.\n\nAt the price they're asking, this game is worth picking up. It wasn't terribly long ago that the idea of a semi-obscure japanese fighting game appearing on Steam seemed like something of a pipe dream, but here we are. With any luck, more will follow. In the meantime, if you're a fan you've probably already picked this up. If you're not a fan, though, this is a *great* place to start with these kinds of games. Highly recommended with some slight reservations regarding technical aspects.","November 23, 2014","true","3.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It's been ages since I've played a 2D Fighting Game. I actually remember this game from old arcades and I'd say Guilty Gear X2 is one of the best of its examples. Flashy animations, original moves, tricky combinations, great character concepts and even including a storyline for each and every character, this game has always been one of my favorites of the genre. It's tricky to follow the storyline without some research though; my only regret about the series is that no one made an actual anime or OVA for it yet, so understading the references and character dialogues is a bit tough. Oh, whatever! Grab it, play it, abuse it, enjoy it! It's old school fun for a sunday afternoon.","May 15, 2015","true","5.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

If you Feel a Fear of your wallet having a Momentary Life, display a Burly Heart and Make Oneself press that cart button. This game's Elegance graces your very Existence, and without it, you shouldn't Keep Yourself Alive II continue your Simple Life.\nspoilered for bad puns : (\n\nThis game looks, plays, sounds, and is amazing. It has that confusing lore that rewrites itself with every rendition of the game. Perfect. GGXX has a lot of systems going on for it. You've got the burst gauge, guard gauge, tension meter, negative penalty (aka coward penalty), roman cancels, instant kills, faultless defense (guarding with tension meter), whatever it is Robo-Ky has going on for him, etc. Maybe that doesn't sound like much, but back in the day that was kinda ridiculous.\n\nThough this isn't the latest installment in the GGX2 set, it's still a good one. It's just about the last one before the first Accent Core, with GGXX Slash succeeding it. Isuka doesn't count. There's not that much wrong with this game since it has a netplay patch (that includes a color editor, and color editors are always more important than the fighting game itself.) Unfortunately, the netplay patch has problems with Xinput controllers since it's a really old patch, so be wary of that, but the vanilla game without the mod handles them well.\n\nNow this Terrible, Terrible Review might make it seem like I have a favorable bias towards fighting games, but that's because it's completely true, and this is one of the main games that caused it. Also, be sure to try out Guilty Gear Xrd, which is currently not (and probably never will be) on PC.\n\n~ Til Next Time\nSantana","January 18, 2015","true","26.8"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","65","11","17","7","0"

Has many Counter Moves which makes him dangerous to Attack and a Kusarigama for wide and safe Attacks.

I know that the English voice acting was never done so that is why everyone speaks in Japanese (minus the announcer who, oddly enough, only speaks in English), but not being able to understand anything that any of the characters ever say does get rather frustrating after a while (especially since there are no English subtitles in the game to nullify this translation issue). That, and the sound of little Japanese girls constantly producing high-pitched anime-tier screams at the top of their lungs when both attacking or harmed (see: May) makes me want to deafen myself after like three seconds of hearing it. But that is probably just because I hate hearing children in general.\n\nI also do not like the one resolution in the game being a mere 640 x 480. That is far too small, so any Steam notification that shows up will cover up a huge chunk of the screen until the box goes away. That, and the in-game Steam Overlay is rather microscopic and unusable at such a small resolution, since everything is scaled to a size that looks best at the resolution that your computer is currently set to, leaving everything uncomfortably close and difficult to navigate unless your resolution is, for whatever reason, set to 640 x 480. Again, that might just be a personal problem, since I am too used to playing at a resolution size of 1280 x 720 or greater.\n\nControl setup issues, Japanese-only dialogue complaints and fixed resolution gripes aside, this is still a wonderful game all around. The various game modes, many character stories to play through and other included features give this game huge (if not infinite) replay value, depending on what your attention span is typically like. Once I relearn the controls, I am certain that I will end up getting lost in this game like I was back in my high school days (with Guilty Gear XX Λ Core Plus for the PSP).\n\nOverall, I give this game an 8/10.","November 28, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The problems:\n\n*no support for higher resolutions, or a fullscreen window\n*no subtitles for the extensive in-game spoken Japanese (and at least two characters' names on the select screen are in untranslated kanji)\n*a wonky menu system (be aware that "quit" simply returns you to the splash screen; the escape key, on the other hand, immediately shuts down the game regardless of where you are)\n*bizarre default key bindings (while it's easy to figure out that Space acts as "start," you'll need to hit, for some reason, the U key to select menu options)\n*following on from that, far more fiddling than necessary to make an Xbox pad usable- you can get through most of it with the Joy2pad-looking interface in the game's setup utility, but be aware that the setup program won't recognize input from the left and triggers, which have to be bound manually as 1ZMIN and 1ZMAX respectively\n*and following on from that, the in-game key binding screen is worse than useless, since it only displays Playstation inputs (circle, X, triangle, square) and the player is left to find on their own which arbitrary keys these have been assigned to\n\nI have no doubt I'll be able to enjoy it eventually, but hopefully this review will others make a purchasing decision or get the game to work properly after buying it.","September 26, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Most of the basic special moves consist of a few quarter or half circles and maybe one or two buttons, so they're easy to remember. Most of the characters also move very fast as well, making dodging attacks plausible.\n\nI'm not even particularly that great at fighting games, but I still manage to beat just about all of my friends at this game without resorting to any sort of mindless button mashing.\n\nThough the visuals are a bit grainy compared to more modern 2D fighting games, they still look fantastic, and have great background detail. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack. I had the entire OST on my ipod for months, consisting mostly have shreading metal music with a few other genres specific to certain characters.\n\nThe character selection is also great. I've had a hard time finding a character that was too overpowered or too much better than the rest, however I do have a couple person underpowered ones.\n\nI'll be honest, I haven't followed much of the overall story line. That's not why I really play fighting games. I've been told if you actually follow it, it's not too bad, but it certainly couldn't hold the game on its own.\n\nGamepad compatibility is a bit spotty. It's not too difficult to get a 360 or PS3 controller to work with the game, but it's not always easy. For some reason the game doesn't recognize the controller at all, and I have a hard time understanding how anyone can play a fighting game with a keyboard.\n\nOverall it's a fantastic, fast paced, fighting game. I recommend this. Also check out Blazblue, a rather similar but also different game.","November 27, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/314030/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account",""Why should you have to walk all the way over to your Xbox to play Guilty Gear?"\nGuilty Gear is a fighting game series that's by Sammy--and not by Capcom or SNK. Which is weird. It's known for it's beautiful animation and unique characters, and is one of the more modern fighting games. Guilty Gear XX #Reload is essentially an add-on to Guilty Gear XX/X2. I was a big fan of the original X2, and it seems that all of the Guilty Gear fans play #Reload, even though it isn't out in America, save for on XBox. Well, I didn't have an Xbox, and I didn't plan on buying it, a new Guilty Gear, and a new controller (Xbox Controller? Ew.). So I looked for an alternative. Importing it for the Ps2 was out. So all that was left was the PC Version, which, I, er, just happened to get for free..somehow *wink*.\n\nGRAPHICS : 10/10\nIn case you haven't been looking, Guilty Gear has some of the best 2-D graphics I've seen on the Ps2. The characters are high-resolution, the effects and animation are great, and..yeah. The graphics, like most 2D fighters today, are anime-ish. But yeah, the graphics are really great. The only thing I've seen outdo it is probably Street Fighter III: Third Strike, but it's still amazing. On the PC version, the sprites look a little less clean, and the character's eyes look weirder, but I think that's actually because I'm playing up near the screen, rather than a couple of feet away from it on my Ps2.\n\nSTORY : 6/10\nUhh..there's a story here, I just can't find it. I'm pretty sure the story is about giant robots or something..but even in story mode, I really can't find much. Here's a tip: If you've been playing 2D fighters for their awesome stories...you may want to stop.\n\nMUSIC : 7/10\nThe music in Guilty Gear is all heavy metal. It's pretty good, I guess, but in reality, it matters if you like this sort of stuff--and I really don't. Even if I did, though, I can't imagine myself humming these tunes in my head like I do with Street Fighter II's themes. Well, at least it's not music that I actually mind listening to while beating people up. The sound quality on the PC version remains the same.\n\nCONTROL : 10/10\nThe control in the game is really responsive, and this is definitely necessary, because it's really, really fast-paced, and you have to be able to pull off complex moves in a split second. With that said, don't expect to actually play this on a keyboard. You need a joypad, whether it be an arcade stick, a 360 controller, a SmartJoy--something.\n\nGAMEPLAY : 8/10\nGuilty Gear's gameplay isn't all that different from other 2D fighters, although there are some minor changes. In Guilty Gear, your characters walk really slowly, so you can double tap << to backflip/hop or >> to run. The jumping is really floaty compared to other fighters, you don't just jump and hit the ground, you take off and kind of hover before hitting the ground. Also, you can double jump--not something really common in fighters. Your super meter is called Tension, and you can do a lot of things with it besides doing super moves. You can do the faultless defense, which is just blocking, but instead of losing a little HP, you lose tension. There's also the roman cancel, which lets you cancel at any time in a combo, letting you start up a new one, but it costs half of your tension. Neat.\n\nThe characters in Guilty Gear are pretty amazing. They range from a 9-foot dude with a scalpel to a a crazy posessed dude. All of them are pretty memorable, and that's important, because there are plenty of fighting games that have 40-something characters that are all look the same with slight differences, and nothing that stands out about them. Not only that, though, the characters all play differently. Even characters who appear the same do. Speaking of which, RELOAD adds one new character from X2.\n\nAfter playing the game for a solid amount of time, however, I am kind of disappointed. Not because of the lack of quality for the game, but that I kind of fell into the hype of people saying how great RELOAD was, when, in reality, it's a pretty minor upgrade. I've definetly noticed some minor changes, but they're just minor. I'm glad I didn't pay 60+ bucks to import this, because it'd be essentially buying the same game twice. It's pretty obvious why hardcore GG fans play Reload; because they're hardcore GG fans. They want the most balanced, fine-tuned version they can get. It's like playing Street Fighter 2: The Warrior Within when you could play Street Fighter 2: Champion Edition. They're pretty similar, but why not go with the one with the frills? What I'm saying is, if you're like me, and you had X2 for Ps2, you don't need to go crazy trying to find a method to play RELOAD..but other than that, this is a damn solid fighter. Invite some friends over and have a party.\n\nAnyway, the main changes about the PC version...there's no online play, first of all. Gotta go for the XBOX if you want that. Next, sometimes the loading times can be a pain in the ♥♥♥. When you start a round of Arcade Mode, the first person you fight will have like, a 10-15 second loading times. These loading times also happen in training mode. Other than that, it's pretty much the same game. Who coulda thunkit?\n\nOVERALL (NOT AN AVERAGE) : 8\nIf you really must play Reload, try to, uh, er, "find" this game online. If you have an Xbox, and some cash, and you like Guilty Gear, you'll want to go with that version instead.\n\n\nReviewer's Score: 8/10","May 29, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However, this new port is a complete waste of money.\n\nThe controls are absolutly screwed, both on keyboard or with a controller. Nothing really makes sense and pulling out the really good combos is near impossible unless you sink hours into learning them buy trial and error, as the training mode only tells you how to do them with the original playforms controller.\n\nThe story is still as broken as ever, you will go from incredibly boring and easy fights straight to one so impossible you can only reasonably beat it with a handful of characters and only through luck and trying for, literally, days. Once you've done it, it's hardly satisfying as well.\n\nBasically buy it if you enjoy being frustrated and disappointed. If you're knew, buy one of the more recent fighters that have been created by a competent team. If you're a masochist and hate yourself and your sanity, get this now and play it until you're bleeding from your ears.","November 14, 2014","false","2.1"," 5 of 30 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","5","30","0","0"

There are actually tons of versions of this game already, the original, #Reload, Slash, Accent Core, and a few others. While not the most balanced, this is still the best, and the closest to what Xrd's gameplay is like from my experience with an early build of it's console version.\n\nSince this is Guilty Gear, one of the big selling points is the soundtrack. Guilty Gear is full of references to rock and metal bands, and the soundtrack is amazingly original and just overall great.\n\nNow for story, X2 is the second GG entry to have a full story mode, with only GGX Plus before it. It follows a visual novel  form of story telling, which BlazBlue fans may be familiar with, where some dialouge choices here and there and loses/winning and how long it takes you to finish a fight can affect the story path. Plot wise, this game doesn't really have too much importance int he overall story of the series, but it does help develop each character. Every character has their own story, which is mostly unique, with a few crosses into the other character's stories here and there. One of the main themes of the series is "Chaos", and having a non linear story and no real overall story in this game really helps get that across.\n\nControls are fairly easy to set up if you take your time to do so. I play with a PS3 controller with "Better DS3 tool", set to Direct Input mode. Just set up the controller in the config and everything should work fine.\n\nMy only real problem with the Steam release of #Reload, is that before the game became available on Steam, it was on GOG, and the GOG version supported both PC and Mac, while this version only works on PC. I doubt that'll be a problem for most people, but it's just something I thought I should bring up.\n\nOverall, as a long time fan of Guilty Gear, I highly reccomend #Reload if you're trying to get into the series, or if you just need a new fighter with a wide variety of characters and play style.","November 26, 2014","true","67.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a crazy cast of characters and a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome soundtrack plus some of the best gameplay that puts even newer fighting games to shame.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zysets/recommended/314030/","zysets","They're Hella Weak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zysets/","65 products in account","Let me start with the fact that I've been a Guilty Gear fan for just over a decade now, and I assume any fans of the series planning to buy this don't need much detail, and that newer fans might likely get it in an effort to get into the series before the release of Xrd on PS3/PS4 or just because they want a new fighter to play.\n\nThe game itself is my personal favorite version of Guilty Gear X2. There are actually tons of versions of this game already, the original, #Reload, Slash, Accent Core, and a few others. While not the most balanced, this is still the best, and the closest to what Xrd's gameplay is like from my experience with an early build of it's console version.\n\nSince this is Guilty Gear, one of the big selling points is the soundtrack. Guilty Gear is full of references to rock and metal bands, and the soundtrack is amazingly original and just overall great.\n\nNow for story, X2 is the second GG entry to have a full story mode, with only GGX Plus before it. It follows a visual novel  form of story telling, which BlazBlue fans may be familiar with, where some dialouge choices here and there and loses/winning and how long it takes you to finish a fight can affect the story path. Plot wise, this game doesn't really have too much importance int he overall story of the series, but it does help develop each character. Every character has their own story, which is mostly unique, with a few crosses into the other character's stories here and there. One of the main themes of the series is "Chaos", and having a non linear story and no real overall story in this game really helps get that across.\n\nControls are fairly easy to set up if you take your time to do so. I play with a PS3 controller with "Better DS3 tool", set to Direct Input mode. Just set up the controller in the config and everything should work fine.\n\nMy only real problem with the Steam release of #Reload, is that before the game became available on Steam, it was on GOG, and the GOG version supported both PC and Mac, while this version only works on PC. I doubt that'll be a problem for most people, but it's just something I thought I should bring up.\n\nOverall, as a long time fan of Guilty Gear, I highly reccomend #Reload if you're trying to get into the series, or if you just need a new fighter with a wide variety of characters and play style.","November 26, 2014","true","67.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I particularly enjoyed the choice of modes available, as well as a standard arcade affair you can play through a scripted story route for each character, a survival mode, a coin-collecting mode called MOM, a mission mode where you can take on a series of preset conditions, among others.\n\nThe AI is highly variable, mostly manageable according to your personal settings, however the last fight in Arcade mode against I-No can be, and often is, extremely trying, and may be off-putting for many players. By and large though, a strong single-player experience, though a venerable treat in the multiplayer stakes.

Downside is the lack of specials that each character has. Some characters have way more specials than others. Tons of content, this includes modes as arcade, Vs, M.o.M(?) and a story mode with most characters involved.\n\nGraphics 8/10 - Beautiful and flashy attacks with amazing insta-kill attacks that kill your opponent with style. Amazing sprite work that feels energetic and is animated to perfection.\n\ncontrols 10/10 - Nothing about this seem off. I fight using a keyboard and it still feels great.  This game will work with all fightsticks and all controllers (ps3 to if you use a xbox 360 controller emulator)\n\nStory 6/10 - As someone new to the Guilty Gear universe i feel i wasnt told anything about characters, sure there is a bio when selecting a character in story mode but it doesnt tell me anything about what characters did before this game. I haven't beat the whole story mode yet but out of the 3 fighters I used I was starting to see a pattern. (To be fair fighting games dont need super complicated plots, but a little clarity of characters would be nice.)\n\nMusic 10/10 - This ♥♥♥♥♥ so ♥♥♥♥ing good.

This is the game that set the standards for balance among tons of series and is referred to. There are no useless/joke characters, there are plenty that lend themselves to different gameplay preferences, and there are no real infitite loops or exploits thanks to easy to use mechanics like dust and faultless defense so newer players won't find themselves getting stuck and losing due to a hit making it through. Outside of that, the rest of what makes the series famous is here and holds true. Really cool 80's rock vibe for the soundtrack, and a cast of bizarre and over the top characters. That alone makes it worth it, so it's a double bonus that the gameplay matches up with how great everything else is. This is definitely a must have for a fighter's library.\n\nfyi this is a straight port of the xbox version, and a very good one at that.","July 31, 2015","true","57.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a big fan of the GGXX concept "Badass fighting mechanics meets badass rock and ♥♥♥♥in' roll!!" If your a fan of fighting games and love metal/rock this is a mest own. The movement is so fluent and clean it's insane. I do have a few cons towards this title aswell, such as all the women in this game all are either a walking pair of boobs, or are nine. They also all seem to have been attacked by clothes wolves, because they're down to rags barely covering there nipples and ♥♥♥♥♥s, but if you can get passed the attire of the women oyu're left with a fantastic fighter with a very diverse list of characters.\n\nI do have one more note that my joystick on my fight pad would not work with this game but I managed to work around by using Joytokey and and using that program for my fighting stick. a little inconvenient, but not all that terrible, and it also could just be me.","August 17, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
