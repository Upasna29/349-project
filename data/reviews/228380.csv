That's just mental.\nIn the actual state, you can drive and tune 3 different cars and take part in both races (on gravel and tarmac tracks, straight and reverse route) and mosh pits (in 3 different arenas) in different weather and time of the day. There is also a figure-8 jump race. You can race against up to 23 opponents.\n\nThis is the new generation Flatout.\n\nEDIT: as of 2/12/14, the game is still poorly optimized.I know it's still in an alpha state, and good thing the introduction of multiplayer, new cars and a WiP track, but please, if a dev will ever read this, focus on optimizing the game: I have a FX-9370 and 2x ASUS R9 270X in Crossfire and with medium settings, 20 cars, 1920x1080, the framerate sits between 30 and 50 FPS.","January 14, 2014","true","6.9"," 1,196 of 1,302 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","196","1","0","36"

Lot of things have changed. More cars and tuning possibilities. New graphics ect. (read update reports).\n\n-The game doesnt feel the same now. (No... It's even better after new updates)\n-Graphics are nice and smooth now. Better than it was.\n-Car physics still needs bit of a work to do but the feel of chaos is intense again.\n-Online gaming is lot smoother and less laggy than it was\n\nBUT.... Devs had a lot of work to get that new stuff to work and now they can focus on polishing it and releasing a new content. Oh and I almost forgot! New team racing mode feels really refreshing and fun. Im sorry that I crashed in to my teammates couple of time and they ended into drive in bonfires, but I lost the control of my car... :P\n\nThis really is a really good game at this stage, but need a lot of work to do before finished! I will highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to drive!\n\nMy older review below:\n\nGreat physichs! Beautiful graphics! Extremely fun to play! Lots.... and I mean LOTS of car parts and trash flying! (<-In a nutshell) This game is an experience that reminds me a bit of first Flatout, but is so much more. Control of the car feels good and theres lots of potential to be a game of the year. In a 24 player race after two laps theres so much trash and car wrecks on the road that makes it hard to get to the goal or avoid crashing. And when you crash and stop others behind you can hit you hard and it might be the end of the race for you. AI is really good and it makes mistakes as well and its fun to watch them crashing when you gain better position. They drive pretty good too and its not so simple thing to be #1. Derby is fun but I prefer racing more. In a derby the cars will be totally rasins after the round. Even too much if you are too serious but at the end it really doesent matter. Its so much fun anyway. In the early access theres now 2 race tracks, 2 cars and a derby arena. It isnt much but I still keep playing. This feels so fresh and welcoming after all crappy car games and NFS games what cant give you anything new.

I saw the Sneak Peek 2.0 and i loved it! Remembering the good old times with Flatout i thought to my self "This is what i want and i will support it.", so i bought the "Early Access Game. And for a while it was good.\n\nBut since we are in a "Early Access Game" things can change completley. Im sitting here and watching this Slideshow from screenshots out of the game today and i ask my self "Where is all that stuff from the screenshots that BUGBEAR is showing and advertising?!?".\nSince the grand "Overhaul" of the whole game engine and concept, this game turned in to a racing simulator. There are no more chrashes like on the screenshots. No flying physics particles and parts or wheels. There is no flying ragdolls or cardeformations like on these Screenshots you are looking at. The whole game is stripped of this. It is a bad unfinished racing simulator where you get penalties when you touch the gras on the side of the road.  It is hard as hell and BORING as ♥♥♥♥!\n\nIt turned from a fun carnage wreckfest in to a boring Simulator.\n\nThe new engine has a problem with NVIDIA cards of the 700 series. The whole screen flickers and makes the game almost unplayable. This issue is reported more than 7 months ago from many people, NO change in this direction til today. There are Forumposts from people who have older cards of the 600 generation, they cant even play this garbage with playable framerates.\n\nI dont understand (well actualy i do) why Bugbear still shows these Screenshots here. There is nothing like this in the game at all. Exept the screenshots from the Sneak Peek 2.0 but the Sneek Peak is nothing like the real game today. This is also something that puzzles me, why dont they say that the Sneak Peek 2.0 is nothing like the real game. Why dont they correct this missunderstanding and make a Sneak Peek 3.0. The 2.0 Version is not even the same engine as the new one. I is a straight out LIE!\n\nI understand that it still is unfinished and that things will change in the future and all the bugs i mentioned will disapear but the game like they are showing on these Screenshots and in the Sneak Peek 2.0 does not exist.\n\nMy final verdict:\n\nDon't buy this game if you wanted a fun racer with tonns of chrashes and carnage.\nDon't buy this until they finish their work.","April 11","false","17.3"," 151 of 180 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","151","180","4","9"

I mean, just ramming into someone is easy but what is the motivation behind it? You don't actually become better driver by doing it. It's more likely you just ruin your own race when the cars get stuck due to the 'glue effect'. If you want to wreck the cars, there are derby races for it.\n\nIn addition, I'd like to point out that the fun in racing isn't only about the results. Racing against someone who drives approximately as fast as you is more rewarding than dominating a race. I once got to race wheel-to-wheel with someone on the Tarmac track for almost two whole laps, and despite finishing second, that was one of the highlights of my online racing career. No stupid ramming, just cars overtaking each other with only minor banging of wheels, with both drivers leaving enough space to keep the racing neat and tidy  :)\n\nThat is what this game should be about. Wreckfest offers a good framework for clean racing with its driving physics, but also with its damage model: the cars can undergo a few collisions with essentially no loss of speed or drivability.\n\nThis is what many racing games such as iRacing lack. They can have better physics but the cars may become undrivable after a small contact. In addition, racing is not bound to tarmac circuits, but takes place on several terrain types, such as mud and sand.","November 29, 2014","true","635.8"," 186 of 247 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","186","247","2","20"

Soon it's failed development will surpass the development time of every Flatout game combined. This May 2016 update contains little new, because the game contains litte new.\n\nFirst, let me totally clear. This game is now nothing like the Flatout Racing games that they sold it as back in 2014. As it stands today, it's a playable mess. The only thing worthwhile I've gotten out of was the Sneak Peek 2.0.\n\nGraphics are solid, but dated despite the new engine and performance is dreadful across the board. The confusion of an arcade destruction racer drunkenly switching to a clean racing sim style game in late development has left the game playing like crap. Gone is the delightful destruction, but the physics are sub-par for a clean racing sim, and the change in collision physics mean you can be t-boned and then pushed around the track for entire laps incapable of escape except by reseting.\n\nAnd about those big engine changes and the updates to clean racing sim. They're weak excuses at best, and damned lies most likely. It's the latest in a very long stream of weak rationales offered up by the developers for why they've done little and released less. Around the time of my first major review, the excuse was major overhauling because people wanted the final game to keep the 24 person races featured in the earliest releases. (Apparently only there for stress testing and not originally intended for release). They've released more excuses for not making cars than they have cars.\n\nThis developers have adopted a 'take the money and wander off drunkly' approach. They haven't utterly abandoned the game, they were prepared with a shameless cash grab upate announcement for the Steam Summer Sale.\n\nDon't hold out hope and don't make excuses. The game has been in development for four years. In early access for two years. It only took two years to make Flatout 2. This isn't some first time indie dev, Bugbear's previous titles have easily grossed over 100 million dollars in sales. They don't deserve your money, or mine. I can't get mine back, so I'll keep coming back and updating my review. I'll have to add a video special in another two years, once this game has taken as long as all of the Flatout games Bugbear made, COMBINED.\n\nBugbear used to make good games, but their last full release (Ridge Racer Unbounded) was a disaster that took six years development. Hop over and look at how it turned out. The reviews are strangely prophetic as Wreckfest tries to be a strange mix of racing sim and destruction, the same poorly handling blend described in Ridge Racer Unbounded's numerous reviews.","October 1, 2015","false","1.3"," 104 of 130 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","104","130","6","0"

Crazy ©™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cptcrazy/","74 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMy probelm with this game is that in every way it is not worth $30. I put in about $5 when it was in kickstarter and it's totally worth that but anyone who paid $30 got ripped. They will never finish this game, it was their toy, and now that they have made some money on what is now an outdated game, they will do what they have done with other games and move on. It's a shame, but it's true.\n\nHOWEVER, this game could be a ton of fun with very little work involved. make the game as-is right now but add the ability to download from a third party, cars and tracks and for gods sake fix the damn MP to function. Every time i join a race I'm all psyched thinking "i have a ping of 50 this race should be incredible" only to be disappointed when the screen constantly flutters and my car jumps around on the track and i have momentary loss of all control over the car for a half second at a time.\n\nEven more idiotic is the control scheme. they have (what i can only imagine) is gear selections for someone with an H shifter (6 gears+ reverse) however, there is no clutch binding, rendering that useless, and if you go with some sort of sequential, you might as well just select automatic, because the shifts are so slow I could complete a lap around one of the Oval tracks before someone could shift from reverse to 5th gear and back... just kinda sad. it's like grandma is sitting in the passenger seat trying to shift the gears for you. There is no real support for axis controls. The throttle only really gets recognized at about 50% anything before that makes the engine do funny stuff like not work or sputter or just go full throttle, the steering axis seems to be the only one that works, and I'm pretty sure if you set an axis for handbrake it doesn't work at all. All of which the axis cannot be calibrated. This goes for any controller, xbox controller, wheel, doesn't matter, it just doesn't work well.\n\nLastly, The soft body physics were supposed to be the spotlight of the game yet they are an embarassment to anyone in the animations world because it's so terrible and fake. The cars deform, but not realistically. Watch some video's of Beam.NG that is true car deformation. This game should have that, but instead it is as if your car is build from some kind of metal that after it gets hit with "x" amount of force it turns into putty and then back hard. It's laughable, and somwhat comical at times, but to be honest I would rather the frame break or a wheel fall off than to have some warped up car with two wheels still able to drive at full speed even though the engine is bent at a 45° angle and would not function any longer. Yes it's supposed to be a goofy game, but how goofy do we really want it to be?\n\nThat brings up another point. The devs brag about a tire model to make it realistic yet show no concern to make the game realistic. I think the devs got lost somewhere and didn't know what to do, and to be honest I think it was when they started selling the game. I think they said "heck with making what we started, let's just conform to our target market" and that tarket market is somewhere between chimps on cocaine and Sim racers looking to goof off, which would actually be a great discription of how this game is made. Some parts are super awesome, other parts seem to have came out of a coloring book.\n\nI'm just not sure what this game is or isn't supposed to be and every time you go to mention an issue with the game on any forum, you will be blasted for questioning it. I don't see how so many people can drink the kool-aid thinking this game will be finished when it took nearly a year for a single update to drop on this game. Let's face it a year between updates means they don't care anymore, regardless of what they post on their website.","September 15, 2015","false","77.2"," 111 of 143 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","111","143","6","32"

A game like "The Crew" uses less right now. (The beta version)\nComputer AI can be a bit douchy from time to time.\nThe variety of cars\nNot a great racing game (But a god damn good wrecking game)\n\nNotes:\nThis game is in my opinion the spirital successor to Destruction Derby 2 and Test Drive: Eve of Destruction.\nI would recommend you using a controller or a steering wheel. Playing with a keyboard is no fun.\nAlways have manly liquor near you when you play this game.

The game used to be real fun, you could load it up get straight into an online race and race and smash your way around the track!!  So great!!\n\nNow the devs seem to have implemented some type of rpg career type mode in the MP!!!  This means that you start off with a slower less powerful car and race against others with better faster cars.  Your car will become damaged now and you have to finance the replacement of new parts.  It seem you get most money from playing singe-player.  So back to that mode to get some money to be able to go back in multiplayer.\n\nWhy would devs make it like this?\n\nA lot of people just want to online race, not screw about replacing body parts and having the other people on the start line having faster cars!!!\n\nIf the devs realise the error of their way I will rewrite this review, but this mechanic in the game completly breaks the game.","November 22, 2015","false","18.3"," 244 of 345 people (71%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","71","244","345","19","18"

What happened to you Bugbear? I bought this game under the promise of getting the next Flatout game, from the original devs. The original alpha build was fantastic fun, with an emphasis of destruction of vehicles and unpredicatable car mayham. It was an absolute blast. What happened afterwards baffles me. I have no idea what happened to the devs and what happened to this game. The physics have completely changed, now making destruction minimal and not very fun. The arcadey fun racer has turned into a pseudo racing sim. Its been 2 years and next to nothing has been added.

You gave us Flatout, probably the greatest, most fun racing game series of all times that conquered hearts of many, including mine. For me Flatout 2 will always be the one and only out there.\nWhen GameSpy support was shut down and multiplayer became nomore, people almost forgot about you, yet kept playing your games. The fans found a way to play online even after the official online support was cut off. You know what it's called? Devotion. And also approval, it reflects the quality of your product, of your hard work that's been put into it to deliver. A silent thankful tribute to what you once did. You actually managed to do something incredible back then. Then after several years you came out of nowhere with NCG and made such a hype with this new project of yours, which was understandable, people remembered who gave them Flatout and supported you with EA. I heard you raised what, a couple millions at least?.. NCG was supposed to become a spiritual continuation, was supposed to become the new Flatout. But from the very first look at it, it was clear that something was wrong, at least for me. Something was terribly wrong. The far the worse, for the reasons unknown you've made that weird decision to overhaul the engine. Why, who asked for it? Did you do it in order to be able to have 24 players, i heard? Why, why such a need for such a mess on a track, whose idea was it? I think i know. That's a step towards the quantity over quality, which is never good. People on forums talk from your name. You know who i'm talking about, yes. Same people. All the time, everytime.\nWhy couldn't you just stick to the good old Flatout concept of yours? NCG doesn't have to be EXACTLY like your old games, but it's become clear enough that you don't know yourselves where you're going with it, you're completely lost. Your game is neither a hardcore sim nor a fun arcade. And let's be honest, your fans just wanted the new Flatout. Including myself. Why couldn't you just stick to what you knew how to do like nobody else and decided to re-invent a wheel, will always remain mystery. Your community tore itself apart due to your highly controversial decisions. And now look at it. All that's left from the communty now is a tiny group of people. One and a half person play your game, servers are empty and deserted, i heard. The very same people who write on the forums under EVERY SINGLE POST that  rightfully criticize your unfinished, ugly mess, because there are no other words for your... creation, if it may be called so.  And they behave aggressively. And it's noone's fault but yours. You've had it all, all you had to do is follow your own instructions, but no! You've failed your own concept! The key to success was right under your nose but you turned away.\nI loved you, but will refrain from buying your products in future, if there will be any, and for what you did i give you another negative review.

As with most of my reviews this is purely based on my experience with the single-player portion of the game.Next Car Game: Wreckfest is an incredibly good racing game and even in early access there's plenty to do. The main selling point of the game is its softbody physics which are pretty much to die for but I'll get into that a bit more later in the review.\n\n+Great graphics on max settings, not sure what it looks like with lower settings\n+You can compete with up to 23 other cars\n+Racing mode is great fun, on some tracks in particular it becomes less of a race and more of a survival challenge on the longer races which I love\n+Demolition Derby is a lot of fun\n+The tracks are well thought out and are enjoyable many more times than just once\n+Currently five cars with a few customisation options, not sure if there will be more apart from the Deluxe edition car\n+An incredibly enjoyable Tech Demo, its good enough to be sold on its own (it isn't of course, you get it for buying the game)\n+The previously mentioned soft body physics. They're incredibly realistic and it's so satisfying smashing in to another car and seeing the damage you've done to it. My one complaint about the soft body physics is the fact that it stretches some of the textures sometimes so you can often end up with an incredibly odd looking driver, it really doesn't have any impact on your enjoyment, it just bothers me a bit\n+Plenty of different camera views\n+Your car can only take so much damage! As different parts of your car stop working your car will get worse and worse until eventually and often inevitably you get wrecked\n+Things in the environment get damaged such as walls and skid marks are left on tarmac, especially in a Demolition Derby\n+Good value for money\n\n-Feels a tad too easy at times\n\nVerdict:\n9\n\nAlready a great game I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a full 10, or at the very least 9.5, when everything gets implemented at full release.\n\nEl K.","December 14, 2014","true","4.4"," 91 of 124 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","91","124","4","0"

Since then, there's been a major patch, plus a lot of little ones, that have improves the difficulty of the game and added more variation. You can no longer simply hold the gas down the entire time and braking in tight curves is needed to avoid crashed. Speaking of crashes, the crashing and damage has been upgraded as well and now you can really feel the imact of the crashes. You no longer flip as easily as before the big patch, but it is still possible to roll in the right circumstance.\n\nIt is still early access, but I think it is worth the money. I've certainly put in enough hours to enjoy the game.\n\nOne last note: If you see any review from June 30th to July 7th or so, ignore it. The physics engine has changed a lot since the June 30th update. Cars are easier to control, crashes have more weight to them, cars are damaged in more extreme ways.

They are redoing the entire core of the game itself. Also if you browse their forums, and browse their blog there is many upon many updates. Don't you think they find their own lack of updates disturbing? Thats why they have been teasing new tracks, new cars, and many other things. They havey an entire hallway dedicated to tracks. People just need to give them time because with this new Early access it throws many things in the Game making process off. Instead of making just 1 final build that people will play and update off of that final build. They have to make several final builds, and give those to the early access. They are trying to release a "final game" as their next update. Also if you check their forums, you'd find out why there has been lack of updates. They have cars falling from the sky, they also have things that would make a car halfway through a wall. Guys be Patient, i've seen what is coming (via the forums) and this wait will be worth it.\n\nThis physics are already amazing, the cars and the tracks they have can make you playing for hours. Yes, you can only play so much with 5 cars, and i believe 7 tracks.\n\nJust think of it this way, they know the update is taking long. Don't you think they will put more and more things in this next build to make up for it? Also, once they re-do the engine, updates WILL be much more frequent.\n\nJust realize people. The base of the game is what takes the longest in game making.\n\nThis is a recommended buy!\n\nAs for those who obviously doesn't know how game development works, and how changing things especially the main physics of the game works, or how that can affect things, look at this\nhttp://nextcargame.com/week-16-report/\nDoes this game still look fun to play?

It has got impressive car damage and deformation, fully functional online mode with dedicated servers, AI opponents and complete mod support. The first time you start the game, you'll start with a slow and fragile car, but you'll be able to earn money to upgrade it or buy other cars. At the moment, the game has 8 official cars available.\nThis game has potential, but getting it now or when finished is only up to you (even though I agree it is a bit overpriced for being an alpha product with not much content yet).\n\nI disagree with most of the negative reviews this game is getting.\n-"The game is a simulator and destruction is missing/the game used to be fun but now it's trash":\nthis is totally false. The destruction is there and it's cool (especially since the last update from May). The driving model, although being realistic, is not sim-y at all. Perfectly playable with keyboard. Don't have any skills or just want to smash other cars? Enable driving assists.\nOnly the driving model was drastically changed from EA launch to actual update. The pacing and smashing cars are as fun as they were, objectively speaking.\nIt's like people are still stuck in the seventh build that came out a year ago, when the new engine was still at its prime and has made things worse for the most part after months of waiting, but the game is now going on the right track.\n\n-"The game is abandoned"\nno, it isn't. The development is slow, but it's still being worked on. Funny how people and recent negative reviews keep saying that even though we're still getting updates regularly (after a looong wait because of a physics overhaul, before the seventh build). It's clear as crystal in the News section...\nThough I agree new content doesn't come out much frequently and, as with other Early Access games, there's no guarantee this game will be fully finished. Hopefully, it will.\n\nAll I can say is that you should try the game yourself. There's always the ability to refund if you don't like it or just want to try the alpha version before the final one. Worth picking up during a sale though, as it's fun to smash other cars in both SP and MP.","May 25","true","57.8"," 47 of 60 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","47","60","0","6"

It litterally feels as if one person takes a weekend a month to type in a few lines of code to keep this game updated to a bare minimum. Steam should really REALLY force to implement a system to get your money back and bankrupt studio's who pull off stunts like this. If you want to have an early access game, you are basically asking for a kickstart. Not finishing the product is basically stealing money from people who trust the studio. And when you steal my money, I want it back. Period. That or give me what I paid for, investing money in a great concept and finish a functional game. This trend where people try out game design and quit half way through is getting out of hand. Same with Cube World. One guy earns millions. Wife comlpains he should focus more on his family and he stops updating the game. Litterally nothing new has come out there as well. Paying money for tech demo's? Has the market really changed where the gamers themselves are the investors? Are we supposed to take the risk with our money to pay for, not only an unfinished product, but the chance they abandon the project as well?\n\nIf you want to pay for a really nice and original tech demo 27,99 is 27,99 too much for this title. No updates. Half a demo with barely any content or game design. Abandoning your game is a gamers crime and should not be accepted. Steam should really work on a envirionment where the gamer is put on the first place and this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ behaviour stays unrewarded. Early acces should have a function that if too many people downvote the progress of this game, they should be able to get their money back. They are stealing from us while we trust them with our money. This is legal, but really should be made impossible. I know it's our choice to pay for it, but if the developer abandons the game the buyer should have the right to abandon the developer and get their money back.\n\nDo not buy this game anymore...

From a distance it looks like just another derstrcution derby type game that we all have seen times before that is amazing, yet get bored with after just a few hours of gameplay, but being that it was from the makers of Flatout 1 and 2. I had to do some research on it and as I dug into the game a little more I found out what the plans are for the future of the game and my perspective started to change a little.\nNow with this game being in an early state. There is a limit to whats available right now. You get 2 cars to choose from right now. One being your typical American Classic Muscle car and the other being a a small European Classic. Along with that you also recieve 3 tracks to play on. One Demolition Derby style track and 2 race tracks each with 3 modes of play including a 24 player race, a 12 player race, and a practice mode. There is also something included with Early Access that is called "Next Car Game Sneak Peak 2.0" Which Is pretty much a playground for enviroment and body damage testing.  Its actually really fun to just play around in.\nAs for the physics and controls on the cars.  I was quite impressed as the destrction and just the overall feel for the cars felt quite unique and really smooth. The game features soft body damage and even environment damage that looks and acts far more realistic than any other game of this type has before. Right now the AI is a little aggressive and there is no difficulty option available at the moment so you will have to learn how to defend yourself against them. I reccommend practicing the tracks atleast once before starting a 24 player race. Multiplayer will be made available and players hosting will have options to customize the server by changing various options like private or public and allowing upgrades on vehicles or not. I can imagine a 24 player online race would be really intense in a game like this and definitley something I would want to experience.\nAlong side all that there is vehicle upgrading and modifiying as well. You are limited on what you can change right now, but there are a few options. Alot of stuff is to be added later so expect to be spending alot of time in your garage customizing and tuning the 24 vehicles that are supposed to be released with the full game. Customization will include engine upgrades, body parts, and custom paintjobs altho the main focus it on the internal workings of the car itself. You will also have to change parts between races too as the parts will take damage and become worn out.  I have also read there will be an ingame classifieds section where you will be able to buy and sell cars and their parts, but not much was said about it. Lets hope this does get included.\nOverall I'm really looking forward to the initial release of this game as I have become quite bored with the very few tracks and cars available right now. Im hoping for a patch really soon.\nI highly reccommend this game to any racing game finatics and especially anyone that is a fan of the Flatout series. I have high hopes and expectations for the game so lets hope Bug Bear really puts their all into this.\n","January 21, 2014","true","6.0"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","0"

Been hoping this game would start looking like a polished product by now. It looks like someone got in over their head with this project. Don't be fooled by the pic's on the store page, the gameplay is poor for the amount of time the dev's have had. I want to love this game... Just can't wrap my arms around it. I'm even sad that I can't recomend it. They should just re-release Flatout Ultimate Carnage - Remove GFWL and add a Multiplayer LAN option. It's a lot better than this tird. You can't polish a tird. But what do I know... I'm just a gamer. I hope the dev's prove me wrong someday... At this point (October 1 2015) , still a waste of money. I'm very disappointed with this game.\nJust deceided to re-visit this game tonight (January 18 2016) currently selling for $39.99 CDN.\nWhat's changed??? Oh ya... " Ride-On Lawnmowers". December update??? Conviently near Christmas, just as someone here predicted. Just a ploy for more sales.\nI think the developers are getting a laugh out of all us suckers.\nDon't be a sucker.","October 1, 2015","false","2.3"," 45 of 61 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","45","61","0","0"

BUGBEAR, the hook of this game was the chaotic and impressive damage and balls to the wall racing. The new realistic track is quite boring. Please go back to the crazy, wacky, intensity of before. Every step towards realism pushes me farther away from this title. It's a good game with responsive handling in one update, and then everything is stiff in the next. What handling was best...look to the playground that was released to the early backers/earlier versions of the game. This game was different, I fear it'll become the banger version of gran turismo.\n\nplease BUGBEAR, I've been along for a lot of the ride, the game is losing it's charm inside the realism. I don't know if there are loud voices in the community calling for more realism but you've had it nailed a couple times. the balance shifted towards realism again, and again. No longer are there rollovers in the opening turns, and the AI no longer tries to kill you in a regular race, cars can't be thrown around in the same fashion, and the damage modelling becomes stiffer yet again. Please take a critical look at what had everyone excited for this in the first place.\n\nI'll add that the durability, marketplace, and car purchasing is a step in the right direction. That adds to the game in a way that makes it deeper w/o taking out any of the fun.","November 21, 2015","true","27.7"," 56 of 82 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","56","82","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dave_Eagles/recommended/228380/","Dave_Eagles","Dave_Eagles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dave_Eagles/","214 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've long been a fan of racing games, and I have to say Burnout Paradise was one of my favourites, I played it to the point of obsession, up until i got that damn platinum trophy on PS3. I loved the driving, I loved the vehicle smashing, i loved the game and picking it up on PC I expected once again to have fun. However having already completed the game in full, I unfortunately no longer had the desire to do it all again.\n\nThis game has filled my Burnout Paradise void.\n\nWhether it be in the crazy races which I never seem to win (but never get frustrated with), or whether it is in those Car derbies which turn into an orgy of metal blocks running on their own fumes in the middle. The chaos in this game just fills me with the same joy Paradise did all those years ago.\n\nWhilst there's not a lot available now in the game, I expect myself to get on and race to pass the time every now and again until more and more content becomes available. The smashing of the cars is the game's greatest strength and it never, gets old. This means there is tonnes of replayability if watching wrecks fly through the air is your thing (it is most certainly mine). There is nothing more satisfying than sending an opponent into stacked tires then watching them fly through the air with those same tires following behind him before showering down on his bonnet.\n\nThe handling takes some getting used to, the extreme physicality that the other vehicles have sends your already hard to drive vehicle dancing and spinning from side to side as you try to gain control and move in a straight line. However once you do learn how to drive, you can take advantage of the sliding and turn into opponents during derbies or let them push you before you slide around at a corner in those races. Hard to master, but very rewarding.\n\nIf racing or derbies get old for you, you will definitely want to check out the 2.0 demo. The smashing vehicles into crumbling textureless buildings and blue tires is oh so satisfying. A very fun way to pass the time. It makes we wonder if challenge maps will be availabe in the future in which users must navigate their way through traps to an end point. A lot of the 2.0 demo reminds me of the flatout games, were users would need to launch their car drivers out their windows towards a target. A similiar thing will hopefully be introduced in which users must get their vehicles the longest distance with the least damage or perhaps even most damage! 2.0 has welcomed a world of possibilities to this excitingly fun game.\n\nI'm looking forward to the future Bugbear, I hope you deliver and exceed everyone's expectations with what is already a solid racer.\n\nIf car orgies and intensely chaotic races are your thing, I would most definitely pick up this title, and along with me, look forward to what's to come!","November 30, 2014","true","2.0"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","31","41","0","0"

There wasn't a lot to do and it only had 3 tracks but it was awesome. Cars were fast, the AI absolutely garbage but unbelievably fun. The game was the definition of chaos, very entertaining chaos.\n\nOver the course of the last few months we got almost no updates. I heard they had some problems with their engine but frankly I don't care. The last update was a big one, added the so called "market". Don't worry, it is not for microtransactions. But instead for parts and cars. You now start with the worst and slowest car on the planet and you earn ingame money after every race with which you can upgrade your car or buy a new one.\n\nSo far so good, it is fun to have that in singleplayer although I would love to have a "♥♥♥♥ it, let's jump into a race with the fastest cars"-mode. The problem is, that the career translates into multiplayer. That means as someone who hasn't played much I am now forced to either grind a few hours with my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car to get enough money to upgrade, or I can accept it and have NO chance of winning in multiplayer.\n\nThe game itself is great but some design choices are crap.

Either my computer is better than it appears or the game's physics coding is so damn solid it's very hard to fault.\n\nPlay the tech demo under the assumption that restrictions to the physics will be added in the future, because for now, as hilarious as it is, having your car STILL drivable with 1 wheel, no engine, and crushed into the size of a beach ball is a little far fetched, and while it is extremely satisfying to watch it get smashed and mangled into 1000 peices over and over and over in 1000 different ways, the realism is broken after a certain point because it has no killswitch as such.\n\nI am excited to see more from Next Car Game, especially different game modes, tracks, cars etc.\n\nIf you enjoy FlatOut, Crashday, GRID or Destruction Derby (the original), then I highly recommend this game, especially the Tech Demo.\n\nGraphics are solid, the destruction physics are some of the most impressive I have ever seen (and I've seeked out games like this for over 15 years).\n\nIt also has full controller support even for the very freshly added features (The cannon, added within the last couple of weeks).\n\nNOTE: You need a pretty beasty computer to enjoy this lag free. I suspect the graphics aren't nearly as taxing as the physics, so bare in mind that CPU power is a big player in this game.\n\nVery keen to see more from Bugbear.\n\nEarly Access game: 6/10 (so far, with its current content)\nTech Demo Bonus: 9/10\n\nIf Bugbear added the physics playground to the Early Access game this would be hard not to give a 10/10 to.... But alas, they have kept them seperate for unknown reasons (they seem like different build versions)\n\nI've also attempted to take the game apart and see if I could port cars from the Early Access game to the tech demo, no such luck, this game in it's current form is NOT very moddable, not in any conventional way that I'm aware of.\n\n\nAs for the cons of the game, well, it is Early Access so I'll try and be fair;\n\n- The title is a bit bland & generic, and doesn't accurately portrey the amount of effort these guys have put into coding such a detailed soft body dynamics engine.\n\n- Only 3 camera modes, which is ok, but it really needs more. Especially in a driving game. (And especially in it's current state)\n\n- There is no driver model as such, there is a driver inside the vehicle, but it is part of the soft body of the car, and thus bends and mangles with the car, funny, but realism breaking.\n\n- The sound design of the car engine is pretty awesome, however, there is only really 1 or 2 variants so far. Gets annoying after a couple of hours\n\n- In the Tech Demo, the edge of the map contains a yellow boundary that repairs and resets your car after driving on it, however, if you miss it (fly over it and off the edge into the void) your car just resets, sometimes nowhere near where you flew off the map. I think this is minor but it too gets annoying having to pause and press Repair All (and lose all the destruction around the map) just to be able to continue driving\n\n- The Early Access game doesn't really have much in the way of instructions or helpers. You and 23 (max) other AI players in a small demo derby arena, obviously trying to be the last surviving, but the problem is no mini map, no hint of WHO is remaining, apart from the # of players left top right of the screen. Few times I've not been able to get to the 1 person left, because their car is still 'alive' but not drivable, ergo they are stuck in the middle of 22 other cars that I also can't get to. There shouldn't be an option for stalemate in demo derby but that's the outcome i've had many times.","June 5, 2014","true","0.7"," 32 of 44 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","32","44","0","0"

It bears not a small resemblance to it's preceding series Flatout, which isn't surprising considering it's made by the same development team. That said I can see this shaping up to be the pinacle of their work so far, and it's still Pre-Alpha!\n\nIt features some of the best destruction available in motor racing games today. Most games that feature "real" cars are restricted by contracts with the manufactures as to exactly how much they can be damaged. Wreckfest, by contrast, gives you jaw-drapping impacts and the resulting destruction cripples everyone visually and functionally. Granted the cars are not specific to a real world counterpart, but you wouldn't know that to look at them. They are authentic-looking amalgamations of classic car styles and seem familiar by design if not by make and model.\n\nFinally a Destruction Derby style racing game with modern physics and infinite replayability for those of us who love the genre. The game is beautiful, technically challenging, and most importantly, fun. Hilarious laugh-out-loud fun.\n\nI can't wait to try the multiplayer with Teamspeak and a large group of friends. Because I can't think of anyone I'd rather crush into little tiny pieces.","November 17, 2014","true","57.2"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","26","35","0","0"

For a game in alpha, it's certainly quite impressive. We used to pay around £30 for PS1 games in the old days of fat square tellys. We had those real pounds they used to have, made of real paper money, not those invisible electronic pounds they have now. Kids today, with their fancy eye-pads and interweb don't know the hard times we had back then. We had to tend to our sheeps, make soup from hedgehogs and cowpats, served in wellington boots, then rent the latest betamax tape, or go to the posh kid's house to beg for  a go on his Intellivision and Atari consoles, made of real wood. Not like that electronic wood they have now. We had to dance for a game of Outlaw, or the worst game in the world - E.T. - The Extremely Terrible from Activision. A game made in about 2 weeks by a man now filled with remorse and bitter disappointment at what could have been. It's unknown how many holes E.T. fell down, but ironically the unsold E.T. cartridges wer dumped into a large hole in the New Mexico desert.

This is still an early build, but already impressive. The car damage model is probably the best I've seen in a game. The graphics also look outstanding, though the game requires a powerfull PC to max things out. Car handling is somewhere between realism and arcade though driving aids are avaialble and even with these on, the cars act in a plausible manner. That said, this is not something you would play with a wheel.

This is an alpha build, and while a lot of elements are in place, the content is limited to a few cars and tracks, no career mode, just single races / destruction derbys.

The amount they are charging for it is outrageous... it's not even worth the price at %50 off.  They have an almost non existant online community, regardless of what the few people in the forums tell you.  They won't even show you how many are online because it's so low.  The community is toxic and can't take critisism at all.  You say anything negative about this game and you're branded a troll...  It could have been a fun game, but they took it in a direction opposite of what they advertised.  The racing is not even close to real, physics wise and it's player run servers so you can get banned out of a room for nothing.  And with no one else playing leaves you to sit there and twiddle your thumbs.  It's become a warning for anyone wanting to try "Early Access"...... Early Access, that should have a time limit on it... The game has been early access for years now, it should have at least made it into Beta.... But with Devs that don't communicate with the forums, except for the elite of fanboys, you can't expect to get a very well done game....... Try it if you like, but you'd be better off just setting your money on fire....\n\nUpdate... it's now May 2016... yup, still terrible and the same handful of white knights pushing more players away...

The game stopped with Destruction Derby 2 on the PS1, and I had always wondered when there was going to be a Destruction Derby 3?  My wait is finally over.  Destruction Derby 3 is what "Next Car Game: Wreckfest" should be called.  It's like literally picking up from where you left off.  Only it's in early stage and there are no points to gain for spinning an opponent 90 degrees or 180, etc... I'm running with Radeon 6670HD and a couple of the settings on high and the game runs smoothly.  On a good race you can reach speeds of +90mph!  Looks good as well.  The debries from cars, like bumpers n fenders, tires and other broken stuff stay on and litter the track the entire race!  Walls break apart when the cars crash into them!  The damage your car can take is awesome lol.  I love it.

But this doesn't stop from having fun as it is.\n\nThe game's handling and damage model keeps getting better and more realistic with the lastest updates, which I think is a good thing. As it is now, it's demolition derby / banger racing with a large dose of realism both in handling and crashes.\n\nIf you want big explosions and loads of huge crashes, this isn't the game for you. I guess that is left for the Flatout series.\nThis is a more realistic banger racing / demolition derby game and that's what I was missing for a long time, in my gaming collection!","December 6, 2015","true","28.5"," 32 of 51 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","32","51","3","1"

Graphically, this game is beautiful and the Engine it runs on wants to run it that way too. Never once did I feel that this game even looked sub-par. The Tech-Demo that you get  when you pre-order it is alone worth $25. I could play, just that Tech-Demo, for years. But, ofcourse, you also get the PRE-Alpha. Keep in mind that it's PRE, and it's already better than most finished products i've played. The destruction mechanic blew my mind. It is definetly the best destruction Engine i've ever seen. Just the way the debris mesh together, or get blow sky high, made me feel powerful. For instance, instead of driving around in a car, you can press C twice (In the Tech-Demo) to leave the car and fly around, destroying things as some flying demon.

Maybe I am the black sheep but I really enjoy the game with its tendency to simulation. I can agree with reviews saying the game is less spectacular and arcade-feeling, but steering is more accurate (with a gamepad and a Logitech Driving Force GT tested by myself) and races are more exciting in my point of view. I really wish developers will add more track really soon and with more time a career mode and a local split-screen mode (up to 4 players).

I like racing games, and I love destruction and physics, but as a total package this game is severely lacking.\n\nThe fun factor is limited.  The tracks are boring.  The driving itself isn't very good. The crashing is excellent, but overall it leaves you unsatisfied.\n\nAfter owning this game since it launched on early access there have been VERY little improvements.  Just another game thrown up on early access for quick cash, while there's probably one developer who tinkers with it on the weekends when he's got nothing else to do.\n\nI would pass as there's really nothing here.  If it was say $1, then fine, but I paid $25 for this title and even when it is done, it will never be worth the price paid, as I'll never get $25 worth of fun out of it.","January 19, 2015","false","1.9"," 50 of 89 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","50","89","2","3"

If the game's this good in it's current state it has an enormous potential to be the finest racing game on the market on release.\n\nControls are a bit loose and crashes occur but it doesn't take away from the experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zycorax/recommended/228380/","zycorax","Zycorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zycorax/","408 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWreckfest has the potential to become one of the greatest racing games ever in my opinion. The game is made by the same guys that made the Flatout series (excluding Flatout 3) and it's more or less a spiritual successor of these games, so if you liked Flatout, chances are that you'll love Wreckfest.\n\n-Performance-\nThe game looks really good on high graphics settings and runs smoothly most of the time (the only FPS drop I've had was when a car with a smoking engine drove right in front of the camera at some point). I've only had it crash once in the 7.5 hours I've played and it was just while trying to start a single player race.\n\n-Driving-\nThe driving fits in somewhere in the middle between arcade and sim racing, maybe leaning a bit more towards sim. I've been using a 360 controller when I've been playing and it's been working really well for me. I've found that I often have to correct the steering a little while turning, something I would imagine is a lot harder to do successfully with a keyboard (although I haven't tried), so a controller of some kind is probably recommended.\n\n-Crashing-\nAs the name suggests, one of the main elements in this game is crashing. I think all of the bodywork of the car can be destroyed and it probably will after you've rolled over five times after getting t-boned by a competitor that didn't bother trying to avoid your car while you were recovering from that spin. The visual destruction looks good, though maybe a bit over the top. You start wondering how you can still drive when your car is suddenly a metre shorter than it was when you started the race. Your car can take quite a lot of punishment before breaking down. In some cases you can actually keep racing (albeit not very well) even if you're missing a wheel.\nSome of the tracks also features some small, steep hills along the tracks, which works really well as ramps. It's always amusing to watch the AI drivers in front of you fail to take the turn properly and launch themselves into the air before suffering the consequences of a not very clean landing. Until you arrive at the same corner and understeers terribly or receives a shunt from the guy behind you and suffer the same fate.\nCars that breaks down stays on the race track until the race is over, adding extra obstacles to the track. In longer races you'll often see piles of cars in some places.\n\n-Cars-\nRight now there's only five cars to choose from. Each of them comes with five liveries and some performance customisation. Hopefully there will be a lot more to choose from when the game is finished. On the bright side, the current cars feels quite different to each other, at least the ones I've tried do. The American muscle cars (there's two of them) are fast and heavy, but seems to be struggling a bit in sharp turns, while the little European coupe is both fast and handles really well, it gets pushed around easily.\n\n-Tracks-\nThere's currently nine different tracks, something I also hope will be expanded in the future. Out of these three of them are demolition derby arenas, which I'm personally not really a fan of. The six others are more or less proper race circuits. There's three basic tracks in different environments with different surfaces, one tarmac, one gravel and one sandpit (my personal favourite. All of these three also come with a reverse layout, which actually feels quite different from the normal version.\nThere's also an oval track, which has an alternate figure-8 version and a pure figure-8 track.\nThe last one is a work-in-progress sandpit circuit that comes in two slightly different layouts (plus their reverse layout). These works perfectly well, if you don't mind the missing ground textures off the track.\n\n-Singleplayer-\nThe only game mode at the moment is single races. All of the tracks works with up to 23 AIs with an upper limit of ten laps. The AI isn't very fast over one lap, so if you take an early lead you can expect a rather uneventful race, unless you do any major mistakes. However, if you get bogged down at the start and find yourself in the middle of the pack, you're in for a challenge. The AI likes to get in your way, so while you're fighting your way through the field, the leader will often be next to impossible to catch.\nSingle races against the AI is only fun for so long, so some sort of career mode would probably dot he game good.\n\n-Multiplayer-\nI haven't played multiplayer a lot yet, but I've certainly enjoyed it. A multiplayer game has to be hosted by the players, ideally by someone who has a good internet connection (8 Mbps upload is recommended according to the Create Game window in game). Multiplayer supports up to 24 players and I have to say, the more the merrier. Having 24 cars on the oval track (which appears to be the most popular online by far) is guaranteed to be a mess. There seems to usually be at least one or two who just tries their best to crash into people to ruin their race, but they're nowhere near as annoying as they were on GRID, mostly because the cars in Wreckfest are a lot more durable. I've had some good racing online, including a battle with another guy that lasted for nearly three laps and at some point I also got two takedowns in a race, despite trying my best to avoid any collissions.\n\n-Conclusion-\nThe game itself is great and I recommend trying it out if you like games like Flatout or the demolition derby races in GRID. Just keep in mind that the game isn't finished yet and because of that it feels a little light on content.","November 3, 2014","true","48.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I'll add a TL:DR down there. This review will most likely change to a thumbs up in the future.\n\nAt this time, I cannot recommend this game. Pretty much just for one very obvious reason. At only half hour played, it isn't a fair time period to propely demo the game, but time isn't a factor for the reason I can't endorse this right now. Read on, or skip to the end.\n+ Graphics: Very pretty. The entire visual portion of this game is great. The cars, the effects, the debris flying off, the lighting... pretyy much all of it. Excellent job.\n\n+/- Sounds: For the most part the sounds are well done. The engines sound good, the collisions have goot impacts... On the down side, the engine sounds get monotonous. The constat revving, and the poor localization of sound makes it sound like someone is constantly right behind you.\n\n+ Gameplay Options: With the standard demolition derby and destruction races, there really isn't much else to want for. It's a great modern adaptaion of the Destruction Derby games for PSOne\n\n+/- Physics: Almost entirely positive here. It a game based upon the physics of objects colliding. It does this very well on almost every area. There was only one thing that struck me as out of place while I was playing >  I saw an AI car get some unrealistic height out of a jump(sand pile), and then proceed to change direction in the air. It was a small thing I guess, and I'm not holding it against the game.\n\n- Controls: This is the reason I can't sign off on this game right now. Only control option at the moment(incomplete game, this will most certianly be addressed) is keyboard. Meaning DIGITAL controls. It's a racing/driving game which requires an amount of finesse that can be frustrating with only digital controls as an option. Not everyone has access to a steering wheel set up for their PC, but everyone has some other analog devices at their disposal. Most people have a controler with thumbsticks for analog input and triggers for analog throttle. EVERYONE has a mouse, or some form of trackpad input. Euro Trucker 2 has made this work as an option for people who don't have a wheel.\nTL:DR - Keep your eye on this one. It's a good game, and fun in it's current state. The deciding reason for a thumbs down are the controls. I'm certain this will change, and my review will aslo change at that time. I'm stopping at under 2 hours of play time in the hope that it goes on a better sale before the event end. Either way, I may just return it and wait for more changes to take place. It is an 'early access', and it's nice that we finally have a risk free way of trying things. I DO like this game and will most likely just hold onto it until it becomes more complete.\n\nP.S. Seriously Valve, WTF?! This binary yay/nay, good/bad, black/white, review system has to go. Give some sort of rating system to more accurately reflect someone opinion of the game. This shouldn't be a thumbs down. It should be a 6/10, or something.","June 12, 2015","false","0.5"," 60 of 109 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","60","109","2","5"

The damage is unparralled by any other racing game Ive played thus far. Drive with four wheels, 3 wheels and yes, 2 wheels. Demolition is great with deathmatch modes for respawning carnage and more. The racing is good as well with ovals, figure 8's , as well as on and off road circuit courses. There is no way to not laugh while playing. Especially now that there is full 24 player online action. The carnage is epic. For now we have to  rely on the lobby chat and sometimes teamspeak to commuicate but we are hoping for in game voip for the ultimate experience as well as more host capabilities to change options without having to exit the lobby.  Its not perfect but its worth it. I always find myself wanting to come back for more car-carnage.

I do, and I freaking loved it. Sadly that game would be absolutely unbearable nowadays. Thats where Wreckfest comes in.\n\nThe great thing about Wreckfest is that it isnt just Derby. There are circuit tracks on tarmac, and gravel. You have a small variety of cars to choose from and with recent updates there is a progression system so you can finally start from the bottom and work your way up.\n\nNow, Wreckfest wasn't always as good, and wasn't always recieving updates as frequently as it is now. The good folks developing this gem have spent some time ironing out their version of car physics so that racing can be exciting and enjoyable for all car classes. The damage modeling they have done is great and its extremely satisfying to see your car get wrecked up during semi-clean contact racing.\n\nThis game has come a long way and the developers truly appear committed to completing this game and having it stand on its own in a sea of racing sims. A racing sim you will not find here. This is an arcade style simulation with the flavour of real physics behind it. You can enjoy it with wheel, a controller, or even a keyboard and you will not feel at a disadvantage which to me is extremely important. Although with a wheel you could probably have a great deal of fun drifting through corners in their new Asian Drifter style car(kind of looks like an old skyline).\n\nThe absolutely best part of this game though has got to be its Multiplayer. This game is like the DayZ of racing games when you are online, its just awesome. Most of the players that stick with this game prefer a Semi-Clean racing style, so you will enjoy the bump and grind of a derby, but against the backdrop of a circuit race. Its incredible how much fun you can have when you get a server full of people to race so clean no one is intentionally hitting, but everyone is trying to get in front and you have cars going 3 wide through corners without wrecking, but instead shoving and pushing each other out of the way as they jostle for that lead position.\n\n...And then. You might join a server with no rules at all, and you'll be wiping the tears from your eyes because for the first time ever you're in first place, and then crunch! Both your front wheels are gone, your engine is bent in half and there is a smoldering wreck of a car from a player going backwards on the track, probably giggling and laughing hysterically in front of their screens as they watch 4 or 5 more cars plow into you, turning your car into a smoldering wreck aswell.\n\nTo each their own to be sure, but man the multiplayer can be wicked fun. I hope they make it so you can play the entire game progression wise on multiplayer. Right now you simply get all the cars for free but dont earn anything, and if you choose to race with a car you do own, you don't really earn enough for it to be worth while.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading, this game is an easy 8/10 as it is, because it really is that fun. I will climb to a solid 9/10 by the time all the content is in and they leave early access.","May 6","true","55.0"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","24","41","0","0"

I fell in love with it.  Ordered it from overseas before it was retailed here in the states.\n\n12 years later now, I still love so much about the series.  And NCG:Wreckfest was an obvious winner with its tremendous physics and collision engines.  It promised to be a monster of a fun game.\n\nYet 17 months after it was dropped here, its still barely a functioning game.  It works, but it feels like its been abandoned by Bugbear.  This is precisly what devolepers should NOT do when releasing a game into an Early Access enviroment.  Some of us here understand that we are paying to beta test a game for a discount on the final product.  But if we are being beta testers, it  has to have a lot of dialog and feedback from the dev team.  Not relasing a single update in 7 months is going to be a death sentence.\n\nWill it be good if/when its done?  Hell yes, and I will probebly recommend you buy it.  But right now?  Nope.  Wait untill its done.\n\n7/27/15 Update!\nAnd now it wont run with my car on the ground!  As long as Im in the air, I get moderate frame rate.  If my car is on the ground... mabey 3 fps.

The game also runs very bad on mid-level machines, like 20-40 frames maximum with 12 Ai cars, even on low resolutions with everything turned off.\nThis feels very much like incompetent programming.\n\nDo not believe these videos and screenshots, as they are souped-up fakeshots and do not represent your actual game experience. I guess you already know the drill. Multiplayer is as good as dead, and the singleplayer AI drivers are super-boring on-rails.\nThe tracks also suck.

It's also worth mentioning that each of the current tracks can be played in reverse to help keep things fresh.\n\nWhilst upgradable car parts, career mode and true online play are yet to be implemented you can still play with your friends locally over a LAN.\nThere are also several skins available for each vehicle (red cars go faster right?) so you can scratch up the paint job of your choice when you take the car out for a spin!\n\n\nYou Spin Me Right Round Baby, Right Round\n\nSo you've picked your car, chosen your track and now you're sitting in your old patched up jalopy admiring the rust showing through your go faster stripes.\nThe countdown hits zero, you hit the gas and away you go!\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is how good everything already looks, as you're noticing this you'll inevitably be experiencing your first crash which gives you the opportunity to admire how good the damage looks too.\nTearing around the track, you start to encounter an increasing number of debris strewn across your path, be it parts torn from your competition or unfortunate pieces of the scenery which failed to survive their encounter with whatever chunk of high speed rust and metal had smashed into them.\n\n\nTwisted Metal\n\nBy lap 2 or 3 the track will be littered with an impressive amount of twisted metal and if your driving skills are anything like mine, you'll now be racing a smoking, unrecognisably crushed shell of car desperately trying to gain one more place by taking out the equally damaged vehicle in front.\n\nThis is a huge amount of fun, and whilst the handling still needs as much fine tuning as my own racing abilities, the experience itself is a blast.\nYou can also try your hand at the pure carnage of a destruction derby. All pretence at racing is gone in this mode, just obliterate your opponents and be the last car standing. This option is great for blowing off steam, but for me, it's the track racing that's the jewel in NCG's crown.\n\n\nBaby Steps\n\nAt the moment playing NCG is like watching a child take its first steps, it might be a little wobbly, sometimes it falls down, but it still fills you with a sense of awe, there's so much potential here.\nSure, where it's at now is fun, there's plenty of entertainment to be found, but you know it's going to grow into something so much more.\nSupport the games development now or wait until release, it's up to you, but this is definitely a title to keep an eye on.\n\nFor the full review and others please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/review-well-home.html","September 10, 2014","true","2.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

These guys at Bugbear really know what they're doing.\n\nI'm 9.5 hours in, playing with an Xbox360 controller, and let me tell you: I haven't had this fun with a racer since Colin McRae 04!\n\nAnd it's still in alpha. For me it was totally worth the purchase in its current state. So much so that I decided to put down cash on a racing wheel, for the first time ever, just to play this game.\n\nThere are no stupid achievements to get, no street-cred ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and no ♥♥♥♥ing dlcs yet. Next Car Game is pure racing as it should've always been. Just choose a car, select the engine, drivetrain, transmission, suspension and color; pick a track, and race.\n\nThat's all a racing game really needs when IT IS GOOD enough to stand on it's own.\n\nBonus: When you boot up the game, don't expect to wait for 1 unskippable minute while 12 different ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ logos show up before you can actually play what you actually paid for. It's just bugbear's logo, and it's quick.\n\nLet's hope Bugbear keeps it like that. They have a real winner in their hands.\n\nI'm playing with a GeForce GTX550TI on a 1080p screen.

Not a finished product.\nThis game is Pre-Alpha. Not beta. Not alpha. Pre-Alpha.\nWhat that means is that some updates will be a step forward in some areas and a step back in others.\nThat means that this game is very sparse on content and polish.\nThat means that, for now, updates are going to be infrequent because they're mostly working on the game engine and physics engine and things like that. Frequent updates at this point would just mean buggy, glitchy updates. Once Pre-Alpha is over and the game moves into Alpha, then content updates (new cars, tracks, etc) will become more frequent.\n\nThis is Bugbear, who brought us some of my favorite racing games of all time. The game is already very fun with an already very functional multiplayer. It's still miles off of resembling its finished state, but I have faith that, in a year or so, this game is going to be spectacular, if given the proper time and funding. Which is why I purchased this game so early in development.\n\nThe only reason to purchase this right now is to support the development of this game. Buying this game and then criticizing it or refunding it for being incomplete is completely against the idea of Early Access and just hurts this game's chances of ever becoming something amazing.","July 8, 2015","true","42.9"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","19","32","0","0"

However, the car controls, the multiplayer netcode and synchronousity, the lack of most planned features, low amount of race tracks and cars, lack of good single player (career mode / improved AI) make me not recommend it YET. I recommend to wait for way more patches before buying it. So far it is only really good fun for 1-2 hours, unless you are really in love with damage models and crash derbies. In multiplayer there are too many issues at the moment to make it really enjoyable (lag spikes, bad net code, sync, people driving in the opposite direction to troll, ...)\n\nWhat bothers me regarding the Early Access part is that the updates seem to be coming really slowly and rarely and that the developers do not communicate well enough about what they are doing despite this. The info comes sparsely (less than once per month) blog entries. From a community-funded game I would expect weekly updates on what they are doing, otherwise we have to assume they might be just taking extra holidays on our costs all the time, when there is no new information for months.\n\nSo far: DO NOT BUY\n\nEDIT #1: There has been an update to the game after 9 (?) months of nothingness and awful communication. It seems to make the vehicles more heavy and rigid, feels like driving a tank, difficult to accelerate and oversteering when doing turns. Generally this update made the car handle more difficult and quite unintuitive. Another (mostly visual) complaint is that, unlike before, crashes now show almost 0 effect (wtf?) even though you might slam into the side of the other car at high speeds and your screen shakes. Overall I feel like the changes are mostly towards the negative, there is still a chance they will improve this, but I dont have the "right direction" feeling anymore on this game.\n\nEDIT #2: More updates came, handling still by far not as challenging and fun as in Flatout 2, atm I wouldnt buy. Lets await further developments...\n\nEDIT #3: There hasn't been a single update in months. We are back to nothingness. Also they seem to have dropped all the arcade elements and modes that made Flatout 2 so fun. There aren't even jumps or alternative routes and shortcuts in the maps anymore. I do not have a positive lookout on this anymore, and the physics trailer and EA demo promised an entirely different picture than the game we now get. I was never willing to support a serous game that requires a wheel in order to drive well enough to compete... This is what this game has become.\n\nEDIT #4: They jacked up the price just before the Black Friday sales to give a bigger discount. This is not just unethical but also illegal (somewhere, maybe).","December 28, 2014","false","11.3"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","20","34","0","2"

It manages to have the worst combination of elements from a sim racer and an arcade racer, resulting in a game that does neither element well.  All of the vehicles handle as though none of the developers have driven a car in real life; cars seems to always exhibit copious amounts of understeer or spin wildly out of control the instant you have the audacity to touch the brake.  My pickup truck handles better than these “things” that the game lets you control – I hesitate to call them cars.\n\nTechnically, the game is a pure fright.  My aging, but still by no means humble, gaming laptop was largely unable to run this game with the graphical configurations above the lowest possible setting, resulting in a game that actually manages to look and run worse than the original FlatOut.  Let that sink in for a minute – a ten year old game manages to look prettier and run better than a game made in 2015!  After cutting the in-game resolution in half and disabling as many graphical options as possible, I finally had what looked like a worthy contender for Best N64 Game of 1998.\n\nThe damage modeling is a joke.  Parts fly off cars and the frames bend up to a certain degree, but at the end of the day, the cars handle like rigid bodies and have a damage model to match.  If you want spectacular crashes, go play BeamNG.Drive.  The cars handle like actual cars – and that’s considering BeamNG’s fairly simcadey car handling to begin with – the game isn’t utterly impossible to run, and the damage modeling makes an utter mockery of Next Car Game.  Avoid this game.\n\nAs a final insult, it turns out purchasing this game through the developer’s website was the worst idea I’ve had in a long time.  It turns out that Valve will not refund games purchased outside their store, even though the game can only be run using Steam.  There’s no DRM free version, no alternate digital portal that the game could have been purchased through; even though the game is a Steam exclusive, I’ve essentially been soaked for fifty dollars.  Needless to say, it’ll be a while before I throw extra money at a developer – especially Bugbear.","June 25, 2015","false","34.2"," 22 of 38 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","22","38","0","2"

Yet, that's all it is so far, potential.  Without any update potential does not mean anything other than an incomplete game.  At its current state the game it is overpriced and not worth the buy.  It is fun for a little while, and you can play with your friends, but the lack of content or progression makes you get bored eventually.\n\nIf there were to be a big update that gave this game more content I would happily change my review.

There is also quite a unique (and sometimes hilarious) damage system, with high levels of deformation meaning by the end of a tough race, you may just be driving a twisted lump of metal with two wheels.\nEven if you aren't a racing game fan, and just like to smash stuff up, Next Car Game is sure to put at least one big smile on your face.","October 28, 2014","true","10.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Look no further!  Next Car Game is the car game of the year (my opinion)!  Using a type of soft-body physics for intense crunchability, Next Car Game (NCG) is a great blend of simulator and arcade racing!  Do demolition derbies, race on dirt tracks, and don't forget the imensely satisfying destruction!\n\nThis game is created by Bugbear who made FlatOut 1 & 2.  Featuring Bugbear's vision of the ultimate banger type racing game engine, this game has huge potential!  I HIGHLY recomend you pre-order from Bugbear's website to get the game & Steam code, vs. buying the game through Steam, as you get more awesomness with it!\n\nRemember this game is Pre-Alpha, and will have different bugs with it.  If you need help, or want you opinion for where this game is going, visit Bugbear's forums, NOT THE STEAM FORUMS.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dogboydan/recommended/228380/","Dogboydan","Optipissed Prime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dogboydan/","246 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is the Flatout game I've been waiting for since the first Flatout, my favourite racing game of all time. This game is all about semi-realistic driving physics and down and dirty racing/demolition. This is by no means an easy racing game. From what I read of the negative reviews, most people were expecting a successor to the arcade style Flatout games (Flatout 2 and Flatout: Ultimate Carnage). Do not buy this game if you want to win every race by default, take corners at 300 km/h, or even finish the race. Each car (so far and I expect in the full release, as in the first Flatout) has it's own driving characteristics that takes time to master and I recommend a gamepad or wheel for proper gas control. To quote the top negative review "Why even have races in this game when you have no control over the car what so ever?" This person has obviously never driven a 300/500 horsepower muscle car and is using a keyboard. If all you hit is full gas you're just gonna do circles. This difficulty leads to a deep appreciation for how much work has already gone into the destruction of both the cars and environments. The 24 car starts are beautiful as everyone jockies for position, often leading to spectacular end over end crashes that require quick reactions to avoid, lest you be caught up in it. When you mess up a corner or are shoved off track by a rival racer and smash into the cement barriers for the first time you're amazed at how the wall realisticly crumbles. And that's just one of the many items to crash into and destroy on your way to learning how to survive and then eventually win. I can't wait to see where this game goes and would already recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the first Flatout or enjoys a satisfying, beautiful and challenging racing game.\n\nTL;DR: BUY if you like Flatout 1, destruction, challenge and semi-realistic physics. DO NOT BUY if you want a fast, arcade style, easy racer or a successor to Flatout 2 or Flatout Ultimate Carnage.","January 17, 2014","true","4.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This review will not be about every bad detail in this game, it's in beta. I mean, seriously, those people who write those reviews are idiots. Anyway, here ya go:\n\nGraphics\n\nI play this on my laptop with 2GB GT 650m and with eyecandy effects turned off and texture quality all the way up + cube map quality all the way up, the game runs with 60fps and a few rare frame drops (from large car crashes with dirt anim + objects flying, perfectly good reason for it to act like that) makes this game looking really good and extremely playable on somewhat decent machines. I expect the graphics to get even better as this game develops, just as any other game would.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are some faults to the gameplay, but overall the game is amazing for a beta stage. In the demolition derby (which currently at the time of writing this review there is only one map for demo derbies) there is wall ramps (around the edge of the map you can drive up and go down it, if you played the game, you'd get what I mean) and one plateau-type ramp. Then there's your typical cement bariers around, and tires. But what strikes me is how the AI choose to make it a demolition derby. At first when there's quite a few cars in you'll see lots of crashes, which is expected, but they ram with the front of the vehichle, regardless of whether the engine is in the front or the back.. Then as the number of cars left decreases, the AI begin to use the back of their vehichle, again regardless of engine location. This I see as unfair because not only is there no camera panning feature present but there is not even a rear vew camera. Despite this, demolition derbies are pretty good.\n\nIn races, I actually find them quite hilarious/comedic in the beginning (and really any other time that cars do the crazy stuff I'm about to explain) when cars try to drive into each other instead of taking the lead, causing cars to go flying up into the air when you go around corners (In a realistic way, not like a glitch sending it so far it looks like a little dot on your screen) and then them landing and hitting the car that it to begin with and sending that one flying. One main issue I find is that the infamous drifting in this game is a failure (at least for me, I could be just a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and not know how to drift properly) Whenever I try to drift around a corner, I end up flying in to the wall or barrier at the corner, OR if I slow down a bit before the corner and then try to drift I end up completely stopping OR if I try to continue to hold down the gas while drifting I end up getting stopped completely as well. There's no possible way to drift like the AI from what I can tell. Also, you can't really seem to turn your steering wheel too far. So you can't corner that well... Despite the things I said, the races are pretty fun and look like they give the game some great opportunities.\n\nConcept\n\nThe idea of this game is nice, having demolition derbies as its main spotlight as well as the races. Being able to customize your car already with paint jobs, different tires (standard, tarmac, gravel, etc), engine, etc there is so much to do. Not to mention that it looks like there is planned shops in the game where you can buy/repair your vehichle after races. I personally have not played any of the FlatOut games, but this game looks to have a great start and many opportunities. I suggest you buy it, and join in on the fun.","February 15, 2014","true","3.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

And, greater yet, is it worth your time playing? R: Absolutly\n\nSo, Demolition Racing games haven't been a great bet since the 90s; they have tried with Test Drivre: Eve of destruction and Dirty: showdown, but then wreckfest made me witness things within the game that I haven't seen so far in any car derby game I have ever played. The graphics are amusing, trying to be as realistic as possible and the physics of the game is something new, revolutionary I would say since the game is not being made by no great company, FlatOut is good... but you know...\n\nYou can put up to 23 cars racing simultaneously, what takes the carnage to the next level. The UI is good, nothing bad that I have noticed or disturbed my games so far.\n\nAlso I think Steam should learn something here with this game; Since the "Early access" thing I have seen some really Shi* games being released, I think All games and game developers should do an Early access with the quality and well polished job that Wreckfest Already has.\n\nI have nothing to say against this game, BUT the dirty trick, low blow so-called "Digital deluxe version" that gives you an exclusive car or something; Do I recommend you to buy this game?! the answer is yes, BUT!!! ONLY the normal version, I believe the developers have forgotten what is the meaning of EARLY ACCESS selling; This is not a Sale this is a BET on something you have no Idia of the final product or even if the final product will be delivered, early access buyers are the ultimate supporters, we should be treated as kings with all the best.\n\nHope this was useful ^^ Thanks.\n-Rony","October 31, 2014","true","2.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

So far the game seems to put more emphasis on the destruction and chaos than the racing.  Most of the physics are well done, and the damage to the cars can be hilarious.\n\nThe car and collision physics in the game are superb; however, the cars like to land on their "feet" a little too much.  The game truly shines in the demolition derbies.  The racing is fun, but better racing sims are already on the market.  This game deliver break-neck crashes in large scale form when playing in the demolition modes.  Dropping twenty four cars into a small mud arena is madness!  Watching the bits and pieces flying off the cars as they smash into each-other and the player is too fun.\n\nThe game seems to work well with a mouse and key board, but I'm sure that a game-pad would be a better option.\n\nThere really isn't all that much to say.  If you have ever wanted to play bumper cars with real cars, this game is perfect!  Unfortunately, there is no multiplayer yet, but the game is still loads of fun against the bots.  If this looks like something that you could  sink your teeth into, I recommend picking it up before it reaches it's full price.

Update that had only one feature. New physics engine! Sounds fun! FALSE. They just single handedly ruined the entire game. Racing was now slow, cars almost indestructable, crashes boring, since nothing really happened, just bending some steel plates. But, you know, it's early access, so it's to be expected, game is developing infront of us, so some mistakes can be made. So I waited again.\n\nNow, another update came out! Again taking months to release. Was the physics updated? Is it fun to race again? Nope. Almost nothing changed, race pace is slow, minimal number of crashes occur, you almost feel like driving on highway.\n\nConclusion, developers probably thinks that current physics version is correct and the best solution, since it's in same state for months now.

Whilst content is a tiny bit thin on the ground, with the amount of cars and parts available at present, there is so much promise to this game already.\n\nGraphics are really rather good, a solid physics engine (sans a couple of bugs and glitches every now and then) and great sound.\n\nBut what really sets it apart, is the gameplay, which is so much fun it is crazy. Multiplayer on this game is one of the best experiences you can have online at the moment. That is something quite major, what with the amount of sim racers, it is refreshing to have something which is good, slightly silly fun.\n\nExtremely excited for the full release, this game is promising to be really quite special.","February 1, 2015","true","66.6"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","21","37","2","1"

You can race, or crash other people to death. It's up to you, what to do.\n\nPros:    Many Game Modes | You have plenty of game modes to enjoy, including Last Man Standing, Deathmatch, Elimination Race and others. More will come, in case you will get bored of them somehow.\nOnline Multiplayer | There are online servers you can find and play with your friends, if you so desire.\nDifferent Vehicles | At the moment, there are seven cars in this game. They are not too different from one another, but it's gonna get a lot more diverse.\nMultiple Maps | Maps are already great in my opinion, you get to race in small laps, in an arena, on a dusty road and many more.\nEngine Capabilities | Collisions and their results look astonishingly good. Also, you don't just look crashed, driving the car is also influenced by that. Feels great, until you destroy your car so much that you can't even move!\nDriving Experience | Driving is smooth and very enjoyable, it feels pretty real. I can say that this is one of the most optimised parts of the game.\nCons:    Updating the Game | If you take a quick glance at the Discussions section of NCG:W's Community, you will soon notice that this game is updated way too slowly. I mean, although the content is good and plenty, this game lacks of some crucial things. Cars have upgrade menus, but few or nothing in them for choosing. It makes the game feel hollow more than it actually is. It's kinda sad, actually.\nSome Options | For event weather, you get to choose between "Random" and "Clear weather". And this is not the only example. I know this is EA, but they could at least remove Random until they add more weather conditions.\nSteam and OS Support | This is another thing that this game fails at. There are no achievements or trading cards and you can only play it on Windows.\nThe final verdict:Although the negative sides are pretty bad, I had a lot of fun playing this and, if the rumours are correct, there will be a big update out pretty soon. The crashing is super fun and it is interesting to observe all of the effects on your car. Play it with your friends and you will have some good laughs!\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

When I bought this game, I realised that it wasn't any fun. I wasn't having fun and wasted £22 on this piece of garbage. Unfortunately I'll always have this junk in my library and won't be able to sell it. Great.\n\nAfter some researching, I realised that BugBear have done nothing to improve this game at all. With their recent decisions, they have shown that they truly cannot be bothered and have handed it over to modders to take this game and attempt to make it fun as the developers are too inept and flat out lazy! I can speculate that over 90% of the mods are going to be cheap and poorly made, similar to this game but the developers had the GREAT idea to put the price tag up and keep the money rolling into their pockets.\n\nTo round up, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. YOU WILL, AND I REPEAT, WILL DESPISE IT.

The game has been in pre-alpha for a year and a half, and no new content has been added. The obstacle course is great, for about 5 minutes but after that it is just boring. The actual game is ok, but doesn't really differ from map to map. I also had no clue how to speed up faster than the other racers. and my final problem is the hardcore lag. For this game, even offline, you need a computer that has a great graphics processor for the game to run smoothly. My computer isn't directly made for gaming, but does have ok specs. Overall, I would say only buy this game if it is on sale, or when it is out of pre-alpha.","August 31, 2015","false","1.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

I'm glad  they did.  It's not yet  quite  Flatout  or Flatout 2 or Ultimate Carnage (I love all three games); though  I was really disappointed with Flatout 3, then discovered it was a different team who created that game.  Thankfully the original team have been developing this game for a few years now.\n\nI've seen it develop from a basic game with only a couple race tracks andvehicles and a Demolition Derby arena to  almost a fully fledged game.  Of course it's still a long way from being finished, but the dev's have been working on the game  constantly and updating fairly regularily.\n\n\nI do hope we see the wacky  games that were included in the  first three games as they  were one of the reasons I love those games so much.  The other was the destruction physics.  In this the dev's have excelled.  What we get now are some of the best damage physics I've ever seen in a game.  All we need now are   loads more   tracks  to race around.  The graphics are also an improvement on the originals.\n\nTo the dev's I do hope you are going to add more  rally like  racing routes?  The ones  in Flatout 2/Ultimate Carnage were brilliant.\n\nI highly recommend  this game to anyone who likes vehicle based games.  It's definitely not your standard racing game.  Instead you get something that's  a lot more fun to play.","August 4, 2015","true","20.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

While it's fun, there's not much here so don't expect to play for hours on end. You're given what is basically a place to test game physics as well as the very early basics of the game. The latter is where the fun really is. You're given 3 car types, that can be modified. There's a demo derby, a figure eight track, etc. Not much, but enough to get a good solid glimpse of what's to come. You'll be racing around with a few dozen other cars, and expect the track to quickly get littered with debris. Everything on the cars seems to be deformable and destroyable. The walls, bails, tire piles, etc all seem to be too. Don't expect to bounce off a wall and keep driving, this is much more realistic and you're going to get wrecked. That said, it's not SO realistic that you're out of the race after you've crushed your car into a cube. Of course that's part of it's charm.\n\nI'm looking forward to this being fleshed out more, and when this goes multiplayer it's going to be a huge hit!","March 4, 2014","true","10.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Just like Destruction Derby on the Playstation but BETTER, Next Car Game revives the child in me that just wants to see cars DESTROY eachother! Car parts, tires, bumpers go FLYING along with destructible enviroments like concrete and tire walls. First person view included! You can see the window smash before your very eyes as you ram your vehicle head first into an oncoming opponent.\n\nTwo gamemodes, Classic derby and Race track (two race tracks to try) for alpha. Derby is like an Arena but the gladiators are CARS. You can choose if you want to compete against 12 or 24 opponents, free for all, always. When you drive straight into the middle at full SPEED you don't know where you'll end up and all you see is smoke and fire until everyone clears and your lying upside down in a graveyard of metal and glass. The ANTICIPATION is amazing when you're tailing an opponent and you yell "Boom!" as you drive into them causing mayhem as you do.\n\nThe race tracks are even better. Choose 12 or 24 opponents, race on gravel or tarmac. Drive fast and never look back because everything happens in front of you. Cars flip, roll and burst into flames. You need to dodge your way to first place and when you're there you need to watch out for opponents that will try to take you out with force, be prepared for anything.\n\nI was rolling in tears as I witnessed an opponent drive off a ramp and out the stadium, next, two vehicles persued me and tried to elimate me from the Derby so I slowed down, spun left and watched them collide into me. All I saw was blue sky and then I hit the road and landed safely on my wheels but half of my vehicle was missing. Collision is everything, your car will literally dissapear as pieces of it get lost in every collision, so make sure each one counts.\n\nI was driving fast down a long road then I came to a left turn and slowed down. What I saw at the bend was pure chaos, some vehicles had driven into the barrier and blocked the road so everyone had to drive through them. I made my attempt and piled into the mass, I couldn't see what was in front of me from all the smoke but I finally made it out and realised I had two vehicles in front of me driving the opposite way!\n\nAt the finish line I was making it into my second lap of the race but my driving skills were put to the test as wrecked vehicles littered the entire course from the first lap, I went left then right then left again and thought I was through until two drivers came hurdling from my right, one of them flipped and rolled across the track and suddenly I had to dodge a moving vehicle! My heart was racing. I came 13th in that race. I am yet to come first in any race.\n\nJust like Destruction Derby only better. You'll laugh out loud and be amazed at all the insane driving action that takes place in NEXT CAR GAME.","January 15, 2014","true","7.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This was written when the game came onto steam at the time of the first patch, and I must say, the game is so very polished, oozes such passion from the developers and is so much fun it's worth it's money even now when it only has 3 tracks, 2 cars and 3 race types. It's already got the beginnings of a great-looking upgrade mechanic for the cars and an amazinh damage model. It works without crashing on my machine and I haven't seen any complaints about stability - in an EARLY ALPHA for hell's sake.\n\n\nBugbear are the creators of Flatout 1, 2 and Ultimate carnage (but not Flatout 3) so you know they know what they're doing with a destruction racer such as this (yes I think I just made that genre up myself, who cares it's that amazing).\nThe game also has native controller support already so any controller you use doesn't even need any setting up (and at moments it does seem like a controller is the better way to play the game - although the KB works aswell.)\n\nIn conclusion the game is definetly worth your money right now and I would recommend it to anyone that has played FO1 or 2 and was left with a sour taste after FO3.

The physics are impressive, and the AI drivers are fairly challenging and have a tendency to smash into each other around a corner. It's common to see one or two of them get knocked sideways and flip over, and sometimes one will smash into a barrier and cause a pileup.\n\nIf you've ever played a Flatout game, it's like that but with better physics, prettier graphics, and less screaming.","January 17, 2014","true","11.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Hmmm let me think... HELL YES!\n\nThis game is what every racing game SHOULD be. It's amazing, the damage engine is wonderful. I'll admit it won't run well on lower end systems, my computer can handle high settings but my laptop (GT 750M, 12GB RAM, i7 4th gen etc) can run it medium-ish settings at a constant 40-50fps but does have lag spikes if there's a lot of carnage going on. But don't let that deter you from purchasing this game, I've played this on an average laptop using the intergrated graphics and it runs actually okay as long as the graphical settings are at low.\n\nNow to the actual gameplay. Racing, crashing, debris everywhere... it's so fun. Sometimes I just find myself hiding in a corner of the map just watching the AI do its thing and boy does it! The AI will ram you until you're on your last legs and then kick you with its tires while you're down.\n\nCompleting a track...? Pffft, as if. I've never completed a track and that's what makes it so wonderful. I don't even want to finish a track, I just want to crash into people and make other cars flip.\n\nI really enjoy this game and you should too. I recommend this to every friend I have and so far... none have bought it but that's because 95% of them are console users but who cares!? I'll still spread the word!\n\nAnd now I'm going to play this kick ♥♥♥ game so good bye!","May 26, 2014","true","7.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I am writing this in July 2014 and it's not even in alpha; yet, the game still manages to look, feel, and react like you would expect a final product. Cars handle exactly like you would want them to handle, damage modeling is outstanding and overall the sound and graphics are impressive.\n\nTo me I am not seeing a $30 half made game. I am seeing an opportunity to fund something that could become something truly amazing and with the reputation that Bugbear has, I am sure we will see exactly that.\n\nSome complain there is not enough content and that updates are slow. I don't really see that. Content comes once every few weeks and when it comes it is impressive enough for me to launch up the game for another fuel-filled run.\n\nAt this point the pre-alpha has 4 cars, 7 tracks, full customization, LAN support, and full 23-vehicle races.\n\nThe damage model in itself is outstanding and more than enough for nuts like me to keep playing. Stupidly fun, amazing looking and more than a little chaotic I can easily recommend this game to people who like racing games and/or breaking stuff.\n","July 4, 2014","true","19.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The damage you can cause and take, how your cars get beat up as the race progresses and just how gorgeous the games they make are. As it stands the only thing I can count against it is that the multiplayer lobby is skeletal at best in features and that it could do with a bit more optimization, but that's it. The game feels good, racing is fun, derbies are violent and funny, and multiplayer really is where the game truly shines at the moment.\n\nDo remember that this is an early access review though, and the game is missing a lot of features still (like the entire singleplayer campaign), so take that with a grain of salt. :)","November 6, 2014","true","2.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

(Extremely easy to mangle it up with a small collision.)\nEven though I can only base this off of from what I've seen from having been in multiple car crashes, and viewing quite a few first hand; it's still just my opinion. Doesn't take away from the quality of the game, nor does it make the destruction any less realistic.\n\nI would say look into the game first, and if racing/ heavy descrution sounds like a game for you, then it's probably worth the buy.","January 15, 2014","true","17.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

To all of those people expecting an upgraded version of Flatout, don't buy it yet. It needs A LOT of work to come close to that. But if you are look for a game that has a clear potential of being so, then this is the one to buy.\n\nOne of the best parts of the game is clearly the realistic soft body system. The metal bends according to where you hit the car and how hard you hit the car, something which you often don't see in racing games. There is a problem to this though... it is too realistic. During these few minutes I have been playing I saw 2 cars with their roof literally flattened to the point the driver should have been killed... and to the point where the steering wheel popped out of the roof so yeah, the car's soft body physics are taken seriously too far.\n\nThe game modes that are offered are vast for a game in pre-alpha. Figure of 8, plain old destruction derby, mudbowls, you name it. Although this game is meant to be a destrction derby type of game, I would really like to see tracks where you can plainly race since it would give you a relaxing breath after all the mayhem.\n\nThe car choice so far looks promising, although I hope that more are added tp the list... much more. I mean 10 cars is hardly a selection right? But the models are awesome, nothing too flashy but don't all look like rust buckets. Another interesting feature regarding cars is the ability to change its parts. For example, you can change your stock exhaust manifold to a racing exhaust manifold provided that your car is compatible with the upgrade.\n\nSomething that really sucks though is the career... because there is actually NO career mode yet. For f***'s sake why the hell didn't you include a friggin' career mode?? People, this game has been in early access for whole months and it doesn't have a simple career mode yet? So yeah, no career mode yet...\n\nAnother thing that I really didn't like is the fact that they put in the feature to repair your car's parts as they can be bought in a used condition thus not being totally efficient... but you can't use it for some reason. So the button is there, the concept is on the plate in front of you but you can't touch it cause your hands are tied behind the chair. That's exactly how it is.\n\nFinally, I would like to talk about the game's damage system. It is total bull****. I seriously wouldn't recommend hitting the other cars, in fact avoid them. This is because you will get huge damage all the same. In destruction derby I ended up finishing 22nd but I was (according to the statistics at the end of the game) the hardest hitter... so shouldn't I have the honour of being 1st?? Especially if I wasn't hit during any part of the race but only hit other cars?? Yeah, it needs some work.\n\nIn conclusion, although I like the game so far it still isn't worth getting at full price. But if you manage to find it on sale grab it. I did have fun playing this game but some crucial details are missing, and they must be implemented fast. The developers are getting lazy as a lot of games that were in early access after it were completed before it. And honestly I don't want to feel that I wasted my money on this, it has the potential to be a GREAT game.","January 2","false","3.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I bought this game originally months ago but it felt more like just a little tech demo because there was no progression or point to actually play it. You could play as any car (of which there were few) and on any track (again, there wasn't very many tracks) so I got bored of playing pretty quickly. With the recent update, there's almost a point to play it because you have to buy the cars and there is upgrades to do to your cars. That being said, you can buy whatever car you want and max out it’s upgrades pretty quick, so again with the lack of depth. The “market”\nmakes it feel like you’re actually a mechanic/driver and you have to surf the local classifieds to find parts and trying to get the best value, but since there's only a couple of options for each part, you can't really customize your cars as much as I'd like. Speaking of cars, they look amazing and are incredibly detailed but the in-game world still needs some graphical improvements. The maps looked great a few updates ago, but were somewhat recently decreased for the sake of new suspension and traction simulation. According to Bugbear, it takes about three months to create a new car, start to finish, which is understandable considering how much work needs to go into each one. But it’s still a bit ridiculous. I wish they had a bigger budget and team so it could be finished sooner but I'll keep waiting for this game to be legitimately completed. Until that  day comes, I still can't recommend this game. Bugbear has set the bar for themselves pretty damn high for themselves and I see this game being one of my favorites once it's finished. People tend to give this game pretty negative reviews because they say it's been abandoned by it's developers and it's a waste of money which isn't true in the slightest. Building this game is a huge undertaking and for it to be done by just a handful of people is going to take a while. If it had the budget and team of a triple-a game I'm sure it would be a completed full release by now.\n\nTl;dr- Fun game, but unfinished. Looks fabulous, cars are incredibly detailed and have soft body physics, but I wouldn't recommend buying it-yet. The day it's finished, buy the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.","January 24","false","6.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

As promised, the update changed the physics of the game to make it more realistic. Whilst I don't mind the new handling charateristics of the cars, a lot of what made this game fun has been lost. Cars no longer crumple up into impossibly small spaces and produce a lot less debris when smashed into. Everything seems less destructable. The handbrake also does nothing any more, which is really sad. I hope that's just a bug and not a feature. Weird that after eventually choosing the name Wreckfest that they decide to remove the "wreck" part. Pre-update this game was very silly, and that's what made it fun. Now it's just a generic semi-simulator racing game, and there are better examples of those available. Kind of sad, as there was only one mad demolition game around at the moment. Now there aren't any.\n\n\nJust thought I'd add to the "beware of no updates" theme in the reviews section. This is genuinely one of the most fun racing games I've ever played, but at present it's little more than a tech demo and has been that way for months. The single player is incredibly shallow, with no currency or progression. It's the equivalent to arcade mode on Gran Turismo; fine for a one-off race, but not something you're going to find yourself playing for hours.\nThe online is where I've found most of my time being spent. It's great fun tapping the guy in front of you, watching him lose control and smash into the chasing pack whilst you run off into the lead. But again, it's all so shallow. There are no ranking tables or race series - every race exists as a one-off. The online experience itself isn't great, as you're often forced to wait 5 minutes staring at a list of racers whilst they finish their current race, with seemingly no way to spectate.\n\nI bought this game in good faith that it'd improve over time, but with several months having passed since the last update, my faith has gone. It might turn out to be the great game that it deserves, but my advice for the moment is save your money and see what happens.","May 11, 2015","false","13.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Tabloids","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034823626/","440 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n21/05/2016\nMod support is live and breathes new life into this game.  It even has Steam Workshop Support!\nPlayed around with some modded tracks in multiplayer earlier in the week and it was some of the best fun I have had.\n\nBuild dated 23/03/2016.  Original review at bottom.\nTime for me to do a real review of this game.\n\nIt's been an interesting journey through early access with this game.\nWhen I first started playing in 2014 it was mostly a game about crashing cars, doing jumps and getting stuck on Sandpit, and the highlight was getting screenshots of massive crashes.  It wasn't until they added multiplayer later that year that I really 'got' this game.\n\nAt it's heart it's a multiplayer party game.\nGo nuts with people online and have a good time.  Crash and bash, go for the fast laps, or race somewhere in between.  Its up to you.\n\nFor me its the first car racing game that I really enjoyed.  Multiplayer is so well done, and so darn funny even after 200 hours in game.  I've seen so many crazy things.\nRecently I've been doing barrel rolls in lawn mowers, and watching my girlfriend beat the best driver in my region due to an AI car wiping out his lawn mower.  I even saw lawnmowers flip European minis, collide in mid air and punt the rag doll driver 20 metres down the track.\nLawn mowers are great.\n\nOne of my favorite old memories of this game is everyone on the server getting thrashed by one driver in the races, so that fast driver asked if they could go backwards.\nSo for the rest of the races, we dodged them while racing amongst ourselves.\n\nIronically, it's even become a good place for clean racers.  Because small crashes between drivers don't screw up your race as badly as they do in sims like Assetto Corsa.\n\nI've watched the game evolve a lot.  At the end of 2014 when multiplayer was added it was an arcade racer where cars were crazy fast around corners.\nIt was light on content, but a heck of a lot of fun.\n\nOver time, and with some lengthy delays along the way the game has been moved slightly closer to a sim racer.  You can still wipe out in a big way on a corner or against the bumper of a derby car, and get yourself back into the race.  However its not quite as easy to control, and car damage affects your race more than it did when multiplayer first came out.\n\nBeing able to choose and buy parts for your own race car is another new sim feature, and currently the system works well.  Its awesome being able to up-spec and down spec your car for more or less speed while playing with different diffs and suspension, and the current repairs system means parts wearing out never has to ruin your tim with the game.\n\nIn early 2016 Next Car Game Wreckfest is still that same core game I fell in love with in multiplayer long ago.  The new tracks and cars added over time have been top notch, and every single track and car is distinctive enough to make it worth trying them all.\n\nThe addition of new game modes and tracks has made multiplayer even more hilarious, and its amazing to see what game types the community comes up with.\nIt's not uncommmon for me to log in 'for a bit' and walk away two and a half hours later with a massive smile on my face, having experienced things in game that I'd never seen before.\n\nWreckfest just needs a proper career mode, and more game modes, tracks and cars before I can recommend it to all.  The core gameplay is amazing.  All I want is more of it.\nIf a hilarious mulitplayer car racing game is what you are after then look no further.\nNext Car Game: Wreckfest is the game for you.\n\n\n\n\n(original review)\nHi I'm Charles Loris.\n\nI had it all on the racing circuit.\n\nA red car.  Stickers.  Four tyres.  And even a guy to change them for me.\n\nI still had to pump my own gas, but I was always a stickler for the simple things.\n\nI raced in all the big races.  I did so many laps in the Indiana 500 that my race team found me six hours after the race rolling counter-clockwise around my own bath tab, yelling "Gotta clean fast!"\n\nIt was a crazy time.\n\nIts amazing how it can all fall to pieces so fast.\n\nI was sued for a cool half mill when in the headiness of being a young driver I called my sponsor Red Bull the taste of a new generation while drinking water from a diet coke can.\n\nSome people would have gotten mad and blamed the man who put the drinks in my hand or my manager for hiring a fifteen year old to type my autocue lines, but I took it all in my stride.  I walked over fifteen press journalists and camera operators after slipping off the stage in a blur of flash photography and hurrying for the nearest stairs.  When the tv news completely ignored my embarrassing slip up and instead played the NASCAR prayer I knew my career was dead.\n\nIn my next race I took a wrong turn, took out four cars, and skewered a dart board right through the middle with a track side dummy I hit and sent flying into the nethers.\n\nRumors spread that I had been driving while drowsy and that news soon reached my manager.  I was out on the street.  Destitute with nothing, but a race car with no tyres and 13 rolls of sponsor stickers to keep me warm at night.\n\nIt was a tough time, but then I found this game.\nAnd I was hooked.\n\nI used a USB stick to get my now non-moving race car to run Windows OS and used my steering wheel for a controller.  Combinations of the buttons for opening my car trunk and hood were my a and b buttons for navigating menus.  At first my neighbours (mostly pigeons at this stage, don't ask) all told me I was mad.  But for the first time in years I had a real drive.\n\nI sent my car hurtling over hills to take shortcuts.  I drove clockwise around an oval track.\nI even used destruction derby as a way to get revenge on my racing enemies.\n\nAll this I did with a shouty glee.  When online mult-iplayer rolled around I had to get in on it.\n\nI single handedly towed my tireless race car to a non-parking zone, where I knew I could get a free tow service closer to McDonalds wi-fi.\n\nSure I had to stay in my car permanently as a protest to prevent my not-so-mobile home from being crushed into a cube, but it was worth it.\n\nI even got a new job snitching to police about local gangstas trying to use the car compactor to hide bodies and evidence, but I digress.\n\nOh the online racing!  How my heart did leap when I first saw online multi-player destruction debies and rolled around the outside counter-clockwise while the young-uns pummelled each others chassis with reckless abandon.  The destruction was joyous.  Until I realised the game let me re-spawn and I realised I had to enter the fray to score a point.  But still for the first time I felt like I really truly "got" this game that I loved.  And it turned out that the game understood me too.\n\nReal life opponents asked me if they could drive backwards around oval tracks and I laughed heartily before allowing it.  Although I admit I have so far been too timid to drive backwards where others could see me.  I kept my secret joy for backwards racing to purer backwards versions of the tracks away from the prying eyes of the public.\n\nSo for now I have been living in my former race car in a wreckers yard a mere 15 feet from the local McDonalds for the past five months.  Every day I work hard on perfecting my laps and crashing strategies in this strange new life.  Occasionally I get on to the Steam forums and complain under my numerous aliases about the next update taking too long, but I guess that type of deviant behaviour comes too quickly to those who witness at least one murder and too numerous to count possum fights every week.\n\nFor now I must bid you adieu.  I look forward to seeing you on the racing tracks.\n\nKeep watching the mirrors,\n- Charles Loris","April 10, 2015","true","230.5"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","59","10","17","9","0"

The title says Wreckfest, the cars are bangers, there are demolition derby's and figure 8 tracks, so, you would think this is a game where hitting other cars isn't optional. And the title sounds kinda like an arcade game, not an simulator, so the handling will be pretty easy and forgiving too.\n\nWell, none of that is really true. Ofcourse you can hit other cars, but the damage you get is pretty high, so in no-time you are a burning wreck. A good strategy on a Figure 8 track is braking hard if you think you gonna hit a car. The best tactic in demolition derby is: don't hit any cars, And if you got to hit them, do it slow. Hitting a car at full speed feels like more damaging to your car then to the opponent. Clean driving is the way to go, that just doesn't feel right in a game called Wreckfest\n\nThe fact that the opponents are pretty are pretty agressive doesn't help either, they don't really know that it's better to drive clean.\n\nThe handling isn't much better too, it feels just pretty bad, not really diffucult or simulator like, but it isnt arcade either. It's a strange middle of the road way of handling, Throw in the agressive AI and your car sometimes spins completly out of control, but sometimes it does not, and just keeps going.\n\nThe damage models are pretty bad, cars crumple in really wierd ways, and damage hardly affects handling, even if 3 cars ploughed in your side, making your car a bit U shaped, it still drives wonderfully. Engine damage? Well, the panel says my engine is red and that's problaby not a good thing, but there is no decrease in power, problems shifting gears, strange clunking noises. But, one hit and it's in flames.\n\nSound is pretty good, but nothing special.\n\nGraphics were pretty good, but time doesn't stand still, and now it's just meh. Not bad, but nothing too good either.\n\nBut, all those things aren't the biggest problem.\n\nThe biggest problem is that updates are slow. The last update was in July IIRC, and that was a small bugfix. New tracks, new cars? Well, there were a few, but they got added 6 months ago, nothing new since then.\n\n"Get instant access and start playing; get involved with this game as it develops", well, in this case, it's more like "...if it develops". Yeah, there will be a real track, but, honestly, who cares? It is, or was, a game where you crash cars, i don't care if i do that on some real Finnish circuit, or on one that doesn't exist. I bought this game for some fun racing, racing that includes ramming, smashing, crashing, T-bone'ing, and some more smashing. If i wanted to race clean, i'd play Dirt Rally or PCars.\n\nFor now it is a bit of a frankenstein game, a part of it really wants you to smash right in that car because it is Wreckfest, and another part will punish you for that, because it is a clean racing semi-simulator.\n\nReally can't recommend this game for this price.","October 23, 2015","false","33.7"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","2"

There are plenty of serious racing games out there; something called Wreckfest was clearly never destined to join that group.\n\nThat next-gen update to Flatout, Destruction Derby or Test Drive: Eve of Destruction that we all want is going to require some more waiting for, because it's not here. It seemed like it was heading that way at some point, but that is not this game anymore.\n\nI'm so sad at what this game has become that I can't even bring myself to use a "took a wrong turn at some point" pun.","May 24","false","4.9"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","3"

I can't imagine how many hours I've put into that game alone. It had a decent number of cars on one track, and the tracks were absolutely mental. As a result, I enjoyed the immense chaos that was always had whenever I played the game.\n\nI thought I'd never find a game quite like it... Until I discovered this game. 'Wreckfest' (or whatever title Bugbear decides to finally give it in the end) is as close of an experience to that old PS1 game I've ever had. The game, whilst only still in alpha, has the option to play against 23 other opponents on a single track, and the current build at the time that this review was wrote, already has a nice selection of tracks to choose from. The tracks aren't as insane as the ones I came across in Destruction Derby RAW, they're still pretty hectic. The damage modelling on the cars is also brilliant to witness and having 24 cars on a small figure of eight track is pure utter chaos that I adore.  While I wish I had access to some more cars and the option to have more laps, I've been enjoying my time with Wreckfest and I do get the odd flashback of Destruction Derby RAW.\n\nThe game already is worth a purchase, in my opinion, and everything to be added on later will just make my experience with the game even greater.","November 5, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game loves to show off its astonishing attention to detail. When playing derby, cars could go so far as to be squished up entirely into a small box, but still remaining functional. It was awesome.\n\nThere are very few gameplay options currently (the game is still in early access, after all), including: derby, race, and tech demo (which is only available for those who purchase the game early). I had a lot of fun with the tech demo mode, which is packaged as a completely separate game. In the tech demo, you’re able to just drive around and test the game’s engine by running into various objects or placing your car into a cannon. There’s even a giant spider with rapidly moving legs, allowing your car to get wrecked simply by being stepped on.\n\nThe derby was also quite fun. It pitted a ton of cars against each other in an arena-like environment, with the sole goal of being the last one standing. I somehow won my very first derby (all skill, no luck …maybe). The derbies are very hectic and I spent most of my time waiting for other cars to get somewhat wrecked before I made a move on them, which turned out to be quite a good tactic.\n\nThe racing mode was not as fun, probably due to the fps issues I kept running into (frame drops down to 5fps?!). That was probably due to the massive amount of debris everywhere. I would think that the derby would have caused more lag in this regard, but it did not. I failed to get anywhere near 1st place during any of the races I tried.\n\nNext Car Game is fun, but severely lacks in features. I recommend the game, but I’d advise you wait for some more updates or for the full release before purchasing.","February 19, 2014","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So, the screenshots you see on the homepage are literally what the game looks like, and the crashes are NOT the coolest I've ever seen happen in this game. But really, this game is like the advritisements from other games, amazing crashes, a true sense of speed, and an always working crash engine to fuel it all.\n\nOn the topic of this games crashes, they are AWESOME the engine may not (arguably) be as precise as something like Burnout Paradise but the fact that it doesn't glue you to the ground and that it has no annoying "crash mode" makes it better than any other. It's a wierd thing to describe but it feels like the crash engine is always present, barring realistic car weights your not glued to being in the upright position, and if your not good, you can end up roling over other cars or even getting stuck in other cars (it happend to me, not a glitch or bug, just the physics engine working)\n\nSpeed is not the coolest part of this game but it is as good as any Need For Speed or otherwise good racing game, the turning and driving feels heavy yet controled, as if your piloting a muscle car, but it isn't as heavy as it is satisfying, and sure as hell, bumping into another car is satisfying as hell.\n\nLast minute details, it does offer controller support, it does have different views including a realistic cockpit view, and it has JUST enough content to be satisfying with three race tracks and one derby stadium.\n\n9/10 if full game                                          10/10 if considered as a beta                              11/10 as considered as an alpha","March 4, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Some of that is due to the sensitive keyboard controls, some of that is due to the exaggerated (but awesome) physics they have included. Car damage greatly affects handling, which is a nice touch. Bugbear is aware and will be tweaking the controls.\n\nGraphics:\nA huge improvement over the already nice looking Flatout 2. It's obvious there has been tons of work on the engine. Volumetric smoke & fire, dynamic shadows & lighting, god rays, high res textures, full anti-aliasing, particle effects, etc. All standard camera views are provided including in-car which is awesome during a durby. It looks like the CryEngine.\n\nPhysics:\nThe main selling-point is obvious. A very robust physics engine that affects all aspects of the game. Most of your vehicle can be damaged or ripped off. Terrain gets grooves from tires, concrete barriers smashed, signs fall over, waves of tire walls punted across the track, skid marks stay, glass shatters. Damage is modeled realistically yet exaggerated for entertainment.\n\nTracks:\nThe beta is only provided with 3 tracks. 1 derby & 2 races. Very basic, feels more like a tech demo. Bugbear has admitted they are only for demonstrations.\n\nCars:\nOnly 2 included in beta. 1 muscle & 1 euro-compact (rear engine!). Marketing says their will be a lot of cars. A garage to customize & mod them. None of that is in the beta.\n\nPerformance:\nI couldn't run it on max (but god was it glorious looking when I tried) the framerate kept dipping during the intense action. It doesn't appear to be because of any optimization issues, it's just that demanding. I could run it on High settings fine. People on the forum have had good performance overall as users with high-end vcards are able to play it on max. FYI - i7 920, 6gb, GTX 560\n\nOverall:\nWhile my overall opinion is positive they still have a ways to go. There's not a ton of content at the early access price right now and it feels more like a tech demo (which is actually included with early access). I think it's obvious they have the framework laid for an amazing following to the Flatout series. As long as they add-in some of the missing features from Flatout 2 (which is on their road map) and tweak the handling - I'll be happy.","January 22, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A real car will not handle very well when you slam that much horsepower into it. youre a maroon if you think otherwise. The handling takes time to get used to because its REALISTIC.

There is 1 race track and 1 derby track. There are also only 2 cars, but besides that the game is very good. The game does not crash and is a bit glitchy but I think that that is just my computer. The damage is kind off unrealistic, because i have gotten my car wrecked in ways that would have killed the driver. E.x. I have gotten my car swished into a pancake and still been able to drive it.\nI also wish that they would add more ways that the car can get damaged. Being able to pop tires and damage the radiator would be some cool aditions.\nI do not think it is worth $30 as of now, but maybe once they release some updates. My rating is 8/10.\nUpdate 1:\nSo the developers just released an update for next car game. It includes a new car, a new track, and a lot more control. There are a lot more car upgrades and there is more control over each race. The gameplay seems more realistic seems overall more polished. This gamew is a lot better and gets a 8.5/10 It is a large step in the right direction.\nUpdate 2\nAs of April 13, 2014 they have only released one update that added a car and a redesigned track.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blobbem/recommended/228380/","Blobbem","Blobbem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blobbem/","75 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOne of my all time favourite racing games is an old PS1 game known as 'Destruction Derby RAW'. I can't imagine how many hours I've put into that game alone. It had a decent number of cars on one track, and the tracks were absolutely mental. As a result, I enjoyed the immense chaos that was always had whenever I played the game.\n\nI thought I'd never find a game quite like it... Until I discovered this game. 'Wreckfest' (or whatever title Bugbear decides to finally give it in the end) is as close of an experience to that old PS1 game I've ever had. The game, whilst only still in alpha, has the option to play against 23 other opponents on a single track, and the current build at the time that this review was wrote, already has a nice selection of tracks to choose from. The tracks aren't as insane as the ones I came across in Destruction Derby RAW, they're still pretty hectic. The damage modelling on the cars is also brilliant to witness and having 24 cars on a small figure of eight track is pure utter chaos that I adore.  While I wish I had access to some more cars and the option to have more laps, I've been enjoying my time with Wreckfest and I do get the odd flashback of Destruction Derby RAW.\n\nThe game already is worth a purchase, in my opinion, and everything to be added on later will just make my experience with the game even greater.","November 5, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/inzanit/recommended/228380/","inzanit","Patrick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/inzanit/","123 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSitting on Steam just a few days past, I felt the sudden urge to buy into this game. Next Car Game may not be the most ingenious title for a video game, but I can assure you it’s well worth the 20 quid (or equivalent) right now. I should note, it’s still in early access, don’t take this as a final say.\n\nFor a PC only game you expect top notch explosions, collisions, physics and visuals, and Next Car Game delivers in every one of those aspects. While small details may be missing, such as the steering wheel just being mute to a point where it’s rendered non-existent (literally), the pre-alpha for the game certainly impresses me. We’ve come to expect a lot from PC gaming, quite why isn’t clear to me, but at first glance, I’d blame it on the so-called next generation consoles. In other words, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC has long been outdoing the dust attracting heavyweights, and for an unfinished and incomplete game, Bugbear Entertainment certainly have crafted one of the best experiences, for me personally, in a long time.\n\nThere is no recipe for a racing game, sure you have the cars, the AI and the main aim, but it seems as if Bugbear have stepped into a gap for the genre. The option to go into a hardcore derby or race on an impossible gravel track just satisfies everyone’s needs.\n\nThe lack of tracks, cars and any real options will detract you from the game, but again, it’s pre-alpha. It has unfortunately fallen victim to the early access trap, which may not necessarily be a bad thing, it’s a pest that certainly has invaded, not only the Steam platform, but also the master race in general.\n\nI summarised the review in the introduction, inject your 20 pounds. Just get the game. You’re going to loaf the title once new features are added, for the time being, while it’s in early access, you can grab the game for considerably less. Of course if you’re a racing fanatic you can also obtain some extra perks if you’re willing to part with a little more cash. Enough advertising, back to the review at hand, for those who want to read more.\n\nWhile the game itself impresses in it’s relatively early stages, like I mentioned, the early access virus has infested every corner of the game. Just a while back, when Bugbear released the first sneak peak for their new title, money was already flooding in, for what? A mere crumb of the game. Sure, the mechanics were there (to an extent) and it did impress? I guess? It may have been a free sneak peak, but I can’t help, but think, the game has been a small cash grab for the indie company. It’s certainly an accusation I don’t write down lightly, but I feel as if this is a perfect example as to what an early access game is. While it works, the version you get to play, even if you paid a full amount for what could be a triple A title, you receive a condensed stripped down pre-pre alpha, which barely functions. Now don’t get me wrong, it does function, but barely. Not for what I would expect, the same can be said for the full game. There’s another point.\n\nI’m not in the know what state the game is currently in, is it done? (I know it’s in pre-alpha) Steam shows the title as ‘Next Car Game’ – So is the pre-alpha it, no more sneak peaks? I can deal with that, but the game has sneaked onto Steam, taking money, with what is just the sneak peak version two with added gravel and tarmac scenery.\n\nIf you’re looking for an easy-to-play racing simulator, this most definitely isn’t what you want. Simulator yes, easy, no. Having been through seven to eight races, on both tarmac and gravel, with the various tyres and engines and the default level 2 cars currently available, Next Car Game does not go remotely easy. There may be the practice options, tactically placed right down the list, but if you’re as professional as me, you will want to jump right into the 24 car race.\n\nAdmittedly, the races themselves may not be as fun, but there is a satisfying feeling to crashing into your opponents and racing to the finish. At this moment you won’t find a 54 lap frenzy, you’re limited to choosing between two tracks and racing for 3 laps. The three laps are a little disappointing, it’s not an option I would consider particularly hard to integrate, especially for a pre-alpha, but hey ho, it’s not in the game (yet). If you want the core fun of the game, where you spectate the real beauty of this game, play the Derby. More specifically the 24 car derby. The hilarious sight of a bonnet completely folded in itself, still capable of driving and crashing (purposely) into an opponent just sets me off every time.\n\nThere isn’t an awful lot to talk about, which you have gathered from the rather slimming context of this review. There are just two modes as of now, the derby and the race both with options for the number of opponents. You can change the spec of your car by upgrading wheels, better suited to the job at hand, and installing a more powerful engine. Customization is largely restricted however, with no alternative paint jobs and just a different car altogether, you won’t find your creative side come to life just yet.\n\nIf you’re looking for a cheap car game where you can really push the boundaries of destruction (and possibly test your PC), Next Car Game certainly won’t disappoint. But it’s far off a solid car game, at least in its early access stages. Bear in mind however, if you do decide to wait it out, you will be digging a little deeper into your pocket.","January 25, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Enough said, really. So far there is only 5 cars and a handful of tracks, including a tarmac, dirt, the 8-track and 2 sand tracks. There is also a few demolition derbies, where you fight to be the last survivor. That's the tracks I remember at the top of my head. The handling is well rounded, the suspension is awesome and the engine is realisitic enough to be fun. If it is too realistic, the cars will feel like paper and one blow will take you out (See BeamNG).\n\nRemember that it is still in alpha, and everything is a subject to change. There is still quite a few bugs, mainly video related. I've seen people with higher resolutions (higher than 1920x1080) having a problem at the moment, not sure if it's solved. Bugbear has stated that they will continue to work on this until it is a complete game, no matter how many pre-orders they get. So your money is in safe hands. They are very welcoming on the forums, so is the entire community. There is practically no flaming or anything negative going on what so ever.\n\nSo buy this game, fool around and be active on the forums. I highly recommend it!","July 21, 2014","true","27.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't buy it thinking you're getting anything beyond a simple physics simulator.\nBut stick around and it might very well be worth it.\nAs a fan of the Flatout series, I'm hoping this game will revive that same charm it once had.\n\nEDIT: Might I also add that, since it's been constantly updated, the optomization has been getting better and better.

You can change the parts of your car like tires, engines, and gears! But not that you only get the latest Early Access of this game but you get the Next Car Game Sneakpeak 2.0!! Otherwise You can do Demolition Derby, racing on Tarmac, racing on Gravel, and...a firgure 8 race!! You can race in an eight so it becomes dangrous to drive! Also, If your car gets damaged to much it will warn you in red "critical damage" so if you hit your car to hard on something or do a  couple of little hit you will be disquualified because your engine caught on fire! You can knock poles sown from bridges and you can make the iron lines (Watever they are, I'm only am 11 year old) and you can break the concrete bricks around the track, but you can also knock down iron fences in demolition derby!\n\n\nYes, they are trying to work on multiplayer and other stuff.\n\nReview on Next Car Game Sneak Peak 2.0:\n\nHave you ever wanted to crash your car by weird things? Well, you've came to the right place! You can get hit by spiders, hammers, and even AIs!! You can also do stunt like try to jump a spinning fan,  go high to try to get to the top gate, or even go to a passage that goes up and down and you can jump a ramp there!! You can destoy your car by going through a iron seperator, going through a smaller iron seperator, going through a long iron seperator, going down a ditch from an obsticle, springs springing you, and making your car crash into stuff (with springs) You can also destoy object like: AIs, poles, metal containers, and other stuff!

There are not many cars available in Alpha and no signs of fun customization to the existing 4 or 5 cars. I would like to see customizable paint and possibly stickers as well as items to aid your vehicle such as improved tires, brush guards, and nuts that look like balls dangling from your car. Other fun items to add to the car customization could be snow plows, spikes bolted to miscillaneous places, and maybe other items you would find in a redneck neighborhood/TMZ series.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/recommended/228380/","OperationalOperator","Ridah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/","519 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTechnically an interesting game. Its like the realistic Motorstorm mixed with War Thunder. They arn't realistically modeling the cars thus far, but there is a damage model there that can deform cars pretty crazily though its iffy. Sometimes your car will be pretty banged up but undriveable, while a friggan destroyed car with 3 wheels an one wheel in the middle of the front where the engine should be and the thing drives good as new. It could probably use some work and due to its more realistic take its not as stupid fun as Motorstorm but its a more intent type of fun.\n\nPlus its not done, yet. Its impressive though how much of the game they have together thus far, though its a bit over priced for the amount of content here atm, I think.\n\nTheres only a couple cars, and a handfull or so of tracks, even less if you count duplicates and similiar tracks. Not a huge fan of the tracks thus far aswell and am hopefull that a map maker is released that will allow me to create stupid maps everyone hates.\n\nThe menu makes me feel like they are going to handle the vehicles like War Thunder handled the planes, a crap load of them and lots of choices for each one. Though I might be wrong, but that seems like the route they are taking based on the UI and the game I played.\n\nUnfortunately like Motorstorm (which promised more than it did, in terms of every bolt and all that jazz being physically modeled or some marketing crap like that) the destruction is pretty simplistic in terms that the engine compartment could be destroyed but your still able to drive. Things arn't modeled to a high degree but your car is more like a tin can thats displayed and what makes the wheels move dousn't have any real relation to what you see aside from the HP your car has and whether its damage is critical or not.\n\nThat said its probably the most interesting driving game I have played in a while. Dirt 2 was great in its mix of arcadey and sim points (its the last real racing game I played) and so was Grid, but this game takes some steps more to the sim side while it still maintains being fun.\n\nWhat it desperately needs is dedicated servers. So many peoples connections just can't handle the 11+mbps upstream connection recomendation for this game aswell as I doubt their CPUs can keep up aswell. Listen based servers give the hosting player a homefeild advantage in terms of lag and reaction time that though minor at times can allow the host to slap you into the wall and win the race where when all on a level playing field he would be in the wall. FPS games have for years gotten crap for not having dedicated servers and when they don't have them they are usually regarded as casual games that don't matter about skill, this game is far from that and requires a good server and connection. Another point is stuff seems magnetic, as if walls and other cars have a sort of gravity that sucks you in at times though this maybe a result of latency issues or lag and not a design point.  Also more eastern USA players would be nice. Im sure content will be added later on in development and will be needed to make the price worth it today or tomorrow.\n\nOverall, its a pretty nice game that stands on its own as a decent in between arcade and sim racing while leaning more towards sim in some ways and arcade in others.","January 24, 2015","true","20.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

According to what has been done already and the devs plans (career mode fundations are there already, and we have a nice clue of what it's going to be), it's very promising. To the point that even simply spectating a race is fun (much like it's fun to spectate real stock cars races).\n\nAlso, networking simply... works. Though obviously, there's still too few people playing it to find a non-empty public race session 24/24, better try it during prime time for now, or with friends at anytime, or solo (though AIs may need some tweakings to be a bit more agressive, devs also plan to give them more personality).\n\nStability is quite good too. I played it several hours and I only had one crash to desktop.\n\nGranted the price is quite insane for an early access. I usually ignore such highly priced early accesses (for the principle only, it's not a money issue to me). But I finally decided to make an exception... and I don't regret that at all. To me, Wreckfest is now the best realistic stock cars games ever, even in its current state.","February 5","true","83.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Especially the multiplayer can give you a great time. As a racing sim driver my self I had to figure out that this game is not about winning in the first place, it is about surviving.\n\nThe game comes with a lot of great stuff like tuning options, very detailed cars and various tracks. The Early Access phase is not yet completed and the game has still a lot of bugs, no "storry mode" and the tuning sytem is also not quite finished. BUT the absolute respectless AI in Quickrace mode and the other players in multiplayer mode making game a serious challenge.\nThe updates are quite rare, but the Team behind the game is every time doing a good job, because if they release a new patch they are making big changes to the game. I own no Early Acces game wich provides so much new kontent and so little bugs. By every update they reduced the bugs and made it stable to play. In total my game chrashed just 4 or 5 times, every AAA title released by the big Companies in the last few years had more chrashes on my computer.\n\nTo conclude my Rewiew:\n+Multiplayer\n+Fancy cars\n+Tuning system\n+Challenging Tracks\n+DAMAGE!\n\n-slow development progress\n-rare updates\n-A little bit complicated to drive (Controller Recomended)\n\nAll in all the game is fun but it has it's weaknesses (F***ing Bots! They crashed me!) I definitly recommend this game but buy it when it is in sale 20$ or 20€ or whatever you ar using, is a god price.

The cars crumple and break down masterfully as they get hit. Unfortunately, the driver also gets squashed into weird shapes. At the moment there is no depth to the game and the scoring system can be weird at times. You get a free crew. You move them to any car at any time with no penalty. As you race, they get better (which allows them to fix an extra point of damage per go) and you get more money (which allow you to purchase better cars and better parts). Everything is available from the get-go and you can skip a lower tier (if one can call it that) car and/or part altogether and go straight for the last one from each region or group. From the first car with no upgrades to owning every car with all the upgrades took about two hours total. I even purchased two more crews at a grand each just so each of the three regions have their own crew. I don't even play the races as I didn't buy this game for that racing simulator experience ("Wreckfest", remember?). Though derby mode is a lot of fun, I often wonder why I didn't get a point for hitting another car hard or assisting in wrecking it. Especially when driving in a smaller (lighter) car, the damage you do to your opponent is often considered moot, even though there are clear signs that you made a fender or door cave in completely.\n\ntldr; Give it a go if it's on sale and you really want to get that Early Access feel, otherwise wait and see if things change.","May 5","false","4.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

And while yes, I am dissapointed at the pace of development and Bugbears apparent bankruptcy (google it), it is still an excellent driving game.\n\nThe car physics are excellent with a lot of attention to detail. Depending on your tires and engine power you get different grip on different surfaces and it's noticable. Feedback through an xbox controller feels solid and it pays to be subtle on the thumbstick, throttle, and break. It's beautiful, too, especially at 4k. Destruction physics look great and enhance the game because your wheels, body, and engine take damage during the race which can effect your driving. Multiplayer and online are a lot of fun if you can find other plays. The game's AI is a lot better than in other racing games I've played, too. I have just as much fun playing single player as I do multiplayer.\n\nThe problem with this game is the slow development and lack of direction. It has taken a long time to add features like new cars and maps. The menu option for purchasing vehicles and parts has been there since I bought the game but only recently became a feature you need to use. Also, the game promotes destruction but the latest update penalizes you for it by adding permanent damage to car parts so you eventually have to replace them. I understand the reasoning behind this feature but it seems counterintuitive to Wreckfest's nature.\n\nI don't think Bugbear is just going to dump this game on the modding community and bail, but they raised over a million dollars on their Steam Early access campaign and have only produced half a game in two years. If they can get their butts in gear and show some direction and start updating more often this could be the greatest racing game ever. It's a risky bet, but it's sooo much fun.\n\nIs the development process wonky? Yes.\nIs the future not so bright for this game? Probably\nIs it a fun game to play?

If your gonna be a pansy and rant on this recommendation, then just keep on scrolling, cause brother, im gonna tell it like it is.\n\nI played not even 8 minutes of this game before it was more than evident how broken and unplayable it was. I've played a lot of games in my life, but never have i ever encountered the problems this game underlined. The first and foremost problem that was provided by the maliciously made game was tha fact that IT COULDN'T DETECT MY NIVIDIA GTX 770M GRAPHICS CARD. I spend 6 of the 8 minutes i had in this game fumbling around in the graphical settings trying to comrehend why this "next gen" game had such difficulty finding my state of the art graphics driver. I'm not one to boast about my rig, but when your running duel GTX 770M's on a 8 core i7 overclocked at 4.2GHz, then run into the issue of, again, a so called "next gen" game, not even being able to locate or process what graphical setting it should prioritizing then the game is just a hyped of pile of ♥♥♥♥, im sorry but that is just the uncensored truth. Instead of enjoying this game at 1920x1080 i had to downgrade to 1280x800 with all the graphical preferences set to the lowest possible setting...and it still could not be played on the Intel (HD) 4600 graphics card that is standardized into my Alienware, unless i wanted to enjoy 3FPS the entire ♥♥♥♥ing time i was mashing the ALT+F4 button to stop this monstosity of cancer.\n\nProblem #2 is focused more towards the game developers rather the game itself. Congrats shitbirds, you succesfully outsourced a game that probably was a masterpiece if it stayed within your grasps. Instead you geniuses decided to cut the funding, wrap it up, and throw this game to the wolves. By that i mean the modding community. Now, if i can think properly like a normal human being, wouldn't the first thing that came to mind before making such a mistake in trading hands be "What is our current player/modder base"? or "What precentage of intake in our average gamer data quarry inticates wether or not we will take off or crash disasteriously into the ground IF WE OUTSOURCED OUR ♥♥♥♥ING WINNING LOTTERY TICKET"? I mean seriously, i watched Markiplier play this game when it first hit steam and i was in aw, the game ran smoothly, the graphics where state of the art for its release date, and it was every "smash em'up" type racing gamers dream...and then when you started raking in a little more dough...you cut your losses? like wtf?!? I just don't get it, i can't comprehend. I waited 2 years to be able to play this, and when i finally raked up enough money to purchase this game instead of focusing on college, bills, insurance, etc...all i was handed was a huge heaping pile of dissapointing ♥♥♥♥. Good job fellas.\n\nI mean, there is probably another ♥♥♥♥ing 300 issues i could continue to fill the steam community in on, but i just couldn't sit and bare the etrocity that was bestowed upon me. I think this game only rivals 1 other...E.T for the ♥♥♥♥ing ATARI...aka the race for one of the worst games ever. I mean, taking a ♥♥♥♥ and then putting a ruler to the damn thing would show more promising results at this point then this heaping pile of garbage...i had such high expectations for this game and when i got it i took the shot in the dark, i ignored all the negative reviews and all the hu-ha and all that to give your game a chance. But boy was i wrong, i almost decided to stream this too...and what a horific thought that is now.\n\nTo all those who can manage to, somehow, play and tolerate this heap of ♥♥♥♥, i commend you. You few are the troopers who stood there ground and somehow gained access to another heavenly ♥♥♥♥ing realm of sorts just being able to let this game detect your ♥♥♥♥ing hardware. I give this game a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ poopy buttplug out of 10...now excuse me while i go burn my eyes and cut my wrists. Vulture OUT!\n\n\n\n","May 24","false","0.1"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","12","22","3","0"

Not about the winning for me - its about the fun factor and if you can get a lot from that from this game.  Server browser and creator needs work. The developers really need to think about having a server that can be left on and rotate through maps.  clicking ready and ♥♥♥♥ is a pita.. I understand that having someone join a race midway is a stupid idea, so that needs to be mitigated but the servers should be allowed to have timers for hosts to leave their servers on, have map rotations and also have the ability to manually change the current map without having to disconnect everyone.. also the host leave should revert another avaiable on the net machine to host the game in progress.   other than this the actual game play is a winner. everything is destructable (well 90%) and that equates to a lot of mayhem.  top job. can't wait for more development efforts as if this is what it starts off with I can't wait to see what you do next.","October 24, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Haven't played a car game in a while that allowed you to so easily destroy your vehicle. Which, is definitely a good thing. If you like to race and do a bit of demolition derby, this game is for you. Also, I recommend that you check out their website. You can spend more money on the game and get more things if you buy it through their website. They will give you a steam key for it. If you don't want to put extra money on it, then buy it on here. But, I think the extra goodies you get are worth it.

With the assists they handle great and the inclusion of the ability to use a manual transmission gives the game a less arcadey feel.\n\nThere overall is not much of a game here.

Great Graphics and proper driving (feels correct when turning and breaking) you'll love this game, even tho its Early Access ATM its great you have 3 different vehicles to choose from 5 paint jobs each (all different for different cars) has Derby, Racing, Figure 8's. Racing with 23 bots enjoy the destruction and obliteration of the cars, and it comes with a technology demo where you drive around a limbo like area with many ways to destroy your car, reset it and smash into random driving AI .

It is in pre alpha at this time and is more of a test bed for the final release. There are only 4 cars and a few tracks, no real game modes yet like multi player and career mode. This game shows a lot of potential so far! Excellent physics effects, sound is great, graphics are great too. It also runs very smoothly and appears to be well optimized. The controls are lacking a bit on my X Box 360 controller though. The cars appear to change suddenly from snappy to sluggish and back again sometimes. I would also like to be able to fully navigate the menu with the D pad, which as of now does nothing in the menu. Those are really my only complaints about it, but this is a pre alpha game and is not even close to finished yet and they are contantly releasing fixes and improvements even now. The pre alpha release is a nice strategy as the developers can learn from those playing the game and improve it before final release, this is a very rare thing these days. If you want to get involved in the game and help the developers out buy it now, you will not be disappointed. Even with the few tracks and cars it is a lot of fun! It reminds me of some of the old school demolition games from the Playsation 1 era, which were always great.

The developers know what they are doing, since their past works include the Flatout franchise. The tweaks they have made are good most of the time, and it runs fantastic even on relatively bad machines. Somehow, and I don't if this is intentional or a happy coincidence, but even when the game is running at 10 fps, which is usually unplayable, you can still compete. A few things that I would like to see change would be the AI, or at least a difficulty slider for them.

Not much to say about the new car, just an old american sedan type, but the cusomisation has now been improved slightly. The new track however is the best part so far in my opinion, the fact that its a tight, short track and the cross section make for some awesome smahes and crashes. The only thing im not sure on so far is the fact the sound files of the smashes all seem to be the same ones looped over and over again, they need more of a variety, racing the 8 track with 23 other cars, the sounds that were coming from it sounded like my ears were being ♥♥♥♥♥...and not in a good way.\n\nAll in all this game gets an 7/10 from me, hopefully the future updates will make it even better.","February 28, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Blasting someone off the track and into a pile of tyres or a wall and watching pieces explode everywhere, only to come around the next lap and see that they are still there, it gives the race a sense of permanence, not just a sandbox with some crash physics.\n\nThe graphics and textures are all designed to make things a little less shiny and new. I love the look of the cars, scratched and cracked, rust patches, smashed glass, all gives the game the gritty look and feel I always felt was missing from a driving game of this nature, everything looks run down and rugged, the perfect setting for Next Car Game. I would much rather drive around a beaten up big block covered in rust with some badly painted flames smashing other beaten up cars, than crash a brand new race car into a wall for 5 seconds, something about it makes it seem more human.\n\nOf course, finally, the soft body mechanics. Nothing drives home a crash more than watching your car get crumpled as you smash into other people. I cannot explain how much better it makes the experience for me, when you have to adapt to the damage, where as in Burnout, you got respawned with a car that has slight cosmetic damage, in this, if your wheel comes off, you're doing without it or not at all. I took a heavy hit on the side, and my car was like a banana with wheels.\n\nThis is a brilliant racing game for fans of Destruction Derby and even the DiRT series. This is physics heaven, with a side dish of environmental destruction carnage, topped off with some excellently realised models and textures.  If you want Destruction Derby, welcome home.\n\n","January 21, 2014","true","81.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the assists they handle great and the inclusion of the ability to use a manual transmission gives the game a less arcadey feel.\n\nThere overall is not much of a game here.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDJKhaled/recommended/228380/","TheDJKhaled","DJ Khaled","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDJKhaled/","190 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet me preceed this review by saying just because I recommend not buying doesn't mean it's a bad game. In fact, quite the contrary. This game got a lot of public exposure around 9 months ago when a very early build was available for purchase on BB's website. NerdCubed's vid sold me on this game. And for a while, it was fun to play the occasional race, or for me, play the figure eight track. I dunno why, but that track is sooo satisfying. Anyway, the reason most people are furious is lack of updates. This is the reason I recommend not purchasing right now. Allow me to explain:\n\nThis game is funded entirely off of BB. There is no pub like the Flatout games. When BB first gave the public this game, they expected maybe a small portion of the hardcore FlatOut crowd to be interested and back the game. For this reason, the game was somewhat small at first. However, many people bought in after seeing how much fun demolition derbys are and thus, BB realize the game in its then state was far too small. What BB did next was no small feat: over the course of a number of months, they completely remade the engine to allow for the ambitious game they are now developing. Support for 24 player multiplayer sounds like a minor update, but considering the damage models and realism of the game the net code had to be optimized and overhauled, as well as other key aspects of the engine. Inevitably, as happens in programming, methods affect methods, blah blah blah, and lots of things got messed up. The physics are really messed up, the cars handle like ♥♥♥♥, and damage numbers are too high or low. What's currently happening (and why a stable update has yet to appear in recent months) is they are doing their best to revert everything back to the way it was in the original public release in this new engine.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I'm as frustrated as the next NCG fan. I bought this game before it was even on steam. However, people need to understand that this is what happens with EA. BB has not abandoned this labor of love; in fact, quite the contrary. Weekly updates are pushed to the BB blog and the steam forums. Just be patient guys.\n\nAlso: If you saw videos of the game from way long ago and are craving some action, the game comes with their sneak peak 2.0 which contains the old engine and also an awesome playground to play on.\n\nTL:DR- This game is going to be phenominal when BB is done with it, emphasis on when they're done with it. I can't recommend this game now because of the lack of updates. If you're a super mega fan of BB or Flatout or whatever, grab this on sale and play the sneak peak to your heart's content. Until then, wait for future updates.","April 2, 2015","false","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That being said, this game is so much fun to play. I love the amount of destruction that can be had in this game. Haven't played a car game in a while that allowed you to so easily destroy your vehicle. Which, is definitely a good thing. If you like to race and do a bit of demolition derby, this game is for you. Also, I recommend that you check out their website. You can spend more money on the game and get more things if you buy it through their website. They will give you a steam key for it. If you don't want to put extra money on it, then buy it on here. But, I think the extra goodies you get are worth it. Their tech demo is so much fun to play as well.","June 23, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most everything responds nicely to crashing into it.  It takes some getting used to how destructive the environment is to your car.  While I would love to see more traditional racing types replaced with more experimental and fun game types that take into account the vast amount of deformations the car can have, it is incredible in its current iteration.\n\nI can say pretty safely that this style of physics deformation is now the standard that all other car games must match.  No more indestructible car crashes.  If you crash into something fast enough your car should turn into a super compact.\n\nAs well the game is screaming for multiplayer, but I am okay waiting for that feature to make sure the main game is complete.\n\nThe subtle detail of each crash makes is worth paying attention when you play, to see all the bits of car laying on the track when you are racing.  This also means the terrain can be a part of the race, quite literally when you knock a fence over in the middle of a race.\n\nThe demolition derby section almost needs additional car armor so that each car doesn't get destroyed too soon!  Overall this is a very positive car experience.  Can't wait to see the final product.  There are a number of new tracks to explore now also.","June 30, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have 4 cars that behave very differently and several tracks, beautiful graphics and really good physics. You can modify your cars performance, handling, visual look and how it would perform overall to suit your driving style (If you want it to be controlled or completely wild, it is all possible).\n\nWhat really surprised me was that the maximum amount of AI drivers is 24. Like 24!!!. Its so much. The Derby is amazing. Flatout 2 was like what, 8 players only and this is 24. Insane. And you can change the values the way you want.\n\nYou can play tracks in the right way or in reverse, so the amounts of tracks where to race is basically doubled. There are Derby arenas (3-4 tracks), a traditional "8-track" and several circuit-style tracks. So all in all, about 10 tracks where to race.\n\nAnother thing that really made me love the game is the race replay camera control. You can practically do everything there. Once you learn the controls (really good to use with a Xbox360 controller !!!! *kudos to BUGBEAR*), you can create epic showcases of amazing races. And the free control camera is especially cool. You can even fly far above the track and look at the race "Micro Machines"-style. Also, Slo-mo is a real thing once more!\n\nI have not tried out the LAN multiplayer out yet (will do so in a few days), but for now, the game is really good and it is only going to get better.\n\nTO BUGBEAR: If you read this review, I would like to point out that adding Splitscreen option for local multiplayer matches is a good recommendation. I like to host frequent couch gaming events and adding Next Car Game to the already epic list of games would be perfect!\n\nKeep up the good work!

The damage model is similar to that of "Beam NG Drive" although to be quite blunt, Next Car Game blows it completely out of the water.  The handling is still to be improved but is getting there and the damage model is utterly amazing.\n\n9/10 for me so far, pick this up and it will already give you hours of fun :)","January 15, 2014","true","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WskOsc/recommended/228380/","WskOsc","WskOsc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WskOsc/","1276 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe following review is taken from Whiskey Reviews (http://wskosc.blogspot.co.uk).\n\nInfo:\nPlatform: PC\nRelease Date: 15 January 2014\nDeveloper: Bugbear\nPublisher: Bugbear\nWhere to get it: Steam\nPrice: Around £19.99\n\nWelcome to the first edition of Whiskey Alpha Reviews where we take a look at an unfinished game and see if it's worth buying in its current state and whether we think it'll be worth picking up when it's finished. Lets dive right in and take a look at one of the early crowdfunding success stories; Bugbear's Next Car Game.\n\nCurrently the alpha state of Bugbear's Next Car Game (NCG) is split into two different parts. One is the Sneak Peek and one is the actual early access portion. Lets take a look at the Sneak Peak first;\n\nThe Sneak Peak executable consists of a tech demo showing off the physics engine and soft body physics. You have a couple of features that aren't present in the actual game such as shooting various projectiles and instantly repairing your car and resetting the map's physics objects. There is only one map, a kind of destruction and physics theme park where you and several optional AI cars drive around suicidally trying to cause as much carnage as possible with the various jumps, crushers, grinders and giant robot spiders placed around the map.\nIt is hugely satisfying to drive the provided muscle car into a grinder and watch it get spat out the other side in a mangled heap only to find that it's still got one wheel on the floor and you can make it to donuts at near the speed of sound.\nSimilarly satisfying is the physics engine performance, admittedly my machine is pretty beefy but I didn't notice any frame rate drops right up to the point where I exceeded the number of active physics objects and started driving through them without collision. No small feat considering that there was a dozen AI and hundreds of active physics objects at that point on top of all the soft-body models too.\nSpeaking of the car models, they're high quality and composed of the emerging trend of soft body physics. This means that the model isn't a solid block that deforms when struck as in past games but is composed of panels and parts like a real car and it crumples as such. If something lands on the roof, the roof will buckle, if you put your car in a huge cannon half way and get hit by the launching mechanism it'll shear in half and if it gets hit by a giant floating hammer it'll be flattened exactly like you'd imagine a car hit by a giant floating hammer would be.\nPersonally I've had more fun with this mode than the actual game but that's largely because there's no progression implemented into the actual game yet so I often choose to boot up the Sneak Peak instead just to watch things get smashed for amusement.\n\nThe other half of the release is the early access version of NCG. This version is comprised of four cars and two modes, demolition derby and race across a handful of tracks and arenas. The presentation is familiar to anyone who's played World Of Tanks/Warplanes or War Thunder, with the garage being laid out exactly the same way as the hangers are in other games. Many of the functions such as research and repair don't work yet but the options screen for configuring controls and volume, etc is intact and functional.\nGetting into the game is as easy as choosing one of the four available cars and clicking play then choosing a course/mode and setting the various options like number of laps and opponents. The menu is well laid out and easy to understand and it wouldn't be surprising to see it still in its current form in the final release of the game.\nGameplay will be instantly familiar to anyone who has played any of the Flatout series (barring the one which shall not be named) with the cars being suitably high powered and easy to throw into a slide or turn without losing control unless you're too rough on the accelerator in a skid. It feels empowering and at the same time has that Ridge Racer/Flatout feeling of being right on the edge of maintaining control that makes those games so exciting.\nWithout the high powered crushing machines of the Sneak Peek it's evident just how much damage the cars can take from each other. Even in a hectic 24 car destruction derby you'll take huge amounts of damage before being out for the count but that goes for your opponents too; it's entirely possible to smash an opponent's car into a wall at 40 miles an hour and see them drive off as you back away.\nWhile it occasionally feels like you should have gotten a takedown with a particularly brutal slam the game doesn't feel frustrating as the AI tends not to gang up on you as much as in other games with similar modes and the sturdy cars make the plume of smoke and flame erupting from a destroyed opponent's engine way more rewarding.\nThe races on the other hand feel far closer to say, Flatout Ultimate Carnage than anything else. They're fast and brutal and can be over very very quickly if the fates align and you get to stomp your opponents into shrapnel. This is not a racer for clean lines and shaving seconds off your lap times, it's rough and tumble. Overtaking is often accompanied by barging an opponent into the side of the track or spinning them out with a well timed swerve into their rear wheels.\n\nSo is it worth buying right now? It's in a better state than many early access games and seems more technically accomplished than the alpha status would suggest but the occasional crash does still linger and content is still very light on the ground. If you enjoy smashing up cars just for the fun of it there's easily a couple of hours of fun with the prospect of an excellent game somewhere down the line. If you're a fan of Flatout Ultimate Carnage, NCG is pretty much the perfect spiritual sequel and if they implement the silly driver flinging mini-games there'll be a lot of potential for pure fun with a group of friends.\nAs an alternative to the more technical and buggier BeamNG Drive, NCG is way more accessible to the casual user and won't make you learn two dozen keyboard shortcuts just to reset your car or set up something to smash into but the crashes aren't as flashy in terms of particle effects or the number of car components but it's looking like NCG may end up with the spectacle of destruction carrying over into all its modes instead of being relegated to the tech demo.\n\nScore: 7 out of 10 wing mirrors were not harmed in the making of this review.","August 26, 2014","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is alot to customize your car with, from gear ratio to the differential, and i believe there is more to come. the game looks great, but the new engine is a bit laggy if too many cars are on the track. The car selection is a bit low, 2 muscle cars,1 sedan, and 1 beatle like car, but there is alot more to come. the tracks are very fun to drive, the dirt track has plenty of jumps, tarmac race circuit , and the gravel pit has plenty of things to ram the A.I. in to. there is multiplayer, but it is currently a LAN only, meaning other PCs in your house or you use hamachi to connect to your friend's PC.\n\neither way i would highly recommend this game if you are a fan of raceing games, Flatout (same guys making this game), or looking for a fun game","January 16, 2014","true","43.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It just needs... a decent soundtrack :D As it is the game still feels short but you can't expect much more from a pre alpha. The test playground on the other hand is an awesome addition (Technology Sneak Peek 2.0). Although there's no objective I found myself playing around with it for a long time just for the cheer of inventing new ways to destroy my car! I can't freaking wait for them to add multiplayer\n\nIf you like the genre just get it now.

As the game name implies it literally is a wreckfest. You can smash, bash and crush your way to victory or shame. The detail in the damage is so good even at this early point in the game, it's so good and so hilarious. If you hit a wall the wall crumbles on impact. When you do flips and get drawn back to the ground by gravity, the smashing of the car being crushed and then flipped over, rolled and turned looks and feels awesome. Wheels go flying, car parts and dirt. Even at this point there are about 4 cars that can be driven and a number of both derby and racing tracks that can be used. Multiplayer is epic. The fun of crashing and racing with other people is so much fun. I would highly recommend this game to everyone. It is fun, entertaining, epic, awesome, funny as and so good. I can not wait for the coming updates and the final game. If this is anything at all of what to expect right now Next Car Game: Wreckfest is and is going to be one of the best durby games. It will be up there as one of the greats.
