"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TWAG/recommended/281990/","TWAG","The Holy Twig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TWAG/","370 products in account","Edit: As of writing this review, I have 20 hours logged in Stellaris.  Stellaris has been out for 29 hours.\n\nThis is the story of those 20 hours.\n\nMy friends and I all arranged to play stellaris together on release.  I didn't know what to play until I remembered that happiness is a core game mechanic - unhappy people rebel, happy people don't.  I don't want rebellions, those make people even more unhappy.  If I took "Spiritualist," I'd get a nice 5% bonus to happiness.  Even better, if I grabbed "Fanatic Spiritualist" I'd get a whopping 10% bonus to happiness and wouldn't have to worry about rebellions ever.\n\nIt wasn't deep enough.\n\nI found the communal trait, which adds +5% happiness, and the charismatic trait, which gives everyone on a planet a +1% happiness bonus for every member of my race on that same planet.\n\nI had to go deeper\n\nI found out that by balancing my racial attributes, national ethics, and even my form of government, I was able to get a total +25% boost to my happiness.  I ended up as a fanatically spiritual, pacifistic race of charming people who just like getting along with everyone.  To top it off, I found the most fitting racial portrait - a classic grey alien, the kind you see in all of those old movies and tv clips about "Alien abductions."  Classic grays, but with a big, doofy grin slapped permanently across their faces.\n\nMy friends all started on the opposite side of the galaxy from me, so I was stuck surrounded in a sea of AI.  It didn't matter what I did, my people remained happy.  I manipulated my neighbors and pitted them against each other for my own gain.  I created a superalliance with my angry fungus neighbors and invaded the birds who were restricting my movement, distributing them across my empire while stripping away their power and influence even on their homeworld.  I shipped them across my empire, balancing them with my own grinning populace across the empire - we live on the same kind of world, after all.\n\nAnd we were all so, so happy.\n\nBut we needed more friends.\n\nSo I found some primitives, who hadn't achieved spaceflight yet.  I set up a research post and began lightly observing them.  Then, of course, I began the process of bringing them up to speed with the rest of the galactic community.\n\nI then genetically modified the boars to be just as happy as we are.  This is where this game is, now:  My friends are politicking on the other side of the galaxy, making and breaking alliances in power struggles that send ripples far enough that I've seen their effects over in my corner of the galaxy, where I've spent my time well:  genetically modifying the subjugated aliens of my empire to be happy, just like us.\n\nThanks to this game, I have been awake for 40 hours and it's finals week.\nAnd I have no regrets.\n\nUpdate from 5/11:\n\nI managed to explore around an unexplored chunk of the outer rim, finding several of my friends.  Meanwhile, I enlightened 2 more species and was working on a 3rd when we saved and quit.  They were fully integrated into my empire very quickly but we only bothered to modify one of them, as the other was naturally happy.\n\nMy alliance with the angry fungus was expanded with the addition of my super-xenophile cat-neighbors.  Fully 1/3 of the galaxy's cat-people population quickly migrated to my planets and set out being so productive and so happy as a result of being surrounded by my people that engineering them would actually be a waste of resources.\n\nThe Alien loving cats, the angry fungus, and I all immediately set about molding our corner of the galaxy's nations to mirror our own by invading them and "liberating" all of their planets under new governments we set up to be more sympathetic to our ethics.\n\nThe entire time my friends were wailing, moaning, and there was much gnashing of teeth as they were slowly ground down by a non-player Empire that was consistently thrashing their armies until, after 15 years of war, they managed to research better shield systems to counter their powerful lasers and turn the tide of the war and secure them a white peace.\n\nMy friend Joe wasn't so lucky and couldn't secure an alliance with the rest of my friends on their side of the galaxy before the same non-player empire declared war on Joe, took one planet, liberated another under its own new government, and vassalized him.\n\nThat's when we saved and quit until next time:\nIn summary:\nI'm slowly increasing in power and enlightening more races into blissful happiness as my friends are at constantly at war and Joe is getting vassalized by non-player empires.","May 10","true","223.0"," 1,651 of 1,727 people (96%) found this review helpful 1,064 people found this review funny","96","651","1","064","78"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MethTurtle/recommended/281990/","MethTurtle","ClassyTurtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MethTurtle/","147 products in account","Written at just under 40 hours gameplay time.\n\nTHE GOOD:I. - Customization of everything. First you start out with making your species, picking its homeworld type, leader, emblem, traits and more. You can also rename anything you want while you play. I literally have not found something I could not rename. Leaders, planets, stars, sectors, ships, etc. I especially like that there are 3 types of Space Travel: Warp Drive, Hyperdrive, Wormhole Stations. Each one works a little differently, and has its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nII. - Vastness. Unfortunately for me, I run Stellaris on a potato, so I am limited to the smaller size (150 stars). You can have up to 1000 stars on the largest map size.\nAs of patch 1.0.3, I can now run the game (mostly) fine w/ larger map sizes.\n\nIII. - Variety of systems. It’s got it all, black holes, pulsars, you name it. All sorts of interesting solar systems are randomly generated.\n\nIV. - Pops. I love the Pops mechanics. Every pop has traits, but they can diverge into different traits and ethics over time. Later on when I unlocked gene modification, my own people started modifying themselves and changing. I also uplifted some plant-people, then genetically modified them some more to make them a biogenic army invasion force to use against my enemies. (+40% dmg is pretty nice).\n\nV. - Fallen Empires. I tried to go to war with one of them. That was a very bad idea. I look forward being able to take on one of these guys at some point.\n\nTHE "HUH?":\nI. - Some very strange UI choices in places.It’s true, the UI is phenomenal compared to other Paradox games, but some strange things still lurk about. Quickly finding a list of all your trade deals isn’t exactly obvious. Another example would be edicts. All planets have them, but there’s also empire-wide edicts on an entirely different tab.\n\nII. - No Map Modes.In my first game I formed a Federation, half expecting a great merging color of myself and friends, showing our new Federation name. Nope. No map modes of any kind. (Allies, enemies, Alliances/Federations, economy. etc)\n\nIII. - I didn’t notice I was being invaded. Not until they were already bombarding one of my homeworlds and had blown up a space station did I notice. You only receive a small notification at the top when they enter your space… which will always be there if you’re within THEIR territory at the same time. This bothers me a lot.\n\nIV. - Food. Another bizarre one. Every planet has food production in addition to its energy, science and minerals. Yet, if I have a planet producing 11 extra food, and the pops are all filled, then what should I do with it? Well, don’t worry about that because you can’t do anything with it. Cant trade it, transport to your other worlds, sell it, nothing. Having extra food doesn’t seem to do anything beneficial whatsoever.\n\nTHE BAD:I. - The AI. I don’t even know where to start on the AI. It’s dumb. Really dumb. Even on hard the AI doesn’t do a anything that I have seen. The most interesting thing the AI has ever done in my games is go to war with their neighbor. Once. Nothing came of it. Another time three empires created an alliance.\n\nII. - The AI Really does suck.\nIII. - Sectors. Once your star empire begins growing for real, you’re going to have a ton of planets to keep track of. Thus we have Sectors, zones you designate by star system. It makes sense, and it essentially automates those planets for you. The UI for sectors is far from good, and needs many changes to be useful, but that doesn’t bother me nearly as much as the total inability for Sectors to automatically build Spaceports, Ships or Armies. This is downright infuriating, because you have to open the absolutely abysmal sector list, open each one, then click each individual sub planet within that sector and build a spaceport. This. Is. AWFUL.\n\nIV. - Trade/Diplomacy. Everything is wrong with this. I first noticed when I formed my first Federation. After managing to make friends by essentially giving away minerals and credits and repeatedly renewing research/star chart exchanges, we formed an alliance. This was very tedious even then, but I figured the real cool stuff would happen at Federation level. Boy was I wrong. Once I formed my federation…. Well that’s it. Nothing changed as opposed to an alliance. I figured some type of Voting system would be involved to vote on federation laws, kick members out, set Federation-wide Policies (Prohibiting slavery seems like a thing a Federation  made up of very different alien species would vote on, right?). This was a massive disappointment, there is absolutely nothing special about being in a federation. Except the Federation Fleet. You can build ships with all Federation Members pooled Tech, so they're the best ships you can make. Only the Federation President can make them, so you lose control after you lose your seat (alternates every 10 yrs between members).\nSo after waiting 30 years to regain my presidency, I am excited to see the size of the fleet.... THE STUPID AI DIDNT BUILD ANY. AT ALL. ZERO. IN THIRTY YEARS. NOT ONE SINGLE SHIP.\n\nThe Diplomacy Menu itself is another massive disappointment. It’s fairly simple, a list of trade deals you can do, but it’s missing such basic things… like the ability to see how many minerals/credits they have. If you try to trade 1000 credits for 1000 minerals or vice versa, and they only have 990, the trade deal wont go through. But it won’t ever say it didn’t go through. And they could have as little as 5 credits/minerals. You have no way of knowing! Additionally, where the hell is the button to trade food? Oh yeah, I forgot, food is totally meaningless in a huge, populated galaxy!\n\nLastly, and probably the worst out of everything… War is too easy. This may relate to the amazingly dumb AI, but every game I’ve played has been the same… expand first and fast, and then conquer my nearest neighbor and vassalize them. Now I have double the fleet because once I declare war on a second empire, my new vassal’s fleet attaches and follows mine. This immediately starts a huge snowball effect and my giant deathblob of ships just move on and on until everyone around me is my personal ♥♥♥♥♥. It shouldn’t be this easy. You know what would be great? If the AI empires around me, after I conquered Vassal number 2 or 3, pulled their heads out of their asses and said “Oh man. Let’s make an alliance and stop this crazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ before he comes for us.”\n\nV. - Endless Stability. For a Paradox game, I am just stunned by how there’s no infighting whatsoever. There are factions, but they don’t do anything. Rebellions are supposed to be a huge feature. If you’ve ever played CK2 you know how frustrating it is to be going through 20 years of civil war just because your King died while hunting, and his 4 sons decide to tear apart the Kingdom for the Throne. So where the hell is this kind of thing for Stellaris? Disabled, apparently. That’s right. They released the game without one of their most well-known mechanics. One day they say there will be a patch to enable rebellions and factions once again, but how they released it without it already working is just beyond me.\n\nStellaris is a very fun game. I enjoy it a lot. But there are some glaring problems (AI, trade/diplo, UI) that ANYONE at Paradox should have seen. In my opinion, they have essentially released a Beta. A very fun beta, but it clearly is not finished. I expect a stupid amount of DLC for this game, as their past titles had as well. However, if they expect me to pay for a DLC pack just so there is some kind of REAL DIPLOMACY/TRADE, they can ♥♥♥♥ off. This is something that should be in the base game.

To expand your people to the stars. You’ll soon meet some other races, and realize your destiny to is befriend/ trade with / ignore/ exploit/ exterminate these new creatures. As you expand through use of colonies and strategically placed flags (also called frontier outposts by the humorless), you will work towards your goals for (insert goals here). This expansion will not go unnoticed, and you’re sure to make enemies and friends among the other races you’ve encountered, whose visual appearance has almost no bearing on their preferred world. (Personally my closest ally is a bunch of Sea-warthogs, and I’m also trading partners with a race of desert penguins)\n\n\n\nCombat is interesting. The number below your fleet tells you an idea of it’s strength, but not the whole story. You’d be tempted to think like CK2 or EU, where if you have the larger force and a good general you’re generally come out on top. But that’s not the case here. Just ask the 1st fleet of the United Nations of Earth. Armed to the teeth with anti-matter missiles, and assisted by several dozen ships of our fungi allies, up against a force less than 70% of their size.\nYou actually can’t ask them. They’re all pretty dead. Point defenses turned out to be pretty good at point defense. So remember to not put all your eggs in one basket. Or Spores in one pouch, as the fungi say. Some missiles, some laser, spread the wealth.\n\n\n\n\nDiplomacy is fairly straight forward. You get along better with races that have similar morals to your own, and especially xenophiles in general, but through enough effort you can even getting along with xenophobes. (Those desert penguins mentioned above are kind of racists, but we get along alright). Embassies are a big help. Alliances can be pretty easily formed with those you get along with, and are a great way to both protect yourself and to make offensive wars easier. When declaring war as part of an alliance everyone has to approve it. This is made easier by distributing the war goals amongst the members. Basically a planet to the sea hogs, a liberation to the fungi, etc. Thankfully defensive wars are automatic. You can’t leave them hanging.\n\n\n\nThe science and tech tree is a bit different from most because it’s not really a tree. It’s a set of cards you draw that you ‘draw’ three from and then decide which to work on. But my favorite part is definitely the science ships. You’re essentially playing as the Enterprise, boldly going where no one has gone before(star trek theme plays here). You’ll run into all sorts of anomalies that require investigation. Sometimes it’s a whole story line about precursors, sometimes it’s just an old cruiser stuck on a planet. Sometimes you run into a system full of million year old mining drones and have to book it. It keeps things interesting.\n\nThe random events are very much what we’ve come to expect from paradox. A perfect mix of good writing and humor. Even the ol’ comet event comes around in it’s orbit.\n\n\n\nTLDR: It’s a really interesting take on 4x that is everything you should expect from Paradox, and sure to get better with time, and DLCs. A little difficult to learn at first but better than their other games.\n\nTLDR-2: Just play it.","May 9","true","33.2"," 2,013 of 2,405 people (84%) found this review helpful 1,295 people found this review funny","84","013","2","295","34"

Instead, I'm going to tell you the story of Admiral Cax.\n\nThe Tale of Admiral Cax, Hero of the Blessed Light of Toroba\nLong before he was born, Cax's people, an atomic-age civilisation of reptilians called the Netraxi, had noticed something odd about their leaders. Sure, they seemed fine from afar but on closer inspection they were just a little bit too...mushroom-y. Still, they shrugged and kept on doing whatever nuclear-powered reptiles do. And then the day came when the disguises fell and the Netraxi were taken over by the fanatically religious empire of slave-taking mushrooms that had quietly infiltrated their society using some questionable shapeshifting magic. The Netraxi were aghast. They were enraged. And then they were enslaved.\n\nThese conniving chantarelles, known to their friends (not many) as the Blessed Light of Toroba and their enemies (quite a bit more) as the Doom Shrooms, were to be masters of the Netraxi for a hundred years. For this darkest of centuries, the Netraxi slaved away to supply their overlords with ambiguously-defined but evidently useful minerals, their labour rewarded only with contempt, and a reminder to worship the God-Emperor of Toroba at all times. The unhappiest Netraxi were sent down the mines. The happiest were released, allowed to be outraged about their situation for a bit, and then enslaved again just for fun. And when the Torobin went to war, the Netraxi were chained together and dropped as a welcome-mat for the Toroban armed forces to march over.\n\nThose hundred years passed, and the Torobin began to see the Netraxi in a more enlightened way. It was decided that some - though not all - should be emancipated to test their loyalty to their God-Emperor. Surprisingly, they were indeed loyal. Within ten years, the remaining Netraxi had been freed, but this was only the beginning of the struggle for freedom, All across Torobin space, a dozen other races remained enslaved, and the blatantly racist policies of the Torobin meant that there was only room for Shroom in positions of power.\n\nAnd then the great, glorious and eternally enlightened God-Emperor Zifin I (may his spores find warm soils!) decided that one - but only one - filthy xeno would be given the opportunity to lead Toroban forces. His case would decide whether or not aliens were worthy of being equals to those they had once called master. They chose a lowly Netraxi called Cax.\n\nCax was a badass.\n\nHired at the age of 41, he was immediately thrust into the Toroban war of conquest against an alliance led by the Bavi, a technologically superior race. Four fleets were deployed: three led by Torobin and the fourth led by Cax. Almost immediately the fleets were heavily engaged, taking severe casualties. Cax was sent to support a Toroban admiral, but when he warped in he found the Admiral's fleet destroyed, the gallant mushroom shredded and scattered across the system. Undaunted, Cax sent his fleet into the attack and smashed the Admiral's killers, securing the system. As the Torobin lost a second fleet to the Bavi, it was only Cax holding the line that gave the Torobin enough leverage to force a white peace and retreat with their dignity intact.\n\nThis was only the beginning.\n\nCax was sent back to Torobos to rebuild his fleet and upgrade it, in the expectation that the Torobin would soon be having a second go at the Bavi. Five years into the refit, however, he received the chilling news that a portal had opened up only a few systems away, spewing forth energy demons that wished only to feast upon the mortals' planets. The unlucky star-system was consumed. And then another system fell. And another. And another. And then it was Netraxis' turn. Cax could only look on via his monitor as his beloved homeworld, his people that looked to him for salvation, everyone, were all annihilated in a heartbeat. As the Torobin military crumbled he took his fleet to the furthest sector, the Malthin Bulwark, and gathered his forces for a desperate counterattack.\n\nAnd then the Fox nation attacked.\n\nEither through cold malice or a hilarious inability to perceive the danger of FRICKIN' WORLD-EATING ENERGY DEMONS, the race known only as the Sly Foxes decided to attack the Toroban Glorious Alliance with overwhelming force, right along the line of the Malthin Bulwark. Cax found his reinforcements cut off, his spaceports attacked and his empire still dined upon by the dreaded Unbidden. It was then, in this darkest of hours, that Cax made his move.\n\nWith the Bulwark crumbling behind him, Cax launched a desperate attack against the Unbidden Portal with every warship the Torobin could muster. It was do or die. If he won, the Unbidden would no longer be able to spam doomstacks to conquer the ungrateful galaxy. But if he lost...the galaxy would be lost with him. At the age of 54, with a hundred warships in tow, this would be his finest hour.\n\nHe did it.\n\nHe frickin' did it.\n\nSurrounded by no fewer than three Unbidden doomstacks, Admiral Cax somehow fought his way to the portal and shattered the demons' grip on the galaxy, destroying two of the doomstacks as he did so. With his mission accomplished, he warped away to safety. Fewer than a third of his captains made it out. But the galaxy was saved. For any ordinary admiral, this would have been a time to celebrate. But Cax was no ordinary admiral.\n\nCax was a badass.\n\nBadly damaged from the Battle for the Portal, Cax immediately returned his fleet to the Bulwark and smashed the Sly Foxes in a series of fleet-to-fleet battles, taking the war deep into the enemy's heartland. A little too deep, some might say, because there was the slight issue of his fleet being surrounded and utterly destroyed, but Cax made it out and his heroic counter-attack had once again turned a losing situation into a White Peace. By now Cax was pushing 70. Time to retire, the Torobin said.\n\nBut badassery doesn't retire.\n\nCax immediately took command of a new fleet being built to purge the galaxy of the Unbidden for once and for all. Armed with the latest weapons and cutting-edge technology taken from the Sly Foxes, Cax's Crusaders came together from all corners of Torobin space to follow their inspiring commander. The liberation was long and bittersweet, as although Cax was proud to be the Admiral chosen to drive the Unbidden from his homeworld, he knew that only the dead would greet him on Netraxis. But liberate he did, and at the age of 100 he destroyed the last Unbidden installation and restored the lost worlds to the Torobin. In gratitude, the God-Emperor transformed Toroba into a Mega-Corporation and emancipated every last slave, all thanks to Cax's heroism. And they all lived happily ever after, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nHappily ever after is for people who haven't tried hard enough.\n\nCax had a score to settle with the Bavi. They had destroyed his companions in the Bavi War. They had stood back and watched as the Unbidden destroyed his homeworld. Worst of all, they were just kinda there, y'know?. And so, at the age of 108, Cax set out for one final war. The names and legends of that war still echo down the ages. At Zabeem it was Cax who ambushed the 12th Bavi Fleet and smashed it to scrap. At Gandaros it was Cax who rescued the allied fleets from certain doom. At Kovin it was Cax who held the line as fleet after fleet warped in and were suddenly, but unsurprisingly, vanquished. And it was behind Admiral Cax that the entire allied fleet mustered for the final assault on Hydrobius that ended the war. Best of all, the surviving Netraxi were given permission to colonise the new worlds opened up by the Second Bavi War.

It becomes quickly apparent that a lot of love and dedication was put into this title.\n+ Pacing. Never feels too fast/slow, except for endgame, which I shall be getting to.\n+ GUI is simple, uncluttered and thematically amazing, rare in strategy games nowadays.\n+ Beautiful OST.\n+ Choice of traits and governments is pretty damn fun - especially when playing Space Hitler/Space Jesus.\n+ MOD SUPPORT 11/10.\n\n+ Just buy it, man.\n\nCons:\n\n- While I have been fanboying over this title for a while and have absolutely fallen in love with it, there's no denying that the pace of your gameplay will slow down towards the late stages, which is expected.

I really like Paradox Games: I've played a lot of Crusader Kings 2, which I think is incredible, and I pre-ordered Stellaris wanting it to be really good. Knowing Paradox's history with CK2 and extensive DLC support, I think Stellaris in a couple year's time is going to be amazing. At present, with fanboy goggles off, I think IGN's review has it spot-on. The game has a lot of great ideas mixed up with weak execution. Considering the amount of hype and sales it's already got, I doubt my single bad review is going to tank this game, so I'm putting this here for the devs to hear some of the things that can be worked on.\n\nMy experience: The AI was so passive and my empire was so stable in the mid-game, I literally just sat and built battleships for lack of anything to do, and then when the [redacted] came, my 160k death-stack pew-pewed them into oblivion. I then sat and let the game run, and I now have almost every single tech. I'm not sure what's left to do.  I've stopped my playthrough because...I don't really want to go through the chore of conquering every other empire and there isn't really anything else to do.\n\nThe biggest problems in my mind are two-fold and related: a lack of mid-game goals, and a lack of meaningful ways to interact with the world at large.\n\nCrusader Kings 2 was fantastic because it tied all its game mechanics together with people with deep traits and interactions you could interact with in multiple ways. It also kept empires from becoming stale because any CK2 player will tell you the biggest challenge with empires isn't conquering people, it's keeping everything together when your leader dies and every single up-start vassal wants to rebel. Stellaris doesn't really have this: leaders lack personality and pops don't have the same impact on gameplay. In all my time as a slaving Penguin Empire, I never saw a rebellion or significant unrest. This makes the mid and late game very static: you don't have reactive goals like 'Murder the upstart Duke of Lombardy' in CK2, and it's made worse by a simple, standard 4x diplomacy and war system, so you rarely feel compelled to interact with the empires around you.\n\nAdditionally, Stellaris currently lacks tools to meaningfully solve problems. In CK2, dealing with eg, a useless heir was fun. Do I make him take religious orders? Marry him off to a foreign empire? Straight up murder him? Get him killed in a war? Stellaris comes close with some of the tools to interact with your alien pops, like slavery, gene modification, resettlement and edicts, but the way the game is set up right now alien populations aren't really a challenge: they don't rebel, or make significant demands for independence, or try to change your policies. So...you end up gene-modding them when you're bored, or when you lack things to do. Worse, and this is a big misstep, to deal with actual dissent the game just makes you pay some resources to make a 'Dissatisfaction' bar go down. Considering how well CK2 implemented rebellious vassals, this isn't really a good design decision.\n\nPROs:\n- Great empire designer\n- Engaging early-game, with exploration and anomalies\n- Lots of room to be expanded on\n- Genetically modify rebellious citizens\n- Meddle with primitive races\n- End-game crises\n\nCONs:\n- War is really, really tedious\n- Lack of interesting ways to interact with other empires\n- No real threat of rebellion from leaders/alien pops\n- Framerate drops at mid-game makes the game more of a slog\n- Creating sectors isn't as fun as having vassals in CK2\n\nEDIT: Welp, the Paradox devs have talked about how their mid-game content was cut last minute before release and they'll be adding it back at the end of June, plus bug fixes and changes to Sector AI so check back then with Stellaris if you're on the fence\n\nhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/05/16/stellaris-patch-1-1-content-plans/","May 12","false","43.8"," 1,152 of 1,404 people (82%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","82","152","1","38","81"

If you'd like, comparing to Civilisation, it is similar in concept in that you are managing your ever growing empire, maintaining relations with other empires, gathering resources and waging wars, but the system is somewhat more deep and complex in a number of ways. You must manage ‘leaders’ which includes balancing your investment in Science, Military and Government for example. There are various caps which mean that you cannot do everything at once and so must think about short term as well as long term goals in that regard. For those used to managing ‘population’ in Civ-like games this will not be too much of a step up.\n\nThere are other aspects to the game as well such as exploration, missions, research projects and events – should you use the in game tutorial this can help guide you through some of these as and when they appear.\n\nThe next thing to talk about is the level of customisation this game offers. To a new comer to the genre this will be very intimidating. I loaded up my first game having seen the huge numbers of different traits, policies etc for a given race only to find further customisation such as individual spaceship specifications and leader characteristics – it’ll be quite a challenge to try to learn these all at once so don’t try and just take it as it comes. I cannot say how it compares to games like EU4 and Crusader Kings in terms of level of customisation however as I have not played those games.\n\nThe gameplay itself is reasonably placed, there was never really a time during my time playing that I have felt like I have nothing to do. The only down time I did have was when I myself couldn’t pick a strategy I wanted to pursue – to try and explore more for potential research events, to try and get trade deals with my neighbours, to clear out nearby star systems of hostile space creatures, to colonise more systems or even to wage war to capture a system in order to preserve my borders and corridor of travel between outposts.... the list goes on.\n\nOverall I felt that as a new comer I haven’t been as overwhelmed as I thought I would be. Having said that, while the tutorial pop-ups are helpful, they are few and far between after you get the very superficial basics down and the in game help is ‘currently’ non-existent in any meaningful capacity. Instead of having a comprehensive Civolopedia or sorts the help button takes you to a Wiki which at present is bare bones and not helpful in the slightest. I spent ages trying to figure out ways to increase my influence and having narrowed it down to a building upgrade I couldn't then find anything about how I can get to a stage where that building is available to me. No doubt this Wiki will be fleshed out over time however.\n\nFinal points – the sound track is stellar *wink* and the gameplay is relaxing, reasonably paced and relaxing with the ability to ‘pause’ time while you manage your empire as it grows so that you do not miss anything important. During my time streaming in advance of release it certainly seems as though the community that this game will have will likely be helpful and welcoming as I had many enter my stream and point me in the right direction and clarify any questions I had regarding aspects of the game.\n\nLastly the game certainly has that “Just a little longer.....” vibe and I found myself wanting to keep playing after midnight, and there is a certain satisfaction upon seeing your borders expand and your navy winning glorious victories.\n\nStellaris gets a firm recommendation from me to players unfamiliar with the Grand Strategy and 4eX genres.\n\nI was given the copy for free but was not given any further incentive to be positive or negative. Keep in mind potential biases however. Feel free to ask me anything if you have any issues or concerns about what I have said with regards to this review.","May 9","true","16.3"," 731 of 878 people (83%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","83","731","878","27","28"

Being an intense Civilization fan, I've always found the games to lack a certain depth and scale to them.  Being a similarly intense fan of games like EU4 and CK2, I've always found they lacked the explore and developmental cycles found in Civilization games.  A yin and a yang if you will - which caused me to always only partially scratch the itch I wanted to scratch when I played either genre of the game.\n\nTo me, Stellaris fixes that.  Its combination of 4X aspects, along with the grand strategy level diplomacy, management and scale finally scratch that itch for me perfectly.  Yin and yang working in harmony.\n\nDoes the game have a few things that need tweaking? Absolutely.  The AI needs some adjusting to be a bit more involved and logical on its alliance and federation diplomacy, and the races traited towards dominance and war need to be a bit more blood thirsty and aggressive.  For what its worth, we're two days into release and Paradox has already patched minor issues and is listening to the community to address any further tweaks that may be needed.\n\nRegardless, its absolutely worth your money if these types of games are for you.  Having been a customer of Paradox for years now, I am truly excited to how much further they can and will take this game.","May 11","true","115.2"," 204 of 235 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","204","235","5","6"

Sorry, I assume you were asking whether you should get this game? I assume you like 4X (and have a PC that can run it) since you were looking at the reviews and all you need to know on that front is "yes" you should. Stellaris takes Paradox's grand strategy feel into space and does it really well giving you a good deal of customisation of your race including, importantly, ethics that strong influence how you interact with other race (spiritualists don't like materialists and no-one likes a xenophobe). If I were to give it a score (out of 10) personally I'd like to give it a 9 but I can see a strong argument for an 8 based on a few bugs, unfinished features and gameplay plateaus that I am sure Paradox will fix/fill in a timely fashion.\n\nIt's a great game, the only main issues are some bugs (mostly pretty minor so nothing to mention compared to most releases these days) and a fairly passive AI who plays war much more defensively than they could and a mid-game plateau where little of interest happens unless you are playing a very militaristic expansionistic empire. Additionally it is worth noting that the 'revolt' feature - particuarly important to slaves and races dependant on them, has not been implemented due to lack of time. Right now you can enslave away without fear of slave revolts and it is disappointing that this feature was cut froim release even if Paradox do intend to roll it out soon after. These are issue I have faith will be filled based on Paradox's previous titles (faith based on evidence - should have probably used a different word, oh well) and the game itself is still incredibly fun even for these failings.\n\nNow something I have to sing massive praise for Paradox for doing is the accessibility. Stellaris is incredibly easy to get into - there is a small advisor bot (who is helpfully voiced and is even amusing on occasion) who asks how much guidance you want when you start your first game. This alone with the early game 'missions' that walk you through some basic empire growing steps really helps push new players in the right direction. If you have ever had issues getting in Europa Universalis IV or Crusader Kings II you are fully justified - those Paradox games offer no manual, no tutorial, no guidance and are downright obscure at times (apart from Paradox's ever helpful dedication to tooltips which I love) - Stellaris however just works. You can pick Stellaris up and play - no YouTube guides or LPs needed (although you'd be remiss if you didn't watch my excel- ahem, where was I?). Stellaris is likely to be the Paradox gateway drug for players new to their titles.\n\nIf you love 4X or Paradox games, then this is certainly the game for you. Does it have some flaws? Sure, but not too major and ones I do believe will be fixed in the near future. Does it have some bugs? Sure, the lack of upgradeable warp drives on troop transports is particularly egregious. But these are issues that will be gone within the month most likely and Paradox has a long history of supporting their titles with updates, fixes and optional DLC. Get it.\n\n-EE\n\n(p.s. Yes I focus on negatives more than I should with great games but that's because I want them to be perfect so bad!)","May 10","true","128.8"," 208 of 241 people (86%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","86","208","241","14","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pohlse/recommended/281990/","pohlse","pohlse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pohlse/","43 products in account","185+ Hours and 3 full campaigns in and I finally feels like I can review Stellaris objectively.\n\nStellaris is a 4x grand strategy game from Paradox. So I kind of expected a Civilization in space kind of game (Like Galactic Civilization 3) which isn't a bad thing since I love 4x games. But what I got was something different; a 4x, grand strategy, customizable, nearly open-ended RPG. And that is where this game sets itself apart from all others in the 4x field.\n\nCampaign 1 – Since everything was new I tried to chose things familiar; Humans, warp drive, materialist, individualist, etc... While I found myself at odds with the influence and sector mechanics I was able to build a nice little empire with several allies in a federation. Eventually building myself up to a real economic and military power. With the help of my federation friends we were able to stop aggressive neighbors, over-throw a fallen empire and beat back interdimensional invaders. More than once I found myself wishing for more victory conditions, and when I started feeling like it was getting a little stale I pumped out a crap-ton of colony ships to meet the domination victory condition (owning 40% of habitable planets). All in all a good run.\n\nCampaign 2 – Within 5 years I had encountered a Fallen Empire and they hated me from the beginning, instantly declaring war, which I immediately had to surrender. A couple of years later I met ANOTHER Fallen Empire and THEY hated me. I was playing peaceful, scientist, cat people... Maybe everyone was allergic because everyone, even regular empires, kept insulting me, threatening me, and declaring war on me until I was finally curb-stomped into a chunky red paste. What did I learn from my violent and abusive loss? Better influence and sector management techniques.\n\nCampaign 3 – Military Dictatorship using wormhole generators to move. What a difference a little experience makes! Never once during this campaign did I find myself struggling with the influence mechanic and working with the oddities of the sector mechanic have become rather easy. Fallen empires treat me as a child in need of patience, enemies avoided my vast fleets and my economic power was unmatched. When one of my rivals triggered a galactic wide robot uprising, all I needed to do was put all my robot populations to death and outlaw AI. Easy peasy! Later when I stumbled across the robot capital world I invaded with a genetically engineered xeno army, killed all the robots, and had  a beautiful Gaia world all to myself. Of course I had no friends, allies, trading partners, or anything else. Sadly, I started getting a little bored so I again jumped to a domination victory.\n\nCurrently Stellaris is the tale of three games:\n\nEarly game – Brilliantly fun and engaging! Lots of events that change depending on your pre-game choices, lots of 4x fun, and lots of role playing make the early game really enjoyable and re-playable.\n\nMid game – Lots of repetitive management is required with not a lot of new game content occurring. Being a warmonger can certainly spice this part up but that may not be everyone's cup of tea.\n\nLate game – Some very interesting galaxy wide events/disasters occur and the rise and fall of some of your neighbors keeps some interest. However, the lack of more victory conditions does make things drag a bit.\n\nOverall I love, LOVE, this game. Does it need more victory conditions? Yes. Does it need more mid game events? Yes. Does it need better tool tips? Yes. Are wormhole generators the greatest thing ever? Yes!\n\nOne final thing to keep in mind is that the Clarke patch is about to release which will fix a lot of the sector issues and questionable AI decisions. And the future Asimov patch will address the mid game issues. Which means that things are going to keep getting better so I highly recommend this game to everyone.\n\nEdited to Add:\n\nWow! The Clarke patch hit and what a change!\n\nMidway through my fourth campaign and suddenly, after load, the sectors started actually producing, science costs reduced slightly, fighter and bomber groups became wildly effective, federation partners began fighting their own battles (a bit), other empires asked for (and offered) safe passage through their space, diplomatic requests began to pour in, enemy AI combat decisions became much smarter, and all the frontier outposts I had been hiding in sectors to avoid influence costs grabbed me by the scruff of the neck, bent me over a log, and yelled “squeal like a pig!”\n\nWhat a massive improvement!\n\nThe future Asimov patch is still needed for mid game content, but if you were waiting to buy Stellaris, well wait no more. It is even better now.","May 28","true","268.3"," 248 of 295 people (84%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","84","248","295","14","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badratsforever/recommended/281990/","badratsforever","☭MRФWИЭRAИDPWИЭR☭","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badratsforever/","89 products in account","tl;dr: Stellaris in my opinion is a game that has potential but overall feels unfinished.\n\nIt's basically a union of the average 4X and the grand strategy Paradox are so good at. Let's go through it one feature at a time.\n\nThe early game is great. The exploration phase and finding anomalies is beyond promising, there's even questlines for that RPG feel. Most importantly though, it's fleshed out. Anomalies paint a picture that give the galaxy some depth, which is why the early game is so damn good. As for the questlines, they have potential but I have yet to finish one because of lack of border access once I get boxed in. Pirates appeared after I founded my first colony, with an event to come with it. They attacked my colony, I attacked them and destroyed their base, after that Pirates never bothered me ever again. Which was weird.\n\nThe transition to mid-game is nothing short of rough. Suddenly, there's nowhere left in the galaxy to explore because I'm boxed in between two empires that are much stronger than me. I also had to start handing control over to sectors, which is AI that manages colonies so I don't have to micromanage my empire when I have hundreds of them. Don't even get me started on the AI, but the main purpose of sectors is to give rebels who want independence a clear goal, which is to secede an entire sector. Though they can be easily paid off with some bribes.\n\nThe tech tree is alright. It's extensive, I'll give it that. The idea is that every time you finish a tech, you have 3 options. Each time those 3 are semi-random, like drawing from a set of cards. It's a pretty good idea, but it makes it difficult to plan ahead when it's semi-random each time. You also get "Rare" technologies that aren't rare at all. I got an achievement for researching 10 rare techs in one game, being my first game.\n\nThere isn't much to be said about pops or buildings. It's very much like Civilization V where you assign citizens to work certain tiles, but it's in space. Buildings enhance those tiles. But to get better buildings you have to improve your capital building, which requires a certain amount of pops to do so. This means small planets are essentially useless. Mining is straight-forward. You build mining stations or research stations wherever you can. As long as you can balance resources that is.\n\nOf course, there is also Ethics. Ethics are what shapes your empire. Are you peaceful, or warlike? Are you a Xenophile, or a Xenophobe? Are you a Collectivist, or an Individualist? Again, it's a good idea, but it's not done properly. Ethics as a whole feels like it's more about what you can't do that what you can do. It limits the gameplay by letting very specific ethics do specific things. What's that, you found a level 4 anomaly giving you an extremely high tech ship? Oh wait, I'm a Xenophobe, trash it and get some influence (This actually happened to me). Despite being militeristic, I had only one option in that event. I didn't have a choice about what to do witht that ship, which was infuritating. So when you have one ability that requires one ethic, it leaves the rest out in the cold. And with diplomacy, every single empire you meet gives you the same set of responses based on your ethics, which don't mean anything as far as I know, but it's still repetitive. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nNow for the main problem with this game, interacting with other Empires. Everything about it feels unfinished. Midgame overall is a slog, and the barebone diplomacy and lack of internal politics definitely doesn't help. Empires can build alliances with each other. If you have at least 4 members of that alliance you can become what is known as a Federation. No, not Star Trek-style federation. It's just a glorified alliance that gives the leader more say and everyone else even less to do. Trade is almost non-existant. There's no trade routes, and the AI doesn't seem to understand how to accept or decline deals properly.\n\nWarfare is completely broken. At least with AI. You're supposed to fight like your average Space war. Fleets attack fleets, Orbital bombardment, invading planets, etc. But sadly it doesn't work. Enemy AI essentially chases you around which makes it easy to tie up a much larger fleet with a tiny one. Allied AI does the same thing. They follow your largest fleet with their entire force, even if it's twice the size of yours. And while the enemy might leave a few fleets lying around, the allied AI literally uses their entire fleet. Which means that I have to do everything. Broken warfare made me quit my first game, in fact.\n\nAnd at last we come to Late game. So the idea of the Late game is that as you research more and more advanced techs, they become riskier. This culminates in an End game crisis. For example, you can research techs that allow you to build robot pops. And as time goes on, technology allows these pops to become more and more efficient. Eventually though, as you'd expect, the robots become self aware and rebel once they become less of toasters (Stellaris AI) and more as advanced intelligence.\n\nCurrently, there are 3 End game Crisis'.\n1. Robots. They're unstoppable. They outproduce and outresearch everyone. You may be able to fight off their initial revolt, but eventually they will defeat someone and take over their empire, and from there it's a death sentence.\n\n2. Extradimensional invaders known as the Unbidden. These appear if you research and use the Jump Drive, a late game tech. Sadly, it's broken because the Empires' AI don't seem to be aware of the threat and therefore don't unite against them. In fact, they don't fight back at all. The only way to defeat the Unbidden is by destroying the portal they came through.\n\n3. And finally, Extragalactic invaders known as the Prethoryn Swarm. They appear when you do neither of the above. They're pretty much the same as the Unbidden, but instead of a portal, you have to capture their queen to defeat them. They infect planets with their infective...ness and have to be bombarded to cure. Again, the AI are too dumb to understand the threat the Prethoryn pose. And worse yet, the Prethroyn are also dumb, and don't do anything after the initial invasion of a single empire. This is the only one I've experienced so far, so the other two might be the same.\n\nThe End game crisis is a great idea, but again, it isn't executed properly. Which is a shame because it's really set apart from your average 4X in that respect.\n\nAll that being said, there are two things that I absolutely love about this game.\n\nFallen Empires. Fallen Empires are basically remnants from past empires that are completely stagnant, but are much, much, MUCH more advanced, numerous, and overall powerful than everyone else, at least until the Late game. They look down on everyone and each have their own special way of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ them off. Which if you do, you're toast. Overall they add a unique aspect to the balance of power and are indeed pre-established empires, which I think is very cool.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum we have Primitive Civilization. These are pre-FTL species that can range anywhere between Neolithic and Early Space Age. They have many different scenarios and events to spice things up. Like an equivilent to World War 2 for example. Or a nuclear holocaust. And what's more, you can infiltrate their governments to prepare for annexation, or you can technologically uplift them. Or you could just wipe them out if you're feeling especially bloodthirsty today.\n\nBack to the point though. Stellaris was a fun game when I first played it. A little boring, yes. But everything was new. But it was all the game had to offer, sadly. It's likely part of Paradox's DLC plan, but that's beside the point. The game is there, but it needs fleshing out. So if I were you, I'd wait a while for the patches and DLC to come, then I'd consider buying it. But at launch, I wouldn't recommend it.","May 14","false","42.6"," 913 of 1,206 people (76%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","76","913","1","30","34"

But before the review, a small timeline:\n\n6:00 PM: Got home from work, started the download, made some dinner, took a nap (didn't think it would be that small, +1).\n7:30 PM: Started playing. Blinked.\n10:00 PM: After the blink, my sister called and asked for a ride.\n11:00 PM: Resumed playing. Blinked again.\n03:00 AM: Is it midnight yet? I checked the time on my phone and remembered I had to get up at 7AM. With great sadness, I saved the game and turned the computer off.\n09:30 AM: Took a break from work and am now writing this. Can't stop thinking about my empire.\nNow on to the review!\nI seriously can't remember when was the last time I completely lost track of time when playing a game that is so immersive like Stellaris! I think it was when Civ V came out, or maybe Skyrim, but none of those kept me so away from the real world and so focused on what was happening in the game! I seriously loved it! I remember when I first played a 4x space game, I really wanted to like it, but something was missing from it (Distant Worlds). And the same thing happened with all others I tried afterwards. But not Stellaris. This game achieves perfect balance of features, complexity and simplification. It has everything I always wanted on a 4x space game, without any annoyances seen on other games!\n\nSome of the pros:\nExcellent learning curve: Simple at first, gets as complex as you are willing to dig in.\nMicromanagement balance: In the beggining there is a lot, but you have few things to manage, so it's ok (and interesting). Later on, exactly when you start to feel overwhelmed, you learn how to automate planets, by creating sectors).\nInteresting races! Don't be fooled by the small number of species! Each empire you encounter can be a lot different from each other, even if they are of the same major species (avian, reptiles, mammal, etc).\nSuperb writing! Every anomaly finding, every faction conversation, reasearch projects, "quests", and even descriptions are worth reading! Makes me regret not getting the Galaxy edition, because of the e-book.\nGraphics: they are very cool, a lot more detailed than what is usually the standard for 4x games.\nSounds and music: Not once I felt the music was boring or repetitive. Sounds are nice, and not those that get tiring after a while and makes you just want to turn the volume down.\nDifficulty: I think the normal dif setting is perfect for new players. I encountered a religious fanatic empire very early in the game, and they quickly declared themselves rivals of my technocratic empire. A cold war started, and eventually I thought I could overpower them and declared war. It's amazing how balanced our fleets were! I won most battles, but each one of them were really, really close! Eventually they surrendered, right when I was about to give up. Simply amazing.\nCustomization options: There are a lot of possibilities of customizatiom, from your empire details, to the ship designs. I felt like I only scratched the surface of the possibilities.\nProbably more stuff that I don't remember now.\nNow for the cons...\nNo central galactic black hole\nCan't put down\nMakes me feel like none of the other games on my Steam account matters anymore.\nOveral: 10/10. If you're still on the fence with this game, my advice is that you buy it now, you won't regret it!","May 10","true","41.1"," 118 of 133 people (89%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","89","118","133","38","0"

Stellaris was released for Steam on Monday 9th May 2016. The price for this game is £34.99/$39.99. A press review copy was provided for The Hidden Levels.\n\nIt was a groggy morning when I was on steam browsing around for upcoming games to see if any of them caught my attention. I suddenly stumbled across this title ‘Stellaris’ which instantly grabbed me by the font of the text upon a very abstract image. Upon closer inspection my cravings and demands for a space exploration game suddenly peaked as soon as my eyes browsed the pictures and videos behind Stellaris.\n\nI have never before been interested in tactical space games, this was all new to me. Just like the whole idea behind the game. Starting on a planet and then exploring space. The fear of the unknown, the fear of not knowing what is next. I was very scared because I am new to the whole Space Genre and 4X. Before I knew it, twenty hours had passed on this game. Here is what I liked and disliked about the game.\n\nWhat I liked:\nGuided hand  – The tutorial on this game comes in three options. Full, tips and none. I am so grateful for the fact that this tutorial really does help, without it I would’ve still been left swimming with the fishes. It’s completely voiced over by an AI robot (Your assistant) who is eager to help you with every menu click and move you make. Once you feel you know the ropes of the game you can happily turn him off in menu and he will disappear into the void.\n\nShoot me to space  – The graphics of this game, the universe are indeed beautiful to look at. From the Sun in the centre of the solar system to the swirling dust clouds on the surface of each planet, I want to be instantly shot into space to the beautiful colors that surround me. Some systems which you explore have Black Holes, Yellow Dwarves and other vortexes which are really stunning to look at.\n\nLively Galaxy  – With a Galaxy size ranging from 100 stars to 1000 stars and with up to 39 AI Empires, the whole galaxy really feels alive and the game suddenly becomes life with the amount of interaction and size. I have yet to scratch the surface of a 1000 star scenario and I’ve been playing for around 15 hours on that one save.\n\nCustomisation  – The customisation for each empire is crazy. From the character portraits to their traits, names, visions and planet names you can really have a heavily customised empire. You can also go and edit the preset empires to slightly change them too.\n\nM and Ms  – The magic m’s are definitely on this game. Multiplayer is a really really good experience. It plays very similar to single player, the only difference is that only the host can pause and move the time. A really great super feature is that you can also save games online and then come back to them later. The other magic M is mod support, the game has extensive support for mods and they said “every aspect of the game is moddable”.\n\nWhere did my day go? – I swear it was only an hour. At least it felt that. Before you know it, your day has disappeared. The game has a special talent of taking away that time you have.\n\nWhat I disliked:\nMaybe just a week of playing  – The fact time flies when playing this game means you will need a lot of spare time. This game requires a lot of time investment and could easily cost you your job or family. Okay... maybe not that bad... but it still does suck your life away.\n\nEasy?  – There is no easy difficulty on the game. Just Normal and upwards. For newbies to the genre like me starting from normal is almost suicidal. Even with 20+ hours invested in the game I have not got to a point yet of seeing if I can actually take over the AI so I cannot comment so much on that but I believe they won’t be a push over. The several jousts me and the AI have had with the combat had ended in me losing mostly although it was not by much and pretty fair.\n\nSettings and sliders  – The settings in the game are pretty minimum and there are in fact no graphic settings. I would’ve loved to have options for low, medium, high and ultra but the game seems to have only one setting. The game still runs fine for me however but I believe people who have a lower specified computer will have more issues trying to play the game with no options of lowering quality for playability. Which brings me on to my next point.\n\n1000 stars and max empires  – With the maximum stars and 36 empires all playing in one game, the game gets slightly jumpy. The game remains playable however and is still enjoyable. I won’t talk too much about my specifications or in detail but it’s an average PC. (2GB VRAM) and according to the steam stats page it’s better than half the peoples PC’s out there. I know it’s not the best and you can get much better but for the people who may not have that then the game falls into a grey area for running bigger scenarios.\n\nCampaign or Story Mode  – I feel a story mode or scenarios which puts you into situations like being outnumbered or two massive Alliances with a back story fighting each other would’ve been really good. The game does have some story in the situation log however but I feel a more dedicated story mode would’ve been perfect for this game.\n\nI came into Stellaris as a novice and was very scared of being unable to handle it. I was delighted however to be able to easily grasp the basics and progress to a point where I did not want to sleep and continue playing all night long. I played a single player game and a multiplayer game in the time I spent playing Stellaris and even though I spent a chunk of time playing the game I did not progress too much into a point of conquering enemies. In fact I only went to war with one of the thirty seven nations and only made contact with 8 in the whole time of me playing the single player game.\n\nThe game is real fun and addictive however, so much that I highly recommend it to all my friends, family and viewers. Paradox have really blown my mind with this game and how much I can get lost in the galaxy and far beyond. I would avoid this game however if you wanted to spare your life... but then again... go for it! It’s definitely worth experiencing and I highly recommend this game.","May 9","true","22.3"," 490 of 690 people (71%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","71","490","690","24","30"

I feel I could say farewell to my Pirate gaming days and be a legal and good gamer with respect.\n\nThus I bought Stellaris on launch day, with full pirce, as the first such try in my gaming experience with Paradox.\n\nI played it as crazy, till 40 hours later when a strong feeling of being fooled stormed my mind.\n\nThis game, as in its current status, though with best graphics in Paradox games, is only skeleton, fleshless and souless.\n\nI only state one of its many problems: lack of content.\n\nThe early game could be fun, meaning you explore and expand and plan cautiously. Yet after a certain point, there's nothing left to do except repeatitive micro management.\n\nThere is no advanced development, since you can only manage 5 to 7 stars and building types are quite limited.\n\nThere is no advanced governance, since most of your empire has to be governed by "Sectors", but you only have minimum interactions with them, like energy focus and mineral focus. Plus their AI is dumb as hell.\n\nThere is no intense fighting, since: 1. Corvette is extremly OP, you don't really need bigger ships. 2. Formation, Tactics, Strategy, Supply Lines,Morale and meaningful Defence Facilities don't exist. 3. Combat AI doesn't exist as well. The only model of war is : Chase your enemy all around the map (due to no supply lines and real defence or chokepoint)- Grind them automatically(no tactics, formation, morale)- Land troops on their planet, repeat. After your doomstack finishes their doomstack, war is in fact over. No rebuilding a proper fleet, no guerrilla tactics, no desperate defence of their home planet, nothing.\n\nThre is no politics, since the only functional factions are only separatists and you can easily crack down their hopless revolt by adding more cheap garrisons. No cry for the change of government, no pursuit for another religion, no independence desire from sectors, nothing.\n\nThere is no trade, literally. No you can't ship extra food from one planet to another, you can't build markets or trading posts, let alone trade routes, you don't have any ethics or government types with anything raleted to the concept of TRADE.\n\nThere is no espionage, literally. No spy, no steal tech, no incite revolt, no support independence, nothing.\n\nThere is no advanced diplomacy, since only really functional options are war and alliance-federation(without it there's almost no way for fleet access and tech co-operation ), while the later is unfinished and bugged. You want crisis system in Vic 2? H.R.E system in EU 3/4? Feudal relationships in CK2? Sorry but you must be dreaming. Yes there are some end game crisises, like the Mongol invasion in CK2. But in this universe, no one really cares.\n\nAnd above is only my incomplete conclusion of one of major problems of this game.\n\nI know Paradox fanboys would argue: "It's just normal for Paradox's game on release status. Paradox will gradually patch the game and add more and more contents to it over time."\n\nBut the issue is they made a shallow beta with just too few features and contents and sell it as if it's finished. Then, maybe 1 or 2 years later, after several Overprieced DLC milking.  We, as their free QA employees, will finally get the "FULL GAME" after paying maybe 100 or 200 bucks, with tears and gratitude.\n\nI have admired the ambition of Stellaris and looked foward to promises made by Paradox. I have tried to understand and tolerate the DLC milking practice made by Paradox, since its base games at least seem finished and are even with some suprisingly good features. Sadly, It seems it's a new routine for devs to release unfinished games with full pirce and charge players for so called "DLCs" which are actully cut-off contents of base game. Paradox is just one of them.\n\nSuddenly I feel guilty of buying a full priced legal game for the first time, not for the loss of 40 bucks, but for my openly contirbution to the suicidal greed of a once wonderful game developer.","May 26","false","77.7"," 504 of 715 people (70%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","70","504","715","25","36"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/281990/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","Paradox serve up the canvas upon which great stories will be told, and upon which the future of all Science Fiction 4x games must be judged.\nSo. Stellaris. I think it's safe to say Paradox just dropped a nuclear bomb on the genre. It's not perfect by any means, there are elements of the UI that are in need of polishing, there's AI bugs that need fixing, and there's victory conditions that are missing (diplomacy and science victories of some flavour would be nice, just saying). But what's here entirely changes how you must view the science fiction 4x and strategy genre, in effect, there is pre-Stellaris games, and there is post-Stellaris games. From this point on, everything now must be judged by this benchmark, and if it does not improve on, or innovate from where Stellaris has set the conversation now, then it must be discarded.\n\nIn truth I feel sorry for some developers, Stardrive 2 for instance has now been rendered obsolete, because it is effectively a smaller version of Stellaris, it has a subset of the features that Stellaris brings to the table, except everything that Stardrive and Stardrive 2 did, Stellaris does it significantly more adeptly. Ditto for Wargaming, they must have thought the Master of Orion license was a good idea at the time, and that cranking out a merely competent 4X would have been enough to rake in the money. Now? They're going to be feeling more than a little silly.\n\nStellaris is the lesson from which every developer must learn from, it is the new starting point from which any 4X developer must take heed\nIn a radical departure from Paradox's traditional Grand Strategy fare, they've wedded 4X to their strengths, and they've created a hybrid, something that begins as a 4X with some grand strategy trappings, and gently evolves into a progressively larger creature over the course of your empire, but all the while keeping those 4X elements in play, so that the game feels fresh and accessible. This is easily the most "readable" Paradox strategy game to date, and for people who have had trouble getting into things like Crusader Kings 2, this is a fine place to start.\n\nIn another major change, due to the fact you're playing a fledgling race that has just joined the era of space exploration, you are not joining a pre-generated world full of empires that are developed and settled down. Whilst I imagine that some enterprising modders are going to create such games where empires are already "bedded in" and you can select your empire from a list to define what kind of experience you have, here you start as a tabula rasa, and your choices right from race creation inform the kind of experience you will have over the course of the game.\n\nWhether you will be dealing in diplomacy or warfare, whether science or faith is your guiding light, whether you welcome alien races with open arms or a guarded response. The game shapes itself and its narrative around your choices and considerations, meaning that there is a ludicrous level of replayability, not to mention the randomly drawn stories that can occur within your playthroughs. This is a game where no two playthroughs will ever be remotely the same, and where a single playthrough will have moments memorable enough that two Stellaris players will be able to share "war stories" that whilst incredibly different, will have both of them finding common ground in the way the game has brought people together.\n\nShip building too, whilst initially simplistic looking at the Corvette level, quickly blossoms into a varied and wonderful thing where Cruisers and Destroyers are assembled from a jigsaw of pieces and module components to create multiple designs which fit your needs as and when you need them. Weapon types start off with "obvious enough" but research can take you down some very unexpected directions if you're lucky.\n\nScience advantages aren't quite as obvious as they seem, thanks to some clever design\nResearch itself is presented in such a way that it draws cards from a deck, a deck constructed from researches that you've gained the pre-requisites to unlock, but you'll only be able to draw so many from at a given time. This means you can "hazily" guide research if you stick down certain branches, but you'll have to improvise and adjust your short term goals from time to time. It's a clever system, rewarding races who take the option of extra research picks by allowing them to not research "faster" but research "smarter", whilst at the same time keeping the field fairly level and preventing any one person from overspecialising down a single path to attempt to brute force a technological advantage.\n\nThis doesn't even touch upon mid-game diplomacy and federations, where the shifting nature of alliances means that you'll need to cultivate friendships by establishing diplomacies, and with clever use of insults and gifts, you can set up wars which work out in your favour, even forcing foes who were at one time implacably hostile to change their world view and eventually capitulate and become new allies after recognising the error of their ways. It's incredible stuff.\n\nFinal thoughts\nStellaris is not just a game that's mandatory for any fan of Sci-fi 4x. It's mandatory for any prospective developer of Sci-fi 4x too, because if you intend to compete in this field, this is what you need to stand up against. Paradox haven't just stormed the field, they've entirely redefined it. From this point forth, this is what you will be judged against, and woe betide you if you come up short.\n\nIf Paradox follow through on their intent for long term DLC for Stellaris, they could quite easily suffocate the market in this genre, a feat not achieved since World of Warcraft sucked out the oxygen from the paid subscription MMO market.\n\nVerdict : Essential, and consider this the marker to be put up against in future if you're a sci-fi 4x","May 14","true","32.5"," 227 of 315 people (72%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","72","227","315","9","16"

It's the kind of game you want to love, but just can't.\n\nThe game is well set up, providing a really nice set of mechanics. When you start the game and try it out, it seems great - it has research, it has exploration, space anomalies with interesting texts, even quest chains of sort (even though it's basically always "go to system and reserach there". You have factions and different species with changing ethics. Hence why the initial reviews here are very positive.\n\nProblem is that once you've played your first 5 hours and surveyed your first 50 systems, there's suddenly nothing left to do. Enemy empires are passive to say the least, they just squat in their corner of space and ignore you. Resources management is fun at first when you're lacking minerals or energy and need to build new facilities on your worlds and juggle population between them. Alas, as your empire grows, price of development doesn't scale with income, so at some point you stop bothering, since it doesn't really matter if you build a new mine or not, there's nothing to put your resources into anyway (except spamming battleships you don't really need). Colonization loses its appeal, since to colonize new planets, you need to automate some you already have. Factions never do anything. Ethics don't matter.\n\nSo at some point instead of "one more turn", you catch yourself asking "why am I even still playing?". And at that point you quit and realize you feel no urge to start playing again.\n\nI'm dearly hoping for some tweaking that would add some internal and external challanges and would get me busy managing my empire again. Maybe a patch, maybe a datadisk - while I'll be more skeptic, I'm going to buy it if I see good feedback on game websites. I really really want this game to be good. But so far, it isn't.","May 15","false","9.7"," 326 of 465 people (70%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","70","326","465","11","7"

Oh man, it was ridiculously addictive, and deep! Playing for just 2 hours I ran into all kinds of anomalies while exploring the galaxy, making the task of sending a ship to explore unknown stars feel like an episode of Star Treks. From space whales to long lost civilizations. And we haven't even got to other factions yet.\n\nIn short, think MoO2, but with all the goodies you expected from Paradox grand strategy game. Each government has its own unique mechanics, each ship is commanded by a captain that has attributes (a la CK2 lite), hell even your goverment is run by a politician who also has attributes and gained experiences, Each planet has pops that works factories or labs, and these pops would also influence how your government is run. Hell, This game is basically the culmination of Paradox grand strategy games, and a very refined one at that.\n\nI'd write more, but I need to get back to my empire.

If I know Paradox (and I think I do) there are many, many more hours of entertainment to be had because of the dynamically generated gameplay, where every universe you create is unique.\n\nIn my opinion, Stellaris brings a much needed breath of fresh air to an otherwise stagnated 4X strategy genre, where almost every game is in part inspired by either Civilization or the Master of Orion series. It’s done with a finish rarely seen outside of big budget, big studio productions – with a very small team. Stellaris has an excellent combination of freedom of design and deep political system that we don’t see nearly enough of in my opinion.\n\nThe pace of the game is great for the most part, starting out with a complete hands on control of the empire early on, while slowly handing off more and more power to local governors that can administrate entire regions of systems for you, in exchange for more autonomy and a reduced tax rate. Your neighbors react in a very realistic manner to your world views – which can very easily lead to war. I can say from personal experience that being pro-slavery is not easy when you’re surrounded by pacifist hippies – who suddenly seem less interested in peace, and much more focused on plotting your inevitable demise and raising war fleets to accomplish that.\n\nI’ve really enjoyed my time with Stellaris, and I’m sure I’ll be having many more late nights of playing it over the coming years. I have minor gripes with how automation of ships work (or the lack thereof), where I definitely think it should have been an option. Information about mechanics and choices is also a little on the light side at times. With all of that in mind, I’ve come to a final score for Stellaris of 9 (and a half...appendage). It falls just shy of a full 10 at current, but knowing Paradox’s DLC model, they will easily make it there in time…and maybe more."","May 9","true","97.0"," 147 of 197 people (75%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","75","147","197","9","1"

After all, it worked for Crusader Kings 2.  That's not sarcasm, by the way.\n\nSeriously, it did work for CK2.  That's an awesome game and I've sunk far more time & money into it than I'd care to admit.  All that extra stuff has left me spoiled - I admit it - and nothing else than having that level of depth & complexity does it for me anymore.  Which I'm sure is exactly the way Paradox wanted it.  Their DLC model is perfectly addictive and it works.  The simple stuff is cheap, the deeper stuff costs a bit more, and you're never having your arm twisted to buy more than you want.\n\nBut I also know that if I ever booted it up today with all those mods and all that DLC turned off I'd fall asleep on my own keyboard in fifteen minutes.  Like with any other addiction, you build up a tolerance.  You need that bigger dose to get anything out of it.  Which is fine once you've already got all that stuff.\n\nStellaris, on the other hand, doesn't have all that other stuff yet.  Don't believe me?  Think about their espionage system.  Oh, that's right, there isn't any.  Kind of odd that would be completely missing in a modern x4 game, isn't it?  Can you think of any other games in the x4 genre to come out in the last decade that doesn't have spies in any form?\n\nYet here we are, completely lacking one, and why do you think that is?  Because it's going to be added latter.  Along side everything else that is so obviously missing.  After all, you can only pretend to be exicted about discovering the exact same four alien species (gas grazers, crystals, etc) so many times.  Anomalies may be interesting the first time you see them, but come back in a month and see if you actually stop to read any of those info-blurbs.  You won't, because you've read them all fifty times already & now it's dull.  In fact, once that initial "new game" buzz wears off everything is going to feel dull real quick.\n\nWhich is exactly what they want, because that's when the DLC train is going to start rolling in with twenty boxcars behind it.  Slowly but surely, dollar by dollar, Stellaris will indeed evolve into one of the greatest x4 space opera games ever made.  It may end up taking five years and costing you two hundred bucks, but as someone who's already been there with CK2, I can assure you that somehow it will feel worth it.  Seriously, it will.  And I have no problem with that.  It's a good system - it works.  I applaud their marketing technique.  It is brilliant.\n\nAll I am saying is that right now is not the time to jump onto the Stellaris bandwagon.  Give it a little while and the patches will roll in, the price will come down, and the first DLCs will come out to start filling all the glaring empty spaces in the current game design.\n\nIn short, come back in a year and I'm certain this review will be a very happy thumbs up.  But until then it's probably best to not pick up the habit until there's actually more out there to feed the addiction, otherwise you'll be left wanting.","May 20","false","1.7"," 928 of 1,398 people (66%) found this review helpful 69 people found this review funny","66","928","1","69","122"

The game is an ostensible fusion of Grand Strategy and 4X, featuring massive scale, intragovernmental management, POPs, strategic resources, government types, etc. While it has the makings of the 4Xs and a smattering of strategy, it fails in both regards. I cannot recommend it in its present state.\n\nThe game utterly lacks any deep systems outside of population management; there is no intergalactic economy to speak of, no trade routes, no logistical considerations for war (no fuel or ammunition), very limited options when declaring war (you can only conquer/liberate/vassalize planets/systems/empires, respectively; you cannot enforce government types, abduct citizens, execute leaders, or claim unsettled systems), very little in the way of planetary management (the sector system ensures that you'll rarely hold any more than 10 planets in a given game, whereas the galaxy can contain several hundred; on top of that, it's basically a similar version of GalCiv2's planet management screen with clunkier automation - you develop tiles and place people on them, that's it), very little control over research, and no espionage. You do a lot of clicking to affect little direct change.\n\nThe leader system, where you can recruit extraordinary citizens from available populations in your empire, boils down to nothing more than a bunch of timed, growable modifiers. Leaders have no personality whatsoever. They do not trigger trait-specific events, and they have no effect on interactions with other empires unless they have traits that do. There are no feuds between two God-Emperors, no presidents detested by embittered rival empires, no events dealing with leaders of other empires, or anything of the sort. Contrast with CK2, where the characters of your leaders vastly affects the composition of your realm, even in vanilla.\n\nWhat depth there is remains inconsequential in most playthroughs. It's not like CK2, where you have to learn the ins-and-outs of managing vassals to have a shot at governing a large empire. I completely neglected my POPs beyond throwing down a few happiness buildings and paying off factions, and yet I've still yet to have one rebellion break out across multiple games, even when I've integrated fairly large, unhappy populations. I haven't even bothered with gene modifiation since I'm doing just fine without that kind of expensive, time-consuming optimization.\n\nEverywhere you look, it feels like something is missing. Interactions with other empires boils down to conquering them or allying with them and conqering them later. POPs management consists of spamming certain resources when factions get unruly and colonizing certain planets with certain species. War is a rock/paper/scissors spam-off where corvettes dominate the meta. Dealing with primitives involves picking one of four options and waiting, or just invading them like you would an AI - except it's even easier. Research consists of crossing your fingers and waiting for the game to generate the techs you want. Managing planets stays the same all throughout the game since anything beyond your first few get relegated to self-governing, inefficient sectors. There's just nothing worth engaging with, mechanically. Even exploration, the best-executed feature in the game, becomes worthless once you're either boxed in or you've already gathered data on other systems via map exchanges in a buggy, antiquated trading interface.\n\nBuy something like Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion instead. At least that game has compelling combat.","May 15","false","34.9"," 292 of 445 people (66%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","66","292","445","9","9"

I enjoy the game, and if you look at my history with Paradox games, i generally love them (800hours on Vic2 600 odd hours on CK2 and about 400 on EUIV)\n\nHowever, this game is SEVERLEY lacking depth. The diplomacy which is primarily the reason i play paradox games as opposed to Total War is almost non existant. There is no trading mechanic whatsoever. And it generally feels incomplete as a game, and you ultimately seem ot be doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nYet, this is where i have the problem with saying i dont reccommend the game.\n\nIt is fun for the first few hours, and i do want to continue to play it, but im now playing a bit at a time and being bored because it is the same thing over and over again... explore this star system, investigate this anomaly...its great while youre exploring and understnding everything, but then its just the same thing over and over again.\n\nAnd then you begin to see just how shallow this is as a game, it really does feel like Paradox are using this as a vechle to sell DLC, which normally i dont have a problem with their DLC policy, but this game does lack such depth it does lead me to think that they have stripped it of features in order to add them back in at a later date at a cost.\n\nSo, yeah this game WILL be very good, and im very excited for the next 12 months of this games development, but perhaps if youre cash strapped, wait for a sale.

It's smooth, elegant, sounds great, looks great, and is stable.\nThis is no trivial game that you can master, finish and discard in a couple dozen hours.\nI imagine this is a game I will continue playing for months, if not years, especially as new content is released. Stellaris is a STRATEGY game, and makes no bones about it, as there is barely even a nod towards tactical elements.\n\nThe one thing I love about Stellaris above most other games in this genre .... there are actual STAR SYSTEMS, not just planets floating in space or arbitrary placeholders. Ships which warp or jump into a system have to traverse the system or wait for their jump drives to cool down before they can jump again. As an immersive factor, this WORKS for me.\n\nThe nature of the game is TOTALLY suited to modding and customisation. I can imagine people designing the entire star wars galaxy or star trek galaxy or empire of man or warhammer 40k universe or starcraft universe in this. I literally cannot wait to see what modders will do in terms of race design, 3d models, static galaxy designs, story driven gameplay, event chains, etc.\n\nStellaris has given a massive POKE IN THE EYE to those who think 4x games cannot encompass multiple stardrive types and should be simplified to managing hyperlane bottlenecks.\n\n\nYou will love it if\n- you like sandbox games\n- you want control of customisation\n- you want to set your own goals, and drive your own agenda\n- you love science fiction stories, as the anomalies and events in the game are like a story unfolding, absolutely amazing.\n\nYou will hate it if\n- you are a twitch gamer wanting a rail-shooter in space\n- you want the game to drive the agenda for you\n- you just wanna kill things and couldn't be bothered to read.\n\nBeing a sandbox, i imagine it will suit the multiplayer environment much better than the single player environment, but it is still an awesome single player experience.\n\n\nThere are a few things missing, but they detract very little from the game experience.\n- there are only randomly generated games, no campaign modes\n- there are no freighters, passenger ships, trade routes, etc.\n- the game is pseudo 3d, and effectively plays out on a flat galaxy map\n- no tactical combat mode, but its well done, with combat seamlessly playing outin real time on the strategic map.\n- current diplomacy is not that complex, no espionage, sabotage, etc. But the sheer number of species and diversity adds its own complexity.\n- being a sandbox, there is currently no campaign, but I am sure the modding community will solve this.\n- while there are leaders (governals, admirals, scientists, etc) with traits, experience and skills, they are randomly generated, not a result of a complex relationship engine as in CK2. Not a big deal to me, but I imagine some would have hoped for this. I can imagne a system like rome total war with governing families leading factions might have worked.\n\n\nMany of the tricks the designers missed in the realease version, I imagine can be added in future content, or through modding.","May 10","true","192.2"," 51 of 63 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","51","63","0","0"

A lot of Paradox fanboy's are giving this a lot of hype (as other steam reviews will demonstrate), but i don't actually feel this game deserves that much praise. where to start\n\nGOOD\n-Customization is wonderful, it is just awesome\n-The initial gameplay of explore, colonize, research, fight small skirmishes, and all the other typical 4x systems work enough to make you feel excited and keep you occupied at the beggining of the game.\n-it good to be able to micro manage planets and not make it feel like a boring chore *cough* CK2 casltes *cough*\n-the way you research is actually fun and engaging\n-micro managing fleets, fleet armanents and building defensive structures can actually be really fun.\n-MULTIPLAYER IS AWESOME, JUST STELLAR\n\nBAD\n-diplomacy....what the hell happened to diplomacy??? green and red opinion modifiers are nothing new, but there is no feeling that these other species are alive. its all about getting that trade bar at "1 green" when trading and that is all that matters with AI. at least with EU4 and CK2 i felt that there were some "people" behind the decisions and not just a literal green modifier that forces them to accept no matter what.\n-forming alliances and federations is a hassle since the alliance has to approve wars (you can't go solo when in an alliance) and federations change presidents, causing the AI to take control and do something stupid. federations can also overlap with some species, meaning if i attack species "x" in federation "x" with species "Y" who also happens to be a different federation called "Y" then it calls both federations Y and X into the war even though i am not declaring on species Y. I don't know if this is a bug, but its dumb ethier way.\n-battles are non interactive and you can barely see all those minor improvements you painstakingly updgraded and researched for your fleets.\n-science ships and construction ships become a hassle in the late game since you have to manually control them, take a lesson from Civilzation and add an explore or auto build button.\n-planets become a hassle as you get to the late game, making it clear the UI was clearly not designed for super late game.\n-wars take way to long at the late game, i have spent 30 years sieging half this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s planets and destorying his fleets. but he won't surrender because there is no war exhaustion system, at least i don't believe so.\n\nto sum it up. early game-mid game are quite fun, but late game is a micro managing hell that the UI was not designed for, wars are not that interesting due to how stale the battles are, and diplomacy is boring. However, all these problems (not the UI one, but i can live with that) are fixed by the stellar mulitplayer and that was what this game was really designed for considering how Paradox marketed it for. hell the first button on the home screen is multiplayer and not single player. i just wish more time and energy went to the UI and single player.","May 11","true","18.6"," 49 of 60 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","49","60","3","0"

I'm used to the foibles and nuances of their games, as well as their development process.\n\nI found the game very fun as is. There are some weaknesses, but nothing that prevents me from enjoying the game. It's not perfect, but it has enough depth, novelty, as well as modding support to sink countless hours into the game. However, I also know that Paradox is in it for the long haul. They will continue to flesh out and develop their games for years. I endorse their games knowing that they will only get better with time, and they aren't afraid to overhaul major game mechanics if they aren't quite right, almost all for free. It's a unique style of development, more like an MMO.\n\nIf you just want a perfect experience right now, play the game and just forget about it, then this may not be the game for you, yet. You can wait and get a more evolved version of the game later. As for me, I will enjoy the richness of the current experience, and watch as the community and developer together explore and evolve a fantastic and unique game.","May 21","true","127.4"," 73 of 99 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","73","99","2","0"

Yeah, that works. *nods*\n\nLike Europa Universalis 4, Stellaris is a grand strategy 4X game: explore, expand, exploit, exterminate. Unlike EU4, if you've never played this type of game before you probably won't need a bottle of wine, 2 spa days, and vacation to relax after trying to learn it. (Okay, I exaggerate and confess I only needed a couple of glasses of wine and one long weekend to recover from my first (delighted, dazed, and confused) hours in EU4.)\n\nGrand strategy indeed; you will be exploring space, managing resources and influence, keeping your people happy, colonizing and building, deciding ethical matters, terraforming, pushing the boundaries of science, making or breaking alliances, building ships and armies, waging wars or trying not to, and spreading your own special brand of All The Things across the glittering universe.\n\nHowever....you've probably already heard, "Stellaris is accessible". Yes, it is! The tutorial behaves like a proper host and shows you around the place with kindness and interesting explanations and a welcoming attitude. The game starts slow and easy; you'll have lots of time to click on buttons, read well written explanations, and poke around the place. The learning curve meanders gently into the game and gives you lots of time to breathe and don't worry be happy. And little flashy bits up top warn you of the things you really need to pay attention to anyway.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nThen of course, being a Paradox Interactive grand strategy game you will land on your backside (repeatedly I expect) with a resounding thump, be surprised by things you didn't seen coming, delighted with new lore that hadn't come up before, and stunned by the variety of ways in which you can get it wrong, get it right, win all the things today, or go out in high drama and ranging storms tomorrow.\n\nAs you expand and there are endless details to take care of you create 'sectors' and tuck some things aside to manage themselves (under your orders) and supply you with lootz while you make friends and influence people and wage war in the neighborhood. But, if you just love micromanaging all the things, you can do that too.\n\nAnd then there is modding; this game is as customizable as you want to deal with. Off to the Workshop with you!\n\nIf you like space games this is my favorite of the last 20 years (I was addicted to Sierra's Outpost back in the olden days, bugs and all).\n\nIf you like character creation, this alone could be worth buying the game. Seriously, it's awesome fun! :D\n\nIf you love EU4 (or are terrified of it but secretly always wanted to try) you're going to love Stellaris.\n\nIf you've never considered playing grand strategy 4X games Stellaris may be the open door, with the welcoming host, that changes your gaming life forever.\n\nNow, gotta run, I have a new colony to get sorted. Have fun!\n\n#makespaceprettyagain\n\nEdited: PS. Shoulda said, I'll let you know if I find something about it I don't like.

Another hour of looking at all the options and stuff, before un pausing the game. As well as only un pausing it every so often to make decisions and or check status of my first contacts etc.\n\nShows me one thing about this game, and that is.... I absolutly love it.\n\nI know it's the early game, but this game has everything I personally love, space, ships, exploration, Oh crap moments, some neat stories that pop up. The first contact page popped up and I thought the enimies were at earth, I about freaked out, getting my small weak fleet ready. To then find out they were a few galaxies away, and I had some time to prepare and check them out.\n\nI will admit I am a sucker for space games, especially ones where I can rule the galaxy, and have control over it, all while role playing. This game is neat cause instead of me role-playing a single character, I get to role-play a whole species, which for the first run is human. I will admit it's a hard task to role-play us humans and try to do what I believe we would do in this situation, but I am up for the task.\n\nThe game is running great for me at the moment, I am one of the lucky ones not affected by the studdering bug (hope they fix it for those who are). I like the way the galaxy is set up, as well as the animations of your ships while they do there tasks. The map seems easy enough to understand, and the ability to find stuff seems painless. The UI is ok in the game, I do wish you could scale it, without having to adjust numbers in the game files. Playing on a large screen TV or at high resolution can make you squint a bit.\n\nThe designes of the ships and aliens in the game are awsome, and the fact that the aliens are random is another nice touch. The first contact I made with are basically ameba's, and they really don't look friendly lol. The ship designes I have seen in vids are great, the one where the ship is alive, reminds me of farscape.\n\nEven though I am early in my playthrough my first impressions of the game are good, for me personally it is what I had hoped it would be. I do realise that late game changes things up a bit, and the game slows down, but I imagine they will add DLC to make the end game more complex. It don't hurt that I am running the largest galaxy possible, with as many species as possible. The fact that it took me 3 hours to make my government and another hour just looking at options, I won't be getting to end game for awhile lol.\n\n9/10","May 9","true","22.4"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","36","41","2","2"

The level of detail and intricacy is staggering. I love eerything I've seen in my first session, from the way the galactic map shows your influence growing to the way every single thing can be renamed and tweaked to your liking. Did I immediately create my own civilization based on Freespace? Yes, yes I did.\n\nThe only cons I've experienced so far are that your science ships will immediately run from hostile fleets, you can't just hide them on the other side of the system until the enemy warps off. That and the choose your own adventure style of research isn't really my thing, but that's more a personal preference.\n\nCan't recommended enough to someone looking for a space themed 4X game.","May 9","true","102.0"," 48 of 61 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","48","61","3","4"

I got my money's worth, but the game is broken in its current state, and I'm done playing it for now. I'll change my review if these issues are addressed.\n\n-Huge chunks of features (for example, "respect tile resources" under the sector management) are completely broken and do nothing. I won't even begin to list them all, but...\n\n-The whole factions and rebellions system is completely dead on arrival. Slaves can't revolt, because they haven't fleshed out the design for how slavery revolts will work yet (or so we are told). So, is there a faction you don't like? Just enslave their pops.\n\n-The AI ignores deadly late-game crises that become unstoppable when they are not dealt with quickly, and would probably be way too incompetent to handle them even if they didn't ignore them. If these crises don't happen in your corner of the galaxy you'd better vassalize a path to the crisis, because basic diplomatic needs like military access are impossible without war.\n\n-Speaking of which, the vassalization mechanic is completely broken - any empire can be vassalized with 60% warscore, which makes conquering the galaxy comically easy.\n\n-AI neightbors usually just sit around and act passive. Some expand more than others, but with the exception of fanatical purifies (who will attack), nothing interesting really happens throughout the course of a game and you will choose who to attack on your terms. The early game is interesting the first time you play it; after that, not so much compared to Civ, EU4, DW, pick your game.\n\n-The only way to "win" is through conquest of the galaxy, no diplomatic, scientific means, etc.\n\n-Once you colonize more than 5-7 planets, the rest will go into sectors which are AI-governened. Unfortunately, the sector management AI is completely incompetent. It builds and then immediately razes farms some times, and other times sits on huge stockpiles of resources and doesn't build anything while your pops sit there severely underproducing because they are working a tile without buildings.\n\n-The above problem wouldn't be so bad except as you get to Hard or Impossible difficulty. Your technology cost scales to your population - so for example a large empire has +900% tech cost - so these suboptimized sectors are a huge technology liability. Hard and Impossible difficulties give artificial (50% and 100%) bonuses to all resources, including research, so sectors become a huge technological liability, and in order to keep research parity on hard you willl micromanage every planet.\n\n-After they fix the most glaring problems, the random events, crystalline alien lifeforms, etc. are extremely fun on the first playthrough, but quickly become repetitive.","May 16","false","126.3"," 102 of 150 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","102","150","2","2"

In Stellaris, however, you simply are told that your ally is saying no, without providing any hint on the reasons why he is doing so.\n\nI have also encountered several serious bugs in the game.\n\nI assume that Paradox (the publisher and developer) will continue to develop the game and improve it significantly, as it has done with EU4.

However, reading the community reviews here one would think that it is the "promised game"  of the strategy genre, some people describing it as the "best strategy game" and such. This surprises me. In my experience, Stellaris is a fairly bland game that doesn't bring much (or maybe even  anything) new to the table. Its definitely playable and even enjoyable, but it gets boring and tedious fairly quickly. I wouldn't know if it has a lot of depth, as others often claim about it. It certainly has a lot of "breadth" though, in form of modifiers that affect all kinds of stuff as well as small micromanagement minigames. One needs to learn all that stuff in order to be successful. At the same time, the sole purpose the minigames seems to keep the player occupied.\n\nTake for instance the planet management. Its still the basic old assign-props-to-tiles-and-build-improvements minigame we know from many games before, made slightly more 'complex' by adjacency bonuses. Yes, it gives the player something to do and it seems to offer a 'choice' — but this choice is merely an illusion. In the end, optimal tile development is a linear optimisation problem (what gamers often refer to as min-maxing), an additional puzzle game within the larger game where the player is rewarded by playing the puzzle well and punished by playing it badly. I never understood why I have to play puzzle games of this sort when I want to play a 4X strategy game. Now, while Stellaris generally is quite micromanagement-heavy (planetary survey being one of other annoying things), it also attempts to cut down on micromanagement by introducing sectors, which are basically "AI" assistants that take over management of planetary systems. However, they do it spectacularly badly. The funny thing is that the planet development minigame can be solved by the computer optimally. This is not a particularly difficult problem and algorithms to solve it have existed for decades. Not within the Stellaris universe apparently. Other things that disappoints: the diplomacy system, trading and don't get me started on the leader system. First of all, leaders/heroes have a limited life span, which sounds like a neat feature on paper but is incredibly annoying in practice. Second, leaders can be elected president, which immediately stops them from doing what they are doing and essentially removes them from the game. You need to manually(!) look through all your leader assignments, find out/guess which slot now became empty and hire/find a replacement. Combat is ok, even though quite basic. Some more control of fleet tactics would be nice (such as ordering sniper ships to at least try keep their optimal distance from the opponent).\n\nAll in all, in my view at least, Stellaris is mostly a combination of old and not very exiting ideas in a new package. Now, there are some things that are quite neat, like the heavy utilisation of random events (storytelling, research, etc.) which do offer meaningful choices. But the tedious micromanagement and non-exiting gameplay are still big downers in my book. I would have wished for the game to try more advanced/novel solutions instead of pushing the player into the old boring micromanagement minigames.\n","May 17","false","16.5"," 77 of 113 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","77","113","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dipex/recommended/281990/","Dipex","Dipex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dipex/","224 products in account","This game is getting a lot of amazing reviews on Steam, but it really doesn't deserve them *at this point*, as the game has a tremendous amount of problems.\n\nBy far the biggest problem is the lack of a competent UI and some very basic automation features.\n\nFor example, there is no screen from which you can see/give build orders to your spaceports.  Likewise, there is no way to rally production from your spaceports.  This all makes building up a fleet in a large empire unnecessarily tedious.\n\nUpgrading ships also feels like it wasn't playtested.  There is a flat time cost to upgrading a ship regardless of how much you're changing on it - and that cost is very close to the time cost of building a completely new ship.  This means it isn't usually worth upgrading ships for marginal improvements, and makes upgrading large fleets quite tedious.  Unless you want your fleets to be locked in dock for a *very long time* you need to split them up multiple times and then scatter them across your empire, keeping in mind that, again, you have no way of telling where your spaceports are short of manually searching every system on the map.\n\nNow, producing/upgrading ships isn't a problem in the early game when you only have a few systems.  But the scale of Stellaris means that by the late game you may have upwards of 100 systems, at which point the poor UI makes these very core, basic tasks overwhelmingly tedious.\n\nThe game would be infinitely better if there was just a screen that you could control and rally production from, if the time cost of upgrading a ship was based on the work actually being done to the ship, and if there was a button you could click that would just automatically break a fleet up into smaller chunks and send them off to be upgraded.  Or, alternatively, a way to just set spaceports to contribute their production to a centralized spaceport.  For example, if every spaceport in a sector automatically added its production capacity to the sector capital spaceport so that the capital spaceport could very rapidly produce/upgrade ships while the rest of the sector's spaceports were inaccessible.\n\nThere is also no autoexplore option for your science vessels, which isn't a huge deal in the early game but in an 800 star sized map, you basically just reach a point where you stop exploring because you've explored your immediate area of the galaxy and exploring the far off reaches is extremely tedious and of very limited strategic value.  *Every* 4x game released in the last 4 years has had an autoexplore feature, and for Stellaris not to have one is inexcusable.\n\nWhich leads me to the main point of why the game sucks in its current state - which is that it just doesn't feel like it was playtested past the first few hours (which is something that Paradox is notorious for).  The basic systems and mechanics in the game are all good and fun, but their implementation is just poor in general.  And that poor implementation itself just comes from things being slightly off - things that don't require much testing to notice or much work to fix.\n\nI could probably write a doctoral thesis on all of the small things wrong with diplomacy, sectors, fleet combat, and the UI (other than what I've already mentioned), but its probably easier and more effective to just sum the current problems up with an analogy.  The current state of Stellaris feels like if you hired someone to paint your house, and while he did a good job on what he painted he also left small sections of every room unpainted.  You would look at that and say "I mean sure he knows what he's doing but he needs to get back in here and finish painting the walls."  Thats basically Stellaris.\n\nNone of its current problems feels like they will be hard to fix, and Paradox has a history of continuing active development on their games.  In fact, Stellaris is no different than any other Paradox game in that respect - with Paradox games you always pay full price for a beta version of the game that gets its major problems fixed over the next 6 months in patches, with major feature improvements regularly released as $30 DLC.  Its just dissapointing because starting with HOI3 they promised to stop doing the whole "paying for a beta" thing.  But they haven't yet made good on that promise and Stellaris is no exception.\n\nIf you're looking to buy Stellaris I would hold off right now and check back in a month or two once the game has been patched a bit, because right now it really needs it.","May 14","false","75.5"," 362 of 594 people (61%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","61","362","594","10","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/281990/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","A Romp & Stomp Through the Stars The Grand Strategy/4X Hybrid that is a true paradox on a 2D map, with mechanics that feel so 3D you’ll forget you’re not in space. To explain the basics of Paradox Studio’s latest thrill ride, a riddle:\n\nIn a rectangular room, 30’X12’X12’, a spider is at the middle of an end wall, one foot from the ceiling. The fly is at the middle of the opposite end wall, 1 foot above the floor. The fly is scared & can’t move. What is the shortest distance the spider must crawl to capture the fly?\nAre you scratching this out on paper already? Either way, Stellaris is likely for you. Gameplay focuses on combat & exploration. The Math is done by the game. Everything: from the stats the AI uses, to the strength of opposing forces in battle, is transparent in the game. You explore the Galaxy, but have to fight for control. Features include land armies, naval ships you can build to spec, & pirates.\n\nGrand Strategy: Grand Strat is a balancing act of managing many complex features of the game at once like a waitress with arms loaded with plates. But here, instead of micro-managing, you have the unique ability to delegate whole Solar Systems to Sector management by the AI, while you concentrate on the macro-management/ big picture dev of your empire. You control the leaders, Scientists, & Construction Ships (CS) that carry out your orders. Simply clicking on the sun of a solar system (SS), while having a CS selected, will present order options so that you can queue up research stations (RS) or mines for the whole SS for example. But, anytime you don’t like the direction something is going, you can seize control & redirect.\n\n4X Popular for a Reason: I love TBS 4X games like Civ 5, where you accumulate wealth & dominate the world to the tune of a victory condition, while taking turns with the AI civs. Traditionally, Grand Strat games leave that aside for a strictly sandbox style where you walk out on the world stage and wonder what to do 1st. But, Stellaris is like a gateway drug into the world of Grand Strat. You can see the basic goals of the game, & you know where you want to go, without any hand-holding.\n\nGameplay: The goal of the game is to wander the galaxy, researching as many SS’s as you can, while building colonies, mines, or RS’s on them. The zone around the outside of your empire is your known world, which you push outward as you explore with your ships. You can’t build there, unless you totally explore the SS, & then build a frontier outpost on the star to push out the borders of your empire in any direction you outpost. Then it’s yours & you can build. But, you are limited by resources, energy, & especially influence, because it builds up slowly over time. Certain tasks, like meeting leader mandates, will give bonuses in influence.\nBuild a decent navy of at least 2 fleets. Send 1 fleet with the Science ship, & 1 with the CS, & zip from planet to planet laying claim. Just be careful not to “forward settle” the AI empires. If you claim a star close to an AI, they see this as aggression, and they will destroy you before you’ve had time to build a big navy. Cautiously, take stars to either side of AI, & leave buffer stars until you are ready to fight.\nMeanwhile, you will encounter either “nasty aliens” if you are a Xenophobe, or intriguing alien races, if you have a Xenophile type personality. You can either fight or flee to safe planets in the early game stage of exploration & colonization. In the mid-game, you must begin to form alliances & trade networks, or begin waging war to take resources from other empires. Late game, game-changing special events occur.\n\nWinning & losing: Unlike most grand strat games, Stellaris has winning conditions. You can win by domination, or by colonizing 40% of the habitable planets. To score achievies, you must select Ironman mode, which is really no big deal in Paradox games. Many achievies are easily obtained without winning the game.\n\nEmergent Story-telling: Stellaris reminds me of XCOM in the way you get to choose which research you will focus on, directing your own course. Meanwhile, event chains are unraveled through popups, with story to read. It gives the added romp of a great RPG by allowing you to see unexpected events unfold in a Sci-fi narrative that is extremely playful & intriguing.\n\nPros:\n*Narrative is extensive; Soundtrack, Graphics & art are great\n*DLC provides enjoyable ringtones, e-book novel & artbook\n*Feature Rich & Fully customizable creative experience\n\nCons:\n*Tutorial an annoyance to be turned off; see key mapping in options\n*Situation Log sketchy; Outliner needs to be longer to view more info\n*MP causes desync issues on low-end machines/ rural satellite internet\n\nStellaris is a stellar Sci-fi strategy game with extreme re-play value. With 100+ hours in the week since release, the game is addictive, time-consuming, & one of the best gaming experiences in the galaxy. I highly recommend it for gamers of all ages who enjoy info intensive strategy games.","May 14","true","126.5"," 74 of 109 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","74","109","0","10"

Difficulty and learning curve are easier than Europa Universalis, though this may change when more DLC comes out. The game is very easy to get into, especially if you're familiar with Paradox games. It's in more of a "fantasy/sci-fi" environment than their other stuff, so if you're not into that then I'd avoid this. However, if you want to fight aliens, this game is for you.\n\nPros:\n-Very immersive writing\n-Strategy is necessary, not just ship spam\n-Different playstyles supported and encouraged\n-Both pros and cons to playing tall and wide\n-Interesting mechanics that make managing a large empire less "micro-y" but still challenging\n-Insanely well-developed early game\n-Colonizing planets is super fun\n-Late game crises make steamrolling impossible\n\nCons:\n-Mid game can get very dull\n-After a certain size, scientific research becomes practically pointless\n-"Strategic Resources" don't feel very important, just kind of nice to have\n-Sectors lack the depth they demand\n-Diplomacy is pretty bland for a Paradox game\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a solid 8/10.

The system itself is broken and no amount of tinkering is going to fix it.   Either the player is able to predictably benefit from interacting with the other Race, in which case the player will do so, or the player is going to ignore the Diplomacy system - in which case it is nothing more than a bother.\n\nFor me, Star Ruler 2 is the best Space 4x game to be released so far, and this game adds very little to the genre.  The event system is nice - but they need to add hundreds more events because right now the same handful of events are repeated over and over.\n\nI give Stellaris a thumbs down, even though it's not a horrible game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/l11enk/recommended/281990/","l11enk","Яowan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/l11enk/","231 products in account","Review for Stellaris\nAt full price? I can't recommend, for a number of reasons, of which I will go into further into this review. TL;DR would be that it is a pretty shallow and though polished, it is rather undeveloped and the developers have purposesfully left a lot to want in preparation for DLC spam.\n\nIf you want to know what sort of spam, just look at CK2's DLC list. Fourty plus items, if I recall correctly. Although you can get them pretty cheap given enough time during sales, it is still a hefty amount for a hefty sum.\n\nAt a sale price or after some updates and possibly an expansion or two, Stellaris could very well be worth the money spent. However, at this point in time it is impossible to know exactly where it will go.\n\nParadox is good at making feature rich games like Crusader Kings 2 (CK2), Europa Universalis IV (EUIV), but getting there takes time. Some of their games have had rocky starts and have a decent amount of content, others like Stellaris have had thus far a smooth and stable start, but are very much lacking in content.\n\nThe Good\n\n+ Stable multiplayer. Did an eight-hour long game with twenty others in a group I play with without a single hiccup at all. Smooth as silk, with working hotjoin! A big surprise, given how broken multiplayer is in say, Crusader Kings 2 at times.\n\n+ Diverse selection of species. Unfortunantly they don't have quite as big as an impact as one might wish for, more onto that later. But cool designs and a reasonably large number to choose from, which is always sweet.\n\n+ You can customise your starting ethics and racial traits. All species have access to the same traits sadly. Ethics/Ethos allow you to be peaceful, militaristic and so on. You can make your political makeup somewhat unique compared to other playthroughs. Only a couple are actually viable for competetive multiplayer, though.\n\n+ Ship editing and customisation. It's there, it does the job. Not the most sophisticated system around, and somewhat lacking compared to other games in the genre.\n\n+ Purges, enslavement and eugeni- uh. Racial modifications. Uplift other species and over time force them to submit to your ethics, modify them as you will.\n\n+ Political 'map' in mid to late game reminds one of games such as EVE. Large empires can wage huge wars, federations form and politics can get interesting. On MP, at least. AI is rather lackluster and not very good at that sort of thing. Or staying alive, either.\n\n+ Large scale. Number of stars isn't everything, and games like Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion prove as much, but it honestly helps create a sense of awe in space.\n\nThe Bad\n\n+ Ship combat system is incredibly simplistic, in a very bad way. Factors such as range not being used (LRMs will engage in melee like every other ship, for example, instead of staying at their max range) and the complete lack of control over ship orders and priority targets leaves battles completely at the mercy of RNG and your ship compositions. AI isn't very good at countering player navy makeups, if it even tries at all. You can't even tell your fleet to target specific high value targets in a fleet.\n= Could be fixed by moving the system to something closer to what is in Endless Space, as the combat system does sort of emulate what is used in that game, but is less complex for it lacks difference phases (Long range, medium range, melee and tactics).\n= Could be fixed by moving the system into something closer to Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. Different ship types serve a different purpse; LRMs will sit back out of harm's way, whilst corvettes and destroyers armed with lasers and short range kinetics will engage in melee sort of thing. Give commander the ability to pick which targets (individual ships in an engaged fleet) the fleet focuses on, or what certain ships should focus on.\n= Something between the two could be good, maybe. Really, anything other than what it is now would be better.\n= Because come on, Star Ruler 2, Endless Space and Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion all do space combat far better. SR2 is made by a tiny (two?) man team in their free time, and is leagues better between the customization system and combat!\n\n+ Planet classes only affect two things; when you can colonise it -> The required pre-requisite technology and the resulting habitability (which affects in turn how fast pop grows), which is based on your starting planet class. Then graphics, what the planet 'looks like'.\n= Some planets, like Tomb worlds, being special planet types are somewhat unique. But even then the differences are far from significant.\n= Many planets, such as toxic, barren or lava worlds can't even be terraformed in the late game.\n= Could be fixed by adjusting what sort of resource outputs are given by different classes. Some should give more minerals, others more energy, some more of x or y tech, others biased towards having more space to build but less resources and so on.\n\n+ Species and Phenotype don't affect what traits can be picked, only diplomacy. All of them live for the same number of (base) years, which is 60-70 years. No actual advantages or disadvantages to picking one or another. This means, at the end of the day, what you pick only affects the graphics of a pop you see every time you click on a planet, fleet or whatever unless you're dealing with people who've picked xenophobic ethos.\n= Could be tended to by giving certain races unique traits, more or less slots for trait adjustments, different bases ages (possibly with some randomisation) so tree people and turtle people live longer than a human.\n\n+ No trade systems. I mean trade as in trade ships - you can exchange planets, map information, vision, alliances and resources in deals, but you can't exchange the frequently mentioned (by capitalist-style empires) trade agreements.\n= Would love to be able to build trade stations and would like to watch trade ships move back and forth, even if they are simply sprites for performance reasons. Come on Paradox! Every damn game has this sort of thing in as a default feature, yet you've left it out.\n\n+ Ship customization is quite limited. Paradox should take note of Star Ruler 2 and their ship customization system. Not asking for that system exactly, but it is a damn good idea and is very well executed.\n\n+ Stale mid to late game. I think they've done a seriously good job at the early game, other than the above problems which only become apparently later in the game and/or through multiple playthroughs. I've got a lot to say as to what could be done, but it is very likely that they have intentionally made these parts stale so to give room for extra $$$ DLC.\n= At least if the host owns the DLC, all clients get it. They've confirmed it'll still be the case for this game, so there is that, thank paradox.\n\n+ Feels quite shallow. I'd say it is quite shallow, for I feel it has less in it than EUIV did on release and many others say it has far less than CK2 did, too.","May 11","false","53.1"," 123 of 194 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","123","194","4","4"

Vassal states, alliances, federations all provide players with the building blocks to build up and break down each other’s empires.\nCONS:There is no tech tree rather you get 3 semi-random choices of technology which prevents a lot of long term strategy and planning from working.\nGame suffers from pacing issues as once all the stars are explored there is a lot of waiting around for stuff to finish with nothing to do during times of peace.\nPrimary weapon and defense technologies are very generic, there are some cool weapons you can get from side quests but 75% of the part upgrades are the exact same thing but with slightly higher stats.\nSUMMARY:	Stellaris is first and foremost a multiplayer game and my recommendation of Stellaris is only as a multiplayer game. As a single player experience the game is lackluster because there is only so much cooperation you can do with the AI and even then the game tends to stagnate once you have explored the entire region. That’s not to say that the AI is bad, but where the diplomatic and governmental systems shine brightest is when they are being used with and against real players. How much enjoyment you get out of the game will be directly based on if you can get your friends together, team up, and blowing each other out of the galaxy.\n\nEXTRA NOTE: Game was provided by the developer solely for review purposes with no compensation or incentive to give a positive review.

The game is also championed by a vastly improved user interface when compared with other Paradox games and has a far more inviting learning curve without losing the challenge or depth that the other games by this highly regarded developer offer.\n\nParadox are widely known for their catalogue of strategy games over the years which are of a very high quality but are also remarkably complex to an extent; some newcomers and even veterans of the genre felt alienated, confused and simply overwhelmed. Stellaris however, has a fully fledged tutorial integrated into the main campaign which not only guides you through the general mechanics along with each feature in a constructive manner; it explains aspects clearly and this is further supported by a far more user friendly interface. The screen is less cluttered when compared with the likes of Europa Universalis IV and all the information is clear, condensed and well presented.\n\nThe game takes place in space which is an almost Call of Duty style departure from the typical Paradox titles of classic eras and a real world setting. The premise is also slightly different as you create your colony from scratch or by selecting some preset examples instead of guiding an already established country. Your goal in the galaxy is to explore, build, research, expand, conquer and even exterminate all other races you come across - basically exactly what you'd expect from a 4X title. You can play this game however you wish and at your own pace -  you may opt to be a fanatic militarist or simply want to discover as much of the universe as possible whilst befriending and benefitting from other races you meet along the way. It is a massively detailed and highly engrossing experience in which the developers have made the transition from reality to sci-fi in a very credible fashion.\n\nStellaris runs superbly too and is bolstered by truly fantastic atmosphere enhancing audio that compliments your game throughout. The visuals are very good too and the galaxy map whilst despite looking rather basic, is easy to grasp and understand which is another massive plus. Overall; Stellaris is another superb Paradox title that is riddled with depth and a long term challenge but is also presented and executed in a far more appealling and enjoyable way than some previous titles by the studio. This game will have a bright future and is sure to provide many hours of entertainment.","May 11","true","25.6"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","32","40","0","0"

Now, here are the questions people ask when they first hear about it or want to know about it:\n\nIs it as hard as x Paradox game?\nand Is it like civ?\n\nThe answers are no and no.\n\nStellaris is a 4x game cleverly disguised as a grand strategy game.\n\nExploration: In the opening stages of the game, you explore using science ships your surrounding systems while finding new planets to colonize and encountering events. This is a typical space 4x mechanic and exists in most other games of the genre. Does this compare to other grand strategy games? Not really. Even EU4's 'search' function in the New World is different. How is this distinct from other 4x games? The events are more varied and better written, and have far more interesting fluff.\n\nColonizing: Colonization is a very simple 'build colony ship, send ship, wait' mechanic, as is similar to other 4x games. Actual land and building development is like a cross between Civilization 4/5 and Galactic Civilizations 2/3. Every planet has different tiles that you build buildings on (each tile giving different static resources or none at all), and you assign pops (citizens) to work each tile as they grow and spawn on the planet over time based on food surplus or migration from other colonies. This is all very standard 4x. There is not much that makes these features very distinct, and it is done in a very standard way.\n\nPops: Now comes the first mechanic that is even vaguely grand strategy: pops and how they function. Every pop individually has four things: a species, ethics, happiness, and ethical divergence. Ethics are a feature in Stellaris that begin based on your Empire's 'governing ethics', and vary from spiritualism to materialism to militarism and pacificm. These are the reigning values that determine a great deal about the paths of tech you will go down to how your pops act and how other empires perceive you. Pops begin with these ethics, but they change over time; as generations are want to do.\n\nEthics: You can do all sorts of things to encourage or discourage this ethical divergence, and whole populations of your original species may become wholly different from your core populations. This mechanic has the most depth of any mechanic in the entire game. In addition to these ethics, you have a couple other tools available to you if you so wish to reign your empire as they require: slavery and purging. Slavery makes pops work better in manual labor tiles such as farming and mining, but work worse in tiles with research and similar things. Purging is literal genocide or xenocide. Want to Imperium of Man your way and purge all xenos? Go for it. I was proud to see Paradox allow that, as they've been historically wary of slavery or genocide, but I guess aliens are less real than the actual slavery that happened in Africa and America (fu paradox don't revisionist history.). However, even if this has the most depth, it still has less depth than the pop system in Vic2.\n\nTech: The other entirely unique feature is the tech system. Tech works by drawing from a 'deck' for 3 (or more with modifiers) cards, which you can pick from to start your next research assignment based on three different research paths that operate parallel to one another. After picking the tech you want to research, the other two(+) go back into the deck to be drawn later. This means you may miss out on a tech for a while if you choose to skip it, making important decisions early on even more pressing. This becomes a lot less interesting in the lategame when most techs are already researched and there's a lot of 'repreated' techs that fill up the lists, so I hope more hard decision techs are added later.\n\nFTL: FTL travel has three methods, all three of which are standard 4x tropes. Warp (warp to any system in range, cooldown, warmup, slowish travel time), hyperlanes (can only travel between connected systems, fast, minimal warmup and cooldown) and warp gates (build gates in systems, huge range, very fast, little cooldown, limited by aforementioned built gates). These are very standard and if you've played any other 4x games you know how they work.\n\nWar: Warfare is standard as well, and the ship designer is a simple slot-based affair where you stick weapons and modules into a design and it spits out damage and armor values on a generic ship model of which there is only one per class. This will most certainly be expanded in an expansion, though I would have liked to see something more indepth such as Galciv's or Star Ruler 2's systems. It has a few different types of weapons that each are countered by different things. This mostly matters in the early game, because lategame weapons rek everything but aren't quite on the level of really late game galciv things.\n\nDiplomacy: The game does not have very robust diplomacy. I would say it's even slightly below par with other 4x games; and most certainly extremely below par (triple, quad bogey) with grand strategy games. Almost all of your relations have to do with your ethics and government types rather than logical tactical neccessity or events. Embassies are a boring shallow feature when there is nothing you can really do with it. It seems entirely up to the AI who it wants to ally with, and there's not too much you can do to affect that. And if you go militarist; well, good luck finding allies. Additionally, when you do have an ally, you have to declare war together or not at all. Not being able to declare war on my own is an annoying and backwards restriction. I can understand the restriction in the larger federations, but I should not be locked to the wishes of my ally should I want to venture on something myself. You can easily get around this by offering him a planet, but then simply not giving it to him at the end of the war, since apparently the AI just doesn't care. Exploits.\n\nAI: The AI is mediocre or even bad in most cases, though it has that "perfect micro" that pdox AI often has where it can snipe things that you would never normally think about just because it can, but when it comes to actually making good decisions it falls on its face.\n\nPerformance: Performance is okay until the lategame when a lot of things are happening, where it hits the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ really fast. Hopefully this is improved in time.\n\nRandom Events: My primary complaint is the complete lack of non-surveying events. When you aren't surveying or observing pre-ftl species, there are just very few events that occur randomly and have something to read or think about. This is the sprinkling of grand strat, that even when you're waiting around for things to build, you typically get a steady stream of events to read or do things with, with the occasional big event you really have to deal with or think about. With several of the quest lines being currently broken and the only other long event lines being the end game crises, this is one of the big reasons (as well as the lack of diplomacy as stated above) the midgame is so reportedly BORING. War after war isn't fun, and internal issues are sparse with so few events. We'll certainly hopefully get more with expansions, but that requires them to keep putting more of the grand strat wool over the 4x core rather than submitting to the masses who just want space civ.\n\nOverall, it's a solid 4x game, and a refreshing take on a genre (space 4x) that has been stagnant for years. Does it beat DW in complexity? Oh, lord no. Does it beat Galciv in raw gameplay? Not really. Does it beat other grand strats in flavor and atmosphere? No.\n\nSo what is it? A pretty good 4x game, but a terrible grand strategy game. Maybe it'll be a proper one someday, but not now.\n\n:awoo:","May 14","true","38.9"," 62 of 92 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","62","92","3","5"

War system is terrible (no cb to declare; autosurrender..don't even gert me started)\n- AI is very weak. Acts passively, never really a challenge. Allied AI will blob and follow your main fleet regardless of actual strategic situation.\n- Planet development is basic at best (seen better systems in 10 year old games), espionage non existent, trade (trade routes-commerce) is absent.\n- Battles are very underwhelming. It's a paradox game I know, but really: weapons come with different ranges, but all battles invariably end up in a chaotic melee. No orders, no behaviour, just blob and pray. Very weak. Land battles were better in Moo2, a 20 year old game.\n- The resource gathering and starbase construction is very similar to galciv, it's ok but it gets repetitive. And it's not original.\n- Paradox has a strong tradition of "historical" games (real world-historic events). Without this context, I feel this game looses a LOT of appeal and originality.\n\nI mean this would be an ok game in its present state if it wasn't by Paradox.\nIf I think that this game has VIctoria 2 as a mommy and CK2 as daddy, it's really a letdown and it doesn't live up to the hype.\nOf course, there will be (many) DLCs. I personally dislike this marketing strategy (DLC spam) and I think in the long run it will be more negative than positive for gaming in general.\n\nTL;DR: would be ok if I wasn't expecting Victoria-Hoi-Ck2 in SPACE.

And there you have Stellaris: superior to Distant Worlds in almost every respect, except perhaps the private fleet (which may well be moddable).\n\nWhat makes this game really awesome is the moddability. Don't like the decisions made by the designers? Redesign the game to your own liking. Want to play in the Milky Way galaxy? make your own galaxy (or wait for someone else to make it).\n\nStellaris as released is a very enjoyably game, and I would recommend it even without the moddability. But Stellaris is so much more than that: it is essentially a tool for creating a space game that plays exactly the way you want it to.

You're discovering what the game has to offer and thinking ahead about space you want to control. Who will be your allies and enemies?\n\nThere are problems later in the game, unfortunately. For example, the war system is nonsense. When war begins you are restricted to choosing roughly 3-5 planets that you will take from the enemy (there is a 100 point cost system for your war plan). During the war you can destroy all their armies and land troops onto every one of their worlds, but in the end you can only accept the 3-5 planets you declared initially.\n\nThis means that you have to declare war multiple times against an enemy to eliminate them. When a war ends you enter a period of peace (a long period) which you must wait to expire before war can be declared again. This is simply tedium because you've already destroyed their army and scooped valuable planets out of their empire.\n\nWorse, if you are in a federation (which is how I chose to play) then you can only declare war every 40 or 50 years or so (which is probably a few hours of play, though I have not run a stopwatch on it). During the periods you cannot declare war you're twiddling your thumbs hoping the current federation president accidentally declares the war you want, or that your enemies declare a war against you (though the AI is not likely to declare a war against your superior empire). The system is incompetent.\n\nThere are numerous bugbears throughout the game that suggest development ended prematurely. For example, you're forced to yield control of planets to the AI, but this AI neglects your citizen's basic need of happiness, giving rise to rebellions (what this game calls "factions").\n\nThe UI is sometimes obtuse and on occasion wildly misleading. You will make several mistakes on this basis. For example, the game mislead me to colonise planets with the wrong species, resulting in them being miserable and rebellious. On top of this, the game offers poor or no solutions to correct the problem. These planets I made mistakes on are likely to be permanently doomed. My only out is to become evil and purge (kill) them, but this would be suicide due to the political ramifications.\n\nI hope they can improve and polish these systems with further iterations of this game (patches, DLC, expansions, whatever). In the meantime I think you're better off playing a 4x game that is more mature.","May 15","false","67.8"," 96 of 151 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","96","151","3","0"

A lot of buttons are purely cosmetical and have no actual purpose at all. Do you want the sectors managed by the AI to focus on mineral production or energy production? Too bad... all the AI does is build farms on your planets anyway, regardless of which option you ultimately choose. Do you want to allow the AI to replace existing buildings on planets? Beautiful... the AI actually razed one of the many unnecessary farms only to replace it with... guess what... Yes! Another farm! Such variety!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zyffer/recommended/281990/","zyffer","Ye Ole Zyffer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zyffer/","239 products in account","This game is wonderful!  Firstly, creating your own custom race and empire is one of the best parts of the game.  You choose everything from what type of species you are, what sort of planet you came from, your ethics and government, visuals, and starting weapon systems (guns, missles, or lasers), and even method of FTL travel.\n\nThere are 3 options.  Standard warp, slow but non-restrictive, hyperspace, fast but dependent on naturally occuring hyperspace "lanes" or Wormhole gates, instant travel to or from a system within range of a warpgate. One of the more unique choices i've seen in a space 4x game.  The game even reacts quite well to your choices when it comes to your empire's ethics and government types.  Dialogue boxes will change to reflect your empires outlook on alien lifeforms and the cosmos in general.\n\nYou start off just after your first FTL capable ships are created and the whole galaxy is a mystery, your first task is scanning all the objects in your home system that until now your species as only gazed at through telescopes.  You'll find strange anomolies that spawn research projects and discover wonderous new worlds.  The early game perfectly captures the feeling of curiosity and exploration.  As you progress you may encounter primitive civilizations that you can subjagate or silently observe in the hopes of one day uplifting them.  You'll obviously also encounter other empires with which you must either befriend or make your foe.\n\nThe war system on this game is also quite unique, at the start of a war you declare what you want to get out of it.  If you are scary enough you might be able to get them to just give you a planet to avoid a war.  If a war does start the game keeps track of battles won and lost and give you a war score that will affect how much you can demand at the peace talks should you choose to negotiate an end to the hostilities.  The better your score the more likely you are to get a favorably lopsided peace deal.\n\nBeing that the game only released today i have not gotten much father than my first real war with another empire, which I won and I forced him to become my vassal.  But it is amazing how many options you have to deal with other empires.   You can create an embassy which will slowly make them like you over time or declare them a rival which makes them dislike you greatly but you gain influence points which you spend on things like frontier outposts to expand your borders or on Edicts (essentially passive bonuses to your empire that cost continual influence upkeep).\n\nGraphically the game is gorgeous.  I often find myself just roaming my systems staring at the strange or beatiful worlds I encounter.\n\nAll in all if you are a Sci-fi fan, or a fan of 4x games your gonna wanna check this out.  If you like Sci-fi AND 4X games this game is a MUST HAVE.\n\nIf your new to the 4X genre the game might be a bit overwhelming as there can be a lot of micromanaging.  However the game has a great tutorial system that explains the game as you go without getting in the way too much.  Also there are a few ways to automate management on certain things if you hate micromanagement.\n\nI'm not sure if I've played it enough to give it a X/10 number yet but I played it non-stop since release today and never felt bored or frustrated.  It has excellent pacing and is the most enjoyable 4x game i've played in a while.  It does a great job of making the galaxy feel vibrant and alive.  Honestly I can't recommend this game enough.

Even a single planet without any stations can support an infinitely large fleet, which isn't fun if your fleets are the same size + they have a spaceport.\n\nWar declarations are stupid in this game. You can only declare on planets they have settled, which are very often not the ones you want. You want ones that suit your race. But you can't declare for an unsettled system. You have to take a system that they have settled, even if you don't want it.\n\nCombat's pretty bad. The AI is exploitably stupid. send a single warship from the other direction, their fleet leaves the planet, you can wipe out the spaceport and then the fleet separately. Which is the only way I've found of beating cheating AIs - see above. You also can't tell your ships - hey stay inside the aura of this defense station - it's actually what's going to win this fight. Or to retreat without leaving the system. I just wanted them to back up a bit - why get in range of the stations if you don't have to?\n\nAs for the RPS system of lasers/shields etc. That's great and all. But in order to find out what your opponent uses... you need to invade. Hooray. No espionage in the game, nor are they likely to venture into range of your scanners with their fleet. Good luck building that fleet after your war dec.\n\nForget getting the AI to make a deal either. Seems like even just to trade charts you'll need to send them more than a far share to get a deal passed. The diplomacy of EU4 is gone. Replaced with the braindead "why is this even in the game" diplomacy of Civ5:BE. It also happens between two screens you'll need to keep changing between endlessly. Yeah, embassies and alliances happen in this screen, but trades and pacts happen in this other screen. No you can't exchange for systems that aren't settled (i.e. useful ones) and if you could, I don't doubt the AI would never agree. There's simply no tools to handle relations with other relations, nor are there the nice and transparent summary screens of EU4. You get embassies and rivals. That's never enough.\n\nAnd the ♥♥♥♥ing primitive planets. There's no way for a xenophobic race to deal with them. I just want them gone. But no diplomacy with them to wage war against them... ♥♥♥♥. You have four ♥♥♥♥♥♥ options, and they become a ticking time bomb. If they become a vassal they instantly take all the nearby systems with them. Even if the system they were in had a frontier station. Great - guess I'll wage war against them in ... 10 years. Even if the race is some screwed up "kill all other species" race. No Paradox, I get to kill them now.\n\nAlso, there seems to be no way of ignoring peace deals. I'm waging war just to destroy all life on their planets, and they end up giving them to me... I don't want that. I declared war to empty their planets, so I can move in. If I'm not a race that can purge - what is my recourse then? You can't deal with these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ planets of other races - the tools for integration amount to an endless spending of your points to keep a faction happy. And slaves suck. Oh boy do they suck. 50% production? What? So they can starve?\n\nAlso, the tech drafting can ruin your game. You want to colonise? Guess it hasn't come up yet. You need bigger ships or better weapons because yours are out of date? Screw you, research one of these instead.\n\nI don't really want to play this game anymore. Frankly. I appreciate some of the grind has been taken away from games like MoO, of managing planets and so on. But that comes back the moment building stations on multiple systems becomes tedious. It's also all the game really is. Exploration. Expansion dies off so quickly, there's no reason to fight other civs, because what you'll get you won't want. Stellaris is a 1X game at best. Because the other 3X's it falls down at, so hard. It's not grand strategy either. Not in the slightest.\n\nIf there was a faster speed than fastest I certainly would have been using it. In the end it's just as shallow as the new MoO is. Event chains certainly don't save it.\n\nThese are fundamental problems, and maybe DLC will fix them (cynically I think that may have been paradox's plan from day one) but it will be a long time coming.","May 12","false","48.7"," 221 of 371 people (60%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","60","221","371","12","6"

You wouldn't even be here reading reviews if you don't like space 4x games, and this is a great 4x game\n\nGalaxy and FactionsFirst of all you start in a galaxy of a maximum of 1000 stars(there are mods to play even more stars). planets/asteroids,etc are in orbit around stars, which adds a nice immersion, Factions are randomly generated every game, instead of the same old prebuilt factions that you have in other 4x games, although you can build your own factions to spawn in the galaxy if you wish do to so. and there's lots and lots of different variable options so that you basically will never meet the same faction twice, huge number of government types, ideas, culture, races, ship types, FTL types, etc. Faction customization is great, It's like every possible faction personality is available to create. you can even customize the random names the factions give to their people, ships, fleets, armies, planets, stars, etc.\n\nTons of events are happening in the galaxy as well, giving it more personality and flavor, sometimes the game gives you quest-like missions where you have to study this wreckage, then it will lead to another points of interests, leading to new techs, bonuses, etc.\n\nEmpire/GovernmentEmpire management is awesome, you can actually select your type of government(and change it in-game) resulting in different types of bonuses and government systems. You can have a democracy where there's an election every 5 years, 50 years, or a dictatorship, empire, religion-based faction, science-lead faction, etc, etc. Each elected leader has different personalities as well, with different aims, platforms, etc. Some ruler will want to bring back slavery to your empire when elected for example. Rulers are picked from a pool of leaders, basically your admirals, generals, researchers, and governors in your empire, and they have different agendas if they get elected as leader, Support the one you like the most. Factions can also form up inside your empire if your population's culture and beliefs become more and more varied. Some people may like the current government, some people may want changes or reforms.\n\nThe population system is also well-made. You can actually play as a non-genocidal xenophilic type, where every race(or certain races only, it's up to you) is welcome to your empire. again, unlike other 4x games where it's you or them. You can have an empire composing of many different races, and they can have different privileges, like giving them rights to vote, to move freely, etc. You can be as racist as you like or as welcoming as you like. or both! welcome them, and then exterminate them! Your choice. You can even genetically manipulate your own species, or other races, or create robots, androids, or genetically enhanced soldiers, some races might be better soldiers than others, use them as such.\n\nDiplomacySome would say the diplomacy is lacking compared to other games, but I beg to differ. There's lots of things to do in the diplomacy side. First of all, FEDERATIONS, you can actually form federations with different factions, not just alliances, but federations, you elect a federation president every few years and rotate around the different members, the federation also has their own shared federation fleet, comprising of technology taken from all the members. It's similar to GalCiv's United Planets but you aren't forced to join and it's not automatically created for everyone, even enemy factions. Lots of different treaties like star chart sharing, non-aggression treaties, embassies, research ventures, and good ol' resource trading. There's no traditional 'trade lines' trading like in galciv though. You can make a faction your vassal, and there are multiple types, you can even play as vassal to another empire and eventually liberate yourself from it if you want to. you can also integrate them into your empire.\n\nOne more awesome thing is you can actually see primitive civilizations in game!, and they all vary and you can see them in different states, whether they are in the early space age, bronze age, industrial, etc. or you might even see a dead world where a past civilization blew themselves up due to nuclear war. If you are playing as non-humans, you might even see our own Solar System!, maybe we blew ourselves up? maybe you just arrived in time before we do? or you arrived during our cavemen days and chose to observe us instead? You can observe them, advance their technology, abduct them for experiments or even uplift them, or invade and exterminate them.\n\nResourcesResources system is well made, you mine minerals from planets, asteroids, either from orbit, or if you have the planet colonized, on the ground. You need minerals basically for everything that you construct. You can construct power plants, in lots of different ways in order to get Energy Credits, which is the main currency of the game. You also have three research resources: Society, Engineering and Physics, and different celestial bodies give bonuses to them when an orbital station or facility is constructed. You also gain influence points to use on diplomacy or actions related to your empire/faction/government.\n\nResearch and TechnologyYou also can have three researches going on in parallel, which is Society, Engineering and Physics, which is much more immersive as well. no more having to decide whether to research for your colony infrastructure first or for your military strength, etc. Technology is smartly randomized every time you finish a research, meaning, there is no fixed research tree, you get the immersion of really researching stuff, as you won't know what technology lies far ahead.\n\nWarfareSpace Warfare is similar to your usual Space RTS games, with the good addition of Turn Based like status reports, where you can see statistics of the battle while it is going on, there is also land warfare in which you can create and recruit armies and invade planets to finally colonize them, you can also get air support from your ships in orbit and bombard the planet however way you want.\n\nThoughts about the gameGreat game, huge great potential to become one of the best space 4x games ever made after more content is made(DLCs, expansions) I'm not saying it's lacking content though, it's got more than enough to keep you playing. My expectations on this game was not that high considering all other recent 4X games have been 'meh' for me, and I haven't really played any Paradox Interactive games that much. It's already better than most if not all other 4x games out there, and it's only going to get better with time.\n\nScore: 9.5/10\n\nAs of writing this, it's 94% positive right now on steam reviews. worth the price.","May 12","true","117.0"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","25","32","0","0"

Therefore, you do the 4x'es: Xplore, Xpand, Xploit, Xterminate. You build buildings on your planets, you can terraform them, you can build stations around planets that gather resources or give research points, you can trade or you can go to war, either as the lone wolf or in an alliance.\nSounds great, doesn't it?\nIt does. But the problem is the 5th X: The Xecution. Trading is even worse than in Civ 5 where you had trade routes AND instant trade: Here, you don't have trade routes at all. If you remember the ♥♥♥♥-poor trade menu in Civ 5 with the tiny lines you had to click on and thought it was the worst system possible: Think again. Here, you have a similar list structure, that is bigger, but you have to switch tabs between offerings and demands. Also, the AI sometimes doesn't even accept presents, depite being "friendly". However, the AI does only do something when it is sure it will be accepted. So the AI builds alliances at staggering speeds, while you have to check every in-game month whether any of the AI would accept an alliance invite. Diplomacy? Feel free to estabish vastly overpowered embassies, ameliorating the standing with the other faction - until you run of of them, as you can maximally have 4 embassies.\n\nAlso, remember setting your scout to explore mode in civ 5 and never ever having to manage them again until they either get to the coast or the whole map was explored? Well, be excited by this immersive gameplay decision Stellaris has made: Get ready to manage every very single system survey by hand. Automatic exploration? Nope.\n\nSame goes for contruction ships (the workers in Civ 5). Automation? Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. It's even more tedious as your faction's borders expand with time and planets that you couldn't previously mine become available. So if you have a Chile-Style empire (long and narrow), get ready to check all few years whether you can exploit more systems.\n\nReaseach is similar: Get ready to select research targets from 3 different sections (Society, Science and Engineering), which is fun until you run out of Scientists and you get a 20% malus on the research speed. The scientists themselves are Leaders: Guys you need to buy for influence because... ? Civ 5 had a similar thing by being able to buy prophets and stuff for faith points, but they were more or less optional. In Stellaris you don't get anywhere without research.\n\nSo far, we've established that the diplomacy lacks practically everything needed to be able to be a valuable way to go. Alright. Not what I would have hoped for in a strategy game like this. But then again, war can be entertaining as well, right?\n\nAaaand nope. It all boils down to the simple rule: Steamroll everything or get steamrolled. Remember in Civ 5, when you were furios about the tremendous defense strength a city had, making it nearly impossible to conquer a city until you had catapults? Well, this time, your planets are about the weakest things in the game. Sure, they can't be conquered in the first few minutes, but as your empire grows, it becomes impossible to defend every single planet. Big fleets are far better, even for defense, which is weird at best.\nAlliances do a ♥♥♥♥ job of defending you btw, and the (thankfully disablable) empires starting with an advantage either love you or hate you from the first contact and then will steamroll you to death or leave you be. Seriously. You don't even have to give them a reason to attack you. They just do (similar to civ 5). The only problem then is: The AI does only do things when they are sure they can pull it off. So if they declare war and you're in ironman mode, exit the game and start a new one or give them half your empire, just so they can attack you again after the peace period runs out. It basically always is gg.\n\nAbout the shipdesigning: Well, you design ships. Is cool, but as your fleets will be a blob anyways and you can't see what's going on in fights, you basically just change some stat values.\n\nI personally didn't find the UI too confusing, but I can understand why some do: Too many tabs, too many hidden options and too much scrolling to do without clear indicators that you CAN scroll.\n\nIn the end, I'd consider it as a realtime CIV 5 in space without the hidious round times (as it is an RTS), but with every single contra civ 5 had (Really, it seems to me that Paradox had a checklist of all the bad things about CIV 5 to tick) and none of the pros of balance, trading and automations.\n\nI'd say: Pick it up when it's cheaper than 20 bucks, maybe even as a package with the promised DLCs (that should have been in the basegame...) so you get the game it should have been.\n\nDon't buy this barebone for 40 bucks.\n\nTL:DR:\nBuy it if you LOVED all things that were flawed in CIV 5, don't buy it if you didn't LOVE civ 5.

I didn't stay up till 6am playing it for nothing. The start is really well thought out and you genuinely feel like a species reaching out into the unknown. The anomalies are great and the randomness of techs means you will start out differently each time.\n\nI do have to agree with the mid game complaints though. The problem is that sectors are in no way comparable to playing as a King with a bunch of unruly Dukes to manage. Sectors are too simple. Basically you can add infinite planets to a sector and everything just works. Those areas become effective dead zones on the field. When your empire is growing, and the number of empires in the world is diminishing, internal politics is what would normally offset that decrease in activity. I fully expect this will be addressed in later expansions but it does feel a bit slow grinding up your ship count and having nothing internal happening to occupy you. Thinking of CK2, I consider the empire building and internal power struggles to be the mid game and it's something we don't have here yet.\n\nSome of the ship AI isn't great. I had 1000 (the max) ships attacking and they arranged themselves into a column so only 100 could shoot at any time. Pretty frustrating as there was no opportunity to change it. Fortunately the enemy did the same but it took away from the immersion somewhat.\n\nOverall I think this game is a whole lot of potential built on some solid foundations. It feels a bit weak in the diplomacy compared to Paradox' less experimental games. I'd also like to see better ship management, maybe using a 3D or layered 2D battlefield to really resolve those collision issues. End game could possibly benefit from some 'supertechs' as I was mostly just getting +5% modifiers to research.\n\nReally fun though and I look forward to it getting the true Paradox treatment over the next few years!","May 14","true","24.2"," 37 of 54 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","37","54","2","1"

It is made to be mod friendly, and it shows in base gameplay. You can mod in your own races, change starting conditions of the galaxy, and just about anything you can imagine. However, it also seems that it will be up to the mods to really take this game to the next level in the vanilla version.\n\nSo what holds this game back? I would say the scale of what this game WILL be actually hurts the fun of the vanilla game at launch. The diplomacy is simple. "I like you, no war" or "Ooh, planet. Declare war out of nowhere." The planet screens remind me a lot of MoO or, more accurately, Sid Meier's Colonization town screens. You move your pops, create buildings to increase resource output, and generally try to min/max your tiles. However, 22 years is a long time to leave a concept nearly the same.\n\nCombat, oh combat. If you are coming from EU4/CK2 then combat will probably be a step up. You can customize your ships (a la every 4x space game now), and group them in fleets to attack. However, actual combat is just moving stacks onto eachother, as in EU4. The feedback is fairly minimal, but DOES provide the info to know what major adjustments to your ships you need to make. Minor details about which modules are effective would be helpful.\n\nSo overall opinion: I'm enjoying it. I will spend this week making the galaxy Trump again. However, if you are expecting anything near the polish of EU4, remember what EU4 was like on launch. The DLC and patches for this game will be what really determines how great this game is.\n\nEdit: For clarity, the reason it is not recommended is because this is NOT at the same level of polish and complexity as other Paradox games RIGHT NOW. If you are looking for that, wait a little while. However, for the price, I would still recommend it by itself and I fully believe it will end up surpassing my hours on EU4 (556 and counting) as the free patches and DLC expand the gameplay.\n\nEdit 2 for more clarity: If you are someone who loves the depth and complexity of EU4/CK2, I recommend you wait for some more content to be added. So it's more of a conditional "don't recommend."\n\nThanks for all the feedback!","May 10","false","48.0"," 322 of 559 people (58%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","58","322","559","24","32"

So this game is perfect if you're a 4X or a Grand Strategy fan, because this game is a mix between the two, and I highly recommend this game, and besides, it's pricetag is not the usual $60, but it's actually $40. I'm not very good at explaining games, but I'll give you a little fun story from the game.\n\nSo my science ship was surveying this system and, as it turns out, there was an industrial-age era civilization on one of the planets. This was perfect, since I already colonized a planet on a nearby system, so this planet is in my borders. These guys were the Graxna♥♥♥♥♥n civilization. I decided to send a construction ship there and build an observation post there so the my scinetists can passively study them.\n\nFast-forward 10 years, and I'm in the middle of a war with a neighbor who was a xenophobic fanatic spiritualist, so they basically hate me since my empire is fanatic materialist, the opposite of spiritulist. Anyway, right after a huge battle where half of my ships were destroyed, I get an event of a level 4 class asteroid headed towards the Graxna♥♥♥♥♥n planet. Normally, I would've sent my ships to destroy the asteroid, but my ships were heavily damaged and there was an enemy navy in a system right next to my home system, so I couldn't just go there and destroy it, because then the enemy would attack the capital. Basically, I watched the asteroid slowly encroach on the doomed planet, and the beautiful, jungle planet became a desolate, barren planet, and also got some rings now, like Saturn's rings.\n\nI just watched an entire civilization disappear like that in front of my eyes and I didn't even do anything. For a few minutes, I felt bad for them.

It doesn't feel finished. The game in its current form just doesn't deserve a recommendation, no matter how much I want to give it one.\n\nTo rehash what others have said, the early game is a ton of fun. Your race sets out into the stars, bright-eyed and full of wonder at the vastness of the galaxy. You explore, eagerly finding new anomalies scattered amongst the stars. You find asteroids and planets scattered in the darkness. Eventually, you see a habitable world and with your scientists' valiant contributions, create a colony ship to take your people into a new era. The first weird space faring creatures you see are wonderful and are quickly researched to find out more about them. The first alien race you encounter is a great moment, full of excitement. Then more and more races appear until the galaxy is brimming with life! Then it stops. Nothing happens from this point on. You slowly research technology (very slowly). Spread onto a few new worlds in your territory as your tech progresses. But the universe stops reacting and gives you very few things to do other than try to conquer your neighbour out of boredom.\n\nLater game, a certain event happened in my game that seems like it should be huge. A truly alien danger appears and threatens to overwhelm the entire galaxy. Then it stops too. It sits in its territory doing nothing for literally hundreds of years. As I'd been a wonderful, peace loving race with a very small navy before this, I was sure I would have to battle for my very survival. But nope, just sat in my territory slowly building a massive death fleet with advanced weaponry that wiped out the so called galactic threat system by system through slow chipping away.\n\nAll in all, I don't regret buying it, I got a few hours of fun out of it. And I'm sure that Paradox will do their usual thing and turn this into an amazing game in the future. It isn't there yet though, so it is going back into the library for now until the rest of the game comes along.\n\nI'd save your money until that amazing game is actually finished.","May 20","false","32.2"," 145 of 247 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","145","247","3","0"

I am going to say no but just barely.\n\nGood: Great early to mid game.  The best "sim" aspect of any 4x space game.  Micro-managers wet dream.\n\nBad:\n\n1. Diplomacy is horrific.  Early to mid it is worthless.  Late it is nearly impossible move a faction one way or another.\n2. Combat is very simply early to mid almost so much so that it is boring.  Late combat is nearly impossible.  During the late stages when you have 10+ core sectors and you are part of a federation your navy is huge.  Probably around 50k+.  If your federation fights another alliance/federation that is of equil footing, just forget it.  You will get plastered.  Not because their fleet is bigger but because the computer just moves faster.  Not just thinking, their ships just move faster.  Now you might be thinking that is why my computer allies are for right?  Wrong.  Your computer allies does basically one thing when you as a federation/alliance go to war.  They all come to your biggest fleet and just follow you around.  I don't know if that is design flaw or intention but it sucks.  The computer fed/alliance is sending ships to like 10 to 15 systems all in small batches with landing forces.  As soon as they see your big fleet they jump and scatter.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to catch them.  I believe the intention to this tactic was to promote defense stations as they have FTL scramblers.  But at this stage a fleet that huge will blast that station and when your bigger fleet pops in will run and scatter.  Super frustrating.  It is an impossible endeavor to protect a large empire.\n3. You cannot win a large map.  Victory conditions are 40% of inhabitable planets or complete domination.  600 stars = forever to conquer 40% let alone complete domination.  Even if this was doable (and I suppose several months of play time and you theoretically good) the combat system makes it impossible.  One big war and you are done.  There is no coming back from that.  The war will last forever because of their "warscore" method.  It would be an insanely long war.\n\nI know this sounds pretty bad.  I am bit emotional because I just had my long game just get wrecked due to the combat system.  It is a great game, but right now they need to address some key late game issues.\n\nIf you have the money try it out.  If you are a little tight on funds wait a few months.","May 27","false","167.0"," 65 of 105 people (62%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","62","65","105","7","1"

The game is competent, but uninspired. I don't regret buying it, and maybe it'll have a chance to come great with a bunch of patches and the obligatory DLC, but the game does nothing to overcome the mid to end game grind typical of the genre.\n\nI've played 25 hours of Stellaris and restarted three or four times. Each time I expanded for around 6-10 hours or so with little in the way of competition, then started a completely unnecessary war out of sheer boredom. After either winning or stalemating the war, I looked around and observed that at the same rate I had at least another 6-10 hours of the same before hitting anything approximating a win condition. At this point I deleted my save game and started again.\n\nThe game’s big selling point, the supposed ‘stories’ that mix things up and make every game different, weren’t particularly obvious to me. My first game did result in an event where my civilization immediately spawned a 'splinter group' (basically, pirates). This ended up nerfing my start, but other than that I hunted them down and killed them, ending that particular story line. Every other game has largely followed the same trajectory, minus the initial rebellion.\n\nMostly, the same half dozen mini-missions (research anomalies) appear in regular rotation - ancient graffiti, ruined ancient organic star ship, ancient comet crashing into a planet, etc. Meh.\n\nThe other civilizations are all generic, and I regret my impulse preorder purchase to get a few more ‘cosmetic’ options for the other races in the galaxy (different portraits). These portraits don’t spend enough time on my screen for them to even register.\n\nAs far as emergent events are concerned numerous games do it far better. Spore’s end-game for one. Not to mention related procedurally generated SF ARPGs such as SPAZ and Space Rangers 2, where you can genuinely feel the life of the galaxy going on around you. In Stellaris, unfortunately, the universe feels almost entirely static and empty.\n\nTo finish on a few specifics, 75% of the gameplay seems to be micromanaging scout ships exploring and constructors building mines and research outposts, even into the late mid-game. There are no unit automation options, such as Civ's autoexplore and autoimprove, which is probably intentional since eliminating these two options would obviously also eliminate 75% of the gameplay.\n\nShip design feels like an add-on. Basically, research bigger ship size, maximise ship design for dps, research for a bigger ship size again… rinse and repeat.\n\nUltimately, playing on a sparse star field has little of the charm of Civ's changing geographies. In the absence of the buzz associated with discovering new coastlines, mountain ranges, swamps, rivers and cities, a space 4X really needs to offer something else. Stellaris promised to add that interest with its emergent storytelling. Sadly, with the game in its current empty state I’m not seeing it at the moment.","May 20","true","26.3"," 94 of 157 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","94","157","3","2"

It has some interesting things to say about the 4x model and correctly approaches the many pitfalls that other games just like it have failed at.  In the end it also has a good price-point, which talks to me about the thought put into addressing it's audience.\n\nO.K.  The good, the bad and the ugly:\n\nGood: It has intricate depth to almost all aspects of the game.  Once you think you have figured something out, you quickly find out that there is much much more.  The sound track is REALLY good.  The AI does not simply focus on KILL KILL KILL. They act appropriate to their civ traits and tech levels (shocker).  It's really a very pretty game.\n\nBad:  The AI that "auto-designs" your space fleet is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible and, until I figured out what was going on, I lost like 4 or 5 games to crazy inferior civs because of it.  The UI needs some tweeking (for example: there are moons that you need to click on sometimes that are so small that you have to barely adjust your mouse this way or that in order to click it... very dumb).  The tutorial for the game does a farely decent job at addressing the basics like what one interface or another is for, but does nothing for others.  Additionally, there are entire aspects of the game that could use SOME sort of information, but has none to offer.  In some way this lends to an atmosphere of mystery, but some people would just call this poor game design.\n\nThe inbetween:  The tech tree is non-existant.  In lue of this basic 4x concept the game uses a new and interesting mechanic that the game designers call a sort of semi-random lottery.  You draw 3 random techs from the pool of possible techs every time you start a new game or finish researching a technology.  It's really interesting to be sure, but semi-frustrating because I have no idea what the technologies are that are possible.  My initial frustration was that I couldn't make a plan... like in CIV 5 for example.  In Civ 5 I look at the tech tree and look at what resources are available and make a plan that involves my ersearch path and the units I build to take advantage of available materials around my cities.  After playin about 15 games now I can tell you that I really like the way Stellaris does this.  I'm sure that the developers looked at this and called it a risk, but in the end I think it's something unique... a risk in game design that has payed off.\n\nThe ugly:  Fleet battles in Stellaris are sure pretty, but unlike a game like Sins of a Solar Empire that absolutely hit the concept of "Fleet Battles" out of the ♥♥♥♥ing park home-run style... Stellaris really just failed.  Once a battle begins you have NO ♥♥♥♥ing control over it what-so-♥♥♥♥ing-ever.  You can't, for example, force a singular ship that is being focused by the other fleet to retreat.  There is only one ♥♥♥♥ing thing you can ♥♥♥♥-all do once combat begins: force the entire fleet to retreat... and oddly enough there is a random trait that fleet leaders can develop after retreating that disable even that small piece of control. SO. ♥♥♥♥ING. FRUSTRATING.\n\nSo all that said I think that if you like games like CIV 5, Gal Civ, Sins or any 4x like that, then you should certainly check this game out.  I'm still having a lot of fun with it.","May 13","true","63.5"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","31","45","0","0"

Resources were scarce and i felt compelled to move out into the galaxy (get more energy, always more energy)\nI did probably start with a galaxy that was to big (800 systems and alot of ai races) This meant i had quite a bit of growing to do before i hit the borders of another faction (so no need to fight or compete with anyone else early)\nThe different races also prefer different planets wich is cool, but kinda kept the competition low since i was one of the only races who went for continental planets.\n\nAnyway i got to the mid game without any problems, with only a few races ahed of me in power/tech.\nI had a nice big empire around 15planets and all the resources i could need, and here lies the problem.. Since i have all that i need to reserch new tech, feed my navies and so forth, what reason do i have to go to war? Or trade?\nNone :p There is absolutley nothing to do....\nIve been in two wars sofar!\nWith the first being initiated by me on this bird race who hated me from the start, those xenophobic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\nThey were ahed of me in fleet size and fleet tech. No need to worry, i got my ally involved and he helped me make a bigger blob of ships equal to 10k power, vs the enemy 6k.\nNeedless to say the war lasted for 1battle and a few planetary assults.\nSince their navy was dead there was no opposition and i was just running around with transports(boring)\nEventually another empire decleared war on them sensing weakness and the cowardly birds sued for peace. Now this was a big(ish) empire but i could instantly make them a vassal + release part of their empire, who later joined my alliance..\n\nThe second war was initiated by my ally vs another xenophobic reptilian race who had rivaled both of us and had a big border vs my ally.\nAgain my ally sent their entire fleet to me so to make the biggest blorg (blob) and whack the enemy fleet out of the game in 2battles (fun right?)\nNow here i have two gripes:\n1: Why do i need to lead the ai fleets around?? I had NO stake in that war and only wanted to give token support to my ally.. But he refused to do ANYTHING on his own :p I tried parking my fleet around my homeworld and he just sat there while the enemy burned his worlds.\nFinally i caved and sent our blob of death to the enemy homeworld. That got his intention and he sent his fleet to defend.. This was the only reason i went deep into his empire, I wanted to face his fleet and autowin the war (fun right?) The battle system in crusader kings have more depth then this!!\nIm sorry to say: The combat, it just sucks.... :o\nI cant describe the lack of satisfaction in fighting wars like this :(\n\n1: The game lacks depth, plain and simple.. I am used to more from paradox and i dont know why they went in this direction\n\n2: You can probably optimise your empire way better then i did..\nBut why care? When i got everything i needed by uppgrading powerplans/mines. Maybe its different on smaller maps? Then again, i diddentt want to play smaller maps :p\n\n3: Diplomacy and trade: Its lacking depth, its lacking function (as in: i need x from you, here take my y) Ive had very little meaningfull trade deals (research deals being one) Just to give one example: The ai i made into a vassall hate me. They are disloyal, and still when the second war came, they were there fighting by my side with the few ships they had managed to rebuild :p\nThey hate me, but has no problems dying for me?\nAlliances are meaningfull i guess, and i havent tried federation yet.\n\n4: Resources: There are special resources that can be used to improve certain things: happiness, better powerplant, weapons and whatnot, but i never feel like a need them! My needs are already met within my empire.\n\n5: Population: I dont know if this is broken, but all pops are loyalists. No other faction exsist. I have several sectors, though i do not allow other empires migration rights. Not sure whats supposed to trigger other factions.\n\n6: My population does not seem unhappy, like ever. Ive not made any happiness buildings in my empire (i am at the battleship phase) and i can detect no negative effects.. Or if there are, they are not severe enough for me to care.\n\n7: It does not feel like grand strategy.. It feels like most of the other 4x games recently, but in real time and with less depth.\n\n8: Information: I struggle to keep track of the relations between other empires. Who are friends and who are enemies. I have a few enemies (as in ppl who hate me) but i have no reason to care :p I made a vassal out of one of the bigger empires in my part of the map and the other guys did nothing. I got no worried diplomats at my door, no federations (just leagues or anything like that) to curtail my aggression! They probably hate me a bit more but who cares? :p I did see my ally had some negative points vs me due to terror bombings\nI bombed enemy planets? Arent you supposed to do that to reduce fortifications? ^^ I even used the least aggressive stance!\n\nIve had 20hours playing this game, and i am bored :(\nIve never been bored in a paradox game before, and i play most of them: Europa universalis, Hearts of Iron, Crusader kings, Victoria...\nIt may be a good starting point for someone new to paradox, to ease them into a game without to much to worry about. But i cant recomend it to veterans of paradox games.\nOr even anyone who are used to games like civilizations, or even realtime strategy games.\nThe realtime combat makes you want controll, but the game just wont let you.\n\nI was so hyped for this, and now i am heartbroken. This was supposed to rekindle my love for the 4x genra and keep me playing for years(like victoria 2, crusader kings + +) and help me while waiting for Hearts of iron and Totalwar warhammer.\n\nOhwell, back to viking conquest i guess </3\n:/","May 11","false","30.4"," 41 of 63 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","41","63","2","8"

Not yet.\n\nIt starts out great. The race creator is great. The galaxy is beautiful, as is the music. Exploring planets and discovering things is really fun. It looks and plays like a great game. Then it grinds to a screeching halt.\n\nPlenty of promised features are absolute bare bones. There are, for example, very few diplomatic options compared to other Paradox games - mostly standard 4X stuff like declaring war, trading for resources, border access, etc. It could have been enough if half of this stuff wasn't broken . For example, you can't ask for civilian or military access if your borders don't touch, which means you can get blocked off by the AI and can't even remedy this short of going to war.\n\nIt's still better than the state of some other features. Sectors? They barely build anything, don't clear tile blockers, destroy strategic resources to build a Hydroponic Farm. Federations? Just a super-alliance witht he ability to build an additional fleet which counts towards the Presidents naval limit (so the AI will disband it as soon as it takes over). Internal politics? For 53 years I didn't even see a faction appearing, let alone a rebellion.\n\nThe AI also isn't anything to write home about. It used to have problem with expanding, though this seems to have been fixed in a beta patch. Still, it's pretty passive and content to leave you alone in your corner of the galaxy (unless it's some hyperaggressive personality). Sometimes it definitely has problems with waging war - when my enemy finally decided to crush me, they just flew their ships through all my systems then disappeared somewhere and didn't react as I bombarded one of their worlds into oblivion. Your allies and vassals just follow your main fleet, not even defending their core worlds when attacked.\n\nAnd holy ♥♥♥♥, the lack of polish is glaring. I already wrote about broken sectors, which is compounded by the fact the game won't let you micromanage them and wants you to pay Influence just for taking a planet out. When the AI demands a planet as a wargoal and someone else takes it, it will never end the war. There is no automatic survey, you're supposed to click on every star you want to check out.  At least one late game crisis is impossible to be resolved because of broken triggers. There are plenty of examples where the game could have used more testing.\n\nDon't expect another CK2 - currently it's more like Sengoku,","May 12","false","9.5"," 45 of 71 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","45","71","0","0"

It's very much like that pretty girl from the store you really like. You woo her and it starts off very fun, but after spending an evening with her she gets on your nerves and turns out to be extremely high maintenance.\n\nEverything starts quite well, with an expansive customization of your empire, where you choose government form, ethics and starting technologies. The early game is definitely the best part of Stellaris: It has a lot of exploration, quests and interesting choices concerning your research and expansion.\n\nThis quickly turns around as you move into the midgame though. Quests dry up quickly, exploration comes to a full stop as you run into the borders of alien empires, and it turns out that where you expand to does not matter, as long as you do it quickly and grab as much stuff as you can. The where and how is not that important for a few reasons:\n- The important resources, namely Energy and Minerals, can be gathered anywhere.\n- The strategic resources are not very relevant.\n\nTo prevent you from becoming too powerful too quickly, Stellaris forces you to give up control of planets beyond the 5th. All extra planets must be put in Sectors, which are AI controlled regions. When asking Merni (a developer) on Twitter, she said that the main purpose of Sectors was to reduce micromangement.\nThis is not true. Not only do they increase micromanagement, as I will explain below, but there are techs and government forms that allow you to get player control over more of them. Meaning that it is seen as a direct bonus to be able to control them.\n\nWhat is bad about sectors ? Well, here is a short list of problems:\n- The AI is incompetent in managing their planets\n- Sectors require resources to build up and then pay a tax (percentage of their income). The problem here is: they also stockpile resources that become inaccessible to you, and you have to constantly check if they need resources.\n- You constantly have to check what they are doing and sometimes manually correct this\n- Managing a planet in a sector requires something like 12 clicks.\n- If you build a colony ship in a sector, it won't show up in your ship list. So you have to constantly check the map/systems\n- You can only put an entire starsystem in a sector, not individual planets. So, if you have a system with 4 habitable worlds, of which you want to manage 1 because it's great, well that's too bad, you are screwed.\n- You don't get quests for planets in sectors\n- You don't get to do observation of lesser races in sectors, or at least don't get proper alerts for it\n- Changing sectors costs influence, a rare resource. You can accidently, due to bad interface, burn through all your influence this way.\n- In short, sectors cause a huge headache and an overwhelming amount of micromanagement, all just to screw over the player\n\nQuests are another major annoyance. It all starts well, and the stories around them are pretty good. Unfortunately the quests are very shallow, and are almost exclusively: bring a science ship, and use the clicky. Unlike in a game like Civilization V for example, where City State quests require a lot of diferent types of things: gathering a resource, trading for a luxury, trying to get techs, a wonder, explore, kill barbarians... There is none of that here. The only quest you will get in this game is: Use the clicky, or spend some science points.\nYou will also start seeing repeat quests very quickly, likely within your very first game. As said above, sectors do not seem to provide quests properly. Maybe it's a bug, more likely it's a badly thought out feature.\n\nFinally we come to the cluster♥♥♥♥ that is combat. There is a lot to go through here so lets get started with minor stuff:\n- Land invasions are completely non-interactive. This is a lot worse than EU4, you just click and then well, wait.\n- Land units can be equipped with an improvement. Except, no one tells you this, and there is no icon or link that gives an indication this is possible, you just have to find out.\n- Land units have to be transported in ultravulnerable ships, you can't just have them on board of your fleet. It's just another headache.\n- Space battles are completely non-interactive. Not only that, but your ships will actively pursue mining stations during a fleet battle for example, which can completely screw you over.\n- Space battles starting in the mid game hog so much resources that it slows down (and possibly overheats) your pc.\n- Most wars are determined in a single battle. While a player might be able to trap the AI's fleet through elaborate schemes in order to rebuild, the AI cannot do this. This means that if the AI engages you with an insufficiently big stack, it's dead and you just won the war as recovery is impossible\n- Space wars are annoying, it's a lot of avoiding eachother since the bigger stack will almost always win, unless you built your fleet entirely wrong.\n- Fleets can get stuck in situations of indecision, when they are floating between two equally attractive targets. They can also get stuck at long range without ever moving close enough to use their weapons.\n- Fleets can get stuck in separate parts of your empire after a peace treaty, as you have no control over where they go after a war ends. They just go "somewhere".\n- Interface is horrible when trying to manage multiple ships and/or fleets\n\nThe final pillar of the game, Science, starts as a very interesting novelty where you can choose from several different techs each time. While this is certainly an innovation, the randomness can completely screw you over, there is no in-game tech tree to see what you need for what.\nFurthermore, you quickly run out of techs around the midgame, and everything you get after that is small passive bonuses. The "dangerous" late game techs provide only small advantages so they are not actually worth researching, and it's not incremental slippery slope deal either.\nAside of that, there are very, very few techs that offer interesting new things other than small upgrades to your ship tech. All interesting techs are in Societal research, where you unlock uplifting and genetic modifications.\nNow, I'm not opposed to the idea of unlocking small upgrades, but there is nothing else to teching up. There are no wonders in this game, and very few unique things.\nThis leads to it all feeling very much the same. To the point even where at one point, a single techs unlocks 2 tiers (!!) of the same upgrade.\n\nThat brings us to the end of this complaint/review, with some loose comments:\n- There is no trade\n- There is no espionage\n- The diplomacy is extremely shallow compared to EU4\n- There are no luxuries and strategic resources are irrelevant\n- The only victory conditions are either conquering everyone, or having 40% of the planets. There are no peaceful victories\n- AI's will not actively pursue victory, they just hang around and don't do anything goal oriented.\n- Talking about AI's: if you have allies or vassals in a war, they will do nothing (!!). They will just put their fleets on follow of your largest active fleet. So if your biggest fleet is in part A of the galaxy, and your invasion fleet is in part B and needs help... tough luck !\n- I "won" 10 hours into my campaign, but needed 40 more to actually get to the victory screen. Once you snowball, unless you are stupid, nothing will be able to stop you. This becomes boring and tedious really fast.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nWhile this game looks good and starts of fine, it quickly becomes an overwhelming amount of micromanagement with very little strategy involved. This game will need several expansions before it gets really good, and will end up being a 100 € game before it's really enjoyable.","May 16","false","138.4"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","28","41","0","1"

If a game is a series of interesting choices, then this is not a game. Every part of it, from building and colonizing planets, to exploration, to combat, feels rote and superficial. You simply set up stations near resources, upgrade your level 2 mines to level 3 mines, build more corvettes, and wait for the queues to finish.\n\nCombat is laughable, even after this recent patch. There's no reason to build anything other than corvettes, the basic ship. Tech upon tech adds complexity in the form of military stations, defense platforms, larger ships, etc, all of which are fairly useless. You simply build a corvette swarm, click on the enemy, wait for them to explode. Whee.\n\nOther empires look fun, but are basically identical, with ethics providing a thin veneer of personality. Think Civ 5 AI, but without unique abilities, aggression, or anything else worth talking about.\n\nA lot of hype was built around anomalies and exploration, but 90% of the anomalies I found simply unlocked a resource or gave me a research boost. No choices, nothing interesting. Even the flavor text was repetitive by my second game.\n\nUltimately, this has the depth of a $5-10 strategy game, with the blatant intention of filling in the gaping chasms with paid DLC and expansions. I feel conned out of my $40.","May 25","false","22.0"," 39 of 61 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","39","61","0","0"

This game has compelled me to do so. What an absolutely fantastic game it is. I have never been much of a 4x player or a grand strategy fan in the past, but something told me to pick this one up. Man am I glad I did. Stellaris really captures the feel of role playing a galactic empire. From the ethics and traits, to diplomacy and trade. To combat and wars. Each game takes hours and hours to complete. I'm currently on my 14th hour of the current game and have plenty more to go.\nThe fact that you can completely customize your starting race, complete with ethics and traits, and the fact that AI species are all completely randomly generated is what makes this really shine. Also, you can design your own ships with the technology you have researched. Awesome idea.\nThe only thing that has bugged me a bit, is the UI needs an overhaul. There are many areas where efficiency can really be improved when managing a lot of fleets and planets.\n\nIf you're a fan of space, and feel like ruling the galaxy, pick this game up.

It is easy to get into as you start with just one planet and build your empire slowly from scratch.  I found myself immersed in it quickly.\n\nI have not gotten very far into it yet, as all the choices you have to create your race, planet, government, galaxy, etc. can take you quite a while.  I then played on slow speed quite a bit just looking around the galaxy and watching the ships, etc. do their thing.  It is real time, not turn based, but there are 5 different speed settings and you can also pause anytime you wish and still issue orders.  You can play it as fast or as slow and casual as you wish.\n\nThe eXploring, eXpanding, and eXploiting are fairly standard, but made more interesting with good writing with the random events that pop up, and they are plentifiul.   I haven't done too much eXterminating yet except for some pirates.  Combat is graphically nicely displayed, but it is auto-resolved.  As others have said, you are the emperor, not the admiral.\n\nGame has run smooth for me, although it did seriously heat up my computer,  Sometimes happens with my setup, not just with this game, and the usual fix of limiting the game to 60fps worked to fix the issue.\n\nI'll update if necessary once I get more into mid to late game, but so far I can see putting a lot of hours into this one and it is well worth it.\n\n","May 10","true","29.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

It's perhaps the first strategy game I have played in a very long time. When I was younger, Command & Conquer games were some of my favorites and also Age of Empires, but during the years I jumped into different genres I guess. I haven't played Paradox's earlier games much at all, but I absolutely love Stellaris.\n\nIn Stellaris, your goal is to build a galactic empire. When you start the game, you have the option of choosing from about 8 pre-defined species to start your journey as. Or you can completely create your own species, which I enjoy doing. There's about 6 species groups and 60-70 different species to choose from, home planet type, design of your ships/buildings, your traits that define your race. Like breeding speed, are they militaristic empire or peaceful ones. I maybe used one hour on first time to design my Fox people. It's really fun :).\n\nBefore starting game, you get to choose the galaxy size, galaxy shape from few options, AI opponent amount etc. Max amount of stars currently is 1000 and it is huge!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685944206\nAnyway, there are a lot of things you get to customize before you begin conquest. Also there is a thing called "Iron Man" mode, which I didn't realize to put on first. It's like a hard more and you only have one save game, the auto save. So there is no returning back from mistakes. It also enables achievements.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and there are a lot of things to learn. It's just a pure joy watching the solar systems, exploring new areas and slowly spreading your empire. It can feel overwhelming first. The kind of slow pace in this game is great. You will encounter many new species and will they be your enemy or friend, that is up to you.\nCombat isn't very detailed, but that is okey. The tutorial also for is good and the AI-voice helps a lot along the way if you choose so.\n\nMultiplayer is sweet. Friends can join your game and take control of one AI species, so you can conquer the galaxy together. Or you can start a new game completely.\n\nSoundtrack of Stellaris is quite epic and it's very enjoyable to listen to while exploring. OST  reminds me of movies like Interstellar and Tron Legacy or games like Mass Effect and Deus Ex:Human Revolution. So fans of those will surely love it. A good music is important with a long game like this in my opinion.\n\nAnyone who loves sci-fi and strategy genre, pick this game up. You will maybe like Stellaris too. I can imagine spending hundreds of hours with this. I'd play it non-stop if I only didn't have so many other games to play too.\nIt's a stellar experience.","May 22","true","23.3"," 108 of 187 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","108","187","4","0"

On the surface it appears to be a simple space rts, but give it a few hours and the game opens up into something huge and exciting. The customisation options are impressive, the graphics are beautiful, the performance is as smooth as butter and the overall polish for a release day game is very high compared to what we are used to nowadays. Yes, it has a few things that could be improved in terms of information feedback and map overlays, but these in no way fully detract from what is a superb game. I am also excited about future dlc that Paradox will no doubt release to take this already addictive game to the next level.  And no, I'm not a Paradox fan boy who buys or supports dlc just for the sake of it. I simply don't mind paying for something that is worth it, and more often that not, Paradox deliver - simple as.\n\nOn the whole, I would recommend this game to anyone with even the slightest interest in rts space games.

But I could not honestly play past 2 hours per session, out of sheer boredom. This review will explain why to all the people who dismiss me as being too attached to EU4.\n\n1. The economy mechanics.\nThey are boring, nonintuitive, clicky, nondynamic, and simple- in a bad way. The system is based off of buildings you make which give you a flat increase of income a turn. Personally, this "+1 plot" system is not what I expected from Paradox. Paradox has been known for their complex economic systems- Trade in EU4, Production in Victoria and HOI, and feudal taxes in Crusader Kings. Seeing that Stellaris doesn't even have a trade mechanic, which I feel is a lost opportunity here, when dynamic trade nodes would be *such* a great addition to the game. Instead, they decide to completely remove one of the greatest features of a Grand Strategy game in this '4x/Grand Strategy hybrid' under the justification of 'keeping it simple'. I would argue that there is a difference between keeping it simple, and not even including an important mechanic.\n\n2.The warfare mechanics.\nThey are boring, nonintuitive, spamfesty, and carry very little player interaction. "Designing your own ships" is about as useful or rewarding as adding a paper sticker onto a cup and calling it a 'design'; it has little to no impact on anything, as the game already appears to have the most proficient design ready for you anyway. Not that designs really make a difference either, as the battle is based on sheer numbers; mainly two. Armor, and armor penetration. There is no maneuvering going on here, there is no composition or 'specialization' that is effective here. I cannot heavily comment on this personally, but I do believe that even those who enjoy this game criticise the warfare mechanics.\n\n3. The Diplomacy mechanics.\nNonexistant. Besides the cosmetics, the diplomacy mechanics are only *just a tad better* than civilization's. I'll just quote the Wiki on the features:\n\n-Establishing an embassy to improve relations with an AI nation (embassies have no effect in a multiplayer game if established between two human players)\n-Sending an insult to reduce relations\n-Offering an alliance (a strong alliance with 4 or more participants may become a Federation)\n-Offering a trade agreement (trade agreements can include non-aggression pacts, map-sharing, resources, research access, -border access, and migration between nations)\n-Demanding a weaker AI enemy becomes your vassal\n-Declaring war\n-Declaring another nation your rival (resulting in both parties gaining Influence)\n\nSimplistic, alright.\n\n4. DLC Platform\n\nI will never understand how people will conform to companies shoving out such a minimal game and charging full price for it on the grounds that 'they'll fill out the holes with expansions later!'. People should not allow themselves to be continuously abused with DLC containing content that should have been in the base game.\n\n","May 12","false","17.4"," 86 of 148 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","86","148","6","18"

The races are well designed, and researchable technologies are more or less scientifically realistic. The 3 different FTL technologies give a nice strategic depth to the game, which can also be at times frustrating.\n\nThe game lacks diplomatic relation mechanisms. It is hard to see or understand why some races attack you.  Even playing passively your neighbors randomly declare war on you. Trying to gain an ally is often hindered by missing a few positive relation points with no way to gain further points. Often I ended up as a strong lonely nation that gets beaten down by strong alliances. If I finally manage to gain an alliance friend, I get a declaration of war by some other alliance further away that somehow manages to pass through occupied space to invade my planets. I am sure this can be understood after a certain amount of play time, still the different map overviews in EU4 were a lot easier to analyze. Here are none.\n\nFurther the AI tends to create many small fleets. Fighting 2 nations with different FTLs at the same time, each of them having 5-6 perfectly micromanaged fleets, while you are trying to send your 2-3 larger fleets defending your empire is rather annoying. Not to mention, bigger fights even bring the best PCs to its knees with 2-3 FPS. The CPU just can’t keep up.\n\nThe early game has been nicely polished and gives a positive playing experience. The further you get into the game, the more unfinished elements appear. The game just got released to early and seems unfinished.

It' just lacks depth, and the implementation is just not there for me.","May 11","false","19.6"," 88 of 154 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","88","154","5","0"

Its a slow game but you feel like you don't necessarily have enough time to do what you want to do. You constantly have to choose between resources and what to spend them on. The "small" universes have 100 solar systems and take days to complete. This game manages to keep you at a strategic level with micromanagement minimized to a perfection.\n\nFrom the time I have played it seems to have a lot of replaybilty, not only because games will take days to complete but everything from what I have seen is procedurally built. You are not going to have the same game twice, they might be similar but one time you might start in a resource poor solar system all alone and your fighting to just survive, the next time your in a solar system that is rich in resources and eveyone wants to get you. Even the tech tree has randomness to it, not to the extent of you have no idea what you will unlock but it seems that once you research 1 item it unlocks a few from the next level, this prevents you from knowing the future.\n\n\n\n\n","May 11","true","20.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

In the end it completely screws up in too many ways to where it's a tedious grind. In the end I wish I did not buy this game at 25% off for $30.  So how does this game mess up? I will tell you about some things you need to look up:\n\n-War Score System: You have to declare up to a few planets as your goal, then after you take them you cannot fight the enemy empire in any way no matter what due to an end of war treaty that lasts 10 years. Basically you can be 1 planet shy of defeating an enemy and it gives them a 10 year cooldown.\n\n-The populations you conquer are never happy. NEVER. They will rebel. Destroy buildings. Production of their resources is cut in half if they even produce resources. The planet you just took is useless. This can be fixed with purging, but you must be a collectivist (communist) or xenophobic empire to do so and it will anger all other alien races at you. So if you want to conquer people you cannot make peace with anyone.\n\n-Even if you purge the populace and get a planet under control you cannot control more than 5 or so planets at a time. The game will then force a harsh penalty for governing so many planets. The only way to take away this penalty is to draw off sectors on a map and have all planets in that sector automated. This. Is. Stupid. You cannot build what you want,  the AI is incompetent, and upgrades and improvements to your planets just DO. NOT. HAPPEN. So basically for most governments you can have 5 planets you can control and once they are maxed out the rest of your planets have to be automated and turned into giant paperweights.\n\n-Needing influence to make frontier stations to expand borders just so you can mine empty planets with resources. Influence grows way too slowly for established planets. Your borders are literally static, and each frontier outpost puts a -1 modifier on your influence income. Influence is used for lots of things, so if you expand your borders guess what? You cannot afford new leaders and certain edicts like managing rebellious factions in your empire. Even some buildings cost influence.\n\n-The game in general punishes expansion and growth. Stellaris HARSHLY PUNISHES MILITARY CONQUEST. The devs literally are trying to force you to be peaceful with at least most of your neighbors or else you are stuck. Conquered planets are nigh useless with their native populations, you cannot bomb the populations to death from orbit and re-colonize it yourself, there is literally no friggin way to win with warfare in this game. There just isn't. The rebellious factions cause more issues than they are worth and demand to be returned to an empire you conquer and defeated 50 years ago. And the moment they have freedom? I declare war on them, steamroll them again with superior fleet, the whole rebellion until we get our freedom thing happens again. THIS IS VERY STUPID.  You can't even land armies to use as police units to ensure the populace at least let your buildings function.\n\n-Broken mechanics on planet control. You have major efficiency debuffs for having more than 5-7 planets pending government type. You split up planets you own into sectors then. How does this make sense forcing you to automate planets? You can take 20+ planets and make them into one giant sector under control of one governor and HE doesn't get any debuffs, does he? The devs intended for multiple sectors but the system is flawed and broken, especially since the AI controlled planets don't utilize resources properly. I cannot emphasize that enough, even if you order them to respect natural tile resources they ignore it and put down a lab. The sector hoards it's own resources seperate from you, too. So while a giant mega-sector can have more resources than you the guy in charge of the empire, you still have to buy ships and pay for maintenance on them. Make sense yet? Nope, never does never will.\n\nSummary: Broken mechanics were ripped from other Paradox games and shoehorned in, in a very awkward manner. There are even complaints from some long-time Paradox fans that some of the mechanics just don't make sense in this game. War score makes no sense in the galactic scale, might have worked for European wars in EU4 but that and all the other non-sense in Stellaris just makes no sense. It kills immersion and drags the game down in a bad way.\n\n\nThere is a lot more wrong with this game. I might edit and update later, but in general this is not worth the effort. A fanboy will not get to this point before down-voting my review, so why keep explaining? There are many flaws to the logic in this game, from army transports all the way down to integrating aliens into your society. This is my first jump into a Paradox strategy game and I'm massively disappointed. Yes, they traded the icky historical theme for a cool sci-fi theme. That is a great step. But seriously, the devs put so many disincentives into the game that you are forced to play a certain way or else your empire will be crippled. We haven't had any good 4x space games since Space Empires 4 + 5. Stellaris did not fill that niche, in fact it's a pro-peace panzy ripoff of Distant Worlds. If you want 4x in RTS format get Distant Worlds: Universe instead. I know, the price sucks. There are rare sales, but it's worth full price. Stellaris loses compared to DW:U in every gameplay aspect.","May 15","false","16.9"," 33 of 53 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","33","53","0","1"

Very boring.\n\nYou start off exploring the galaxy and that part is fun. But, fairly soon, you've finished that part of the game and you're into the part of the game where you're developing your star civilization. And there's nothing to do there. You get to make meaningless choices between technologies with futuristic-sounding names, and watch the AI develop the planets that you've colonized. And this goes on for hours and hours and hours. I've read that there's an epic war at the end of the game, but I've only played the game for about 100 hours, I haven't got that far yet.\n\nThere's a tile development mini-game within a game, as is traditional for Civilization-like games, but the developers decided to force you to let the AI do that for you. I don't know why the game's designers bothered to code this mini-game if they weren't going to let the players play it.\n\nWars with the AI are boring. You don't fight the battles yourself - that's all handled by the AI. You move your star ship fleets around on the map, trying to bring the AI to battle on your terms. If your fleet is bigger, chances are that'll be relatively easy. Then you get to watch the AI for your fleet ROFLstomp the AI for the AI's fleet. It's pretty the first few times, but after a while it gets old.\n\nIn fairness, the developers have said that there's a whole bunch of mid-game events that they didn't have time to code before releasing the game. They've said they expect to get that code added to the game by the end of June. We'll see. But in the meantime, if you like watching the AI play against itself, this is the game for you.","May 28","false","129.9"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","17","24","2","0"

Already played through on hardest and managed to dominate the AI while making numerous errors and being essentially stuck and unable to colonize in the early mid-game. I was hoping for a EUIV in space. You have a force-limit, you have to have a CB to attack regions of space etc. etc. This game is like every other 4X game. In-fact it is a step back to something like the still unsurpassed Distant Worlds for the sake of this review I am going to compare it to such:\n\nedit: Finally ran into all of the BUGS: I have had the AI send a 5k stack of ships one at a time instead of a fleet across my sector. I have zoomed into a fight and then zoomed out to the map only to have a destroyed battleship replace the stars in the background as well as numerous graphical glitches. The save/load broke where when I loaded a game it would take me to empty space with nothing in it, losing me hours of progress. I have had a fleet stuck, unable to decide between two starbase on which one to attack and just flying in circles. Not to mention that wormholes are broken with allies.\n\n- The world is lifeless. Distant worlds had a public and a private sector so you could see public sector ships flying through space, grabbing resources and hauling them back to the colony. None of that here. You build a science or mineral outpost and thats it.\n\n- The ship building is also useless. The modules are boring as all hell: you just have laser I then 2 etc. Why even customize the ships. In distant worlds, you had complete freedom to add modules to the ship up to their limit. You could make ships as small or as large as you like. Star Drive also had an inovative system where you can places modules on a grid. Even Gal Civ 4 allowed you to customize the look of the ships.\n\n- Colony management is still in the dark ages: Blockers!? Adjecency bonuses. These are all tired, worn concepts. Dumping everything into sectors just to get rid of the tedium is not a solution! Sectors should be the primary means of control, not systems.\n\n- Diplomacy, what diplomacy: On Hard and up, it is extremely difficult to get alliances or form federations so that mechanic is all but wiped out. Federation 10 year time, puff puff pass mechanic, is silly anyway. They built a game like CK2 where you could have a family, a lineage, gain and lose huge regions of land in one generation and here we are back with the staid governors etc. What a waste.\n\n(protip: Built massive amounts of mineral resources. Don't focus on energy. Befriend another empire who also gets massive energy reserves that they do not use and keep trading minerals for energy and win. Pro-er tip: you cannot run into debt so in the end retool everything to minerals and WIN with your massive 200k Doom stacks. Energy maintenance, WTF is that. I used the red shard tech as my only offensive tech and won. Battleship? More like here comes 50 corvettes up your ♥♥♥, all evading your shots.) The game is broken as is. But maybe in some magical future world, Paradox carves it into a gem. I live in the present. I don't live in the "What if they..."\n\n-Distant worlds you could get creamed by pirates, massive alliances, late game invasions. Here, you have terrible Ai to deal with who never attack you as well as a few roaming monsters that do nothing until you attack them.\nIt gets worse: If the AI were to become super agressive, you would be all but wiped out because of the bonuses they receive. I have a feeling this is why you are never engaged. It would make the game unplayable on harder difficulties.\n\nEdit: The AI is even worse than I thought, which explains their passive nature: My vassel was declared on by a large empire. They took ages to finally move their superior fleet into my territory, while I huddled my ships in a corner, waiting for the end. They proceeded to attack my home world, destroy the station, then they !split! their fleet with one half buggering off to some distant corner of my empire and the other being immediately ambushed by my fleet and destroyed. A further note: while most 4X titles have some kind of limitation on the range of your ships i.e. Distant Worlds has fuel, this game allows you to just hop to ends of the universe. Effectively making wars highly one-sided with no ability to recover as you never have to retreat your forces from enemy territory. You destroy all their starbases and win. Distances are too long, fleets take too long to rebuilt. Wars are unrecoverable.\n\n-Micromanagement is from the dark ages here. In Distant Worlds, you can automate everything or nothing. It is up to you, yet here in 2016, in Stellaris, I cannot assign production orders (edit: I want to stress how insane this oversight is: when you queue up two ships for instance, resources are deducted for both! Even though only one is being built. If you are attacked, you can simply cancel and receive all of your resources back even if the ship is 98% built WTF paradox! That's programming year one!) to stations or rally points! I have no control over my fleets in battle so I sit and watch as they spread damage over the entire enemy force instead of focus firing.\n\nWORST OF ALL: I cannot automate the GODDAM science and construction vessels. I have to shift click every single debris research in a sector of my god are you kidding me.\n\nOverall: The game is clearly unfinished. This is a bare shell, wich might hopefully be filled by future development, but do not buy it yet. Wait until it is patched severely and content is added. This is another in a long string of dissapointing 4X titles. You can do better Paradox.\n\nThis is a space 4X game and I have already beaten it on the hardest difficulty. That is saying something,\n\nEdit: The positives: I did have a very cool moment where my race became so populace that when I declared war on the once mighty bird people, I find that their leader is a member of my race, having presumably stabbed his way to leaderhood. I have to admit that that was a new one. Never saw that before in any 4X.","May 10","false","48.2"," 139 of 250 people (56%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","56","139","250","8","4"

As it stands the game isnt horrible, but there isnt enough variety for more then maybe one full playthrough. I am going to describe my full playthrough experience so a bit of spoiler warning here.\n\nThe early game is great. You survery around get your mini quests(situation log) and major quests which gives you a drive to finish and see what you get. You encounter probably 3-4 "neutral" aliens(prismatic, ameoba, void, mining, and the gas grazers) Learn more about them get trait specific options to resolve those quests. You research is quick lets you branch out and see what you focus on. Then you run into another Alien empire, which essentially walls you off from exploring or questing. This gives you three options go explore somewhere else, amass a fleet to eventually attack them to get them out of your way, or ally with them(which is basically the same as conquering them). You talk to the empire which is pointless unless you want to trade embassies and wait till you can form an alliance(which having one early makes it easier in the late game but ill get there).\n\nThe mid game is alright. At this point you have run into a few more alien factions, started colonizing other planets to expand your borders, and research is starting to slow down. They will start offering to trade star charts which ends up being a trap. While it is nice to be able to see more of the galactic map and resources they hold, it also removes the option to survey those worlds which means no anomolys(quests) Once you see more of the map you start to see that you are now boxed in by alien factions leaving you only two choices, ally with them or attack them. Since the diplomacy screen is basically "do you have an embassy?" most of the time you wont be able to invite them into an alliance, but usually that first alien you met will likely join up with you. So now you build your fleet that at max consists of 4 different ships: corvette, destroyer, cruiser, battleship based off of your shipyard level. ONLY 4 FOR EVERY RACE/FACTION. Granted you can "customize" each ship trying to make a more well rounded fleet with different weapon types, but you will fall into hitting the auto-best option because you cant counter the different types without knowing the types the enemy has. Anyways you built your fleet, then look at the diplomacy tab to see if the person you are about to attack has equal or less then fleet strength and you declare war. You set your war goals(anything other then vassalization just means your going to have to war with them again). Ally AI is set to put thier fleet ontop of your highest military power fleet. So now you send your death ball into their system you see thier fleet is numerically lower then the combined fleet of you and your ally and you clash. You get to sit and wait as the  ships just charge and swirl around each other until one fleet is dead. Your warscore goes up a bit for winning. You need at least 70% to win a war. Since you decimated thier fleet there wont be anymore fleet battles so now you have to build an army to take planets. Sit your fleet over a planet until the plantery defense number hits 0 and drops troops if you have a higher number you win and planet taken. Based off of how big the enemy empire is you will have to repeat this until you win the war. You WIN and now have a vassal!(which means you now have another ally to help you fight wars).\n\nThe late game and it is terrible. Research now takes decades even with all the research buffs you can muster. You have expanded  colonizing, frontier posting, or integrating your vassals(which takes exponetially longer based off thier size, one vassal took roughly 100 years). Entire map is seen you cant finish some of your quests(precurser alien quest), and some end game event happens. Mine was the prethorian scourge invaded the galaxy. At some point a quest to seize their queen appeared but it bugged out and i couldn't finish the quest. THe Prethorian scourge was systemactically infesting worlds and conquering empires. It was a cool event which spiced things up, until i realized that the ai factions didnt care about stopping it. It was just another day in the galaxy to them. So i was like fine I will handle it myself until i realize that the prethorian scourges planets cant be captured or destroyed. I had to systemactically go to every planet they had and leave a fleet in orbit bombing so they wouldnt produce anything anymore. With roughly half of my fleet capacity left to endlessly bomb unkillable ai i looked at the victory condition page. Only two options colony 40% or kill off everyone else which essentially boiled down to the same thing. Declare war on everybody who wasnt an ally or vassal. At this point is where the game reaches it most boring and it will happen for evey game you play(since there are no other victory conditions). Build battleships and train armies, declare war, demand vasslization kill enemy, invade planet, Systemaccally taking over the galaxy which may sound fun but it boils down to number battles. You spend more time building then fighting. Eventually you will win and it will be unsatisfying.\n\nTLDR Pros and Cons\nPros\n- Turnless civ game in space!\n- Very pretty\n- Anomolys(quests)\n- Cool research options(for the most part)\n- Early game\nCons\n- Diplomacy and everything about it\n- Influence(could have been an awesome diplomacy resource just ends up holding you back)\n- Mid and Late game end up a boring repetitive slog\n- DIFFERENCES IN RACES AND SHIPS, this kind of a big one. All races and ships are basically the same(aside from appearance) give me something that plays different .No purely robotic race, no zerg(plethorian scourge should have some sort of playable varient) One of the fallen empires has a ring world system I WANT IT why can i not have it?,\n\nFinal Verdict\nI can't recommend because after one playthrough you just wont want to play another because nothing really will change. I have tried ended up the same every game, especially the end game which is a snorefest. The game has a solid core to build upon and from what i hear these developers actually do stuff so i look forward to the future where this game is a must buy.\n\nRecommended changes.\n-More and varied research paths WITH FASTER SPEEDS or make a gameplay speed button measured in years because days doesnt cut it.\n-more and varied quest missions\n-more victory conditions\n-espionage and better diplomacy (USE INFLUENCE)\n-an even faster speed up option\n-more and varied base starting points(MAKE DIFFERENT EMPIRES PLAY DIFFERENTLY)\n-more and varied ships and weapons(wouldn't a militaristic have more then pacifists?!)\n-Do something with armies(who pays attention to moral?)","May 13","false","34.6"," 45 of 78 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","45","78","4","1"

It starts small and slow with excellent writing (exploration actually feels... exploratory), but then gradually turns into the static, politicing, and warmongering that you'd expect from a grand strategy game. I will admit the game as it currently stands feels like just the start of the journey. It is a well put together peice of software but it does lack some of the comlexity I've grown used to in other Paradox games. However, those games have also been DLC'd about 15 times a peice (additions of which I approve). Give the developers time to see how people play, hear what they want, and think about the game's direction and I'm positive the great base they've started with here will become just as magnificent as their other Grand Strategy Titles. Until then I'll just keep enjoying Stellaris in its excellent current form.","May 9","true","29.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomwarrior/recommended/281990/","doomwarrior","Doomwarrior","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomwarrior/","176 products in account","TLDR:\nWhat a gem in the making... lovely, enjoyable, stable even in Mp, still a bit rough around the edges but all in all, worth the money.\n\nHere a few more details from our 16ppl. Multiplayer Release Session:\n\nIt started out a bit rough, we couldnt get half the group in since we were using a password protected server. Once we removed the apparently buggy password, it worked like a charm for hours until very early in the morning when the hype train came to a slow stop when nearly everybody was falling asleep because we played the crap out of the game.\n\nAnd boy did everyone enjoy this. There was no dissappointment in our group. We started out as noobs and within just a few hours we sent fleets of 10k strength out to conquer, massive battles happened and empires got hammered. We even roleplayed our societies and alien nature to a degree. The Game invites you to do it, its just a lot of fun to do it.\n\nHere are some pros and cons:\nThe game starts out relatively slow. The first 1-2 hours are nice nonetheless cause of the exploration, the discoveries, the endless storylines and the research that enlightens you. But you dont really know what´s happening. There is no techtree you can look up to plan the best way to research and expand. You literally have to explore it. And it was pretty different for all of us. People in Teamspeak were constantly talking about stuff they researched which others never saw and didnt understand...cause it was fundamentally different from what they experienced....within the same game.\n\nThe Game was stable the entire time. We had a few crashes for a few guys, for whatever reason but the majority was able to play and the server never crashed. Hotjoining works like a charm, admin can allow new guys to hotjoin or kick them out. It does not disturb the gameflow. (unlike civ, where it stopped the game). It feels kind of well thought through and polished in that regard.\n\nGraphics are beautifull and bring the universe to life. Its the little things that make this game so nice. Supported with the storytelling its just so immersive. You feel like you are in a universe with a history. Stuff you find is thousands, sometimes millions of years old.\n\nThe Soundtrack is just freakin brilliant. People in our Server on Teamspeak were enjoying it a hell of a lot. It didnt disturb, it made you feel well and you were still able to play, talk, relax and enjoy the game. What else can you expect?\n\nHere are a few cons:\nSometimes, even though the UI is already well done, the game gets a bit tedious. For example your groundforces have to be managed manually one by one. You will need around 20-30 of them for an invasion. Now you go to a planet, recruit them and now each one of them can be equipped... enjoy the clickfest. Each one needs to be selected, outfitted again and again and again...and then you send them out, select their ships and move them to...whereever. Its tedious, crap and annoying and in dire need of an optimization in the UI.\n\nRevolts seem to be a bit out of balance. Imagine, your fleet just bombed the living hell out of a planet, you killed the defence, took it over, win the war...take the planet as your price and now what? People get unhappy, join a faction, declare war on you and spawn like a gazillion troops. Ofc, those are amazing, kick you in the face and throw you out. It took me 5 planets on full production of groundforces and several attemps to take 1 of 2 revolting planets back. I had to bring around 20-30 Groundtroops for a revolt... something you can take an entire empire with.\n\nOther than that, the game feels well balanced, nicely done and none of us really wanted to stop playing. But we were already falling  asleep so we HAD to stop.\n\nDamn you body, for being to weak to play and demanding sleep. Cant you see im hyped? ;-)\n\n11/10 would play an enslaving hivemind again that lives basically forever (in slavery) and is happy about it :D","May 9","true","240.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

You can create pretty much anything from a race of run-of-the-mill humans to space ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. From hippie-dippy xenophile democracies, to hive mind hegemonic empires that expunge all xenos in their path. Ships can be heavily customized and from the very start, you choose which type of FTL and weapons you start with among a few types. Upon the surface of planets and in orbit, you can spread your dominion and destroy or enslave all those in your wake. It is by all accounts a good all-around space 4x, there are however issues.\n\nPlanetary armies are nigh irrelevant, larger ships take forever to build, and wars are consequently won after one side has had most of their fleet destroyed. In most other Paradox 4x games, there's often the possibility to rise from the ashes and put up another round or more of force against your enemy once you've lost but not here. Exceptionally weak stations in orbit of a planet are the only source of ship construction and can easily all be destroyed before you get more than a destroyer or two out. Without the ability to build a navy from a planetary surface or use ground-to-orbit weaponry, victory is pretty much completely based on fleet strength.\n\nIn time I'm sure patches and expansions will smooth out combat issues but for now, its a good concept that pretty much makes anything but genocidal hegemonic empires simply incapable of maintaining a serious presence on the galactic stage.","May 21","true","114.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The general ratings you find on steam are typically trustworthy, unfortunately Stellaris does not follow suit. Before I go any further, may I say for the record, that I have shown ferverous support for Paradox. I have well over 1200 hours played on Ck2 and over 500 on EU4. Within 40 hours of playing Stellaris, I was dumbfounded by how unfinished of a product this truly is. The tiny intricate marvels the player experiences within the first half of the game become irrelevant by the time Big powers have become established. Races, Politics, decision making, even research, becomes almost arbitrary. The game boils down to how many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ships do you have in your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ death congolomerate and how many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ships do the other powers have in theirs. Paradox has never been known for detailed combat sequences, which I have always been okay with. Combat was never a major focus, for the majority of the titles they put out. Stellaris was not meant to be one of paradox's few excepetions. Unforatuntely the game becomes too restricted, in all facets of the word space, that the last half of the game ends up you declaring mind numbing wars for the however many hours it takes you to win.\nIn addition, There are tons of bugs. Just to name a few,\nMissing armies - If a war ends and you have armies stuck on a planet that you do not own, they end up "dissappearing". They will still show up on the side panel, and you will still have to pay upkeep for them, but you are unable to locate them and or disband them.\nNever Growing Pops-. There is a feature in the game in which you may allow your pops to freely migrate from planet to planet, not only within the confines of your empire, but other space empires if you so make an agreement with said parties. What ends up happening is, a pop of a particular race will move to your planet and then say "eh, this place ♥♥♥♥ing sucks" and leaves a solid 3 minutes later. once the pop gets there it starts to "Reproduce". a sillouhette will appear in a production slot of said species, but won't produce anything till it's fully grown. when the original pop migrates away. the shadow pop will stop growing because there are no more members of the same species on that planet. Instead of the shadow pop dissapearing it stays there stuck on 0.0 growth.\nGene mutation - ♥♥♥♥ed, ♥♥♥♥ed, ♥♥♥♥ed. ♥♥♥♥ed.\n\nThe interface, is also really ♥♥♥♥ing clunky. It's extremely unfriendly and I constantly find myself saying "why wouldn't they do this a different way" It seems as though it was an afterthought. Unfinished, much like the rest of the game.\n\nThat being said, there are some wonderful features. tons of intricacies that will literally help you forget all the other ♥♥♥♥ the game has been throwing in your face. The initial option of race/ empire creation is extremely detailed. It allows the player to really immerse him/herself into the game before it's even begun. It allows for a full range of motion in choosing a player's species' ideologies, short comings and strengths.\n\nEarly game alien interactions, research and discovery are also incredibly detailed and really help guide the game without it feeling too restricted.\n\nI just feel that, after spending 40 hours playing Stellaris and witnessing such an unfinished game, that I cant help but think that Paradox is taking full advantage of a loyal fanbase. This game was pegged as being one of the most colossal games they have ever released, and so far it seems as though they put such little time into it. I'm sure Paradox will fix it, but how many DLC's and expansions will I need to buy? How many mods will I need to download? I'm sorry, but for anyone who is thinking of buying this game, realize that despite paying 40 dollars for this game, you will not recieve a product worth the money in return.\n\n","May 19","false","45.3"," 80 of 145 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","80","145","2","3"

So if we could get a more conventional Tech Tree, or at least the choice to have a Tech Tree, that would be great.\n\nAll in all, the game is very good, with some more features it could be great, it just needs a bit more polish, some Trade (Outside of minerals for energy, or info etc.,) such as Trade Lanes that provide a net boost to Credits, more in-depth Diplomacy, a bit more control over the sectors (I have a few hundred energy and they often have thousands), and a bit more balance over the Military, and it should be great.\n\nStill worth a buy right now, it is very enjoyable, it just has potential to be even greater.","May 13","true","73.4"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","0"

It's a Paradox game, you can be assured of that. And you know what, I'm going to reccommend this game because there's sadly not a whole lot of polished space strategy games out there, and this one is certainly worth taking a peek at.\n\nHOWEVER, and I suggest you read this... (EDIT: Added a list of things below if you're into reading ;)\n\nThe game would have you believe this is a very indepth space strategy game about cultivating an alien civilization. And... sure, it is. But it feels less like a grand strategy and more like a somewhat shallow 4X game.\n\nThe biggest issue at this point is simply that the only way to 'play' or 'win' the game right now is the expand and or conquer. Literally- those are the only winning conditions.\n\nWhich wouldn't be an issue, but military conquest and alliance making is literally the entire mid to end game. The game is surprisingly shallow once you hit that stage, and don't expect to build a race focused on amassing wealth via complex trade like the Ferengi, or silently striking with espionage like the Romulans... there just aren't any mechanics for it. You're either making a race that likes to build alliances, or a race that likes to conquer people.\n\nBut I'm still reccomending the game, because it's still a solid game. And it's a great CORE game, and I can guarantee you Paradox will flood you with DLCs adding new mechanics into the game to really bring it to life, and allow you to play it as you want.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nWHAT NEEDS FIXING (will update):\n\n- Improved AI, so it can better control its fleets especially during war-time.\n- Improved ally AI, as right now allies do not think independently and instead simply follow your largest fleet about. AI also needs to consider other members of the alliance when suggesting a war, which currently it doesn't.\n- Various bugs need a fix'n.\n\nWHAT THE GAME NEEDS:\n\n- Trade system. Setting up physical trade routes, consdering various goods made by your own empire and xeno cultures, PIRACY and space pirates, that sort of stuff. Indepth economy.\n- Improved diplomacy options, especially in conversing and suggesting things to allies. Things like "attack X planet" or "follow X fleet".\n- World generation options. Need more galaxy shapes, an advanced start option, and reaaally need to be able to turn off biased world generation (if you're playing an ocean planet specieis, a good three to four systems around you will always be full of ocean planets).\n- More victory conditions relating to something other than conquering or intergrating other races.\n\nWHAT THE GAME COULD DO WITH (maybe DLC?):\n\n- Espionage! Cloaking technology! Romulans, baby!\n- Hell, even religion would have a place due to the fanatical space races in the game.\n- Scouting ships, physical envoys, more ship roles.\n- Possibilities are endless.","May 11","true","82.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

I know I restarted 3 times and 1 of those was WAY better than the other two.\n\nSo this is what I really liked about the game so far:\n\n- I LOVE the initial exploration phase. Sending multiple science and war ships to unlock systems and thoroughly scan them for habitable planets and resources is extremely fun and totally scratches my itch for discovery and going where no man has gone before.\n- I LOVE how easy it is to get into the game. Granted, I might have had help by watching the youtubers, but I could totally get into the gameplay without any hiccups, unlike Paradox's other Grand Strategies EU4 or CK2, where I was totally overwhelmed, even to the point of leaving them back for a long time.\n- I LOVE the freedom the game gives you. You can play with a pre-made civilizazion, or make your own the way you feel like, which is what I did. I totally recommend people do that - it is so much fun mixing and matching stuff and testing them out. You can be a warmonger, pacifist, mercantilist, mogul, expansionist, whatnot!\n- I LOVE how the playthroughs can differ from one another. In my 3 starts, I had 3 totally different experiences, based on resources, events, encounters, galaxy composition, star composition, etc. JUST AWESOME!\n- I LOVE how everything you do feels IMPORTANT and not even remotely boring.\n- I LOVE how choices have meaningful continuations - not like Civilization Beyond Earth for example, where everything resulted in similar outcome. Here you can either continue a quest line, stop a quest line, drive it to a conclusion that gives you various rewards, and so on.\n- I like how you get to customize everything after you start. You can let the game guide your hand or go completely wild with your own ship designs, options, and whatnot.\n- I like the new research system. Stellaris breaks the mold by allowing you multiple research topics at once, which amounts to crazy amounts of research options, based on anything you find through events, dead alien bodies, destryoned alien ships, and so on.\n- I like how everything in your empire can level up and improve - your admirals, planetary governors, scientists, everything but the little settlers levels up and gets more and more useful as the game goes on.\n- I like how you are NOT put into a level playing field. Every race has it forte's, and some have been in space way longer than you, which makes them way too overpowered. Like Q in Star Trek.\n- I like how you can just play the game and have fun.\n- I like how you can easily make friends and enemies.\n- I like how the game both holds your hand through quests and missions, but at the same time, does not impose itself on you and lets you do it your way.\n- I like how the tutorial helps you as you go, not with simple tips, pre-made missions, or pre-made scenarios that have nothing to do with a real game.\n\nConclusion: Paradox did it again - they proved themselves as a developer that carefully chooses its games and drives them to perfection. This games does it all for me - it scratches every itch I may have: exploration, development, diversity, diplomacy, variety, engaging play, everything. I expect dumping hundreds of hours into this game, and pray I have the time for that...","May 9","true","51.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

I purged many of the peasant alien races one by one, and anyone else who dared to speak against me, even my fleet admirals and scientists (ok they don't actually do that ingame but I take my roleplaying srsly gais). The majority of the galaxy was mine, only two factions left.\n\nThere was the empire west of the galactic center, they lost many colonies, but they hadn't lost their will to resist. There was also another empire to the east of the galactic center, secluded by a Nebula. Because I am pretty much a God, I attack both at the same time. The battle against the western empire resulted in a loss, their coordinated point defence systems had my missles on lockdown, something which I did not anticipate. My laser equipped ships did enough damage to halt any sort of immediate follow up strike, but the remainder of my fleet required extensive repairs after initiating an emergency tacticool runawaywarp. The war in the east was even worse. The Nebula cloud slowed down my FTL warp travel, and because I decided to split the fleet into many fleetlings and attack from all sides, the jumps were very poorly coordinated. One fleetling jumped in after another had been completely obliterated by their defence platforms and ships. It was painful to watch, but then it hit me. Watching my severly underpowered 2K fleetings get their FTL drives stuck up their crewmen excrement ejector by 15K+ fleets reminded me of my galactic genocidal conquest.\n\nI bought this game to play, but I ended up feeling instead when I realised that I had pretty much been roleplaying Stalin's third reich of the rising sun. Tears streaked down my eyes as I watched my empire slowly break apart. This is what it felt like to have things taken away from you, to have your people enslaved by other people. One by one colonies fell, people rebelled and my leaders at the ripe young age of 200 years old began dying. I just sat there, staring at my home planet. Earth was beautiful, her deep blue oceans and earthy earth was the envy of the galaxy. My will to fight had been reignited.\n\nI rapidly built many defence platforms around the Sol system, made new battleships specifically designed to defend the OG waifu, Earth, and hired new fleet admirals. Then... I waited. (This is the part where they stopped trying to kill me out of empathy but I made them want to kill me again because it would be a cooler story). Sure enough, they came. Missles flew, cannons spewed, lasers pierced the darkness, and joint fighters filled the spaces inbetween as the defence of Sol became a reality. Wave after wave of ships forced me into learning how to micro-manage seperate ships to coordinate repairs, upgrades and tacticool decisions in order to fight at full efficiency. The waves would not stop, the fighting continued for several years, until finally they destroyed one of the defence platforms and punctured a hole in my inpenetrable wall. It set off a chain reaction, my wall began to crumble, until there was only the Earth ground defence army left. Huge fleets moved in and bombarded Earth with no remorse. Invasion fleets creeped in after the big bois and landed on her soil. With our fortifications destroyed and moral at an all time low, she fell in a matter of weeks.\n\nI had lost not only the game, but my heart as well. At that point I decided to go to bed. It was 5AM, and I cried myself to sleep, not because I had an important ethics test which I didn't study for the next day, but because of this game. :'(/10, never roleplaying again.","May 19","true","25.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","0"

It does this by combining the real-time (though pausable) orders system with a massively in-depth command and control element, not to mention the massive technology research trees that go from usuing simple thrusters on your ships to navigate your system to FTL-drives for inter-galaxy travel.\n\nThis game takes a while to get into, but it does have an optional tutorial system built in that will explain what each screen does, and introduce you to many of the deeply-involving facets of the game. Its by no means an EASY game to get into - you aren't going to be taking over the galaxy within the first 10 minutes, but if you can afford to put time into a game such as this, I feel you'll find it deeply rewarding. I've only spent ~5hrs with it so far, and I certainly enjoy it.\n\nPros:Widely customisable : You can not only crate your own faction and name it what you like, but you can also set traits that will affect how other space-faring civilisations view you - whether it be as a xenophobic human military-dictatorship (my current build) or as a plant-based pacifist race. You are also able to customise and design your own ships using technology you research to outfit them with the fastest engines and most-powerful weaponry.\nHuge scope: Starting a new game allows you to determine the size of the galaxy (as well as many other options). The galaxy my current game has currentlyt holds ~1000 star systems, with each system holding on average 5 or 6 planetary bodies (some habitiable, some only useful for their resources).\nCons:Only worth getting if you can afford to sink a lot of time into. I'm 5 hours in and am barely scratching the surface. As I said above its a slow game to get into, but I feel it is becoming a rather rewarding experience.\n10/10 - Not a game for everyone, as many prefer the faster-pace offered by other genres, but if you're a strategy fan then words cannot convey how much I recommend this game.","May 23","true","35.7"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","0"

You will be presented a choice in all categories [number of options varies]. When you've completed a research the choices in that category get randomized, meaning you get to pick only between a few of the available research topics. It works well, for making new games different. However there is a problem:\n\nCombat currently consists of your fleets getting "locked" in combat, and you are no longer able to control the ships. So for my second game, when I had focused on long range, large, fast moving ships [no armor and/or shield]. I got completely destroyed, even though I had 185% the range and 130% engine speed.\n\nSo if you don't mind that there is a [definitive] right way to play this game, and that you might get the wrong research options repeatedly: you'll have a great time.\n\nI think that for the first time they really messed up, I mean EU4 wasn't great on release, but it wasn't this much of a mess.","May 13","false","38.0"," 29 of 50 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","29","50","3","0"

To be honest I have\nso much apprehension to this genre it has always kept me away. I used to\nwatch my friends sink hundreds of hours in Crusader Kings, and Europa\nUniversalis 4 and they seemed to love it. I was always sitting in the back\nthinking, “I don’t want to have to go back to school practically to learn a\nvideo games mechanics and the finer points of the game before I can give\nit a try.\n\nSo I picked up Stellaris the newest title by Paradox and as someone\nwho is new and was previously intimidated by 4x, I can say with confidence\nthe game is quite excellent and above all accessible! The game features\na great level of customization from everything about planet management\n(buildings, policies, upgrades) to individual ship designs (weapons, power,\nshielding) as well as empire customization (leader traits, government style,\nmilitary tech start, etc) The game allows for you to custom tailor your star\nfairing race to a fine point. As well as the finer details of micromanagement\nand creating sectors to manage planets under one “system/sector” so\nthat takes a bit of the stress off the individual micro of planets.\n\nThe game features a beautiful aesthetic barring performance issues at\nthis moment of writing it. Giant space battles and honestly when Civs start\ngrowing and filling the map you are going to see a frame hit. I am running\na 980ti… so there are things left to be desired in terms of game performance\nbut I have heard they are hard at work fixing these optimization problems.\nso I do have faith Paradox will work hard on fixing the issues that are affecting\nthe game currently. They also have given full mod support to the community\nso expect some amazing mods and total conversions (BSG,MassEffect,Star\nWars,Star Trek, etc). Stellaris has a lot it got right and it made it fun for me\nto learn and to challenge myself to manage my empire better.\n\nThe game features fun random events that can be great for your empire\nor not so great. It also features a random tech tree so you really won't have\nthe same options a second time in the order you get them in say your first\ngame. Which I personally enjoy, take Civ5 for example with an incredibly\nlinear tech tree, having a random tech tree with “rare” tech etc spices things\nup and encourages you to play differently and focus on what you need or\nare going for rather than following the same path over and over again. It\nadds variety and fun challenges to your empires rise and potential fall.\n\nI could talk about the game all day to be honest but I think I will try to\nkeep this someone concise. Stellaris may be Paradox’s best 4x game yet.\nI have a new genre to enjoy and sink massive hours into. This is an easy\nrecommend to veterans of 4x/Paradox games, and even a recommend\nfor those trying to get into this genre. It’s fun, accessible, and addictive!\n\n","May 22","true","26.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

All those funny stories you see on many positive reviews, yes those are pretty much accurate. And being a game from Paradox, it has a lot of influences from their Grand Strategy, although my minor nitpick is that they dumbed it down to appeal to 4X players, but that's just me.\n\nThe main reason I gave this a thumbs down is that although this game is extremely polished, this game is incomplete (you can read other negative reviews to see what they are). They should have had 2 more months of development - but the good thing is that it will definitely get 2 more months of development. Paradox never stops working on their games (however, they also don't know when to stop, or just don't want to stop, after what we've seen from the unnecessary, ahistorical, and almost game-breaking updates they've added to CK2 and EU4, but this is beside the point).\n\nIf you're a hardcore Paradox fan that's been following this game for months, buying it full price now isn't all that bad. But to the players new to Paradox games, hardcore 4X players, and casuals, this game is not at its full potential yet. Wait for a sale or until they've added bug fixes (whichever comes first), or maybe even until the first DLC comes out, because as of now people who've played this game religiously since the minute it came out have already seen everything this game has to offer, and even for me after 10 hours it's becoming stale.\n\nI will eventually change this into a thumbs up after the game has gone through the necessary changes.\n\nI see a bunch of elitists who keep ranting about how Distant Worlds is better, and I won't argue that it isn't, but don't underestimate Paradox's ability to literally triple a game's content/complexity, revamp the UI, and fix thousands of bugs through DLCs. And don't say "DLC is content that should have been in the base game in the first place" because this isn't a full price game, $40. The difference between Paradox games and every other strategy game is that Paradox will continuously add new content and quality-of-life updates to their games for at least the next 4 years. Not many strategy games do that, sometimes they just release a sequel. But Stellaris won't need a sequel for a long time. Eventually maybe after 3 or 4 DLCs Stellaris could be a competent competitor to Distant Worlds. Don't quote me on that.\n\nYes, everyone knows Paradox is ruthless when it comes to DLCs. But as long as the DLC isn't game breaking like Conclave or overpriced like The Cossacks, then it's worth the money (but still, I'd recommend waiting for sales).\n\n\nTLDR in italic text","May 12","false","37.8"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","0"

Mid and late game  it may take you 5-10 hours to get through that same 10 years....or longer. It's pretty severe. To add insult to injury, this game does not have multi core support.

In the end it will pretty much always be you, by yourself, against large federations.\n\nCombat system.\nMANY, many issues. Just one example....you can have a combat score at 100% and the game will not give you the win due to some other empire taking a planet during your conflict. This is just one example of MANY.\n\nSector system.\nYeah don't get me started here. I understand what they were going for here, and it failed. At least in the sector AI.

I just lacks flavor and most playthroughs feel the same. Midgame is pretty empty and galaxy conquest becomes annoying once you built up some aggression with your enemies who'll all join the same alliance so taking a planet is going to net you relatively few war score and it's going to take forever to win the wars which oftentimes lack major engagements, because the AI is literally programmed to run from you unless they outnumber you 1.5:1 which is rarely the case. This all ties in with the lack of meaningful late game diplomacy.\n\nAll in all you'll probably enjoy a single blob playthough and then start with a couple of different empires to realize it will all mostly play out the same anyways and the fact that the government and ethics are kinda imbalanced like playing xenophics is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when collectivists get the straight up better bonuses, techs and buildings. They've already mentioned it in the patchnotes, but to repeat it: Ethic convergence is annoying as ♥♥♥♥ and can barely be countered besides choosing conformist at the start of the game with a fat 20% bonus. ♥♥♥♥ like this cripples playstyles due to min/max concerns on my part.

Combat:  This is just a "bigger number wins" with very little player input.\n2. Diplomacy is basically non-existent. As AI is notoriously difficult to programme well in a fluid negotiating system Paradox have gone for the easier route of "The only deal the AI is going to agree to is massively one-sided in their favour". Irrespective of supposed species/cultural preferences. This means they can avoid the AI making stupid deals by forcing the payer to make them instead.\n3. Planet development/ Empire Development: Build stuff, research new stuff, build that. Very little so far to make each planet feel unique after the intial clearance/settlement. Some minor balancing of resource generation.....\n4. War/Conquest: There seem to be a lot of artificial barriers to carrying out a war of conquest. You can only capture X number of planets before the war finishes, no war after that for Z years with same faction, integration very slow etc etc. Some of these may be realistic but I have the terrible suspicion that they were put there to prevent a good player (not me) from steamrolling and winning too quickly.\n\nAll in all I found myself too often playing on "Fast" or "Fastest" waiting for the next bit of research, planet development.\n\nConclusion: Shallow 4x light that is disappointing given its creators. However your enjoyment may differ and hopefully patches will add some depth!\n\n\n\n","May 12","false","46.6"," 67 of 123 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","67","123","4","0"

Well we spent another good 10-30 minutes in the first second being paused, as we tried to decipher the things before us. It was a great help, that the full tutorial AI explained everything we clicked on in detail. After mostly figuring out what is what, we started time, and begun to survey the galaxy. Everything started out a bit slow and shaky, but when we got used to the controls it all started to fit in place. After a few hours of gaming you could clearly see the difference me and my friend represent. He with the humans, focusing on expansion and advanced ships, while myself focusing on high level resource management, and fast but precise exploration. To end this wall of text, I think the game is very well able to fit your requirements of an empire you established.\nThis is only my first expression, I'll make sure to put more hours in the game and provide a more deep, fact based analyis.\n\nSetis logging off.","May 10","true","42.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Once you have a huge empires with 5 sectors and 100 planets, you find yourself performing repetitive clicking to perform one single thing. I thought the point of having sectors is so that micromanagement are no longer needed whislt you focus on building your fleet.\n\nOnline experience\n- in battle, its pretty hard to coordinate with your team - steam chat is a must, the built in chat system sucks so bad\n- notification and awareness - i dont know if my ally is getting attacked, i dont know where theyre getting attack. if only there was a Ping command (like RA2/LoL)\n\nAI is very very dumb and you can exploit that to your advantage.\n\nBut I still recommend the game. Replayability is a pro. Wait for more DLC and community mods to make this game more interstellar.\n\nGaming Experience\n=====================\n\nBought the game last night. Played tutorial for 2 hours. Went to bed.\nCame home after work and had a quick nap. Restart a new game. Clocked 7 hours.\n\nI spent the first 6 hours expanding, researching  and met 2 alien life forms. One was nice, and the other one was a ♥♥♥♥. I tried to be nice, but the ♥♥♥♥ alien insulted me. Expanded into one of his nearby territory and he declared war on me. The 7th hour, I spent my time building an army, Destroyers and Attack ships.\n\nThen I realized its 2am and Ive got work tomorrow.\n\n=====================\nGame Review\n============================\n\nIm not a fan of 4X.  Mainly due to it's steep learning curve and annoying UI. I played HomeWorld, but didnt like it that much. However,  I do love is Resource Management and Base Building games. I came from Cities XL, Sim City, Command and Conquer series, so I was suprised to how easy it was to get into Stellaris.\n\nI love the simplicity of tech research, attacking without micromanagement, simple UI.\n\nItsworth it. Ive gifted a copy to my buddy so that we can play together.

There is no real tactical depth into it.\n\nAlso AI allies/vassals tend to follow your main fleet everywhere. AI is not really fleshed out and it was the easiest/cheapest way to make them usefull in the war.\n\nInstead of taking a time and planning your tactics with various generals from alliances on the galaxy-map,setting up objectives and everyone would know what to do, you have this. Think how fantastic it would be. But nah not even Military Junta government have anything similar to this, yeah goverments are just bunch of raw stat boosts and AI behaviour alterations.\n\nAll alien races feel way too *humanoid* to mee, this game could use more varied gameplay styles like devouring worlds instead of colonizing planets. Also where are robot races? Cyborg races? Its all the same gameplay, only some AIs will colonize more , some less planets.\n\nI won't mention how the game punishes you for having a big population and influence really limits your gameplay. Or several annoyanced like sectors or not-so-good AI. This game also runs on 1 cpu , come one its 2016, you can dream about generating 10k galaxies with 500 AIs in the future with mods.\n\nGame also has some solid problem in the late game with the performance. And how warscore is not so good idea, what if I just want to glass every planet? What If i don't really care about warscores and I want to quickly conquer their empire? I don't really think every race would behave the same, always respecting *some-kind-of-universal-galaxy-law-about-the-warscore*. Klingonds didn't, they fought for the sake of combat and honours and some should fight for the same of domination, afraidness, using the weak-sides.\n\nRight now it looks like this, you conquer 3 planets, 10year peace-period and repeat. Its called a artifical time extender, same goes for surveying systems with your science ship and clicking on every debris manually by shift-click. I can understand in the early-mid but in the late there could be some kind of automatization, there are bigger concerns than clicking on small X all around the galaxy. Less micromanaging in late-game please.\n\nno trade routes ( it would be nice to see small cargo-ships travelling between your systems, it would add a lot the the gameplay mechanics like "cut the supply lines" )\n^ also no pirates? really? they only happen in 1 event and disappear forever\nno espionage\nno sabotages\nno family tree? really?\nno marriages\nno sabotages\nGood game , had fun but it just feels unfinished. I really dig the random-event and reading lore but there needs to be more of it, especially in the mid/late game.  Its just average game at this moment.  Kinda gets boring after a while.\n\nMaybe after year or two with some decent dlc/updates, this game will get better, well for sure it will get.","May 28","true","62.3"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Impsmash/recommended/281990/","Impsmash","Impsmash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Impsmash/","329 products in account","Salutations fellow gamers!\n\nI just wanted to write a quick first impressions review of Stellaris so far. I am only 3 hours into it so far but so far its been great! I have a good number of RTS and 4x strategy games. Only a few of them are Paradox Interactive games such as Mount and Blade, War of the Roses, Magicka, King Arthur Strategy Game, and of course now is Stellaris. My class mates have been talking it up for the past few weeks and enticed me to finally get it on release day and I am very pleased with it.\n\nFor a strategy game it is very fluid yet methodical. When I say this I am thinking in my mind that this is a slight hybrid of Endless Space and Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion (both of which are great). Yet, this game is fluid without turns and you can even adjust the time to even pausing the game. This also is in effect in multiplayer but more on that later.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\nCost: It varies on what edition you get of the game, I personally got the Nova edition because it comes with a portrait species (literally only cosmetic, no effects on gameplay apart from just an alien spider like Arthropod archetype species) as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack is definitely worth the extra cost for its great quality and good atmosphere. Though for those who are into the game alone then just get the base game, the upper tiers of editions are really only cosmetic and support of the developers (along with social goodies such as forum badges, though that may I have changed by now). I would say for the quality of game it is in right now, it is worth the $50 I spent for the Nova edition.\n\nGameplay is rather unique and I do not think I gave it justice by implying it was a hybrid of Endless Space and Sins of a Solar Empire because it is a really interesting and great style of play. Generally speaking it is just like any other RTS where you develop your empire and encounter other species with differing responses. The empire creator by the way is wonderful and very finite, with editing the style of government and its ethics (all very compliced and not going into it with this first impressions, essentially just traits of your empire but could have different styles based on choices. There are a specific trait system that balances out with negatives and positives, much like Zomboid character traits, etc.) All in all the gameplay is typical for anyone who has played an RTS/4x game and I had no problem picking up the mechanics within the first 10-20 minutes.\n\nMultiplayer is very interesting because supposedly it can go beyond 32 players (not recommended for ease of play). It is very simple to play with friends and even random people, though I would sit down prior and create your own empire if you so choose to rather than making everyone wait. The only gripe I have with multiplayer is that the thing I mentioned about controlling time is available to everyone (no clue if there is a host option to limit power or not). So at first people were pausing and slowing/speeding time up for EVERYONE so we had to set up some ground rules. All in all very fluid, my friends experienced minor lag problems but nothing hindering playability (could've been my friend's crappy internet hosting).\n\nFor a game that I never heard about until the last few weeks, it is a suprisingly great game that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good RTS/4x game much like Endless space/etc. If you have friends than more the merrier because I've been enjoying playing with them quite a bit. This has been my first impressions and I give it a good thumbs up! :)\n\n- :sphere:","May 9","true","34.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Serbpreme/recommended/281990/","Serbpreme","Turkslayer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Serbpreme/","232 products in account","Allow me to preface this review by stating that Stellaris is an unfinished product. No matter how I or anyone else may feel about this game, be it positive or negative, this game was blatantly left unfinished by the developers at release. If you purchase this game, expect a host of features to be left in a foundational state that will necessitate the purchasing DLC for a "full experience."\n\nAbstractStellaris is a procedurally generated science fiction strategy game, melding traits from both 4X and grand strategy. An empire/race builder launches the campaign, allowing you to design your primary species: appearance, physiological traits, ethics (which determine your empire's socio-political alignment), favored weapon type, ship/planet cosmetics, etc. Upon completing your empire, a galaxy is generated for you by means of several options (galaxy type, size, number of AI, etc.) and you begin your journey from the day your civilization develops faster-than-light spacefaring capability.\n\nGraphicsThe Stellaris universe is simple but gorgeous. The galaxy is populated with a host of stars, beautifully detailed planets, craggy asteroid belts, vivid nebulae, and abyssal black holes. Dozens of fascinating and creative alien portraits populate the game's biosphere. The UI and other interface elements do need work, however. The empire building screen at game start suffers from an unnecessary amount of negative space. When in the campaign itself, several interfaces (such as the ship designer UI or the planet building screens) tend to either block the gameplay screen or suffer from "too many buttons to click" syndrome, requiring a large amount of slowed or paused gametime whilst you micromanage.\n\nStoryThe storytelling capability in Stellaris is immense. In just under forty hours of gameplay, I've racked up a host of adventures in intergalactic politics, wars and general mechanical quirks. A key factor is the empire building capability - I love creating my own empires specifically designed for the AI and enabling them to appear in my campaigns. There's nearly unlimited of roleplaying potential here. The primary vehicle that drives the story are the event chains - overarching narratives that really drive your expansion and exploratory impetus throughout the early game, but unfortunately tend to drop off until the late game. Randomly generated late-game crises such as synth rebellion, extradimensional invaders and more can shake things up substantially in the late years of your campaigns.\n\nGameplayAs stated, the early game of Stellaris is fantastic. Throughout multiple playthroughs, the sense of exploration and mystique never seems to go away as you set out into your galaxy for the first time. As you start to colonize more and more planets, delegate sectors and begin engaging in galactic-state politics, however, the game slows down and becomes even somewhat of a slog.\n\nConclusionAs it stands, Stellaris is an unfinished game with very promising potential, capability and strong mechanics for a foundation. Though undoubtedly it's my current favorite title because I can look past these flaws and see that it'll be built upon and made into a truly fantastic sci-fi experience, I can't quite recommend it to a casual or entry-level grand strategy gamer right yet. I recommend it wholly to Paradox veterans and people willing to look past the DLC model.\nAs a friend put it, Stellaris needs its "Art of War" (one of the key expansions for Europa Universalis IV which truly "completed" the game.) This pricing model of releasing a barebones product and reinforcing it with well over $150 in DLC is getting old and needs to be called out.\n\nGraphics - 8/10\nStory - 8/10\nGameplay - 6/10\nReplayability - 7/10\nJust What is Stellaris Missing, Exactly? -- A Full List of Concepts to be Added and Quality of Life Fixes to be Made","May 13","true","138.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","2"

So many, many, game-breaking, fun-destroying bugs but at least with a promise for fixes. See below.\n- Lack of content. We know Paradox sells games with a lower entry price and lots and lots of DLC expansions. That’s the way they roll, and mostly, it works. At least, it works for their own niche of grand strategy. For a game that supposedly crosses over into 4X territory, people have come to expect certain things, like a proper diplomacy system, or some kind of espionage. Current midgame is incredibly dull.\n- Clamping brakes on the player. Let me explain. The sector system is, according to the devs, a brilliant way to reduce all the tedious micromanagement. Only that for those people who like micromanagement, the sectors are just as mandatory as for anybody else. Which means that you can keep 5 (10 if you play specifically for core planets) planets under your control. You are then forced to hand the rest over to a broken, dumb-as-bricks AI, which not only makes your empire weaker, it also leads to said empty midgame, because all the nice colony management and tweaking you could spend your time with is stripped away from you. Personally, I don’t buy the micromanagement explanation, I think it’s to slow down human players in comparison to the AI empires, which use the same, broken, dumb-as-bricks sector AI and are generally not the sharpest knives in the drawer.\n- Horrible UI. This is perhaps the worst of all, because all others are fixable, and are supposed to be fixed in time, with 2 big patches announced for May and June. But the UI is all form and no function. Pause settings? Nope. Message filter? Nope. Ledger? Useful diplo interface? Nope and nope. Proper event log? What do you think you are playing, a grand strategy game by Paradox? … Oh. Right.\n\nAbout the bugs:\nWant some examples? Sure:\n- the ethics systems, central to the game, with factions and what-have-you tied into it, is randomly broken. Divergence is all over the place, sometime your whole population looses an ethic tenet completely before you have even finished surveying your home system (read: in 15 minutes of playtime tops)\n- quest chains that might give you something to do in the otherwise dull midgame break at random, because you got survey data or star charts about a system you were supposed to look at, or just because… well, because.\n- the battle system is broken. Period. The smallest ships rule supreme, because nothing else hits them.\n- did I mention the sector AI being broken? Not only stupid, but simply broken, ignoring the few settings you can give it?\n\nNow, the bugs are supposed to be fixed by the end of June, when the second big patch hits.\nThe first is currently in beta, but I have not included it in this review because it is currently a mess of back and forth hotfixing (seriously, hotfix deployment on a Friday? That is asking for trouble).\n\nStellaris is not bad. But it is nowhere as good as it could be.\nIf you think about buying, wait until the end of June for patch Asimov (1.2) to land, and do more research then. Buying now will only make you mad if your standards are anywhere near mine.\n","May 28","false","36.3"," 57 of 105 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","57","105","0","1"

It holds up well as a representative of that genre in terms graphics and interface, but I'm guessing you're more interested in what sets it apart from the rest of the pack--for better or worse.\n\nFor Better:\n\n1. The randomized tech tree system is an interesting twist on the usual tech tree. You don't know when you'll see a particular option again, so you really have to weigh each decision. There are occasional "rare" cards that show up, too, which are often related to anomolies you've discovered and researched with your science ships. I think all of this is well done.\n\n2. You can assign leaders to command fleets, govern planets or sectors, man science ships or research teams, and lead armies. All of these leaders have their own traits and level up with experience. It literally puts a face on aspects that other games leave rather abstract or generic.\n\n3. The ship designer lets you customize your ships if you feel like it. It's not as flexible as the designers in similar games, but it's better than nothing. However, I found it more convenient to just let the AI automatically upgrade my ships as new techs became available. In other words, it turned out not to be very useful (to me), but I still appreciate having the option.\n\n4. The music is particularly good. Even after 60 hours of play, I never felt the desire to turn it off or listen to something else instead. Remarkable, really.\n\nFor Worse:\n\n1. The developer obviously isn't a fan of micromanaging. Fine, but instead of allowing you to assign sectors or planets to AI, you're forced to. It's my game; I should be allowed to play it how I want, not how a designer thinks I should.\n\n2. Upgrading your fleets take so long that you're better off just destroying or disbanding them and making new ones instead. This isn't realistic and feels wrong.\n\n3. It's irritating during an intense battle to have to keep pausing the game to give new orders to a science vessel, construction ship, research team, or hire a new leader after one passes away. It'd be nice if you could somehow supress time so that you could focus on a battle rather than be constantly distracted with this stuff. It'd be nice if you could set your science and construction ships to automatically survey and build stations, respectively. While the system will let you queue up actions, this doesn't work if you don't currently have the resource (minerals, mostly) available. I'd rather it let me queue up anyway, and just perform the action if and when the resource becomes available.\n\n\nIn balance, though, I think the pros outweigh the cons, particularly if you're burned out on the classics of this genre. Half the fun (to me, at least) of these games is learning the ropes, and this one is sufficiently different to stay engaging for quite awhile.\n\nFollowing is my Matt Chat review of it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1gJ1zribo","May 23","true","61.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Stellaris is most readily compared to Master of Orion 2, Endless Space, and vanilla Civilization 5, so that's what I'll be using as a benchmark here.\n\nMy main complaint is that this game seems very unfinished. It plays like a beta. There are only hotkeys for about half of the stuff you want to do, the UI is confusing, arcane and the general empire management isn't really that fun.\n\nSo let's say you have a gigantic empire of 40-100 planets. If you're good at macroing, well, screw you, since there's a mechanic that punishes you for it. You're not allowed to control more than 5 planets at a time(heavy penalties if you try), and you have to put them into inefficient, AI-controlled "sectors" past then, where they can be automatically governed. But the sectors seem to not only make poor decisions, they produce less resources than just owning the cities themselves. It's not very clearly outlined exactly how this works since there isn't an ingame 'civilopedia' or similar, but my biggest complaint is that they don't produce armies or ships during wartime. You have to manually go through your AI-controlled cities, each and every one, and produce ships for your war effort.\n\nThus, my next point; the hotkeys are garbage. There isn't a hotkey to scroll through your controlled planets (that I know of,) there isn't a hotkey to mass-produce corvettes or battleships from their starports (that I know of.) Shamefully, there are some hotkeys, such as changing between the planetary and galaxy view, but the developers seem to have been extremely short-sighted with what does and doesn't have a hotkey.\n\nThis game is played in real-time, so hotkeys should be numerous and useful. But the game isn't truly real-time, because most of your empire management happens while paused. It feels like a Total War game, where all the macromanagement happens turn-based, and all the combat happens in real-time. There's honestly no reason for there to BE a real-timer on the overworld, and this brings up the settings menu. It is completely barren. There's no settings to turn off random events, or turn off negative ones, or turn them down. There's no setting to change the game between real-time and turn-based. There's no setting to speed up the incredibly slow development in the early game (in civ 5, you can start in the classical or medieval or information eras.) Ingame, there's hardly anything to speed up the incredibly slow development of research. You can build a science facility, giving one research per turn in each of the research paths. But researches start to cost 15,000+ research to complete, and no matter the size of your empire, that will still take 40-80 months ingame time. Unheard of in the 4x strategy genre, there is ABSOLUTELY NO research acceleration. No libraries, no research labs, no gas giants you can colonize to generate huge amounts of research/production/whatever.\n\nIt plays like a skeleton for future expansions, but I am not optimistic for those expansions. The game, as I find it, is a straight downgrade from Master of Orion 2.","May 18","false","13.8"," 47 of 86 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","47","86","0","0"

(The review will be updated in a years time after the 1st dlc arrives) After playing for a little over a hundred hours I think I've seen enough to give a fair opinion. The game is a bare bones 4x(if you can even call it that).\n\n+A variety of special events and lore activities like the ones in CK2 and EU4\n+Looks beautiful especially the space battles best looking paradox game to date!\n+Nothing more satisfying than looking at that cool ARC emitter you spent years researching blasting the face off of that that enemy battle ship at long range.\n\nAnd that there is pretty much where the praises end:\n\n-Diplomacy is so lacking it's pathetic and there's only 2 war options liberate and cede planet.\n-AI is bad all around especially when it comes to sectors.\n-Sectors are just a black hole where you dump planets and forget about them. They have NO events to speak of.\n-Needs more events! You'll see some events more than a dozen times throughout a single game.\n-Lot's of broken events (Pre Clark Update). I've had an asteroid impact event in my game for well over 200 years after I had already destroyed the thing.\n-Only 3 late game crisis and their all horde mode. Horde's that the other AI empires wouldn't even attack(Pre-Clark Patch). You would be the only empire in the galaxy fighting against absolute doomsday and everybody else just sits around declaring war on other AI empires or doing nothing.\n-NO ECONOMY so bad it's almost a joke. Trade is done pretty half ♥♥♥♥♥ but you can expect either paradox to add it in as a free update or charge you money for it in dlc form.\n---ADVERTISED AS A 4X GAME YET IT'S MORE LIKE 3X! The devs are actively trying to limit expansion for their own reasons. Beware of this fact if you like expanding fast in your strategy games.\n-Mid to late game will get ULTRA boring at times since it take's forever to research tech if your a big empire and there's really not too many events left at that point.\n-Lagging in mid to late game\n-Who's bright idea is it to keep shoving unneeded EU4 land based mechanics into a "4x" space game? It doesn't work well in a space setting.\n\nAgain all of this was before the Clark update and I know quite a bit was changed I'm writing this late review for when I finished my last play though off it. The biggest thing that stuck out to me was that instead of fixing  things in the game like lag, events, and sectors they instead focused on nerfing and hindering player strategies to force them to play the game paradox invisioned it to be played instead of letting players do their own thing.\n\nAt this moment the game is beautiful but half ♥♥♥♥♥ in many places and made bare bones so they can sell dlc later on to patch it up. Something I don't take to to kindly too.\n\n5/10. Has massive potential but it just isn't there yet. Buy at your own risk for now but definitely keep an eye out for this one.","June 2","false","120.8"," 24 of 42 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","24","42","0","14"

Review of the initial release.\n\nStellaris is an attempt at fusing the Galactic Civilizations / Masters of Orion games with Europa Universalis. As such, it is fairly successful as a proof of concept. The game has a wide amount of content and great writing. Sadly, under the veneer it is extremely shallow. Basically the game needed another year of development to flesh out. Knowing Paradox, that will actually occur over time and players will be forced to pay for that continued development if they want to play a finished product. This explains and justifies the lower initial price of the game.\n\nI cannot recommend the game in the state that it is in, but I suspect this will change in perhaps 6 months time.\n\nSpecific gripes\n- Diplomacy system is excessively shallow. Think 1\3 of the depth of Civ5.\n- Domestic AI (sectors) are an attempt at reducing micro for large empires and simulating the challenges of a sprawling star empire. They end up being both annoying (unable to micro stuff that needs to be microed even when you want to) and downright infuriating (the ai makes suboptimal choices that limit growth).\n- Allied AIs simply blob up and follow your main fleet instead of doing any thinking at all.\n- Ship designs organization is rudimentary. Probably the most glaring issue. You cannot upgrade ships to different classes; you can only upgrade existing classes. This leads to hair pulling for players used to microing their builds ala Galactic Civilizations.\n- Game UI needs a lot of work.","May 13","false","74.6"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","13","21","0","0"

And once you enter mid-game on a big map, it's becomes awfully tedious to progress.\n\nI still recommend Endless Space, it's so far, on the 4x games that are light on the micro management, it's IMO still the best in the space opera genre.\n\nHonestly, there are too many things missing, the tech tree is missing a lot of the classical techs that any space op game should give us. You can't invest in getting faster terraforming (one step takes 10 years period), you will not be able to terraform barren or tox planets.

For the people that don't own the game, sectors are planets and zones that you give to the AI to manage for you.\nSectors need to build ther own military and need to beable to defend themselves as they take up the stardocks,planets and the resources they generate. Right now, sectors become such a heavy burden when you are big and go to war which defeats the whole of making sectors in the first place.\n\nThe research/tech tree also has no personality. there are no 'unique' techs like wonders in civilization. The game itself has no 'Tree' and instead it gives you 3-4 random research and on your first few play through, you will end up waddling around several 'branches' because there are prerequisites that you have to go through. For example, if you want to unlock devastator missiles, you need to finish all the tiers of nuclear weapons but the game doesnt tell you that.\n\nEvents like civil wars and rebellions also hardly happen unless you mess up big time which is disappointing. Plot blockers such as volcanos or monsters are just for illustration purposes, they do not do anything besides hinder you which doesnt give you a sense of urgency to research and unblock them and instead it is better to just concentrate on expanding all through early game since pirates dont spawn either.\n\nOne thing that makes this game stand out from the rest is it's quest system which is written really well but these seem to disappear when you reach the mid game. Wars are also objective based and you do not war against a 'race' or 'faction' like in other 4X games, which means that if you are in an alliance and the AI declares war on your ally, you cannot stop the war and is forced to participate.\n\nThe combat AI is also rediculously stupid. the AI targts weak and defenseless ships first so if you are going to fight against someone with a larger stack, you just need to embark all your armies 1 by 1 which will become 24hp transport ships and the fleet will attack these ships slowly before deciding to hit your main fleet which would have obliterated the enemy's fleet. (if you have more money, you can design cheap,fast and evasive corvettes which will do more damage instead of transport ships)\n\nThe AI also abuses this which makes it fustrating as you have no control over what happens in combat. (6 battleships that give you around 7-8k MP would lose to a 50 or so corvettes which would be around 4-5k MP, or 8 battleships with 22 destroyers- around 27-28k MPwould lose to 30 transport ships and 50 corvettes/1 battleship- around 11-12k MP)\n\nMP = military power which is used to decide the strength of your units/fleet","May 12","false","8.9"," 28 of 50 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","28","50","2","0"

I have a killer rig, yet the game gets really sluggish even on medium maps towards late game.  It isn't optimized at all.  I thought battle mechanics might need just more time on my end...nope...still trash.  Forget about trying to do a war if the enemies all get "Psi Jump" since you will never even have a chance to engage in a fight...even if you outnumber them 100 to 1.  This game is just horrible...even Endless Space seems like a AAA title compared to this failure from Paradox.\n\n---------\n\n\nUnfortunately I cannot say Stellaris is a good game to try...yet.  It has potential, but overall the game is severely (as in, beta type development) lacking in battle mechanics.  There is no strategy involved nor can you plan for eventual fighting.  There is no espionage, so there is no way of knowing how advanced your foes are, until it is beyond too late.  If you lose a war when you are not warleader, you lose completely with no chance of coming back.   You will see players on forums talking about interchanging weapon modules and tailoring ships to fight you foes...which sounds good (on a forum only) but never works out that way since, as mentioned, you cannot determine what your foes or even allies have going on.\n\nDon't even get started on allies.  Trying to track down their fleet movements is not only a chore, its a game of "Where's Waldo".\n\nParadox has enough experience to know what is an issue with battle mechanics (since that is one of the biggest gripes in every game), but there is absolutely no excuse for the junk they have presented this time.  Of course, we know that they plan to sell features later in DLCs, witholding features that actually would help.\n\nThis is a complete failure and dissapointment from my favorite dev studio.","May 12","false","107.6"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","1"

Think of this game as kind of a Sins of a Solar Empire meets Civilization, though, actually less complex IMO (once again).

Rich, complex, surprising (solving the gretest 4X issue of all playthroughs being more or less identical), each playthrough is different. I expect the "hours on record" figure to gain a couple orders of magnitude in the coming months.\n\nAfter the bland reskins of the Master of Orion concept (GalCiv, Endless, Distant Worlds), this is finally a truly better game moving the genre forward and setting the new standard with a lot of novel mechanics and depth.\n\nMinus side:\n\n-Combat is simplistic and there is no skill involved. Nobody yet did better than Master of Orion 1 twenty years ago.\n\n-Diplomacy is currently completely broken. Like, you offer a civilization a promise you will not attack them, asking nothing in return (in a bid to boost relations), and they will write back that they refuse your ridiculous request.\n\n-Tutorials are broken. After meeting twenty civilizations, having embassies with three of them and trading with them routinely, you will get a "First contact! This changes everything!" message when meeting the twenty first. Broken condition chains happened so often I started completely ignoring the tutorial messages and mini-missions. I expect this to be patched out shortly.\n\n-I am not so sure there is sufficient depth to the various races to make them anything else than reskins with two or three personality variables. Yet to see anything that isn’t "antropomorphic animal with a randomly generated flavoring". To draw the inevitable comparison to MOO again, MOO’s few races suffer from the same furry-convention design uninspiredness, but are strongly defined personality archetypes - in Stellaris, all the dozens of avian/reptilian/fungoid empires blend together, and you don’t get the sense of "hey, these guys are like this, and those guys are that". The claim of many tens of races is therefore kind of devalued by their relative identity. Also making interesting extra races an optional purchase was kind of a ♥♥♥♥ move to begin with - it’s an essential feature if you want the game to be more replayable. If you’re gonna have thirty plus empires on the map, make sure they feel different.\n\n-Research doesn’t feel as profound/consequential/meaningful as in other 4X games. For whatever reason, I don’t get the sense of excitement and discovery that comes with climbing the tech tree in MOO or Civilization, much less Kerbal Space Program. The game doesn’t communicate the longer-term implication of various venues of research very well.\n\nVerdict: kiss your relatives goodbye and buy the game. You’ll get lost for days and weeks. Paradox pulled off something great, and I hope there will be expansions and DLCs.","May 9","true","36.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you like strategy games with a big scaled gameplay, Stellaris is definitely a game for you. You are able to spend hours within the game, building up your empire, constructing buildings on planets and fighting wars on a galactic scale. But the game also has its disadvantages. Some main critic points are:\n- hard to learn\n- game engine is not that well-engineered, it starts to produce lag later in the game\n- the AI (enemy, ally and your own sector managing) sometimes does bad decision or is not able to fullfill its role\n- diplomacy is not that good in combination with the AI\n- mainly designed for singeplayer\n\nBut even with its disadvantages I can still recommend Stellaris and when it hopefully gets patched, it will be even better.\n7.5/10","May 21","true","52.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Not Deep Silver, nor even Ubisoft (LOL).\n\nSome quick outline of the game after ~35hrs of playing with yet unfinished campaign (yes, the game progress really SLOW!)\nThe game feels unfamiliar at the beginning, but soon you'll grasp the essense of the game if you come from EU4 (aka very Clausewitz-ish)\nVery huge galaxy. I went with midium size and I cannot guarantee I have explored all it has to offer\nA lot to do and try early game, which I enjoy the most. Ship designer was initially a blast to me\nBeautiful BGM, with nice British accent assistant\nMet the first alien empire! I tried to be nice, but they are too scared. No, we wont send you to the laboratory...\nThe diplomacy was quite simple, kinda reminded me of Civilization-style diplomacy window. No infiltration, no coveting action, no... royal marriage??? I hope the diplomacy can be more detailed in later patches/DLCs\nThe game gets hard as I expand my empire. I have a great difficulty keeping the balance positive while fulfilling my gorgeous ambitions. Also micromanagement of each planet really reminded me of provincial management in EU4\nThe later it gets, the more similarity of EU4 I can find in this game. You start up weak, you farm, you research, you build navies, you either be aggressive or continue to farm on... until you are the only one in this galaxy\nGreat MOD support. I've been using a few now\nIn fact, I stopped playing DOTA for a few days just because I wanna spend just one more hour in game...\nMinor imba issues. Minor graphics glitches. Minor issue with the launcher. Few functions broken. Acceptable given the game's just released ~10d ago\n*Maybe* less replayability in comparision with EU4?\n\nIn conclusion, the game is pretty stellar at this price.

Single player games suffer from a terribly inactive AI and closed borders, which means there is very often not much to do. To make things worse, lots of the fun associated with micromanaging planet development is gone as you are forced to hand over control to a sloppy AI in the form of sector governors.\n\nEither way, it is very clear that the game in the current state is unfinished and will require many more patches and tweaks to become enjoyable. Having played multiple Paradox titles for many hours, I'm afraid that most of the fixes will come as costly DLC's. ( I am aware that Paradox tends to add a free patch to each DLC release, however, the new gameplay features are almost always exclusive for the DLC, which will definitely be needed here)\n\nNot worth the hefty price tag.","May 17","false","34.9"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","18","31","0","0"

And it's built like 'EU/HOI brought to space', not other way around like 'MOO with EU/HOI upgrade'. And I'm not 100% sure this formula is the best one for the masses.\n\nBe prepared for very complex grand strategy with events, vassals, policies, edicts and complex decisions, e.g. 'should I take +10% research for the cost of -15% ethics divergence and what does it even mean?!' The game is not turn-based but plays like one as you can press pause anytime and you have full control over the speed.\n\nWhat I find particularly appealing in this game: I've never seen anything like this in space and I'm happy such a game is finally here. If most of the fun for you is figuring out how everything works - then this this game is definitely for you. At least that's how it feels for me and I love it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/exodusx/recommended/281990/","exodusx","Exodus53","http://steamcommunity.com/id/exodusx/","288 products in account","So I'm gonna preface this by saying that I am a massive fan of paradox strategy games and I have many many hours into Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis\n\nWhat is Stellaris?\nStellaris is 4x space exploration game In which you command a species that has just managed to create some form of faster than light technology and is ready to explore and colonise the stars, as you expand you will find other similar space faring empires with whom you can form alliances with or wage war. You can also research technologies in a quasi-random manner (explained later) and design your own vessels from scratch in the ship designer.\n\n\nI want to start this review off by stating clearly that Stellaris feels unfinished and needs polish. There is room for improvement everywhere from the combat, diplomacy, to the management of your empire. I have over the course of my playthroughs noticed fairly commonly assets appearing where they shouldn't such as the center of the galaxy being a missle, some assets not dissapearing such as the visual effects from the ships FTL drives which at one point lead to me to believe during a war that my opponents fleet was in a entirely different place than where it actually was. Speaking of war, AI is a bit strange during war, allies tend to rush to you and stick to your fleets instead of doing independent activities which is annoying because It means you'll probably have to guide their navies around or they'll end up losing. During lategame crisies such as Invaders from a different dimension the AI doesnt really care to send their fleets to attack their home system, meaning that if you are playing singleplayer you'll probably have to fight them all off yourself and the sectors that you can use to automate parts of your empire really need more options.\n\nNow that I've explained that to you lets begin.\n\nThe planet management I'll go over firstly, planets are based on tiles and citizens work these tiles, some tiles may have a bonus to a certain type of resource like maybe one tile gives +1 Food even though nothing is built upon it, It's very Civilisation like in this manner, requiring a surplus of food to get new citizens and then being able to build farms, mines, research labs, military acadamies ect ect, the number of these tiles depends of the planets size, the size meaning how many there are. There Is nothing particularry wrong with it but there is one minor gripe that I have and that is that planets don't differ in how much minerals they have or how fertile they are. A barren planet is just as good at producing food as a tropical one is which is a bit strange, I first thought that the "habitability" of a planet was how fertile it was but actually it's just what the maximum happiness is but aside from that minor gripe I have, I actually had a bit of fun min-maxing planets to do certain goals like minerals or research.\n\nSpecies and empire creation is suprisingly indepth allowing you to create a species and an empire from scratch. You create a species select their appearence from a wide variety of options and give them traits for example one of my games I was playing as a Avian race that was industrious and dilligent at work but were weak at ground combat, then you create their government. You can select their ethics which is basicly what their society believes in. As in, are you millitaristic or pacifists, Spiritualistic or Materialist ect ect. Normally most of the time Empires have 2 ethics one of which is a extreme version of one (EG: Fanatic Pacifist and Individualist but you can have 3 at maximum (Pacifist, Materialistic and Induvidualist to give an example) these change the options during events and give bonuses. Once you have selected your ethics you then select a government type that Is based upon those ethics, So If I picked militaristic I can be a Dictatorship, or  Moral Democracy If I picked Pacifist. There are quite a large number of different government types and I was really surpised by just how many options there were, I mean you even get to choose what the cities look like which are only ever seen when you are looking at the planet overview menu.\n\nThere is no real goal that the game sets for you to accomplish which is similar to other Paradox titles, instead you set your own goals and try and accomplish them, I personally enjoy to role-play who I am playing as. Which Stellaris lets you do very nicely thanks to it's ethics system, I think the way that ethics work is great for people who like to role-play and I enjoyed playing as a Fanatic Collectivist and Xenophobic hivemind hell bent on the continued existance of my species and mine alone regardless of the cost.. The ethics sytem isnt just good for roleplaying though, as AI empires are randomized It meant that every time I played I never found the same nation or species twice. One game my neighbors were federation builders who wanted to create an alliance with me, the next I was surronded by millitaristic expansionist empires and constantly fought wars and had to prioritize millitary research tech as I tried to survive. I never felt bored when I was starting a new game and I was never in the same situation twice which I absolutely love as it make the game very replayable, although It is worth stating that if you are not role-playing you may end up feeling restricted by the ethics system as It means at certain times you can't do certain things and It may even be a detriment at times.\n\nNow research is a bit weird. I mentioned earlier that you can research technologies in a "quasi-random manner" and I'm gonna simplify it a tiny bit If you want a indepth explanation then check the Stellaris wiki page. Now. In Stellaris you have 3 areas of technology, Physics, Society and Engineering, now Stellaris doesn't really have a tech tree instead once you have researched a technology 3 new ones appear at random for you to select, at the start of the game some techs are coded to always appear for example the tech that allows you to build colony ships will always appear at the start but past that it is all random but some techs are weighted to appear more than others. Now personally I'm a bit 50-50 on this system because while it does mean that there is alot of varience in terms of what different empires are good or bad at, It meant that quite a few times RNG utterly screwed me and I didnt get any of the techs to build bigger ships which eventually lead to a war and then I entered a death spiral which eventually left me defeated. However you can reduce this RNG through reverse engineering, after a battle, destroyed ships turn into debris and researching it does two things, firstly is adds a percentage of research progress to whatever technology the ship had on it like better missles or shields and secondly makes those techs always avaliable to research, untill they are researched which is a good way of balancing out the RNG aspect.\n\nThe ship designer is pretty good, you create a ship based on modules called sectors these sectors have inside them differing numbers of slots of differing sizes and It also varies the look of the ships depending on what sectors you have selected for them which Is a nice touch. In general you can add stuff to you ship such as shields, armour, weapons and power supplies. There is only one main issue with the ship designer and that Is that the auto-generated ships tend to be rubbish so It's probably for the best that you design the ships yourself.\n\nApparently I've hit the character limit so here is very brief conclusion.\n\nSteam needs neutral reviews. I personally utterly adore Stellaris as It scratches an itch that I've had for a while but at the moment it needs polish and a lot of it. If you want to buy It but are even the slighest bit unsure then wait for the patches and DLC to come in a few months and then determine if it's worth it.","May 15","true","65.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

But don't forget, this is a Paradox game, so we can actually be pretty sure they'll look into it and in few months we'll have absolutely perfect game.\n\nThose are the complaints. However the atmosphere, nice learning curve, plentiful of events, race designer and possibilites are more than good. If you ever wanted to have true sequel to Master Of Orion 2, this is it (although in real-time). Even though mid-game is little bit sluggish (again, nothing that Paradox wouldn't fix either in patches or expected DLCs), the game is fun as hell and you'll definitely lose your sense in time in real life.\n\nSo yeah, there are some issues but nothing that would ruin your experience or was inherent to the game itself.

The easiest and shortest way to describe this is a "Europa Universalis in Space" type of game. And Im loving it!\n\nThere are features and mechanics that sometimes feel a bit shallow (Alliance/Federation Tools/Options), which is where I hope Paradox can deliver some amazing expansions as they usually do with their other Grand Strategy titles, to expand and give more depth and complexity, but also more control to the players.\n\nThen there are other features such as the ship design, where you have so much control and complexity that you can spend hours just designing your space ships to be the perfect tool for an upcoming war.\n\nI got 22 hours in so far, which I have accumulated over 2-3 days of playing. (One which was 11 hours straight!) And it feels like Im still scratching the surface, yet I have had so much fun with it.\n\nI highly recommend Stellaris, if you know you enjoy Grand Strategy games such as Europa Universalis, which now takes its place in space.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the fact its highly modable! Meaning there are already plenty of Mods in the works by the community. The talk about total conversion mods in the themes of Star Wars and Mass Effect has me so exited I dont know what to do.\n\nPS: This is the type of game, that if you get into it, it will be as if you stepped into a time machine, cause you wont know where time has gone when you then look at the clock!","May 9","true","39.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Well, this time, my review is different. This time, it is going to shine!\n\nEnough of that. Stellaris is a exploration and grand strategy game set in space. You can create any species (or use the ones already there) and explore the galaxy. Galaxies can have up to 1000 stars, but you can decrease this number. The game does have some flaws. For example, the sector system doesn\'t give me as much control over planets as I want to have, and the sector governer AI is not the best. But, Paradox is known for vastly improving their games after release with both free patches and paid expansions.\n\n\nOn a final note, the game is in need of polishing, but it is fun for those who want some stellar action and exploration.","June 1","true","60.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

What MOO did to create it, MOO2 did to advance it, and MOO3 did to kill it (and, despite a few solid attempts between then and now, such as GalCiv, StarDrive, Distant Worlds, Space Empires and Endless Space, to name just a few), this game actually revives the entire type of game and turns it from a who can grow the fastest and out-build everybody else into an actual strategy game.\n\nTake it with a grain of salt, though.  The game is new, there are some bugs (some still game breaking) and there is a lot of room for improvement.  But, Paradox being Paradox, that is coming, and coming SOON.

I only bought the game a few days ago because I started watching some game plays on Youtube.\nI have to say, this game is everything I was looking for and more. I wanted a game where I could start a space empire and rule the galaxy, and Stellaris is that and everything more. From an enormous 300+ technology hodgepodge (not a tech tree) that you can study throughout your session, to an in depth ship designing page, to an intense foriegn diplomacy tango.\nThe other night as I was playing, I was being beaten down by a powerful opponent who had a much larger navy than I. It was only when my allies came together and helped me defeat them was I savved. The whole experience was very "anime style fights where the bad guy is beaten by the power of friendship."\nThe only factor that I really did not like from this game, was the fact that I ended up staying awake 'till 2am two nights in a row. I had to force myself to stop playing. Once you start playing Stellaris you can not stop. I am just glad I did not have work the next day.\nHighly recommend this game to anyone who is into Civ V, the Total War series, FTL, even Warhammer 40k.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crimsonstout/recommended/281990/","Crimsonstout","_mZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crimsonstout/","108 products in account","Well, without putting too fine a point on it, this game has gripped me like no other game this year. It's been a long time since I was as enthusiastic about anything as I am about Stellaris.\n\nFrom the moment I started playing, I was hooked. My first empire was a collection of racist, collectivist insects that came to dominate the spiral arm they were born on within 150 years. Then I managed to ♥♥♥♥ off a Fallen Empire, who promptly destroyed all of my ships in a very one-sided war. Everyone else I'd annoyed with my earlier expansion (and constant genocide...) decided to jump in and take me to pieces like hyenas at a carcass.\n\nI had a few more non-starter games where I was crushed before the century was out, (protip: if you don't feel like having this happen, you can turn 'advanced AI starts down and lower the chances you'll start next to someone big who hates you for existing) but then I decided to roll chill science-y space lizards.\n\nNow, this is where I have problems with the game in its current form. It was easy from an RP perspective to knock out the empires around me who wanted me dead and burned, but once all of them were gone and I had nothing but nice neighbours, there was pretty much nothing to do. Some of them would have joined an alliance with me, but for some reason that reduces your influence per month, which I needed for lots of things. The rest of them pretty much didn't want anything to do with me. I couldn't travel through their territory with my science ships because we weren't allies, and we couldn't be allies because I needed the influence/they weren't up for it. Which left me having to declare nonsensical wars just to be able to spread out a bit.\n\nThere's a lot been said about how the diplomacy side is lacking, and I think that's probably the root of my problems. The other stuff, (strangely scaled UI, combat looking really strange, no map filters) I could either live without or mod in, but not having anything to do in the mid-game is not really something modders can fix.\n\nI'm pretty confident PDX are going to support Stellaris for a long time, and I doubt they'll leave things the way they are for long, but I guess it's a bit of an oversight to have the middle portion of the game have almost nothing to do in it. Especially considering the endgame crises are excellent (if they fire properly) and early game is serious fun.\n\nShould you buy this game? That depends. I've put nearly 100 hours in since release, and I don't regret it. As a reader of classic sci-fi, an ex-40k player and a keen fan of Paradox Interactive, I'm probably going to be a little bit biased. This is essentially an early Christmas for me.\n\nHowever, the polish just isn't there. If you're on the fence (and you probably are, if you're reading this review) I'd advise you to wait a few months before you dive in, or maybe wait until a sale. If you're not too bothered by the things I've mentioned above and are as massive a science fiction fan as I am, you should just buy it already.","May 25","true","103.2"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","20","35","0","0"

It's just a bunch of trivial comparisons and a huge game of whackamole.\n\n"rrr me need energy...me take"...."rrr he bigger than me...me fight later"....."me need ships...me click more..."\n\nEvery single person playing the game, plays it the exact same way, if they are playing the same ethos. There are no decisions, strategies, or tactics, beyond the basic game mechanics and comparisons. If we took 50 random people to write up a "strategy guide" on thier own, they would all look exactly the same.\n\nYou will spend the first 8 hours or so clicking your science vessels to go explore to the reaches of thier range, finding asteroid and planets to build stations on, clicking your construction ship to go build them, clicking and staring, clicking and staring, watching your resource counters inch up bit by bit. You could build some colony ships to go inhabit other planets, and then you click and stare some more as you follow the linear progression of buildings on the tiles of each planet, watching your resources inch up some more.\n\nYou choose from a random draw of techs for each of your 3 slots. The game draws from a weighted deck and gives you a few options to choose from each time a tech is done researching. This limits your strategy and decision making even more. You simply choose whatever is most advantageous at the moment. No real though involved. In this manner, they force you to have a "different playstyle" each playthrough, but it really just equates to a random roll deciding whether you'll build your economy or war machine first.\n\nAfter the initial entire day or night of set-up, you get to click and stare some more, as you slowly build your fleet of ships. Perhaps you spotted another AI to go and kill. So you click and stare until your fleet cap is met. Maybe you have to make the really hard decision of assigning a governor to your planets or a admiral to your ship, to get some %5 bonuses. Oh which to choose?!\n\nThen you go pummel your neighbor. Depending on the ethos of your race, you either assimilate them, enslave them, or purge them. If you choose the wrong one, they rebel and you lose all the ♥♥♥♥ you just spent hours taking. Don't worry though, its pretty obvious which you choose. If you can fire 2 brain cells, you got this!\n\nNow you've taken your neighbor. Repeat the setup cycle again. Click and stare, until every asteroid and planet is mined and everything within range is explored.\n\nNow attack someone else. Decision time! Real strategy! Is he bigger than you? If so, attack someone else. You got this!\n\nYou can add the complexity of AIs forming alliances and federations, banding together to defeat you. I suppose you can fire up brain cell #4 and try to see this coming based on thier ethos and relation to you. Decide which to attack first and which to leave for later. Maybe you want to ally with someone yourself. You can do it!\n\nThe diplomacy is binary. They accept or they don't. Pretty much, you just trade one resource for another at a set rate, for a loss, with anyone who matches your ethos. Everyone else will tell you to ♥♥♥♥ off. You can ally if you like, but then the AI is just going to spam you with useless and worthless wars he wants to get into across the map.\n\nIt has a ton of scripted events, that give you resources, bonuses to the potentiual resources, or maybe they just kill your level 5 scientist. If you enjoy reading until your eyes bleed, you may...then a dice will be rolled.\n\nCombat consists of your fleet and the enemy fleet charging at eachother then you watching as they slowly eat up one another's hp and shields. the only interaction you have during combat is whether or not to hit the "retreat" button, in which case you jump to a neighboring system and they chase you.\n\nThe game has a FTL system consisting of warp, hyper drive, and worm holes. You choose yours at game start. The problem is, all of these are so fast that both you and the AI will be blowing up each other's systems all over the map and leaving before anyone can get to you. It takes about 3 seconds to wipe a system. When you see the enemy coming, hit the button and *poof*. This makes playing the AI a game of wahck-a-mole. It makes multiplayer completely worthless, as you will end up sniping each other until you are both staring at one another from your homeworld. There is no warp blocker of any kind.\n\nThat's pretty much it. A very long a mundane game, even on small maps. You just click and stare, step by step, through the linear path to victory. See a red blip, go chase it...he warped...go chase it more. Until you own the galaxy.\n\nFor a "grand strategy in space", I don't see any strategy here. I could of watched an entire TV series while playing if I didn't have to click so damn much.","May 13","false","51.2"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","21","37","4","1"

I don't know if they do this on purpose or just throw a half-baked idea out there and see where the players ask for things to be filled in later. The ability to create a race is neat but doesn't seem to make much difference that I've seen since you can pick any type of race and the traits which create the modifiers are available to any race whether a cat person or a fungus person.\n\nThe AI players are incredibly passive and their war strategy boils down to making a huge fleet and launching it at you. If you can beat that giant fleet you win every time and they will just spend the rest of the war sending ships at you piecemeal as they complete them and you can just go planet to planet picking off the enemy where you want. The AI is also quite happy to surrender after a few setbacks I've yet to see one fight to anything like a proper ending.\n\nYou are allowed to conquer only so many planets after that limit it goes to the AI controlled sectors that the AI can't properly manage you will be reduced to tears as you watch how poorly a job the AI does with your conquered/colonized planets.\n\nShip designer is pick parts A,B,C and not nearly as awesome as the designer in Galactic Civilizations.\n\nDiplomacy is worthless and the AI basically greets you when you discover them and then ignores you until war is declared.\n\nOkay enough complaining what doesn't suck?\n\nThe random events are pretty neat.\n\nYour colonists will gradually evolve on their own forming new factions or even literally evolving into distinct races on their own and leading to infighting which will destroy buildings or lead to race wars costing countless lives.\n\nThe research tree is clever you pretty much get the same techs each game but they are unlocked in different orders so you can't just rush the same techs every game since some are offered earlier or later (even MUCH later) than others each time.\n\nYou can replace your people with robots that will happily toil on ice covered worlds without complaining like your lazy organic subjects do.\n\nYou can move populations from planet to planet or launch a genocide to purge less cooperative factions or races you've conquered that don't appreciate your rule. Bird people not digging your fungus despotism? Kill 'em all. Replace them with robots.\n\n\nThere is much to like but much that is awful or not quite there if you want a fully fleshed out alternative to Galactic Civilizations (my benchmark for space 4X goodness) this isn't it. In time I think this game will give Galactic Civilizations a run for their money but at this point it is a "meh". A good "meh" but still a "meh".","May 23","true","19.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

I have restarted about 12 times because I wanted to try variations on traits and personalities but I like the universe I am in this time so I might finish in this one although I think it will take some time.  It is fun colonizing planets and negotiating (or killing) your alien neighbors.  I was collecting life forms but I new I needed border access to a neighbor to get the last one.  They weren't willing to let me in but my allies declared war on them and when we won I could send my science ship in to get it :)\n\nClearing out monsters and keeping your economy balanced takes a bit of work but it is fun and keeps you thinking.  I almost saved a planet from deadly plants that started out making my colonists happier by "co-existing" with them until they mutated and turned the planet into a toxic wasteland.  So sad for the colonists...\n\nI really like the game so far and will keep playing it for some time.\n\nThe steam achievements only seem to work on ironman hmm oh well I don't care so much maybe later...  Check out youtube Stellaris Blorg.  If you like what you see then you will like this game.\n\nUpdate over 100 hours still playing...  Asteroids are much easier to stop when you have a massive fleet instead of three corvettes busy running around doing other stuff.  Many empires have joined our federation.  Many others are fearful.  Some we have eased the fear by vassalizing >:)   Now they do what I want.  Never have enough energy credits still lots of planets to colonize.  Still having fun.\n\nOne thing that would be nice would be if there were some differences to races other than the pictures.  Basically you can make any race do any thing-it might be more fun to pick a race and see how that works for you with a predefined trait (and encounter them in the game).  All races are the same no matter what they look like though.\n\nStill only a minor issue really.  Might add to this later-going to play now!\n\nUpdate:  Empire now spans almost half the galaxy.  Every so often we find someone to have a border skirmish with (either when I am Federation President to make another vassal  or when one of my other fed members becomes aggressive).  Major problems energy drain from massive infrastructure and fleet size (almost 100k altogether) draining over 214 energy per month after allowing for all my income.  Fortunately there are other empires with extra energy that kinda say they like me (possibly because I vassalized them...).  I think the big problem is this huge fleet though.  Hmm what to do about that?  Suddenly a huge dimensional rift opened up with nasty aliens that want to eat everybody.  I have a plan for all these extra ships now.  Maybe I won't have to pay so much maintenance if the aliens wreck some...","May 23","true","169.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

They are impossible to keep happy.\n\n-Planet cap- depending on the government you can only control about 5 planets. You have to create sectors. This also really sucks, I wish there was an option to disable the requirment.\n\n-One fleet to rule them all- This game really comes down to who can build the big super fleet first. Use that fleet to destroy your neigbors fleet and they are defense less. No satalites or planet defenses of any kind. You don't have to conqure your neigbors to win. You can just destroy their stuff and they will always be behind you.\n\n-Long times of boringness... You are stuck doing nothing for loooonnnggg periods of time.

Not in that they cant be changed or anything but rather certain traits handcuff you to a governemnt. this is just my one little gripe, but you may find it suffciant.\n\nThe tutorial eases you in decently. some paradox games will throw you into the fire with bare minimum knowledge, which i am critical of, but stellaris sufficiantly gave it some effort. not great but enough.\n\nlike most other paradox games, its going to take awhile to learn the game in and out, theres a massive amount to memorize and keep track of at once.(which leads me into the next part)\n\nWhen i play a game like civ, after i grow to a extremely large nation i tend to get bored maintaning every fabric of my nation. stellaris takes out this extra maintenance by allowing you to add sectors. basically the system is a very simple version of the one used in CK2. you simply select the area of the sector and if you please, assign a governer, and the system will competently handle work in that sector. super simple, and sooooo helpful.\n\nfor those of you who love mods, be at home, paradox will let you do whatever you want. although i only run 1 mod in stellaris and its purely a visual mod (Zbuetiful battles mod). to contrast this game to a game i believe to be sub par. i run that 1 visual mod to run stellaris, while when i play XCOM 2 i usually run about 20+ mods at once. this is just a testment to how good stellaris is, it really doesnt need tweaking.\n\nBecause the game is so flexable customization wise, i can see this game before modding to have tremendous replay value. once you add mods you could probably play this until your PC dies (or you do)\n\n100% recommend this game for the freedom to take your nation wherever it wants in small details or larger ideas.","May 25","true","33.4"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","23","41","0","0"

(The review will be updated in a years time after the 1st dlc arrives) After playing for a little over a hundred hours I think I've seen enough to give a fair opinion. The game is a bare bones 4x(if you can even call it that).\n\n+A variety of special events and lore activities like the ones in CK2 and EU4\n+Looks beautiful especially the space battles best looking paradox game to date!\n+Nothing more satisfying than looking at that cool ARC emitter you spent years researching blasting the face off of that that enemy battle ship at long range.\n\nAnd that there is pretty much where the praises end:\n\n-Diplomacy is so lacking it's pathetic and there's only 2 war options liberate and cede planet.\n-AI is bad all around especially when it comes to sectors.\n-Sectors are just a black hole where you dump planets and forget about them. They have NO events to speak of.\n-Needs more events! You'll see some events more than a dozen times throughout a single game.\n-Lot's of broken events (Pre Clark Update). I've had an asteroid impact event in my game for well over 200 years after I had already destroyed the thing.\n-Only 3 late game crisis and their all horde mode. Horde's that the other AI empires wouldn't even attack(Pre-Clark Patch). You would be the only empire in the galaxy fighting against absolute doomsday and everybody else just sits around declaring war on other AI empires or doing nothing.\n-NO ECONOMY so bad it's almost a joke. Trade is done pretty half ♥♥♥♥♥ but you can expect either paradox to add it in as a free update or charge you money for it in dlc form.\n---ADVERTISED AS A 4X GAME YET IT'S MORE LIKE 3X! The devs are actively trying to limit expansion for their own reasons. Beware of this fact if you like expanding fast in your strategy games.\n-Mid to late game will get ULTRA boring at times since it take's forever to research tech if your a big empire and there's really not too many events left at that point.\n-Lagging in mid to late game\n-Who's bright idea is it to keep shoving unneeded EU4 land based mechanics into a "4x" space game? It doesn't work well in a space setting.\n\nAgain all of this was before the Clark update and I know quite a bit was changed I'm writing this late review for when I finished my last play though off it. The biggest thing that stuck out to me was that instead of fixing  things in the game like lag, events, and sectors they instead focused on nerfing and hindering player strategies to force them to play the game paradox invisioned it to be played instead of letting players do their own thing.\n\nAt this moment the game is beautiful but half ♥♥♥♥♥ in many places and made bare bones so they can sell dlc later on to patch it up. Something I don't take to to kindly too.\n\n5/10. Has massive potential but it just isn't there yet.

You really try to get any bonus. Exploring is really intense. You are always looking out for a good planet to colonize and you try to get any bonus by investigating every anomaly. There are many different anomalies out there, but not enough for a second game session or for a long game on a big map.\n\nWhen you overcome all the other equal starting empires, there is no real threat (except for some special events), because the ancient empires are passive and you can engage them, when you are really ready to fight them.\n\nAlso the K.I. is really bad in wars. Allied empires only support you. They don't really try to make any own moves, they only follow your fleet.\nThe Battles look great in the early game, when your fleets are small. But when the fleets get bigger, the game will stutter. No matter how good your PC is, at some point your game will stutter.\nDuring war you don't have many possibilities, you only have the decisions to send your ships in the right moment in. Everything else is decided by your ship layout and amount of ships.\nI also had many really nasty bugs. For example my main fleet engaged the enemy main fleet, but they were both too far away from each other to shoot at each other. So nothing happened. I was only able to send in new fleets from behind to engage them. Luckily I was strong enough to build up a fleet which was able to destroy the enemy fleet. Really this was the worst bug ever.\n\nSo listen to my advice and wait! Don't buy it yet. It still has many bugs. And wait until it is cheaper and until Paradox finishes this game with some more DLCs.","May 13","false","53.1"," 30 of 55 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","30","55","2","0"

Paradox have made a hybrid of a 4x and their traditional Grand Strategy titles (with a facelift) and it works quite well. The focus on diplomacy, the semi-random tech system, highly customisable races and the end game events keep playthroughs quite fresh; which is much more than you can say for other games with this setting - I'm looking at you Masters of Orion! Easy drop-in multiplayer make it a fantastic pick if you've got a few friends who're into strategy gaming.\n\nIt's not perfect, but with future expansions lined up and full mod support from day 1... maybe one day it'll be pretty close to it.

Compared to Paradoxes other grand strategies this one is fairly easy to learn and just generally get into, the resource management isn't very hard and could almost be compared to the Civilization series with the "unique" resources for specific buildings, just as Civ as resources for units. Simple currency management is another thing Stellaris has, it's simple really just make sure your economy can sustain your navies, mining/research stations and buildings on your planet and everything will be alright just to note there is two different type of currencies, Minerals and Energy Credits there isn't a major difference other than the fact they both are used as upkeep for your navies, credits are used for Buildings, stations and armies, as you can tell it's fairly simple just make sure it's not in the minus and you'll be fine.There is also 3 different type of research points you can use to increase research but that's pretty self explanatory if you get the game.\n\nNow, when (and if) you get the game you won't actually have a tutorial unlike most other Paradox titles which normally have a tutorial of sorts, Stellaris offers you a robot called VIR that will help you by giving you tips and giving you a brief explanation of almost everything. A few examples of this is if you were to click on your navy, VIR will give you a brief idea of what a navy does and how you can expand it and upgrade it. The mechanics of Stellaris is fairly simple, in about 20 hours of a singeplayer game I got the general idea of the basics, at 40 hours I now have a general understanding of most techs and how the game plays such as how to expand and what not.  The game isn't hard to get into but if you've played previous titles by Paradox you will almost feel at home with their simple and easy to navigate UI system. Though the game may seem like you'll get bored there is a lot to do and the empire creator aspect of this game is easily one of the best things currently in it.\n\nThe game at the moment is well worth it's price but some people don't think it has much to offer even though it is a pretty huge game. at the moment I'd recommed it for it's current price range. And if you're worried about something you read on a website or another review about lack of content or bugs, paradox is currently working on patches and will almost always work on patches to keep the game bug free and add fresh content that people have requested. (They're currently working on a patch right now that'll add more feautures to the empire creator. 19th/May/2016)\n\nMy personel opinion on the game\nFor  Singeplayer. It's a solid 6/10. The game, as it stands doesn't have the best diplomacy with A.l. It can be quite boring as it's easy to beat the AI unless you're at a major disadvantage. Though to shine some light on Singeplayer, they have more missions that you'll receive as you go on playing the game. Also playing ironman to get achievements is nice if you want to try and get a few.\n\nFor Multiplayer. It's around about 8-9/10. Multiplayer is very fun at the moment, it's probably going to be one of the only times you'll experience a real space battle with tactics and mixed weaponary as the AI just doesn't seem to do that. Diplomacy can work slighty better than how it would with the AI and alliances/federations will become something people might need to survive or just to prevent a intergalactic war from happening. (Also conflict is amazing when you steal someones planet they wanted to colonize.)\n\nOverall if you want a fairly simple and fun Grand Strategy made by one of the best Game Development companies out there, I wholeheartedly recommend you to purchase this, if you don't think it's worth it's price I recommend you  at the least wishlist it and wait for a sale to pop up and then get it.","May 19","true","46.5"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","15","26","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NaztyFox/recommended/281990/","NaztyFox","Nazty Fox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NaztyFox/","4270 products in account","I put 40 hours into this game within the first week of having it. That's a full work week, but to be fair I was sick...\n\nThis is one of the best 4x strategy games I have ever had the pleasure of picking up and playing. Once you get your hands on this game it will be extremely difficult to put it down. I've already dedicated 2 full nights to this game and see many more in the future.\n\nStellaris can be intimidating when you first start playing. I'm a fan of 4x strategy and even I was a little wary of everything going on in this game. The good thing is that Paradox crafted an amazing tutorial that guides you through everything you need to know. I definitely recommend turning the tutorial to full even if you have 4x experience. Don't expect to crush the AI the first time you play either. While the tutorial is great there is so much depth to the game that it takes a few playthroughs to start figuring out your play style and how best to play it.\n\nYou start off by selecting your empire. You can choose from a bunch of preset empires or you can craft your own. I definitely suggest crafting your own, it's entertaining and you can really tailor the empire to your needs. A quick tip from me, wormhole is one of the better travel options in my opinion. It’s not a hard concept so don't be off-put by the (advanced players) tag attached to it.\n\nOnce you're done fine tuning your empire it's time to choose your "map/galaxy". You have different map sizes to choose from, the amount of players/factions (30+). the shape of the map, how many AI get to start off better than you, difficulty, and if you want to play Iron Man (Auto-save only). If you are looking to unlock achievements, then you need to play in Iron Man mode. If you want to use console commands or save whenever to be able to reload and make better decisions, then turn Iron Man off.\n\nNow that you have the game ready to go it is time to start your adventure in an unknown galaxy. You get plopped into a random star system in the galaxy and begin your journey. Your AI robot will pop up and this is where you go full/tips only/none for tutorial. The robot I found to be a wonderful companion, I loved the dialogue and his duty to helping you understand the vastness of everything ahead of you.\n\nYou get a home planet, a starting spaceport, a construction ship, a science vessel, and a fleet of 3 corvette ships. You begin by surveying your system, then building another science vessel and surveying some more. In fact, you spend A LOT of time in this game surveying. You need to get out there and discover everything that is amazing and fun. You will run into some very interesting dialogues and quest lines from surveying. It’s important to know everything you can know about everything going on around you.\n\nYou also start the process of building and expanding your empire. You build a few mining stations in your system and mining nodes on your home planet to start that cash flow rolling in. There are 2 places you build. Upon the surface of any planets you have colonized, and in the orbit of stars and planets in the systems you explore. You need to find that healthy balance of energy and minerals to keep your empire going.\n\nInfluence is another resource you get as well. It is very slow in the early game to accumulate and certain things like alliances will drain your influence even more. It is one of your most valuable resources. You need it to expand your borders, to recruit leaders, and to setup policies and edicts that help your style of play and help you adapt to what’s going on around you.\n\nYour leaders are very important as well. You need them to govern your planets and sectors, to research new technologies, to man your science vessels, and to lead your armies. You start off with a few already but will soon need to recruit more with the influence you have gained. They level up as you use them and gain their own traits as well. They do age and die so they all have expiration dates which means you will always need some influence to recruit more. It's sad when you lose that scientist who hit 5 stars and basically excelled you through years of research by surveying tech in the vastness of space.\n\nAs you expand you begin to make contact with your neighbors. If you are lucky you run into more peaceful/tolerable aliens at first. This allows you to initiate the first move. Do you want to take them out or do you want to use them as a potential ally? There is only so much space and everyone is growing so eventually you will have to take someone out to be able to expand more yourself.\n\nWith that being said, don't rush into any wars. You need to plan everything out before you launch an all-out assault. Make sure your fleet capacity is at full and you have an attack plan. Also be sure to have enough cash flow to afford the war. You can't fight if you are broke. Be ready for the AI to warp to your home system while you are in the middle of attacking theirs. The AI can be devious like that sometimes. War isn't easy and you spend a lot of time attacking then licking wounds then attacking again.\n\nYour first war is usually the easiest. Lesser techs and less to deal with. Once you get into alliances and federations, you start getting into warfare like you've never seen before. Things get crazy and the wars seem to last forever. You better hope you chose the right allies. My second war I was severely under-powered for and I lost horribly. It was basically game over and time to start fresh again.\n\nThis game takes some time to master and you will most likely lose your first few games before you start making head way but you won't care because you will be having fun the entire time.\n\nThis game offers a lot of depth and detail and a rich environment to experience it all in. You can easily lose hours upon hours to this game and care less about where the time has gone. If you are a fan of 4x strategy or even if you are playing for the first time, then this is the game for you. It is worth every penny and we still have more content to look forward too.","May 16","true","50.1"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","1"

The start was fun, but it became a grind really quickly. The management part seems to scale pretty badly with the empire size. The UI becomes rather clunky too. There are no lists of colonizable planets and no lists of shipyards. Controlling your science and construction ships becomes chore, with no decisionmaking involved what sovever. In battles tactics aren't involved aswell. Thats somewhat in the tradition of paradox games. But that doesn't cut it for me in a space title. I want awesome space battles ...\nI played one game for 8 hours now, and i dont feel like i made any intresting choices. Compared to EU or Crusader Kings the game seems to be pretty plain. I don't feel like there is any reason to go back to it. I would have expected more from paradox and that they learned some more lessons from titles like Distant Worlds. If something the player has to do can be easily automated and does not involve decisionmaking, he shouldn't have to do it in the first place.

It will alter your entire game and your playstyle for that game. It's probably what makes Stellaris great to be honest.\n\nAfter having set up your species and started the game, that initial burst of exploration and expansion is executed almost perfectly. Sending out your science ship to survey and explore other systems isn't just some mindless task of clicking from one system to the next as anomalies and research projects pop up in your situation log. This leads it to be far more immersive than any other 4X space game I know of at the moment, leading to weird and sometimes exciting events such as a brand of ultra-reactionary religious quacks breaking off from your empire to take a stand against your purging policy. Or your scientists finding a ceramic pot drifting around a sun that they just.. Can't explain. All this means that exploration isn't just "oh. a planet to colonise, great. NEXT SYSTEM."\n\nThe land grab stage is also done incredibly well as you aim to cut off your opponents in a desperate grab for planets and minerals. Establishing frontier outposts and desperately trying to build colony ships in order to expand your borders. But make no mistake, there is no need for you to grab as much as you can. I've been three times the size of the AI and they've STILL had superior tech and equivelant fleet power/capacity to me. It's possible to build not just wide, but tall and that's done so well in the this game, in comparison to other games such as Sins of a Solar Empire where it's alllllll about the wide.\n\nColonising is a relatively simple affair of sending your colony ship to X habitable planet, then settling there, waiting a year or two for it to be established and then bam, you have your colony; planets however aren't just things that set down borders, they'll be your main income for science/minerals/energy if you min/max one or the other. Every planet has a planet surface tab, which is divided into multiple squares consisting of as little as 5 up to 25 and this is where it starts to look a bit like Civ. Each tile has a natural resource within it which can either be exploited or ignored and built over to provide a different resource, in order to harvest said resource the tile requires an active pop be living on it; which are grown through the amount of food you have (Currently there is no point to having a surplus of food on a fully popped planet). Pops can be resettled between different planets within your core sector allowing you to keep your eithical bloodline pure.\n\nNow, many 4X games descend into tedious micro-management of -every- planet and system that you own, which obviously a lot of people aren't all that in to. Some like spreadsheets, some don't. Stellaris attempts to alleviate this with something I've not seen in other space games as of yet, it allows you to break up your empire into "sectors", the number of sectors allowed is based on your population and planets owned. This sector is essentially an AI which will manage and govern the area you portion out to it. You can choose to assign each sector a governor who will convey specific bonuses to the entire sector. The sector doesn't just micromanage the planets though; you can allow it to redevelopment tiles on planets, and set it a specific function; such as military, minerals, research or credits. The sector AI will then attempt to do it's utmost best to supply as much of the chosen function as possible, except for military sector AI who will build military stations and strengthen their borders with space-station defenses, defending armies, etc. A lot of people have moaned that the sector AI seems woefully incompetent and doesn't really seem able to balance itself out; now this is incorrect, at the start you may notice that it is minus on energy credits for a while, this is because it doesn't have it's planets infrastructures built yet; simply pour minerals and energy into it and you'll see it even out, and eventually it'll even surpass itself. I've been provided with up to 400+ minerals by my sectors alone at times. They really do become incredibly good.\n\nAs time goes by it starts to morph into a GSG more than a 4X game, with an emphasis on war and diplomacy. They're not as fleshed out as a lot of people were hoping for. I was expecting what we got since I read all the DD's and didn't expect anything more. War is a very set in stone thing. You declare war for specific wargoals such as cede X planet, and liberate X planets. Then it's simply a march to your wargoal (gained through winning batles, capturing planets, etc). 90% of the time the AI will surrender and hand it over to you should you be utterly stomping them. If they're winning however, they will go on winning unless you surrender and give them your systems. This is a rather brutal AI in that respect. Many however have complained that the AI seems overly passive, and while this can be the case it's more luck of the draw and power than anything. They'll only go to war with someone they're superior over, which is just basic sense really isn't it.. And they're less/more likely to go to war based on their ethics and government aswell.\n\nDiplomacy does need some work as it's rather basic right now, reminds me a lot of Sins of a Solar Empire with how basic it is, but I expect expansions and future content to change this. It's a relatively simple affair of alliance, rivalry, star charts. Trading is simply energy credits or minerals in an instant transfer or monthly. It's lacking basically, but it's more than sufficient for the game at current. Alliance blocks can turn into federations, with one nation that leads them which switches out every 5-10 years to a different nation.\n\nResearch and tech. Boy, did they outdo themselves with this one. This deck-of-cards research system is simply amazing. I've found tech in some games I didn't know existed, only to never see it ever again in any other game. Basically it's split into three categories; physics, society and engineering. And within each category you'll get 3 techs to choose from, you pick one, research it, and when you go back to picking 3 again, it'll have shuffled and present all new options. Some are weighted to appear simply so you can advance in the game, such as colony ships, and spaceport upgrades, which makes sense otherwise you could get shafted hard. If your science ship surveys debris and finds certain tech then it will appear as a permanent tech option, below the normal three, that you can pick regardless of how many different techs you research.\n\nOverall, this is the game I've been waiting years for. It's exactly what I wanted in a Space 4X game, and it's growth into a GSG over time is well executed as it turns more to war/diplomacy. I want to note that this game isn't missing any features, it's just not fleshed out certain ones enough. Such as diplomacy, trade and managing factions. All of which are pretty basic right now, but that's to be expected when you think of the sheer scale this game has gone for. I'm all too happy to pay PDS money for DLC since I know that when they bring out expansion, it's actually an expansion for the game. I'm confident they'll continue to polish and add to this game for years and years to come just as they have for all their other titles/series: Victoria, Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis'\n\nSorry if I missed anything, the games just got so many features and so much content, I'm sure I did miss something but hell, there's almost too much to write about! xD","May 13","true","114.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Its beautiful, it has a great style, it is a grand strategy game buuut it is also a work in progress compared to the other Paradox games.\n\nI love it to bits but already after about 10hours I can see that we have a grand scale but not the same tools as in EU IV for instance.\n\nThere are no overlays for diplomatic considerations (ethos, ongoing wars, alliance/federation blocks, maybe border friction, "powerlevel" of fleets and tech, etc.).\n\nThere is no "ledger" I need to accumulate my information myself from different windows.\n\nI would LOVE to automate constructionships in the midgame... Please just let me priorize my build order, allocate resources, pool some constructionships and off they fly never to bother me again... even an CIV5 "automate worker" button would suffice. So many clicks and the only choice is what to build first...\n\nAll in all its GREAT  It has a great core gameplay, its clever game design is clearly visible. It will have a bright future but it has to grow first to compare to its great brothers and sisters, CKII, EUIV and likely also HOI4\n\nGoing to play in smaller universes for the time being to reduce the necessary micromanagement.","May 10","true","89.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
