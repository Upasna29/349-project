"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuirDragonne/recommended/49000/","MuirDragonne","Muir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuirDragonne/","1290 products in account","Hotel Dash is one of several games in the same genre as Diner Dash. The concept is simple: rush around taking care of everyones needs, upgrade the hotel, and earn star dollars to decorate the "honeymoon" suite. There are several hotels to fix up and run in the story mode.\n\nAs games go, this one is pretty simple to play. As long as you rack up combos, it isn't difficult to reach the score goal of each level. If you like casual time managment games, this game is probably right up your alley.","November 16, 2014","true","5.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

In some levels the 'stars' that block people walking past, well when they go back into their rooms the people are still stuck making me loose my level and having to restart until the glitch seems to not work thankfully and I can pass the level. Many other small issues, but I am having trouble to play now with major graphics issues and no settings in game to try and help.","April 26, 2015","false","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If they can fix that little bug then yeah totally buy this game. If you don't mind the random glitches then still get it. But for me this is bad and it scared me at first. I thought my computer was breaking and possesed. When I realized it was the game I got fustrated. If anyone can fix this or know how to fix it let others know. Thanks.\n\nLet me know because I love this series. It is fun. SO yeah.","June 7, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
