I could write several pages about why this game is enjoyable to play, but there are a million reviews that can give you that.  Instead, let me explain why all of the negative reveiwers are wrong:\n\n1 - Most of the negative reviewers can't read.  I don't know how to put this politely, but it seems that 9/10 of the negative reviews I see about this game come down to the fact that the reviewer didn't understand how a certain card or area worked.  For example, they'll say things like, "I couldn't use my Psionic Blast card in the middle of combat????"" ... when the card clearly states when you can use it.  I'm sorry, but if you can't even read, you shouldn't be reviewing games.\n\n2 - Many of the negative reviewers are 'hung up' on the game's randomness; in their minds, this means that the game does not "require any skill".  Several reviews talk about the random nature of the dice rolls and card draws--you even have YouTube personalities getting uptight over the randomness--and they all try to make the same, idiotic argument:  that the game isnt' as "good" as, say, Dota 2, or League of Legends (where skill is required).  Of course, what they are trying to say is that, in their estimation,  the game lacks strategic depth.  This is, of course, entirely false.  While the game may be easy to play (not requiring much skill), Talisman has layers upon layers of strategic depth, in that the entire game is built around choice-based risk management and knowledge of the game.\n\nYou see, these YouTubers who have NO FAMILIARITY WHATSOEVER with the game--and thus no strategic understanding of what they should be doing--and are just throwing dice and drawing cards, at random, and then simply pronouncing the game "dumb", "dull", or "without merit"--they're all just talking out of their asses.  They're like chimpanzees poking at a keyboard, as they make one bad decision after another.  And because the game isn't, say, League of Legends, they simply pass it off as crap.  Meanwhile, they raise up games like Hearthstone, etc.,  even though they are equally abstract and are driven by a similar kind of randomness.\n\n3 - Talisman is difficult for many reviewers to even classify, much less actually review well, and for a very specific reason.  On the surface, the game is "abstract", much in the same way that other boardgames, like Monopoly, are abstract.  The game board is an abstract "construct" that you move around by random dice rolls.  At the same time, you are playing a discreet character, in an almost RPG fashion, with spells, abilities, statistics, inventory, followers, etc.  These two aspects of the game, when combined, seem to confuse many reviewers who are simply incapable of appreciating the game as a whole.  They tend to focus on one of the game's aspects, while ignoring the other (or getting confused by it), and then lay all kinds of criticisms without looking at the whole game.  These are reviewers who simply cannot "pair" the RPG aspect with the abstract, boardgame aspect, so they simply trash the game without a second thought.  I'm sorry, but if you're too stupid to understand a game's overall design, you shouldn't be allowed to review it.\n\nDon't even get me started on the negative reviewers/monkeys who can't figure out the UI.  I mean ... really?  The game can be played on an iPad, but you can't figure out how to use the UI?  If nothing else, that tells you what kind of reviewer you're dealing with.\n\n4 - The base game has its flaws, but with DLC, Talisman: Digital Edition is a really great game.  Some reviewers complain about the game's standard ending--and, I would have to admit, the standard ending, in its own way, is rather lacking, and it can certainly take a while for the game to conclude.  There are options to make the game end faster, but of course the negative reviewers again fail to mention (or even see) this.\n\nMore than anything, though, it's worth noting that, the game's ample amount of DLC provides a metric ton of content, from 20+ new characters to play, additional game boards/regions, NPC's, hundreds of new cards, items, etc.--as well as dozens of new endings, both revealed and unrevealed.  And more are coming, as Nomad works to "finish" and/or round out the rest of the game, so that it matches the full boardgame (with all expansions) developed by Fantasy Flight Games.\n\nTo judge Talisman WITHOUT the DLC--which EVERYONE knew was coming--is just a huge disservice to the game.  I understand that reviewers are tasked with reviewing the base game on its own merit, but really anyone who is familiar with the board game will tell you that to review the base game alone is just a waste of a review.  With DLC, Talisman: Digital Edition is a great, very enjoyable, game, and any reviwer who "trashed" the base game--knowing that it was basically "unfinished", in a sense--is just ignorant, in my opinion.  They could at least mention the fact that DLC changes the base game completely.  Of course, none of these negative reviewers ever come back to re-review the game, with all of the DLC.  Like every good tabloid "writer", they're simply happy to skewer an easy target, and just move on.  It's shameful, really.\n\nAnyway ....If you are a boardgame fan and are thinking about getting Talisman, and are "on the fence" because of all of the negative reviews:  Don't worrry.  Don't listen to them.  Just get the game.  And get the DLC as well.  It's well worth it.  The negative reviews are largely written by people who can't read, who only played the base game, and are so used to playing FPS games, MOBA's, etc., that they don't even know what to make of Talisman.  Their reviews are crap.","November 1, 2015","true","116.2"," 253 of 302 people (84%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","84","253","302","41","6"

We are resilient, we are focused, we keep on playing the objective instead of mindlessly hoarding items for the rest of our days. But Talisman isn't meant to be played against the AI.\n\nIt's an incredibly fun game if you have at least two friends to play with. Please buy this game so I can pretend I have friends. It has huge replay value, a wide variety of characters and game modes, and even more if you buy the DLC, which isn't necessary, but I've done it anyways, because who gives a damn, it's my money, bro, don't tell me what to do.\n\nIt's a lot like Game of Thrones, not in the sense that you can have sex with your siblings, but more like you can furtively ruin the game for other players out of nowhere, like it's Wedding day.

I'd heard about the digital edition quite a while ago, when it first entered the Steam greenlight process (originally as Prologue, the single player edition). I've followed the progress up to the point where it was released though Steam Early Access and then jumped at the chance to get it.\n\nI've had a real blast playing both the Digital Edition (just against AI opponents at the moment) and playing the Prologue (single player variant game). My wife also expressed interest in playing it again (either Board version or Digital edition) so we gave local multiplayer a try using Steam Big Picture on her laptop, hooked up to our TV, and passing a mouse between us. It was a lot of fun\n\nIf you've ever played the boardgame, then I highly recommend the digital version. The game is faithful to the original in virtually every respect, with the addition of the Prologue single player edition which makes for a very enjoyable single player experience. There's no online multiplayer in the early access version yet, but it is coming in time for the full release of the game.\n\nIf you've never played the boardgame, but are interested in fantasy themed adventure boardgames, then track down the Demo of Talisman Prologue (http://www.talisman-game.com/prologuedemo/) and give it a try.","November 26, 2013","true","125.8"," 98 of 112 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","98","112","0","0"

I have played extensively on This Digital Deluxe version of Talisman now and can render the following Analysis:\n\nKeeping in mind that it IS still in Pre-release stage overall it is an enjoyable gaming experience one can play with the whole family (Up to 4 players).\n\nPros:\n\n1.) Simple to learn and play\n2.) Ease of use - the game is entirely mouse driven. One can play with the keyboard sitting on the desk, feet kicked up ... using only the mouse as you relax in your favorite chair.\n3.) In-game voice chat which can be muted by individual player\n4.) Fantasy based ... always a plus :)\n5.) Family Friendly - as long as you are not overly religious (Devils, demons, angels, undead etc are contained within)\n6.) A Mandatory Random setting!!! The host can set the game to Classic mode where no perks (Runes) can be used and all class choices are random, this is an option missing from other games (DoTP needs this badly)\n\nCons:\n1.) Glitches up terribly in Multi-player if someone leaves the game normally locking it up. (SP w/Bots works fine)\n2.) Game glitches if you alt/tab out to do something else\n3.) Re-playability isn't that good. It takes a couple of games to see all the spells and Adventure cards but once you have run through them once or twice, things tend to get repetative. They definitely need a wider range of spells and adventure cards.\n4.) Class balance isn't that good. Some classes are very noticeably more powerful than other classes and have abilities that give much greater advantages over other players (Prophetess and assassin come to mind)\n5.) Using AI's in Multi-player runs the risk of hanging the game up. Bots usually get hung up in the City at the alchemist and they go into an infinite loop and the game cannot progress from there but as of 1-7-2014 using all humans in MP games hasn't botched up unless someone rages quits .... which is common if the game is not going their way.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game as I expect all these problems to be worked out before its final release version.","January 7, 2014","true","108.3"," 72 of 82 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","72","82","0","2"

So, you'll find that the majority of negative reviews are from people who don't like Talisman.  Well duh.  That's not to say all negative reviews are irrellevant.  You just can't trust the meta score for a title like this and people playing a game they already know they'll hate makes for some pretty biased reviews.  The Steam ratings and reviews are generally more reasonable, though you do still see this happening.\n\nSo, are you new to Talisman?  New to board games in general?  No problem, simple way to see if you might enjoy it.  Youtube.  Go watch gameplay of the actual board game and/or the digital version.  If you find yourself wanting to take one of the seats and play - then this game is for you.  If it looks boring and you lose interest fast (as many people do with board games) then look elsewhere.  Lastly, I'm sure there are outliers.  People who like the board game but hate the digital version.  But, again - that should become obvious to you as you watch it played.\n\nI think Nomad has done an excellent job translating the game.  And as someone who has moved half-way across the world from their board game friends, it's a great way to keep in touch and get my fix.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/recommended/247000/","blue_award","Blue Award","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/","803 products in account","Digital edition of classic fantasy RPG board game, Talisman. If you know the board game and like it, think no more, you need this.\n\n..what if you don't know Talisman? I still recommend it!\n\nHeed this, though: old school board games tend to have different sensibilities than modern digital games and it may be bit too random for your taste. If you can't stomach being on top of the world only for your game to be turned into ashes in your mouth because of no fault of your own or genius of your opponents, but rather pure chance of bad dice rolls... This may not be for you.\n\nThat being said, people tend to look overly superficially and claim the game requires no skill. It's not true. Knowing what you're doing is half the battle. Yes the base rules are relatively straightforward, but there are many intricate synergies between your character and what's happening on the board, and seizing opportunities for such synergies is crucial to survival. More experienced or intelligent players *will* have enormous advantage over others.\n\nBut yeah, the other half of the battle is pure random rolls and there's always a small chance your next card will be something like a basilisk that rolls a double and you just simply die there and then, on the spot, game over. Or if someone makes grim reaper pay you a visit and you roll 1, pay fate to reroll, and still roll 1... Amygdala deeply rustled and cortisol city, you can get enraged and it is not pretty.\n\nAnyway...\n\nIt is quite a boon that there exist multiplayer scene for this game. Maybe not 24/7, but in reasonable European or American hours, it's not that hard to find a game. If you love the board game but have nobody to play with, digital version comes to the rescue and helps you to relive all those painful childhood memories ;)\n\nAnd all you need is base game; if any of the players who join your game have expansions, the host can turn them on, which is very nice. If your connection drops, AI plays for you until you rejoin but yes, you can rejoin, which is nice, too (though AI is only as smart as it has been programmed to be, if you know what I mean - live players can easily outsmart it but also make some stupid mistakes)\n\nThe bad things? Very occasionally the game crashes unrecoverably for some reason (even if you rejoin it will crash again), but I guess it's no better than rolling a double on a basilisk or double 1s on grim reaper so I wouldn't worry too much about it and there's always hope it will be fixed.\n\nIf you're a salty person, the game is generally not for you, as mentioned earlier.\n\nUI sometimes is not intuitive e.g. you can be quite puzzled when and how to cast a spell like Weaken or Freeze, or get confused and reroll a die when you actually wanted to pick one of the two outcomes in some situations.. only experience can help you here and hopefully fellow players if you ask nicely\n\n\nSee you on the Crown of Command, adventurer","April 10, 2015","true","157.2"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","48","54","2","2"

My partner and I enjoy playing and we laugh hard at the antics which play out over the board, but there are still way too many things not working as intended, too many bugs, too many instances where the user interface doesn't do what you may want it to do.\n\nThey're charging a lot of money for content that isn't even created yet, and the stuff that is already there often does not work as advertised. I've had a lot of fun with this game, but as yet it still acts way too much like a beta version for Nomad to be charging full price.\n\nI can recommend this game only to hardcore fans of the genre like myself.

The appeal of this game as a digital copy of the board game is twofold:  The computer manages all the fidely cards and components (plus no clean up or set up), and this digital edition is WAY cheaper than than the physical game.  Playing games with AI can be great too if you have no friends.\n\nIf you have no idea what Talisman is but are intrested in this game, let me lay it out for you:  Talisman is a RPG in a box.  You pick one of a million characters with unique abilites and attributes and race against other characters to reach the 'crown of command', a game space that slowly kills all the other players.  If you kill everyone else, you win.  The thing about the crown is that its locked away in an inhosptable wasteland that your weak character will not be able to reach right away.  As a result, you gotta level up, fighting monsters, encountering events, and PVPing other players.  Awesome stuff.\n\nThis game is not without its faults though.  This game is extremely RNG based.  Everything is based on dice rolls.  There is strategy in the game, sure, but alot of the time so many random things you can't control are happpening that you kind of have to just roll with it.  This is essentially the heart and soul of the game, so if this is unappealing to you, this game might not be for you.  Now personally, normally I hate games that are overly based on luck, but Talisman is great because it never pigeon holes you into situations.  Every turn you have a choice on which direction to go, where on the board(s) to travel, who to interact with, etc and these choices give you an illusion of freedom and often a way to blame yourself for your bad luck.  Went into a cave and got ♥♥♥♥ed by a dragon at level one?  Should have gone to town, your opponent would have got the dragon instead.  Now, this game does have a 'fate' system that lets you reroll dice, giving you some control over your luck, but it can be hard sometimes to know when is best to reroll and sometimes you can just reroll bad rolls again(dice rolls are seeded at the begining of the game, so reloading doesnt work).\n\nThis game does a great job of always giving you something to do and work towards, and the various expansions give lots of variety and alternative scenarios.  If you get this game I highly recommend some of the expansions (get the season pass on sale to get all future expansions cheap), specifically the reaper and the corner boards.\n\nBefore rounding out this review I just want to provide a shout out to the company that made this digital adaption, nomad games.  Originally I thought this company was just porting this game from the ios and wouldn't care for the quality of the game post release.  How wrong I was.  Not only do they participate on the forums frequently and respond to posters, but they have even developed and distributed free content based on customer critisism.  This is very rare these days and exremely praiseworthy.\n\nObjectively Talisman isn't the greatest game ever made, but I seriously love this game regardless.  It may be luck heavy but the experience of travelling around the board, collecting loot and getting stronger before racing to the end against other players is great.  Laugh at your friends as the dice ♥♥♥♥ them, then cry out in amazement as they get the luckiest card draws, but most of all enjoy the ride and the emerging narrative that the game provides.","April 17","true","30.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I would happily recommend this to anyone, regardless of whether one was a fan of the original tabletop Talisman.\n\nTalisman: Digital Edition has HUGE replay value, owing to the random nature and variety of card draws, and the large assortment of character classes available. Each class allows (and often requires) you to approach the game in a different way. You can also customize various game rules before starting up a new game, which adds to the variety and replayability.\n\nThe DLC is also strongly recommended.

Well iam sure that i have to point out that  9/10 of all my latest games shows bugs (some game breaking some minors ones).\n*MP (public games) is most of the time a place for leavers and quitters.\n*The ai is improved compared with the one years ago, but still not worth to buy this game for a single player. You only can cheat the game (you add runestones to the ai and give them a big advantage)\n*They changed there Season Pass conduct, and released one DLC (The Shaman) without giving it for free to the former buyers.\n* A constant dropping number of people playing online on Steam\n\nFinally i have to note that ca 400 of my hours where used for beta gaming,  and as a long time supported and as a former member of most of the groups and even the founder of the german group.

While it's vaguely interesting, it's massively dominated by luck rather than strategy, and plays at a snail's pace once you know what's going on.\n\nThe default Crown of Command victory mechanic harshly punishes any player trying to win, effectively removing them from the game and having them roll a die every turn to see if they get closer to winning. During this time, other players can interrupt the lead player or heal themselves, build up their strength, reset the lead player's advantage, and then walk in and win an hour later. Luckily there are houserules that deal with this (instantly winning or disabling healing when someone reaches the Crown).\n\nThey try to keep it interesting with the runes, which you earn by playing a lot. All the runes do is give you a minor, but unfair, advantage. Additionally, custom classes and cards which were easy to incorporate in physical editions are sold in relatively expensive DLC packs, leaving the core game feeling sparse.\n\nIt could be fun as a lighthearted game with friends every once in a while.","April 4, 2015","false","11.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

My Elf soon discovers that he has a nack for lifting, so he begins to Lift all across the land. He soon becomes the strongest Elf, to the point that Dragons immediately burn up and die by simply being in his presence. The Elf soon becomes known as Bicelf, master the bicep and all things body building. The Elf then notices that a stream of protein powder has appeared in a forest, aswell as a stream of life in a another forest. Enraptured by its beauty he rushes to the stream with great passion ,and proceeds to travel back and fourth between the streams, mixing them into the ultimate protein shake, and in the end drinking the all the streams had to offer. However, while the Elf was busy mixing his poretin shake, a Dwarf who came from a noble line, decends into a pit of dispair in the tavern as he drinks his life away. He soon contracts every STD in existance, and came across a ball, of which whispers to him of darkness. However, because of the sheer number of STD's he has become a STD himself and begins to poison the entire land, slowly draining the life from anything he touches as nothing can fix him, and when I say nothing I mean nothing no healer, no magican not even a angel could heal him. My Elf hearing of this taint on the land travels to meet it, but the STD riddled Dwarf eludes him at every turn. Unable to catch the Dwarf, the Dwarf proceeds to devour all who live. The Dwraf of whom chases after a ninja who, has lost all honor and decended into killing innocent animals in the forest. Even trying to turn his sword into gold, but failing and leaving himself with a half sword half clump of gold that no one will buy. My Elf continues to destroy dragons by simply looking at them, but cannot catch the Dwarf. Seeing no other option my Elf turns to the crown of power, deciding the only option is to purge the world of life, of which will include the STD riddled Dwarf or as the towns call him, the destoryer of worlds. My Elf begins his journey entering the center world, melting the sentinal with a simple flex of his pecks. Now, with his 2 mules, Unicorn, ring of power, crown of soloman, battle axe, Mecernary, Alchemist, Water canister, chestpiece and most importantly the Talisman, he begins his journey into the wasteland. Back in the outside world, the Dwarfs power grows, and he finally reaches and mugs the ninja. Stealing his chestpiece for himself, and trading his kills in for strength, and slowly growing in power. After a short journey my Elf reaches the doors to the desert and begins his journey, in its harsh and unforgiving environment. As he travels through he soon meets death himself, death of whom claims to be stronger than the Elf. Hearing this, my Elf declares that nothing is stronger and begins to fight death. The battle lasts for days, but eventually my Elf gains the upper hand, body slamming death into the ground, and crushing him between his biceps. Having beaten Death to death, our hero proceeds to the crown. But, along the journey he is confronted by a pack of wolves, which he incinerates, by simple showing his perfect and well toned pecks. Now, at the last leg of his journey, he stands before the crown taking a moment to savor the moment he purges the destroyer of worlds. After, savoring the moment he then grasps the crown, placing it atop his head, and the purge begins. The Dwarf however, who has grown much stronger, feels the purge as it begins to take affect and makes a dash to stop the Elf. However, as he comes upon the sentinal he is torn apart by the sentinal. The ninja having seen this, runs out and uses a magic spell he learnt to destroy all the items the Dwarf held. As the items are thrown into the infinite void, a faint whisper could be heard by the ninja, telling him of the power of the ball the Dwarf possessed. But, the ninja's mind though devoid of all honor still retains its strength, and the ball is left to the void. The Dwarf unable to reconsitute himself, due to the purge begins to slip into the void, pulling all his cancerous STD riddled flesh with it. The Elf whom still wears the crown, finishes the purge, destroying the ninja and all life on earth, and sealing off the void so that nothing, not even the Dwarf could return. The Elf however, being the only thing alive on the planet, uses his powerful muscles to create life and begins to repopulate the world. Writing down the events tha thave transpired, so that the future generations of this world could read of their history. However, the Elf could not stay for long as his muscles soon became so perfect that he can no longer reside with the likes of mortals, at the risk of incinerating them from its sheer perfection. Ascending to the relm of the gods instead, where he could become the god of lifting.\n\nGood game 10/10, would purge the world of life to stop a insideous STD riddled Dwarf again.","July 3, 2015","true","36.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","6","8","8","2"

Having played dice with Death, and won, I was quickly on my way to true dominance. The Crown, so near my grasp... was snatched away in an instant. The troll who had tried so long to surpass me, always failing, clearly made devilish deals with that prancing imbecile of a wizard. I was blindsided by a curse and I had to choose between the total loss of my considerable physical strength, or another roll of the dice. I rolled, and I was made a toad. For three long rounds. I could no longer carry my dazzling array of mystical arms and armor or my enchanted trinkets. My followers abandoned me, thinking likely I was simply a toad now and would remain that way. I was forced to enter the Werewolf Den, and there I was brutally beaten back to Death's Door. Then I was shoved back to the Crypts where, weak and confused, I was banished from the inner-realm back to that hell-hole of a city. Gathering myself, freed from the toady curse which had ailed me, I prepared to ascend the ladder of chaos and ambition once more. The damage however had been done; despite defeating the Sentinel in my weakened state and  battling my way back into the inner-realms, I was ultimately undone by the coniving treacheries of that damnable troll.

You fight monsters and gain stats along the way(Just like Monopoly, THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO BUY THE PROPERTY- a.k.a fight the monster). This was one of the worst boardgames I've played, as it is linear, without any tactical sense or strategy required, and being 95% luck based clearly does not help.\n\nThis is coming from a huge boardgame fan - having played quite a huge number of them (Descent, Arkham Horror, War of the Ring, Cosmic Encounter- to name a few).\n\nMy Gameplay Session - Played a warrior, not knowing the rules, rolls some dice. Rolls more dice, arrives at the center early because it seems to be the goal- doesn't have to spend a brainwave to think. Realized that I can't get to the middle without an item, attacked an AI and got the Talisman. Arrived middle, then a 30 minute snooze-fest of rolling dice while the enemies heal up and die so very very slowly.\n\nI'm not saying that a good game needs to have some degree of complexity. I've enjoyed simple games like Ticket to Ride or Cleopatra, that at least its not a boring snooze fest. There is no immersion, I don't feel like a warrior, its just a label and gimmick, at the end of the days, Classes are just player modification that does very little to differentiate you from one another- you don't have to be smart about it, you just need to have half a brain and huge amounts of luck to do well in this game.\n\nI don't understand why this game has the "Strategy" or the "RPG" tag with it. It should instead be replaced with the "Casual" Tag. This game reminds me with many of the App games and certainly does not belong in these categories.\n\n3/10\n\n","July 22, 2014","false","6.4"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","1"

I have played a lot of Talisman and it already isn't a game I'm very fond of. Almost the entire game is luck. What you roll to move, what cards you draw, whether you complete combat, it's all a coin flip. The main test of skill is knowing when you've acquired enough random loot to try the inner layers of the board. It's a very light game mechanically. It's rare that other players' turns have effects on you, so there's a lot of downtime. It's a social game.\n\nThe port is kind of a mess. Not only is the interface generally clunky requiring what feel like unnecessary taps to get to the information you want, but it's ported from the mobile version and clearly optimized for a touch screen, not a computer. For example, all of the controls are on the left and right edges of the screen where your thumbs would be on a tablet. It's a clunky version of an okay, very random board game.","December 24, 2014","false","1.3"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","21","39","0","1"

If not, read on.\n\nIf you do buy this game or have received it for free, then by all means enjoy it with the friend/enemy who gave it to you and never ever play with the AI. This game mimics the classic board game well but it\'s a vastly different experience when you play with a physical board, miniatures and a jolly group of friends in front of you. With the digital game, it just feels hollow without the expressions and emotions involved when a plan comes together or falls apart.\n\nThe game itself is quite easy to pick up but expect to spend at least 2 hours per playthrough depending on how many players in a match. There\'s a lot of downtime as to be expected with most board games while waiting for your turn to roll around and the mechanics are pretty rudimentary and very RNG dependent. Imagine your delight as you reach the very anticlimatic finale which is the Crown of Command. While there, expect to spend the remainder of your turns and probably 45 mins of your life just constantly failing a 50-50 chance a zillion times just to ATTEMPT to end the game while other players counterspell you, heal back up or just try to reach you.\n\nAside from destroying my mouse on multiple clicks to try to speed things up in frustration, the worst came when another player finally reached the Crown too then promptly died and left all his junk on the same tile which prompts an encounter at the start of each turn asking if you\'d like to pick up their stuff even when your own inventory is full thus adding more time to the excruciating endeavour.\n\nIf you must play the game, then I whole heartedly suggest playing the physical tabletop version with some good friends instead of the digital one.","June 1","false","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's annoying having to wait until your turn to be able to do this. It becomes worse when there are adventure cards on the tile and you can't see what they do to plan ahead. It makes turns slower, which is unfortunately a bad thing in a game that already takes hours to finish.\nThe second: Allow saving of games in multiplayer mode. Not being able to continue a game from where you left off is a huge minus when compared to the Tabletop Simulator version, especially considering how long these games can last.\nThe third: maybe lower the price of the expansions/season pass a bit. I know it's cheaper if you buy it from the official site, instead of on Steam, but most probably won't check there.\nThe fourth: Reduce the overall clunkiness/unfriendliness of the UI. Having to click a portrait to reveal the silhouette with a ?, then right click that, followed by another click on the portait in this context menu just to read a player's character sheet is annoying. The unbought DLC being similarly displayed as the purchased DLC isn't a huge deal, but it could certainly benefit from being made clearer. The same applies to spell casting. Making it more obvious that a spell is queued, or that double clicking the spell casts it without confirming it, would all go to improving the UI.\n\nStill a good game though. Pretty cheap if you only go for one or two expansions and the base game. Around £5 for the base game and an expansion or two is amazing value.","October 30, 2015","true","40.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This digital version has sold me on the physical version which is superior in all ways but one.

So if you want to play a bit of Talisman but don't have the ability to get a physical game going this digital version should be good enough.\n\nNote: The developer did a UI overhaul with the recent City expansion.

Let me explain why, the game itself is fun and good. It is more monopoly and chance related than your choices but it is fun to play with four people. It is the board game, so if you enjoyed the board game it you'll enjoy this. Only buy it on sale though, because... the board game is around $40 and you can just split that four ways with friends if you want.\nNow to the negative.\nMy problem is the game needs to be fixed. The spell casting is wonky, two DIFFERENT people with me accidently casted Immobilize on themselves because there is no Confirmation in some instances. When you play you'll get it, it is quite difficult to explain. There is also no Cancel button to take back and attacks or spells you use. This to me, is part of the fun with the game to scare/intimidate your opponent. Also, sometimes people misclick!\n\nAlright so I'll try to explain the spell casting. I have a spell called Psychic blast and it adds my craft to my strength for the fight. Except you for some reason can't activate it during combat? Unless it was qued up before? When it's qued any thing that triggers a fight will cast it, and sometimes you don't remember that it was qued and it goes off on something you didn't want.

Кидай собі кубик, совай фішки і гати бізнес/опонентів. Тема більш серйозних настолок в пост радянському просторі розкрита слабо.\nПо-перше, це дуже специфічна забава: деякі настольні ігри (особливо за редакцією правил D&D) настільки складні, що для розуміння найбанальніших аспектів потрібно витратити чимало часу на ознайомлення з правилами.\nПо-друге, коло фанів та гравців хоч і розширюється, проте недостатньо швидко: знайти компанію для гри в реалі доволі тяжко. Проте розробники Talisman - комп'ютерного аналогу одноіменної фентезійної настольної гри від Games Workshop взяли курс на широкі маси.\n\nТа незручна мить, коли параметр "Удача" прокачаний на 1Суть гри на перший погляд виглядає доволі тривіально: ось тобі карта, ось тобі персонаж. Мета: "всіх гепну і буду царювати". Тут варто зробити уточнення, що сценаріїв є достобіса, але всі вони доступні лише в додатковому контенті... Проте відривати кревно зароблені гроші не обов'язково: стандартна карта доволі реіграбельна - велика кількість унікальних персонажів, що доступні зі старту, дозволить розбавити ігровий процес.\nРухаємось ми по карті кидаючи ігрові кості ("дайси"). Якщо результат нам не дуже підходить, використавши один бал долі можна перекинути дайс. Також ця особливість стосується і певних локацій на карті (відьма, чаклун, цвинтар тощо). Особливо недитячий накал пристрастей і бурління емоцій викликають моменти, коли, в надії перекинути на що-небудь, окрім того що було, гравець отримує те саме значення на дайсі. 99% ragequit'ів і пригорілих штанів припадають на ситуації, коли вдруге випадає єдина нейприйнятна подія з шести можливих.\nПересунувшись на певне поле, ми тягнемо карту з колоди подій. Події можуть бути різними: від дракона до того самого Талісману, який дозволить нам пройти до фінального рівня карти і, подолавши усі перешкоди, почати робити масовий абзац менш везучим опонентам.\nВ процесі екстермінатусу ворогів нам допомогатимуть шмотки, супутники і навіть нейтрали (заваливши певну кількість істот можна прокачати магічну або фізичну силу персонажу). Проте, хоча багато чого і залежить від удачі і випадковості, не варто сліпо на неї покладатись, адже карти з закляттями і купа різного спорядження існує не просто так. Мудрі рішення - запорука перемоги.\n\nДля тих, хто любить очима Графомани можуть йти лісом, дивитись тут немає на що. Все гарно промальовано, але не більше. 2D інтерфейс доволі зрозумілий: якщо на карті стоять хрести, то це кладовище, якщо стоїть храм... Ну, ви зрозуміли.\n\nЛожка дьогтю в банці медуПохила навчання доволі крута. Перші 2-3 гри ви будете вигрібати механіку і задавати питання "Що я? Хто я? Чому я?!".\nДругий біль - відсутність локалізації: якщо ваша англійська складається лише із "My name is Vova" - бути біді. Тексту багато, читати його треба, інакше вашому протеже настане каюк.\nІнший мінус - наявність у онлайн іграх тролів або людей, які через тільки Богу відомі причини стають AFK: чекання по півтори хвилини на хід гравця (яких може бути до 4х) вибішує жвавіше, аніж виступи наших депутатів. Трохи покращує ситуацію автозаміна хронічних слоупоків ботами і можливість продовжити гру пізніше.\n\n- Зараз буде шістка!\n- Ага, кидай вже.\n- Нуууууууууу....!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/diesel8590/recommended/247000/","diesel8590","thatdiesel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/diesel8590/","434 products in account","A Tough Talisman to Sell\nAs AAA games come out left and right, there are times when a simple board game with friends can bring just as much enjoyment as any multi-million dollar project.  Talisman: Digital Edition brings to the plate the concept of sitting down with three friends and experiencing the thrill of telling a character’s story through each roll of the die.  Though Talisman does bring a lot to the plate in terms of accessibility and content, frustrating mechanics and game-breaking bugs riddle what could be an above-average title.\n\nTalisman pits a chosen character against three players, human or A.I., in a quest to retrieve the Crown of Command.  To do so, one must obtain the coveted Talisman to cross the Valley of Fire.  Getting to the Valley of Fire is no simple feat, as one has to train their characters to withstand the demons, monsters, spirits, and other characters out to end their journey.  Each character comes with five stats: Strength, Craft, Lives, Fate, and Gold.  Strength determines how much damage you can do against strength monsters.  Craft shows how much damage you can deal to craft-based monsters, as well as your stat to how many magic spells you can hold.  Lives are your total life counter, when you hit zero, you drop all your items and go back to base stats.  Fate is your re-roll counter, use a Fate counter to re-roll for a better number.  Gold allows you to buy certain items from vendors, as well as bargain with certain monsters.\n\nThe goal in Talisman is to beef up a character, retrieve a Talisman through either completing a quest or through prayer, and reaching the Crown of Command.  Doing so is no easy or short task, with most games taking easily over an hour to complete, depending on dice rolls and which cards appear.  Though the allotted time spent on one game may put off players, getting three friends in the mix most certainly makes the time much more enjoyable.  The accomplishment of getting a character to ludicrous levels and auto-killing dragons makes the long journey well worth it, especially when a character can auto-kill a friend’s character; the fear one can put onto people is wicked fun.\n\nBut where Talisman shines with its cooperative play, there are many design decisions that can frequently darken the experience, mainly how luck-based Talisman proves to be.  Almost every move one does in Talisman is based off the luck of the die: movement, combat, everything on the path to victory relies on something completely out of control.  Items and objects can help the strain of progressing through the map, but there are spots on the board where one unfortunate roll can wipe away almost an hour’s worth of progress.  It’s almost as if Talisman does not want the player to win, opting more to continue progressing characters to no discernable end, something a game should never do.\n\nThe most disappointing factor in Talisman is its abundance of game-breaking bugs and issues that plague aspects of the game.  Through the 11 hours I played, at least once every two games would freeze or lock into a game-breaking screen.  Whether it was being stuck in an item screen, the “roll dice” button refusing to work, or being stuck perpetually casting a spell, it’s a hard pill to swallow letting a game go one to two hours only to have to exit the game with no accomplishment or satisfaction for the time spent.\n\nTalisman also has one unbelievably laughable issue with its Warlock Quests; Warlock Quests are specific quests, like visiting an NPC on the board, or acquiring armor, that fulfilling the quest will grant you a Talisman and get you on the path to victory.  If a player happens to acquire a Talisman and not finish their Warlock Quest, the path to get to the final section of the board will be blocked off until the quest is complete, regardless of if the character already has the prize at hand.  What’s even more baffling is there’s no way to remove a Warlock Quest unless the character dies completely, this is almost game breaking when a Warlock Quest like “Slay a Dragon” is in possession, leaving one to hope that they can find one to two specific cards in a 100+ card deck amongst three other players.  Situations like this become more common than they should be, and it’s a really sad ordeal to see a game come to an abrupt end after one can get so enveloped into their game.\n\nTalisman has every right to be a popular, fun, and engaging game to experience with friends and players online.  Each character plays a different role and each game plays out different than the last.  It’s just a shame to see such a bright experience be crippled by frequent crashes, freezes, bugs, and some laughable design choices that do nothing but encumber the experience.  As much as I want to recommend Talisman, I just can’t in the state it’s in and with the decisions it’s made.","December 31, 2014","false","10.5"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","2"

Timing of spells is the biggest one offhand.  You often need to play a spell at the start of the affected character's turn but, at least when playing against the computer there is often no delay between after one character has moved (signifying the end of the start of it's turn) and the turn ending meaning.  The queue system is very clunky and it is very easy to cast a spell/use an item too early, too late, or even at the completely wrong time due to it being playable at the wrong place in combat.\n\nAlso you cannot look at the board outside of your turn causing you to waste time doing it on your own turn if you missed something.  In singleplayer you can look at the board outside of your turn but it pauses the game.  There is no sort of event log or even way to view the discard piles (that I am aware of) so often things will flip by and you'll have no idea what transpired and no way to look.  As mentioned in the comments there is an event log and it seems to have some good options for filtering.\n\nIn multiplayer there are often problems where one or more person will be disconnected and you get to rewatch the computer play the same turn(s) over.  This seems to happen more often later in the game and w/ the city expansion but that's just my experience from 2-3 games.  Frequent crashes and glitches can cause players to miss the end of game meaning they get no in game credit or achievements for anything they would have earned there for potentially several hours of effort.\n\nThere was a recent patch addressing many outstanding issues with the game.  End of game crashes most notably were addressed and I haven't seen that happen in the few games I've played since.  I haven't seen any midgame crashes either, but I have not tried playing with the city expansion again.\n\nOne upside is the Season Pass actually comes with all the dlc with the exception of one which contributes to charity.\n\nIf most of these problems were addressed I would absolutely recommend this game especially to fans of the physical game.","January 13","false","25.8"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","19","36","0","2"

In the weeks since then patches have been released that have hugely improved the stability of the game and fixed most of the frustrations I had with the game.

The Reaper expansion is highly recommended as it adds a lot of new flavor, cards, and player characters to the game.

I've been an owner of multiple versions of Talisman over the years and was very exicted to see this being worked on. While it has some bugs and annoyances, overall I think it's a great start. I'll go over some of the issues first.\n\n1) Random crashes. Yeah , they happen. Hopefully they clear up before it goes live as this completely ruins a live game.\n2) Bad network connectivity. People randomly just disconnect. Whats worse, is there is no way to re-join a game (that I am aware of) to continue. AI takes over.\n3) Spell casting is not intuitive. I played for over a month until i realized I can queue up a spell to automatically cast on the next players start of turn. Casting counter spell at the right time seems rough. The general responsiveness of double clicking spells is bad. Sometimes you have to click 20 times for it to actually work.\n4) No way to stop zooming into the board. This might be good for most people are a new to the game, but veterans dont need to read the board every time and would rather keep an overall look of the board. They need to make this an option.\n\nOther than these three issues, the game is great. The rules are handled very well, I have only found one or two issues I have had to report on rules. The animations dont overbear the game. The speed of turns is just right, with included features like auto-kill when there is no need to roll opposing dice.\n\nOne feature i'd like to see is allowing AI to play your turn for you while you take a bathroom break :)","February 11, 2014","true","59.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I purchased the season pass for this in order to get all of the expansions as they become available. While I certainly get a bit itchy to see the next one come up immediately, it is not because of undue slowness of release so much as my enthusiasm. That being said, do not expect to pick this thing up and have all content immediately, or even in the next couple of months. I feel that the quality of the experience definitely is worth the wait, but if you are an "instant gratification only" sort of gamer, then I would advise waiting a little bit. I say this because the value of the season pass is incredible. Since this is a bit of a financial leap, I downloaded the demo of the Prologue, liked what I saw, and went for it. A comparison of the cost between the tabletop version of the game + expansions will send you reeling, and to me was a great option as a way to eventually test the expansions out before investing in the physical boards, since I don't play often enough to justify buying all of them.\nTotally worth it, in my opinion!!!\n\nThe Game:\nThe game varies in small ways from the Prologue, as it has been updated and refined, and I consider these differences to be in the best interest of the game for playability and ease of use. Keep in mind that the prologue is designed as a single player experience, and the interface is adjusted accordingly.\nUnfortunately, I have not been online with the game and can therefore not comment on that.\nThe House Rules and various play options are fantastic.\nThe DLC: In between releases of expansions, features are updated and new characters are added to the mix. These have interesting abilities and seem balanced, though I am still playing through to try different play styles, since some characters are meant to flourish when played in a particular way.\nI was really pleased with the way that the Reaper expansion was handled. There are some great adventure cards and characters, but the Reaper himself is not my favorite game element. When the community spoke, the developers listened and added the ability to deactivate the Reaper while keeping the rest of the expansion in play.\nFrostmarch has just been released, so I look forward to checking that out as well.\nI expect that some members of the community may say that this content "should" be released faster, I really think that the quality is well worth the wait, and that the characters that are added in between expansions keep the worst of the suspense at bay.\n\n","June 24, 2014","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But not without qualification.  While an ably faithful translation of the boardgame experience, the AI is simply not challenging enough for veteran players of the game.  It's not that the AI will never win against a seasoned player.  It can.  But things have to go extremely right for the AI, and extremely wrong for the player, for this to happen.   Even with the wonky AI, I still find myself enjying the game.  And I believe most folks familiar with the game will, as well.\n\nIf you've never played Talisman, the AI is actually a benefit, as it keeps the game from being too punishing to neophyte players.  It's not that Talisman is an overly complex game.  But there is a lot of information to absorb.  The starter set alone boasts over a dozen playable characters, all of whom have multiple special abilities and differing alignments; there are five attributes for each character; there are nearly one hundred event cards, spells, etc.  So you get the idea.  There's a bit to learn and the AI allows games to extend the learning curve.\n\nIf reviews were given on a scoring basis as opposed to a simple recommend/not recommend, I would score Talisman: Digital Edition a solid 8.  In spite of the AI, the overall gameplay experience is fun for those who like board games or fantasy settings and there is a lot of replayability to be had.\n\n","May 8, 2014","true","273.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A few of the specific character AI's such as a the elf sometimes still do strange stuff, but overall the AI is at least competant enough for a single player vs AI game to be satisfying to me.\n\nIf you have not played the board game and are on the fence, but you do like board games that involve a bit of luck, then I still recomend giving it a try, but probably best to not pay full price if you are on the fence. (I paid full when it came out and still consider it worth it, but this is a game with a lot of childhood nostalgia for me, so I'm highly biased)\n\nIf you do get it, getting at least one of the expansions (Reader or Frostmarch) is highly recomended, because they basically double the size of the adventure deck and give you a few more characters to play with which adds a lot to the replayability.","June 30, 2014","true","231.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This definately isn't a coffee break game, be prepared to sit down, and roll lots of virtual dice. I have to admit I never had a chance to play the original board game - but if you had friends to play this with you, I could definately understand why you would sink Hundreds of dollars into this game. I guess I should be happy getting this for under $6.\n\nSince this is a video-game however, you still have something to get out of playing A.I. opponents. My first match took just over 2 hours, getting to know the game, and complaining to my computer enemies. All the random elements definately add a lot of spice to the flow of gameplay.

The main goal of the game is to build up your character by travelling around the board, gaining Strength and Craft by events, killing monsters, and sometimes, luck. There are three "sections" of the realm, and once you get to the inner most area with a Talisman, you attempt to kill the other players off by casting the "command spell", which has a 50% chance of all players losing one life. This is the only way to win the game, as killing the players before someone is at the center just results in that player gaining a new character.\n\nI recommend getting the Gold Pack, as the expansions make the game that much more fun to play, and the benefit of more character choices makes the strategy more varied.","June 30, 2014","true","55.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's obviously not the same as sitting with your dudes around a table and fooling around and looking and touching analogue things, but the digital version is way less time consuming and way cheaper of course, since the boardversion basegame is already 3 times more expensive than the digital version and the season pass is going to bring you all the expansions for actually a little price compared to the summed up costs of all the board-expansions. Not too bad, isn't it? And yes, you can play over the Internet with your friends, if they got the baseversion of the digital edition. If one player got the DLC expansions (or the season pass) and is hosting a game, all the other players are able to play with the expansions. So, you only need to buy the DLCs additionally to the host, if you are going to play Singleplayer or wanna play with the new characters provided by the DLCs.\n\nThe downside of the game for me is, they could've made the digital version more attractive by adding some detail animations to the board and character figures with sound effects and maybe more music. At the moment it's really just a boardgame made digital with little advancement (sounds, music and handling maybe, since the boardgame can be very complex if you play it with its expansions), however this still keeps being a very good port of a boardgame classic. ;-)","September 12, 2014","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the weeks since then patches have been released that have hugely improved the stability of the game and fixed most of the frustrations I had with the game. I have played the game dozens of times in the last several weeks and have not had any crashes or major bugs.\n\nI only play Talisman single-player, so I can't speak for MP (I own the actual board game if I want to play with friends). This game does a fine job of replicating the actual board game at a much lower price. If you enjoy classic board games with a high degree of randomness and luck, as well as strategy, Talisman DE. The Reaper expansion is highly recommended as it adds a lot of new flavor, cards, and player characters to the game. The runes are great in helping you customize your game play style and overcome some of the weaknesses of the different characters.\n\nIf you love board games with a large variety of options and a different experience each time you play, get this game!","March 4, 2014","true","323.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But not without qualification.  While an ably faithful translation of the boardgame experience, the AI is simply not challenging enough for veteran players of the game.  It's not that the AI will never win against a seasoned player.  It can.  But things have to go extremely right for the AI, and extremely wrong for the player, for this to happen.   Even with the wonky AI, I still find myself enjying the game.  And I believe most folks familiar with the game will, as well.\n\nIf you've never played Talisman, the AI is actually a benefit, as it keeps the game from being too punishing to neophyte players.  It's not that Talisman is an overly complex game.  But there is a lot of information to absorb.  The starter set alone boasts over a dozen playable characters, all of whom have multiple special abilities and differing alignments; there are five attributes for each character; there are nearly one hundred event cards, spells, etc.  So you get the idea.  There's a bit to learn and the AI allows games to extend the learning curve.\n\nIf reviews were given on a scoring basis as opposed to a simple recommend/not recommend, I would score Talisman: Digital Edition a solid 8.  In spite of the AI, the overall gameplay experience is fun for those who like board games or fantasy settings and there is a lot of replayability to be had.\n\n","May 8, 2014","true","273.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been an owner of multiple versions of Talisman over the years and was very exicted to see this being worked on. While it has some bugs and annoyances, overall I think it's a great start. I'll go over some of the issues first.\n\n1) Random crashes. Yeah , they happen. Hopefully they clear up before it goes live as this completely ruins a live game.\n2) Bad network connectivity. People randomly just disconnect. Whats worse, is there is no way to re-join a game (that I am aware of) to continue. AI takes over.\n3) Spell casting is not intuitive. I played for over a month until i realized I can queue up a spell to automatically cast on the next players start of turn. Casting counter spell at the right time seems rough. The general responsiveness of double clicking spells is bad. Sometimes you have to click 20 times for it to actually work.\n4) No way to stop zooming into the board. This might be good for most people are a new to the game, but veterans dont need to read the board every time and would rather keep an overall look of the board. They need to make this an option.\n\nOther than these three issues, the game is great. The rules are handled very well, I have only found one or two issues I have had to report on rules. The animations dont overbear the game. The speed of turns is just right, with included features like auto-kill when there is no need to roll opposing dice.\n\nOne feature i'd like to see is allowing AI to play your turn for you while you take a bathroom break :)","February 11, 2014","true","59.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I thought a few bucks on a Steam game versus a much larger amount thrown at a random eBayer was wise, but unfortunately the game falls short.\n\nIt's buggy, especially in online play.  Two games were all it took to decide this is best played as a local match.  Freezes, CTDs, and the inability to drop in on an existing game really killed the experience.\n\nPlaying against CPUs is no fun, either.  The rolls always seem to go in their favor.  Don't believe me?  I finally had a good match and got to the Crown of Command, but it took over twenty turns to win because I rolled a 3 or lower about 75% of the time.  A game I would have won swiftly in real life turned into a Sorceress almost making her way to the Valley of Fire all the way from the Outer Region.\n\nIf you're nostalgic for the game and don't mind the extra cash, you'll be a lot happier with the game in hand.

As I said, the idea is great, so I'm saddened by the glaring flaws.\nFirst, and probably most importantly, this game is very nearly entirely luck.  Yes, you get to make 2 choices about where you land each turn.  2 choices.  If you use spells, you can decide who to cast them on.  But you don't get to decide what spells you have, or when you get them.  This game would be a bazillion times more fun if they added a speed stat that let you move any number of spaces less than or equal to your speed, instead of rolling the die.  One of my favorite cards is a follower that "curses" you by making you only move 1 space each turn.  It gives me a unique sense of control in the game that I consider a major advantage.\nSecondly, there are a lot of ways to (randomly and unexpectedly) lose that don't make any sense.  For example, if you ever, ever get turned into a toad, you've basically lost.  "But you haven't lost, yet."  Sure, sure, I can continue playing for the hour or so the game might continue in hopes of some shocking recovery... but honestly, why make a player randomly turn into a toad?  To my knowledge, there is no option to turn toads off.\nThird, the game can last quite a while, and if you die early, the AI will slowly (even at max AI speed) complete each phase of each turn, dragging the game on far longer than any reasonably sane person would care to sit and watch the AI play.\n\nI have fun playing this game, don't get me wrong.  But most of the time, I'm having fun thinking about what the game COULD be, rather than what it really is.  It pains me to have to say this, but I cannot recommend the game.","July 27, 2014","false","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game seems like a pretty good choice.\nBut it has its flaws. Much unnecessary clicking, many delays. Games turn out to be very slow.\nSome people like to click for rolling the dice, but personally if no choices are left other than roll the dice.\nRoll dice -> choose destination (necessary) -> Survey the field (take cards) -> Fight the monster -> roll the dice for fight the monster. If only one step in this chain is necessary why not skip the other to speed up the game. I have no other choice to fight this monster so why do I have to tell the game I want to fight it and after that actually fight it with rolling the dice?\nThere are many Animations (e.g. dice rolling, moving, game effects, battle) and no way to skip them. Try to play a game with AI enemies and after half an hour you get frustrated. You don't want to see them roll the dice. You wait so long for your turn and most of what the AI actions will not even concern you.\n\nBut what drives me off most is the game mechanic. Chances for positive Events are not very high, its hard for your character to accumulate progress. And when you finally found items, compagnions you can have bad luck and loose everything by turning into a frog when rolling a bad number in the city. Or an enemy just casts a spell on you to reset your strength to the starting value so you cannot fight most of the monsters anymore.\nOf course every game has to have some negativ value to emphasize the positiv values. Its ok to loose an item, healthpoint or to wait one turn. But taking away so much from a player will make you rage. You can be at the very top and in the next moment you loose everything.\n\nThis game is far from balanced and although I really like the setting this game is so unforgiving for any awful roles.\nI would not recommend it, though the real life version would be possible playable because of its faster pace.\n\nThis game annoyed me like no other.","January 22, 2015","false","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a fair question: It is a very enjoyable board game, and a faithful recreation of the original source material. The gameplay is everything you would expect: Easy to pick up and play, harder to master, and the randomness of the card draws, the dice rolls and the shape of the board presence after about 50 turns in (and you will be playing more than this locally) means that no two games are ever the same in any playthrough, and victory is never certain: A risk-taking AI or one that gets better luck with their dice rolls could always be one step ahead of you, but there's always some way or another for the AI to be betrayed or lose their advantage, given the numerous random events that can transpire in the course of a game.\n\nWhy can I not recommend this game? Most who've played the board game or those who know how board games work in general know that it's better to play with friends. Unless you're willing to pass a laptop around - or play hot potato with the seat where your desktop is hiding out - the ability to play with friends since the 25th or so has nosedived. A quick look at the bug reporting section of the forums gives all the confirmation you may need: The change to the back-end of their online component has a lot of issues following a shift from a Steam-dependent component. I don't know why this change wasn't tested out before releasing it to the public (assuming that development costs aren't an issue) but it doesn't change the current state of the online component right now: A broken, unstable mess.\n\nHaving played several games online with the friends I also bought the game for, I got to experience some of these issues first-hand: Gameplay freezes after casting certain spells, the AI refuses to move in a timely manner in online games, starting up online games can sometimes be problematic to the point that you have to recreate the room (I always made mine private, but I would imagine this issue becomes worse for public rooms) and I've even experienced a crash in the 15-ish hours I've played this game online - or at least attempted to without any of these problems arising. Out of seven games, I only managed to have two completed: One was a two-player game, another a three-player that the other two players were forced to drop out of because they ended up having issues.\n\nSo to reiterate: In it's current state, this game is not completable online, in some cases it might not even be playable online. If you just want to play with your friends around the party table on a laptop or want to kill some time by yourself playing against some AI's, then this is a faithful recreation of the board game that you will get plenty of hours of enjoyment from (and given how the other 15 hours have been single-player and without any issues at all, I have no doubt of this). If you are, however, looking to play with friends over an online connection or have any desire to use the online component at all, then I have to recommend that you hold off until the issue is resolved with it's online component, as it is not in any fit state to be worth your time or your money.","December 28, 2014","false","49.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you enjoy the board game, you'll like the digital version. It has the advantage over the physical version in that it features:\n- AI players\n- Don't have to set up the board, shuffle the card, etc.\n- You don't have to explain the rules\n- You can play online (so you don't have to actually be in the same room as your friends)\n\nThe disadvantage is that playing it a sort of akin to playing with someone who is a pedant for the rules. Every action must have it's required 10 seconds of pause to allow other players the opportunity to counter or whatever. When everyone in a region must miss a turn, it won't just skip over everyone. It will say each player missed a turn, with its requisite timeout.\n\nPlaying the game online is also pretty buggy. In about half of the games I've played, the game has either:\n- frozen and not let a player do anything\n- randomly booted me from the game and "helpfully" replacing the other players with AIs. Once booted, you cannot easily rejoin a game.\n\nIt's worth noting the game does not pause. If you don't take your turn within the specified timeout, the AI will take over your character. It's really up to you to decide if this is good or not, but it is worth knowing.\n\nI'm not recommending this game because it offers little above being more convenient than the physical game, and because the online bugs are frustrating.","December 29, 2014","false","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It mostly consists of a lot of random dice rolls, lots of redundant clicking, and obfuscated information.\n\nThe overall gameplay feels like being on the cusp of winning a game of trivial pursuit, but you can't role the exact dice roll needed to land in the center of board. Or perhaps like a game of Chutes & Ladders where you never know whether you're going to go up or down.\n\nThe physical board game is probably much more fun. This game is probably also more fun if you're playing with some friends.\n\nThe game is a "traditional American" board game, where most of the gameplay is determined by random events, with very little choice left up to the player for how the game progresses. Random events can completely make or break the game for you.\n\nThere is some player interaction in the way of being able to cast counter spells during another player's turn, but the UI and digital game mechanics here are a bit wonky. The overall UI in fact is a bit wonky, in that it takes 5 clicks to complete every action or view any piece of information.\n\nI think I picked this game up while on sale for 99 cents, and I'm glad I didn't pay any more for it. If you like the random dice role and random card drawing type of game, and are willing to tolerate the cumbersome UI, then you might want to give it a go, but I still don't recommend paying more than a couple dollars for it.","December 30, 2014","false","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game seems like a pretty good choice.\nBut it has its flaws. Much unnecessary clicking, many delays. Games turn out to be very slow.\nSome people like to click for rolling the dice, but personally if no choices are left other than roll the dice.\nRoll dice -> choose destination (necessary) -> Survey the field (take cards) -> Fight the monster -> roll the dice for fight the monster. If only one step in this chain is necessary why not skip the other to speed up the game. I have no other choice to fight this monster so why do I have to tell the game I want to fight it and after that actually fight it with rolling the dice?\nThere are many Animations (e.g. dice rolling, moving, game effects, battle) and no way to skip them. Try to play a game with AI enemies and after half an hour you get frustrated. You don't want to see them roll the dice. You wait so long for your turn and most of what the AI actions will not even concern you.\n\nBut what drives me off most is the game mechanic. Chances for positive Events are not very high, its hard for your character to accumulate progress. And when you finally found items, compagnions you can have bad luck and loose everything by turning into a frog when rolling a bad number in the city. Or an enemy just casts a spell on you to reset your strength to the starting value so you cannot fight most of the monsters anymore.\nOf course every game has to have some negativ value to emphasize the positiv values. Its ok to loose an item, healthpoint or to wait one turn. But taking away so much from a player will make you rage. You can be at the very top and in the next moment you loose everything.\n\nThis game is far from balanced and although I really like the setting this game is so unforgiving for any awful roles.\nI would not recommend it, though the real life version would be possible playable because of its faster pace.\n\nThis game annoyed me like no other.","January 22, 2015","false","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The physical game is more expensive, especially if you end up buying all the other characters and expansions, so I would definitely suggest buying everything on steam and testing it all out to see what you like and don't like. It is also makes the rules very clear opposed to the physical copy, which makes you guess at some rules because of wording. All in all, I would suggest getting this game if you are at all interested in buying the physcal version. You may even like this version more, as you can always join tables online if you want to play but your friends are unavailable. It is sometimes buggy and won't load characters the first time you start it up and friends join, but that problem goes away the second time you start the game. I own both the physcial and PC version of this game, and though I prefer the physcial board game, I do enjoy this thoroughly.","May 18","true","47.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you don't know what Talisman is I'll sum it up real quick: turn based brain dead easy to play fantasy RPG inspired board game that revolves around basically 99% luck. Skill does matter to a degree, but you can and will get completely destroyed by unlucky dice rolls again, and again, and again, and again. This is not a competitive skill based game and it is highly recommended you play it when you are drunk/high/give no ♥♥♥♥s otherwise your friends will get mad at you when all their dice rolls are going great and then you proceed to steal all their stuff and win while doing absolutely nothing other than steal all their stuff.\n+: The game is mostly stable after several updates and performs great although it'd be impressive if it didn't considering it's a simplistic game.\n+: The DLC works similar to PAYDAY 2 where if one person has it everyone in the same game as that person also has it except for the character classes.\n-: If you buy this game even though you hate luck based game you're gonna have a bad time.\n-: Games do take a long amount of time, upwards of 4+ hours at times. Especially with the expansions on.\n-: The expansion DLCs come out so slow. :(","June 14, 2015","true","20.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

All the heros are fun, some more powerful than others, but every one of them can win if you manage to use its abilities to its full potential.\n\nAlthough there is some skill involved in this game, most of the player's performance is driven by luck. Preety much all actions (movement, combat, encounters) are defined/influenced by the dice rolls. This means that no matter how experienced you are, you can get destroyed by a noob who installed the game 10 minutes prier, which can be frustrating at times.\n\nAnother thing worth noting is that there are lots of possibilities for turning the tide in the middle of the game. This means that even if you're losing completely and the other players have much better stats than you, theres always a chance one of them will suddenly turn into a toad (and therefore leaving all objects/followers available to pickup) and allowing you to get all his stuff. Or maybe someone is about to enter the Crown of Comand (the place you need to reach to win the game) and you cast a spell on them and force him to loose his Talisman, the one object that allows them to get there. This triggers a lot of people, but i personally think it adds a lot to the game, and even though this stuff has happened to me numerous times, i end up having a laugh about it because at the end of the day, the game is fun. Just note that there's never a guaranteed win/loss, and you can always hope for a comeback or fear your demise!\n\nExpansions make the game a whole lot better, and the more you have, the more varied the game becomes and the more ways there are to make your way up to the top!\n\nPros:\n-Lots of fun with friends\n-Wide variety of heros\n-Playable on a toaster\n-Great to play at work (Tab in when it's your turn)\n-Unpredictable\n-Amazing when you have access to expansions\n-You dont have to purchase all the expansions in order to enjoy them provided that you play online with a player that owns them!\n\nCons:\n-Very luck driven\n-Games are super long\n-Not as enjoyable if you dont have access to expansions","May 30","true","107.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When making choices, you often have to consider the odds of an awful thing happening. Yet, even when the ONLY way something bad can happen is if I roll two 1's in a row, that's what WILL happen... and it doesn't happen infrequently. It happens over and over and over again. I've only EVER been able to get into the middle track once and no matter what character I play, the computer controlled players get nearly all good luck and I get nearly all bad luck. Frankly, it doesn't even feel like luck. It feels like the computer is actively controlling the dice rolls so it can hose me.\n\nThe game itself had ample opportunity to be enhanced graphically for a computer via animated cards and board and combat, but the developers chose to not do anything but reproduce the board and the cards exactly as they would appear when playing around a table. As a result, the computer game feels lifeless and utterly uninspired. Why not use the computer to do something the board game can't with some effects and such? The answer to that question is a mystery.\n\nThe user interface is simply horrible. Every moment of every turn is stretched out into a laborious sequence of moving and clicking. The game control elements are spread out all over the screen, so you have to move the mouse from one end of the screen to the other whenever an option is presented, rather than keeping the interface elements near one another so they are easy to use.\n\nOthers have reported a plethora of bugs. I can't say I've really encountered any, but then I've never actually played much beyond the beginning of any game. My 'luck' is SO bad that I can barely get started before I'm so far behind that catching up is impossible. It isn't much fun to continue playing when losing is a foregone conclusion, so I end up quitting to play something that is actually fun.","September 2, 2014","false","8.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've never heard of our played Talisman tabletop, but this turned out to be a BLAST for my wife and I. I got it with a bundle and gave it a try, and got sucked in quite terribly. For those of you who are as unfamiliar with Talisman as I was, It's essentially a ye old RPG in tabletop format. You pick your class, which offers different advantages per which class you choose, roll dice, move about the board, and do as the spaces require.  You collect gold, items, spells, armor, weapons and other items along the way. The ONE gripe I have with this game is that the dice mechanics are not completely random. They're favored for the AI and against you. They will often roll exactly what they need, and you'll roll exactly what you didn't want. This gets aggravating. I don't understand why the dice couldn't have been completely random? Otherwise, the game is a blast, especially with others.\n","February 19, 2015","true","51.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

First of all it is an alright adaptation of the game and it's as much fun to play as the board game, but there are a few bad points about it. 1) you cant see the board. only a crooked perspective that is far away or a zoom on one single field so it is really annoyingly hard to check out the board and the cards on it. 2) there are a lot of bugs and the game crashes sometimes when you use magic 3) the controls are bad. Often players do stuff they dont want to do because of that. It could be so simple, but they chose to make it complicated. 4) there is no punishment for leaving a game (like 30 min ban or so) so players ALWAYS leave when they draw a bad card, role a 1 or think they lose or have a bad character and so on. You will hardly ever finish a game online without players leaving.","April 4, 2015","true","13.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

No really - if you hang up on TeamSpeak and play it the experience is very simillar as actual board game.\n\nOverall there isn't much I could say against this game.

SOOOOOO glad I did.  My friends and I have a blast playing (I got a four pack) and I absolutely love the myriad of characters/classes.  Playing on random character choice is fun, though the AI has a thing for picking the Exorcist and excelling at it.  I once played a game where I eventually dispatched his Exorcist, forcing him to choose from 3 new classes, but he pratically gave up on his next choice (lasting a total of 3 turns) and the one after that!  His third set of classes included... yep, you guessed it: another Exorcist.  If it wasn't for the fact that I had snatched up all the Talismans, he might have won, garnering a large amount of strength, but after busting through and snatching a talisman from me, he lost his last two lives in the Vampire's lair.  Positioned strongly with a Marter with a massive amount of strength, I destroyed the Ice Queen and finally finished the game.\n\nThe computer AI in this game is great, but it seems a little cheap sometimes.  I'd like the ability to tweek the AI (unless I'm missing a portion in the options where you can) and a more stable online multiplayer (I've only had it mess up once for me, but I hear others complaining) but this game was worth every penny, and then some.  I got the Season Pass; all the extra content is great.  I highly recommend this for board game entusiasts or anyone looking for a great game to play, online or against AI.  Don't miss out on getting the season pass, either.  There are a TON of extras included, and it's not even halfway finished with it's "season" (you get every DLC that comes past, present, and future).  With the Highlands coming out (a new region, making a total of two additional regions (dungeon and highlands) on top of the basic board, you won't want to miss out on the extra adventure and danger!  Also, any DLC the host presents in their game, you'll be able to access (this includes characters and extra regions/cards) in their game.  If you plan on hosting games with your friends, DLC is a must have!  Trust me, the game is worth your money, and it's gotten me interested in getting the physical version for pure collection reasons!\n\nEDITS: Grammer (I'm sure there's still some mistakes) and reviews on DLC info.","January 5, 2015","true","68.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I had never played the boardgame and went blind into this one, together with 3 other people. We imidiately spent 9-10 hours into this game. The first game we played just vanila to get to know how the game works. It was quite fun already. After that we added the expansions and the game just got even better! The game can drag on quite a bit due to it's RNG... but it's the fun type of RNG, so that's totally okay!\n\nThe goal of the game is simple. You must be the first one to reach the middle. In the vanila version, you have the crown of command there, which will do damage to each other character 50% of the times (based on a d6 roll). Characters normaly respawn/get rerolled when they die, but not when someone is in the middle. If one player is left on the board, they win.\n\nThe game features quite a lot of characters to choose from. They all have their own set of stats, aswell as a set of special abilities of which some are shared, while others are unique. The most fun way to play, though, is that everyone starts with a random character and upon death they get a new, random character! During the game you will encounter many different kinds of events, monsters and items. The more expansions you have, the more random and sometimes deadly the game becomes.\n\nI would say, if you aren't sure about buying this one. First buy the vanila version only. Once you know if you'll like it, feel free to buy the rest of the DLC, they're all worth it. Though you do not need the Runestone Deck DLC, you can unlock these ingame as far as I know.\n\nEdit: The runestones basicly give you boosts to your character: you can start with more in a stat or you can more easily upgrade your character and so forth. They seem to be designed for those who want a game that'll end more swiftly. Personally I'd suggest to play without these, unless everyone has them and you want your game to end sooner.","June 25, 2014","true","83.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game is being ever improved and i think its unfair to have these lingering reviews about its early phase just laying around stinking up the place. I've only played the vanila game but i've enjoyed every hour of it...well every hour i wasn't a dam toad. Online games are only unstable when you get a whiney ♥♥♥♥♥ that leaves cause hes not winning. The only time a person leaving was "maybe" justified was this fellow that was toaded 4 times within like 10 turns. He had the worse fate rolls I've ever seen lol. Other then that though MAKE FREINDS! I just started freinding people who stick threw games to the bitter end. I expect my list to grow as i add more hours to the ticker.\n\nIF you want a more Fact based review:\nIts a fantasy game that feels like a mix of magic the gathering and D&D. Granted its more "shallow" forms of the two but threw the Hybrid style of play it becomes deep. THIS GAME NEEDS CONTEND and it gets it threw the expansions.\nHow do i know this? GUESS WHAT! if one person who owns all the expansions sets up a game then you don't need them to still play and enjoy the expansions. Granted its a little jaring to suddenly have new characters and endings but its also a very fun renewal to adventure. Also its a great way to see if you give a dam about the 5$ dlc or not.\n________________________________________________________________________________\nUPDATE 4/3/15: So wow this game finaly has the content it needs(as DLC mind you). As of writing this its only 5$ and free to play for the weekend. This is a god dam gem right now for this price. I still hate all the DLC but if you add the expansions (not individual character dlc) it comes to a modest 25-30$. I still have yet to see a justification for a 60$ seasons pass unless you must have EVERY ounce of DLC for this game. All gripes aside. Get it for you and your freinds. Enjoy it. Turn into a taod or maybe slay a vile Cold hearted queen.

A lot of bugs have been fixed (still a few kicking around). House rules implimented including the "standard character" rule for true fans who do not wish for the overpriced $2 dlc cards pay to win implimented.\n\nAnother great feature is now you can add and remove players while in lobby instead of totally rehosting. Not only to mention that players who only have the base game can join any game and still use all the dlc so long as the host has provided them.

I've never heard of our played Talisman tabletop, but this turned out to be a BLAST for my wife and I. I got it with a bundle and gave it a try, and got sucked in quite terribly. For those of you who are as unfamiliar with Talisman as I was, It's essentially a ye old RPG in tabletop format. You pick your class, which offers different advantages per which class you choose, roll dice, move about the board, and do as the spaces require.  You collect gold, items, spells, armor, weapons and other items along the way. The ONE gripe I have with this game is that the dice mechanics are not completely random. They're favored for the AI and against you. They will often roll exactly what they need, and you'll roll exactly what you didn't want. This gets aggravating. I don't understand why the dice couldn't have been completely random?

First of all it is an alright adaptation of the game and it's as much fun to play as the board game, but there are a few bad points about it. 1) you cant see the board. only a crooked perspective that is far away or a zoom on one single field so it is really annoyingly hard to check out the board and the cards on it. 2) there are a lot of bugs and the game crashes sometimes when you use magic 3) the controls are bad. Often players do stuff they dont want to do because of that. It could be so simple, but they chose to make it complicated. 4) there is no punishment for leaving a game (like 30 min ban or so) so players ALWAYS leave when they draw a bad card, role a 1 or think they lose or have a bad character and so on.

SOOOOOO glad I did.  My friends and I have a blast playing (I got a four pack) and I absolutely love the myriad of characters/classes.  Playing on random character choice is fun, though the AI has a thing for picking the Exorcist and excelling at it.  I once played a game where I eventually dispatched his Exorcist, forcing him to choose from 3 new classes, but he pratically gave up on his next choice (lasting a total of 3 turns) and the one after that!  His third set of classes included... yep, you guessed it: another Exorcist.  If it wasn't for the fact that I had snatched up all the Talismans, he might have won, garnering a large amount of strength, but after busting through and snatching a talisman from me, he lost his last two lives in the Vampire's lair.  Positioned strongly with a Marter with a massive amount of strength, I destroyed the Ice Queen and finally finished the game.\n\nThe computer AI in this game is great, but it seems a little cheap sometimes.  I'd like the ability to tweek the AI (unless I'm missing a portion in the options where you can) and a more stable online multiplayer (I've only had it mess up once for me, but I hear others complaining) but this game was worth every penny, and then some.  I got the Season Pass; all the extra content is great.  I highly recommend this for board game entusiasts or anyone looking for a great game to play, online or against AI.  Don't miss out on getting the season pass, either.  There are a TON of extras included, and it's not even halfway finished with it's "season" (you get every DLC that comes past, present, and future).  With the Highlands coming out (a new region, making a total of two additional regions (dungeon and highlands) on top of the basic board, you won't want to miss out on the extra adventure and danger!  Also, any DLC the host presents in their game, you'll be able to access (this includes characters and extra regions/cards) in their game.  If you plan on hosting games with your friends, DLC is a must have!  Trust me, the game is worth your money, and it's gotten me interested in getting the physical version for pure collection reasons!\n\nEDITS: Grammer (I'm sure there's still some mistakes) and reviews on DLC info.","January 5, 2015","true","68.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is often critisized for being overly dependent on luck at the expense of strategy by those who deride such types of games.  I like to refer to it as fantasy Monopoly, where instead of property you go around collecting objects and followers (and battle enemy monsters and players) until you're powerful enough to win the game.\n\nDespite its detractors, Talisman has maintained a passionate, loyal and extremely devoted following.  Like Monopoly, its appeal lies in its simple, light-hearted and accessible nature that isn't complicated, difficult or overly strategic.  In other words, the very things it is criticised for.  That's not to say there aren't strategic elements but they're certainly not dominant.  It's a game you can wistfullly play while the hours pass by (and I do mean hours) without thinking too much.  If that's not to your liking, there are plenty of other more serious games to consider.\n\nTalisman benefits enormously from the digital transition which has been implemented fairly well, with some exceptions.  Most notably are occasional bugged rules and weak AI players, but these don't detract too much from the enjoyment of the game.  I was pleasently surprised by the friendliness of online players also.\n\nIf you appreciate light-hearted and fun games that anyone can pick up or enjoy board games with great artwork on the board and the cards then I can highly recomment Talisman.  I have over 100 hours logged so far and I find it's a great (and addictive) distraction and great to take your mind off things.\n\nI should note that the base game is a little bare and Talisman benefits when played with some of the expansions.  The season pass is also fairly pricey, but I got it on sale so I think it's good value if you can wait until a sale.  Given the number of characters and expansions I can't recommend buying them separetely.  You really have to go all in and get the season pass if you want the extra content.  It's not worth buying expansions in dribs and drabsm but if you had to I'd say Reaper, Frostmarch and Sacred Pool are recommended first because they don't add extra boards (regions) that chcange the game a bit.","February 17","true","219.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm used to playing highly competitive shooters and the like, so if I can enjoy it, almost anyone can.

I've played the tabletop version of Talisman before and always thought it was an awful game. I love board games, have dozens of them, but Talisman... It takes the features of games like Monopoly and other trail games and try to entice you with a mildly interesting (though generic) fantasy setting, but the truth is it remains as boring, flawed and outdated as Monopoly itself.\n\nThe game may drag for hours and hours without an ending in sight and everything is about randomness. There's no skill involved playing in Talisman, all you can do push your luck in a general direction and hope for the best. I understand why a game like this would be popular 20 or 30 years ago, but today we have plenty of better board (and digital) games to play. Maybe *huge* fans of Mario Party would enjoy playing digital Talisman, but I just can't recommend it to anyone else. You want to play "digital board games" on Steam? Grab "Small World 2", "Ticket to Ride" or anything else, but stay away from Talisman.","April 4, 2015","false","5.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I was pretty patient about it, I faithfully reported bugs when I saw them and waited months but rather than fix the old content they kept shoveling out new content. Making Android and Itunes adaptions and adding the expansion with a half ♥♥♥♥♥ game production.\n\n\nThe UI is terrible, it places the “accept” and “drop” button as close as possible to each other making it very easy to misclick. It lacks any sense of forethought or planning.\n\nThe AI is a roomba bot gone rogue. It attacks the same players over and over even though it will obviously lose. It has almost no sense for self preservation and almost always dies. Or it cheats when it gets certain objects like the magic carpet and rolls 6's non stop.\n\nThe games had so many bugs from the beginning the developers have failed to either realize themselves or fix themselves. If they needed more money than they should have made the game advertisement supported with a paid option for people who didn't want the ads. This would have brought in a larger player base and gave people the chance to try it out. They also could have given the starting game for free and then sold the expansion and characters for more.\n\nThe general stability of the game is terrible, it crashes so often, that games frequently have to be resumed. Resume is the one saving grace of this game but in spite of all of that, the general incompetence of the developers ruins what could otherwise be a wonderful game.\n\nI can't recommend this game to anyone until the developers stop shoveling new content and fix what they have now.","August 19, 2014","false","777.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Clunky UI makes playing a harsh experience. Others mentioned that this was a mobile port and it shows. Settings are limited and it will reset some of the options every time you restart the game. Some features, like speeding up or skipping animations are not available, which tends to drag games even longer than required.\n\nHas some technical issues. With nearly 10 hours gametime, there has been couple crashes. Also, one friend kept having connection issues for unknown reason. Luckily, the session can be restored but it still requires extra time. Cashing on too many DLCs and extra junk that could have been easily bundled in bigger packages. Luckily, only the server has to buy them so that others can play with additional content. Some of the characters are much stronger than others which brings balancing issues.\n\nCore game mechanic relies too heavily on dice, especially in the early game. As most of the actions are ruled by the dice, one can find hero facing only dragons, giants and ogres with their two point strength weakling. This results in frustration as the player cannot really do anything except pray for better luck. Situation becomes ever worse with the DLCs as they bring even more monsters which makes encounters even more random. Core game could use separate decks for outer and middle regions. This way outer region could give more certain, but slow, early progress and middle region faster but more risky way.\n\nUsually some of the players get lucky in the early game and snowball out of control. When hero gets enough resources, they start to win battles automatically which makes them even stronger. Single game can easily last two hours as the early winning players makes certain that they are unbeatable until finishing the game.\n\nSummary: technically shoddy and somewhat lacking playing experience. Can be fun with friends. Recommended only for Talisman fanatics. Others should avoid or enjoy the life as a toad.","December 28, 2014","false","13.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

But if you don't mind that, it's not a bad game.  Believe the devs when they say the dice don't cheat?  You cannot convince me.  Here is just one tale of one game I played:\n\nYes, I have read that they claim all dice rolls are generated before the game even starts and the order doesn't change, ie no cheating dice.  I call BS.  Pushed my way to the crown and suddenly of the 3 AI players, 2 start doing everything they can to help/save the 4th.  The fourth starts making amazing rolls and I realize I'm only getting above a 3 one in seven rolls.  Amazing given it should be roughly 50/50 chance.  But for 40 rolls I only get 6 above a 3.  Because the other 2 AI were even using their healing spells on the 4th that means it was down to me and that 4th AI.  He bounces around the board always managing to land any time I get manage to get his health down by 2, collect 7 followers, 7 items, crazy stats, and heads for the portal that's been up since the start of the game.  About this time I get him down to 1 health and think, "Surely, this must be almost over."  Two rounds later he gets to the portal and of course rolls a 6 putting him in the Plains near the end.  Three rounds later he has rolled a 1 at the vampire and a 1 at the Pitfiends.  He's still at 1 health and I've now rolled 7 times less than a 4.  He keeps coming and I keep failing to roll above a 3.  Right before he gets to the crown I manage to roll a 6 and take him out.  The game sustained a 1 in 7 chance of rolling a 4, 5, or 6 on a six sided die for an hour.  Just me clicking "next" cause once you get to the crown there's nothing else you can do.  Exciting.  That was just one game.  Will not play again.

This game takes hours to complete. The online games take even longer. Those three  reasons are what stopped me from trying this out earlier but I did try it out and I was NOT disappointed. Despite the length, most people who you play with online are super friendly and super fun to play with, which basically ends up making the length an advantage (more time = more fun). And the game itself is amazing! It's like playing a full scale MMORPG (an RPG if you don't like online play xD)! It's a game, a board game, that truly does require a huge amount of strategy. It's not just "roll you dice, move on, get to the end first", it's about thinking of where to go, what to do, how to get what you want and so on. And it's not very straightforward either, it's quite complex and utterly wonderful in all aspects. To sweeten the pot, it even has several modes and expansions to make sure you never get bored of playing! A 5/5 game if I ever played one.\n\nEDIT: I must admit that after a while, the game does get quite boring and repetitive. If you can find a group of players and form a group (relatively speaking) to play, then sure, it'll give you hours of enjoyment without fail! Besides, considering how long a game takes, you'll probably end up playing it once or twice a week, in which case it'll provide you with years of fun!\n\nOne thing I have noticed, however, is that the community has died down quite a bit. Ever since the "free weekend" ended, the number of games in the lobby is three in the maximum and that's in the European server (which, ironically, is the busiest). Once again, if you've got a group of friends to play with every once in a while, I'd recommend this game without a single moment of hesistation!","April 6, 2015","true","77.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jinsaku/recommended/247000/","jinsaku","Jinsaku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jinsaku/","1022 products in account","One of the best board games of a long past era, Talisman evokes the core of 1980s RNG heavy dice rolling board games. For those of us who lived in that time, before Germany came along and showed the world how great board games can be, this is a well realized throwback nostalgia title.\n\nThat's not to say Talisman is a great board game. It's really not. It's exceptionally RNG heavy and can be frustrating at times. But, it's also pretty fun. Particularly when playing with a group of friends over Skype, Mumble, etc. The game itself is very easy to learn. Roll a die. Move. Do what's on the board. Try to improve your character enough to get to the center, defeat the challenge, and win the game.\n\nThe software implementation of Talisman by Nomad is pretty good. The animations and sounds are good, the graphics are pretty, and it plays the way you would expect. We've only run into a few bugs, one game-breaking, over a bunch of sessions. One of the really nice things Nomad did was allow the host's version of Talisman to be played. I have the full season pack, and a bunch of my friends have the core game only. I host, and we can play with all of the expansions.\n\nThere are 3 expansions out so far. The best one at the moment is The Dungeon, which adds a large board segment to one of the corners. I'm very much looking forward to when all of the expansions are out and you can play a big mega game.\n\nGame time can run a bit long. While this is faster than the tabletop version, budget about one hour per player per game.\n\nI recommend, but this definitely isn't for everyone. I sunk about 100 hours into Talisman Prologue (which was their single-player "Beta" version of this and about a dozen hours so far for the full release. This is a fun one to pull out once in a while with friends, like any good board game.","December 24, 2014","true","55.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","3"

The game can get very cut-throat and you will enjoy lots of laughs at the expese of other player's misfortune. The expansions make the game even more enjoyable and there are different game rules available that can make the game more exciting. If I was recommending this on the gameplay alone, I would definitely give it a great review.\n\nThat being said, this game is TERRIBLE when it comes to programming. It is full of game-stopping glitches that should have been weeded out during development. Nothing is more frustrating than to be two hours into a highly competitive and exciting game, only to have it RUINED by a glitch that will not allow the game to contine. The matchmaking is shotty at best, and the lack of a save feature to save and resume multiple games outside of the single automatic game save really gets on your nerves.

First play I stayed completely lost in the game for several turns, the cards were showing up too fast and I had no idea of what was going on.\n\nAfter understanding a little of what was going on I tryed to play with random AI characters. I lost 3 encounters in a row on the first 3 tutns and died, while the AI got several followers and Items. Just a bad experience, ok I rage quit and restart.\n\nSecond go: Oponent first turns rolls to other side of the river, flips 3 cards gets 7 gold. My first turn Dragon. Another bad experience, ok...\n\nThird try I realized I could set AI speed, I realized I could pause the game and check on the cards, but I still dont know where the buffs and debuffs are coming from, I loose battle even though I win battles, a guy fights me with 2 strenght and suddenly he has 8 strenght. I lost 3 turns in a row, frogged, one of my oponents has talisman, belt of strenght, solomons crown and a unicorn, I died once, got lost in cave and lost all my gold gambling.\n\nLong story short, I played the game times, never drew an equipment,the only follower i had was a hag and I died several times, while having no tooltips hints or decent tutorial, it took me an hour to realize my re-rolls were consuming fate counters and I couldn't understanding why it was not working anymore. I rage quit all of the games I started.\n\nSome my say it was just a bad luck or the game is hard, I see it as a very very bad experience that was worsen by the fact that the game leaves you in the dark.\n\nI still don't know what trophies are for, ehat happens when you fight a player, what's the point of capturing a wolf as follower and what or where is the chasm.\n\n[UPDATE]\n\nJust found out the dice rolls are rigged, no matter how many times I load the game on the same save spot, the dice results for ALL the rolls are the same, even the fate re-rolls are the sam.

It seems like every time you do anything there is a tiny confirmation button to hit, even in situations where you have no choices and you see the same information on the next screen.\n\nThe interface doesn't take any advantage of being on a computer. For example the basic choice in the game choosing between moving between two spaces after rolling a dice.  It plays it just like the board game, "helping" by highlighting the squares you can move to.  You can right click (with the previously mentioned delay) to see what those spaces actually are.  Why doesn't the game keep the board in the background and bring up popups with information about your move choices?\n\nI can't think of many people who wouldn't be happier sticking to the board game if they're a fan, or if not playing a different game entirely.","April 14, 2015","false","2.2"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","12","24","0","2"

Do you own boardgames? Do you play them with your friends (hopefully!)? Than this game CAN definatly be for you. But it also depends on how much nostalgia you feel for Talisman. Us boardgamers in general probably wont like this game, it takes a lot of time (can take up to 3 hours), your actions are ALMOST completley random thanks to dicerolling. And you also lose the feeling of moving components around on a board which is a huge part of the enjoyment for this game.\n\nIf you're a not a boardgamer I would recomend that you stay away from this game. It probably wont meet up with any (if any) of your expectations. This game can be fun with a few friends but you will probably end up only playing a single game of it before moving on to some other game or you know... any other REAL boardgame.\n\nTalisman in general is sadly not a great boardgame nomatter how much nostalgia you feel for it.\nIt's basicly a more nerdy version of Monopoly which is the worst... boardgame... ever. Instead of getting this get the game for your pads so that you can play it on long trips on a buss, train, car (unless you're driving) and plane.

Others pass...\n\nPros\n- Lots of Characters\n- Lots of Cards, Spells, & Events\n- Easy to play while multi-tasking (TV, other games, ect.)\n- Online multiplayer content.\n\nCons\n- Too much DLC\n- I swear dice are rigged vs AI\n- Graphics could be better.\n- Repetative music.\n- Many mechanics to learn & employ.\n\nSo, I'm not big on board games. I got this in a Humble Bundle & decided to try it out. For a board game, it's pretty entertaining. That's why I gave it a 7/10 & a thumbs up. If it weren't a board game, I'd give it a 4/10. The game flow is pretty boring & the DLC is somewhat frustrating.\n\nIt's great that they want to keep the game up-to-date, & I don't expect them to work for free. However there's a bit of a pay-to-win feel, when you're looking at some of the newer content. It's not just new event cards, or "Alternative Ending Cards". It's new characters with OP abilities, or OP "Runes" (upgrades to base stats).\n\nI also wish there was more flash & awe while playing the game. I mean, you pick up a "blizzard" card; you expect to see the board covered in a wash of hail! You have tons of spells, but nothing beyond the card's artwork to help you imagine the effect! The game falls a bit flat when it comes to graphic possibilites.\n\nThe same goes for the music. It's not bad, but it rarely changes. It's so monotonous. With so many events & the dynamic of "who's winning", alignments, what board section your in, ect. you'd think there'd me more variety.\n\nI complained about the game's loaded dice vs AI. I rolled a "1" 5 times in a row on the same square. This happened twice in one game, then once again in the following game. While it's not impossible to do, it's highly improbable. If the dice aren't loaded, maybe I should play the lottery...\n\nThere's some strategy, but for the most part the strategy is overriden by the RNG of the dice rolls. Personally, I'd be more entertained with a game of Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone. You have a greater feeling of control, knowing what's in your hand & in your deck. In Talisman: Digital Edition, nothing is guarenteed. You can have 8 godly items one moment; nothing the next. There's nothing you can do about it, & it just makes you feel like the game is a big waste of time.\n\nLastly, there are a lot of quirks with regard to when & how you do things. I had a "Siphon Strength" card that I tried using for 10 turns. Suddenly it worked on an opponent that I never selected nor was he near me; just a random event. You need to learn which items are consumed on use, and which arn't. Or maybe you got turned into a toad. Is it worth it for you to land on that spot that gives you +1 Strength? Apparently not.\n\nIf you like board games, then perhaps you'd be willing to learn all the quirks of this game. Personally, I'd rather play something more intuitve & gratifying. I may play this on occation if I'm stuck watching TV with the kids, but there are many other games that can fill the time with a better sense of achievement.","May 3, 2015","true","19.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You just go where it tells you, deal with whatever good/bad thing that happens, then wait for your next turn.\n\nNot only is the gameplay horrendous, but it's littered with reminders to purchase tons of overpriced DLC.

Do you own boardgames? Do you play them with your friends (hopefully!)? Than this game CAN definatly be for you. But it also depends on how much nostalgia you feel for Talisman. Us boardgamers in general probably wont like this game, it takes a lot of time (can take up to 3 hours), your actions are ALMOST completley random thanks to dicerolling. And you also lose the feeling of moving components around on a board which is a huge part of the enjoyment for this game.\n\nIf you're a not a boardgamer I would recomend that you stay away from this game. It probably wont meet up with any (if any) of your expectations. This game can be fun with a few friends but you will probably end up only playing a single game of it before moving on to some other game or you know... any other REAL boardgame.\n\nTalisman in general is sadly not a great boardgame nomatter how much nostalgia you feel for it.\nIt's basicly a more nerdy version of Monopoly which is the worst... boardgame... ever. Instead of getting this get the game for your pads so that you can play it on long trips on a buss, train, car (unless you're driving) and plane.

You will have to minimize the steam window else the game will always turn to windowed mode at startup\n- the boardgames original graphics on the board itself are way (and I mean WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY) more detailed than the blurry ♥♥♥♥ they serve you in this conversion here (though I have to admit I don't own the games the Games Workshop version of the boardgame, so it may be they are poorly done and do suck nowadays too.)\n- Some rules can be changed (what is good) but why can't i for eg say let's have "N" numbers of randomly chosen characters to select from in the beginning?\n- The descriptions on the single fields on the board don't include the inscriptions (and they wouldn't have been able to be read either if impelemented in the same blurry way like the background graphics), you have to click on them first to see it, and it must be your turn to be able to do so. WHY THE HECK? Include a tooltip you d*mb*ss programmers ... how old are you?\n- ...\n\nYou know what? I don't have the time and / or the mood to write more about this as it turns out to be more and more to be a list of easyliy implementable ideas others get paid for. So if you wanna know how to do this game "pixelperfect" to it's true original form than contact me if you are one of the devs.\n\nOne more thing:\n\nYou wanna know the moment I rage quited the game?\n\nHere it is all about it:\n\nI played an elv. I found a wizards staff and got myself a spell. I wanted to use the spell the next round because I disliked the one I got and wanted to get a new one (by using the staff again). The spell was the one that blocks another player or enemy for one turn. As I should select one character to cast the spell on I selected a figure of another player on the board. This didn't work. Then I thought, ok click on the charakters Icon and I clicked on myself to test if it works and you know what? It did work. It showed my card AND another button where I could choose to do cast the spell. BUT NO "GO BACK" BUTTON?\n\nWTF?!?!?!?\n\nAs I said, contact me if you want to overdo this game to a GOOD game that is worth the big name it's released under, but don't expect to get more infos or ideas for free ... Or is it free to get all the characters THAT FOR ALL TIME WHERE INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BOARDGAME in this software version?\n\n...\n\nAnd now everyone please hate me for this review and vote me down ...\n\n*lol*\n\n@ngel","April 5, 2015","false","2.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

Started playing it last week w/ my 10-yr old.  We're having F-U-N-!-!  However, he has a curfew, and I have a long work commute, so we play maybe 30 minutes a night and it's slow.  Still fun.  However, I found this Digital Edition, and O My God is it FUN!  Just won my first match ever (boardgame or PC) and it was awesome.  I think what I like most about it is that the Digital Edition really enforces the rules quite a bit on what I would have considered "grey areas" of the original rules for the boardgame.  I am very fond of this game and would highly recommend this over the Prologue edition.  Prologue does NOT allow you to play with at least one other AI opponent, and that kind of sucks!  You learn a lot more playing with a full-on opponent.  This one tonight (Priest) in particular really had me on the ropes, the one I played last night (Assasin) not so much.  Any Hearthstone players out there?  Give this a shot - much MORE strategy and the animations are just as fun!

There does seem to be one bug with the thief, though: when at the crown of command with another character, he still had the opportunity to steal, despite his character card saying he needed to LAND on the character's space in order to steal from them. Not sure if that was an interpretation thing, an error, or some kind of bug in the code, but thought it was worth mentioning.\n\noverall, though, just like the boardgame.

If you’ve played Talisman on a board or are a fan of tabletop RPGs, odds are you’ll have a blast playing with people from all over the world (or the AI) and I easily recommend purchasing it.  If you aren’t a fan of tabletop or haven’t played it, be aware that Talisman: Digital Edition is not like your typical videogame.  It’s more akin to a board game, and therefore is a sort of niche title.  I’d recommend at least trying it through Steam’s Family Share if possible, or watch extended gameplay trailers to get an idea of what to expect.  I've never played the original board game, so I can't really compare the two.  But for the most part, I found this to be a really enjoyable game.  Even more so as I am an avid boardgamer as well, so now I'll have to find a copy of the physical version later on.\n\nAs an added bonus, what makes this version of the game stand out against its real-life counterpart is the player progression scheme.  After you beat the game (or even lose it), you earn experience points based on your performance and are rewarded with Runestones and Steam Achievements.  There are fifty achievements on Steam and you can equip your next hero with up to three Runestones which can affect everything from starting lives to not missing a turn when your hero drinks too much in the tavern!  This progression will keep you coming back for more play sessions as you try to accomplish something you didn’t earn in your last play-through.\n\nA really great game if you're into these types of games.","June 29, 2014","true","48.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Started playing it last week w/ my 10-yr old.  We're having F-U-N-!-!  However, he has a curfew, and I have a long work commute, so we play maybe 30 minutes a night and it's slow.  Still fun.  However, I found this Digital Edition, and O My God is it FUN!  Just won my first match ever (boardgame or PC) and it was awesome.  I think what I like most about it is that the Digital Edition really enforces the rules quite a bit on what I would have considered "grey areas" of the original rules for the boardgame.  I am very fond of this game and would highly recommend this over the Prologue edition.  Prologue does NOT allow you to play with at least one other AI opponent, and that kind of sucks!  You learn a lot more playing with a full-on opponent.  This one tonight (Priest) in particular really had me on the ropes, the one I played last night (Assasin) not so much.  Any Hearthstone players out there?  Give this a shot - much MORE strategy and the animations are just as fun!

Even compared to Chainsaw Warrior, card game that really snuffs out the players 9 out of 10 times, this game always felt way too artificial under the colorful hood.\n\nWell now...\n\nI've uninstalled the game and reinstalled it today when I saw there's a Humble Bundle package with some additional content available for a low price. I was just about to buy and indulge in playing muted Talisman and listening to audiobook again when a buddy of mine made me read a shocking post by a developer himself.\n\nThat post is available at Steam's community hub for Talisman: Digital Edition and it explains in detail the horrid decision of game devs that I really don't understand at all.\n\nThe most important part is this one and no, it's not taken out of context:\n\n"At the start of a new game, a huge list of random numbers between 1 and 6 is generated. That list of numbers is used for the whole game, in the order that they are determined at this point."\n\nI understand it this way - in the game based on factor of random dice rolls, you get a predetermined row of numbers which influence your moves. There are no true random dice rolls, no luck. Only a rigging generator.\n\nThis decision truly crushes my enthusiasm to play this game any longer and to buy any new content. I am sorry, but I don't see any point of dice rolling when my game is (almost completely) predetermined. When I buy a game that relies on dice rolls, I want random dice rolls. There's no excuse for this sad state of affairs and although I never do this, I urge you all to vote this review up so people prove to the devs changes have to be made to make a great game - great.","October 25, 2015","false","3.7"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","11","22","2","8"

I can not stress this idea enough. I spent half an hour trying to kill the only remaining Swashbuckler in a 1 vs. 5 AI game. He would not simply die. What i mean by this, is that he would honestly get down to 1 life point remaining and then miraculously roll the die into the perfect number to land on a square in which he could heal. It did not also help that he had a card that gave him a minimum of 1 gold at all times. The game finally ended when the AI moved him into the most inner ring where he had no methods of self healing.\n\nOverall it's a great game and lives up to the experiences i've had through the actual irl gameboard.

I don't know if you can still buy them, but back then you could get, like, a dozen expansions that came with additional game boards like a dungeon and one that allowed you to travel through space. My brother and I liked playing the expansions more than the vanilla game because every expansion added these wicked overpowered new characters and objects and instead of the usual gameplay strat of "just travel around the outer region for a half an hour to level up before going towards the middle" it became "bum rush the space lanes to get the laser rifle and the anti-grav belt and spend the next fifteen minutes griefing the other players until they get mad and give up".\n\nDad says: If you like this kind of nerd ♥♥♥♥, it's a pretty good buy at $5, but bear in mind that the vanilla game will get old after a couple of hours once you're familliar with all the cards and/or you don't have actual people to play with on mumble. You'll be wanting to get some of the expansions if you enjoy it and those will cost like $5 each, but they should mix up the game enough that you'll find lots of added enjoyment.

Whilst I have many fond memories of Talisman from my childhood, this is a terrible implementation of a game that has long past exceeded its best-by date.\n\nTalisman itself is sadly lacking in the current era of boardgames, with little to no strategy or choice left to the player. It is dictated far more by the random roll of the die, than any particular desire of the player. Even Monopoly provides more strategy, and choice of action. This is a faithful implementation of the original, for what little that is worth.\n\nThe main issue is the interface, which is an abomination. Trying to play with friends rapidly becomes an excercise in extreme frustration, wherein you battle the shoddy controls - instead of battling your friends. Laggy, unresponsive and unintuitive are the nicest words I have to say about it. I wish I could refund it, and I feel terrible for gifting it to several of my friends who now all have a much poorer opinion of me.\n\nIf you have any fondness for Talisman, any decent memories of the game - leave them as that, memories.

The programmers haven't solved that problem well at all. Computer opponents don't have much strategy besides accumulating stats and items. They perform like mediocre bots in the single-player training missions of an online FPS. A human player would wipe the table with them every time, except the AI appears to get a boost via favorable die rolls and card draws, likely to disguise its lack of real strategy. The first few games this doesn't matter much, but after dozens of games it sucks the enjoyment out of it.\n\nIf you have 3 friends willing to play the game with you, I'd buy this game in a heartbeat. If you're going to fill in with computer players--and especially if you just want to play single-player--this is probably a pass.\n\nFor that reason--plus constant problems connecting with servers resulting in interrupted games--I have to give this game a no vote even though I generally like it.

At that price, you really can't go that wrong.  That being said, this game really walks the line between whether or not to give it a positive or a negative review overall.\n\nThe design flaws of the Talisman game really manifest itself when you play with a rigid, impassionate interpreter of the game.   This doesn't seem like a bad thing, but Talisman has evolved over the years with very little consistency: there's a huge variety of nuances in the language used.  Phrases such as "...at any time..." implies a different expectation than what is actually practiced in the game.\n\nThe honest truth is, people zone out when they play Talisman.  You miss a few turns in jail, or wait for four other players to battle dragons, abuse spells, and ponder over quests; just so you can roll a 3 and scoop up a bag of gold.  There's a whole layer missing from the electronic version of the game that you get when you are playing on the tabletop with your friends that really is the only thing that makes Talisman an acceptable use of an afterrnoon.\n\nThe game would also benefit from an ability to remove specific cards from out of the deck; because there are some really grossly imbalanced combinations as well as cards you just get sick of seeing- like the one that takes all the face up city cards and put them on top of the adventure deck.  The electronic version of the game also takes longer to play, as every step of the game is iterated out individually.  The dice roller seems very suspect as well.  I've had back to back snake eyes when dicing with death as well as +3 Craft from the Reaper in three stops.\n\nThe game does give you something to do while your waiting in a que or auto-running to your next mission, but it's hard to recommend solely on the experience it offers.  To be honest, considering how horribly overpriced the Fantasy Flight version of the game is, I would still recommend this version of the game over the table top version.  I'm sticking with my 2nd Edition Games Workshop version.","December 1, 2015","false","53.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

There's a board. There are cards, characters and a die. Great.\n\nUnfortunately once you actually start to play you realize pretty quickly that you're dealing with a tablet port that's had oodles of time put into it on the dlc-front, but not so much on  the optimizing-for-pc front. There's the base game, then several expansions, then I don't even know how many characters for a buck or three apiece, and there ain't a thing wrong with any of that assuming the game plays well and stable on the average pc.\n\nThat's where things begin to break down. There's a very long-standing and unresolved bug affecting a lot of people wherein if you afk from the game for anything more than about 60 seconds or so you'll return to a frozen screen, which you can only "fix" by force-closing the game in Task Manager and restarting. There's thread after thread after report after report on the Discussions page, and each says the same thing: "File a bug report and email it to us w/a log" and that's about it. There's been no solution to date, one year on, but boy oh boy have there been dlc galore in that time.\n\nThe game interface itself is, to be charitable, minimal. There's very little in the way of options in the settings menu, in the main game UI you'll be left to pretty much figure things out on your own since there's no tutorial of any kind, and no game manual that I've ever been able to find that outlines basic rules, etc. I played the game for months before realizing that I could click on the bar at the top of the screen that shows the current turn, and that that would show me details about turn events like card text, who rolled what, and so on.\n\nIn the same vein there are very, very few input options. You may use your mouse, and... that's almost it. Again, I played for months before discovering that clicking the spacebar = selecting whatever option is at the top right on your screen, be it "encounter space" or "move here" or whatever. There are no keys that do anything else whatsoever that I've seen. Again this is something that's been requested for a year on the forums, the ability to map some keys to common actions, and from what I can see the response has been the same every time: "Because it would take a lot of time to code for different OS's, the game is kept basically in a tablet state to make it simpler on us devs". Again, that constraint hasn't stopped them pumping out character and expansion dlc. That's the gist of it, anyway, so ask yourself if you want to pay 15 bucks for a tablet game on your pc.\n\nGame bugs: no shortage of 'em. Spell queueing is hit and miss, at best. Sometimes they work as you expect, other times they don't fire off at all or they do but not where you intended. There are cards that don't work at all in certain situations and cards that work in unexpected ways in others. Multiplayer games freeze and/or disconnect a random person, in addition to the aforementioned single player freeze.\n\nThere is little to no hovertext, which in a game where you're forced to play with your mouse almost exclusively leads to a LOT of clicking. If you want to remind yourself what stipulations exist on a certain game square, for instance, you must click that square. This is fine unless you accidentally double-click, which is easy enough to do, at which point your character *moves* to that square whether you're finished reading its text or not. The same goes for many cards like spells or potions. Be careful clicking on them if you're simply trying to read them. One extra click and poof! there goes that spell you totally didn't intend to cast yet.\n\nI could go on but there's not much point. It *is* a game, and it *is* playable, but it isn't all that enjoyable to me to the point I'd recommend it to anyone, and the reason I go so far as to give it a thumbs down is simple: after months of waiting, pleading, begging the devs to show a little love to the pc community (whose money they seem to love enough, alright) their response was to post a new thread announcing an upcoming new Talisman game they're working on. Presumably we were all meant to shout "Yay! Take my money!", but to me it felt like someone who'd just mugged me asking if I'd like to buy my wallet back.\n\nAgain, if you're a hardcore fan of the original, this will probably fulfill your digital desire to play, but it ain't gonna be a bug-free or hassle-free experience. If you're new to the gamel I'd recommend giving it a pass, unless the devs decide to pay it the attention they should've been paying from the start.","February 2","false","86.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The worst one even doesn't let you start the multiplayer match in 4 out of 5 tries, when the option "Character selection" (out of 3 Chars) is enabled, which usually is enabed for fair play. When this happens, the first player doesn't get a hero to choose from and so the room needs to be rehosted. More than that, the game crashes randomly or you just disconnect from the server, with sometimes beeing unable to rejoin the game. I've made a 4 player match where one player left the game at the beginning. Not a big deal, it happens often and the KI took over and the remaining three players continued to play for three hours. Then the player who left returned, which caused a crash to the other three players, while one was already at the crown and the game would have ended 10 minutes later. Great, three hours played for noting than frustration. The commentary of the returning player: "Oh, I made it back right in time". D o u c h e b a g -.-\n\nSingleplayer works fine, KI is ok, but since you normally want to play against other humans and not against the KI, this game sucks more often than it makes fun.","February 7","false","56.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

However, I am talking about the original board game, not the digital edition. I am not going to describe the single player feature as it is very poor and AI does not demand any thinking from the player, making the single player game easy, boring and discouraging. Therefore, I will concetrate on the multiplayer feature since it is the only feature worth looking at.\n\nThe rules are very simple: roll a dice, move that many spaces, draw a card or cards, read them and d what the instruction tells you to do. Simple isn't it? Well, for developers it is not simple. The game is full of bugs and developers insist on working on new addons instead of correcting existing bugs. In other words - the game is not finished and really rushed and I need to point out it was released a long time ago. Too long for such issues to happen.\n\nThe game can freeze or crash just after loading it. I experienced game freeze on the main menu several times - solution, do not leave the game on the title screen or it will stop responding. You will be forced to start the game again and/or start Steam again, and/or reboot your system.\nThe game was not properly tested before release and it is more than obvious.\nA lot of cards do not work as they are supposed to. Many card effects lead to a dead end as you will not be able to do anything (I see that problem with many spells while casted on other players). Example: after casting for example, Misfortune spell on the opponent, the game stopped responding and did not give any player any opportunity to make their moves, the game stops, the timeout counter freezes and you or any other player is forced to leave the game in order to make it move on.\nConnection issues occur every game. Some players are kicked out of the server for no reason. Sometimes you cannot go back to the game you were playing.\nAfter joining the server and starting or looking for a game, your game can stop responding, forcing you to reboot your game and ocassionally your Steam and/or your system.\nWho put Quit button in the Settings? Standing ovation for the analysts/architects/developers and anyone responsible for this sensible chuckle design. I laughed, my friends laughed. Good comedy.\nThere is no way to speed up the game play. It goes very long and I played some games for such a long time that I do not recall any actual board games to last that long (and I played with 7 people at a time!). You have to wait for every action even if no action is available at the moment. For example: even though you have only one choice, the system does not automatically go with the only choice but waits for you to select it. Bad idea.\nThere is a number cards that do not work properly or do not work at all and when it comes tot he interaction betwen some cards, majority of such situations lead to a glitch, mostly forcing you to rejoin the game or restarting it.\nEach new addon comes with a new set of bugs. Beware.\nRandom Number Generator is really poor and developers should think before they do something rigged as this. There is a chance that you will throw "1" for about 5-10 times in a row which is impossible if you were really rolling dice. This NEEDS to be fixed. I remember rolling the same set of numbers several times in a row. Bad development. There is no explanation for such bad execution of dice roll simulation.\nYou can be kicked out of the game without any chance (yes!) for coming back. The game tends to bug out and nothing can be done to go back to it. Progress is lost. The most disappointing.\nInviting your Steam friends is very buggy. I have never successfully invited anyone without a crash, so I do not use that feature.\n\n\nTL;DR - If you want to play the great game which is Talisman - go and buy the original board game, you will never have to reboot anything, wait for anything to happen, look at bugs, being surprised that nothing what the card described happened. Digital edition is faw away from being a good product. It is fair for now, but it is closer and closer to being bad if noone takes care of basics like card working.\n\nLess development on new addons, more at bug fixing, please.\n\nI paid $1 for the game and that's how much it is worth\n\n\nPros:\n\n- Classic Talisman game!\n- Many addons and characters that make games more interesting\n- You do not need addons to actually play them, only one person in the game needs them\n- Very good music\n- The cards are taken straight from the board game version!\n\n\nCons:\n\n- The game is not finished\n- Bugs literally ruin the game experience\n- Connection issues that seem to go worse with time\n- No way to join the game that is currently in progress - in the board version that's what makes this game so attractive, no matter how many people are currently playing, you can always join\n- Bad mutliplayer and overall game issues force players to leave the game early (ruining the game)\n- Less and less players (20 average) playing the game online (which is very sad)\n\n\nDo not get me wrong = the game is fun but the way it was developed forces you to abandon the idea of playing. Board games are not supposed to be that frustrating when it comes to gameplay. This game would be better if not rushed so much. If developers concetrated on the Basis of the game instead of looking for easy cash selling characters or addons - I would recommend it 100%. Sadly, I cannot do that and reasons for it are mentioned above.\n\nThese issues are serious as I see less and less players online.","November 7, 2015","false","90.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

I hate that it's negative, but I am way too ticked off at this game NOT to give it a negative review. Second, this game makes me wish I had bought it AFTER the Stean refund policy change. I would refund this pile in a heartbeat. Now let me get into the things I hated about the game. Also, for the most part, you are not going to read anything here that are not in the other reviews. If you like the board game, you might like this if you don't crash. If not my gripes are similair to others\n\nSo, I bought this game a few months ago, but never got around to playing it. I left Neverwinter Nights, and get a pop-up saying if I buy a character for Talisman the profits with go to charity. Great! I love to help charity. And it is a shaman. Shamans and Druids are some of my favorite characters. So load up the game, and search the main page for a tutorial. There's none, which is troubling, but I figure, 'hey, it's probably a tutorial as you play kind of game'. Which it is. Problem is you ghave to choose your character with stats that you have NO CLUE what they do. So I do what I always do in a fantasy game where I'm not sure about the mechanics. I pick the Warrior, because it is almost aways the easiest class. I also make sure there is only one  opponent, because i wanted the make the game as easy as possiblee.\n\nThen I get into the game. My first turn I roll, get a 6 move to the temple. My whole strategy tois to get the two weapons that the fighter can have, then play from there. I roll again, then have to fight an ape. I lose. No prob. It's the beginning of the game, and I can't expect to win every dice roll. Now I don't remember all my opponents turns, (partly because he was taking turns when I was reading text) but basically he didn't have ONE bad thing happen on any of his turns. So, I take my thirds turn and fight a creature with craft, and lose again. Next turn, roll again, got a dragon, lost again. Now mind you, you don't get a choice on whether to fight or not. Some classes give some choice in some situations, but mostly, roll and get blssed or f-d. So, I'm down 3 lives, and have some event where I lose ANOTHER LIFE! My opponent. Again, my opponent has lost no life, and hasn't even had to fight. I am a WARRIOR and I have won no fights. I just want a weapon. So I spend my one gold to get back 1 hp because I am at one HP. THEN I get the second gold that would have allowed me to get a weapon.  Then I roll a demon which I would have to roll a 6 to tie. So back to 1 hp. At this point I say F this game. So I want to see what happens when you die, so I attack the creature with craft (magic) because he should have an advantage. And THEN I win. *Faceplam*\n\nAnyway I was done within 5 minutes of that. My opponent was already in the second ring. This game is JUST RANDOM LUCK. I own 600 on Steam, (though I've prob only played a little over 500 of them) and this will likely wind up on the bottom 50 of them.","June 10, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

However, the board game is, frankly, a bit flawed.  Talisman, in a nutshell, is: roll a die, 1,2,3 bad, 4,5,6 good.  Repeat. and repeat... and repeat... and... well, keep going for two hours.  If you like Talisman, then get this bit of nostagia (yes, there are new versions of Talisman out, but really, the first edition was the best fun).  I don't like all the add on packs for such a primitive game.  I also do not recomend multi player for this game (it deserves to be played on a table).

It's sort of a Candyland with violence. You get to make very few decisions during the game except when to roll again and when you use you spells.

Even if you enjoy this sort of thing, the game lasts way too long, especially the endgame, which can drag on forever even though it is pretty clear who is going to win.","January 10, 2015","false","4.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The actual board game is legendarily slow to play and these two games take the physical slowness out of the equation, but insert slowness and clunky controls where you feel like virtuality would lend itself to smoothness.\nSometimes you need to click the board to do a thing and the game will interpret your click as something else, and you'll mess up your turn. Sometimes the game's controls will screw you. All I can recommend is to be as careful as you can.\nIf you're a big fan of Talisman but you don't have friends who want to play the game on Steam with you, just buy the real board game.

The devs for this game had two jobs:\n\n1:  Design a AI for solo play.\n\n2:  Design a UI that allows players to play an already existing board game on the PC.\n\nThe devs failed so spectacularly at #2 that playing a game I loved became an exercise in frustration.  I am not exaggerating when I say that making this game a browser/mobile game would have been an improvement, as the developers would be forced to conform to standard UI conventions.\n\nFor example, nstead of Enter to accept prompts, the keybind is Space.. what?  Why can't I exit out of my active window with Escape?  Why does it always send me to the Main Menu?  And of course, I can't change the keybinds!  Borderless Windowed Mode?  Lol.  Run in higher resolution?  HAHAHAHA.\n\nWhen I say that the devs had two jobs, I mean it - all art assets are lifted from the board game in 2D format.  The Help function directs players to their site with a wonky search function.  Nothing like seeing format code while browsing the site with Firefox.  Real quality, that.  All of this makes enduring the awful UI especially galling.  I'm done with this game.","September 21, 2015","false","7.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The randomness makes it really hard to have control of the game and it can be infuriating to spend half an hour to try to move into a specific space that is necessary in order to move forward towards winning the game. Another thing to keep in mind is that a single game takes several hours to complete.\n\nThe game gets pretty dull already after one game and I really recommend that you invest in some DLC in order to make it more interesting. A good starting point is to buy the Highlands expansion and The Dungeon Expansion and if you want to live dangeroulsy: the Reaper expansion.  If you want to shorten the game length (and don't want to grind) it might be a good idea to buy the Runestone deck. I've never tried any of the DLC that modifies the victory condition, so keep that in mind if you listen to my recommendations.\n\nI've played the tabletop version of this game and have about 10 hours of in game time divided on two Steam accounts at the time of writing this review.\n\nNow to the implementation: the game is extremely buggy. You can play  a whole game without issues, but it gets really irritating when the bugs appear. All cards don't work as they should and during my last game we had to restart it twice because we were unable to do any actions. The AI is stupid and I don't recommend this game if you plan to play it alone offline.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? Although it's glitchy it's not unplayable. It's fun with the right people and it's an OK way to waste some time, but it's really not for everyone. So yes, if you are OK with all the downsides I stated I think that it's a good buy!","September 5, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

The game is very "simple" compared to the old Talisman version with all the expansions. (city, dungeon etc).  So its gets "boring" very quickly and limits "replayability".  I see great potential for this game and the initial beta purchase was well worth the money and time spent.","December 4, 2013","true","38.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Players can’t view the board spaces and the cards on it on another players turn.  And the AI (which can be played with in a multiplayer game to add players to the game) isn’t really competitive.

Talisman is a massive game in its "analog form" and with all of the expansions and four players, the setup is considerable and games can be marathons. But that's all good as boardgamers expect that. That said, Talisman Digital Edition fots nicely on my PC, requires mere minutes at most of setup an most importantly, captures the sheer fun of Talisman, Isn't that why we play games, for fun?\n\nA few negative reviews commented on the woeful AI. But, perhaps these folk are playing the prelude titled Talisman: Prologue. I have found the AI to be pretty good. And let's not forget that Talisman is largely a luck based game. All of the so-called tactics I have seen and heard about the game must still bow to the capriciousness of the deity known as RNG; even an AI like Deep Blue cannot predict the vagaries of dice rolls.\n\nThere are a few issues that linger. One of the most annoying is when an AI opponent draws an event card. Unless you are a speed reader or you know every Talisman card by rote - and with all of the expansions in the physical boardgame there is an insane number of cards, you won't have time to read what the event is. You have to zoom in on the board section where the event is. The same holds true for other non-spell cards. This has been brought up to the devs but as yet there has been no fix for this.\n\nThe digital version allows you to earn runes which grant advatages in gameplay. [AI also collects these as well]. I like the mechanic as it lends a sort of leveling up feeling.\n\nThe Dungeon Expansion is next up and I cannot wait for its release! If it is as faithful as the physical version of the game, it's going to be a blast.\n\nI think that Talisman Digital Edition is a wonderful introduction to the fun world of tabletop boardgaming and it scratches the itch of tabletop boardgamers who want to play without the crazy setup and rather forced solo variants for the physical game found round the interwebz.\n\nThis is a STEAL at the price and I would advise buyers to spend a little extra dosh and get The Reaper and Frostmarch expansions as they add considerably to the game.\n\nI hope that more boardgames experience a digital conversion. Are you listening Games Workshop and Fantasy Flight?\n\nEDIT: 18 November. The Dungeon expansion really ramps this game up considerably. The AI can be quite nasty and that's good as Talisman is a cut throat game.\n\nI am hopeful that the devs will release Blood Moon and The Dragon next. These two expansions literally change the game, adding a bit more unpredictability to a game that can punch you in the face already and have you smiling about it.\n\nUPDATE January 15: Ya gota love this developer. With the latest update there are two new free characters. These two are not even present in the physical boardgame but were last seen in the 1986(!) version of Talisman. More achievements plus what seems to be a hint that the Highland expansion is next! This is very cool as it is a one of the big corner expansions!!","July 1, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I immediately liked the game.  This Talisman: DE is a digital Board game, literally.  You play as a variety of classes trying to buff your stats and make it to the center of the board before anyone else gets there.  The game relies heavily on RNG type randomness, Most actions involve dice rolls, and most "encounters" rely on the way the deck is "shuffled".  Another thing to note, I don't know if I'm just unlucky, but this game is long, I have been in the same game for about 4 hours now. no one has come very close to winning yet. I don't know how long the average game against the ai lasts, but mine are always terribly long.\n\nOverall though I like the gameplay and art a lot. The art reminds me of classic Dungeons and Dragons art, and less grimdark games workshop art. I recommend this to anyone still interested after all that. I dont know  what kind of player will like it most really. If you get it, I hope you have fun!","April 3, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So much fun to level up your character, gaining strength and craft to fight enemies with. The object of the game is to reach "the crown of command" in the center of the board. However this is not so simple. You will have to go on different quests throughout the game to gain an object known as a "Talisman" to get the various places on the board. You will need one as you travel from the middle region of the board to the center region. However many things could happen between getting one and getting through to the center region. A player could fight you and kill you. A witch, bear or demon could spawn on you and destroy powerful or useful items you're carrying. The worst? Being turned into a toad. This is where all your items are dropped in the space you have turned into the toad. While playing as a toad, other players can pick up your items. It's a very challenging game and extremely time consuming. The 8 hours i have played.. 6 of them is just one full game of talisman, where unfortunately i did not win! I have the actual board game too and the digital version helped me learn it better as it gives you tutorials on your playthrough. Of course these can be turned off! If you are a fan of fantasy, board games and strategy then this one is definately for you! For what it is, i give it an 8/10. The game itself is excellent, but as i say you need a LOT of time spare if you're wanting to finish a game!","July 10, 2015","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I would reccommend this game to anyone who just wants to have a good time with friends, but if youre looking for good gameplay on your own... unless you really just want some nostalgia This game isn't for you.\n\nPros\n--------------\n-Good time waster with friends\n-nostalgic for you long time Talisman players\n-interesting interactions\n-you can laugh at the horrible AI\n\nCons\n--------------\n-Horribly buggy at times... many of which are game breaking (for example followers or spells that let you choose what your reroll will be will often reroll your second dice if you have 2 to choose from, or if you visit a shop and dont have enough money for an item the game just doesnt know what to do and breaks)\n-purely based on RNG very few times is decision making or skill going to win you the game because 90% of this game is pure luck unless you get some crazy powerful items from some of the expansions (cough cough clockwork owl) or if you get characters that can see the top of the deck like sage or spy.\n-kinda already stated as a pro but the AI is horrible, some might see that as a good thing because they can give you good items for bad ones or engage in battles they clearly cant win or dont use some items because they forget to... but otherwise its kinda stupid\n-DLC for the game can be pretty pricey, if you buy the game and all expansions (not including the standalone characters) currently available it will go for roughly $45 or you can make it $75 and buy the season pass which includes all current and future DLC except one that was sold for charity.\n\nTL;DR: The game is great to hang out with friends especially if you cant get together im person easily (or at all) But if you want everything its gonna be quite the money drop, the game is also horribly buggy and seems to lack some quality of life features like cancel buttons for most actions (shopping or spell casting for example) but if you can get past the bugs and horrible AI, then its a good time with your friends guarenteed!","February 23","true","44.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In it you will take a role of one of many adventures and embark on an adventure. Roll dice to move, pick a direction and deal with the consequences. Many characters have special powers that you can utilize in one way or another to make achieving your goals a bit quicker. Talisman came out a long time and as many old games it has it’s share of issues that modern board games have learned to deal with. However like old games it also has a big fan base.\nTalisman: Digital edition is for better or worse a faithful representation of the board game. But as digital board games go it is quite well done. You are able to save your progress without occupying a whole table. You can play with your friends that are spread across the globe. And you can play by yourself if you don’t have any friends to play it. If you buy season pass that gives you access to all the dlc, of which Talisman has many, it will save you quite a bit of shelf space as well.\nMost of the issues with Talisman: Digital edition come inherited from the board game. That means it can take forever to finish a game and is quite unbalanced and a lot depends on a roll of a die. Added to that are a few AI issues where computer controlled players can get stuck in a loop of selling and buying swords or make actions that are not quite optimal.\nDad rating: Fine\nYou can save only on your turn. But you can pause the game during computer opponent turn.\nSome of the art on some cards can be a bit scary but it’s always static images that you could see in a book or a board game.Talisman is not my favorite board game. But I do like board games and it’s good to see some of them cross over to PC world. With digital implementation of board games they usually fall short because playing with physical components is so much better. In Talisman: Digital edition a lot of the hassle of playing with real board game is removed and that’s why I recommend it.","February 15","true","58.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So much fun to level up your character, gaining strength and craft to fight enemies with. The object of the game is to reach "the crown of command" in the center of the board. However this is not so simple. You will have to go on different quests throughout the game to gain an object known as a "Talisman" to get the various places on the board. You will need one as you travel from the middle region of the board to the center region. However many things could happen between getting one and getting through to the center region. A player could fight you and kill you. A witch, bear or demon could spawn on you and destroy powerful or useful items you're carrying. The worst? Being turned into a toad. This is where all your items are dropped in the space you have turned into the toad. While playing as a toad, other players can pick up your items. It's a very challenging game and extremely time consuming. The 8 hours i have played.. 6 of them is just one full game of talisman, where unfortunately i did not win! I have the actual board game too and the digital version helped me learn it better as it gives you tutorials on your playthrough. Of course these can be turned off! If you are a fan of fantasy, board games and strategy then this one is definately for you! For what it is, i give it an 8/10. The game itself is excellent, but as i say you need a LOT of time spare if you're wanting to finish a game!","July 10, 2015","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This can be reduced by changing the game options.\n\nBe warned, this game contains:\n- My average game length is 1-2 hours, but it can be much longer.\n- Devastating random events. A single die roll MAY (and will) destroy you.\n- Horribly broken AI (which gives you a fighting chance of victory).\n- Waiting on AI turns (sometimes their turns are longer than your own).\n- Predetermined dice rolls (no restarting to cheat against the AI).\n- Lots of "Confirm" buttons when several could be replaced by having an "undo" button instead.\n- No "auto play" option for times when there is no choice involved.\n- Massive amounts of pay DLC.\n\nI recommend it, but its certainly not for everyone!","July 6, 2015","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also, change the setting to allow swapping out quests on the Warlock's Cave spot (it is disabled by default), otherwise you can get the quest to damage a character, and all the other characters are on the inner row, or at the Crown of Command, and you get to waste a half hour waiting for the dice rolls to kill you.\nThat being said, it was a fun game (albeit a bit long) but they give you the options to minimize some of the pain, and to at least give yourselves a quicker death than the long death the dice promise you.","October 25, 2015","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vartic/recommended/247000/","vartic","Vartic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vartic/","437 products in account","Amazing game!\n\nI got the game in July 2014 on a sweat -50% season pass. BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE! The amount of content added to this game is epic. I am a huge fan of randomness and replay ability and this game is perfect! No two games are alike and you have a lot of options to customize the speed and difficulty of the game.\n\nYou might not be a fan of dice games because too much luck is involved, honestly so am I! I rarely play dice games, but I feel that talisman has the perfect combination of luck-to-strategy ratio. I like to compare it to real life. In real life, no matter how cautious you are, no matter how safe your daily routine is, on a particularly unlucky day... you can die... at the prime of your life you can get hit by a car... you can go to the hospital for routine surgery and die on the table... Talisman is like that!\n\nOne minute you are the terror of the board, banishing demons and slaying dragons with the flick of your wand or tap of your sword, the next minute you are a cursed toad, powerless and vulnerable. The other night I lost a game after a series of 3 unlucky dice rolls, I was in the lead on stats, two turns away from winning the game, next turn I was dead. The odds of me dyeing there were 0.4%. I wasn't even mad, that was amazing!\n\nGood things can happen as well. One game I was the underdog, a lowly merchant, unskilled in combat, unwise in magic. After gathering a small pose consisting of a gnome, a guide and a faery; and armed with only a Talisman and a four leaf clover. I managed to pick the lock on the portal of power, brave the forgotten depths of the lost mines, escape a vampire's domain (RIP followers), then defeat four lesser demons in combat, cross the valley of fire and finally arrive at the crown of command. There, I obtained the power to command death as my servant and send him to kill my enemies one by one! All this was achieved with beginner level stats. I had no chance to win by overtaking my enemies the safe way so I risked it all, and this time I won.\n\nI have no problem finding games online to play with strangers. It's more fun to play with friends. I regularly buy copies of Talisman when it's on sale (usually 1-2 euro for the base game) and gift them. The good thing is that my friends don't need the expansions to play with me, because in a multiplayer game if one person has all the expansions then the game is played with all of them. In my experience games with 3 players are the best. With 4 or more the game tends to last longer. Two player games are also fine.\n\nThe rules of the game are easy on beginners. Even if it's a complex game, the rules come at you one at a time. You don't need to know what all the cards in the game do, because you will only draw one or two cards a turn usually and then just read those cards and see what happens! I remember when I first played Talisman, I had no idea what was happening... and that was great! I'm a dwarf in a fantasy world. I fight monsters, find treasure, and buy drinks at the tavern. My opponent is a troll who found a unicorn. The unicorn is smarter than he is...\n\nI could say a lot more about this game, it is simply amazing and lots of fun. It's well worth full price, if you are undecided, buy the base game on sale and play it online. You will not regret it!","July 3, 2014","true","107.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Thus I would've won.\nNo matter what I rolled i never landed on them.\nThey never rolled one bad die throughout the game. Not one!\nIn my knowledge of probbability, thats near impossible.\nIts certanly immprobable.\nSome people are gonna say I'm a sore loser.\nQuite the contrary.\nI lost several games in a row and enjoyed them all. Cuz it seemed random dice rolls werer been made.\nBut this last game seemed like a hack.\nI was determined to beat the hacker, but of course, thats impossible.\n\nAnyway, the game is great if you like board games. And if there is no cheaters.\nI recommend buy this if you are into fantasy games.\n\nI would love if they brought out hero quest the board game. Now that I would definitely buy\n\n","October 20, 2015","true","163.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
