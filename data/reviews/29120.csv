Not very good at all. But fascinating in a way. Obviously it's pandering to younger audiences with the stupid plot and stupid character design and abysmal dialogue. The gameplay ranges from "ooh that was a nice puzzle level" to "oh good another boring normal level". Yeah... they try to at least be a little creative with the levels but it gets repetitive, quick.\nThe game's music is endearingly bad, but also apparently a major selling point since at the end of each world you play a small easy rhythm game with the music you've heard for the past hour or so playing in the background. Usually the rhythm of the notes you need to click is off though!\nI don't know why this game is on steam to be honest but apparently it is, and surprisingly not the worst game I've ever played, probably because it's at least a little interesting in its badness. But yeah, don't buy this unless you get it from a bundle, definitely.","April 12, 2014","false","5.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Once in a life time you'll meet your perfect game, almost fate some might say.\n\nYumster 2: Around the World. A concept, a game, a work of art... A MASTERPIECE. Few words can explain this game, which Yaweh himself couldn't put together. Before Jesus Christ passed away from this cruel world and expunged our sins, some -if not many- historians say that his final words were "don't let the public know of... Yumsters".\n\nDating back all these years who would've thought that the greatest hidden experiment in all of the human race would be this game. It even dates back to the renaissance. Many a war was fought over the exisctence of this game, many a war was lost, countless lives, countless innocent men slaughtered, only so this game would remain a secret. Little did humanity know that it's greatest days were upon them. High debates are struck often over this games existence. Evil or good, great or trash, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or openminded, only time will tell.\n\n"lmfao this game is sick wtf yo" - Christopher Columbus 1770\n\nThis games history is much to deep and dark to discuss in a steam review. Ranging from the Pope to the President of Trinidad&Tobago this game is shrouded in mystery. Little is known about its creator or its founder but do not let that fool you. VOTED E3'S GAME OF THE MILLENIUM, it offers many of varieties to gameplay style, great graphics, highly resolutioned apples, realistic physics, outstanding soundtrack, excellent gameplay. To say the least... this game is perfect. To say the most? Impossible, for this game speaks for itself.\n\nYumsters 2: Around the World, a time-less game to be played and to be discussed for years to come.\n\nC A N C  E R","June 15, 2015","true","2.3"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","9","15","8","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theraintransformed/recommended/29120/","Theraintransformed","In-Game DOGG™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theraintransformed/","412 products in account","Yumsters 2: Around the World is the unofficial spiritual successor to Bad Rats.\nFeaturing a similar production quality and budget as Bad Rats, Yumsters 2 pulls no punches in providing the best that indie games have to offer.\nThe gameplay revolves around pulling brightly-coloured dinosaur worm things (Yumsters) across chains of fruits (at a blistering 60 FPS). They eat the fruits, and you get money for it. Later on, you use the Yum-money (the yummey) to purchase a generic albeit not racist musical instrument from whatever region of the world you're in (Egypt, Mexico, Japan etc) which you then use to play a rhythm minigame that rivals the depth and complexity of titles such as DmC: Devil May Cry and Michael Jackson: The Game. The intricate plot of Yumsters 2 is very well-paced, engrossing the player in a profound tale about brotherhood and personal growth as they advance from level to level.\nYumsters 2 offers a plethora of graphical options to make it perform well on all systems, such as "Fullscreen: on or off". The soundtrack of Yumsters 2 is also very prodigious, featuring a whopping three minutes of looping audio. Sometimes if you score a good enough Yumster combo (a yumbo), "Rules of Nature" will start playing, congratulating the player on their Yumsters skill. Yumsters 2's voice acting is top-notch. Captivating quotes such as "Commander ready" and "Tumma" (???) are delivered magnificently, rivalling the emotional and compelling narratives of titles like Metal Gear Solid.\n"Do you think fruits can bloom even on a battlefield?"\n"In the Middle East we don't hunt foxes, we hunt Yumsters."\nIf you liked Bad Rats, play this. Yumsters 2 may very well be the "Citizen Kane of video game".","October 23, 2013","true","1.5"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","10","17","2","2"

Once the worms harvested all the fruit, they can sell it and buy all kinds of cool stuff in the shop like guitars and whatnot. At one point they even start to make music, kids might enjoy their song but adults would probably stay away from their shenanigans.","March 19, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"
