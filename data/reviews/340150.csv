In Basement your aim is to create a successful drug empire by building facilities to produce drugs and taking over drug selling business to sell your product. But tread lightly, the larger your business grows the more attention you will attract from the police who will attempt to raid your facilities unless you 'persuade' them otherwise.\n\nI'm not in the meth business. I'm in the empire business.\n\nA word of warning, Basement, in its current stage, is more of a proof of concept than a game as most of the planned features are not present in the game yet. Despite the lack of content I, as a huge fan of Breaking Bad, enjoyed my time playing the game and look forward to seeing it develop. My review will be updated as and when this game is updated.\n\n+Awesome pixel-art style\n+Simple building mechanics, similar to XCOM or Smooth Operators\n+Four different types of drugs which can be produced using science, b**ch!\n+You can order your employees to attack the other businesses in the area and take control of them, you are the one who knocks\n+Your products are automatically collected from your base of operations to be delivered to your distributors\n+Taking over other facilities gets gradually more difficult as you get further away from your base of operations\n+The devs have set up a trello board so you can track their progress and they seem to be pretty active on the Steam forums, they're also very friendly\n+Good AI\n+Character descriptions are rather amusing\n+Nice soundtrack\n+Randomly generated cities\n\n-As mentioned there's not much to it, I won't mention everything and most of it can be discounted since it's Early Access but the main things are there's no tutorial so you have to learn for yourself and there's no objective other than make money\n-No way of speeding up time\n\nVerdict:\n8\n\nAn interesting strategy game with an awesome art style, simple mechanics and a good variety of products that is somewhat let down by its lack of content. If you're a fan of Breaking Bad this is not one to miss out on.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","May 6, 2015","true","2.3"," 143 of 168 people (85%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","85","143","168","27","5"

Nothing like waking up to the aroma of meth cooking in the morning!\n\nThe Good Fun. Hiding from cops while cooking up all sorts of nefarious product in underground labs is delightfully entertaining\nStraightforward UI. There's no tutorial (or at least not one that I found), but its pretty easy to just sit down and GO.\nGraphics / Artwork. It feels a bit dodgy and run down, almost like graffiti art people, which is appropriate considering the subject matter.\nThe minion AI isn't stupid. For the most part, it does precisely what it should be doing at a particular moment.\nCreepy music that I think works for a game like this\n\nThe Bad No save-game? Seriously? I realize that they're probably trying to prevent players from saving before raids and then loading if they fail, but what if I have conquered the sandbox and want to play again, but don't want to throw away my awesome conquest?\nSuper easy. I was able to beat it pretty-much the first time I picked it up. The strategy is very straightforward. If you don't have a line of junkies spilling out onto the street, and nobody dies, the police don't show up. Its all about managing that flow. Once its managed, the game becomes simple, and you can start training your conquest armies in peace.\nOverflowing money. Towards the endgame, you have too much money and nothing to buy. Part of this is because the money-stashes only hold $1000. When I beat the sandbox, there were whole houses that were nothing but money stashes because the game nags at you irritatingly every time you get money but have nowhere to put it.\nI am playing this during early access, so take these with a grain of salt, but there are some bugs. The delivery trucks didn't work for me. They would get to a place and stop and then never move again. The controls are also a bit finnicky when it comes to assigning workers to rooms.\n\nSuggestions Guns would be good. Considering the subject matter, I don't think devs need to worry about violence influencing children\nCompeting drug labs would also be good. It might be fun to try and get the cops to go after them, as well as bust up their operations yourself\nThere's no real difference in the drugs aside from market value. I would have liked some kind of tangential side effect, like Acid-takers tripping out and becoming erratic, pot smokers becoming mellow, speed users getting into more fights (etc)\nI think it would also be more fun if there were a bonus to providing a selection of substances, rather than really just wanting to provide the most expensive one.\n\nConclusionGood game already. I have high hopes for the final product being even better!  :)","November 1, 2015","true","3.3"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","49","54","3","0"

I can see the hard work the developers have put into it so far, so I have no trouble recommending it for people who are fine with bare bones gameplay that will be improved over time. The game satisfies an itch for me that I've had since watching breaking bad, a drug dealer simulation game.\n\nRight now, there isn't much to the game. You hire some drug makers(sorry, not sure what the proper term is), some bodyguards to protect your product from police, and you force dealers to deal out the type of drugs you're making. Thats pretty much it at the moment, you can build different types of drug labs, for Weed, Acid, dope, ect. You have to find dealers for each different type though, you can't just have one dealer that does everything. You also don't really have much control over the dealers(yet anyway).\n\nI won't go into too much detail, just that with the base game being what it is, I have enough confidence to recommend as I'm sure this game will be finished. It has enough to it to warrant the purchase now, and I'm sure there will be plenty of content updates to come.\n\nWait For Full Release","April 30, 2015","true","1.0"," 47 of 54 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","47","54","3","1"

Changable maps. when i mean Changable maps, i mean you can set the city to be small, lagre, hugs, med, etc. This would help keep the game last longer.Two, difficulty modes. Different difficulty modes would help the the pros at the game have a challanging and fun times, and help the new poeple have a bit of aneasier time. You could also set it to unlock differnt modes though playing the easier modes.Three, more ways to make money. As of in 0.24, there are only 4 buildings that can earn you money.

However, it also requires that you be attentive because it's also mundane and tenacious.  Being a drug-lord in this game you have to ensure that you have the proper amount of resources to assist your employees in thier daily tasks of creating and selling, and even defending/attacking.\nHowever, there is also some bad things such as the rollover(s) may not always reflect accuracy in the game.  This could cause frustration and negative gameplay experience as "mistakes" due to design impacts user experience(s).  Also, the "citizens" do not respawn after they're all killed, this lead to the downfall of my business within the game -- not just the citizens; thugs and policemen alike did not respawn whatsoever, therefore I was left with nothing else.  I haven't even taken 1/2 the buildings in the stage that was randomily spawned for me.\n\nOverall, the game is cool.  Great for casual play in its current stage.

Random spawning cities, a title screen, A SAVE FEATURE!!!, and new trucks.\nSome problems with 1.7 is the glitches. Some notable glitches:\n-The bus only shows 2 drugs when it should show 10 (But it does carry 10 still)\n-Sometimes any worker will keep resting even when they're fully healed and full productivity\n-The playtime still falls a bit short in my opinion, around an hour I think\n-No tutorial, although you can experiment rather easily\nThis update greatly helps to show us the game's core features and much more. One thing I want to see is different characters' appearances. For example, the cover of Basement shows a hazmat worker with a gas mask, PLEASE add this to some workers!\nAlso, I would like to see if an achievement and trading card system is implemented, please work on it :)\nOther than that, keep developing Basement, and I look forward to upcoming updates!\n\n\nVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV\nFirst release review\nVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV\n\nEarly Access Basement...\nI've been waiting for this game to come out for multiple months, and I was patient.\nTo my dismay, Basement doesn't have too much features and lacks game features- as noted when the game is stared. Quick list:\n\nGood\n-------\n-AWESOME soundtrack!\n-Great visuals with pixels\n-Great core gameplay/storyline\n-It fits a great Strategy/Simulation\n-First ever I know of "Drug Dealing Sim"\n\nBad\n-------\n-NO SAVE FEATURE! I played for a half hour to lose all my progress when I quit the game...\n-NO TUTORIAL! Luckily I watched a video on youtube of some gameplay so I know what to do...\n-Low content, short lived (You'll beat it in an hour or so, then you HAVE to restart)\n-No trading cards nor achievements\n\nAll in all, I think Basement has great potential to being a great game. Unfortunately, the small Halfbus team of I think 3 people can't make the game too quick. I recommend buying the game if you want to support Halfbus and get a general idea of what this game will become.

So for from what i am able to play I have enjoyed the game. And if the game lives up to the word of the devs and the expectations of the community i believe it is worth the investment. a solid 6/10 so far so give it a try. Bellow is my reason for the score.\n\nAlthough the game in in early development the foundations of what the game will be about are already there. You can tell it will be a fun game to try and over come the challenges of your neighborhood and create a nice drug empire. It has the elements you would expect at this stage including rooms to build people to recruit and police to fight.\n\nThe future of this game could be a great one as long as the devs don't neglect or give up on it and complete the game to a good standard.  Things that i would hope to be implemented in this game would be stating the obvious to people. But they include more enemy types, more rooms and vehicles. On top of this i would like to see skills for my employees and a larger leveling system. may increase 3 to 5 or 10 and level the gains per level but end on a high total.\n\nI have high hopes for this game and i have enjoyed the quick run play i gave it.

It's extremely bare bones, what with no menu, no tutorial, no tool tips, no save function, and no direction as to what it is you're actually supposed to do (you're creating and selling drugs, I think).  I figured some of it out eventually and actually like some of what it does...the whole base-building underground reminds me of XCOM a bit, albeit a simplified version.  If you're fine with a game that's missing a lot of core features and want to support the devs, then fine...though I personally recommend waiting for more content to see if the $9 is justified.

The game plays like a strategy game, therefore demands critical thinking and micromanagement. If you aren't any good at strategy games, I would still recommend you give it a shot. This is coming from a player who doesn't play any strategy games.\n\nThe game is still in development and has yet to reach it's full potential. At the moment I don't think there is enough replay capability to justify spending the 8 or 9 dollars.\n\nIf you do decide to pick this up now, my advice is to jump right into it. Trial by fire. Your first several attempts are going to be, more often than not, colossal failures. The game currently has no tips or suggestions for noobs. It actually reminded me of my first time playing Minecraft in that there were no clear instructions. But with a little perserverance, you will understand the innerworkings of the game.\n\nFinal thoughts: Put this game on your wishlist and keep an eye on it. I believe once this game rolls out more content and adresses its lack of replayability, it will find a nice place in both your heart and library.\n\nAnd remember, don't do drugs kids.","July 27, 2015","true","11.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

You have to build up your main facility to export different types of drugs to different stores that you take over by attacking them when you have enough men.\n\nIt is still a game very early in its developement, I myself have not come across any bugs so it seems to be a stble game to play and wont cause many problams. At the moment you are very limited with what you can interact with, build and do. You won't be able to play this more then a few hours at this stage but as the updates come out, this game will show more and more promise and I have no doubt it will become a game that you wont be able to put down after hours and hours. Until then you could see this version of the game as a short taste of what its like.\n\n","May 1, 2015","true","6.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

(That´s why it is an alpha :D).\nThe game is easy, you have like a drug factory and you need to produce and sell it so you can get money, with more money you can get more rooms, different drugs labor and yeah you can buy new workers. (You have two type of workers that you can buy, the drug producer and the "fighters"). The fighters take care of the police and they have more life and strength than the drug producers.\n\nYeah, so the things I think need to be made are:\n- that you can develop the transporters, so you can transport more drugs\n- that you can construct in any house/garage any room and that you can dig in any house/garage so you can build a room\n- that you can have partners, so like you have your region and you can work together with other regions/drug dealers\n- training room for the "fighters" and drug section training for the drug producers\n- police office and different types of police officers\n- that you just not can have partners but opponents too that want to get your region too\n\n\nand yeah, I think this would be what I would like to have in this game but even if it isn´t done, it makes even now really fun and yeah I hope that this project starts to develop to not just a good but an excellent game !","June 2, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It now has awesome challenges, as well as a better overall game experience. I love being able to upgrade your rooms now. It was a big problem before because one room couldn't sell things quickly enough. I also think that the main map is very cool for being able to see different missions.\n\nVERY OLD REVIEW(Early Release in May 2015)\nReally fun game I can see this being a entertaining game for hours on end. The only issue I have is that there should be a way to increase selling speed. Its almost impossible to gain any money past day 150 since you are being raided 24/7. This forces you to buy guards. The labor costs and hiring fee then become so expensive that its almost impossible to get out of the hole. Other than that its a fun game, you have to create a drug empire from your basement.\n\n\nTHE TIP IS WAY OUT OF DATE (Early Release in May 2015)\n\nA tip that might help you finnish the game like I did is to start bribing the cops once you have reached a steady income of money. Its almost always going to be worth more later to pay up then having to wait and buy new guards. The only time you should use guards is to attack new buildings. When attacking always make sure you have 1 or 2 extra guards to make sure they can get the job done. If you want to see a nice layout of your first base that can really help you later check my profile. It's in my opinion the most efficient layout that you can have. Always remember to start of with pot first don't jump to crack until you have tons of money to support the attack and support the bribes needed to keep the building.

It was very easy and I almost beat it in 2 hours but that is to be expected with a game this early in development. I found that i explained things badly at times and I found a few ai problems with the buyers, The cops were easy and the trucks were aggravating but it is a solid preview of the game. I would recommend it, but It could use a difficulty boost, more content, and tutorial.\n\nPersonal experiences.\n\nIt was very hard for me to get buyers into my new places, and these new places once you got into them tended to have small amounts of space to work with. So if you want a couple of groweries, or an atom lab good luck finding enough space for them. There are some later game buildings that are bigger but once you get to them you can just delete your security stations and get more space because you don't need guards anymore.\n\nI still think this is a good buy though despite its flaws because of the concept, fun( if somewhat tedious but never boring) gameplay, and with some updates this could be refined into something great","July 1, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game is a fantastic little way to spend 20 minutes on and then do something else, but more often than not you will end up sinking even more time into the game than you planned.\nI reccomend this game 100% and look forward to seeing more and more features get added, a list of things I hope the developers consider for the future are;\n- Random Spawns, I believe this will allow for more diverse gameplay.\n- A heirarchy system that allows simple dealers to be promoted and eventually become integral members of the 'crew'\n- More Enemies to deal with such as Rival gangs\n- Some customisation to your front, such as disguising your business as a Bar and dealing drugs from it in the back rooms.\n- Bribes paid to the Police buy their protection for a certain time.\n\nA quick summary, I can't reccomend this game enough an extremely enjoyable title with amazing artstyles and addictive gameplay.","June 29, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I didn't look how far it is into development. It wasn't far. Of course you are able to play, but just remember how few things you needed to play as you were a children.\nIf you try hard enough you can spend hours into the hundreds on every task and call it 'fun'.\n\nOnce again I fooled myself with the Early Access - tag. "How long can it take to develop this simple 2D game?" - I said to myself July 2015. Now 2016. Some things have changed, how shall I deny that? Do I have the feeling that they worked a reasoned amount of time on it? No. For me, it is another StarForge.\n\nIf you've read till this point, you'd kinda expect that I leave some sentences on the gameplay. It's kind of you get what you see. You build rooms for certain tasks. Workers are needed in some of those. If you are behind in production, a junkie will attack you which usually results that the police will check on you. More space is aquiered via attacking buildings, which revolves around sending workers and watch them punch other guys.\nOnce again, you can spend on everything time. But I honestly never got the feeling, that i've experienced anything new nor had I a need to change something after building my first base. Everytime it was the same.\n\n","May 2","false","5.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

But with just a few additions, you could make this game 666/10\nI love the mechanics of the game, and i cant get enough if it. I know that you will read my comment. I know that you dont get to all of the comments. But if you get to just a few key suggestions, you could makea five star game. I think personally that the game only needs two things. One, the game lacks actual missions. If there were more missions, or a story mode, then people would play the game nonstop. I understand that there are only a few of you making this game, so you should get a team. If you want to make more improvements faster, you need a team of skilled developers and this game will b ready in no time. The other idea i have, multiplayer. Not multiplayer like minecraft or dayz, but basement multiplayer. Where as you have "your basement" and others have "their basement". there could be different objectives such as bank heists or a time limit.

I know that you dont get to all of the comments. But if you get to just a few key suggestions, you could makea five star game. I think personally that the game only needs two things. One, the game lacks actual missions. If there were more missions, or a story mode, then people would play the game nonstop. I understand that there are only a few of you making this game, so you should get a team. If you want to make more improvements faster, you need a team of skilled developers and this game will b ready in no time. The other idea i have, multiplayer. Not multiplayer like minecraft or dayz, but basement multiplayer. Where as you have "your basement" and others have "their basement". there could be different objectives such as bank heists or a time limit. Some servers could have objectives, or some could just be multiple players raiding eachother and whoever captures all of the basements wins.

As of the current release, you play an unnamed scientist with the aim of bringing the entire city/urban area/whatever it is under your control. The game is bare bones right now, and goes something like this:\n\n- Build new drug labs/security checkpoints.\n- Hire new chemists/henchmen.\n- Send henchmen to neighboring buildings to take them over: be prepared to send two or three truckloads, as they tend to die in rather short order.\n- Send henchmen back to previously conquered locations to fight off police raids (or bribe them if you're making money hand over fist)\n- Take over every building on the map; you win!\n\nThe game is lacking in content at the moment - my playtime represents a single game start to finish, with the only replay value being in the randomly generated maps. You have a very small selection of room choices and no upgrades or real variety for your chemists and henchmen (beyond very small stat changes that are tied in to the hiring cost/upkeep of them). On the plus side, the developers seem on the ball with patches and rolling out content, so this should be remedied sooner rather than later.\n\nHowever, I can't recommend it at this time - I think more than a few people would be disappointed by the lack of content for the price. If you want to support the developers, buy it, play it for a bit, and shelve it until you start seeing updates. If you're on the fence, or just know that you'd rather purchase it in a more complete state - just put it on your wishlist and come back in three months.","May 16, 2015","false","7.6"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","11","25","0","0"

I'm sorry, I don't feel like getting into details. Just wanted to get it out.\n\nUPDATE\nok since i wrote this in the comments, just copy-pasting it on here.\n\nThis game is probably the game that I was most hyped for ever since it's day 1 on greenlight. One of the most turn-offs for me was it was a horizantal scroll game. And I always expected the gameplay to be tycoon-like. I expected to manage my operations like if I was managing a company. And I thought I would be able to buy weapons, fight other druglords, upgrade and research drugs, enlarge rooms, create branches in different cities, find ways to smuggle drugs to other places, buy items like untracable phones or planes. More in-depth. The visual art outside the game is awesome,but the ingame 2d graphics could have looked cooler.

I finished it in about 1h30min and have to say it is way too easy and it misses some management issues and customization. For example you have a district with some people where you can sell but you cant build a dealer place because it wont let you. The garage offers you multiple vehicles to buy but you honestly only need the scooter. All in all I expected a management kind of challenge but the game let me down in this matter. I will play it once again just to see if I only got lucky but so far I give this game 4/10 and would suggest to wait for it being completed.","July 2, 2015","false","2.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

I hope the developer adds more rooms, more things to sell, and makes the products more unique. The game seems to lack "end game" content, i.e., what is there left to do when you take control and can successfully defend from cops? There should be some high end facilities you can get.\n\nTwo things I would suggest:\n\nThere should be bonuses for good room placement. What I mean by that is, say, if you have two storage rooms next to each other, they should connect and be able to hold slightly more. If you have two grow boxes next to each other, maybe they could connect and make a hydroponics lab, which means the production rate gets +.2 or something like that. I think this would make designing your buildings much more interesting. Maybe larger rooms could require a little more power to balance it out?\n\nAnd a more major thing: The game needs to be more forgiving in the beginning. For example, I spent 15 minutes sloooowly expanding so I didn't draw the immediate attention of cops, and then my dealer had to take a break. He came back and got murdered by an angry customer. There was literally nothing I could do about this, because my dealer spawned with low health.\n\nAnyway, the game is playable, but not quite enjoyable yet. I'll come look again in a couple months perhaps.\n\np.s. This game is a little more suggestion centered than review centered, but A. this is in early access and the dev needs feedback and B. theres so little content that you've played the entire game if you've watched the trailer.","August 14, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

I had seen this game in steam greenlight a long time ago and thought it would be cool when it got released, and I just found it, released! I bought it immediately. I would regret it if it wasn't early access. The reason it wasn't good was because once you got to a certain level, you were basically done. You are done 30 minutes into the game, because by then you can have the best room in the game. There needs to be more rooms, types of buildings, men, etc. There needs to be more challenges. I had 10 very good security guards built up, and I am starting to swipe through the district. I just attacked the hardest building with no problem.

The game currently lacks anyform of play outside of a (very limited) sandbox mode, with no tutorial or story mode to introduce concepts and gameplay. It is a shame that a developer thinks this model of aselling to players a game in it's uncompleted, and frankly unplayable state, is not only allowed, but widely supported.","July 9, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

I have no problem spending money on indie games and infact I prefer it over buying AAA titles. I also Realize this is still a super early version of the game. But my honest opinion is that in the games current state it is not worth the money. There is less than a hour of content. No Replayablity. Until the game gets a substantial update keep it on your wish list. At the time of the review I have 79 Minutes played, and the game crashed once and i had to restart. From then on I fumbled though trying to figure out what to do because there is no tutorial, no instructions, nothing. After all that I Still beat it first try no problem.\n\nLuckily there is an easy fix, Don't force the game to end after you beat it. I took over the last outpost and was looking forward to just selling drugs and preventing future raids but your only option is to just restart and do the exact same thing you did.\n\nI really enjoy the game but there is not enough content at this time.

There are multiple room types and a good supply chain, and your "employees" (both chemists and thugs) require to rest or they won't work as effective. Combat is a simple dungeon keeper style of throw the most/toughest of your dudes at their dudes and they automatically fight until the other side falls over, your units can level up too (one of my original chemists could take down a riot officer). To be clear this is a skeleton but a damn fine skeleton, I beat it in 90 minutes and am waiting eagerly for future updates.

I was extremely surprised by Basement. I love the game play, so simple it is perfect. I am looking at you Europa Universalis. I enjoy the fact that when I higher employees, I can see a mini bio of their life. Also, the deep thumping music even solidifies the fact that you are making drugs and there is always a threat of cops catching you. I was presently surprised when I saw I could change screen resolution, sound volume, and music volume in the same menu. Some of the Early Access games I have played do not have these settings, or they are buried in pages after pages of settings. The fact that you can bribe cops helps a massive ton early in the game. All of this being said, I found the game extremely easy. I beat the game the first time after about an hour.  I could just spam guards to protect my starting area. I wish there were more difficulty settings. I would like to see a game mode where you have to fight the cops and another drug manufacturer.  Also, some of the buildings I have taken over from the cops, cannot have a basement to expand the building. Some of the buildings that do have basements cannot be expanded because, there are empty rooms with brick walls that cannot be used for anything.\n\nPros:\nSimple game play\nEmployee bios\nKoolio Music\nVideo, sound, and music settings\nBribing cops\n\nCons:\nExtremely easy\nOnly one difficulty\nSome buildings cannot be expanded\nBrick walled rooms cannot be used\n","May 17, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thus making it unnecisarily hard level up your bodyguards. Personally I would have implemented these features from the start before it even got green lit cuz they are pretty critical for gameplay.

I was extremely surprised by Basement. I love the game play, so simple it is perfect. I am looking at you Europa Universalis. I enjoy the fact that when I higher employees, I can see a mini bio of their life. Also, the deep thumping music even solidifies the fact that you are making drugs and there is always a threat of cops catching you. I was presently surprised when I saw I could change screen resolution, sound volume, and music volume in the same menu. Some of the Early Access games I have played do not have these settings, or they are buried in pages after pages of settings. The fact that you can bribe cops helps a massive ton early in the game. All of this being said, I found the game extremely easy. I beat the game the first time after about an hour.  I could just spam guards to protect my starting area. I wish there were more difficulty settings. I would like to see a game mode where you have to fight the cops and another drug manufacturer.  Also, some of the buildings I have taken over from the cops, cannot have a basement to expand the building. Some of the buildings that do have basements cannot be expanded because, there are empty rooms with brick walls that cannot be used for anything.\n\nPros:\nSimple game play\nEmployee bios\nKoolio Music\nVideo, sound, and music settings\nBribing cops\n\nCons:\nExtremely easy\nOnly one difficulty\nSome buildings cannot be expanded\nBrick walled rooms cannot be used\n","May 17, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I have noticed a few bugs and come up with some minor shortcomings (seeing as this is alpha though they are 100% forgivable):\n\n-Occasionally the games UI will crash, and what you can see will dissappear, however it is still possible to hear sounds and even click buttons. If this happens to other people it would be great if you could fix it :). So far with my small amount of gameplay it has happened a fair bit, but I have not found any other bugs.\n\nI think that it would be cool too if you could make it so that you can expand your 'business' overseas... like once you have a certain amount of property (or not) you can send your Adolfo and some of his mates over to some other place -off the map, in a different country maybe- and then start off your specialist plant growing bussiness over there too, and slowly expand until you have a global empire of Rare Foods. That's just what I think though, to try and make the game last a little longer, if that's not the direction you wanted then I completely understand, and it will probably in the far future if it ever does end up happening.\n\n\nSorry for the long post, thanks for reading.\n(I have no potatoes)","August 14, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would absolutely recommend getting this game because I believe that it has a lot of potential to be a blockbuster game that will be on the top of the Steam charts. However, there are some quirks in the game that I'm going to point out here. (I am aware that this game is in alpha right now, but leaving honest opinions helps the creator)\n\nSometimes when the drug is being created, the cook will freeze and the progress bar won't go up any higher. To fix this issue, just click on the cook and click on a nearby couch to send them away to rest. This fixes the issue for the time being.\n\nAnother thing that's pretty annoying (no fix) is that there are random frowny faces hiding behind the buildings that never seem to disappear. I'm not sure if anyone else is getting this issue or if it's just me.\n\nFinally, I'd like to see a larger map that lasts longer than just 120 minutes of playtime. (That's what I'm at right now) I'm sure the creator will add more content to the game as time goes on, so I'm excited to see what's next for this amazing 8-bit game.  Something that would make this larger map more interesting is more frequent police raids when you have more power & more types of drug manufacturing.\n\nMy honest opinion is that this is a must-have game. Whether you're a hardcore gamer or a casual gamer, you'll have amazing experiences with this game! :)","July 2, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are multiple room types and a good supply chain, and your "employees" (both chemists and thugs) require to rest or they won't work as effective. Combat is a simple dungeon keeper style of throw the most/toughest of your dudes at their dudes and they automatically fight until the other side falls over, your units can level up too (one of my original chemists could take down a riot officer). To be clear this is a skeleton but a damn fine skeleton, I beat it in 90 minutes and am waiting eagerly for future updates. Highly recommended but is by no means a complete game.","May 10, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not Alpha. Not Beta. Not even a conventional state of "early access".\n\nAs the disclaimer at the start of the game says, it represents the absolute core mechanics of the game, and doesn't even have a title screen or save-game functionality.\n\nThat being said, it's actually pretty good. Though all of the mechanics are barebones and not particularly tied together at this stage (for example, click a room, hire a chemist, he'll show up at your Main District but won't automatically go to work in that room), but it's a good concept and a very good start.\n\nA word of warning though: This is not a base builder game. It is not an RTS game. It is not open world. It is not Evil Genius or Prison Architect. It is very much a resource management game. You have limited space, limited vans, limited expansion locations. Everything costs something, and when you lose that thing, you have to pay (or fight) to get it back.\n\nFrom what the devs have been saying, it looks like the final game will veer a little closer to being a base builder, but more in the XCOM: Enemy Unknown style.\n\nWhich is actually a pretty accurate summation, as it stands: It's XCOM for drugs.","May 11, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was extremely surprised by Basement. I love the game play, so simple it is perfect. I am looking at you Europa Universalis. I enjoy the fact that when I higher employees, I can see a mini bio of their life. Also, the deep thumping music even solidifies the fact that you are making drugs and there is always a threat of cops catching you. I was presently surprised when I saw I could change screen resolution, sound volume, and music volume in the same menu. Some of the Early Access games I have played do not have these settings, or they are buried in pages after pages of settings. The fact that you can bribe cops helps a massive ton early in the game. All of this being said, I found the game extremely easy. I beat the game the first time after about an hour.  I could just spam guards to protect my starting area. I wish there were more difficulty settings. I would like to see a game mode where you have to fight the cops and another drug manufacturer.  Also, some of the buildings I have taken over from the cops, cannot have a basement to expand the building.

I felt great figuring it out, but electric usage, profit dropping, managing units, over a expedited 24 hours, and being raided while learning controls might not work for everyone. But its fun when you figure it out. I noticed everything listed from the previous update except "New trucks." I thought it meant new as in additional. The ice cream truck is still funny. The biggest issue I had is a glitch. After taking half the map by capturing a large chemical district I realized I had almost no money. I had three trucks in possession but none of them were moving, leaving me with barely full storage rooms. My chemists looked like they were working, using their energy, but weren't producing anything. Like the update says, I had a dealer and producer in the same district, so this could be a similar problem. Great game so far with interesting mechanics. Looking forward to the final version.","May 21, 2015","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some things that concern me and i would like to see different in my point of view and oppinion. Firstly the police raids are far to frequent i feel i dont have enough time to move the guards around and buy more. Secondly i would love to see more unlockables more places to go to more houses and sellers and also more vehicles. Also of course im sure it will happen but be able to upgrade everything where things can be upgraded to be faster and produce more. But apart from that this game being early access is a great game and a great way to kill time and relax. I wil continue to play more of this game cause its fun to play.","May 13, 2015","true","35.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very fun to play, definitely worth $9.99 even though it is still in Pre-Alpha. This game will be a hit when it is released in six to eight months. Great gameplay for the Pre-Alpha version, however I hope that they will soon add the ability to move your employees to different districts and most importantly, to have the option to save. This is the only downside of buying the game at its current state, although it is still worth it.

This game is amazing. It isn't perfect, but most games aren't. This game is for you if you love tycoon games and selling drugs to random homeless men and women, which actually kind of makes the game sound boring, but believe me it isn't. I give this game an 8/10 and here is why:\n\n\nPros:\n\n-The game simply has an amazing concept which I enjoy and find sometimes comedic which is to sell drugs. Simple, but I love that about it. It isn't complicated and takes almost no time to get a hang of, but I love it.\n\n-Good looking game. It has good graphics and I do understand it is a pixel game but it just looks nice. It is appealing to the eye which makes it easier to binge on for a few hours.\n\n-Still being updated. They update the game and I only got the game today but to my understanding they update it either often or in big updates at a time, since the game is rather new and has still changed a lot since it came out. I finished the game and I cant wait to play it again when they add new exciting things to do.\n\n-Casual. It isn't a very difficult game to play and is kind of relaxing when you get into it... Well as relaxing as a drug cooking and dealing game can be...\n\n-Replayability. It is decently replayable. I am not going to replay the game 50 more times and waste 100 hours of my life on it (at least not until they update it again) but still decently replayable.\n\n\nCons\n\n-Repetative. Even though it is replayable, after a few run throughs, I'd imagine that it would become very repetative, which is why I hope they continue to update the game.\n\n-Short. It does not take very long to beat the game especially if you tried. I kind of messed around a bit and still beat the game in less then 2 hours. If I really tried I could do it in less then 1.5 hours.\n\n-Easy. Yes I did say it was casual but I really hope they add maybe a difficulty option or some way to make it more of a challenge after beating the game the first time. I beat it once and now I want to beat it again, but I want it to be harder then the first time and give me a good run for my money.\n\n-No content. It is in early access which is why there is less content then a full fledged game would and should have but it is also most likely cheaper then the game will be in the future and is almost an investment in a game in hopes it will become even better.\n\n\nOverall, great game. It needs some work but it is early access so don't get it and immediatelly refund it because wait a week or two and they will already have some new stuff to try out. I actually found out about this game from a youtube video by Sips and I decided to get the game. If you are uncomfortable getting an early access game then don't. If you are unsure remember that you will be getting an unfinished game but you will also be supporting the developers and speeding up progress at the same time. I hope everyone who gets the game enjoys it like I did and it now eagerly waiting for the next update.","June 30, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This increases your revenue, enabling you to acquire new buildings and expand your empire further, but also makes your business more prone to police raids.\n\nBuying transport to transport goods between premises is an option provided you have a garage, providing further depth to your manufacturing and distribution network, and forcing you to think about designating premises to perform particular functions: manufacture, distribution, storage etc.\n\nEach character in the game has a set of stats which indicates things attributes such as: health, damage, ability to sell drugs, ability to manufacture etc. which level up over time as the attribute is used. This enables you to specialise your employees in order to maximise their effectiveness at their given tasks.\n\nAesthetically the game's pixel graphics are well-done and quite charming in their presentation.\nThe minimal soundtrack compliments the atmosphere and immersion the chosen pixel art style affords, and I look forward to future updates that expand out the content even further.\n\nAt the moment the game is currently only a sandbox mode, but the developer has mentioned future updates will also include other traditional game modes.\n\nShould you buy the game now in its current state, you will get something that is currently playable, but will also be contributing to its further enhancement which is en exciting prospect given how fun it already is.\n\nLets just hope the updates keep coming :)","October 3, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"

I usually don't play early access games because of the way starbound was. The game has a good concept. It's very entertaining. One idea for the full version would be a campaign mode. Where you can choose from three different guys or a few different guys. And instead of one city, have maybe 5. So your drug company has to take over all the cities. Also adding in storyline in that mode would make it awesome. Even though the game's only in early access it is very fun, I would recommend this game.

Suffice to say, I'm no fan of this game.\n\nI get early access can sometimes be buggy, but this feels pre-alpha. The interface is reminiscent of a badly written dos game from the 90s. There's always an element of doubt that you're going to achieve your intended goal whenever you click on anything.  The graphics are atrocious, but I've got no complaint about that. Graphics do not equal gameplay and gameplay is where this title is let down and solely what I'm basing my review on.\n\nThe $8.99 pricetag suggests that a massive amount of extra content will be added, so the developers are going to be pushing it if they're going to stick to their stated development timeframe. If that happens, I might change my opinion. I won't be holding my breath.\n\nSometimes it's better to keep your masterpiece hidden from view until it is ready to reveal to the world. It is my opinion that the developers of this game would have been wise to follow that advice.","November 1, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I felt great figuring it out, but electric usage, profit dropping, managing units, over a expedited 24 hours, and being raided while learning controls might not work for everyone. But its fun when you figure it out. I noticed everything listed from the previous update except "New trucks." I thought it meant new as in additional. The ice cream truck is still funny. The biggest issue I had is a glitch. After taking half the map by capturing a large chemical district I realized I had almost no money. I had three trucks in possession but none of them were moving, leaving me with barely full storage rooms. My chemists looked like they were working, using their energy, but weren't producing anything. Like the update says, I had a dealer and producer in the same district, so this could be a similar problem. Great game so far with interesting mechanics.

Then since you can't pay the bribe, you have to fight, and since you don't have money, it's hard getting enough bodyguards to deal with piggies and shield-guys.\nNever the less, I will keep playing, in hope the devs will work hard on this","May 26, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I have noticed a few bugs and come up with some minor shortcomings (seeing as this is alpha though they are 100% forgivable):\n\n-Occasionally the games UI will crash, and what you can see will dissappear, however it is still possible to hear sounds and even click buttons. If this happens to other people it would be great if you could fix it :). So far with my small amount of gameplay it has happened a fair bit, but I have not found any other bugs.\n\nI think that it would be cool too if you could make it so that you can expand your 'business' overseas... like once you have a certain amount of property (or not) you can send your Adolfo and some of his mates over to some other place -off the map, in a different country maybe- and then start off your specialist plant growing bussiness over there too, and slowly expand until you have a global empire of Rare Foods. That's just what I think though, to try and make the game last a little longer, if that's not the direction you wanted then I completely understand, and it will probably in the far future if it ever does end up happening.\n\n\nSorry for the long post, thanks for reading.\n(I have no potatoes)","August 14, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would absolutely recommend getting this game because I believe that it has a lot of potential to be a blockbuster game that will be on the top of the Steam charts. However, there are some quirks in the game that I'm going to point out here. (I am aware that this game is in alpha right now, but leaving honest opinions helps the creator)\n\nSometimes when the drug is being created, the cook will freeze and the progress bar won't go up any higher. To fix this issue, just click on the cook and click on a nearby couch to send them away to rest. This fixes the issue for the time being.\n\nAnother thing that's pretty annoying (no fix) is that there are random frowny faces hiding behind the buildings that never seem to disappear. I'm not sure if anyone else is getting this issue or if it's just me.\n\nFinally, I'd like to see a larger map that lasts longer than just 120 minutes of playtime. (That's what I'm at right now) I'm sure the creator will add more content to the game as time goes on, so I'm excited to see what's next for this amazing 8-bit game.  Something that would make this larger map more interesting is more frequent police raids when you have more power & more types of drug manufacturing.\n\nMy honest opinion is that this is a must-have game.

The devs put their roadmap up for public access, listen to feedback carefully, and respond rapidly to bug reports.  They're iterating rapidly and seem likely to hit their announced release date; a somewhat rare event in the world of early access.

PERFORMANCE AND / OR CONTENT MAY BE DIFFERENT!\nIt all starts out basic like it should, you begin with a Growbox for gowing weed.\nyou have a seller, a guard and a cooker.\nLet's explain what each class does.\nThe seller sells the drugs that your cooker has made and has stored in the tiny storage that the cooker puts them in, the weed comes at a price of 150$ the acid at 170$ the mushrooms at 180 - 200$ and the cocain at ­∼ 200\n\nThe guard guards you (obviulsy) and you can use them to take over other buildings (I'll get into that later don't worry)\n\nAnd the cooker the most important guy you'll ever have, he cooks..... and that's it there's nothing else to him.\n\nLet's get into the police part.\nThere are in every building in the game exept in the basement that you start in.\nand they guard that specific house for the rest of the game unless you raid them and take the house over.\nyou can do that by clicking on the fist button (no dirty pun intended)\nand if your guards and other guys that you send there win, then you get the building and you can then put stuff like generators in there and acid stalls and etc.\n\nthere's not much else to it right now when it's in this state but, I'm certain there will be more in the future.\n\nI hope there will be a tutorial and cutscenes and some story and I would LOVE to see some more drug stands for this game! Anyways, I'm impressed how much there is to do in this game at this state!\nIf you have good waiting skills and a clever mind you can beat this game!\nI give this game my rating ooooff... 8.5/10 It naturally has some bugs as every game has, but that doesn't stop it from being a good game!\nget it if you have the money.","July 13, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have not played much of it but what i have seen is great. Really fun, a must get in my book. Yes it is early access so there are places to be improved on. There is a small part in the game that does happen to get to me a little. When you go into sadbox mode there is no end result as you expect as it is sandbox. so there is no way of getting back to your map. You have to start over again (unless i am totaly missing a way of returning to your map.) Other then this small thing i have fallen inlove with this game.

When I first downloaded it I thought it would be a bit boring but the mechanics are very entertaining and fun. You can never play the same level exactly the same way. There is always a bit of randomness and surprise whether it is the police or random junkies becoming angry. The style of this game is also very nice. All the elements are well designed and you can tell the creators at Halfbus really do love this game as much as me. There are a few minor bugs as to be expected with an early access game. I really hope the developers continue on with this game and add more features. This game is simply a Breaking Bad simulator where you control your empire. You are in charge of your rise and downfall.

The pixel art is polished and well themed, and the gameplay is interesting and satisfying.\n\nMy only suggestions are these:\n- More help. I got to level 3 and I'm lost as how to gain customers. I'm sure I will figure it out and that's satisfying in itself, there's nothing wrong with a game teaching you how to play by actually playing the game. I don't need someone to hold my hand, I think I just need a few extra clues.\n- Grammar. I know it's early access and some things are probably put in there quickly or as placeholders. It just needs a tidy-up and it will be great.\n\nI am so excited to see this game finished.
