Plus, it's very easy to get back into favor with them if you make a mistake with one of the ones you like.\nIt is disappointing that the narration assumes your character is inherantly moral at times, sometimes I want to play as evil! It does warrent a few replays because of the different pathways. Overall, it's cute, the characters don't make me feel murderous and the mysteries are fun.","December 21, 2015","true","2.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I don't consider this game to be worth the money spent when some of their other games give you about as much satisfaction while being free. The "romance" and daing mentioned in the description, ended up being a few paragraphs at the end of the game before it abruptly ends at a cliffhanger, and I just sat there wondering where the rest of my game was. It felt like the developers just ran out of ideas and decided to just end the story there. If there were more content added and the game didnt just end in the middle of the dance, I might change my mind about this game.","December 21, 2015","false","1.2"," 31 of 53 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","31","53","0","8"

But there are few things I am not happy with. Firstly the length is quite short in my opinion and the idea is vaguely similar to Psy High, another product of COG, altough the setting is quite different. Loved the attempt of solving myteries but I could not feel any real impact of the investigations. The consequences felt as very minor.\n\nThe game takes one case to another quite abruptly and doesnt give time to adjust ourselves. It could have been expanded between cases for more character development and approach to cases more naturally.It is like one minute you reading conclusion to one case then boom next chapter you chatting with someone else then comes next case. Maybe thats how mystery novels are written but I am not comfortable with it.\n\nPlus sides are the writing were short and good. Doesn't lose me half way through the page. A good one but with some minor flaws. Get it if you want to be school detective. But there are better COG products with better value for money.\n\n7/10 In game and review, I did not lie\nbut my pants been on fire since I was five.\nThank you for making me Honest Abe for a while.","December 21, 2015","true","1.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Characters are very well written and i absolutely loved the choices you get to pick, they are actual things kids most likely will say. I really enjoyed this choose your own adventure game and will urge anyone who is into these types of games to give it a try.","January 6","true","4.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You will be study (a little), have fun with friends and classmates (more often) and solve mysteries (a lot). The world and people around you are easygoing, characters are pretty realistic and fun and even if you’ll make some mistake, you always can fix it and that encourage you to actually playing the way you like it, not just “make everything perfect and everyone happy” way. Mysteries are not that difficult, you can easy solve it, if you’re fan of children’s or adult detective books and quest’s games (most certainly even without these traits), still they’re nice and interesting and have a spirit of all these detective books.\nAnd, yes, my favorite game’s part, besides solving mysteries, is characters. There’re really quite diverse cast: rebel kid, cute girl, nerd girl, smart boy and creative boy – each with their own personality and interests. Chatting and spending time with them are really fun, it’s like you back in your childhood, but without bullies, bad teachers and homework! And if you nice enough, you’ll see pretty cute teen romance. And have a date. And a dance.\nStill you should know that the game is a short one (you can finish it in two hours) and there not so much replayability as you might hope for. For me it’s not a big deal – the atmosphere and the story are good and that’s what I looking for.\nSo, yeah, I highly recommend game for fans of children’s detective books\movies\comics\etc. It’s really nice and you’ll have a good time.","February 17","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I played it and this doesn't give the best story line. It's just a story that you read and choose different answers to come with a different outcome. So I suppose if you have nothing to do and you are really bored you can play this in one sitting. Otherwise, I would choose a different game. Try the game "Who's Your Daddy?" or "The Stanley Parable". Now those are games worth the money.","January 9","false","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The author perfectly crafted a deep web of intrigue and conspiracy that will surely take scholars decades to untangle and solve.

With enough achievements to spur you on to collect them all and several different characters to investigate, it is good fun. My only criticism is that no matter how you play the game, it doesn't change the plot all that much, so the level of replayability isn't great.

I got so crazy after that clifhanger came about in the end where the dance is. I expected that the dance story would be longer because not all of the clues were answered. For one I got though my first playthough with 1 lie. 1 LIE! But thats not the fact. I get about the ending but would like another part to this story of the dance at least. I mean the crown goes missing and all I do is roll up my sleeves. Sounds like I'm going to find the person but ends right there. Overall the game was made to be great. I love it and others would love it too. Keep up the good work and I would love the cliffhanger wouldn't leave me off of one. I mean someone stole the crown! Enough ranting over how it is.

Even though the graphics are functional at best, being mainly text, I felt really involved in the game - it was well paced and well written.  Although it gives you the choice to play as a boy or a girl, there are a few points in which you can tell it's written with a girl character in mind (I don't think any boy's Dad calls him 'sweetie'), but for the most part I think all the choices of ways to play allow for plenty of replay value.  The main improvement I'd like to see is a choice of a different colour scheme - staring at black text on a white screen for over an hour was quite tiring on my eyes!","January 4","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
