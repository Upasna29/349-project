Exhibiting an exceptionally basic premise that offers less content than free flash games, Winged Knights: Penetration is literally what you see is what you get. Not even enough content for a Demo, the Developers still have the unmitigated gall to charge money for this travesty. Do yourself and the rest of the world a favor and spend your money on a Development team that is actually interested in producing enjoyable content. You will be making the world a better place by not purchasing this pathetic excuse of an offering.\n\nSee my full critique here:\nhttps://youtu.be/ov4kc6oWqMs","May 27","false","0.9"," 43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","43","45","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mellow_Online1/recommended/473620/","Mellow_Online1","Mellow_Online1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mellow_Online1/","195 products in account","This game was originally covered in a live stream I did with The Annoying Atheist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=983tcAz_etA\n\nOut of all of the games Digital Homicide have made, this is the most broing, most uninspiring, most useless and most unneccessary game that they've made (that's saying a lot cause all of their games are unneccessary are unwanted.)\n\nWhen the game starts up, there's no sign of the 2nd player. The 2nd player doesn't show up until the 1st player dies and u restart the game. Also, I was never able to figure out the controls fr the second player. There aren't any prompts saying how to control him. The only control I got fr the second play was that Rctrl made him fly.\n\nWhile I'm on the topic of controls, the controls are awful for this game. You move the knight with A & D but you need to tap B to make im fly and, while still tapping B you need to move him around with A & D. That is a real pain.\n\nI didn't believe for one moment anything in this game belonged in the same place. Here's what you have:\n\n1) Knights on horses with m=wings that majestically fly, while knights have their spears out\n2) A hell/demonic bacground\n3) Some sort of cropped google image of some sort of metal as means of the surface your knights move around on\n\nHalf of the screen was also missing, meaning it didn't show the 2nd player's score.\n\nThe horses animations also seemed to keep on playing at inappropriate moments (standing in place)\n\nThis is a terrible game, even by Digital Homicide standards\n\nPros\n+ You can b*tch and complain about the game with somebody else while you play\n\nCons\n- Bugs\n- Nothing belonged where it was\n- Terrible controls\n- Boring\n- Missing prts of display\n\nFinal verdict: 1/10\n\nMy Steam curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","May 27","false","0.1"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","31","37","2","0"

Intersting things:\n\nFirst, you *must* take a screenshot for Player 2 to start the game. Next, the enemies continue to spawn, regardless of how many died prior-- levels ending and respawning on what appears to be a timer, rather than anything you, as the player, have done.\n\nThis cannot be intended operation, yet there it is.\n\nAdditionally, DigiHom has decided that they will not be monitoring their forums in what appears to be a fit of pique. This is the one game from the current crop of their Greenlights that is NOT a direct project-flip, and it's horrifyingly broken.","May 28","false","0.1"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"

Is the game supposed to be a bad rip-off of Mario Battle and Super Smash Bros. Melee? Where's the character selection screen? Where are the powerups?\n\nAside from flying your unicorn and empaling your opponents there is not much to do. In fact, the game features only one map and doesn't even have a main menu!\n\nTo kill your braincells like I did click on the link below and admire the horror :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx2p6zraqrU\n\nRating :\n1.0\n\nPS.

In reality, this game is absolute garbage.  The original post rated the game positively and consisted of the following:\n\nWhile many individuals claim that this game is sub-par in terms of graphics and gameplay, I disagree.  This game provides hours of fun for all ages and there are many helpful features in the game.  I shall now present a list of pros and cons regarding Penetration.\n\nPros:\n- Fast-paced, entertaining gameplay\n- Interesting points system\n- Fun colors\n- Game only has one stage: a really interesting cave\n- You can have less than 0 lives, which is handy\n- Sometimes you die for no reason, providing a fun challenge for more experienced players\n- Peaceful, calming soundtrack\n- Handy guide in corner: "CONTROLS A D AND B"\n- Horse\n\nCons:\n- No yellow steeds\n- Has "Penetration" in the title\n- May cause diarrhea, blocked sinuses, hernias, and thoughts of suicide.  Please contact your doctor if any of these occur.","May 27","false","0.4"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","19","29","7","6"
