Engrish abounds (e.g. "I must help me get to home"). Gameplay is nothing new, you click on stuff so you can click on more stuff, then click on something else. The time management portion is iffy. I never really felt stressed out about the time limits and some of the earlier levels are much harder than the later ones. Once you figure out the basic "engine" and how to build it with your starting material on every level, it can feel like more of a chore then the other farm frenzy games. If, like me, you like winding down with casual cow clicking, pick this up on sale. Laugh at the awful translation and take it for what it is - shovelware of the highest degree. That said, it takes about 25 hours to complete (gold star on all levels), so it's actually pretty good value.\n\nThe Farm Frenzy Franchise (ooo alliteration!) doesn't really set a lofty standard of gameplay, but this one fails completely. I won't be buying others in the series after this.","June 10, 2014","false","25.6"," 83 of 105 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","83","105","2","3"

There's nothing casual about the gameplay. Each mission is timed (1 to 2 minutes), giving you little time to look around. Tasks just involves clicking in a series of areas to produce a certain final product. Bonus items also requires that you look around the scene and find it. Obstacles (like moles) try to impede your progress. The only way to get rid of them is, you guessed it, click on it.\n\nI was looking for a sandbox mode but can't find the option. I originally hoped this game would be some sort of cartoony sim farm, but all missions are timed leaving you little time to actually enjoy the game.\n\nWouldn't recommend this game.","July 15, 2014","false","8.2"," 50 of 70 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","50","70","0","0"

If you liked the ones that came before it, and don't bother reading anything, you might enjoy it, as it adds a couple of new mechanics in, but I was left feeling pretty disappointed.","May 15, 2014","false","0.8"," 36 of 53 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","36","53","0","1"

Don't even look at strategy tag, it's just casual in full meaning of that word. If you're hard-core gamer, don't even try it. I think of myself as a hard-core gamer, but sometimes I like to play something easy and that's why I tried this one. So was that game a good experience? I can't say I played it a lot, but to be honest I just couldn't. This game is just terribly borring for me. But on the other hand I know there are many players out there which love such games.\nSo why I marked thumb up? Because it worked well both on my PC and on my Win 8 tablet. You can play using only touchscreen and there are not too many such games on Steam.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you are 100% casual player, you may love it. Especially it you want to play on tablet.\nBut if you're not a casual player, better find something different. Even if you have tablet.\n\nLike this review?

However, Farm Frenzy 4 was a pleasant surprise. Yes, basically it's the same old Farm Frenzy inside, but it does not fail to entertain you every second of the time spent playing. Lush colors, 3D, camera control - it's all pretty nice, maybe it's a matter of taste, but I liked the visuals. Music is great as well, all the rustic Country and Celtic themes somehow sound fresh and don't irritate you after hours of playing. Storyline with its mysterious take is rather good for this type of games, too.\n\nBut what really surprised me and made the game stand out of the similar farming clickers, is the attention to details and its constant aspiration to keep you occupied. I love having so much to do to find things while you're playing to up the money multiplier (I like the multiplier idea a lot. Sometimes I found my focus elsewhere rather than on my goals which created a real challenge) and the way you catch the bears is cool. All that quirky little perks like collecting things to trade them for bonuses, and animal combos leave no time to be idling about, either on levels or between them. The only complaint I'd like to voice is that it would be nice to have a little more detailed instructions on the collection items. And yes, maybe it's too easy sometimes - if you only pay attention to the primary objectives, getting the gold most of the time does not present a significant challenge. But when you've figured out the level strategy, previous Farm Frenzy got boring, and here, the fun only starts - you can hunt bears and moles, catch butterflies, collect apples and whatnot. Your mouse never rests at peace, and that feels good.\n\nOverall, it's not the same old same old Farm Frenzy from yesteryear, but that's perfectly fine. Definitely recommend.","July 6, 2014","true","17.1"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","20","35","0","0"

FF4 is a surprisingly addictive game. I am used to buying and playing high-budget AAA games and playing a "casual" game like FF4 is a different experience for me.\n\nI was introduced to "time-management" games recently and I am enjoying this genre because it requires a bit of fast-paced thinking, not just clicking.  FF4 can get a little hectic and it takes a while to get through the entire campaign. It is very difficult to collect all the Steam Achievements due to how many rounds there are in the entire campaign.\n\nAs many reviewers have noted, the broken English in the game used is pretty bad. It is a bit distracting if you are trying to immerse yourself in this game.  How hard can it be to find one American editor to clean up the broken English?\n\nThe sound effects are good and functional. The cartoony graphics works for this game.  Again, my biggest criticism is the poor English being used. I am not a grammar Nazi, I simply object to what appears to be laziness on the developer's part to find someone who knows conversational English to edit the text.\n\nAside from that quibble, I have no regrets getting FF4. As usual, I wait for a 66%-75% sale before I buy as to minimize the risk of paying money for a bad game. Yes, I know Steam does refunds but with all the games I have and available today, I am simply not into paying full retail price for most games.\n\nFF4 is a cute but challenging time-management/strategy game.  Don't let the cutesy graphics fool you. It does require some strategy to get through to the very end. I highly recommend FF4.\n","September 7, 2015","true","76.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

They were great to start out with, fun cartoony graphics, fast-paced play and challenging levels.  Then they got really hard but still enjoyable (All the FF3 varients). Then came the latest ones, FF:Hurricane Season and their ilk - really a blast to play and not too hard but still a bit of a challenge.\nWith FF4 I don't know what the heck happened!  The graphics are awful, the animals barely even move around, the machines are not upgradable, the cat meows incessantly and the game play is SLOOOOOOOW.  The story is disjointed and the main character looks nothing like the original character.   It's like the developers lost any ability to program the basic things they had been doing before.  Are they trying to make the animals more realistic?  Well they look unformed or something.  I sure wish they had left well enough alone.  Oh well, I am still going to play it and I guess I'll recommend it if you can get it really cheap (about $2 or so), but it's sad that the franchise has gone so far down hill.","January 1","true","16.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

This one is just as great and addictive as the rest. It's a great game to pass the time with. I bought this during the Autumn sale for really cheap! It was well worth it.\n\nIt definitely is challenging when trying to beat the clock on all the levels. But still fun just to play even if you don't quite make the goal time. It just makes you want to try and beat the clock even harder the next time around! For me at least.\n\nI would definitely recommend it for anyone who likes a challenge and a time passer type of game.","December 2, 2015","true","22.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has never functioned properly. As of January 21, 2016, it does not function properly on Windows 10 (even [especially] when trying to use compatibility).  It acts as if it is a free trial...first hour free and then only 5 minutes at a time after first free hour.  I am currently in contact with Alawar and am awaiting a response.  I am not the only person having this problem.  Since I paid such a miniscule amount for it, I am willing to wait to see if Alawar/Steam can fix the glitch.  If I had paid more, I would have gotten a refund.\n\nThe time I spent on this game is misleading.  60 minutes the first time with several 5 minute sessions, trying different fixes (compatibility mode, turning off Steam overlay, clearing cache/brower/regedit, moving game to different location on PC [outside of the programs section], ... everything suggested on different sites).  Nothing has worked and compatibility modes shut the game down totally.\n\nThe game for the first 60 minutes was ok.  I miss the original Farm Frenzys.  This is not the same...cheaper quality, I believe.  Just like sequels to movies, they are banking that people will buy it because the first ones were good.","January 21","false","36.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
