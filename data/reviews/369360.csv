The game could have actually been pretty fun if the game was sped up a bit, allowed you to see when a side is finished so you didn't just sit there waiting for a few seconds hoping it was done.\n\nFor what it's worth it could have been a decent title especially for the time of when it originally came out but it falls short massively with the pacing and other big issues.\n\nWhile I don't reccommend it It's not to say you won't have fun with it if you can get past the slow paced nature and lack of content early on but definitely don't pick it up for Â£3.99, get it in a bundle or on sale. But first Try the Demo to see if this sort of game is your thing.\n\nI give the game a 5/10 for being somewhat unique and a different experience but lacking in content and too slow paced.\n\n[[Update]]\n\nOkay upon further inspection it appears you can skip ahead and then the game really begins, not much however changes apart from being able to clean cars faster, still no indication which is a big issue.\n\nEven with this speed upgrade the game is still so tedius and boring, after finishing the first Non Tutorial mission I was greeted with a new piece of Gear, ANOTHER piece of cleaning equipment which operates the same exact way, circle the car until it's done. Brilliant.\n\nHonestly playing the game more makes me want to drop the rating more because It's even worse, by trying to add more 'gameplay' to the game it actually does the complete opposite because it makes you do the same thing more and more and doing the same boring task is not fun. It literally adds nothing new to the game.\n\nIf I were to drop it it would now be a 3/10.","March 16","false","0.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

This does not effect my review.Summer break, a time to relax and have fun. But what's the difference between a good summer and a great summer? Spending money, of course! And what better way to earn some extra cash than a car wash? Unfortunately, the local branch of Ninja Car Washing Corp. is right across the street and they donâ€™t appreciate the competition...\n\nCommentsI am going to say this right away: I would only highly advise buying this game on sale. Otherwise, it's up to you.\n\nGameplay is not as polished as it should be; slow and sometimes tedious\n\nThis game is orginally from 2010, and it shows age\n\nThe idea behind this game is great: just trying to earn some cash, you end up fighting against a rival car wash across the street that is owned by ninjas who constantly try and sabotage your customers with mud filled balloons. It is your job to fend off the balloons with your hose; all while washing cars and trying to keep your customers satisfied.\nSummaryGraphics: 5.\nLooks like it was made in paint, or with a very generic program. Still looks decent.\n\nMusic: 6.\nNothing much here, just a few moderately catchy soundtracks on loops. Fitting, but lacking at the same time.\n\nCinematics: 5.\nAlso done with paint or a similar program. Not bad looking, but could be better.\n\nStory: 7.\nAs was mentioned earlier, the story revolves around a young boy determined to earn money. He ends up as the target of the ninja car wash accross the street.\n\nContent: 6.\nCouple hours of gameplay for those who do not mind the graphics and have some patience.\n\nControls: 6.\nHard to get used to at first. WASD to position around the car your are washing, Q and E to switch between tools (Hose, sponge, ect.) and arrow keys to aim the tool currently selected.\n\nGameplay: 5.\nVery slow at almost all times, takes patience. If slow gameplay bothers you, you may want to look elsewhere.\nTL:DRA game that shows age with somewhat under average graphics and soundtrack, solid story, controls that take getting used to, and slow gameplay at times.\nUnfortunately, I can only recommended to buy this game on sale. 6/10 at best.","November 8, 2015","false","3.8"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","1"

This goes painfully slow, and you have literally no idea how much is left of what side (does it even matter, I guess it does). So I got $12 when he closes shop at 5PM (3 of the cars). There are still 4 cars waiting, and the clock gets stuck at 5PM for me to wash them. Is there a point to that, will I fail anyway? Will I succeed anyway? I don't know, I didn't stick around to wash 4 more cars like those last 3.\n\nI mean, if only you could tell which of the 4 sides you still have to do I guess it could be fun, but now it's just guessing and tedious waiting and hoping for the best (which wont happen obviously).\nSo now to farm cards and uninstall :(\n\nShame, the albeit crappy drawings were fun to watch, but wont see them past day 2 :/\n\nEDIT: Just watching the video (the only one) and day 2 requires $70 there and cars give $8? Actually the biggest difference is washing cars seems about 40x faster than it is for me.

Better spend all your days washing cars for loose change instead of enjoying the summer.  If that wasn't depressing enough evil insecure Ninjas will try to stop this mud hole business from getting any customers.\n\nThe lack of player feedback makes cleaning cars a bland experience where progress is uncertain.  Walk around the car while adjusting your facing to wash them.  The occasional ninja attack break up the flow but only slightly.  All this while a single music sample loops forever.","March 18","false","2.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
