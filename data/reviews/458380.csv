(10-30 hour category on VNDB but it personally took me 20 and I consider myself a fast reader.) I purchased this back in December when it came out on Mangagamers website. This steam version is uncut and retains all the original scenes. This VN has a very slice of life episodic feel to it, going from chapter to chapter covering the two main characters dealing with different people in the steampunk themed academy. The narration has a very 'prosey' feel to it.\n\nIf you don't feel like you're enjoying the VN by the time you get to the first swap to Teslas perspective (With the dog) this is probably not the VN for you as I had been sold on it by then.","April 15","true","0.2"," 134 of 152 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","134","152","5","5"

It is fairly long and contains great artwork and voice acting. It has a lot of Slice-of-Life scenes and chunni elements.\nThe characters are very interesting and fun, especially the main 2 characters, Neon and Tesla.\nThe story happens in an Academia, which is a huge city-school, run by the students themselves. Neon, the protagonist, is a first year student in the school, and Tesla is the transfer student who just arrived and will attempt to take down the governing council and save the 100,000 student.\n\nPros -\n- Great artwork.\n- Great soundtrack. (though it is a bit small)\n- Great characters.\n- Really good voice acting.\n- A very well built and interesting world.\n- The writing style is really good and pretty unique. Personally, I love it.\n- The translation quality is really high.\n\nCons -\n- Some of the fight scenes can get a bit repetitive.\n- Some of the charactes sadly do not get enough screen time and feel underdeveloped.\n- There are some pacing issues.\n\nOverall, Gahkthun is a great visual novel. It has good story, writing, art, voices and music. It's high quality, and definitly worth it. I give it 8.5/10","April 16","true","2.1"," 99 of 111 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","99","111","3","0"

In terms of story and choice, this game is basically a kinetic novel with bad ends and one true ending. Getting the true end is relatively easy and the game itself should take roughly 10-15 hours depending on how fast you read and how much of a completionist you want to be. While the length certainly can't match with Grisaia and G-senjou despite being in the same price tier, this game does have a more focused central plot with a builty in encyclopedia!\n\nThe main character is Nikola Tesla who transfers into the class of the female protagonist and proclaims that he will save them this time around. The plot contains a steam-punk setting, mecha battles, a healthy amount of sex and a quasi love-triangle. Art-style is reminiscent of the other Liar Soft games with sharp faces and slim/tall bodies. Music is top-notch along with a couple notable seiyuu's in the cast.\n\nIf you like quality VN's and want to support the fledging industry on Steam then definitely give it a buy.","April 27","true","6.2"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","2"
