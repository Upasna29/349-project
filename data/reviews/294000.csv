Bought it while i was there for half price. Currently does not support online play but it does support local co-op play and is a blast and makes a great party game. Even at its current state i recommend the game. They are still updating so be on the look out for the online play soon.","January 25, 2015","true","2.3"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","23","27","2","0"

I first tried this at PAX Prime 2015, and ended up revisiting the booth the whole weekend to keep playing.\n\nThe ideal way to play this really is with 7 friends locally, although the computers aren't awful to play against. It's already incredibly polished for local play, and the developers have said they're working on making the online functional, although I personally haven't tried it yet.\n\nThere's a ridiculous amount of content for the price, and once you play it with friends once you won't regret it. It creates a lot of the same moments I remember playing 4-player bomberman on the snes. Tense, interesting, and fast-paced multiplayer couch combat. I probably should have started with that, but oh well.\n\nSeriously, get this game.","September 13, 2015","true","4.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/criticalcomposer/recommended/294000/","criticalcomposer","CriticalComposer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/criticalcomposer/","980 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nKnight Squad was probably designed with the idea, "What if Gauntlet had online multiplayer?" While the game modes consist of your standard fare deathmatch, capture the flag, king of the hill, etc the real heart of the game is in its gameplay and mechanics. Players begin with a short sword but, through Bomberman styled pickups, upgrade to long swords, bow and arrows, kamakazi bombs, and crossbows. One hit kills but respawns are quick creating a fast paced feel to the game that suits it well. The only fault with the current build is that all matches will be played with AI bots. Online multiplayer and a campaign are on the way though so this issue will eventually be rectified.\n\nOn the other hand the best part about this game, thus far, is the inclusion of local mulitplayer. With the industry standard of making games without local multiplayer, this is a breath of fresh air. Playing this with a few friends reminded me of all of the great times I had playing 2v2 Smash Bros. Might I say that this is no small feat to accomplish. I still hold Smash Bros to be the best party game for local multiplayer. In fact, both games feature "fun chaos" when first learning the systems and both have a great deal of depth/strategy despite both having appeal to non core games.\n\nI am eager to see what Chainsawsome Games does with the future of this title. Whatever they do with it, though, it is off to a great start.\n\n","May 28, 2014","true","3.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","17","20","2","0"

As soon as the game launches I will have a final release review which would be a much more descriptive review. Thanks!\n\nKnight Squad is a 1 to 8 player indie game created and published by Chainsawesome Games. It is available on Steam's Early Access program for the low price of $9.99. The game puts you in the point of view of bird's eye view and allows you to control one out of eight knights. You will control your knight to defeat all other opponents that stand in your way. As the player, you may choose one of the six game modes, each mode having two maps (with the exclusion of Soccer's one map). On top of picking a game mode and a unique map, made exclusively to a certain game mode, you can choose whether you would like bots to play with you, if you are alone. You may set the bots to have a certain difficulty out of the four choices (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extreme). With whatever mode you choose, whether it's easy or even extreme, you will be challenged as the AI is very well programmed to fight you. How does it hold up?\n\nKnight Squad surprised me. I haven't had this fun playing with my brother and six other bots in years. The AI challenged us to even use teamwork when we were on the same side. With all the powerups and weapons that are thrown at you from enemies, you're gonna need to move quickly to avoid arrows, lasers, and even KAMIKAZES! The list goes on for a while, including ninjas - which fight by your side as you fight enemies - and even being able to drill your way through the map's blocks. You will have a lot of fun with this game, especially as more maps and gamemodes are being added. And, like every review has said so far, I can't wait to kick some butt on online multiplayer!\n\n8.5/10 - Knight Squad is already rivaling some of the best multiplayer games that have come up within the past 5 years, and it's only going to keep getting better! Well done Chainsawesome Games!","June 9, 2014","true","5.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","13","18","2","0"

It brings the nostalgia of old 80s arcade games such as Pac-Man and Gauntlet, but mixes it up with slightly better graphics and sound. It lives up to the fast-paced action and multi-player fun that once soothed the savage beast 20+ years ago. Featuring multiple game modes and challenges that can easily fit into your busy schedule, you can crack some skulls and chop up some centipede beasts within minutes and still make it to work on time! How many games can you possibly play that allow you to quickly play a few short rounds, blow off steam, and still have fun before you're off to take care of responsibilities? Not many.\nThe soundtrack is perfectly fitting with the swords and sorcery gameplay, sounding as epic as the hack-slash adventure itself. Play against friends, enemies, and random opponents and beat your highest score over and over again! Survive and long as you can and destroy as many beasts and knights as you can to claim you are the greatest knight in all of... well, whatever kingdom you may lay claim to when you're sitting in front of your PC busting heads with your keyboard or gamepad. If you have 5 minutes to spare, a yearn to capture some hills, and are willing to give nostalgia a chance then download Knight Squad and let's play.","December 9, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There IS an online multiplayer mode, but it's empty most of the time. Also can there be a way that me and my friend can play on the same computer?

This is one of the few couch games you can play locally with 8 friends and have a blast.  If you have the controllers and the setup, this is the game to play.  It's similiar to Bomberman but with tons of team battles and various modes.  Played this game at PAX and just played it 5 hours straight last night with some buds.  Well worth your money!","January 3","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty good game when you've got a few controllers and friends to play with, though not so great when playing alone.  I suppose online multiplayer would be ok but still not as fun as doing it with friends.\n\nThis may be playable on keyboard, but I wouldn't recommend doing so.","May 22","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I absolutely love the game modes, characters and challenges of this game, but none of my friends have it. I wish more people I knew had this game, its a very fun over-head view game like the legend of zelda, it has a variety of characters weapons and gamemodes, very fun single player challenges at various difficulties, and a sense of exploration to some maps that have drills and certain blocks that can be drilled through, making your way through the map for the various objectives. Many good gamemodes (My personal favorite is juggernaught) Like capture the grail, capture the flag (team), jailbreak, deathmatch, gladiator, and much much more. Overall its just a plain good game! With power-ups and weapons such as the lightning staff, the ripper, speed boots, horses, shields, boomerangs, bombs, and SO much more than that! with varieties of knights like from Savior, to Selfie, this game just never stops being good. Good to play with friends, and I highly recommend playing with a controller, because its harder to aim with the keyboard. If you try it with the controller, and then go back to a keyboard- you would want to go back to the controller. Knight Squad is a highly good game. I really recommend a lot of people to try it.","March 3","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Challeneges are unfair- trial and error type. Controller is a must, do not even think about using keyboard. You get different colored knights but waste of potential there - they could have used some RPG elements to those knights.\nTry it if you get it on bundle like i did otherwise stay away from it. You get 4/8 card drops and other 4 you can buy for under 25 cents.","May 30","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Keyboard controls are terrile but controller is good online community is noexistant though as only a few people on at one time. The dlc is also quite good as it has 4 new game modes which nicely sink into the feel for the game without making you feel like you need them and if one person has the dlc and goes online everyone in that game can play the map but cannont choose the 3 new characters.","June 4","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
