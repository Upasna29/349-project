I bet not. And you  probably also never heard of ZanZarah, an obscure German game about a teenage girl visiting a land of fairies. What these things have in common? Well, everything.\n\nIn ZanZarah you play as Amy, who goes from London to a magical land of fairies, elves and wonder. This enchanted world is threatened by an ancient evil, your arrival was foretold by a prophecy and all that. Your quest here is to explore the land, help the locals and raise a strong party of fairies to save the world. To recruit new magical creatures, you must first weaken one in combat and then capture it with a special ball. Sounds very familiar, no?\n\nAnd it doesn’t stop there. ZanZarah offers over 70 magical creatures – including animals, dragons and demons – spread into 12 types: Fire, Water, Nature, Air, Stone, Ice, Chaos, Energy, Psi, Metal, Dark and Light.\n\nTheir attacks have the classic effective/noneffective relationships, and in true Pokémon fashion you also get to choose your initial fairy between three types. They even evolve after reaching a certain level.\n\nBut here’s the big twist: unlike Pokémon, you won’t battle in turn-based combat, but rather in FPS arenas with elaborate layouts, firing magic blasts at enemies while strafing, dodging and flying!\n\nThere are no guns, but each fairy can equip up to four different spells – two offensive and two passive. The game features 120 spells with a wide range of effects, damage, fire rate and mana pool. Spells must be charged before firing – some allow for quick bursts, others are very slow – but charge too much and it will backfire. All of this keeps battles interesting, as you’ll have to figure out the best loadout to use depending on the arena layout or the enemy type you face.\n\nTo crown everything, the soundtrack is excellent. Composed by King Einstein, the battle music is exciting, the exploration music is charming and the main theme is a beautiful melody sang by Karina Gretere.\n\nThe only real downside - and this will be a deal breaker for some - is that even this new 2015 Steam re-release doesn't run well on modern computers. You'll occasionally get some visual glithces and graphic artifacts, but the worst part is that the game drops to like 5fps when you open a menu, no matter how powerful your PC is.\n\nIf you can deal with this, give ZanZarah a try. If not, don't even bother.","August 21, 2015","true","2.0"," 126 of 133 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","126","133","2","3"

I have fond memories of playing this back when it originally came out, and as you can see from the other reviews, its basically fairy themed third person pokemon with first person 'creature' fights.\n\nI played this out back in the day, and would love to play it out again.\n\nI cannot, however, recommend this game.\n\nWhy you ask? Because it ran better on my 1998 Compaq Presario, than my current 8 grand worth of hardware. And I doubt it will ever be fixed, owing to the company that made it going out of business in the mid 2000's, and recently being bought out (in name only) by Nordic Games.\n\nWhat does this mean for us gamers? Simply that they can release old content (and earn a bit of dough off us sappy sentimental folks) without ever having to commit to fixing the obvious flaws that causes the game to slow to painfully slow fps any time any box of dialog or menu opens over the main screen.\n\nI'm sure a small investment would fix this, and I eagerly await it happening, however I must also resign myself to the fact that it probably won't.\n\nIf you want to purchase this out of sentimentality, go right ahead. Otherwise, leave it alone until it's fixed, and don't tarnish your opinion of what is actually quite a great game.","August 23, 2015","false","0.2"," 144 of 192 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","144","192","5","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dianaangel/recommended/384570/","dianaangel","Deilin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dianaangel/","229 products in account","Old school, comparativly to many other game on the market, and it shows, but was also one of the first games I bought after buying my first computer, so it holds sentimental value to me. I was so sad when my computer died, and my new one wouldn't play the CD-ROM (which I still have).\n\nBut that's not why you're reading this.\n\nYou play as Amy (or whatever you name her). From what the origional player book implies, she's the a-typical loner heroine. She gets runed away to a mystical land where she must cure the faeries that have been poluted. How do you accomplish this, by capturing the feries with orbs after battling them and recruiting them.\n\nEach faery type had their natural weaknesses, nature/grass are weak to fire, who's weak to water, who's weak to nature.  Some mature faster, while other are better attacker, defenders, or support. Water isn't always powerful, but have heals. Nature can poison and run around while regenerating their health. Stone are tough, but rather slow overall, while fire focuses a lot on offence.\n\nAs the faery level, they gain skill slots of attack, defence, or support/passive. They are mostly tuned to a single element, but some morph to be able to hold 2, or any, element type.\n\nThe faery in the world with you will be the first in battle, and usually offer some benefit in the world around them, like onlock element locks around the maps, or reveal hidden items.\n\nYou buy orbs to capture faery in level ranges. You can also buy/sell skills you don't need.\n\nAs you gather more faery, you can return home to see them flying around your flat.\n\nThe biggest buggy part is the menus. They tend to be jumpy, while the actual gameplay will be a lot smoother. If it could support FULL HD someday, that would be great.\n\nThe story is cute, the puzzles aren't too hard, and for me, is a nice relacing game to play.\n\nAs a personal suggestion will be re-adjusting the controls to ASDW from their ARROW presets. For me, it makes travel better, and also makes changing faery in battle quicker.","August 21, 2015","true","22.7"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","37","43","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadowrend09/recommended/384570/","Shadowrend09","Q","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadowrend09/","220 products in account","One of the best game ever made\n\nAsk yourself these questions: Do you like fantasy lore, RPG's, FPS, Pokemon, beautiful visuals, great soundtrack, a captivating story and more all that in a beautiful, large and very diverse semi-open world? If any of these are a YES, then go and buy Zanzarah. You will not regret it.\nI've been playing this game on and off since it came out (I just recently got it on Steam but I have a lot of hours with my CD). It is in my top 10 games ever, and I've played a lot of games.\n\nPlot: You play as Amy, a eighteen year old girl from London, UK. At the start of the game your house is visited by a swamp goblin Rafi, and he places a magical rune in your attic. Investigating the rune you are transported to the world of Zanzarah — a different realm. A realm of magic and faeries, strange creatures and odd landscapes. But you are transported there for a reason — you are the Chosen One, from the old legends which speak of a human girl to save the world of Zanzarah from an threat and unite Zanzarah with the human world. The story later further reveals that Zanzarah, Earth and the realm of Faeries was the same world and humans, faeries, dwarves, elves, goblins lived in peace. But humans became corrupted and the human world had to be cut off from the magical realms.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay consists of two main areas, the first is the RPG in which you play as Amy and navigate through the world talking to NPC's and solving platform elements. Amy mostly serves as a faery bag to be honest. The second is the FPS where you take part in faerie battles.\nPlaying as Amy you can talk to NPC's, collect items, pixies, and most importantly explore the world and capture faeries. Amy can also partake in a\nfew minigames and puzzles hidden around the world. Capturing faeries is the most important aspect. There are 77 different faeries, divided into twelve elements, each having advantages and weaknesses against eachother. You can only have five faeries in your deck, however you can go back to your house in London anytime in oder to change them. Faeries are usually caught at a low level, and then you have to train them against faeries of their own level in the wilderness (the world is divided into element and level areas) or at several trainers which costs money. Most faeries can evolve upon reaching a certain level into their other, which means they get new stats, look and spell possibilites. The maximum level for faeries is 60, and leveling and catching all faeries will take time and effort. Each faery can have four spells, two offensive and two defensive. Your faery can also gain a joker spell slot which means you can put a spell of a different or any element for it to use. I shall be making a Guide covering most of the game mechanics and good builds and decks.\n\nCombat: The combat only exists inside the Faery battles, and takes form of a FPS in a arena where you can move, fly around and hide. You have two sets of spells, and each has one offensive and one defensive. You can swap these around when not in a battle, and theres a bunch of different spells each changing the way you battle. Mana is limted, and spells can be charged for more damage (which should be done almost always). You can also swap between the five faeries in your deck at anytime, because some faery types do more damage against others. There is a certain tactical feel to it if you look at it at a certain angle, especially for some very difficult battles. The combat is very fun!\n\nGraphics: The graphics are outdated, but still beautiful. The game runs on DirectX 8.1, so it can be a problem streaming using OBS (personal experience). There are no HD resolutions, and it would be nice from Daedalic to update the DirectX and add more resolution options, as well as a windowed option. Apart from the technical stuff, the game still looks very pretty, the world is diverse, and tastefully made. The menus work and look very good.\n\nSound: The music is fantastic, especially the main theme sung by Kariina Gretere, similar to Enya. The other sound effects are fitting and of great studio quality, however some sounds can very, very, rarely sound too loud. Note that I've played this game for 13 years and I've basically saw and heard everything it could do so the chances for that happening is 1/10000000 for you :)\n\nMultiplayer: The game has some form of TCP/IP LAN multiplayer where you can use your gamesave deck and fight with your friends. You can use third-party programs like Game Ranger or Hamachi to play with your friends. Remember, this is a game from 2002 so don't expect any servers.\n\nSummary: Zanzarah: The Hidden Portal is a fantastic game that you are sure to love and play for a long time. It might be hard at start to get used to all the faery stuff, but the learning curve isn't very steep. The game has some very difficult sections, which require careful deck planning and leveling of faeries. The story can be speed-run in some fifteenish hours, mostly because you need to level up faeries in order to defeat certain enemies blocking passage or to progress the story. However it will surely take you double that much hours to finish the game with a normal tempo, and this just means finishing the main storyline without getting all the faeries or leveling them up, or even trying to collect  everything. To do that it will take at least 100 hours of gameplay if you are fast.\nThe only real negative sides of the game is the use of DirectX 8.1 if you're streaming, the resolution, and the biggest break is that after you finish the game, there is no save just a cutscene and then the game reloads to the last checkpoint. You can still go back and do whatever you want, just there isn't anything after the "ending".\n\nBut even with that taken in consideration, this is a gem not to be missed, and is worth more then its price, even when it's not on sale.\n\n*        Score                Graphics        7                Sound        9                Story        10                Gameplay        9                Combat        8","February 13","true","10.2"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","1"

Well I bet you didn't know there was a game for you!\n\nFirst off, let me say this is a very biassed review because I owned this game years ago and used to absolutely LOVE it. True the controls aren't the best but there's a lot of love in this game and its really quite charming. I've only played it a little so far but it seems to be a very stable and faithful port that works fine on newer versions of windows.\n\nThere's a very large variety of fairies to collect each with their own elements and attributes and each element has its own strengths and weaknesses, which is why its so easy to compare it to pokemon. But when you enter fights with wild fairies and other fairy trainers it transforms into a somewhat awkward but very playable quake style battle.\n\nAll in all its definitely worth getting at this price, especially if you used to love it as much as I did.","August 21, 2015","true","4.8"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","0"

For those curious, it's basically like Pokemon, but instead of going into a turn-based battle when you fight, you go into a first-person, Quake Battle Arena-style deathmatch where you control your creature. It really is an amazing game, and easily one of my all-time favorites.\n\nPros:\nSurprisingly-evoking thematics.\nNext-level Pokemon-style game.\nPlenty of creatures to choose from.\nComplex elemental matchups.\nCool creature evolutions.\nThe type of game we've wanted since the 90s.\nSkill-reliant gameplay.\n\nCons:\nA lack of diverse attack dynamics—no arcing shots, mines, scattershots, etc. Could be easily fixed by a good modding community.\nGame IS from 2002, so the graphics are somewhat dated.\nSome of the translations for certain attacks are inaccurate/confusing.\nMany of the creatures are fairies, which might be challenging to some people's masculinity.\nGame is amazing, but a Zanzarah 2 is unlikely due to the length of time that's passed since the games release.\n\nOverall:\nBUY THIS GAME.

In fact, I'd go as far as to say it's impossible not to instantly compae them unless you have never played pokemon before.  The only thing that really sets this game apart is that it's in a 3d environment and set in a sort of folklorish fantasy land full of elves and fairies and goblins.  I happen to be a fan of that genre, so I thought that was pretty cool.\n\nI won't get too much into the story, but the gameplay consists of running through scenic areas, looking for hidden items, bumping into other fairy trainers that want to fight you, and catching new kinds of fairies (in what are basically pokeballs) until you get to the next zone, which futhers the plot and gives you access to new kinds of fairies, which can have skills that also help you get past certain areas.  Again, very very reminiscent of pokemon, so if you love the good old days of red and blue, and want that in a 3d world with a whimsical fantasy feel, this game is definitely for you.  If you are more of a purist and hate ripoffs, stick with pokemon.  Keep in mind, this game was released only 4 or so years after pokemon.\n\nCombat takes you to an arena that I suppose is somewhere in the "fairy realm" or whatever, and takes place between two fairies at any given time.  Each fairy has certain stats that impact their ability to fly around and shoot other fairies, or resist attacks.  There are elemental types of damage so expect some rock/paper/scissors type party building.  A typical battle consists of you flying around the area, finding the other fairy, possibly switching fairies to the right element to match your opponent (which gets annoying, because the enemies will do the exact same thing as soon as you do) and then charging whatever ability you have and firing until it passes out and gets replaced by the next fairy in the opponent's roster.   This is my only main problem with the game.  I feel like they could have done a lot more with the way battles play out, and the skill sets seem limited to mainly just "shoot this beam at that thing."  That having been said, it still feels really good when you take your newly evolved super fairy in against something and it's like flying around with a dragon instead of a butterfly.\n\nI'd recommend purely because the formula works.  It's fun and addictive and the world is vibrant and full of interesting creatures.

The game doesn't run on NVIDIA cards, there is no fix for that, but when switching to Intel default card it works without any problems at all.\n\nThe game brings up alot of nostalgia, I remember playing the demo from a CD my cousin gave me one day, like 12 years ago. After installing it i played it non stop untill i finished it (1 sleep break). The gameplay is something that modern games lack: creativity. I love the x spell does damage to x fairy archetype, even if it has alot of elements from Pokemon games, the fact that it combines them with FPS combat it's what really makes this game shine. Not to mention countless hours of exploring the map and unlock areas that you always wondered what they hinder.\n\nThis is my favorite game of all times. If you don't have a Nvidia card, or if you have an additional Intel graphics card, buy it, you won't regret it.\n\n10/10 I will play it again somewhere in the near future.","August 30, 2015","true","60.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

The concept certainly seems interesting - a creature-collecting RPG with a first-person shooter combat system. What's not to love?\n\nLag. On a GTX 760. In 2015. For a game released more than a decade beforehand. That's what.\n\nYes, in a rather disgraceful move, Daedalic Entertainment saw it fit to release this game on Steam with some alleged fixes to the game to make it run on modern OSes, yet I have experienced occasional textures disappearing or flickering, as well as some downright nasty frame rate drops and mouse lag in the menus and dialogue sequences. Given that dialogue is a big part of the game, and the fact that the main menu obviously must be navigated in order to get into the game, this isn't a small issue, especially since the amount of lag tends to vary from menu to menu, and ESPECIALLY-especially given that this lag extends to dialogue windows. And in an RPG, which typically have quite a bit of dialogue, that really kills my enjoyment of this game.\n\nThe patterns I have seen on the forum seem to hint at the fact that Windows 10 seems to be the culprit here, and while I won't immediately jump to the conclusion that this is the cause, I am sincerely worried if it is. Because the fact that the developer makes a song and dance on the store page about updating it to work with modern iterations of Windows, yet conveniently leaves out that certain modern iteration of Windows that's been around for nearly a month at time of writing. Even longer if you count the public testing.\n\n(UPDATE: Having seen one other post, Windows 8 doesn't seem to be exempt from the menu lag either. This worries me immensely, so this has not changed my speculation on the situation.)\n\nIt may not be an expensive game, but I would still strongly recommend holding off on purchasing this game until Daedalic has made it abundantly clear that these issues with menu lag have been fixed. I also really hope Daedelic has learned their lesson here - while releasing a game from the last decade for a modern generation of users is a noble cause, if you aren't going to address every modern user and the issues they may come across, then either consider delaying it for fixes, or don't even bother. Absolute disgrace of an updated rerelease, and a stain on what I have heard is an underrated gem of a game.","August 24, 2015","false","0.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"
