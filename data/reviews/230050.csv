First part is easy and won't really challenge too much, except maybe finding all the hidden items.  The second part has a moderate challenge that adds wall-jumping (which Player must earn by getting the DLC), spikes and a hilarious ending.  It's great to play a game that makes you laugh most of the way through.  Also, for 100% achievement hunters, this game's list of achievements is short and reasonable.\n\nPerhaps not worth full price since the playing time is about 3 hours, but recommended whenever on sale.\n\nEDIT: changed "The game is broken" to "The game is divided" ...","May 6, 2014","true","3.4"," 221 of 245 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","221","245","0","16"

Everything in game is about DLC. For starters, when you start the game, you will have to "purchase" the DLC to jump, and even the DLC to pause.\n\nThe plot is simple, kill a boss, save a girl. You do so by jumping platforms to platforms collecting coins, and spend them to purchase DLCs that unlock extra quest or items to proceed the game.\n\nThe graphics and musics are simple, cute and colorful. The stages are easy, but some coins and DLC packages are well hidden, you might need to spend some time finding them.\n\nFor achievement hunters, all the achievements are easily obtainable. Except the 2 speed runs that requires a lot of practise (or just save-hack it).\n\nA very short game featuring a very small world. You could finish this game within an hour. It was fun while it lasted. :D\n\nI wish this game release more campaigns as DLCs.\n\nMy score: 10/10 (Buy it on sale!)","June 19, 2015","true","4.2"," 140 of 153 people (92%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","92","140","153","21","2"

In less than an hour I finished the main plot, but oh dear this made me smile all the time. It's a really nice satire to all those DLCs.\n\nAt the start you can't even go to the left, you don't have animations, no sound and you can't pause the game. But later you can do everything. From getting a hat to shooting everybody to death.\n\nThe humor in the game is just brilliant. I love it. There a signs everywhere that tell you what to do. So for example there is a dead end in a cave, so there is a sign: "Dead end." Just next to it: "No seriously, go back."\n\nThe people to talk to in the game, or even a horse, are also quite hilarious. One person sais: "I don't have anything relevant to say at this time. I'll play an important role soon, but you don't know that yet."\n\nThe cutscene at the beginning of the game is so bad it's really hilarious. The story of it. Haha.

It offers simple but diversified scenarios (some of theme are totally absurd). To me it was brilliant in some aspects, in others a bit too extreme but always funny. However, the whole thing is a fun and challenging adventure.\n\nUnfortunately, It's short-lived and there are only two chapters. Still It's quite cheap, so I recommend It to anyone who desires to spend a few hours having fun.\n\nItalian Version:\nRegalatomi da un amico, ho voluto provare questo gioco, iniziandolo senza troppe pretese.\n\nUn indie satirico e polemico, riguardo al sempre aumentare dei contenuti scaricabili dopo la vendita di un eventuale gioco(contenuti che in realtà dovrebbero essere già inclusi nello stesso).\n\nIl gioco non ha una vera e propria trama, o meglio, è il solito ''save the princess'' alla Mario. Offre scenari semplici ma diversificati (alcuni proprio assurdi). L'ho trovato geniale, in alcuni punti, in altri un po' estremo, ma sempre ironico. Nel suo insieme, comunque, è un'avventura più che divertente e stimolante.\n\nPurtroppo è poco longevo e ci son solo due campagne, tuttavia il costo è poco elevato, quindi lo consiglio a tutti quelli che voglion passare un paio d'ore divertendosi.","January 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 53 of 60 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","53","60","4","0"

You cannot die, there's close to no physics and unlike the Stanley Parable; when you replay this game, you will get all the same things. However, this game does give an important message about DLC overkill in games. In most games, you will see pre-order bonuses, retailer exclusives, overpriced and stupid DLCs which don't really enhance the game so much as to justify the purchase of DLCs, they seem to serve as novelties nowadays.\n\nThis is what makes this game important. Remember the days around the PS2 era where if you bought a game, you got the whole game and not just parts of it which will be filled in with DLC. That made games more exciting and more worth paying for. That all changed with the dawn of expansion packs for the big MMOs and Horse Armour (I'm looking at you, Oblivion!) but it isn't entirely for the worst from what I have seen. The DLCs for Saints Row: The Third have added many hours to the game and are of decent quality rather than being lousy 20 minute long stories which I thought was cool.\n\nThe only real issue I have with the game is the fact that I, and many others already know that a lot of DLC is pointless on the PC unless a game doesn't have mod support and on PC, mod support is always expected and always demanded for it to constitute "a real PC game" which is fair enough knowing that mods are changing the face of the games industry, but this satire is very relevant for consoles, which don't have mods, so console gamers rely upon the release of overpriced DLC to get new stuff in their game.\n\nIt's good for a laugh, the platforming is fairly easy and it can be quite entertaining, just don't buy it for full price.","November 28, 2013","true","3.9"," 57 of 79 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","57","79","0","0"

Sure, as someone who is involved in games a lot I recognized the reference, but it felt like it was relying on the puncline alone to be the joke.\n\nThis game plays like a typical platformer like mario, except it doesn't do a good job. The entire thing is platforming and it's very floaty and slidy. For me, it was not really a pleasure to play. It was simply a game I wanted to finsh because people told me it was short.\n\nThe concept of finding all of the coins is fine for buying the next item to unlock the next area but, but margins of what is available and what is not means you're searching the entire level of any single missing coins. This causes tons of worthless backtracking looking for hidden sides of walls trying to get that next amount of coins. The snow area was the greatest offender in this regard. You're playing it for the jokes and humor, but you have to get past all the annoying stuff to get to it.\n\nSure, for the price on or off sale it's good value for the time, but even for maybe an hour or so of solid gameplay it's incredibly boring and full of filler. You're playing it for the references. Which aren't worth it. If you want a good experience, play the first chapter and uninstall it.\n\nIf you want jokes about the games industry go read the hundreds of comics about games online. You'll be more entertained.

I'll see what this is like"\n\nThen I played the game, and it was exactly what the trailer made it look like, and yet for some reason I didn't particularly enjoy the experience.\n\nThere are two major issues with this game:\n\nFirstly, I'm not sure what type of audience this game was going for. The game is a stupendously easy platformer. Any seasoned gamer in any way, shape or form is going to breeze through this game. I feel like I could introduce my non-gaming girlfriend to this game and she'd complete it without too much trouble. Naturally then, you'd think that this game would be for absolute gaming beginners, but the issue was that is that non-seasoned gamers aren't going to understand the myriad of gaming references in this game.\n\nSecondly, the game is essentially one big joke that wears thin well before the ending (which should clock in around 1.5 hours I think). Yes, we're all annoyed at DLC, but all of the comments and complaints can be found on just about every gaming forum, or within the comments section of any gaming article. Not once in the two hours or so that I spent playing this game did I ever come close to laughing, per se. It's almost similar to a really bad pun in real life - you hear it, you smirk a little, then you shake your head.\n\nOther than those two issues, the game was okay. The controls are certainly responsive and the graphics and music were more or less adequate for what they were trying to accomplish. The game clocked in at around 2 hours for me, a lot of which was spent backtracking and looking for the few coins that I missed. The game also has very little replay value once you're done (especially if you managed to collect everything the first time).\n\nOverall, I just can't recommend this game to a wide audience. Not so much because it's not worth the money (I think I bought it for around $0.80 AUD) but rather because I don't think it's worth the time. You'd never want to play this game over a decent platformer like Super Meat Boy, for example.","June 27, 2014","false","1.7"," 49 of 76 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","49","76","0","1"

You are sent back and forth to explore new land... and buy DLC. The whole point of this game, buy DLC and enjoy the game. The game itself was pretty simple and short. It only took me an hour and a half to beat both modes. Bosses are simple and DLC is cheap (as in price). Pretend of this as a Super Mario Bros game, except that there are less coins and every coin is a DLC pack. This is what the game is.\n\nThe game in my opinion is amazing, especially from how short it is. Somehow, the developers were able to cram such humor and detail into a small game. At the end, the player feels accomplished of what they had done. I have never seen a game with such a great and short storyline. This kind of emphaizes the saying, short and sweet.\n\nI would highly recommend this game. It is a short, filled-to-the-brim game of detail that also, contains trading cards and achievements.

It's not worth 4 refined(1.20€) and it's definitely not worth 3€. I've had more entertainment value with flash games. Seriously, the main story is about 45 minutes long and the other one is half an hour, and this is considering that I went out of my way to collect all the coins. I've played higher quality and longer flash games than this.\n\nThe humour is non-existent except in the form of boring memetic references, which one of the characters says, mocking the game industry. Way to shoot yourself in the foot guys. The gameplay is honestly nothing special. Buy obvious DLC, get coins, buy more DLC. I was really enjoying myself until I got about half an hour in and got an achievement(awardment, ha ha) saying that I had unlocked all bonus DLC, and that's when I really got disappointed. I continued jumping and coin collecting and within 10 minutes, the main story was beat. Time for the secondary story which is more of the same but with different DLC and an even less coherent plot.\n\nMaybe it's because I had high expectations for this game, but seriously, one hour of exactly the same monotonous platforming(with no replay value for anyone but speedrunners and completionists, might i add) is hardly acceptable for a proper release. Avoid this one until the DLC that isn't actually DLC but rather a better game comes out. DLC Quest is a perfect example of how the games industry is dying, and not because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC, but because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games whether they be 3€ or 60€.","February 13, 2014","false","0.9"," 53 of 95 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","53","95","0","0"

It is hardly going to be news to anyone that some of the practices creeping in to gaming are unpopular, or at best divisive. There are some thoughts that, with the birth of microtransactions and freemium set-ups, we are heading toward some sort of dystopian future for games.\n\nThat's where DLC Quest comes in! An indie developed 2D platformer which pretty much bases itself in this vision of the future of gaming, where anything you could possibly want in a game comes...as an extra!\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean that the game becomes extortionately expensive, as this is done with tongue planted firmly within the cheek. It serves to ridicule not only the poor practices that are heading this slippery slope, but also other parts of the general gaming world.\n\nDLC Quest offers two separate, but linked, campaigns – DLC Quest and Live Freemium or Die, which are both provided in the package. Fortunately, the developers obviously resisted the urge to forge a bond with the ironic and hypocritical by making Live Freemium or Die into paid downloadable content.\n\nSo what's the context behind the parody? Well, in DLC Quest, the player takes control of Player, a sprite-come-hero that is dragged into the the perils of the village, aided in his various quests by the magnanimous shopkeeper offering all sorts of goodies that are necessary for defeating the bad guy and saving the princess and all of the other gaming clichés you can think of. It must be said that DLC Quest is very short and to the point, with some (but not a lot) of exploration to be done before even 100% completion.\n\nLive Freemium or Die is a “direct sequel” of sorts to DLC Quest, and provides a much more fleshed out experience than that of the former. Continuing the rather contrived storyline to this point of DLC Quest, Live Freemium or Die CONTINUES following Player as he investigates a recent string of related deaths in the village, providing a much larger scale of map for exploration and a slightly more directed story than the first part of the duology.\n\nGameplay-wise, the DLC duo doesn't really do anything to innovate, nor does it do anything particularly wrong. The game plays as a fairly simple 2D platformer, with each game providing a slightly different platforming mechanic to get around with. It must also be noted that Live Freemium or Die adds a little more of the challenge that DLC Quest was pretty much devoid of. That being said, it's hardly Super Meat Boy and won't provide too much of a headache to anyone. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it allows many people to enjoy the concept and humour within, but don't come in expecting to be tested.\n\nSo if DLC Quest isn't going to win awards for its gameplay, what about the graphics and sounds? Well, once you've unlocked the audio and visual packs, it can be seen that it is a fairly basic affair. The 8-bit visual style pays good homage to the early days of gaming history, whilst the fairly catchy (albeit short, much like the game) chiptune background music also adds to the aesthetic. These provide a great contrast to the issues of modern and future gaming models that the game attempts to address.\n\nSo, if you're wanting a AAA blockbuster that's going to provide you with hours of content and the complexities that come with it, then you are looking in the wrong place. If you're wanting a technical masterpiece or keyboard smashing difficulty, then your experience is not here. If, however, you are looking for a short and simple distraction, at only a fraction of the PRICE of a map pack, with plenty of satirical amusement (As such, it could be described as a much more concise version of what Duke Nukem Forever tried to be), then look no further than DLC Quest – and be happy that the industry haven't quite plunged to the depths that the game attests to!\n\nUnlock Final Review Score Pack: 8 coins","June 13, 2015","true","8.1"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","64","16","25","9","0"

You start out only being able to move right. You need to unlock and purchase your way through the game via downloadable content. Don't worry, you use in-game coins to purchase the packs. You need to buy things as basic as sound, animation, and free movement as well as new abilities and cosmetic changes. I'd go into more detail, but explaining the joke would ruin the experience for you. Just know there are some very clever bit of DLC and dialogue that do a good job exaggerating the ridiculous nature of many greedy modern games. The basic plot is to save the princess in the first episode, and to save the town in the second. Most of the achievements are simple, requiring you to simply go through the quest. You can collect all the coins, find and purchase all the DLC packs, and beat the game. There are a few more difficult ones, such as the speedrunning achievements, if you're looking for replay and challenge. I like the music, the art, and the humor. It's a fun little game, but it does have a few problems.\n\nOne problem with this game is that it's short. It has a lot of clever things to experience and a decent sized world, especially with the two combined campaigns, but it's still only going to take, at most, a few hours to beat. Also, while the humor hit me well, it may not be for everyone. That, and the fact that after you go through the game and get all the jokes, you're left with just the gameplay experience. This is a bit of a problem because, while it is a good experience as a whole, if the humor gets old then you're left with a short and very easy game. It coasts on the satire, perhaps to a fault. I'd like to see a larger game with this style because the controls, art, and music were all good... but this isn't going to be one you want to replay tons of times unless you're a speed runner. Also, I would've liked more music themes in the game, but the ones that are there are very catchy so I can give that a pass.\n\nOverall, DLC Quest a pretty fun little game that makes fun of ridiculous practices in modern games. If you like classic games, satire, and simple fun then you'll probably enjoy this little experience. I feel it has enough here to be worth the 3 dollar asking price, but if you're on the fence about it, just know that it does seem to go on sale now and then for less. It you want have a little fun with a retro style game that pokes some fun at newer ones, this is for you. Here's hoping we get more games with this nice kind of control and level design in the future. DLC Quest get a 6/10 for being a rather shallow game that makes up for its shortcomings in very clever design humor.","April 11, 2015","true","2.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

DLC Quest offers fun RPG that continually makes you laugh by showing you what is wrong with gaming companies.\n\nStory:\nThe adventure begins as Player arises within the middle of 2D world. Only able to more right he must find currency that represents real money to buy DLC that unlocks all the basics the game didn’t come with. The princess has been kidnapped and it is up to Player to go and save her from a bad guy, who is like a wizard.\n\nCampaign:\nThere is no difficulty for this game, in fact there is essentially no combat, and you can’t die. Yet you will continually fight on to collect as many coins as possible. You will meet NPCs that provide you with little to no information, and will continually joke about their purpose. As you progress through the game you will unlock DLC that is required to complete the game, and even have the option to buy DLC that just jazzes it up. The campaign isn’t very long, but it keeps you gripped and there are many little secrets that make you want to keep playing.\n\nGameplay:\nThis game gives you a weapon, and the ability to move and jump. You will essentially be running around collecting coins the entire game. There will essentially be no combat, and no reason you should die. In fact the game is a huge waste of time, but it’s hilarious and you will play it anyway. The game is simple and the mechanics are basic, but what makes this game unique is that every little aspect must be purchased with the in game currency. Don’t worry you won’t actually spend any real money as you will find the required currency to purchase the upgrades throughout the levels.\n\nLive Freemium or Die Hard:\nFunnily a game called DLC quest actually has no DLC. The second campaign is free and it includes all new levels and even the ability to die. There are traps and even some fights which pose all new challenges to the story. The game offers all new puzzles, abilities, jokes, and DLC that make for a riot. It’s definitely worth checking out, even if it’s not DLC.\n\nResults:\nThis game is reasonably priced at about $2.99; realistically you will probably play this game for 2-hours so it’s about $1.50 an hour if you want to look at it like that. The campaign is witty and gives a new look to how the gaming industry has changed over the years. DLC Quest sheds a light on how most games today offer DLC that should be included with the initial product. It includes funny jokes, interesting level design, and a simple story that makes you want to actually beet the game. If you like simple platformers and enjoy finding secrets then DLC Quest is the game for you. I would recommend this game, especially if it is on sale.\n\nPros:\n+Simple game mechanics\n+Two campaigns\n+Lots of DLC (none of which you actually pay money for)\n+Funny dialogue and game design\n+Amazing story (Where is the princess? What happened to all the villagers?)\n+You can totally complete the Grindstone without using the DLC XP Boost. You even get a special message for doing it, but no achievement.\n\nCons:\n-Not as much DLC as promised (I want to give them real money so I can unlock a jetpack horse)\n-On Live Freemium or Die Hard if you buy all the DLC you may find yourself stuck at the last section (as there are only enough coins to barely get you through the campaign).","June 30, 2014","true","2.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If, like me, you manage to somehow miss 14 coins you could end up running around for an hour trying to find them. This might not make sense right now, so early in a review, but if you play it you'll understand.\n\nWhat DLC Quest does is capture the current state of AAA Games and makes a great social commentary (that's 'satire' to you and me) game out of it. The concept is simple, you're a player and you're in a gameworld, but everyday 'normal' abilities don't seem to be present... until you visit the DLC STORE!\nIt's one of the true funny games I've played over the years and really manages to put the humor across nicely.\n\nIn terms of gameplay DLC Quest isn't too far removed from your 16-bit platform adventure games, so don't expect anything amazing or groundbreaking in that regard. However, the 'story' really makes this game something worth playing, if only to spot all the references and go 'ooooh yeah, I know that!'.\n\nSo if you have an hour or two spare and want a little break from the AAA-Games scene, and have a spare £1/$1 to your name than you could do far worse than buying DLC Quest. It's a game that is self aware and runs with it, providing funny moments along the way.

Having unenjoyable game mechanics for the sake of reminding the player that said mechanics are not enjoyable is not a good idea.

Especially off course the constant DLC releases. Starting the game you can only move to the right and you have to buy DLCs for everything including jumping, weapons, horse armor (Oblivion anyone?) etc. Keep in mind that you buy those with in game money.\nThe game includes two campaigns but don't expect them to last too long. Both of them are pretty small but still you can have a good time playing them. There are many fanny moments and playing through the game you will recognize a lot of references to other games.\n\nBeing an indie game don't expect great graphics or sound effects. On the other hand the controls are pretty simple which is something that suits the game a lot. DLC Quest is mainly a platformer and you will spend the whole time jumping to platforms  and avoiding traps, but there aren't any enemies at all.\n\nSo in conclusion DLC quest is a game that will give you a few hours of fun and laughts and that's it.\n\n80%","January 26, 2014","true","10.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

But then again, I only paid 75 cents for it. As a Team Fortress 2 player, I loved the Top Hat DLC pack. DLC Quest gives you the experience of paying for either 1) useless cosmetic items or 2) story-essential items, without actually coughing up the cash for it.\n\nMoreover, as a long-time reader of The Order of the Stick and the like, I'm a sucker for stories like DLC Quest, stories which acknowledge their own potential stupidity and cut out the middleman by embracing it. It's able to laugh at itself in a way that few non-indie games can.

Animations, and sound, etc is now for DLC, I find it quite dumb, but silly at the same time. See, this is what I like and hate the game! You like it, and yet hate it at the same time! You start out with just moving to the right, no way to jump, (This means you HAVE to buy DLC to jump...) Move to the left, animations, sounds, etc just for coins. I managed to finish the game solo, and yet it was quite easy. The first time my old friend RavenGamer42 actually sent me this game, I had no idea what it was. I played it a bit, and I actually got a hang of it. Moving is like the others, but unlike the jumping from other games, You have to press Z to jump, and X to do something with a sword. Speaking of swords, There's a DLC for making the swords faster. "Time is Money" I believe, and yet I find it silly, and interesting with that name. Time doesn't really earn you money... but I think they used that saying in different movies! Well, out of all of that aside, No spoilers wanted, Play it yourself!

Controls were good (using xbox360 gamepad), and platforming wasn't too difficult, but not trivial either.  It is simply a platformer where you gain additional abilities over time that help you get further.  The humor was decent too.  There are 2 campaigns, "DLC Quest" and "Live Freemium or Die", both of which were fun.  I spent less than an hour completing the first with 100%, and 2 hours on the 2nd.  Note, if you buy all DLC too quickly, you might miss some of the humor (especially the first campaign).  I recommend buying as you need it.  I do wish I held off on buying some in the second campaign so I didn't have to hunt so hard for the remaining coins I missed when I needed something.  The only DLC I actually regret getting, is the brown filter, which just made it harder to see things.  I'd rather have gone back after beating it once.  I had to look up a guide only once when I was way short of money and wasn't sure what I was missing.  At some point in the 2nd campaign you buy some DLC that expands the world, and you just have to know where, or you will be hunting around for a while.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eggdodger/recommended/230050/","Eggdodger","Eggy♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eggdodger/","117 products in account","This little nugget is the product of angst in the gaming community over DLC, freemium games and all things microtransactional. It sets out to entertain you with satire, and to its credit, it doesn't fail in that respect. The protagonist is anything but silent, and I can't help but admire the amount of personality the developer squeezed into him. There were many moments that made me laugh out loud, and it wasn't always the dialogue, as there are many gags in the levels themselves.\n\nWhile the overall experience is stellar, it's only sub-par as a game. Platforming is functional, albeit a tad slippery, but nothing a veteran can't handle. For most people it will take 4 hours, but if you're savvy in the platforming genre it won't take longer than two hours to beat both campaigns, a little longer to hunt down the achievements you may or may not have missed. Despite the humor being bust-out hilarious, the segments in between, collecting coins, avoiding spikes, jumping gaps, can feel somewhat forced in that they are only there to reinforce the "game" element. I found myself rather bored at one point attempting to find the rest of the coins I needed to open the door to the final boss, only to realize I've been taking the wrong turn to the last depot of coins the whole time. It would help if there were some sort of way to know where you missed coins, but unfortunately, despite all the comical "DLCs" available for purchase, there is no "Coin Radar" or the like. Arguably, though, that would have detracted from the overall message that games that rely on unnecessary DLC (especially DLC that should have been included in the base game) for their business model will ultimately alienate their players. I will recommend this game on the assumption that you will take this more as a narrative, comedic experience than a "game".","July 2, 2014","true","2.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's fun to play, has a charming atmosphere, and is quite humorous in poking fun at lots of cliches and tropes of the video game industry. At its core, it's a simple, comedic sidescroller with an ostensibly generic storyline, yet it never hesitates to point out its own the irrational logic, from its cliched characters to the seemingly bizarre aspects that are currently part of today's gaming industry.\n\nThe premise behind DLC Quest is that a bad guy captures a princess, so obviously it's your job to stop him and rescue the damsel in distress. Heard this story a million times before? So have the developers at Going Loud Studios, so what they've done is put their own spin on this age-old premise. Your task is to first collect enough coins to buy DLC within the game world itself. A clear commentary on the cash-grubbing nature of the video game industry, these little packs are initially required in order for you to do the most basic actions, such as moving both in directions and being able to pause the game, As you progress, the game gives you some nice aesthetic features as well as weapons/items.\n\nI was surprised at how good the control is. The jumping mechanic feels like the original Super Mario Bros. (where you can control height and momentum in the air), which I appreciate immensely. You move left and right at a reasonable pace, too. The controls are customizable and the graphics are vibrant and appealing. Aesthetically, the game's design gives it an NES feel. The dialogue is often hilarious, with characters acknowledging their ridiculous requests or their arbitrary roles in making you run off and do stuff because...uh, that's how games work. DLC Quest on a whole is very tongue-in-cheek that way. That being said, there were a couple things that I thought could be improved. To progress through the game, you obviously need to get enough coins to purchase certain DLC items, but a couple of times I couldn't figure out where to go, because I thought I had cleared out all the areas. Turns out there are some secret areas you have to look for where the walls are missing their borders, which are easy to miss. There are also some areas that you might not realize you can get to for similar reasons (boulders or bushes obscured by the foreground, etc.). Otherwise, I found the platforming to be relatively easy, simple enough for an old fogey like me to get through.\n\nOverall, I think DLC Quest is a very creative, imaginative, quirky, charming, humorous game well worth its price point. It pokes fun at itself and other gaming cliches, but even though it admits its own "faults," it still kept me wanting to play. If you're at all into sidescrollers, I'd recommend giving this one a try.","July 23, 2014","true","1.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I wanted to support anything that openly mocks the shady techniques publishers have started using to slowly and steadily squeeze each penny out of their customers. The game had a few classic references to cyber-hardships many gamers would remember. In fact, some of the gameplay was intriguing and really struck home. However, the game seemed to be lacking something.

But it adds its own little twists on it. The game's entire point is satire of the gaming industry, judging by the title you can tell that the game mainly capitalizes major titles including most of its content or fixes in paid DLC (I'm looking at you, EA). Purchasing DLC is absolutely imperative to the game; everything from having music, animation and being able to walk to the left to getting an extremely overpowered gun, and minor DLC's such as making everyone wear a bikini or a top hat.\n\nThe game is well designed and its satirical form of humor is quite welcome. Making fun of everything from titular downloadable content, to the recent uprising of games with silhouette graphics (To, as the game puts it, "make games more artsy and trendy") to people that won't stop spamming the same lines like "Do a barrel roll!" or "All your base belong to us".\n\nThe game is fun, although I'd rather get it when it's on sale (You can get it for 75 cents on HumbleBundle (Another thing that the game makes a vague reference to) right now). It's a neat little indy collectathon with tight controls, fun pixelated graphics, well-done (although slightly repetitive at times) music and a fun sense of humor. Although, even with getting all the DLC, coins and achievements (Or "awardments"), it's still short and you can finish the game quickly. Though, you still can get a few hours out of it. So I recommend it.\n\n9/10","May 19, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's about how games today use DLC for everything, so in the beginning of the game you have no sound or pause menu, you can just move left and collect coins. Soon you use these coins to "buy" the DLC like movement, music, clothing, etc. and the game evolves as you play it because of this. i'd say buy it whenever you can if you're looking for something quick and fun because it's funny, short, and easy","June 21, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lighthearted and humorous, DLC Quest pokes fun at the ridiculous amounts of DLC in games these days, while also being a solid and enjoyable platformer. I had seriously planned to not like this game because "yay! Another platformer where you collect coins!", and based on the graphics I was expecting something like a flash browser game with horrible controls and an unfinished feel. My plans were ruined!\n\nYou do collect coins, but that's as far as my expectations made it. I found the controls to be tight, with a minimal amount of slide after letting off a key. Any times I missed a jump and fell, I felt it was more my fault than any fault of sloppy controls. The graphics are retro-ish and very fitting for the style and atmosphere of the game. The sound also fits nicely. The satirical finger-pointing at the DLC market, and the humorous comments from the characters, round out a quick and FUN little platform game!\n\nOH, I will add that the first time I ran this game, I set a widescreen resolution in the options, and the first character I talked to, I got my first Windows 8 blue screen. I don't know for sure this game was the problem, but the BSOD was "DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL" and a quick google search told me this error happens with bad drivers or bad applications.

Controls are a little loose when playing with a controller, but the gameplay is very forgiving.\n\nI have to recommend DLC Quest with reservations, as the price may seem a little high for something that's fairly simple & ultimately a one-shot experience.  The addition of "Live Freemium or Die" helps extend the game's content beyond the original game (adding to value), but it's more of the same.","September 23, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If a game comes out and the designers make something new for it and they want an extra buck, they sell that bit of coding as DLC rather than making it an update for the game. Games such as Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim are known for having plenty of DLC, if you’re willing to spend another 5 bucks to buy whatever it provides. DLC can range from new characters, items, enemies, maps, quests, and practically anything else. DLC is completely optional to buy, you can still play the game without it, however the developers would prefer that you DO buy it.\n\nYou do not need DLC to finish the game\n\nWell, there’s one game that’s an exception.\n\nDLC Quest Review\n\nDLC Quest is a quirky, funny, no-holds-barred 8-bit platformer that revolves around buying in-game DLC. It has the normal platforming elements such as collecting anti-gravitational coins floating in midair, jumping on unsuspended grass platforms that are oddly stable, and killing helpless innocent sheep because it’s a video game and there’s no real life consequences.\n\nThe DLC part of the game is where the humor begins. When you start the game, you can only walk to the right. No jumping, no crouching, heck, there’s not even any animation to your character. You shortly come across a salesperson who decides to break down the fourth wall and sell you DLC with the coins that you collect in the game. You then buy animations, basic movement, wall jumping, guns, zombies, elaborate moving backgrounds, the works.\n\nDLC Quest likes to poke fun at other video games. For example, if you walk to a certain spot in the game, you will have a random encounter with a familiar character with blond, spiky hair and an extremely oversized sword. He refuses to let you pass, until you end up buying some DLC that serves practically no purpose to you or the super soldier that stands in your way, but he wanted it for reasons even he doesn’t know about. you give him the DLC, and you move on.\n\nThe game is quirky and funny, but is rather short. Though it has two parts to it, DLC Quest is only about two hours long. The only sidequests in the game are hidden DLC packs you can unlock that serve little purpose to gameplay. Once I completed the game, I found little reason to revisit it again.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nDLC Quest is fun while it lasts, but the only problem is that it doesn’t last long. It has a great sense of humor and is a nice addition to anyone’s platformer library.\n\nDLC Quest: 7.5/10","March 25, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's another game (not this one) that has goofy control that was funny at first but that I wasn't really willing to cope with to actually finish that game past its second stage.\n\nIn this case, this game does a lot of jokes about the bad DLC practices that happen a ton in some modern gaming where, instead of true bonus content you can buy if you want more, they nickel and dime you for things you need to enjoy the game in the first place. There was a point in the game where I saw the reviews that said the makers drew the game out too long and the joke gets spent up and trying to complete everything becomes tedium instead, and I could see that they had felt the game had outstayed its welcome on its gimmicks.\n\nI could understand that perspective but not personally share it. While I won't try to get every single achievement (I've got all but two of them, and seeing what those two are I don't think I want to get myself out of sorts getting them)... I really enjoyed the jokes this game pulled and the bits of commentary it did. It turned its DLC jokes into actual gameplay mechanics in some cases, and each thing it had you 'buy' or do felt like a little unique bit of commentary under the overall DLC subject or in some cases actually ended up being things you would buy with in-game money anyway like better weaponry. I personally got a kick out of the guy who said he had nothing to say now but would be important later - I've seen plenty of RPGs that did just that, and were less upfront about it.\n\nAnyway, I guess what I'm saying is I personally enjoyed this game and the different DLC jokes it pulled instead of feeling like it outlived its fun like some other reviewers feel. At the very least, it's inexpensive enough that you can give it a go and walk away when you personally feel sated without breaking the bank, even if your experience doesn't mirror mine.\n","April 26, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is pretty hilarious, since you need to buy DLC to do even the most basic things, like jumping and moving left.\n\nFor the most part, the platforming is pretty easy, and most people should get through the game with little challenge. The game's also fairly short too. I beat both campaigns with 100% completion in 2.5 hours. DLC Quest is pretty much entirely held up by it's humor. If  you're familiar with video game culture in general, it will keep you laughing. You can even buy Horse Armor.\n\nThe graphics are basic pixel work, but it looks nice and it's appropriate for this style of platformer. The chiptune music is alright but not really memorable. The game thankfully controls pretty well, except that wall jumping may take some time to get used to.\n\nDLC Quest is easy and very short, but it's funny and it only costs $3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/necroninja17/recommended/230050/","necroninja17","An Exquisite Meme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/necroninja17/","104 products in account","Let’s start with defining what DLC is.\n\nDLC is an abbreviation for DownLoadable Content. If a game comes out and the designers make something new for it and they want an extra buck, they sell that bit of coding as DLC rather than making it an update for the game. Games such as Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim are known for having plenty of DLC, if you’re willing to spend another 5 bucks to buy whatever it provides. DLC can range from new characters, items, enemies, maps, quests, and practically anything else. DLC is completely optional to buy, you can still play the game without it, however the developers would prefer that you DO buy it.\n\nYou do not need DLC to finish the game\n\nWell, there’s one game that’s an exception.\n\nDLC Quest Review\n\nDLC Quest is a quirky, funny, no-holds-barred 8-bit platformer that revolves around buying in-game DLC. It has the normal platforming elements such as collecting anti-gravitational coins floating in midair, jumping on unsuspended grass platforms that are oddly stable, and killing helpless innocent sheep because it’s a video game and there’s no real life consequences.\n\nThe DLC part of the game is where the humor begins. When you start the game, you can only walk to the right. No jumping, no crouching, heck, there’s not even any animation to your character. You shortly come across a salesperson who decides to break down the fourth wall and sell you DLC with the coins that you collect in the game. You then buy animations, basic movement, wall jumping, guns, zombies, elaborate moving backgrounds, the works.\n\nDLC Quest likes to poke fun at other video games. For example, if you walk to a certain spot in the game, you will have a random encounter with a familiar character with blond, spiky hair and an extremely oversized sword. He refuses to let you pass, until you end up buying some DLC that serves practically no purpose to you or the super soldier that stands in your way, but he wanted it for reasons even he doesn’t know about. you give him the DLC, and you move on.\n\nThe game is quirky and funny, but is rather short. Though it has two parts to it, DLC Quest is only about two hours long. The only sidequests in the game are hidden DLC packs you can unlock that serve little purpose to gameplay. Once I completed the game, I found little reason to revisit it again.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nDLC Quest is fun while it lasts, but the only problem is that it doesn’t last long. It has a great sense of humor and is a nice addition to anyone’s platformer library.\n\nDLC Quest: 7.5/10","March 25, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are 2 "campaigns" in the game; DLC Quest and Live Freemium or Die. This is a 2D sidescroller platformer game where you collect a whole lot of coins to unlock the DLC in the game to do a different set of actions like move left and jump. Note: No real cash is required to purchase said DLC.\n\nDLC Quest First campaign\n\nIn the first campaign "DLC Quest", I found it to be very short and this was with me completing the campaign to the fullest extent including collecting all of the collectables and coins throughout the campaign. However I did enjoy the plot line, the Satire, and the Soundtrack. Also the DLC was quite amusing.\n\nLive Freemium or Die Second campaign\n\nThis second campaign "Live Freemium or Die", was quite the opposite of what I was expecting with the first campaign still in mind. Live Freemium or Die is quite lengthy and as of writing this I still haven't found all of the collectables. The unique level designs throughout this quest kept my interest and the plot line of this quest was even more interesting with a small twist  involving the shopkeeper that wants to make a profit. Soundtrack and Satire were still a welcomed enjoyment during this experience. Some of the DLC from the last quest weren't found in this paticular campaign however that doesn't mean the DLC humor wasn't just as funny.\n\nPros\nPlot Line\nSatire\nSoundtrack\nDLC Humor\nLevel Design\nCon\nLength in DLC quest\nI didn't find anything wrong with Live Freemium or Die\nFor $2.99 this is a great game if you want a couple of laughs.

The music is classic 8-bit styled and only gets annoying when you miss a single coin somewhere in the Live Freemium campaign and spend an eternity tracking it down. I recommend  you be thorough in the winter section, do that and you should be golden. The voice acting and motion capture could do with some work but otherwise it's a knockout! Seriously though, this game is pure fun from the mountains. Buy it and then forget about it in a few days like every indie game.

The story is relatable for those who got Steam just to play Skyrim, to people with 7437.9 hours on record: a whimsical reflection of the gaming industry and gaming commutiy, DLC Quest is a smart and sharp critique, but lighthearted in a way that makes the game have an air of fun. The icing on the cake is that after completing the main and extra quests, you can time yourself for speedruns. Also, it's on sale basically all the time, allowing you to get a fun, cutesy indie game that makes fun of as well as celebrates the quirks of the gaming industry and community for a low price.

You have to purchase DLCs for almost everything that makes the game! You want musics or sounds in it? buy the DLC... You want animations? buy the DLC... You want to jump? buy the DLC... You want to be able to walk left-side? buy the DLC... You want a village to explore? buy the DLC... You will have to buy most of them if you want to progress. There's a lot of humor and the game is obviously not affraid to break the 4th wall, along with lots of reference from other videogames.\n\nIf you're not affraid of playing an old-timed platformer, this one actually do feels like playing an old Nintendo Game. It is well made in that optic, with chiptune musics and all. The controls are very responsives and anyone used classic platformers such as Mario (or more recently SuperMeatBoy) won't have trouble with this one. It is very short, though.

You must pay (in game coins) to buy the ability to do what in 99.9% of games is commonplace such as: Jump, double jump, walk left, pause etc. The main game is very short (However there is a second part which is longer) it took me maybe an hour or two to beat it.

I got a funny message but it wasn't worth losing the function of both my arms. Other than that this game is great with a capital "D" and the "D" stands for "Awesome!".\nIt's short but its also cheap so, ya know... don't complain. It's also incredibly funny and just a joy to play. Particularly if you're aware of the state the gaming industry is with it's DLC Armageddon which I imagine you all are.\n\nThe game itself is an 8-bit style platformer with smooth controls and blah, blah, blah. There's nothing to fault the game with really, at all in fact. The music is classic 8-bit styled and only gets annoying when you miss a single coin somewhere in the Live Freemium campaign and spend an eternity tracking it down. I recommend  you be thorough in the winter section, do that and you should be golden. The voice acting and motion capture could do with some work but otherwise it's a knockout! Seriously though, this game is pure fun from the mountains. Buy it and then forget about it in a few days like every indie game. Unless you have friends to talk about it with and have a debate and/or ♥♥♥♥♥ about the money-grabbing publishers that are constantly finding new petty ways to pinch a pretty penny from your Polly pocket.","July 30, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Luckily the humor and message deliver in spades. Some times making you laugh, like really laugh, out loud and everything, while other moments will bring a flash of real world revelation, often evoking memories of specific games or publishers. Just don't blast through it or you will miss many of the jokes and references. It's about the journey, not getting to the end fastest.

Fetch quests! Brown palettes! Gratuitous zombies! Inane NPCs! And, of course, lots and lots of unnecessary (sexy outfits!) and necessary (walking left!) DLC.\n\nGameplay is a a standard simple platformer, in which you jump on platforms, avoid spikes, and collect coins to buy DLC.  However, the focus of this game isn't actually the "game" bit, but rather the humour, which I thought was done quite well. I laughed a few times, and while the game could perhaps be a bit tighter (the latter bit of the second quest stretched on a bit long), overall I had a smile on my face for most of it.\n\nFor $3, if you need a silly pick-me-up and have a couple of hours free, this game could hit the spot.","January 26, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It would then get an expansion pack "Live Freemium or Die" in 2013 for both platforms. Which was free for PC, but sold on Xbox 360, probably because of Microsoft policy. Because you know, they dislike hosting free stuff on their servers, as you heard being the reason why Valve wasn't updating Team Fortress 2 for Xbox 360. Anyway, I think that this also came to Steam only in 2013 as well. Yep, expansion pack / sequel included, no worries.\n\nAnd well, as you see, it's a simple platformer, that parodies everything DLC and modern. And you have to purchase DLC through in-game money in in-game shop, which after a while may start to look no different from what you do in normal games. Hm, maybe it could be more funny if they actually sold DLC as DLC for the game for extremely low-low price of one cent or such? But nah.\n\nYou know how it goes with most joke games: people say 10/10 for the premise but others start to hate them by the time they beat them. Such joke games must know boundaries and know when to end, as well as trying not to enrage people too much. Thankfully, DLC Quest knows them and ends when it should. It does seem short, but at least it kept fresh enough until the end and was enjoyable.\n\nNot to mentioning that game is enjoyable by itself for a very short time that it playes. You just explore small map, find some curious stuff, collect money, platforming is responsible and easy. Original DLC Quest campaign doesn't allow you to die and is shortest. Live Freemium and Die adds some challenge to keep players enganged after original, mostly by adding spikes that will kill and send you back to checkpoint. But they are still pleasent and nothing compared to flood of indie "hard platformers for sake of hard".\n\nSo yea, game looks pretty enough with some 8-bit-like music that is enjoyable and doesn't try to do a horrible joke. It also makes you question many life-important things. Like, why Season Pass is called Season Pass? No, seriously. Or how much developers went insane with tiny DLCes. Even though you all probably just wait until game goes on huge sale where you buy bundle with all DLCs for dirt cheap anyway.\n\nBut yes, it doesn't overstay the welcome and has enjoyable simple platforming, so you can spend a hour or two on it. Unless you try to do two hidden hardcore speedrun achievements or try to beat scores.\nJust try to get it while it's on sale. Not because game costs too much. Doesn't matter what discount. You just should be able to tell yourself that you got it during your crazy Steam sales impulses. Instead of asking yourself why you went so low into rabbit hole that you are fully purchasing joke games based on their premise and give them 10/10, while you could get some better proper game instead.\nAND HEY, ZOMBIE DLC!","October 3, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The mechanics are clunky.  The graphics are lousy.  There are maybe two hours of game play.  The characters and story… well there really aren’t any.\n\nIf you buy DLC quest for a biting and hilarious commentary on the video game industry, then you’ll be less disappointed.  The games features 30 DLC packs (one for each joke) and… oh, why bother.  There’s no sense in writing a review longer than the game itself.\n\nIn conclusion, if you ok paying 3 buck for gut busting cheap shots at video game companies, you should buy this.  If you can get it on sale, it’s worth every penny (all ninety eight of them.)  If you’re looking for a complete platformer… you’ll have to wait for the full release of this review (planned release 2nd quarter 2014, may include fixes for grammer and spelling.)","November 27, 2013","true","2.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

I took a gander and it looked amusing so I thought I would give it a go and I was actually pleasantly surprised with what I found.\nDLC quest is very simplistic. It hasn’t got a massively complex mind-twisting plot line, it isn’t overly hard gameplay wise, and it actually isn’t even that long of a game… but one thing for me was certain, despite all those things, it was very satisfying. It plays on the mechanics and features of classic adventure games well, and in a tasteful way. There’s so many references and fun things to find along the way that makes you chuckle to yourself and say “I see what they did there…” and I really think that the humour in this game is what makes it great even though it’s so simplistic.\nThe game also has this OCD “collect it all” thing going on as well, which I can never get enough of, especially if it’s somewhat easy to do. I spent around 2 hours on this game and left it 100% done, all “awardments”, all coins, everything. And it’s a great feeling being able to do that. It didn’t take long, sure.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/230050/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","DLC Quest is a satire of recent trends in the video game industry (based on the game's release) where companies are forcing more and more DLC and microtransactions on the players. Thus, this game is based more on its message and theme rather than giving a solid gameplay experience with story and impresssive design.\n\nThis game takes a somewhat retro graphical style mixed with a typical fantasy theme. The music is made up of chiptune tracks to fit in with the retro visuals. The story is as simple as saving a princess or saving a village from a bad guy, which are commonly seen in other games that aren't parodic in nature. These things though are the not very important parts to be looking for in this game. They get the job done by looking good enough from a technical standpoint to drive the game, since these three things are parodies of commonly seen styles and tropes in other games.\n\nEven though this game is a parody and satire of video games, there is some actual gameplay to be had. The player runs and jumps to collect coins and somethimes kill things in this platformer game. To unlock new "features", the player needs to spend their coins on DLC and microtransactions, somewhat mirroring the real world with exaggerations. The gameplay ranges from easy in the first episode to a sightly more difficult, but not hard difficulty in the second episode.\nDoes the game satirize the video game industry well? It does do so in a blunt, exaggerated manner which ends up being silly game expansions the player has to buy. If the game isn't poking fun at video game companies, it then has parodies of games, ranging from making fun of certain game genre conventions to referencing specific video games. Not all the humor will leave people laughing out loud, but it should give a small laugh or chuckle for the things DLC Quest parodies.\n\nDLC Quest should be taken as a game with a message, and it does bring some silliness when it comes to parodying the games industry. This game is definitely short, easy, and low priced, which should give a decent amount of time for the money. With a satirical and comical approach to DLC and microtransactions, this game is great for the humor along with decent platforming collectathon gameplay on the side.","July 30, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

It succeeds where other similar satires fail (I'm looking at you, 2004 Bard's Tale!) because rather than drag on and on trying to milk that single joke into a full-length game, DLC Quest is - wisely - a very short experience As in, less than an hour long to get to the end. As such, it is barely worth it's price, especially since the gameplay is that of an uninspired platformer. Still, it's rare that a game gets me to crack an honest smile so even if it does seem a bit overpriced, I'll forgive it because it actually was funny.","November 25, 2013","false","1.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Simple graphics, simple two button gameplay but that doesn't mean it isn't fun. While I do recommend the game I would advise only to buy it if it's on sale due to its short length (as other reviewers have said too).\n\nThe only negative I can think of is the zero replay value unless you are going for 100% achievements.

Indeed, the "humor" in it much resembles the comedian they put in the game to make fun of people making obvious jokes or gaming references.\n\nThe "DLC" in the game didn't feel like DLC, and buying it didn't feel like buying DLC. On the whole, I felt like the game completely missed the mark, and indeed, most of the "DLC" in the game didn't even feel like DLC in the first place.\n\nI would love to say the game was one-note but it was really more zero-note; no matter how cheap it is, it isn't worth your time.

The first impression of the technical side of this game is pleasant.\nThe humor suffers a good bit from the fact that the game pokes fun at itself in such an in-your-face way, not hinting, but more like telling a joke and announcing when the punchline will come and what it is about. The kind of 'humor' that can sometimes sound more like a sarcastic rant. An NPC saying stuff like "I'm a filler NPC. I have no purpose." isn't really funny. Those things make the game look more like an interactive critical essay.\n\nThe gameplay logic is more interesting, because it depicts the design flaw of the illusion of choice in an extremely streamlined progression well.\n\nThe music is not bad.\n\nSo the game itself is mediocre at best AND it is so short that after having bought it for 1 EUR, which is 67% off, I feel that's a bit too much.\nIt has two 'campaigns'. (Not sure whether that was originally the case.) The first one I played through in a bit less than an hour. The second one in 1.2 hours, not with all achievements though.\n\nSome times I came up with better dialogues while playing because they leave so much to be desired. But some dialogue and gameplay is OK; It's not all lackluster. It's just overall an extremely mediocre experience; nothing memorable.\nThe best thing is, as I mentioned, the speedy menu navigation, and the equally crisp and fun controls.","November 30, 2014","false","2.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The writing, graphics gameplay were decent and I took something away from it all, but it wasn't enough to be worth the three bucks I wish I still had in my pocket, as I had purchased it before Steam refunds. Yeah, the game is that short, and you could still return it after first taking your time to play it and find everythng, then doing the speedrun achievement of under twenty minutes.\nIf this game was free, it would be something I highly reccomend everyone play at least once. Even then, the replayability is little as all jokes can be obtained in one playthrough of the game. This withholds any observations the player could make themselves are made by the main character, however.\n\nIn the end, just watch someone on Youtube play it because the game experience never changes in between each run. The message is worth knowing, but the game isn't worth playing for yourself unless it's free.","June 7, 2015","false","3.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Other than that, it is a simple platformer, with some occasional combat that consists of mashing a button to kill an enemy. There are secrets in the game such as places where you can walk through the wall and gain extra coins. There is also a selection of achievements that enhance the game by adding objectives. Overall it was worth the few dollars I spent on it: a simple platformer with a twist. The one problem I had is that it's extremely short; I was lucky to even get a few hours in it, as most playthroughs seem to take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.

So extreme its actually laughable. For example, one DLC was about Canadian dialogue, another DLC was about a NPC that is not pleased with himself, etc.\n\nThe game is easy, but in "Live Freemium or Die" there is some platforming and spikes that can kill you, although there are no lives and the checkpoints aren't far about.\n\nDespite the easiness and shortness of it, the game seems humorous to laughable extends and the retro like graphics actually look pleasing (assuming you disable the HD DLC pack!)","December 23, 2013","true","2.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The platforming is mundane, the characters are disappointing, the premise would be a little more entertaining if the environment around it wasn't so uninspired. The game itself gets bored and ends not half an hour in (it should be dangerously telling when there is an achievement for finishing the game in TWELVE MINUTES.)\n\nBut perhaps the worst thing about this game is the humour. It's so infuriatingly pleased with itself that I found myself looking for a DLC that would remove all of the words from the game, and also reach through the Internet and backhand the writer for actually trying to sell the hackneyed tripe I kept being forced to read. I came to dread every new line of dialogue with the insipid NPCs, mashing the "Get Through This Stupid Conversation" button in the hopes that it would turn out to be story related and I could move forward. And then, of course, I'd hit it one too many times, and the conversation would start over again. Argh.\n\nThe game, at one point, has a character that speaks entirely in old, unfunny memes. One of the "DLC packs" you are allowed to "buy" kills this character, and doing so is supposed to be some mixture of funny and cathartic. Then, the end boss casually tosses out that tired old Dark Knight Rises "you merely adopted the whatever, I was born in it" meme.\n\nIt acknowledges that referential humour is not funny, AND THEN KEEPS DOING IT ANYWAY.\n\nMusic is alright though.","December 20, 2014","false","2.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/recommended/230050/","wrath-","Wrath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/","145 products in account","I've thought about this for significantly longer than this game deserves and have come up with a couple of conclusions on what I think of it.\n\nYou're just not going to get Upton Sinclair's The Jungle in the 21st century, certainly not some type of work that makes people reevaluate what they're doing, what they're giving, and what they're getting in return. So a satirical game like this with seemingly good intentions, created to poke fun at a poor industry practice is likely the only way to make a strong political statement, at least one that gets any attention. The fact that DLC Quest came from Greenlight makes it all the better.\n\nHowever, I'm not recommending this game for several reasons.  The primary reason is that it's just not very good. Gameplay is very Super Mario Bros: Sidescroller, very rudimentary exploration, spend most of your time collecting coins, there's something about a princess. Part of the impact of the satire is more or less aimed at this similarity. There's an unspoken message that says, essentially, "imagine this is the late 80s, early 90s and you can't even have sound because Mario was made by Ubisoft". That's an amusing concept on paper and an arguably effective way to make your statement, but it's not all that enjoyable to experience.\n\nQuests in this game have to live within that Mario framework, balance simplicity, but also try to tell a basic story that further supports the dev's point. The result is endless hide and seek coin collecting and busywork tasks that prolong the time you have to play the game and delay the hour you'll put it down. Yeah, that's basically what all quests in all games do, but they're typically more interesting an involved than "travel to the other side of the map and press E. Travel to the other side of the map again and press E." When the top two rarest achievements in the game are "do the entire thing again - but faster!", you get an idea of what you're getting into. Ultimately, there are two ends you can reach with this playstyle. The first is that the dev doesn't know what quests are or how to make enjoyable "meat and potatoes" content for a game (which is likely), or the dev is making a larger statement that 90% of real life is collecting coins and busy work (which is naïve - look, I have time to both play this game and criticize it! :P).\n\nOne other reason that I'm not much of a fan of it is that this is marketed as a full-fledged video game. In 1985, if it wasn't a satire game and had different theming altogether, it would still be decidedly short on content. You can finish this in two to three hours. Today, it's easy to make a game of this quality and spam them out on the internet. This is how Miniclip and other flash game websites are alive.\n\n\nNow, with that in mind, I'm going to list some of the top-rated reviews for this game:\n\n"You can buy more DLC than Borderlands 2 has. 10/10" - Hammercorps\n\n"Download the Review DLC to access this review." -GmCity\n\n"Had to spend extra to pause the game. 10/10" - Fatal'z Nutz\n\nThat's it. Those aren’t snippets, those are the full reviews. Indicated by the fact that these, among others, are top reviews, the basic atmosphere of DLC Quest feedback is basically "I agree with this game's premise" and "Gosh, I don't know, I just like it". This is actually not far removed from how DLC, itself, is marketable. Notwithstanding publishers that pride themselves on actual expansions to a game, which introduces 30-50% of the initial content they originally didn't intent on developing, let's take more rampant publishers as an example.\n\nLet's take a game like Crusader Kings II, published by Paradox Interactive, which is a lovely game by the way, although it suffers from rampant DLC release. As of February 2015, there are 52 DLC items which includes four major additions, two ebooks (of all things) seven music additions, and 39 glorified reskins of ruler clothes or soldier uniforms. Why do people purchase these things? Basically, for the same reason behind the reviews for DLC Quest. They agree with the premise of the original game...plus a healthy mix of "I just feel empty inside without it".\n\nSo really, by marketing a flash game as a full fledged video game, at a DLC price, with a satirical premise, Going Loud has actually (rather impressively) created a game that functions as DLC normally would. As a result, they've published very little content, but to an extraordinary amount of profit.","February 22, 2015","false","1.9"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","12","24","2","1"

I've definitely spent a dollar and some change worse (sale), but I've also done better, so while this isn't the absolute worst thing you can throw your money at, I wouldn't do it again.

For starters it's less of a game than it is a walking parody of (modern) gaming and its tropes, with some platforming and light puzzle solving / fetch quests sprinkled in. There's a horse armor joke. There are hats to collect. Yes, there's even a Markus "Notch" Persson reference involving a pickaxe.\nThe humor is strongest during the game's first "campaign", which can be finished in 30 minutes to over an hour depending on your playstyle. After that, any charm DLC Quest had evaporates, as its slightly novel gameplay becomes a grind in order to progress. Full disclosure: it has been some time since I've played my copy, and there may be some things I'm misremembering or skipping altogether. But the feeling remains with me: this game did not need a second half.\n\nShould you buy DLC Quest? For the price, it is hardly something to fret over. You could spend $2.99 on -ACTUAL- DLC and be more disappointed. But because the jokes are so easy, and the fact that it's just repackaged internet humor, prevents me from fully endorsing this title.","December 11, 2013","false","1.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Anyway today we have DLC Quest, yes thats right D.L.C Q.U.E.S.T, not Pluto nash 69D. Now you know when they say dont judge a book by its cover well that really doesnt apply here because it literally says it all in the f**king title. You start off as a pleb, scurb little mormon boy named AlecJackSpecticTank who finds himself in a twisted yet literal world of DLC(DonkeysLikeCock). Your best friend is, well the shop. And if thats not sad enough your forced to buy dlc to play the game, even though its not real money/steam wallet money its f**king stupid in my opinon, not to hate or anything. The game is an fast paced Moba that really sets the bars as to what the pc can do, with only like 3 resolutions and like 4 other settings this game really takes advantage of the pcs capability Also did i mention it only lasts liek 30min-1hr. Secondly the gameplay, well there is not much to other than your forced to buy the jump and move LEFT, thats right move left like wtf. If thats not bad enough your better off spending your money on opening a case on csgo or tf2. Even though some may respect it for what it is i think even gaben would agree that this is a -69/100 on the metacritic, not only that but this game makes bad rats look like gta on max settings. This game is so BAD i mean gud that it gives autism and up syndrome to every 1-10 ppl, so count your family and divide by 2 x your friends and gabens left nut = your 420% of gettings one of 69 dieseases and disablities. In the end if you made it this far if your thinking of purchasing this game check with Alec Dryer, if you played this game uninstall and become amish, and finallly if your bought this game make sure you thank your fellow peruvian dota player for not laughing at you and always thank shrek and the rat gods for giving you the blessing of slipping on tht D.... for DLC","September 25, 2015","false","1.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

The game is short, taking around 2-3 hours to play both episodes (though it's been done in far, far less), however the pacing is good, keeping things entertaining and even challenging at times without becoming frustrating. Gameplay is tight and competent, complimented by good control and level design.

DLC Quest, however, manages to be even WORSE in this regard, because its core premise has no progression even built in; it's literally one overextended joke about how much AAA publishers contempt for the consumer comes out in their handling of Downloadable Content for published titles, and in fact it's not even that sophisticated. Much as the game itself is only £2 (65p at time of writing) the fact is that without charging actual money for DLC the game loses any real investment a player could have in the satire it's peddling because there's an absence of the actual tangible effect of the relatable concept; but it can't do that because doing so would undermine its stated political standpoint. The idea was doomed from the start and in terms of realisation of that foretold failure DLC Quest, like Evoland before it, does not disappoint.","December 21, 2013","false","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have no intentions of playing this anymore but I just want people to know that if you really want to enjoy this game you have to sink more than 30minutes of mindlessly going to things pressing the action button to "buy more dlc" while listening to mindnumbingly poor 8bit tracks that repeat over and over again (I presume that you'll be given an option to "purchase better music" further on in the game) and constantly backtrack trying to collect coinss to purchase more dlc.\n\nThe concept of this game is as you should know by the game trailer to buy dlc. The game developers did exactly that and I would give them a 10/10 for that.\nThe score for 'enjoyability' 0/10 and it's cause this game does nothing unique or special from other 2D adventure platformers besides having the player purchase a ludicrious amount of ♥♥♥♥ for the game.\nThe score for the story is 1/10. The story is a generic save the princess scenario and is nothing unique as well as the writing for the npcs feel lazily written.\nBy the way you can't skip 'cutscenes' which are basically powerpoint slide transitions so I had a blast with those as well.\n\nUnless you are willing to sink more than an hour of what I've stated above, I would recommend that you save your money and buy a coffee or something else useful to you and bask in the glory that you didn't waste time like I did.\nFeel free to downvote this and buy the game and see for yourself what the game's about. I might be wrong about all of this but I don't want to waste anymore time playing a game that I feel is a waste of time and money.\n\nPs: Please note that this is not a professional review of DLC Quest. This is mearly a rant from a guy you might not see ever again. If you are looking for a legitimate review I highly recommed that you look to youtube for professional reviews.\n\nIf you read all of this or just skipped to the bottom of this post I must commend you for your patience (or scrolling skills).\nHere are 2 gifs for your troubles.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/C7Gpo9K.gif\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zAuxnTw.gif","January 31, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's like explaining to your friend that doing crystal meth isn't good, by doing crystal meth yourself and showing him disastrous results.\n\nSome of the "DLC" aren't humourous but just plain annoying.
