There are some things that potential players of the game should be aware of before purchasing however, as they may dramatically effect enjoyment of the game:\n\n1. The art style of the game, it really worked in some respects (Such as the Harveys/demons) but in other respects it was kind of lacking, such as the mouth animations of the characters.\n\n2. Some of the puzzles in the game require a large amount of discrete math, so I hope you took a class in it in your undergraduate.  Break out the truth tables! You can skip all of these puzzles though.  I recommend trying your hand at them though if you have a familiarity with these sort of logic puzzles.\n\n3.  Acheivements straight up arn't working as of 11/28/13.  If you're an acheivement ♥♥♥♥♥ like myself, this will disappoint you, and reduce your game completion % if you're keeping track of that.\n\n4.  Not so much a problem, but a warning.  Art style notwithstanding, this ain't a kid's game.  Were this game a movie, I'd rate it R.  I wouldn't even recommend playing this in the same house as a kid.\n\nThat said, even with those caviats, the game is worth playing because:\n\n1.  The dark humor of the game is done well.\n\n2.  Solid endings\n\n3.  Most of the use thing on thing puzzles are fairly straightforward.\n\nAnyway all told, I enjoyed it, you might too.","November 28, 2013","true","7.0"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","50","52","0","0"

At first the violent scenes are somewhat "censored" (you'll see what I mean) but gore is still strongly suggested and even censored some scenes can be deeply disturbing, even if presented in a humorous way. Later on the violence gets more graphic. So IMHO, ---definitely--- not intended for kids.\n\nAlthough the story and script are great and the game's biggest strength, I feel like the ending(s) were a little rushed. They should have extended them more, explain some stuff and make each of them longer and more unique. It was kind of disappointing, but I still recommend it since it's only the last 5 minutes of the game that I didn't love.\n\nIt actually lasted me around 8 - 10 hours of real game time.","February 26, 2015","true","14.6"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","25","31","5","0"

For a graphic adventure it has a good story, humour...creepiness... It uses the mechanics offered by the storyline well. Really it's so fun I don't want to say more for fear of adding in too many spoilers. I would love to recommend it without reserve.\n\nBut...\n\nIt suffers from some technical issues, inventory items that float in mid air while the inventory is closed, screen juddering and of course a couple of times where the game actually lapses into German (I was playing in English), and weirdly I would have forgiven all of that except that somewhere along the line (apparently in a patch a couple of months back) they broke all the achievements.\n\nIt's still well worth the price they are asking - none of the in game glitches are game breaking or anything more than an occasional annoyance, but if you're expecting a completely smooth experience with a bunch of achievements to collect you will be disappointed.\n\nEdit: I went back to this after it had been updated a couple of times and reportedly fixed the achievements and some of them worked... but not all.

It’s light in style, yet dark in humor.  It is silly, funny, doesn't frustrate, and has some fun and challenging puzzles.  It is the kind of game that true fans of the genre will adore, casual fans of the genre should enjoy, and indifferent fans of the genre may welcome.\n\nI find myself saying the following about many of Deadalic’s adventure games: what really gives the game a quality above the par is the atmosphere of the game.  The music, the art style, the characters, the dialogue, the humor, the game mechanics... it all blends together into a charming, unique, and very enjoyable experience.\n\nThe game plays with classic point-and-click mechanics.  It is a strongly story-driven experience with a lot of dialogue.  There are inventory based puzzles, dialogue based puzzles, and minigame style puzzles that must be solved to progress the game.  Some of the puzzles are pretty challenging because the solutions don't really make sense logically— but they make sense within the confines of the twisted reality of the game.  While a feature like that can be frustrating at times for adventure gamers, I think it fits in perfectly with this game.\n\nAs I alluded to, there's a real lot of dark humor in this game and it fits the atmosphere perfectly. It isn't a kid's adventure game.  Even as someone who truly enjoys adventure games, I sometimes find myself bored with their trivial, childish storylines; with Edna & Harvey: Harvey’s New Eyes though, I truly enjoyed the hilarious story from beginning to end.\n\nSimply put: what makes this game great is the way it perfectly blends classic, nostalgia-inducing, childish adventure gameplay with adult themes and dry, dark humor.  If you are an adult that enjoys adventure games, and are craving a good experience, then you should check this game out.  And if you have been on the fence about trying an adventure game, this is a pretty good one to play to get a taste of what the genre can offer.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","February 14, 2014","true","11.3"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","0"

Apparently, it's a sequel to "Edna & Harvey: The Breakout."  But, it's independent enough to be played stand-alone.  Because of the age of the main character and some implications from the narrator right at the start, you might be tempted to consider this to be a child's game.  It's not.  It's an adult's game hiding slightly behind a childlike irony.  I bought it on sale for about $4 and that's a no-brainer of a purchase.  Absolutely worth that. I'd say it would still be well worth it at around $10.  It's current list price of about $20 might be a bit high, though.\n\nI do have some issue with the game, too.  First, it's slow to play.  But, that's endemic to these point-and-clicks since you've got to watch the character walk around, interact with the world, and converse.  Mitigating that is the saving grace that a lot of that kind of thing can be ESCaped out of or clicked through.  Second, some of the puzzles are not exactly obvious in what they want you to do.  This is especially true with the mini-games embedded in it.  Heck, the "solutions" from two of those mini-games were still obtuse enough to be of no use to me in the game proper.  And, finally, a lot of the achievements are royal pains.  They're not achievements that enhance gameplay.  Instead, they're of the form of "do some pointless activity enough times for me to say "you win."  But, all-in-all, it's a very good game.","December 31, 2014","true","16.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

It was bundled with another Daedalic game that I wanted, but I decided to give it a try and 1 hour into gameplay I concluded that if this game manages to keep similar brilliant mood and humor to the final credits, I will madly fall in love with it. In the end it didn’t, but still it is my favorite game from this studio so far. Now, that you know my opinion on the subject, let me tell you that you really should not read this mini-review since perhaps this game is best approached like a typical Daedalic point and click …\n\n…still reading this? …\n\n…you’ve been warned…\n\n…because  it is not the studio’s most typical game.  Sure it retains all the mechanisms this genre is known for, still it seems to be bad at what most Daedalic games are good (2d art) and brilliant at everything else .\n\nThe game’s story, narration and voice acting are among the strongest I’ve seen in a point and click during the last few years.  I won’t describe the plot here (not to tell too much, and you’ve got it covered on the game’s Store Page). Instead let me focus on the narration. While Lilly ( the protagonist) does not say a single word throughout the entire game (or does she … ?) the narrator does an OUTSTANDING job constantly commenting on her actions and motives, brilliantly combining the innocence of child’s perspective with the games quite sadistic sense of humor.\n\nRegrettably, the game’s 2nd and 3rd chapters feel slightly weaker than the beginning and conclusion.  As far as I know the game has three endings (two of them good, while the third one … truly awesome). A very strong 8 out of 10.\n\n\nPL\n\nEdnę i Harvey’a kupiłem przez przypadek. Był w paczce z inną grą z Daedalic w którą chciałem zagrać, zdecydowałem się jednak dać jej szansę i po pierwszej godzinie miałem wrażenie że jeżeli gra utrzyma atmosferę i humor do napisów końcowych, zakocham się w niej bez pamięci. Nie udało się, ale mimo to stała się moją ulubioną pozycją ze studia Daedalic (a ukończyłem już kilka…). A teraz, skoro już znasz moją opinię najlepiej zrobisz nie czytając dalej tej mini-recki bo w Harvey’s New Eyes gra się  najlepiej kiedy spodziewasz się typowo Daedalicowej przygodówki …\n\n..dalej to czytasz?...\n\n..ostrzegałem…\n\n… bo Edna and Harvey nie jest do końca typowym dla tego studia point and clickiem. Zachowuje wszystkie mechanizmy właściwe tego typu grom, ale grafika odstaje od tego do czego przyzwyczaili graczy ludzie z Daedalic’a. Za to voice acting (zazwyczaj tragiczny w grach tych twórców) jest jednym z najlepszych jakie słyszałem od lat, muzyka idealnie pasuje do klimatu gry (rewelacyjny temat z napisów końcowych!) zagadki są ciekawe, pomysłowe … i bywają trudne (niektóre zwyczajnie przekombinowane, inne po prostu rewelacyjne).\n\nFabuły nie będę zdradzał (a co, jest opisana na stronie gry) powiem tylko że razem z narracją stanowią największą zaletę tej gry. Lilly (postać sterowana przez gracza) nie wypowiada nawet słowa  (chociaż … nie, nic nie powiem! ), za to narrator ciągle komentuje jej poczynania i intencje. I trzeba powiedzieć że robi to w sposób naprawdę GENIALNY. Narracja zgrabnie łączy niewinność perspektywy z jakiej patrzy dziecko z (BARDZO) morderczym humorem jakim ocieka gra.\nSzkoda że rodział drugi i trzeci są odrobinę słabsze od pierwszego i rewelacyjnego finału gry (z tego co udało mi się odkryć są trzy zakończenia: dwa solidne i jedno … doskonałe). Podsumowując: bardzo solidne 8/10.","March 20, 2014","true","9.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

At least in German, it’s absolutely delicious. It made me think of giving a ghastly report on a horrific accident with the voice a dad would read a bedtime story to his 4 year-old little girl.\n\nThe beginning was like any other point-and-click game. I was this sweet shy little girl in a convent-school, doing this and that and the other… and suddenly I was staring at my screen with eyes opened like two fried eggs, jaw dropped, my mind blown, exclaiming “WTF! Did that just actually happen? WTF!” (My partner, who had been watching me play, laughed his a** off exclaiming “holy sh*t!”). That sent me to one of the most surreal, fantastic, incredible adventure games that I’ve played. I’m glad it was a rainy Sunday, because I just couldn’t stop playing until it was over. I loved every minute of it.\n\nMost “puzzles” are actually “collect stuff, combine/use”, but it has a couple of pretty cool mini-games.

The sequel of Edna & Harvey is still a lot of fun to play for any casual and hardcore adventure game fan, but only if you are not the type who gets disturbed easily.\n\nLong version:Edna & Harvey: Harvey’s New Eyes is more of a spiritual successor to ‘The Breakout’ than an actual sequel, even though you will see many familiar faces and places throughout the story.\nFrom a technical standpoint, it is closer to Deponia: same engine, same user interface, similar multi-chapter story structure and difficulty. This also carries the advantage of using more refined point ‘n’ click mechanics for the small price of sacrificing the charm of a well-made indie game that made ‘The Breakout’ so charismatic.\n\nOne of the most defining features of this game is the humour– humour darker than the core of a black hole. Seriously. If you get disturbed about children dying gruesome, horrible deaths, don’t ever buy this one. It may look cartoonish, but that is just one of the clever tools to make the player feel uncomfortable. Another is the narrator who does a perfect job of telling a seemingly innocent tale about a little girl in a way that sends shivers down your spine.\n\nThe writing is excellent. Yes, it is disturbing in many places and it is disturbingly cruel with most of the cast, but the characters also fit in their role in the plot perfectly.\nIt’s the small things though that shows the brilliance. Things like not letting the protagonist say even a single word in any dialogue yet still being able to carry meaningful conversations with everyone. Sure, it sounds insane to essentially cripple your dialogues, one of the main aspects of an adventure game, but sometimes being crazy works.

Interestingly enough, you don't play as either Edna or Harvey, instead playing the role of the young innocent schoolgirl, Lilli. But Lilli doesn't speak too much, and most of her dialog is filled by a narrator that loves to hear himself talk. Even though his voice acting is good, he all too often comes off as being melodramatic when it usually isn't necessary. The result is a game that tries to be funny all of the time, but only succeeds some of the time. The narrator makes every effort to lighten the mood, but his delivery is often dry and humorless and the intended humor often can't compete with the game's dark themes.\n\nThe puzzles were pretty straightforward. There were only a handful of places where it wasn't obvious what the next move was. Graphical drawings are nicely done and the story is well written.\n\nSteam achievements are broken.

I loved Deponia and The Breakout (the prequel to this) was pretty good too. However, this disappointed me. A lot.\n\nIn this game is the distinct Daedalic charm; when you laugh at a joke in the tutorial, it bodes well. But the charm didn't carry as far as it did in Deponia or even The Breakout. Maybe it's because Lilli isn't as interesting as Rufus and Edna are, maybe it's because she never says a word, maybe it's because the tone takes a hairpin turn at Dark Street. I'll explain.\n\nDeponia and The Breakout (to be exact it's Edna & Harvey: The Breakout, but I'll just shorten that) have amazing protagonists. Rufus is consistently funny and engaging and is genuinely relatable, while Edna is just loony enough to keep attention. Lilli, on the other hand, never says a word.\nYeah, she emotes a bit with her grunts and gestures, but silent protagonists are fundamentally character-less. Her thoughts are narrated throughout by an amazingly voice-acted male voice, but as she never communicates anything to other characters, they come up with flimsier and flimsier ways to say 'I know what you're gonna say'. It was clever at first, but it wore thin.\nThis brings me onto another big flaw over Breakout... The voice acting is overall pretty bad. Breakout had one of the best performances I've ever heard for Edna, but even she comes across poorly in this sequel. All the other voices sound silly, faked or are generally hard to listen to. That's pretty damning for a dialogue-heavy adventure game.\n\nThen there's the tone. Jesus. I read that this game comes across as child-friendly. This is barely adult-friendly. Just some of the events that take place which get passed off as background gags are horrific at BEST. I barely laughed throughout the second half of the game because the tone had dropped so dark that it didn't feel right. Child suicide. That's all I'll say.\n\nAnother point I should stress is that the puzzles range between discount Sudoku and actually impossible. Seriously. There was a logic puzzle that could not be solved with the information they gave me. Even the walkthrough I had to follow to progress couldn't explain HOW the information it gave was right; just that it was. And then another puzzle kept doing things different to how it said it did...but that one's hard to explain, so I'll just leave at that.\n\nMy issue with the achievements in this game may not be relevant to some people, but I thoroughly enjoy 100%ing Steam games. That said, this one was a chore. The non-story achieves are dull as anything; here's a little comparison to Deponia (which came out before this)...\nDeponia has you break physics by playing with electronics, meeting a past/future version of yourself and a special one for replaying the entire game with every word (spoken and written) replaced with Droggeljug.\nHarvey's New Eyes has you do a slow, drawn-out task 10 times, a different one 15 times, a different one 20+ times and one even 99 times. It has perhaps one or two references that don't feel like a brutal slog, but the rest...\nAgain, that might not matter to some people, but it contributes to my conclusion:\n\nThis doesn't feel like a Daedalic game. This feels like a fan-made game based on a Daedalic game. The underlying sense of humour is definitely there, but the tone is too dark, the characters too flat and the story too...bad. I don't want to spoil it, but it makes the previous game's story feel like it was a waste of time and boils the 'antagonist' down to a generic evil plot. Complete with a maniacal laugh.\nIt could also be a cheap shot (and a heavily biased one given my great love of the Deponia art style), but the art in this game felt budget. Perhaps they were emulating the art from The Breakout (the first game done by the studio), but I didn't like it.\nAlong with that there were numerous graphical glitches like the inventory not opening, the protagonist appearing in two places at once and the camera panning to the wrong place or just jumping about.\n\nThere were a few more bugs, but the bottom line is this didn't feel like it was done by the same masters of adventure games that made the Deponia Trilogy. Play them instead as they're some of the best of the genre. This is probably one of the worst. And that pains me to say.","February 14","false","11.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","13","20","2","0"

I wasn't expecting much considering the price was very low but I must say I was plesently surprised!\n\nPros;\n:: I love point & click adventure games & this fits the bill\n:: It's got a cute, hand drawn art style\n:: It's sarcastic, funny, slightly evil & very silly.\n:: It's surprisingly lengthy too - {took me about 7 hours to fully complete it}\n:: You have these "mini game" sections throughout the main game & it's handy that they do give you a "skip" button, so if it's too hard of a puzzle or you just can't be bothered doing it - you can skip it & it doesn't prevent you progressing further.\n:: The game has 3 possible endings - so it's cool you get to choose how your story ends {helpful tip - save when you're in the loony bin cell with Edna, this is a decent place to reload to if you're wanting to check out the alternate endings}\n\nCons;\n:: At times I did find myself clicking random stuff because it wasn't 100% obvious on what to do next {a lot of time was wasted & I did have to resort to a walkthrough for about 40% of it - for shame...}\n:: During cutscenes, although the animation is somewhat smooth - the audio is bad.  You can hear it juddering & skipping - plus this happens during gameplay too so it can get fairly tedious after a while.\n:: The end credits seemed to go on forever & having the main theme tune on a constant repeat was dire, even though you could click your mouse to speed up the credits - for me, this just resulted in crashing the game.  No disrespect to those who made it, they all deserve recognition in the credits but it would have been nice to have a skip option for those who didn't want to sit through them.\n:: The achievements for the game are broke, you're able to unlock the "fast learner" achievement if you skip the tutorial {recommended for second play through} but after that you earn no more achievements - so if you're wanting to play this game just for the achievements, i'd give it a miss.  After a bit of digging through community discussions, this issue has been broke for quite some time - so far there's still no resolve.\n\nOther than that I can't pick much fault with the game.\n\nIt's worth the money, it's silly, it's something worth wasting your time on.\nI only hope the developers finally get round to patching the achievements issue - otherwise they're going to have a lot of unhappy players on their hands asking for refunds, as something like that can really ruin the game for you.","December 17, 2015","true","8.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The forums also had people say that it worked when they reloaded it days later, so far it hasn't worked for me. I can't get an achievement for it so I'm not too bothered by it.

I enjoyed this game more than I enjoyed its predecessor. For one, this game was way more fair on the player! I didn't find myself looking up an online walkthrough every other puzzle. I absolutely still used one, but far less.\n\nThe black humor was way stronger in this game! Oh my. And I thought The Breakout was messed up. It was almost too dark.\n\nOne downside is Edna's role in the game is very small. She plays a minor character. I really got attached to Edna and way disappointed that this is really Lilli's game (and she doesn't speak which I didn't care for). Harvey however plays a major role in an interesting way. The good(?) thing about this game is that it could be easily picked up by someone who did not play through The Breakout.\n\nI finished this game in about 10 hours. It ended up being longer than the Breakout for me, which was very surprising because I thought The Breakout was quite long. After I'd finish a chapter in this game I'd be like, wow there's more?\n\nI had occasional problems with the restrictions menu not showing up, but other than that the game ran well.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes a point and click adventure game and likes dark humor.\n\nAlso, there are no jump scares that I can recall.","March 8","true","10.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The narration was funny and a nice dry tone that added to the charm, the enviorments I went to were drawn and created with such detail and looked amazing.\nThe story itself is also very interesting (No spoilers here), its a squeal to the original Edna and Harvey The Breakout, which I also really enjoyed despite that the way the inventory works was more annoying then anything else in the original, here at times it can be but I looked at both and here it was improved a bit to be less of a hassel. Also the animation and overall quailty of the envoriments was very much improved from the orginial and is now much more polished with richer colors and detail.\n\nI will say that the ending was a let down (in my own opinion) but overall if your a fan of point and click games and a interesting narrative with dark humor and a unusual premise that seems to warp reailty as you continue to play, then this is the game for you. I felt myself guessing the wholeway through about who my character, Lilli, truly was, I mean right from the start (around 10 to 20 minutes in) you something was VERY wrong with her, mentally anyway. Just from the trailers I had the feeling she was not a normal person and I like stories that are interesting and suprizing and this is one of those games.\n\nIt does suffer from the normal flaws of point and clicks.

First game where I screamed "hell yes" at "Do you want to play the tutorial?". I can't remember the last time I've enjoyed the humor in a new point & click adventure game this much, and I'd definitely rank it among the best I've ever played, and I've played quite a few.\n\nThere are some puzzles that offer the option to skip if you don't like those parts, and I find it a great idea .. some adventure games have had awful puzzles and being forced to play through them has really brought down the experience as a whole, though I've not yet had similar experiences with this game's puzzles.\n\nI've not yet finished the game and had to really struggle to be able to stop and go to bed, a couple of hours later than I originally planned to. I can't see how the game could possibly be ruined in whatever remains of it as everything I've seen so far has been great.\n\nThere are a couple of cases where the controls and hitboxes for interactable things have felt a bit off, but overall they're still among the best I've seen in similar games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/219910/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","TL;DR: Point & click adventure of seemingly innocent looks but containing dark humour and a grim yet wacky storyline.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This review is spoiler-free.\n\nWho the heck are Edna and Harvey? That was our (me and my wife) first question since we didn't initially know Harvey's New Eyes is actually the sequel to Edna & Harvey: The Breakout, despite having a release date preceding the latter on Steam. Fortunately it can be played well without knowing about the first game. It's definitely a nice game but like the main character, it's got issues.\n\nWho's who?\nInstead of Edna (who is your friend) you play as Lilli, a little girl being schooled at a convent school. She's depicted as a shy, clumsy girl who "always does as she's told". She's effectively a silent protagonist since she never gets to finish a word before she's interrupted.\n\nUsually in adventure games the protagonist thinks or comments on stuff that they see. Here this role has been reserved for the narrator. He makes snarky comments, describes what Lilli thinks and comments on every ridiculous thing Lilli tries. It's not possible to say more without spoiling it so suffice it to say his comments are masked by innocence but often tainted by the dark reality that Lilli seems oblivious to. We found the narrator hilarious, albeit repetitive at times.\n\nThe other characters are generally well developed, wacky caricatures of stereotypes. Some are batshit crazy - others are even likeable. The roster is large though often there's little need to interact with them more than a few times.\n\n"Why are you playing a kids' game?"\nIt soon becomes apparent that Lilli has some mental issues. Mental illness was the theme in the first game and thus it's appropriate to use here as well. The story plot starts out as a blend of a mystery and mundane chores, both of which lead to hilarious yet grim consequences, before developing into a kind of an escape and rescue adventure.\n\nArt style is simple yet colourful. Despite that don't go thinking this was a children's game just because of the bright graphics. They are in sharp contrast to the themes explored within. The themes are very adult and they involve mental disease, death, violence, alcohol, smoking and some other actions of dubious morale, more so than adventure games in general. This is not a bad thing per se, just not necessarily suitable for children.\n\nClickety click\nWhile playing we were menaced by a frustrating bug: when going to menu or alt+tabbing out of the game, the mouse cursor would stop registering either left or right clicks and oftentimes it would not open the inventory. This would be fixed only by revisiting menu a few times and trying again. It was mostly an annoyance though.\n\nOtherwise the interface works splendidly and it's a traditional point & click adventure game: left-click interacts, right-click looks at stuff. It's possible to see every interactable by pressing spacebar, which reveals that this is actually fairly casual adventure game: there are only a few interactables per every scene so it's fairly easy to progress even with the universal brute force strategy of trying everything with everything. Regrettably there's no dialogue for trying to interact with every object, so it may feel the game is unresponsive since one's expecting to get at least some response.\n\nExploring the game this way is prone to find all kinds of bugs if they exist. We encountered German dialogue once. Couple of times a cutscene would be skipped fast through like I had skipped it myself, and this repeated even if I reloaded the same scene. These were annoying but not game-breaking flaws.\n\nSolid game with some issues\nFor us the game lasted 15 hours containing completion, all endings and achievements. Contrary to many reviews, the achievements worked fine for us. Some of them are grindy and because of that hard to discover on your own. When you have to do some trivial interaction over ten times it really doesn't work well as an achievement in a point & click adventure game, especially since there is no indication or dialogue reward that you were doing it correctly.\n\nWhile the story is good, characters are quirky and interesting and we generally liked the game, I wouldn't recomend it at full price: I'd wait until at least 50% or 75% sale if you are not particularly into point & click adventure games.","February 8","true","15.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In this game you play as Lilli a nearly mute orphan trying to figure out what is the right way to act with so many people giving her orders.\n\nUnlike the first game, the story is told through the narrator instead of the protagonist and they will always have something funny to say even in the darkest moments of the game.\n\nSo if you're a fan of point and click games, like a good story with humor and can stand some chilling scenes then I suggest getting this game!","January 13","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's morbid humor and I love it! The narrator has that peachy GLaDOS-style negative-spin on everything. The voice acting is great with the dialog as funny as Monkey Island.\n\nThe art isn't amazing, but passable. I was never confused by any of the visuals. Having interactable objects 'glow' helps so you're not searching for every little pixel. Like the other reviews, the mouth motions really distract from the clean art. The animations are bad, but that's the only fault I can really find.\n\nThe puzzles aren't abstract, and the narrator gives you a lot of tips in solving problems. Some puzzles have you filling out grids, which flew over my head. Luckily, there's a skip button for them. I found myself able to figure out most of the puzzles if I really put my mind on it. I'm not the smartest person, so expert adventure gamers might find the puzzles too easy.","May 16, 2014","true","2.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It should be noted that it is a sequel; as a result, many parts of it will make little to no sense without playing the previous game: "Edna and Harvey: the Breakout."  I, being cheap, chose to watch a playthrough on youtube rather than buy the twenty dollar game, so that I might have context for this game.  I also have a few warnings about this game.  For starters, do not be fooled by the innocent exterior, this game is dark, extremely dark.  It may also screw with your mind to some degree or another, especially the ending.  The ending can be a no-win situation, unless you count the somewhat secret ending.  I'll leave it to you to figure out how to get to that ending.  This game differs from its predecessor in as much as there is a secret ending which can be considered somewhat good.  Despite the darkness and tendency to mess with the head, or perhaps because of it, the story is very good and well written.  This game is more than just a game, it is a story (in fact "Edna and Harvey: the Breakout" was originally a German university project on the topic of "The Computer Game as a Non-Linear Narrative Form."  In my opinion, both games accomplish the goal of proving the computer game as a storytelling medium very well.)  I know that most games need a story of some sort, but point-and-click adventure games depend heavily on the story, bringing it to the forefront, as opposed to FPS games, for example, where story can and often does take a backseat to the gameplay of shooting things.  As a result, this genre of games must be judged on storytelling more so than others.  Also, being a point-and-click adventure game, it requires the usual application of combined genius and madness to figure out the circuitous solutions to the puzzles.  While it is very good for what it is, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who dislikes the genre.  If your prior experiences with point-and-clicks range from "meh" to bad, I doubt this will change your opinion of them.  All of the above also goes for this game's predecessor, which I also recommend.  Finally, I would like to bring up price.  I have seven hours logged on this game by Steam, and I've beaten it.  So I would say 20 dollars is a tad bit steep, and would suggest waiting for this game to go on sale, if it ever does.  I enjoyed it, but I don't think 20 dollars is worth it, especially since point-and-click adventure games have almost no replay value.  There are other games for the same price or less that you could probably get more playtime out of.  So, to sum up the pros and cons of this game, it is a very solid point-and-click with a good, if dark and confusing, story, generally clever, if contrived and circuitous, puzzles, that, while generally fun, probably isn't worth 20 dollars.","December 8, 2013","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is actually a sequel to another Edna & Harvey game (also available on Steam), but I played this without first playing the first game, and I can safely say you don't need to play the first game to enjoy this adventure.\n\nIt has many of the shortcomings of traditional point'n'click games, including illogical "use item X on Y" problems and an annoying lack of an in-game hint system (EVERY adventure game should have one like Broken Sword 5 recently did!).\n\nNo, it doesn't try to be "modern" in any way, but at a time when Telltale has redefined adventure games and turned them into interactive movies, it is refreshing to play something honestly retro and honestly old-school.\n\nSome of the dialogue and humour is not quite as good as it tries to be, and some of the puzzles are a bit illogical, but overall this is a very good retro with gorgeous graphics and some pretty funny, dark scenarios. The best part about it is the overall flow of the game, the inventive dream scenarios and surprisingly touchy adult content. Edna & Harvey does not reinvent the genre, nor cure the inherent mechanical shortcomings in it, but it made me feel good inside, because it feels like a modern day reimagining of Day of the Tentacle, from which it obviously draws a lot of inspiration.

Still, the story was good and they added some good elements even if you did go around murdering a lot of people for no reason. A decent game though I wouldn't pay much for it.

As long as you keep your free will. Even if it means stabbing an old man in a wheelchair to death. The end."\n\nMy favorite ending is when Lilli contradicts Dr. Marcel. The first time (and not the last i bet) when Lilli actually says what's on her mind, she finally stands up for herlself. When she becomes furious at Dr. Marcel and everyone else in this damned world, it's such a beautiful sight to watch. You go girl! Finally, some attitude. The final battle with Mother Superior was cool, enough combos to try 'em out. Fun puzzles, too. Monkey Island reference when you get the Deja Vu achievement ("I think I've been here before..."). I got into the game when I were at least 3.5 hours in it, it gets really interesting farther so I'm glad i didn't drop it. Great credits song, you can see Bee-man enjoying his freedom flying. Finally, a character that isn't dead. Goblins didn't get to paint his corpse in pink. Sweet artwork. This game isn't as crazy as the previous one (less good old Harvey, less Edna, more Lilli).

It deals with a girl and she needs to solve problems that come her way. I find the game to be very refreshing and unique. Not to many games go in this direction and get the funny results that happen in this game. I did enjoy the story and the graphics are very colorful and have a very nice style to them. The music is also another plus for this game as its very unique and it sounds good. The game also has a narrator who gives you tips on what is going on. This is a breath of fresh air from a genre that I had thought had gotten very stale and dull. Bravo to this company for making a great game. I have not yet finished the game. The game is solid. Loads of fun so far.\n\nSo I have finished the game.. When your getting close to the end.  Around the 4 hour mark or so. Save your game. The game has 3 different endings. The endings were ok. However I feel like the game lets itself down a little towards the end.\n\nThe game has chapters in it. Chapter 3 was kind of weak compared to the first chapter that had me laughing and shaking my head. Riot Girl for the win... Haha.. Its a line one of the 2 popular girls says in the school. I still think its a good game let down by the writing towards the end.\n\nI am still glad I played it. I just with the other chapters in the story were are as strong as the first chapter.\n\nJust a heads up the achievments for this game are broken. I didnt know it had them till I looked them up.

It would have been my loss, because this was everything Deponia wasn't: puzzles that made sense and had a logical progression, likeable characters, and a deep interesting story.  Of course, it suffers from a buggy UI, once that was so game-breaking I had to reload an earlier game because loading at that point didn't fix it.  And it had several localization oversights, reverting to German in the middle of conversations.  The mental-block mechanic could have had some potential, but ended up being simply annoying.  If you were ever halted by a mental block, you'd simply switch modes and try again.  Those are relatively minor issues, though.  My only real gripe is the rather abrubt and unsatisfying ending to what was otherwise a very well done story.  I reloaded and tried the other endings with no improvement.  It was still a worthwhile play for the price I paid, and about 10 hours (making it comparitively lengthy) time well spent.","February 9, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With perseverance and the help of the game's Steam Discussions I did manage to finish the game, though I had to play through three times to get some of the glitchy Steam achievements.\n\nIn Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes, Edna is only a very secondary character, and Harvey doesn't even appear at all until a good portion into the game, although after that point he is very important to the story. His quippy remarks are largely missing, though, and there's nothing of the long-term relationship between Edna and Harvey from the first game. It's a big shame, too.\n\nInstead, we are given Lilly as the main character: a mostly silent 'good girl' who seems to spend most of her time doing what she's told, either by the grumpy Mother Superior of the convent where Lilly lives and learns, or by her friend, Edna. Lilly is a great character, charming and innocent, but I was a bit disappointed by the lack of involvement with Edna and Harvey, given that the game is ostensibly about them. That said, the tie-in with the characters from the first game was very well done.\n\nThe graphics are improved from the first game and are very well done. Sounds are adequate, and all text is spoken, some well, some not so well. I found the narrator's voice grating and unpleasant, which wasn't much fun given that it was the voice most heard throughout the game, and Mother Superior was terrible. But Edna and Harvey are both back and excellently spoken -- although quite limited -- and I also thought Lilly was superb. Most of the others were adequate, but forgettable.\n\nThe story is very different to that of the first game. Parts are very silly, while others are very serious, often hiding under a layer of silly. I think overall it was very well done. Puzzles are mostly simple, and there is a much smaller range of objects with which you can interact than in the first game. I didn't enjoy some of the minigames very much, but you can skip them all if you want (as long as you're not bothered about missing the achievements).\n\nI really liked Harvey's New Eyes. I think I probably liked The Breakout more, but this is still a great game. Recommended for adventure game fans, most definitely.\n\nWooooooogie.\n","January 26","true","15.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Without further delay, Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is a point and click game that focuses on telling a story (as most point and clicks do). The game itself is simple but sometimes it was annoying to get genuinely stuck without knowing what to do next. Through brute force, I was always able to find the next thing to do but sometimes it really took some time. In my honest opinion, the story was rather lame and I think this was meant for a much younger audience (5-10 year olds perhaps?). However, the voice acting was done very well and that is something that the game exceeded most other point and clicks on. Overall, I'm not a fan of point and clicks so I cannot recommend this game; but if you are a fan of point and clicks, this game should be on your watch list.\n\nRating: 6.3/10\nRecommend: Under $2.49","March 25","false","1.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","1"

Edna & Harvey: The Breakout is one of the best and funniest adventures i have ever played, and i played the Deponia trilogy soon afterwards on the strength of it, saving this one for last because i assumed it would hit the same heights as the original Edna. Instead it's a fairly boring adventure that has one joke centered around a main character whose whole life is narrated to her, and after the first punchline it already gets old. The puzzles are relatively straightforward, which was a nice change, but the story just doesn't measure up. It starts to pick up when Harvey makes a reappearance, but overall it just doesn't have the same soul or humor of either Edna or Deponia, nor the great pacing of A New Beginning. Not worth the time.\n\nEcht ne Entäuschung. Ich fand "Edna bricht aus" einer der tollste und lustigste Abenteurn aller Zeiten, und Deponia war ja auch geil, aber dieses ist voll langweilig.

There's a kind of twistedness to it, to Lilly's character that makes it disturbingly sweet. And unlike some others who have played this, I like the puzzles and the narrator's babble.\n\nHowever, as this is a review for the game bought on Steam, it fails. I scoured the internet and countless forums for help on fixing the 'broken' achievement problem, tiny bugs - I've tried everything that I found, but all to no avail. Some of the fixes, well, the game simply wouldn't let me even try them out...\n\nSome have said disable Steam Cloud, I did.. some have said delete save games and uninstall, reinstall, I did - nothing. One poster even said turning off Subtitles and exiting/ restarting did the trick for them - must be nice for them because when I try this, the main menu freezes forcing me to hard shut the game down every time - and guess what? The **** Subtitles option is always checked (even the ONE time I managed to exit the game properly and come back in, the Subtitles were activated).\n\nAfter vainly trying this, my 3rd time, I have decided to shelve it indefinitely on my Steam shelf and let it collect dust. Some may think it silly to not play a game simply because the achievements aren't working, but we all have our quirks. Not to mention, the main menu settings have some serious issues with being touched, freezing up the game in protest - this alone is severely annoying for me.\n\nBut the main reason I will not recommend E&H:HNE is because during my fruitless search for solutions, I discovered that Deadalic are not very catering to their paying public. Many places claimed the devs had stopped supporting some of their games on Steam altogether - I dunno, whatever that drama may be doesn't interest me so much. What I do know is that the achievement issue spans back more than two years. I received this game as a gift not even a month ago, and the problems are still present - despite some Spring-ish update only this year they claimed fixed this problem.\n\nRegardless, I will not buy Deponia now because of this experience, and probably nothing else Daedalic spins out. I have Journey of a Roach due to Koboldgames being on board - as things are going all right with that game, I suspect Daedalic mainly stuck to the publishing side of things - yay...\n\nIt is an exceedingly rare thing for me to have a bad experience with a game - when it happens, I'm unforgiving...\n\n-1/10\n\n\n**UPDATE EDIT 26.06.2015**\n\nSo, I got a new pc and have been in the process of re-downloading many games to try it out. Scanning my library, my eyes were caught by Edna & Harvey - this game has always been a bit of a constant fingernail scratch on the back of my neck... annoying and teasing. I was attracted to the story, art and gameplay from the start - but the hoop-jumping to find answers and the devs', largely, disinterest in taking part in Steam forums for their games and their standoffish attitude toward their playerbase was a turn-off.\n\nI did some searching again and found https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=228082874 which cures the Steam achievement issues. I would like to add that I did try something along these lines the last time I gave it a chance but it did not work (perhaps there were some remnants of the game left after numerous uninstall-/ re-installments to try to fix the problem and as this is a new pc...). So, I installed it, made sure Steam Cloud was off, ran it, chose English language, saw my version was 1.3.4.390, exited the game, rechecked to verify that Steam Cloud was still unselected, restarted the game, saw my version was now showing v. 2.0.4.0395, began a game and the achievements have been rolling in.\n\nThe game on its own has always been about a 9/10 for me, but I won't alter my recommendation because my feelings about Daedalic haven't changed. The jury's still out on if I'll ever purchase another game developed by them - it's the principal of a thing, it's principalities ;-)\n\nLook at the Edna & Harvey Steam forum... there are numerous broken achievement posts on the first page alone, THIS MONTH - why can't the devs sticky the link above and be done with it? It's crazy.\n\nAnd for any gamers who think other gamers throwing a stink about broken achievements are silly or whiney: Steam is an app for gamers with incentives to thoroughly explore most games and obtain rewards for doing so via achievements and perfect game stats - this is a game in and of itself.\n\nThis review was and remains for Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes, the STEAM version.","October 14, 2014","false","12.5"," 7 of 27 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","7","27","0","4"

You play as a little girl named Lilli at a convent school who has to complete tasks given to her by the cruel Mother Superior and attempt to help her best friend Edna. The story is good, the characters are interesting, and the voices are well recorded by good actors and actresses. The music is cool and sets a great atmosphere. The jokes are very dark most of the time, but if you can appreciate dark humor its a great game. The game lasts about 8 hours from start to finish. The only problems I've had with Harvey's New Eyes is a single German translation in the English version (also found occasionally in the Deponia games) and the fact that achievements are bugged and can't be earned even after reaching the requirement, which apparently is a very common problem.\n\nStill, Harvey's New Eyes is a great game and I highly recommend it.

Anyway, when I was looking into this, I saw that the forums were full of people complaining about not enjoying the game because the achievements were their main goal.

Harvey's new eyes unfortunately doesn't share all of the best aspects of the first game. In particular puzzles are much easier and less creative and too easy for my taste and it doesn't have unique responses to almost every action you might attempt as the first game did.\n\nWhat it does share with the first game is the dark humour and the appealing and very apropriate cartoon visuals. This is the main strength of the game, the darkly humorous story. Lily is a great main character, at the same time adorable and scary. The appeal of the story comes to a large part from the contrast between Lily's innocent appearance and the disastrous consequences of her actions. The general crazyness inherent in the details of the game world, e.g. there is a meat-eating plant in mother superiors office and there is a hamster equipped with night vision goggles who appears more than once to steal Lily's things, also helps keep the game entertaining as does the sarcastic narration. The unique style of the graphics are entirely appropriate and I don't think the game would have worked nearly as well with more "serious" graphics.\n\nSound effects are adequate but no more than that and voice acting is average. The music is fairly good but not exceptional.\n\nAll in all this is a very entertaining adventure game, although too easy for experience players and lacking the extreme attention to detail of the first Edna & Harvey game. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure games and dark humour.","February 2, 2014","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it proved to be a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe narration at first draws you into a storybook tale about the protagonist, Lilli, and sets the mood for what seems to be a rather childish and cliché story. As you continue, the dialog and narration slowly become darker, yet the game never loses its humourous touch. It's entertaining and engaging in the most unexpected way possible. The dark humour, in my opinion, is what sets this point-and-click apart from others.\n\nOn occasion, the game has potential for glitching (for example, my inventory items would sometimes appear to be 'floating' when I opened the tab), and the game starts out slow and pleasant at first, but the story progresses almost a little too quickly for my taste toward the end.\n\nOverall, though, I'd recommend this to any point-and-click fanatic who's looking for something a little different.

Usually I'm a huge graphic/visual snob, but when I saw that Daedalic had put forth this quirky and let's be honest, cheap looking game, I did a double take. I bought the game on sale and ladies and gentleman...\n\nThis game is kickass.\n\nThe story, the characters, the plot, and the unique game play was all FREAKIN AMAZING, FUNNY, AND ORIGINAL. The whole game embodies the term "dark comedy". Yes it's a point and click, but a point and click where you playfully murder bad children? The best part is halfway through the game, you think it's just going to continue being a point and click + murders + a few puzzles, but then it changes!\n\nBottom line: if you can look past the bad graphics and occasional game glitch (they speak german for like 2 seconds), Edna and Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is a game that you will love to death.

I can tell you that I was not disappointed. The humour, quirky characters, vibrant art style and catchy music that made the first game such a delight are all back in spades.\n\nIf you've played the Deponia series, you have probably already played this game. If not, I don't know what's stopping you! Also, if you're a fan of games like Monkey Island, I recommend this game. If you get frustrated easily, this may not be the game for you, as there were a few times where I had to explore and experiment before I could continue. But the objectives from section to section were usually well sign posted, and I hardly ever felt lost and unsure about what I was supposed to do, which leaves the emphasis on the puzzles.\n\nIf you're wondering where this fits in with the original game (something I was unsure about when I started playing), it does indeed take place after The Breakout. However, Edna is really a support character in this game, which focusses on a new character, Edna's friend Lili. While it's fun to see these new characters interacting with old favourites (Droggeljug!), it's also good to see new locations added. I would definitely recommend playing the first game before picking this one up, however this game can easily be played without the knowledge of the first game - some of the characters make references to the actions of the first game, and it just makes these references easier to get if you've played the first game. This game feels like it's a bit longer than the first game. There are three sections to the game, with the first taking up about half the game. In fact, I thought the first section was the entirety of the game, and was pleasantly surprised when the second chapter started!\n\nMy main gripe about that game would be that it's a bit disappointing that you can't get it on iPad. I played the original on my iPad and the point and click adventure genre is a great way to pass the time on the way to work. Also the controls are quite good, and I find myself pressing the Spacebar in other adventure games hoping to see all the hotspots I can click before having to remind myself that not all adventure games are built this intuitively!\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed this game a lot. Not perhaps a classic that will live throughout the ages like the Money Island series, it's still interesting and quirky enough to bring a smile to my face. If you consider yourself a point and click adventure game connoisseur, you need to give the Edna and Harvey series a try. I really hope there's an Edna And Harvey 3!","March 8, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","Lily is without a doubt one of the most awesome characters ever. She looks innocent, she barely speaks, sports a cute bow on her head and is a raging psychopath on the inside. What's there not to love about her? The innocently evil style about the character plays out so brilliantly throughout the story.\n\nI thought the story of the game was interesting as it has such a weird concept. It's not really something you can predict along the way and it also has multiple endings depending on what you choose. There are many moments where things are totally whack, but still in a good way. Especially in the second part of the game where you have to unlock certains traits for Lily, doing so by making her face some really weird situations.\n\nMost of the characters throughout the game, even those that don't have a lot of screentime, have very good and detailed personalities. It makes it fun to interact with them as they all treat Lily individually. It also adds to making Lilys character feel real.\n\nI didn't like the the artstyle of the game. I guess it's a matter of personal taste. Everything looks sloppily drawn and some characters just look weird when they talk.\n\nI am glad there was an option to skip out on the mini game puzzles in the game. I don't think I had the patience to sit through a single one of them. Most of them relied on being able to remember things and it's difficult for me having high functioning autism.\n\nI thought the voice acting was quite good (especially for a Deadelic game). I can't recall any actor that was outstanding, but there also wasn't anyone that was terrible. The only problem with the voice-acting is the narrator that just has too much dialogue when Lily uses items. As these kind of games require a lot of trial and error, hearing 4 lines of dialogue for one single click gets tedious. Sometimes when you do things wrong, other characters will also provide a lenghty dialogue due to it.\n\nThere are some bugs in the games, such as the achievements are at the time not working at all. Sometimes the inventory would lock and refuse to open, but simply walking to another room or reloading helped fix the problem.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game. It has a good sense of humor, great character interaction and there is also a sense of deep character development depending on how you chose to end the game.","December 24, 2013","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Harvey's new eyes unfortunately doesn't share all of the best aspects of the first game. In particular puzzles are much easier and less creative and too easy for my taste and it doesn't have unique responses to almost every action you might attempt as the first game did.\n\nWhat it does share with the first game is the dark humour and the appealing and very apropriate cartoon visuals. This is the main strength of the game, the darkly humorous story. Lily is a great main character, at the same time adorable and scary. The appeal of the story comes to a large part from the contrast between Lily's innocent appearance and the disastrous consequences of her actions. The general crazyness inherent in the details of the game world, e.g. there is a meat-eating plant in mother superiors office and there is a hamster equipped with night vision goggles who appears more than once to steal Lily's things, also helps keep the game entertaining as does the sarcastic narration. The unique style of the graphics are entirely appropriate and I don't think the game would have worked nearly as well with more "serious" graphics.\n\nSound effects are adequate but no more than that and voice acting is average. The music is fairly good but not exceptional.\n\nAll in all this is a very entertaining adventure game, although too easy for experience players and lacking the extreme attention to detail of the first Edna & Harvey game. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure games and dark humour.","February 2, 2014","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a great game with a good story, humorous dialogue, and a surreal ending. It grabbed my attention and interest early and held it for the entire game. The mini games are enjoyable too with a good amount of thought needed to complete them.\n\nJust a note to the achievement collectors; the achievements seem wonky where not all of them are triggered. It may need a second playthrough for them to activate, maybe. Anyway, when I was looking into this, I saw that the forums were full of people complaining about not enjoying the game because the achievements were their main goal. If that is the case and your goal is to collect achievements over game play, then be wary purchasing and playing this game.

In fact the graphics are slightly more polished. The control system is slightly more streamlined as well. One thing that did disappoint me was that despite being called Edna and Harvey, they have been demoted to supporting cast. The eccentric humour of Edna had Harvey have has been replaced by Lilly a small girl who says pretty much nothing and the fairly deadpan humour of the narrator. The game is still funny just different. Another disappointment was the achievements. The first game's achievements made you explore more of the game but the achievements here are for repeatedly clicking arbitrary things.

You play as a little girl named Lilli at a convent school who has to complete tasks given to her by the cruel Mother Superior and attempt to help her best friend Edna. The story is good, the characters are interesting, and the voices are well recorded by good actors and actresses. The music is cool and sets a great atmosphere. The jokes are very dark most of the time, but if you can appreciate dark humor its a great game. The game lasts about 8 hours from start to finish. The only problems I've had with Harvey's New Eyes is a single German translation in the English version (also found occasionally in the Deponia games) and the fact that achievements are bugged and can't be earned even after reaching the requirement, which apparently is a very common problem.\n\nStill, Harvey's New Eyes is a great game and I highly recommend it.

Second, the translation is pretty flawless, which was a concern because the first game, "Edna and Harvey: The Breakout", was panned because of poor English localization.

The game's characters are very unique, and the main character makes an incredibly strong impression for all the wrong reasons. Of course, this doesn't mean the other characters were any less memorable. There's plenty of miscellaneous dialogue to get lost in, and the narration is great.\n\nThe game length is decent, and I finished it in eight hours, although it is worth mentioning that I did it in one sitting simply because I found the game so damn compelling. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that chapter one was not the entire game, as I'd been assuming ever since I forgot the game actually had chapters. At this point the game introduced a new mechanic that in my opinion sadly wasn't used to its full extent (though it was still rather good). That's not saying the game was dragged out too long for them to actually use it enough, it's just that some abilities were one-time use.\n\nThroughout the game you're presented with different interactive puzzles, which serve as nice breaks from the running back and forth. For every puzzle, you have the option to skip them if you so desire, but I personally never did, because they were genuinely good. However, it's worth to mention that one of these puzzles was more of a trial and error game. This is something I realized very early on in the puzzle and it instantly sucked the fun out of it. Still, it was a really small part of the game and is honestly neglectable.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty good (especially the narrator's), although the rest of the game's audio is nothing noteworthy. That's okay, though, because the game's focus is its narrative, which it really delivers well on.\n\nIn short it's a story full of twists and funny turns, and occasional morbid curiosity. The writing is solid and the game mechanics work well, though there's still some to be desired. Top it off with some good voice acting and you can bunch this together with some of the better point & click adventure games out there.

However, it proved to be a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe narration at first draws you into a storybook tale about the protagonist, Lilli, and sets the mood for what seems to be a rather childish and cliché story. As you continue, the dialog and narration slowly become darker, yet the game never loses its humourous touch. It's entertaining and engaging in the most unexpected way possible. The dark humour, in my opinion, is what sets this point-and-click apart from others.\n\nOn occasion, the game has potential for glitching (for example, my inventory items would sometimes appear to be 'floating' when I opened the tab), and the game starts out slow and pleasant at first, but the story progresses almost a little too quickly for my taste toward the end.\n\nOverall, though, I'd recommend this to any point-and-click fanatic who's looking for something a little different. The mature/immature atmospheric blend may be bewildering at first, but in the end, it's entertainment that's well worth your time.","June 23, 2014","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Chapters two and three are simple in comparison. Particulary on chapter three you don't have access to the whole assylum. Seems most of the work went to the first chapter.\n\nSandly the end is abrupt, you don't get to know what happens to the protagonist, her friends or the antagonist. Even a page for a newspaper would have done it.\n\nGraphics are simple but ok. There is a glitch where the items in the inventory pop up over the screen when you enter an area, and you have to open and close the inventory for them to go away. The clicking area for many objects is displaced or too small, so sometimes you will miss them.\n\nAlso, I had to tweak in order to get the achievements: deactivate Steam Cloud (which activates another version of the game!) and delete all savegames. And one of the achievements makes you go again over the game, but skipping the puzzles.\n\nI more less had a good time.","February 29","false","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The humor is a bit darker, but there are varying types of humor for all tastes. A lot of the puzzles are just difficult enough and it wasn't too hard to figure out when or where to use an object to continue in the quest. There were unfortunately some parts that didn't make any sense; an area in Chapter 2 where you can exit to that the game doesn't let you go, a few puzzles that make too much sense in several ways forcing you to try to figure out what they're trying to get  you to do rather than just use your intelligence. (For an unused example, which of these doesn't match: Apple Apricot Plum Asparagus. One's a vegetable but one starts with P. Okay, so did you mean which one isn't a fruit or which one doesn't match alphabetically?) I didn't care for the fact that you could accidentally skip the text, either. Most games I've played display the full text when you click so you can read it instead of listen and then a second click will go to the next text so it prevents you from accidentally hitting your mouse and having to reload your game to figure out what's going on. And then on top of all of that the achievements don't work in this game and I contacted the company and they have no plans to fix it anytime soon.\n\nNow, even with a few gripes like that, I still enjoyed the game. The characters were very relatable, I laughed quite a bit, the gameplay was smooth and easy to adapt to, the graphics were exceptional, the sound didn't drown out anyone's voice (which is a huge pet peeve of mine), the music was amazing, and it was just so quirky and eccentric that I couldn't help but love it.\n\nAll in all, I'd give this game an 8 out of 10.\n\nThis is definitely something to add to your wishlist, but I'd say read up on it some before you make the decision to buy it.","March 1","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are excellent, and handle much better than those of the original game.  The best part relative to the original game (Edna & Harvey: The Breakout) is how a lot of the characters (asylum patients) from the first game are in this one.  The story ends a bit abruptly, and I would have liked to have more puzzles involving the restrictions and whatnot, since that was the best part.  I found I really liked the characters (I'm still sad that Capu died), but I think that Lilli (the main character) could have had a little more development...  and the name of the game is a little decieving, too.  It's called "Edna & Harvey", but it's more about Lilli, and the "Harvey's New Eyes" bit isn't as apparent nor interesting if you hadn't played the original.\n\nI don't know if this is the case for all users, or if this is just a bug in my game/steam/computer, but I didn't recieve any of the Steam Achievements for this game, even after completing the whole game and meeting some of the objectives I know were required to unlock the achievement.\n\nAs a part of the Daedalic Adventure Bundle (if I remember my transaction history correctly), this game has been pleasing, to say the least.

Nearly anything you do will be downplayed and rendered meaningless, again and again and again. Everyone is despicable. You murder kids, while feigning ignornace. Whether that’s a pro or a con is up to you, but it’s not really my thing.\n\nThis game has a slow start, but gets better with each chapter. It becomes interesting once you start chasing your demons and really gets going once you enter the final chapter. Too bad the end comes out of nowhere and just pulls the plug.\n\nThe puzzles and problem solving is for the most part straightforward, if you’re a bit flexible in how you associate things. The only nonsensical problem - to me - was the colorblind pizza thing. The clue here is to forget the whole colorblindness nonsense and see it as a color matching puzzle.","July 25, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Chapters two and three are simple in comparison. Particulary on chapter three you don't have access to the whole assylum. Seems most of the work went to the first chapter.\n\nSandly the end is abrupt, you don't get to know what happens to the protagonist, her friends or the antagonist. Even a page for a newspaper would have done it.\n\nGraphics are simple but ok. There is a glitch where the items in the inventory pop up over the screen when you enter an area, and you have to open and close the inventory for them to go away. The clicking area for many objects is displaced or too small, so sometimes you will miss them.\n\nAlso, I had to tweak in order to get the achievements: deactivate Steam Cloud (which activates another version of the game!) and delete all savegames. And one of the achievements makes you go again over the game, but skipping the puzzles.\n\nI more less had a good time.","February 29","false","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played E&H:HNY soon after I finished the Deponia series, which I loved a LOT, and I honestly have to say that I was slightly disappointed due to my high expectations of this game. That doesn't mean the game is bad. I just think it's not as enjoyable as the Deponia series, but it is still enjoyable in a different way nonetheless.\n\nThere was a sense of humour that doesn't click with me in E&H:HNY compared to Deponia. I find the MC in Deponia humourous because he is doing evil intentionally, because of his mischievous nature. The MC of this game is just an innocent little girl who... (trying very hard to omit spoilers)... cause disasters while having zero bad intentions, which ultimately ends up in a pile of regret for both the MC and myself as the player, and I personally fail to see the humour in that. I can say though, that the adventure was quite fun as and that there were a lot of enjoyable and interesting puzzles and mini-games.\n\nAll in all, if you like puzzles and you like adventures, I think that this game is worth trying if you can manage to get it in a bundle or on a discount, but personally it's not something I'd pay for at the retail price.","July 13, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I went into this game, thinking that I was prepared (I've read reviews about how this is full of dark humour, sarcasm, puzzles and whatnot) but this game had rendered me speechless right from the beginning.\n\nThis definitely isn't for the faint-hearted  and those who aren't comfortable with dark humour, and I find myself intrigued and unable to stop playing for the dark and twisted plot. And there are 3 chapters in total.\n\nI liked how Lilli (the MC) could only say a syllable word like "Um..." "We..." before she trails off and someone interrupts her. It's an interesting and unique way of characterising the MC and it also allows for certain implications and insights to be drawn from what kind of character Lilli is.\n\nThe puzzles were alright, but you have to pay attention to details and what was told to you. Some of the things were quite roundabout - you have to do a lot of things just for one purpose that I ended up forgetting what my goalwas supposed to be in the first place. That's just chapter 2 though.\n\nThis is definitely worth a buy, especially during a sale.\n\nNote: This is the second game, sort of a sequel to the first game (Breakout) but playing the first game isn't really important to understand this game. (PS. I didn't buy the first game)\n\nEdit: Although...

The concept and execution of the story and how you are pushed through the events was wonderful to watch and experience alongside the protagonist.\n\nThe premise is a simple one, you are a good little girl at a Catholic school who never speaks or gets the opportunity to speak who is always disciplined harshly and ignored.  The narrator, guides you - the player - through the story by telling you - the protagonist - what to do as a voice in her disturbed head.  Then someone tests a mind control device on her, putting more voices in her head commanding her to do and not do things.  The story grabs you right from the beginning and keeps you playing just to see either what will happen and how Lilli will reconcile all the voices in her head telling her to do this, not do that, argue with each other and make Lilli figure out how to shut everyone up.  It remains rather light hearted and veers into the dark without actually crossing the line.  I'd put it at the level of a Tim Burton film as far as how the story is written.\n\nThe voice acting, sound, and artwork are very well done.  Everything has improved since The Breakout.  The characters are all well done, the voice acting in the English localization is spot on.  The translation from German doesn't have so much Germanglish as the Deponia series did.  The art style contributes to the feeling of how messed up Lilli is, right down to the little gnomes censoring all the gore and dismemberment from her multiple murder spree and the narrator explaining it all away as coincidence or happenstance.  The scenery in Lilli's mind in the parts where she tries to break her conditioning are also out there, well done, and develop Lilly and the people around her.\n\nOne interesting thing about the puzzles in this game are the mental blocks Lilli has in her head.  As she breaks them, she break one of the rules at a time.  Which rule she is has broken plays a role in solving puzzles during the later parts of the game.\n\nOne thing to note, achievements are wonky.  You may or may not get them during your playthrough.  If that is something you find important, there may be workarounds but it's not something I dug into too far.\n\nThis is a fun little game about a mentally disturbed girl off on an adventure to help out a friend and clear out the mess in her head.  It's good fun and probably my favorite game in Daedalic's library.","November 4, 2013","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are excellent, and handle much better than those of the original game.  The best part relative to the original game (Edna & Harvey: The Breakout) is how a lot of the characters (asylum patients) from the first game are in this one.  The story ends a bit abruptly, and I would have liked to have more puzzles involving the restrictions and whatnot, since that was the best part.  I found I really liked the characters (I'm still sad that Capu died), but I think that Lilli (the main character) could have had a little more development...  and the name of the game is a little decieving, too.  It's called "Edna & Harvey", but it's more about Lilli, and the "Harvey's New Eyes" bit isn't as apparent nor interesting if you hadn't played the original.\n\nI don't know if this is the case for all users, or if this is just a bug in my game/steam/computer, but I didn't recieve any of the Steam Achievements for this game, even after completing the whole game and meeting some of the objectives I know were required to unlock the achievement.\n\nAs a part of the Daedalic Adventure Bundle (if I remember my transaction history correctly), this game has been pleasing, to say the least.

I loved the art and the story. The last mini-game is so fun. All the puzzles are easy to get through, but you may get stumped a few times. Don't look up the answers; just take your time and you'll figure it out. Really, one of my favorite point and click games.","May 1","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes I really love playing it, sometimes I get bored. The puzzles are pretty hard. I had fun times with this game that`s why I can`t click the no button. It might not be the kind of point-and-click game where you can`t stop playing, But I don`t regret spending my time on it.\n\nTo sum it up, I only recommend buying it ON SALE.","April 26","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Compared to the pequel this game reeks of polish and really shows that the developers are stepping forward. Even with all the improvements the sequel still maintains everything that I liked about the first and even uses it in creative ways, manipulting what you thought about the ending in The Breakout to keep you on your toes. The biggest downside I can name is that the plot is quite dependant on events of the first game which had it's flaws.","April 13","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
