If you're a fan of the source material you're going to buy this game regardless; and you should. However if you're not, there's nothing here for you.\n\nThe game was fun for a bit, but after I looked at the exercise as a gamer the core strategy is very simplistic. [Spoiler Alert] Hold the sword vertically and keep it between you and the bot. That's it! The gameplay gets a bit annoying when you're tasked to hit the bot 3x and then 10x. The physics aren't quite what you expect as you need to hold the sword tilted right over your head in order to get the lasers to shoot back properly. Also because the bot changes places quickly and randomly it's basically RNG until you get your 3 or 10 hits.\n\nThe sounds are what you expect them to be, but when tackling the later challenges it gets quite annoying; I just took my earbuds out after a while.\n\nFrom my day 1 playthrough I'd like to see a couple changes to improve the challenge and help me become a true master!\n\n2: Change Laser Colors: Everything other than blue and green swords are relativly worthless as yellow, purple, and of course red wash out the incoming red lasers making them hard to hit. That said I had to be a good Sith and use red anyway. Once you learn how to beat the current game it doesn't really matter.\n\n1: Multiple bots: I really don't see a way around this. If all the lasers are coming from one location all you'll ever need to do is just hold your sword in between that location and you.\n\nI don't really see a reason to stick with the source material after the first few levels anyway. Perhaps you could have the bot leave "mines" around with will detonate and shoot you after a set duration. Perhaps you could have turrets fixed to the walls to keep you in check.\n\nAlso I'm sure the physics do match up, but in the interest in fun I think some aim assistance in hitting the bot would be appreciated; Needing to hold the sword right against my forehead to hit the bot is not fun, or interesting, or even accurate to the source material. Perhaps introduce bullet time as well for some well aimed shots.\n\nI really want to thank the developer for delivering this, but please do tweak the experience to enhance the gameplay.\n\nThanks!","May 31","false","0.8"," 88 of 110 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","88","110","5","14"

I wanted to do THIS since I was like 5. I was lied to over and over. The wii promised an experience like this. Kinect promised an experience like this... But this... this is it. Finally. I can die happy.\n\nLet\'s be balanced here Jon.... okay okay... I\'m so excited though.\n\nPros:\nYou are controlling a mother ♥♥♥♥ing lightsaber that feels real.\nYou are now training to be a jedi.\nI closed my eyes and told myself to \"use the force\" and I actually blocked a few shots. It felt so damn, ♥♥♥♥♥in\' ♥♥♥ cool.\nMy friend today was like \"hey we should go hiking sometime...\" DUMB. This is how I want to do cardio.

Be that bad ♥♥♥ that your mom always told you that you were going to be.\n\nCons:\nThis is just one bland room and one experience. Granted,  the one experience I have always wanted the most from a video game.\nThey obviously stole Star Wars sound effects and it is only a matter of time before those awesome effects go away and this makes me so incredibly sad. Savor it while you can.\nThe bot stays in front of you. I wish it floated around in full 360. Let\'s use that room space dog. Space Pirate Trainer does it. You can too.\n\nNow let me be frank... I knew I wanted this when I bought the HTC VIve. I knew it wouldn\'t be long before something came out that would scratch this itch. For what it is currently... I would, personally, have paid $30 bucks for just this...(I even thought about reaching out to the Dev ahead of time because I was so excited)... but DISCLAIMER this is something I know that I have been wanting. I\'m sure that there are others. But come on, at 3.99... there is no reason to even doubt this purchase, You know who you are... if you think you might even want it a tiny little bit... It costs like the same amount as a big mac. This big mac is the tastiest of all the burgers you will ever taste in your entire life.\n\nTo the developer:\nThank you.\nHere are some ways to improve:\nAdd more diverse locations.\nAdd an endless mode.\nAdd a slow motion mode like Space Pirate Trainer.\nMultiple bots.\nUse a full 180 if not 360 for the bots.\nPlease make the blades interact with each other when they touch (haptic feedback and an animation is better than nothing).\n\nAgain, thank you so much. I don\'t know why it took for something like this to come along. This is a proud day for humanity.

If this game were made for non-VR it'd probably be sold for 50 cents or less - I consider the additional $3.50 to be a VR-dev tip (which they greatly need, given that the number of VR owners is so insanely low compared to the rest of the market).\n\nAnyway, with that in mind, I'm going to review this game as if it were 50 cents.\n\nPros:\nThe blades have a great Star Wars feel to them\nThe game is a fun thing to entertain a guest or yourself for a few minutes of down time\n\nCons:\nNot enough content to make you play this game longer than 20 minutes or so.\nBeatable in less than 10 minutes\nBlade glow is far too bright\nWay too easy (if the dev shrinks the hitboxes on the blades and increases the speed and frequency of lasers, this could be fixed)\n\nOverall:\nThis game is short and easy, but also fun and relaxing.  It's worth 50 cents, plus $3.50 VR tip.  My main hope is that the developer makes it harder, which would keep me coming back for more.\n\nNote:  I beat the whole thing in less than 10 minutes.  You probably will too. There isn't much content and it's extremely easy.  I recommend playing only on legendary mode and leaving one of your sabers off.  That makes it a bit harder, but it's still so easy I doubt many people will have trouble getting 100% deflections.","June 1","true","0.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That is great value for what you get.\n\nOk into the review:\nPROS\nVery very fun game imo. Great vr controls and great use of the haptic feedback when you deflect a bullet.\n(Light) Saber colours are cool but a problem arrises out of this.\nHilts (From the trailer) are cooolll\n\nCONS\nNot too much variety to be honest, mainly three game modes from what I have found so far, deflect 20-80 bullets, dodge the bullets and hit the robot with the bullets it fires at you. This can get repetative but as a counter argument: This game is only a few dollars/pounds, what u expect tbh)\nTHAT F****** HITTING THE ROBOT GAMEMODE IS INFURIATING.\nThe saber colours are too bright. You cant see the robot with some of the sabers, no joke.\nTHe hilts are cool from what I have seen from the trailer but are too difficult to get with the next one I need to get is from hitting the robot by deflecting the bullets 10 TIMES! WTF! (Please see third con)\n\nVERDICT:\nThis game is what it says in the description. Nothing more, nothing less.  While I have listed more cons than pros, the value of the first pro is high and is the most important thing in any VR game. The dev to improve needs more gameplay ASAP and should really not put hilts behind the defelcting bullets gamemode. The value is very reasonable for this game with fun gameplay.\n\n7/10\n\nEDIT: Saber colours are fixed","May 31","true","1.8"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

Finally the middle thumb decided to work.\n\nSecond, the lightsabers seem very thick and cartoony. Almost like a toy at walmart. I\'d recommend the dev look at some images on google and try to match the actual movie models. It\'s very hard to see because they are so thick also.\n\nThird, the blurriness of the demo. You can tell the dev left TXAA on in the post processing volume in UE4 and also did not set the screen percentage to at least 130 percent (recommened by epic for VR titles).\n\nFinally the lightsabers don\'t interact with eachother. I would recommend doing what Altspace VR does with their swords. Allow them to collide and stop the model there when the models touch, but your hand to go through in real life and it\'s fine that way. It works very well. In fact my brain natually just stops my hand when I hit the bar table with a sword in the HTC games room in Altspace. I was frustrated to see them just pass through eachother when I know very well it can be done (in fact I\'ve already done this myself using NewtonVR in Unity)\n\nAnyways, would not recommend purchasing this until above issues are resolved.

Except it's not.\n\nPros:\nYou get a lightsaber.\nShoot slow moving lasers\n????\nCons:\nThe gameplay. You start of with the Novice difficulty, and then advanced master etc. These don't change much besides frequency of the lasers and the robot moves around a little more. I'll expand on this.\nThe lasers. In novice it's pretty OK, learning the ropes. But after a little its just a borish task to hit the lasers, unless you want to go for imaginary flashy points and pretend your in Star Wars episode 2. I'd love it if they moved faster as you progressed, a real challenge basically.\nThe optimization. There's not much of it really. I'm running a GTX 970 and an i7 4790k and get massive FPS drops while playing without reprojection.\nThe menu's. They're OK-ish, It'd be nice if when you are hovering over a difficulty it shows you what the requirements are to beat them. [50/50 lasers hit etc]\nThe robots. Spoiler, once you get to the last difficulty it becomes mini games, first you have to dodge 10 lasers, each one shoots at like 8 second intervals, it's insanely easy to dodge. Next one is Hit the robot 3x! iirc. the easiest way of doing it is just point the "blade" at the laser and wiggle it a bit, it'll bounce back pretty accurately. The next one is hit the robot 10x, and then i quit and now I'm here.\nThat's all i can think of as of now. It's OK and i'll be keeping it since it was the low low price of $4, but there's a lot of room for improvement and i wouldn't suggest getting it just yet, waiting won't hurt.

True 1-to-1 "lightblade" motion mechanics in a game! The controls are pretty much on point. The physics of deflecting the beams could be a bit more consistent, but all-in-all, this is pretty much what every fan of the famous Space Opera has been pining for, albeit in very basic form.\n\nIt is extremely shallow on the content side. It features four difficulties that consist of deflecting, or dodging, increasing numbers of lasers, that also begin to increase in speed, and come from multiple directions. There are also seven unlocks that feature different colored blades and hilts. After completing the different difficulties, you'll unlock a series of challenges that allow you to complete your hilt collection.\n\nThe only real drawbacks are the lack of 360 movement, and the limited content. It uses the roomscale to allow you to dodge, and somewhat move around the room, but the droid never moves to the sides or behind; it always remains in-front of you. There is also only the one room, for what it is worth.\n\nOverall, I'd say I very much enjoyed this title (what is here), but the lack of some of the cooler potential gameplay wrinkles, and the fact that you can burn through it in less than half-an-hour, would leave me asking you, the potential buyer, these questions:\n\nWould you pay $4 to train with a "lightblade" for thirty minutes?

It took about 40 mins to finish the game and all its modes.  This game is great for those who like Star Wars and always wanted a lightsaber.  But this game can use alittle more mojo.  The rookie level is something to laugh at and the legendary can be done with one saber if you pay attention.  Shots come at you slow and most shots can be deflected by holding your saber in front of you.  There is also a mode where you have to survive 250 shots which at first was, I thought, to be hard but with the above comments this was rather easy.\nWays I would improve this game would be to:\n1) add troopers/droids that come in waves. You teamed with a squad that you can control with commands from the touchpad (selecting targets, giving individual soldiers an area to cover, using the grips on controllers as force push/pull etc.)\n2) make the lasers travel faster. Right now its like playing catch with a 5 year old. And add another bot for an even harder mode.\n3) this one is being picky but the saber needs to be faster when deployed.  Seems slower that what is seen in movies.\n\nOverall I still would recommend it. Its fun and can burn about an hour of time if needed.

There is only ever one droid and the laser bolts move very slowly, the hit boxes on the lightsabers are huge which meant I could kneel with them crossed and not get hit with minimal effort.\n\nThe game was very short - there were three (all very easy) difficulties and a few challenges at the end which could not be replayed.\n\nThe game was boring - the final challenge was to survive 250 bolts and since there's no progress indicator it felt like it was going on forever with no end in sight.\n\nOne other thing I found was that the lightsabers all washed out the screen making it difficult to see. Perhaps some adjustments to this could make the game more aesthetically pleasing.\n\nI am running on less than recommended hardware, and the game ran smoothly. However when using the steam overlay or recieving notifications the frame rate tanked and caused issues. For a game which is essentially a small room the performance is pretty bad, so I imagine this is not very well optimised.\n\nOverall I don't think this game is worth the money considering the other games which are availible, and I'd suggest you wait a bit longer until something a bit more carefully made comes along.","June 2","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I bought this game, played it for a few minutes, realized there was virtually nothing to do, and stoped playing it. Wouldn't recommend buying this unless it's on sale for $0.99, and even that might be too much.\n\nLong Review: Honestly, I thought I'd love this game. I'm a huge Star Wars fan. I've seen all the movies, watched the TV shows, and played most of the video games. So when I got an HTC Vive I was one of the many people who wanted a Star Wars game in VR. Sadly I can't even call this a game. The entire game is literally you, a lightsaber as your controller, and a training remote. That's it. While it was cool to pretend your holding a lightsaber and deflecting blaster bolts, the feeling quickly goes away as you realize there isn't anything else to do. There's no stoormtroopers, force powers, or anything really. I realize that this can't literally be a Star Wars game thanks to Disney and EA, but there needs to be a lot more in this "game" for it to be worth $4. I can't recommend this, even to star wars fans, because there's just nothing to do. This is possably the shortest time I've spent in a VR game. Really dissapointed. Don't fall for the hype. Wait till it's on sale for $0.99 or less, then you too can play it for 10 minutes and never play it again!","May 31","false","0.2"," 19 of 55 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","19","55","0","2"

It\'s a great experience and really hard for me to get by the master level, my son was able to unlock things for me though. It a little expensive at $4US at the moment probably more of a $2US game but what it does do it does pretty well. It could use some more content, depth and variety though, maybe add some pop-up laser cannons instead of the trainer sometimes, add some doors or computer consoles I can cut through, add some puzzles or more skills shots, double sided blades, maybe some other locations and enviroments for other levels, even outdoors would be cool, doesn\'t have to be an exploring game I\'m happy to experience each level in one place.

It's fun for the first 30 minutes - 1 hour.  After that though, it's too easy. Definitely worth the $4, but could be so much better if the devs make a few improvements.\n\nSuggested Improvements:\n- I want an endless hard mode like all the other VR shooters (space pirate trainer, holopoint, etc.).  I want multiple bots shooting lasers at me.  I want to have to dodge, and deflect laser back at bots to blow them up.\n- Potentially add a super-hard mode where bots can go fly all around you, and you have to keep looking around and deflecting / dodging\n- Deflecting lasers back at bots seems too hard. Maybe I'm just really bad at it, but it feels like you have to have your lightsaber angled pretty much perfectly to pull this off. You have to angle your lightsaber perfectly perpendicular to your target (both horizontally and vertically perpendicular), and have the laser hit dead center of the beam, to get it to go where you want. Too hard, find a way to make aiming more predictable / easy / forgiving.\n- New scenery / environments\n- Crazy idea:  Add a mode where lots of droids come at you, and you have to deflect lasers at them to destroy them, and chop down a few of the droids that get too close.

Like most of the Vive games so far, this is basically a tech demo while also providing a bit of a challenge and some goals to reach. For me, this game represents what I have been dreaming of since I was a kid: playing with real light sabers. This is playing with real light sabers. Are you battling stormtroopers or jedi? No. But for four bucks I got to play with a lightsaber and it was amazing! I have not gotten past master level yet because it is quite difficult, but it is so "realistic" that I keep popping in for another attempt. I really hope that these guys plan to push this forward into a full-fledged game. But in it's current state, it is absolutely worth 4 bucks.

And then I was made aware of this! Obviously it's the dream to finally practice deflecting with your lightsaber yourself. It's quite immersive, the graphics are nice, and it succesfully realizes the Star Wars theme. It's very simple, just blocking waves of lasers from a single drone. I find it pretty easy to do so, except when the glare from the last deflection overcomes my visual tracking on the next laser. I recommend you give it a try to feel the potential of a full-fledged virtua reality The Force Unleashed style of game – and play with only one lightsaber as the second is overkill.

Like me you're thinking how awesome it would be to hold a lightsaber, deflect incoming fire and generally be a Jedi/Sith badass. Unfortunately it's barely more than a glorified tech demo, not worth the price despite how low it is and in fact the first and only game I've received a steam refund. If this were an early access game then all would be forgiven, but as a complete package? Not worth the price. The issues are simple: Content, Difficulty and AI.\n\nThe core gameplay is simply deflect the laser bolt with the lightblade, so beyond that the unlocks are the only content worth talking about. The different totally-not-lightsaber blade colours and hilts mark your progression, which whilst nice add no gameplay value and would only be an incentive if the game was actually fun enough for you to want to earn them through playing the game.\n\nThere are 4 levels of difficulty, the first 2 so easy they are only worth mentioning for how boring they are, the third so inconsequential I have honesty forgotten and the 4th 'legend' barely a challenge.\n\nBeyond the sheer lack of content on show; 4 'difficulty' modes and a challenge mode is the AI, certainly the drone firing faster makes things more difficult, but the AI like the game as a whole is so barebones it tires quickly. The drone will never fire and move, it will fire 1-4 projectiles, move and fire again, there is always more than enough time to reorient between shots with no exertion on part of the player, it's patterns are obvious and predictable and the hitboxes large enough that a swing, or gentle point in the general direction will send the bolt deflecting into the wall.\n\nAfter Legend difficulty there is challenge mode, I read that this is comprised of several minigames, which I will assume is true as I never got past the second one. The first is dodge 10 lasers. Not only as simple as it sounds but even easier. The drone will fire, you'll move out of the way, read a few pages of a book and then the drone will fire again, you'll 'dodge' make yourself a cup of tea and politely move aside from the next laser bolt, and so on, with excruciating slowness for the next 8 times.\n\nThe next challenge is deflect the bolt back at the drone, very easy in the other modes since you would basically press the 'I win button' for every preceding difficultly level, which is to simply point the blade at the drone thus requiring only minimal movement to deflect every single shot without difficulty. In this challenge however, the drone almost always moves after firing and the physics never seem to stay stable long enough for you to figure out how to deflect a bolt back into it. You're supposed to deflect it back 3 times, I managed once, by luck. Perhaps it is doable, but I didn't really care at that point, it wasn't a challenge so much as an exercise in frustration as you swing your blade for the bolt to bury itself in the floor, on the opposite side of the room of the drone.\n\nThe game also seems to be designed to play with two lightsabers at once, which is weird since there was never a moment when I thought I would need it, and never enough lasers being fired for me to consider it would be fun to try. Indeed I started the game with one saber, holding it two-handed for the authentic experience and completely forget I had the other one due to the fact the aforementioned first three levels of difficulty had lulled me into a gentle sleep, the 4th waking me up enough to make me ask why I was still playing.\n\nI played legend difficulty twice, hoping perhaps I would find some replay value, but no there is none, the game is shallow and for the most part tedious. With more content it could be a superb totally-not-star-wars experience, but as it stands currently it's not worth your time let alone your money.","June 4","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
