You are given a simple task; seek vengeance on the four obscure gods of this alien realm and create chaos in the cosmos!\n\nKromaia has the fluidity and freedom of a 6DoF shooter like Descent or Terminal Velocity, a beautifully strange and otherworldly setting like Rez, the score-chasing arcade high of a classic rail-shooter like Galaxy Force II, all with incredibly creative and wildly original enemy ship designs unseen since the forgotten PSX gem Omega Boost. It doesn't just use these already perfected mechanics we've come to know and love over the past decades, it pushes them to the limits of modern gaming with dazzlingly bright and bloom-y effects intertwined with extraordinary physics at breakneck speeds.\n\nOn your initial run of the core playthrough you'll have each of the four distinctly different ships slowly introduced to you on each of the four base stages. Each stage has the standard goal of collecting 20 Jumpgate Drives before the keeper of the current realm is summoned and an epic boss battle ensues. This formula is spiced up each time with the varying abilities of each the four distinct ship ranging from your standard peashooter starting ship, a slower missle-launching ship with lock-on capabilities, a chaingunning plasma ship with a closer ranged needle laser, and last but definitely not least the insanely fun melee ship with sword swinging capabilities. After completing each of the four ships' respective stages, all levels will be unlocked in order to be played with any specialized ship of choice which is where the real freedom and your journey to the true ending begins.\n\nThe heavy and almost tribal beat of the background music drives you as you dash from piece to piece of your Jumpgate Drive, beating back the swarms of geometrical monstrosities that crowd you on every side. odd ancient structures with symbols scrawled across their sides are strewn about each huge world each containing even more secrets to collect. The surreal landscapes bend and twist in to complex patterns in the background and even more strange contraptions and diabolical obstacles are thrown at you the deeper you jet into the heart of this multi-dimensional dreamworld.\n\nAll around you is the extraterrestrial, mysterious and alien-like alphabet with cryptic symbols and strange whisperings of the motherly voice guiding your journey. The heavy and ominous electronic dronings of the soundtrack fit the abstract surroundings and hazy retrofuture feel as it builds up towards the climactic final boss encounter of each expansive and open stage. The whole atmosphere is thick with otherworldly wonder and a familiar neon warmth, giving me a feeling of nostalgic bliss not felt since that initial excitement of discovering the world of arcade gaming long ago.\n\nKromaia pulls off a blissful blend of technical and elegant movements of a modern shooter with intense and chaotic arcade score-chasing flawlessly for what is the most perfect package of abstract action. It feels like some kind of wonderful long lost Dreamcast gem brought back from the dead and given a whole layer of polish and shine, and for people who have fond memories of the era of gaming that I do this is nothing short of a must-buy, must-experience title","November 20, 2014","true","28.0"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","50","56","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bl1ght/recommended/285980/","Bl1ght","Blindlight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bl1ght/","84 products in account","Kromaia exceeded my expectations. This is not a strictly on-rails shooter like Rez, Starfox or Space Harrier. Think all of the above, with the freedom of movement of Descent: Pitch, yaw, strafe in all directions, boost, and barrel roll through a storm of geometry and AI that adapt to you. A 3D compass and level design that rewards your intuition keep you on track. Although the game is listed as third person, the view can be toggled between stationary 3rd as well as 1st person. The controls are intuitive, but also remappable. It's possible to ignore some axes for simpler handling, while experts can enjoy pushing the limits of motion or even customising the thrust physics. The plot is enigmatic and the immense soundtrack fits perfectly, guiding you steadily towards... something... the answer to an unknown question. The boss fights are creative and epic, reminiscent of Star Fox, and playing them with each of the game's 4 ships offers a different challenge (machine gunning the scales off a space snake is straightforward enough, peeling them off point blank with only an energy sword is another matter).\n\nOne downside to this game for some might be the length-- completion forces you to replay the same four stages with different ships, which although it provides a unique experience still feels a bit too small for a 20 dollar price tag. However, the score attack mode and editable configs the engine uses may be its saving grace and where the replay value resides, and hopefully official expansions are also a possibility. The boss fights are so good one is left wanting more space gods to conquer.\n\nMore reviews of 6DOF games in the spirit of Descent at: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/6degrees","October 23, 2014","true","7.3"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","0"

The developers are two very different people, yet they've found a way to merge arcade-like shooting and action with mythological-style storytelling. I would describe the game as a bit of a combination of three games:\n\n1. Galaga\n2. Descent\n3, Shadow of the Colossus\n\nWhy? Because it has the waves of bug-like enemies and shooting of Galaga, the six-degrees-of-freedom of Descent, and  grand bosses that factor as the main villains like Shadow of the Colossus did.\n\nYou play as a lost soul trapped in a spacecraft, woken up by a mysterious voice and sent on a mission to destroy four ancient gods in the false universes they rule. I like the approach to storytelling they took with the game, since it's unintrusive, but engaging and gives a sense of the scale of where you play.\n\nThe art style is also really compelling, if simplistic (but I personally love that kind of style). Colors are carefully placed and silhouettes are easy to read because everything has a distinctive shape.\n\nThe gameplay is one of the best parts! Enemies are very smart here, and will always move with you so that they (or you) don't get lost. They'll work together (every enemie has it's own "brain") to perform tactics like flanking, surrounding a goal, and pulling together in formations, possibly just to impress you.\n\nThere are some nice choices for ships as well. Between machine-gun fire, homing missiles for new players, lasers for snipers, and (here's my personal favorite) a ninja spaceship! The "ninja" ship actually uses a sword and shurikens to fight off foes, can you argue against that?\n\nMy biggest complaint is that there seems to be a few bugs here and there, but those will likely be patched out in the future since the devs care about their game.\n\nThe devs are also really great people and passionate about this game. A little support and the game's future will look bright, so please check this game out as soon as you can!","October 23, 2014","true","46.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","1"

It takes some time to understand, what exactly is going on on screen, as your flying through space, barrel rolling and pew-pewing everything in your way, but once you take your time, slow down and pay attention - everything becomes clear and you will have a blast.\nAs far as I can tell, there is a story mode and a score attack mode, where you can pick any of the 4 ships available. The ships are very different and offer different playstyle - from melee hits to homing missiles and precise laser pew-pew.\nThe fitting music, the tight controls and the 360° freedom is what makes the game so immersive.\nIn story mode there are 4 difficulty settings and according to the developers - adaptive AI, that adjusts to your abilities, ensuring you’ll always face a true challenge. I played on medium, had my fair share of deaths and cannot confirm nor deny the adaptive part.\nI would love to be able to play in fullscreen mode, but there isn't one (?!) or I can't find it. Also I would like to see some vsync option or a way to limit the fps, as the game is running rampant with over 120.\nOverall, I'm enjoying my time with the game, but I do find the price tag way to steep, so I can wholeheartedly recommend Kromaia, once it goes on sale.\n\nTL:DR or want to see some gameplay - check my video as I try to tackle the first boss\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=332704836\n","October 27, 2014","true","3.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeepbarnett/recommended/285980/","jeepbarnett","PersonGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeepbarnett/","715 products in account","Kromaia took me by surprise as one of the best games I've played this year. It's unbelievably gorgeous, its controls are tuned to perfection, and it's beautifully paced with a great soundtrack, non-stop action, and plenty of enigmatic secrets. I'd summarize it as Rez + Shadow of Colossus + Descent = something all its own.\n\nYou pilot 4 different ships, each with a different primary and secondary weapon system that impose unique play styles. There's 4 large free-roaming levels, each with a boss at the end, and your goal is to complete each level with each ship. In each level you pick up a linear series of collectables, but you can make your own path to each. Along the way swarms of enemies are trying to block your path.\n\nAlong with the amazing abstract visuals is an eerie ancient world, and you're being encouraged to defeat the bosses by a godlike voice that claims to be your mother. Giant mysterious monuments loom in the background and exploring them unlocks hidden areas. This type of environmental storytelling reminds me of Shadow of Colossus and Journey in its epic scope.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the game can start to feel like a grind, especially when trying to win with the trickier ships. I love the soundtrack, but since all the boss fights use the same music it starts to grate after the 10th time. But it's easy to forgive this problem when the moment to moment gameplay is so fun. You can tell this was a labor of love for the developers and that every bit has been hand tweaked until it felt right. It looks like they're still doing regular updates and I'm excited to see what they'll add next.","November 6, 2014","true","7.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

TL;DR:  Good game, but it's more like a $5 game than a $20 game.  I suggest waiting for sales before buying.\n\nThis review is based on the 1.0K version of the game.  There have been patches since then, so some of this information may be out of date.  The developers release patches and additions periodically.\n\nContent Quantity:\n- Only four levels and a "hub" map.  They're big but mostly empty.  It reminds me of like an old DOS game called Echelon.\n- Four ships to choose from, three unlocked by beating the first three levels.\n- And then you have to beat all other ship+level combinations, too (total of 16 "missions").  The challenge changes since the ships have totally different weapon styles, but it's mostly just repetetive.\n- I did two full playthroughs in about 11 hours.  A lot of that was hunting for secrets.  There's not that much content.  You can speedrun each level in 5 minutes if you just dodge enemies and go straight for checkpoints.\n\nStyle:\n- Graphics remind me of Tron - lots of glowing, solid, colored shapes.  It's typically much easier to see what's going on than what the store screenshots show.\n- I love the main theme music (main menu and orange level) and the boss fight music.  The soundtrack is stored in plain .ogg files that you can get out of the game's data folders.\n- I enjoyed the timeless, ominous and mysterious feel to the story.\n\nGameplay:\n- Combat isn't very interesting.  You have 6 degree-of-freedom controls, two weapons (primary and secondary) that change per ship, and an afterburner (which works in all directions, not just forwards).\n- You have a multi-layered shield bubble.  They have some kind of damage-per-second threshold, after which they pop.  This can be caused by enemy's weapons (which all glow in a specific color that you will know to avoid), or from high speed collisions.  Low-speed collisions typically will not pop a shield unless you're also struck by enemy fire.\n- Colliding with things in general SUCKS even if you don't lose a shield, because it will usually cause your ship to rotate erratically, disorienting you.\n- There is an unlockable grappling hook which is kind of neat but unusable for any real purpose that I could determine.  It's fun to mess with, though, since it follows the rules of the physics engine - allowing you to pull things or be pulled by things.\n- Enemies are predictable, but some are extremely difficult to deal with.\n- There is a boss at the end of each level, and all but the stationary one are well designed fights.\n- It's similar to a shmup (vertically scrolling shooter/bullet hell) but in full 3D, and instead of attacking from all directions which would be too difficult to deal with, enemies almost always move out in front of you before they attack regardless of which way you turn, making your ability to turn and move in any direction mostly meaningless.  It's not like Descent where enemies would happily shoot you from behind.\n- There are afterburner power-ups, shield restoring power-ups, secret collectibles, and that's it.\n- There is limited exploration for collectible secrets, but there is almost no point to them.\n- There is little to no motivation to kill enemies instead of avoiding them while speedrunning each level to kill the boss at the end.  Enemies are not fast enough to keep up with you and shoot at you at the same time.\n- The only things you gain permanently in the game are points and collectible secrets.  Points give you levels, but levels only decrease your secondary weapon cooldown (it's a very minor bonus that you won't notice change between each level).  Getting all collectible secrets give you a fifth ship once you beat the game, but that ship is currently just an upgraded version of the starting ship.\n\nBugs\n- I didn't encounter any major bugs in the game.  It's rock solid.","March 6, 2015","true","11.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","5"

That kind of recipe can often create flat impersonations, but I think\nin the case of KROMAIA the result manages to harness the simple “pew pew” fun of\nspace shooters in a very stylish way, if a tad bit unpolished.\n\nIf after the trailer you aren’t totally sure what KROMAIA is, it looks like REZ (or TRON,\ntake your pick) and controls like DESCENT, but combat lies somewhere between STAR\nFOX and a bullet-hell shoot-em-up in 3D. And you’ll quickly notice the story and world\nare pulled almost shamelessly from SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS.\n\nLooking at trailers makes the REZ influence the clearest part of KROMAIA, and the\ngame pushes this as soon as you hit the intro sequence and title screen. The slow mix of\none of the main themes actually reminds me of the original ZONE OF THE ENDERS\ntitle screen. The rest of the music hits a charming place that is usually somewhere\nbetween REZ and space games like DESCENT or FURY3. The part you can’t see until\nyou start the game is the COLOSSUS influence.\n\nYou’re greeted at the beginning by an entity that’s basically a cross between REZ’s Eden\nand COLOSSUS’s Dormin, who asks you in subtitled garble to go into four “worlds” that\nlook like both planetary orbits and computer systems, and kill four “gods.” From there\nKROMAIA lightly hints at some deep lore through both dialogue and the environments\ninspired by the aforementioned two games. I chose to disregard most of it, but it makes\nfor some neat themes to think about while playing. The presence of six-degrees-offreedom\ncontrols however make KROMAIA’s worlds essentially function like outer\nspace, just digitized. It’s an interesting mix and a fitting cover that eventually reveals a\nblend between western space simulator and Japanese rail shooter gameplay, balanced a\nbit more towards the latter.\n\nWhat some people may find odd is, despite KROMAIA’s flight being fully 3D, most of\nthe enemies act like they’re in a rail shooter. They usually automatically fly in front of\nyou and sit there for you to dodge and target. Navigating the world may require 6DOF\nskills, but dealing with enemies typically means dodging projectiles headed towards the\nscreen and properly tracking enemy movements with rapid-fire weapons, eventually\nreaching bullet-hell territory. The way enemies track you makes it basically impossible\nto dodge around them. KROMAIA even has structures that look like you should fly\nthrough them like in a rail shooter, but the 6DOF controls just let you bypass them\ncompletely. Players expecting a funky-looking DESCENT or TERMINAL VELOCITY\nmight be disappointed. Players looking for a STAR FOX type of thing will probably be\nmore satisfied.\n\nA really interesting thing KROMAIA does is give you a completely new ship and set of\nweapons upon first entering each level, and the adjustment period feels fresh each time.\nThe fourth weapon set in particular threw me for a loop. I won’t spoil it, but it’s\nsomething I never expected to see in a 3D space shooter, and using it is a huge\nadjustment. After unlocking all four you have to beat each level with each. This restarts\nthe learning process because of the enemies distinct to each world. I’m not sure whether\nit was a good idea for the game to force you to play each level four times. It would have\nmade for a nice extra feature if you didn’t have to.\n\nOne thing I really like KROMAIA’s handling of is item placement and secrets. It’s part of\nwhat makes it feel like older, simpler space shooters (both western and Japaense). Each\nlevel contains secret items that are pretty cleverly hidden, some of them behind doors\nrequiring hidden keys. Each level also contains “dungeons” where you fight enemies\nwho drop almost the only health items you’ll find. It all adds a nice classic action\nadventure feel to KROMAIA. Oh, and this game’s tutorials are just optional nodes to hit\n-- something far too few games to these days. Finishing the game unlocks a score attack\nmode with its own completely unique area.\n\nThere are parts to KROMAIA that make you question whether the game knows what it\nwants to be, but it’s still a really unique mix of genres and influences that I’m really glad\nsomeone decided to make.","December 11, 2014","true","12.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

She has a vendetta against four gods who have somehow wronged her. She gives you a task. Kill them. To fulfill her wish, you must journey through neon-drenched dreamscapes that are strewn with strange ruins and populated by abstract machine-creatures intent upon destroying you.\n\nLuckily, mother doesn’t send you on your quest for revenge without the proper attire needed for committing godocide. Your first “armor," as the ships are called, can obliterate swarms of enemies and weave deftly past obstacles.  And for every "divine" corpse you produce, you are rewarded with a new armor. Each comes equipped with a unique weapon of mass destruction--ranging from a shotgun-like scatter shot to an energy disc that can slice through multiple foes. These tools are distinct enough to require modifying one's playstyle. Put these features together with the game's adaptive enemey AI, and the result is exciting (and challenging!) shmup gameplay.\n\nGood gameplay is essential for any successful shmup, but Kromaia offers more than fast ships, cool enemies, and big explosions. Kromaia is an aesthetic marvel: it creates an atmosphere of wonder that few games manage to capture. Mother’s ominous commands are cryptic alien echoes. Armors are an anatomy of moving, detailed parts. Gods are mechanical behemoths slumbering among the pillars of temples that float on a sea of stars. All these elements add up to a unique game that should be experienced not only by shmup fans but also by anyone who enjoys gaming.\n\nKromaia is one of the best releases of 2014.

Yep. That's this game.\n\nGoing in, this game will make no sense. It's only later that you actually figure out what the heck is going on.\nAccompanying this feeling initial feeling of "What is happening" are the slippery controls that don't know the word "stop". Eventually, you'll figure out how to overcome them but they're still there and won't go away.\nMost of the levels have great music, that is except for the boss theme which feels less intense than most of the level music.\nThe only other aspect of this game that was disappointing was [spoilers] the same four levels get used over and over. As I had gotten this game as a part of an indie bundle I didn't really feel the need to 100% or even beat the game to get my money's worth so I just called it good after I beat the standard 4 levels. I felt like it was the idea of encountering new levels to explore and fly around in vs replaying the same level multiple times with different playstyle wasn't quite as satisfying. After all, it's that initial conquest on the unknown, understanding what the heck this game even is, learning how the controls/levels work. That’s what made me love this game, playing all the levels again so I knew them down to a "T" wasn't an idea way for me to play the game.\n\nFor $20, give a look. For a steam sale, definitely give it a buy! Had an actual blast during the time I spent with this game! An incredibly unique, visually stimulating, and high-octane space shooter.

The keybinding is complete, with support for various mouse axis, both scrolling directions, mouse 4/5, etc. Visual options are very minimal, missing AA and V-sync toggles (both off by default, available in config files). No real graphical settings other than post processing, including Bloom, DOF, and optional scanline/pixel filters. On insanely unique thing, is that all 3 of those options can be tabbed through using F5-F7 at any time. That's the kind of thing you go out of your way to mod into a game, binding console commands to hotkeys, so it's amazing and crazy to see that kind of feature right out of the box. The game seems to accept forced Adaptive V-sync and runs well at 120FPS with minimal horsepower. It seems to support any res your display is capable of, though I can't confirm multi-display or scaling for 21:9 or wider. FOV is unchangeable and I do wish that was an option. I didn't feel nauseous or anything, but I did feel the perception of depth at times was lacking. Mouse control in the menus functions like a joystick which is really odd and pretty unusable, but it's perfectly fine and responsive with the keyboard.\n\nGameplay\nI jumped into the main game right away, and ended up skipping the tutorial because of the non-standard implementation of it. It pops up and tells you how to turn the camera in front of a little animation of the ship turning, though you have no control of the ship or the transitions of the tutorial pages, and if you click or hit enter, it goes to the control mapping menu, where you hit save and continue and it takes you into the game. It's a really odd way to do things, and I feel it could be vastly improved by simply using arrow keys to switch between each of the tutorial screens, with "Press Enter to Continue" at the bottom. It does this each time you enter any gameplay mode so it's not gone, but it resulted in me going in the first time having no idea what anything did.\n\nLuckily, most of the general controls were intuitive right out of the gate. It's essentially first person shooter controls, with Q and E to roll, and Space to boost. Z/X/C operate a grappling hook you get in the first level, and scrolling up and down controls vertical strafing. Boosting is directional based on your strafing direction which is really nice. So instead of turning the camera up and to the right, and then boosting to go that way, you can strafe right and up, boost to fly in that direction, while still aiming your ship forward. That said, I felt the arrangement could be improved, and the mapping options make that very possible. I used Shift and Space for vertical strafing, the further mouse thumb button for secondary attack, the closer for the grappling hook (click to fire, click to detatch, and hold to reel in), with the right mouse button for boost. It makes it feel a even more like a 3D first person shooter, and grapple on the mouse is much easier to use than having it it below WASD limiting your movement while using it.\n\nAcross the two modes, story and score attack, there are 4 different colored ships that seem to fly the same, while having different primary and secondary weapons. Rapidfire+Shotgun, HomingShots+HomingShotgun, SlowLazer+SustainedBeam, etc. The score mode is seemingly endless, with orbs to pick up while being chased by enemies, and it let's you have your choice of any of the 4 ships. The story mode consists of a hub world with 4 gates, and it seems you enter each once to fly around collecting orbs while being attacked in the order it says until a boss appears, and once defeated, back in the hub you get a colored armour (ship type) to then take back into each of the other gates, for essentially 4 runs of each stage.\n\nIn the main HUB area, there are clear orbs with a DNA-like spiral in them that pop up some tutorial text when you pass through them. Right after being plopped in that hub it was really difficult to understand what was happening, and those tutorial bubbles were so spread out and in no particular order that they weren't of much use. The average player hopping in like I did, will likely pickup on the controls right away, but the goal or what anything is takes a bit of digging. On one hand it could be tackled in a better way, but on the other side, if the point was to make the player feel like they're in an alien world where they have to learn the rules themselves, it achieved that. I had a level of intrigue specifically because it told me very little. On a similar note though, I do feel the game needs better communication of things to the player. There's a beeping that occurs, and it's hard to tell if it's because your being hit or because you just picked something up. Hit confirmation is along the same lines, and I feel adding a noise or confirmation upon successful hit can be satisfying. I wasn't clear on whether or not I was really even doing damage to the boss in the 3rd gate until I explicitly saw a part break off.\n\nFinally, the controls certainly feel nice, though I feel it could use one thing. A faster response time for turning the ship/aiming. I get it, it's a ship rotating in a 3D environment with momentum and such, but I feel the mechanical satisfaction would improve dramatically with that change. I'd like it for all 4 ships, but at the very least I feel it's needed on the Red colored ship, which really screams for fast precision aiming because of it's slow rate of fire and pinpoint accuracy. You can't really snap-aim to targets very well because of the momentum, and I think it would feel amazing if you could.\n\nPresentation\nVisually I think it looks fine, though not by default. The post processing effects I mentioned above, and as seen in the official screenshots/footage of the game, make it extremely blurry. You could squint and it wouldn't change what you're able to see. After you disable those effects via the menu or F5-F7, the game is far clearer and has a better sense of space, though it's still ever so slightly blurred. The game mid firefight is really quite cluttered so it's hard to tell what's really happening, but it's much more manageable with all the bloom and blurring off. In the very beginning of the story mode you fly through some rectangular tunnels and it uses TV white noise/static effect every few seconds that I found annoying, but it didn't really crop up again after that.\n\nThe music and sound effects I felt were suitable, but nothing in particular stood out to me.\n\nTLDR - Summary\n~IN PROGRESS~ The quality of the port is surprisingly high, and the game is much more engaging than I initially suspected from the screenshots/trailer. I'd equate it to some weird little Japanese gem you stumble upon on the PS1, but from an alternate universe where they were making great PC titles instead. I've not finished the game so I can't really speak on the full amount and variety of it's content, but what I have seen will definitely have me back to see, and I'll update this once I know more.","September 8, 2015","true","5.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","5"

Not perfect, but extremely entertaining in short bursts.\n\nI picked this up from the Humble Store after seeing that it was a 6-degrees of freedom shooter with a tron-like aesthetic.   So far, pretty satisifed.   It has a very minimal interface, and a graphical and art style that reminds me a bit of Rez, Geometry Wars, and (oddly) Strike Suit Zero, along with an eletronic/ambient soundtrack.    There is a sparsely told story about a son getting revenge against 4 Gods who are responsible for some sort of catastrophe, the narrator is the father, reaching out to the son via his thoughts.\n\nThe control method is similar to Descent, although unlike that game series this game takes place almost entirely in open environments, rather than in cramped tunnels.   It feels a little bit looser than descent, as the ship has mass and momentum, and moves more like something bound by Newtonian physics, rather than moving in the sudden, violent manner than the Descent ship did.\n\nThere are some problems and bugs.   Occasionally the sound would dissolve into bizarre static, or a single note in the soundtrack would drag, as if my sound card were recieving improper commands from the game.    There are some issues with collision detection and spawning.    Several times, Orion (the God/Boss composed of concentric rotating rings) would spawn on top of a tower in the level, and then get "stuck" on the geometry of the structure and jitter around.  This happened several times in a row before it spawned properly again.   however as the game is currently only in the 1.0 release version, I expect these will be resolved with patches fairly soon.\n\nStylistic notes:   The HUD is extremely minimal.   All it tells you is how many shields you have left, where the next objective is, and where some of the nearby enemies are.    The game in general is fairly difficult, as it is a "bullet hell" shooter.   Anyone playing this should expect it to be fairly challenging.   Each level gets progressively more difficult , until eventually the screen is full of enemies and bullets almost all the time.   Sometimes this can get tiring or exhausting, so I recommend just playing the game in short bursts.\n\nIf you are a fan of tron-style games, space shooters, or any combination thereof, I think you should pick it up.","December 21, 2014","true","2.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tycho_Brahe/recommended/285980/","Tycho_Brahe","Punished Blart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tycho_Brahe/","156 products in account","Forward\nOKAY, first of all I'm going to inform you that this game only made a measly 2,000 dollars for it's flex-fund kickstarter on IndieGoGo, so, it's current condition is far beyond probable and in the realm of absolutely expected. However, that doesn't really excuse the little bit of false advertising in the game's description. The game itself, I still recommend.\n\nI've waited so long for a breakneck 6DOF shooter, you don't even know. Freespace Open has a couple of mods that smack of this kind of gameplay, but nobody has really taken up the mantle with serious 6DOF gameplay, as FS is mostly a spaceflight sim. The BSG TC Diaspora does have some serious sliding controls, but I'd have to look more into it.\n\nReview\nThe movement was difficult to master but really rewarding once you got the hang of it. The graphics had some serious eyestrain, but you can turn all that down. The use of minimalistic graphics allows the game to reside in a 400MB package, which is really impressive for most modern games. And the optimization is god-tier, where my old HD5670 can run it at 1080HD fullscreen.\n\nSome of the weapons have a lot to be wanted, but overall the design was stellar. A gunner, a seeker, a seer, and a knight. All of them having a base attack and a really powerful variation on that base attack. Each of the armors makes for a different experience, although it feels like there should be unit shifts for different armors, instead of the same for each venture. Some of the weapons specifically need a buff, like the seeker armor needs a primary fire with a smaller turning radius, as it has trouble hitting targets that you're strafing with, and the secondary fire needs more firepower and a larger lock-on cone.\n\nEDIT2: The HUD needs some work, especially the 1st person HUD. You can't see your weapon status of the light needle (red armor's secondary) nor can you see the fuel in the advanced boosters. Heck, it's hard enough trying to see it while moving around in 3rd person.\n\nThe collectible keys as of yet have no purpose besides one, which is a grapple. My only frustration with it, is that you will probably crash into an asteroid with it and you cannot draw in enemies whatsoever, which is stuff. However, it will come in REAL handy when facing off against Argos with the knight/Psi armor.\n\nThere are only four sectors, but they're all really good, having a complement of different sub-sections and often the need to go up, down, or alter your baseline orientation to make the most of it. All four are just the right length, too. Their designs and themes are also good. However, I get the feeling like some places don't have any real use, or maybe some of it was destroyed and what's left is still rustily churning away, because the modularity of their constructions allows for this.\n\nThe AI is pretty well done, but in some cases you can be completely still and not get hit. Only in the green sector tho; anywhere else you might get swamped. Movement is key when facing off, but some enemies will actually move with you and you can't shake them -  you'll need to take them out. Speed and reflexes are still a big deal. There's a huge variation on fighting styles from the enemies, which is excellent. However, the AI can be dumb as bricks at times, especially in closed-in spaces. The beam-mine things however are always dumb, and are explicitly built as speed traps and to throw you off balance while they zoom past you. This is a good design.\n\nWhile the game is quite incomplete, what it currently has under its belt is a great starting point, making the game enjoyable from start to finish. I actually binge-played this until about 5am in the morning just to finish it. The end boss wasn't hard enough, IMO, but it didn't feel any different from the rest of the game, which is good - keep moving keep shooting.\n\nHowever, the Omega armor has a profile a bit too big and the spiny things on the fins are a bit distracting. I don't terribly care for it, but it is faster and does more damage. The first time you complete the game it has the gun armor's weapons; I think you get the other weapon setups for each completion.\n\nIt also has triple-chording.\n\nEDIT: It appears from the trailers that there is a lot of cut content. Hopefully these will be published later after getting polished, or are still in the assets and can be brough out through modding. I think they're going to add Steam Workshop support later.\n\nSummary\nPros:\nGood AI variation\nWeapons and armor designs\nLevel design\nEmphasis on the 6DOF within level design\nGraphics\nNG+\nTriple-chording\nThe simple fact the team never gave up on the project despite only getting 2k for their kickstarter\nCons:\nAI needs more savagery\nDoesn't actually have a destructible environment\nCertain areas in levels don't appear to have any real use\nSome weapons need a buff of some kind\nBosses don't feel exactly difficult, not counting what armor you bring\nKeys don't do anything\nGrapple needs more utility\nOmega armor has too big of a profile and the spiny things on the fins are distracting\nUnused huge gate above the largest planet\n\n8/10 hope to see more stuff in the future, and hopefully some kind of sequel.","September 4, 2015","true","11.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game needs a dedicated group for those who treasure and love this game and the game seriously needs some DLC for more levels. I am not asking for a sequel as Kromaia is an amazing stand-alone title that has risen above all other 6DOF games to become a classic. I wish more people knew about Kromaia but sometimes word of mouth is the best marketing tool and as with all classic games which mature Kromaia will become legendary. Worth every penny.

Well, you would get Kromaia.\n\nActually, scratch that. Kromaia is its own thing. A its core, it's a full 360º degree STG with arcade space shooter elements in the controls. Thus, it has physics-based movement and enemies but shooting mechanics, scoring and overall presentation and style harkening to the shmup/STG genre, complete with bullet patterns, enemy formations ganging on your ship and gigantic bosses.\n\nThe presentation oozes mystery, with some cryptic voice in an alien language and all the menus displayed in a symbolic language before you pick each option. This alien feeling is prevalent throughout all the game and is part of what makes Kromaia so unique and intriguing, entrancing. The music only amplifies that feeling, with some pretty damn nice tunes and sound effects that are a bit on the muted side but also help to provide this sort of "calm" destruction feeling as you fly at full speed doing 360º spins and dodging heavy lead.\n\nAs you play you will unlock different armors that provide alternate firing modes, ranging from regular scatter fire, guided laser missiles, a melee sword reminiscent of Radiant Silvergun with a shuriken-like shield/strike and a laser cannon to pierce heavens.\n\nOn top of that there is an unlockable ship but you have to get all the treasure keys hidden in the 4 stages.\n\nThe dynamics of the stage is as follows: you pick up 20 jump gate components and fight a stage boss. Simple as that. Easier said than done.\n\nThere is also a true final boss that needs to be unlocked by clearing all 4 stages with all 4 default armors and this is where the game feels like they had to pad things out to squeeze some extra hours. I would've preferred hidden bosses in each stage if I have to re-tread them 4 times. At the very least, this will let you familiarize with the different armors to learn their strengths and weaknesses and then tackle score attack mode.\n\nSo, yes, when you think it's all over... Oh, wel, I won't spoil the suprise but, regardless of the repetition, reaching that true final boss (and, thus, completing the game for real) is quite something.\n\nAnother interesting thing is that the devs seem to keep working and updating the game now and then, which is always welcomed. In fact, not so long ago they offered a chance to tone done different settings, including one that allows to control the level of the blur in the game, something that for people with severe myopia like me helps a lot since blurry things strain my eyes enormously.\n\nAll in all, worth a shot but if you are not a fan of this kind of genre I will suggest to wait a bit for a sale and trying then.","July 12, 2015","true","11.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/devlkore/recommended/285980/","devlkore","devlkore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/devlkore/","433 products in account","This game is like a hybrid of Forsaken and Rez. If you like games with 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF) then it's definitely worth a look. The controls (I played with a controller) are mostly fine and feel very responsive, the graphics are very stylized and the music is nothing amazing, but very nice to listen to while playing.\n\nThe basic game play is each level has 20 jump gate pieces that must be collected and then when you do, you fight a boss. As you collect more and more jump gate pieces, the enemy count increases and they become more hostile and the enemy variety increases too.\n\nThe game seems fairly short: There are 4 main levels which you must beat with a specific "armor" (different handling and weapons). After beating a given level with it's default armor, you can then use any armor to beat it. This is actually a requirement; you must beat each of the 4 main levels with each of the 4 main armors. I haven't done that yet, but the game leads me to believe it will unlock a fifth level, boss and armor, though I cannot guarantee it.\n\nPersonally I don't mind the length of the game. The levels can get pretty tricky as you collect jump gate pieces (fortunately, the death penalty is minimal), the different armors are fun to pilot and I can see myself replaying the levels even after I beat it fully. There is also a score attack and leaderboards for both modes.\n\nObviously no game is right for every single person, but I would recommend this game if you like any of the following: Forsaken, Decent, Rez, Zone of the Enders, abstract Tron like graphics, general agile mech action, arcadey space combat games or if you ever wished Space Harrier had sucked you into the console as a kid.","September 1, 2015","true","5.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This chaos quickly translates into a frustrating game of junk-dodging and eventual disorentiation. If you manage to recover your bearings, you can quickly speed off into the next choatic encounter.\n\nGameplay:\nThe controls are clunky at first and there is a fairly unforgiving learning curve. I'm still not there yet, but I'm sure with time I'll eventually get the hang of it and expertly speed off to my death with ease.\n\nStory:\nThe game focuses more on gameplay than story. If there is a story, I have a feeling it won't be an incredibly deep or engaging.\n\nOverall:\nIf you're looking for a quick and easy space adventure, look elsewhere. This game's controls take some time to learn and you'll have to master them to move forward. The game quickly becomes chaotic and is a great challenge for someone looking to master flying and shooting your way to victory.","August 28, 2015","false","0.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

You use bad flying controls to fly around huge boring environments. Random guys and objects show up, but because everything is so unclear and just random blocks and shapes, you never know whos an enemy, or when something is being fired at you. You just go around collecting rings, and you have 20 collect 20. Apparently you have to replay every level 4 times, 1 with each ship, to get further, because they were too lazy to design many levels and just wanted annoying filler. Saving isn't explain, I leveled up but that wasn't explained. You have 2 firing types. Theres boost and rotation, and doesn't seem to be anything else. I died after 7 min on the level and had to restart because I'd collected 19/20 rings. You lose shields, but theres no shield meter, and restoring shield's isn't explained. This game is basically a game with bad controls, with unexplained mechanics, with ugly and cluttered screen none of which is clear what things are, with bad save system, and a bunch of filler added in.

If you are offended by criticism, non-worshipping approach to your favorite game, or opinions that do not match your own, do not read any further.\n\nI rarely write negative reviews but this is one of few games that none of my friends has ever played, so I feel obliged to let them know some of my impressions.\n\nIn my desperate search of a de(s)cent (!) 6-axis shooter, I gave Kromaia a shot. But except for cool and stylish menus, promising an intelligent design, this game doesn't work for me on many levels. The controls are unbalanced (e.g. rolls much faster than yaws and pitches), the geometry is clumsy (what's the fun with so much randomly floating debris?), the level design is virtually nonexistent - you can't tell the scale of anything; the in-game UI is particularly calling for vengeance. Last thing, the story is pure babble (but at least this shouldn't matter in a bullet hell game).\n\nI find particularly misleading that the artwork of this game shows some clear and crisp geometry with lots of style and sometimes an extra outline, while in-game everything is badly blurred.\n\nAs much as I wish the developers all the best, I suggest giving this game (even) more playtesting. I'm sorry for them not having won their kickstarter campaign, as I like very much the idea of this game.","December 15, 2014","false","1.7"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","16"

For starters the controls are ungodly stiff to the point that it is far too easy to end up smashing constantly into walls and running into obstacles, obstacles that DAMAGE you, simply because your ship decided to take a second to start accelerating.\n\nThe game is outright repetitive as you are forced to run through each of the four levels four times in order to progress, and aside from a pallet-swap, they're basically all the same. Follow the compass until you collect 20 orbs, kill the boss, rinse and repeat. You have to do this FOUR times.\n\nThis is made worse by the checkpoint system being very poorly implemented as well. If you play on anything other than easy you can be sent back drastically simply because your ship delayed on moving causing you to take too much damage to your shields  and basically forfeit that life as a result.\n\nThe bosses aren't that hard either other than just being tedious. They change strategies once, maybe twice, each battle making them little more than repetitive struggles against the controls.\n\nWhile not the worst game ever by a long-shot, it certainly isn't worth the time to beat.","November 2, 2014","false","3.9"," 12 of 34 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","12","34","0","10"

"I know, let's make our spaceship a swordfighting game all of a sudden," thought the devs. Each of the four sections changes your weapons to be worse than the previous section.\n\nSo it's a great game. Except fot the last level. And the crappy weapons. You literally have to dive into a gun barrel and slash your spaceship sword and hope that the timing of their bullets isn't going to kill you. All while dodging bullets from another gun that you can't kill for no reason. And then if you manage to get past that, you can attempt to kill the boss, but they're going to shoot bullets at you faster than you can dodge or swordfight. I don't play games that rely on luck and you shouldn't either. That being said, I think this dev can make a good spaceship game, just stop trying to impress us and make it fun with what you already have that is awesome.\n\n","September 19, 2015","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
