"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnivore/recommended/415670/","somnivore","Chewable C++","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnivore/","2644 products in account","This is a fantastic word game. One of the best I've ever encountered.\n\nWhat makes it great? The full package. It's a good boggle type game that also happens to have a very fun story (written by an actual young adult fiction writer) and a nice overall presentation.\n\nAnd, it's obvious that the developer set out to make a good game, not just another lame clone with minor variations. In all honesty, I was expecting the latter when I bought it (I'm a sucker for boggle clones), but I was really surprised!\n\nI won't spoil the story at all, but it's just a lot of fun. The gameplay is arranged into a (long) series of individual levels, with short (mostly dialogue) cutscenes in between. At first I assumed that the cutscenes were lazy fluff, but I found myself actually looking forward to each one! Especially on the later levels that proved quite challenging and make me work harder for the next scene.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't standard boggle, it's the Bookworm Deluxe type variant where tiles disappear and the grid falls downward when you make a word. Like Bookworm Deluxe, it also has some special tiles. But, it gets more complicated...\n\nInstead of just trying to form big words quickly (most levels are actually not timed), you typically need to "rescue" characters that appear as tiles in the grid, by getting them to the bottom. Each character, while still on the grid, also has special abilities that can be played at the cost of moves or time. Each level either gives you a set amount of moves or set amount of time to complete.\n\nThe characters (most of them, anyway), have an oxygen gauge. If you let their oxygen run low, you lose, so you have to either rescue them very quickly, or replenish their oxygen by connecting them as part of words to blue letter tiles.\n\nThere's a variety of special tiles like glass, fire, and debris, that require different strategies to deal with properly.\n\nSo, unlike most boggle clones that are about speed, this one tends to be much more about strategy - not just trying to find the longest word, but making the right word in the right place at the right time, and knowing when to use the special abilities.\n\nThere are also arithmetic levels with numeric tiles instead, where the goal is to form a specific sum (tiles include positive and negative numbers from -9 to 9 (but not 0).\n\nThere are a lot of levels with a slowly increasing difficulty curve. The later levels can present decent challenges even to seasoned word gamers. Besides the basic goal of the level (usually rescuing the characters), there are also stars awarded for performance (usually score, but not always), a leaderboard for every level (steam integrated), and special "banana" goals for most levels (these are for forming particular kinds of words, e.g. 7+ letters). So, plenty to do, plenty to shoot for.\n\nFor achievement hunters, if you're good at boggle games, this might take you 20-30 hours to 100% (as long as you're also not terrible at arithmetic).\n\nThe base price is quite fair, and the introductory sale price is quite generous. Definitely one of the better purchases I've made.","January 12","true","61.9"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","46","48","0","7"

The goal of this game is to bring the characters to the bottom of the screen by using the letters on the grid, many levels aren't timed but gives you a limit of words to use which allows you to take your time and find better words instead of rushing and just doing 3 letters words.\n\nSo if like me english isn't your first language and you are hesitating to rather buy the game or not, let me tell you that as long as you have an average vocabulary this game is fun and not too difficult nor too easy for people like us :)\n\nHave a great day.","January 9","true","5.2"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

It's a clever word play game which, although based on a conventional word-finding mechanic, provides a surprisingly wide variety of challenges.\n\nThe background music is nice without being obtrusive and sounds like it's probably been remastered / whatever for the Steam version; it really sounds nice on my computer. Unfortunately the options for music are just on/off and I really prefer a volume control but I guess that's what my mixer is for.\n\nAnd . . . the letters always seem to be arranged in a way that you find incredibly long words. This makes you feel either super bright or super lucky. Or maybe that's just me because I am the BOSS of HH.\n\nAlso great:\n\nthe dialogue is surprisingly witty\nbetter character development than most games\nit has a monkey!\nHaven't you always wanted a monkey?\n\nRating: 10 bananas (out of 1 pocket).\n\nI would totally rescue Sir Arthur from the rubble again.","January 8","true","59.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/athravan/recommended/415670/","athravan","Athravan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/athravan/","863 products in account","Highrise Heroes is a boggle-style word building game where you match adjacent tiles to make the best word possible, triggering various score bonuses and explosions based on the strategy you went for. Whilst a story may seem like an unlikely addition to this type of game, it does actually have an element of mystery and discovery as you try to figure out what exactly went down in this bizarre skyscraper. In between each of the levels there is dialogue, which is a little bit tongue in cheek bad. I thought it was actually well written, but with characters that are designed to be obvious tropes and the writer was clearly looking for groans and facepalms along the way. Nothing too serious and it did actually make me laugh a few times.\n\nAs the game unfolds you get more and more characters, each of which has a special ability. The characters you get on each level are story-based, so you don't get to choose. Some levels include things like saving a teddy bear, or mopping up some water along the way. There are also a lot of monkeys, collectible flag-based bananas and a character named Captain Amazeballs, because why not.\n\nIn addition to the regular word challenges, there are occasional number levels where you need to match combinations of numbers, both positive and negative which I found surprisingly fun. Not fun enough to want a whole game based around it, but enough to keep it fresh every now and again.\n\nSome of the levels are incredibly simple, but others, especially the timed challenges, are incredibly hard! There's a little bit of a disconnect in difficulties, but generally speaking as you progress to the end of the game, it gets harder, and harder and harder... I would say that this is probably one of the more challenging word-based games to complete that I've played and at times, a little frustrating, but I got there in the end.\n\nOverall the amount of strategy, different level types, different challenges and increasing difficulty makes this one of the most feature-complete word games I've played - with a lot of replayability in the star and score system, including global and friend based leaderboards. It's not just another clone, it does bring originality so it gets a thumbs up from me.","January 24","true","35.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

This simple premise alone wouldn't have sustained the player through 90 levels so thankfully we have lots of other minor mechanics and distractions to stir things up. There's admirable attention to detail everywhere, in the menus and storytelling as well as the game levels. The game even accepts US and UK spellings.\n\nAn update rolled out today (Feb 4 2016) is the option to turn off the timer without being penalised. This is most welcome as my only grumble prior to this update was the unnecessary (IMO) pressure of a time limit on some levels. Now you just uncheck the timer box on the level info screen and take your sweet time. It won't even affect your achievements.\n\nHighrise Heroes is 10/10 if you're a word game junkie.","January 24","true","49.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Ever wanted to see a word game and a survival game mashed up? Well, here you go. Highrise Heroes tasks you with spelling, keeping your folks oxygenated, maneuvering through rubble and impassable tiles, managing your turns (survivors have helpful powers but they cost turns to use). Sometimes you'll be racing the clock, sometimes you won't. There's plenty of variety that I've seen so far, so it's not repetitive. There are plenty of achievements and objectives to keep you addicted for hours at a time.","January 8","true","20.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

Steam is lacking great word games and this one fills the void quite nicely. It also had a few levels that were math levels too, which were a nice surprise and changed up the gameply in a nice way.\n\nAs you can see, you're just making words like in Boggle where you use connected letters. However, this game has obvious obstacles and other things to stop you the later you get in the game to make it a little more of a challenge. And as usual, the letters fall down when used, and if you make a 5 letter word or longer you get blocks that explode removing more blocks and getting more points. There's also character blocks that let you expand the words to use letters further away that you couldn't normally reach, the characters give you abilties you can use to help you beat levels and of course you have to save the charcters each level while making sure they they keep their oxygen levels high enough, which is just linking blocks of oxygen into them before finishing your word\n\nAll in all, I comepletely recommend this if you like word games. You will definitely, 100% not be disappointed. I can't believe how good this game is with it having such a low price. It seems to have a fairly large amount of content as well.","January 10","true","10.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
