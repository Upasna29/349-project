This is the game's standalone comeback in it's largest graphical update ever.\n\nWhat's changed?\n\nDead Island Definitive Edition is using a new graphical engine (Chrome 6) which means better textures, lighting, character models, and smoothness at 30fps+ unlocked fps. The port from the original has transitioned nicely, no major glitching happening in this ♥♥♥♥♥. I have had no issues with joining friends for co-op at all. The update is priced at around $3(USD) for the update if you own the original Dead Island on Steam.\n\nThis update is worth the price of $3 if you enjoyed the original game but felt it was a bit clunky or ugly. There are no changes to the storyline, leveling system, skill tree etc. Meaning if you didn't like the game before for any reason other than graphical engine, it's still probably a game you won't like.\n\nIf you haven't played this game before and want to buy it, I suggest a co-op experience for the best experience.

(Jump Energy really should re-consider their prices as $5 is more than I paid for this game)\n\nNot a fan of energy drinks? well too bad, energy drinks and alcohol seems to be the only beverages you can obtain. (And yet they wonder why people are dropping dead)\n\nYou can choose between 5 different playable characters, all with different skills. You're basically "Patient zero" as you've been bitten but have not turned, basically you're immune against the zombies or "walkers" bites.\n\nIf that doesn't make you feel special enough as it is I'm glad to inform you that you're also immune to type 2 diabetes and heart attacks considering there's atleast one energy drink every 10 meters, and your player can jugg down a can in 3 seconds. But wait, there's more. The players can also drink an unlimited amount of energy drinks aswell, making you a role model for all no-lifers like me out there.\n\nAll that and yet your character never appears to be in need of a bathroom.\n\nOverall great game, but I would like to see more variety of energy drinks in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n","May 31","true","7.8"," 53 of 74 people (72%) found this review helpful 74 people found this review funny","72","53","74","74","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jabsownurl/recommended/383150/","jabsownurl","A Person","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jabsownurl/","264 products in account","I loved dead island, but I am disappointed thus far with this definitive edition, and as such, I feel compelled to give my first ever review.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the only improvements about this "definitive edition" is the textures, lighting, and loading times -- it seems to run a bit smoother, and look a bit better. As for what I feel has been worsened/ruined:\n\nNegatives:\n\n- GORE: The gore has been absolutely butchered. Not only does the blood look incredibly discoloured, and pool terribly (small puddles, sometimes not even near the body), but the bodie's don't gloriously squirt blood anymore, and the corpses more or less look worse than the original.\n\n- Corpses: I can't say whether or not this happens 100% of the time, but when you behead them, they go bald, the heads/limbs sometimes disappear, and the textures on the corpses overall seem a bit glitchy. This, along with super fast despawning of decals and corpses, and the fact that they don't exactly bleed anymore, just makes for pitiful piles of carnage.\n\n- Aim/Throwing: This is hideous. It seems like 70% of the time my throws will just completely miss the target, no matter how close or far they are from me, or how long I line the throw up; It just seems completely random, and only serves to make me think it's not even worth throwing my weapons anymore (I loved throwing my weapons in the original).\n\n- Zombie difficulty: Granted I'm not far through the game, so I can't really comment on balancing later on, but my initial impression is that zombies are much weaker, damage wise, than they were in the original, and that they get knocked around so easily, whilst taking ages to stand back up -- They're just not scary at all.\n\n- Physics: Overall, the physics-based movements of some objects have been taken out or reduced, e.g., the crowd favourite: being able to move the beach ball.\n\n- Blur: There is so much graphical blur. Far too much. Your peripheral vision essentially becomes a horrible looking blurry mess when running, and basically your whole screen becomes blurred when low on stamina. This, on top of the usual suspects, e.g., motion blur, DoF, etc. makes for an annoyingly blurred experience most of the time.\n\n- Hopes of Future Fixes: As it stands, I have almost no hope that any of these issues will be fixed/changed, as I have not seen/heard anything from the developers to suggest that this is anything more than a rushed port of features/assets from dying light, which has only been done to make a little extra money, for as little effort as possible, and then abandoned.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOverall, the difficulty feels too easy, and, in my opinion, it has worse gameplay than the original. If you liked the carnage and gory fun from the first game, you'll be disappointed with this, and should just play the original. But, alternatively, if all you care about is looking at arguable gorgeous scenery, then you might be okay with supporting the devs on this.\n\nFinal Note: There are no doubt other things that I am forgetting to mention, but these are the main things that annoyed me. And I sincerely hope that people can explain to me that/why I am wrong about some of my mentioned negatives, in particular, the hope for fixes. Please, give me hope.","June 4","false","19.0"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","33","41","2","0"

When I heard they were coming out with a "defintive" edition, I was stoked. I hoped that they would be able to fix some of the glitches and make it look better.\n\nWhile they did manage to make it look better, I still have some complaints that are a MAJOR turn off for me.\n\nFirst off, you can no longer compare weapon stats nearly as easily. If I get a better weapon and fully ugprade it in the original version, it would say "100+25" in damage for example. That way you could easily see the base stats of the weapon (in case you see a weapon with better base stats) and can see the total stats. In this, however, they made it so it now just shows 125. If I see a new weapon in the shops, how am I supposed to know if its any better?\n\nSecond, is the motion of the game. They did (seemingly) decrease the amount of stamina it takes to sprint, which is nice, but it seems kind of weird being able to sprint that long. However, they increased the weapons motion. So now if you only use your fists, they are moving like you're a boxer and the zombies can't do anything. Same with weapons. They also just fall pretty much instantly to the ground. It doesn't look natural at all, and it takes away from the immersiveness of the graphics.\n\nAlso, my last complaint is the view distance. I was playing the game with everything maxed, including view distance. While the graphics do look nice and you can see that pretty far, this isn't the case with objects. I was going down a fairly long set of stairs, but I can easily see to the bottom of them. Theres a mid point where the stairs break off into another path and a dead body with a broomstick in it. I have 2 screenshots where I at first stand just far away enough to see it, then move a couple steps and... poof. Its just gone. They really killed the immersiveness with those.\n\nIts still a fun game and the graphics do look nice, but my complaints I feel don't make it worth an upgrade. If you want to buy this game outright, be wary. I don't have much playtime with this one but the upgrades to weapons feel MUCH cheaper and therefore make the game a hell of a lot easier, when the non definitve edition wasn't that hard in the first place.\n\nIf you can take those minor nitpicks (they however are a major turn-off for me), the game runs beatifully. The loading times are incredible.","June 1","false","1.0"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","27","44","0","4"

It has weid strong acceleration/inertia to it, stripping any fun from driving cars. (EDIT) Gun controls are horrendous. Guns have huge amount of unremovable auto aim. Dont try to use guns in this game, especially if you play mouse&keyboard.The only positive thing i can say about it is that its -85% off if you own the original. Definetly shouldnt buy this version, especially if you dont own the original.","May 31","false","7.5"," 28 of 49 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","28","49","4","0"

These days games are becoming sheer marketing, and it's nice to see a developer team not going down that road for once.)\n\nRight to the point............. this remaster is beautiful. I mean it! The graphics are stunning. The sunlight breaking through the palm trees. The depth and texture in even the most misc of objects. The perfect blue water you wish was real, so you could just dive right into it. If this island wasn't riddled with zombies, and if I had money to throw about, I'd be packing my bags, and getting the first flight to this gorgeous place! I honestly am so impressed with the graphics compared to what the original looked like.\n\nBesides the graphics, everything else is pretty much the same. The skill tree, the characters, the main quests + side quests, the weapons, etc....... all the same. So if you didn't like it because of that in the first place, you're logically not going to like it even now.\n\nA strange thing I've come across are the beach balls. On the original Dead Island, you could kick them about if you walked into them - even if they were inside pools next to the bungalows - they would move. Now they just stay still and you actually walk over them like they're rocks or something - pretty weird!\n\nANYWAY..... for the price it's at right now, you'd be mad not to get it.\n\n(THANKS TECHLAND FOR SUPPORTING FANBASE, INSTEAD OF THEIR WALLETS!)","June 4","true","1.7"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","6"

It is still the same game so if you did not like the originals you are not going to like them with a bit of icing on the top.\n\nI bought the originals when they were on sale and because of that was able to purchase both remastered games and the retro style game in the bundle for under £7 because lowering the price for owners of the previous titles a 85% is admirable and i will happily support developers who will do that. Some seem to be complaining about having to pay less than £2 for a game that surprisingly enough had to have people work on it to make this but they are filthy commies who want ♥♥♥♥ for free and we dont listen to them.\n\nMain complaint currently is the lack of an FOV slider, I currently found a fix for this and have it at 90 and there is some clipping and an issue with recoil on the pistol so hopefully that can be patched and fixed later.","June 1","true","3.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","7","10","3","5"

I am focusing on the fact that this is a Definitive Edition. Personally I love the Dead Island Franchise (what Techland worked on at least), however that is beside the point. This is reviewing the \"Definitive\" aspect of this game. With that being said...\n\nIf you enjoyed Dead Island, definitely get the Definitive Edition. If you\'ve thought about getting Dead Island and haven\'t gotten around to it, the Definitive Edition is worth picking up. If you like Zombie games, well, I think you know what comes next.\n\nDead Island Definitive Edition runs smooth as hell, and looks just as good (compared to the original that is). The enviornment is a lot prettier, the combat is more fluid, the game itself is deeply immersive. It feels like I\'m playing Dead Island for the first time again. I haven\'t run into any problems so far. It\'s everything Dead Island is, but better, as should a Definitive Edition be.\n\nI have played roughly 2 hours of the game as of writing this review, and I feel like I have played enough to get a feel so far, and truly say this game is worth getting.\n\nIN COMPARISON TO THE ORIGINAL:\n\nGraphics - Amazing, definitely improved.\nGameplay - Smoother and more immersive\nLoadtimes - For me, almost non-existant. I have seen a loading screen for a total of 1 second during my 2 hours of gameplay (I am NOT exaggerating)\nAudio - As of right now, the audio range seems to be a little off. It\'s hardly noticable, but I hear zombies that are pretty far away very clearly, and it keeps me on edge.\nNavigation - I haven\'t tried mouse and keyboard with Definitive Edition yet, but it works extremely well with a controller.\nOnline - Have not tried yet, will try to edit when I do\n\nOverall Dead Island Definitive Edition is a fantastic improvement from the original. If you were on the fence about getting this, I\'d say go ahead and get it, especially if you have the loyalty discount (85% off both Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide, making both $3.00 each).\n","May 31","true","26.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I don't know how Techland are getting away with it. They've rehashed the same game 3 or 4 times now. If it was a big company like EA or Activision people would be up in arms about it. Techland apparently gets a free pass.\n\nThey still haven't learned from their mistakes. The game is still god awful. Animations, combat, skills, weapon system, UI and now driving.\n\nI don't understand what it is with devs and messing with the driving mechanics when they work perfectly fine in previous versions. Rockstar did it with GTA5 and Techland have done it with this.\n\nThey say the game has been improved graphically and that is true to an extent. They've added Chromatic Abboration and  a 'new' lighting system but they've decided to use cheap water.\nFor those of you that don't know the difference. Cheap water is used to save on system resources, so that the game runs better. But usually if you're a good developer you have expensive water when you are up close and then when the water is almost out of sight then you use cheap water. Techland didn't do that and have decided to use cheap water so everything looks god awful.\n\nThey've changed the quest accept screen and the challenge screen and that's about it. Don't buy it, it's just awful.","May 31","false","41.6"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","14","26","2","0"

For all who may have played a little or on console but enjoys zombie games that are rpg's and include things like upgrading weapons and creating them for more damage... and more. Then you should give this game a try. They will obviously be updating this new release to take care of any bugs but as of rn i have only come to one thing that seems to be an ongoing accurance, this is that I seem to keep having problems going between areas where a normal human would easly be able to go through but it seems to catch on something.

Whether or not it's worth picking this up will entirely hinge on how important that is to you.\n\nNow for everyone else, Dead Island is a somewhat underrated little co-op, FPS/ARPG hybrid. Think melee-centric Borderlands with zombies and you get the idea. You'll be questing, looting and levelling one of four characters across three sprawling areas of tropical Banoi. Dead Island is a solid example of first person melee combat, it still holds up despite being superseded by Dying Light.\n\nWhilst the focus of the game is on four player co-op, solo play is viable and equally enjoyable. The sun soaked beach resort and city streets become a lot more sinister on your own and the games atmosphere really shines.\n\nYou've probably heard some terrible things about it, but Dead Island is often criticised for what it isn't, rather than praised for what it is. If the Borderlands style of looting and questing appeals to you, you could do a lot worse for a lot more money.\n\n","May 31","true","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is bright, the sunshine effects are beautiful and shadows look glorious.\n\nThe key mechanics of the game have not changed. It is still a buggy mess and this I enjoy it for. It gives it heart. Seeing a zombie flailing about half in and half out of a building - lovely. Honest.\n\nThere are other subtle differences - which I have no idea why changes have been made - for example in the original Dead Island, outside the life guard tower there is a huge poster of a female underwear model. In Definitive, this poster has been changed for something... err.. slightly less sexy.\n\nThere is less clutter like leaf litter etc, but there is more dust particles - although it looks more like snow.. or volvano fallout.\n\nIf you enjoy Dead Island (as I do), then grab this - especially if you can get it for the mad price of £1.80 (as I did). This is now my 4th playthrough of this wonderful game.\n\nCheap, beautiful, a bit messy at times, but fun as hell.","June 2","true","5.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","2"

The introduction of the all new physically-based shaders and photorealistic lighting system make it look more beatutiful than ever.

Whilst the graphics do look good, there wasn't much to improve on in terms of appearance. The real benefit here seems to be in terms of smoother gameplay, the premise hasn't changed but the combat you didn't realise was clunky is now really smooth. Yes there are a couple of options you may need to turn off depending on your system but unless you count frame rates (I don't as long as what I'm playing is fast and smooth) it plays really well. Don't let the gripes on the forums deter you, clearly there are people who've had issues (show me a game that runs well on all pc's) If you need recommendations look at the numerous positive reviews compared to the few bad. The only thing I'm not keen on is the 'dying light' mechanic on the vision burring when your character is low on stamina, is soon returns to crystal clarity but I've been for runs til I have to stop and take a breath and I don't recall my vision being impared. All in all though I'm quite happy with this updated version. I wonder if the riptide definitive edition sorts out the awful squad AI, I somehow doubt it though.","May 31","true","13.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Thankfully, five years on, we can appreciate the game as it was intended, in a remastered edition at a bargain price. Even at full retail $19.99 USD, I can strongly recommend this.\n\n$3 USD for the remaster if you already own the original Dead Island titles for PC. Hard to beat it at this price.\n\nPretty much removed all the bugs that plagued the original and tarnished an otherwise phenomenal game. Exceptional graphics that run so much better on modern systems at a stable unlocked framerate. I have a modest rig I built and it handles this game maxed out at 60fps solid with a 960 FTW and an AMD 8370 8 core. It has been ported to the Dying Light engine and runs as well as that does.\n\nThis does not alter the story of the original in any way, just refreshes it. Excited to see some new faces online! Co-op is always a blast and connecting with somebody is easy. Matchmaking is very well constructed for this game.\n\nI would really recommend this if you're looking to play the game again online with friends/new people/etc., but for only $3 per game, why not?\n\n","May 31","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(So far about 1 and a half hours played)\n\nI have no idea why this was made, no one was asking for it. In my opinion it was pointless.\nPros:\n-Graphics are beautiful!\n-If you have the original you get it 85% off.\n-Includes all the DLC even if you didn't have it (I think).\n\nCons:\n-The same game just better graphics.\n-No improved combat like in Dying Light.\n-If you've played the original this will be boring (it was for me).\n-The story is not the best.\n-The special/human NPC's are not fun to fight and are bullet sponges.\n-No improvement in the gore (wish they made it more like dying light's).\n-Boring missions.\n\nOver all I have very mixed opinions on this game. Is it worth $3? YES! Is it worth $20? NO! Unless you have never played a dead island game than this is not worth $20.\n\nIf you already played dead island and liked it then get this game. If you like zombie games get this game. I thought that the original dead island was ok. For me it wasn't bad but it wasn't good. In the end it just comes to prefference and I did not really enjoy the new definitve edition but it might change.\n","June 2","false","1.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Some people might like it, others won't. I hope it does get some future updates with fixes for various stuff and complaints from the negative reviews. I'm keeping it positive.\n\nSo far im into Act1 right after we get everybody to the lifeguard station. It definitely looks much better(graphics and lighting wise) and more detailed, but it needs more work.\n\nFirst my setup:\n* FX-6100\n* 2x4GB 1600MHz DDR3\n* 2GB Radeon HD7850\n* ProView with max res 1680x1050@60Hz\n\nI did quite some testing around first 2-3 missions. Most of the time i was at "balance" preset in video seetings, vsync on. I had random fps drops also dropping to 30fps close and inside buildings and it was noticeable. Tinkering settings was not a fix for this. Instead i finally lowered res to 1440x900 and i started playing with 60fps on those same places it had drops to around 30. Not only that, but since its different resolution it has higher refresh rate and my fps went up to 75 on some places. I stayed at balanced and MSI Afterburner showed the card to be at 99% on the gpu and temps going toward 65 degrees C, around 1200MB video memory taken. CPU went up to 70% load. RAM - around 5000MB.\n\nSome things i noticed:\n* They changed the standart(good old) number plates on cars.\n* Beach ball physics. Balls only roll for awhile when you walk into them.\n* Weapon trunks don't spawn stuff right away when you exit and enter game again(no more exploits i guess?).\n* Characters look better and more detailed.\n* Characters move their face(lips) more when they are talking(or is it my imagination?).\n* Game loading is shorter?\n* Different music during loading for Act1(if i'm not mistaken it's from the jungle act).\n* Ryder White is included, other dlcs should be.\n* More stuff i or someone else is yet to discover(or already has :> ).\n\nOk, i admit i read about the first two and had to see for myself. Im not completely sure about the lips/audio sync yet. They might have changed other item physics as well. However I am sure it still needs some bug fixes. For now my biggest complaint is probably the blood fx on ground- textures are glitchy and look ugly like low res. Also the blood puddle when you kill a zombie has some strange mirror effect on the surface and looks horrible.\n\nUsing this new engine, DI is demanding. So what i would recommend if you have fps drops - find the right settings combo and most imortantly the right resolution to get higher and stable frame rates on your hardware.\n\n\nUpdate 1: Only a few mission later...\n\n* So far doesn't seem to be any desync between lips and audio.\n* Objects/items placement is a bit off. Im talking about game objects, pickup items etc. For example on the way to the light house there is a crashed bus with luggage outside. The bags are slightly glitched(placed) in the bus. This is also noticed with some chocolate bars and wallets for example. Sometimes you have to change the angle and try again in order to pick them up. This release needed more testing. Nothing game breaking, but still worth to mention imo.\n* Characters say additional lines, like when you drive through and successfuly kill a zombie.\n* You can't enter the car from left side. In original DI there was a trick when you aim for the driver seat and when button prompt appears and you press it you immediately get in that seat. Just wanted to share this one :).\n* Remember the mission where you have to put boxes and finish SOS sign otside the lighthouse. The places of the boxes are not white/transparent but rather blue-ish transparent. Ugh kind of hard to explain, but i think you get the picture. This is the same for all mission where you have to deliver something to e certain spot.\n* I noticed new names of weapons: Awe inspiring home made machete. Never seen this kind of naming in the original DI, it must be new.\n* Ragdoll physics is kind of strange. When you kick dead bodies, you move them farther. While we are on topic about kicking, you know there are zombies which are dead by default, right? Sometimes when you kick them you get a "critical" hit sign. Weird.\n\n\nUpdate 2:\n\n*Jin looks kind of scary. There was some kind of noise coming from the truck, yet neither she nor her father were working on it. I'm talking about the time when you enter the workshop and before you start mission to upgrade the truck.\n*I was wrong about the weapon trunks/chests. But on some random occasions(i guess) there was no icon to open one or two just after i reloaded a game.\n*Your character doesn't have a shadow. I am sure there was one in the original DI. You could see some weird 3rd person animations thanks to that :) .\n*Some issues were fixed. Like the bunker where you take that russian guy from the helicopter crash. In DI there were shadows from the palm trees inside and the lighting was bad, like there was no ceiling. Nothing like that is presen in DI: DE.\n*More new names i dont remember from DI - debilitating baseball bat, mediocre stick, worn heavy wrench, used military machete. You can correct me if im wrong about this, or anything at all.\n*Ok, so the game switches back to windowed mode whenever it wants. I decided to try windowed with vsync off and at my max res 1680x1050. No framerate drops to 30. It runs better in windowed mode? Still takes a lot of juice from the card judging by the noise of the fans. Plays above 50-55 frames on balanced, in some areas well above 60.","May 31","true","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics were amazing, smooth gameplay, gore balanced just right. But the gameplay was slightly more buggier than the original Dead Island.\n\nExample 1, the 'lurking' zombies usually turn in your direction and lunge at you when you get close to them in the original Dead Island, but if you approach them while they're facing away from you in this game, they lunge in the direction they're facing at (not towards you).\n\nAnd also, during the mission where we have to drive the Armored Truck with Jin to the bunkers, there was an invisible object blocking the road somewhere near the ambulance where you find the paramedic bag for Jack in one of the early sidequests. I managed to drive to the side of the road to get past it.\n\nThe gate near the Laboratory (the one next to Sebastian's house where he asks you to send a short message to his parents on his computer) does not open wide enough for a car to go through. Is it supposed to be like that? If it is, then it really sucks because driving to Ope's Cave is much better than walking there.\n\nAnd my final example, at the Jungle, every lootable objects in the Laboratory area does NOT contain anything at all. Even the safes do not contain over a thousand dollars, they only contain about 60$ to 100$, sometimes containing shotgun ammo (who keeps shotgun ammo in safes?), and sometimes nothing at all. Besides the Laboratory, the zombies you kill drops ammo 90% of the time, which is irritating because I barely need any ammo.\n\nEDIT: Just encountered another bug while playing co-op. Once we recovered the Armored Truck from the Hotel, everytime we get into the truck, it goes haywire and it flings itself across the map, landing in a non-playable area. I got screenshots of this in my profile, you can check it out for yourself. It was hilarious at first but then it got pretty annoying after happening multiple times.\n\nPlease do fix these bugs, I'd gladly appreciate it and enjoy the game even more!","June 1","true","30.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

The game runs better and feels less wonky, but otherwise it's 100% the same. A lot of old bugs or weird engine quirks still exist, like certain surfaces you weren't meant to stand on which will bounce you off.\n\nIf you don't already own this game, I wouldn't buy it unless it's like $10. It includes all the DLC - all 3 of them - but is basically a replacement for Dead Island GOTY edition. It's $3 dollars if you already own it, so it's worth $3 just to check out the enhanced graphics.\n\nOn a sidenote, here's something funny. Techland at one point had patched Logan's kick because it was insanely overpowered, and basically their fix was to make it take more stamina. That fix is still in the game, but kick is still a more reliable attack than using any weapon at early game.\n\nI've seen people claim a lot of issues with vsync or not being able to turn off chromatic aberration - these aren't problems. My potato i7-860 and GTX750ti run this game at 60fps on ultra settings 1080p, so if you're having a problem, stop using a potato.","June 2","true","27.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The graphics enchanment is reaaly good as well (make old game looks like a new game :D !!!).\nOther than that big change in graphics and fps, there are changes  a bit in the user interface, balls collision (cannot be kicked now :( ), and billboard model (Not important but old player will know :)) )\nOther than those, I have not seen any difference so far (I might update the review later).\nStill the same Dead Island that I like.\nSo, IMO, if you like the Original Dead Island, this "update" with the price if you have already owned the original series will not dissapoint you !

I already owned Dead Island so buying this only costed £1.80 due to the discount. Boy was I wrong! It looks much much better! It fixes lots of the bugs and slow mouse navigation and the graphics are much better! It is on a new engine so the texture and shaders and much more better and refined and the HUD is more sharper. If you don\'t already own Dead Island buy this version as it is a overhaul of the previous. They should take down the previous version. This one is also much cheaper and still comes with all the DLC/ Extras.

It looks something between a remake and remaster which is fine by me as I loved the style of the original dead island. Reflections, shadows and lightning are more high fidelity now and textures have been enhanced but not to the point that it looks like a different game and the most important thing to me is the view distance slider which was absent in the original pc port.\n\nI recommend turning off the chroma and film grain effects as they seem to only make the visuals look fuzzier. Also I´d hope they would tell what kind of anti aliasing method they are using and few other anti aliasing choices wouldn´t be bad for future patch. And lastly I would love to see the one puch mod in the game. It seems like you only get the mod if you buy the dead island and dead island riptide package, what´s up with that?\n\nOverall I can see myself sinking hours into this fun and now amazing looking masterpiece.","June 1","true","14.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Runs better than the original despite the graphical update\n-Only 3 Dollar upgrade if you own the original, and comes with DLC\n-Far less buggy\n-Same old Dead Island experience\n\nCons:\n-Same old Dead Island experience\n\nIf you like Dead Island games like the original, Riptide or Dying Light, and you own the original and feel replaying the game, then the 3 dollar upgrade is 100% worth it. If you have playing the original on console, or bought it after the shut off, then it's not worth buying again. Like I previously said, it's still the same old Dead Island experience, so you aren't getting anything new, so it's not worth rebuying. If this is your first Deep Silver zombie game, then this (or Dying Light) is definitely the place to start, and with a 20 dollar price tag, you can't really go wrong. If you're hesitant, wait for the summer sale. This will more than likely be like 5 bucks during the sale, and it's definitely worth picking up then.","June 2","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fortunately this is not the case at all. To me this feels like an entirely brand new 2016 AAA game because of how good it looks and runs. I didnt realize it was a full port to the new dying light engine.\n\nLaugh if you want but i think i might like this games graphics better than dying lights. I think its because dead island 1 is not as open-world so the visuals are a bit more focused. But it truly does look amazing on the new engine. I never realized how much vegetation diversity/object detail dead island 1 has\n\nIm getting 90fps rock solid (60fps steady with vsync enabled) on my med-high end rig and i am so happy about how optimized it is for such a detail rich game. Its like dense in detail. There is so much crisp HD stuff to look at. I personally think it looks  better than dying light. Dying light didnt have as much vegetation variety and had terrible distance graphics.\n\nThe second you step outside you are like "oh yeah.." because you just know.. This is going to be a good time.\n\nFortunately for me i never had the time to play dead island 1 or dead island riptide (i did own them however so i did get to enjoy the discount) so this is truly a perfect opportunity to enjoy both great games.\n\nThe only con i have with the game is that i dont really like this games vsync being enabled, it makes the game feel like its only running at 30fps when it clearly shows 60\n\ni5 6600k\n16GB  DDR4 (2x8gb 3000mhz)\nR9 390X Nitro 8GB\n500GB EVO850 SSD\n750W 80plus Gold psu","May 31","true","38.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Seems they released the HD version with better graphics and gameplay first, then released the original version a few years later.\n\nThis version has weird frame drops and graphical glitches, low-res NPC textures, cheap blood effects and trippy lighting issues.  It also has bugs that weren't in the original, worse physics and broken hitboxes that can get you stuck in a room because you don't fit through the door on the way out.  Plus when you're not sprinting, you handle like both of your legs are broken and can't seem to walk straight without an extreme input lag.\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy the real HD version; the one that came out years ago.\n\nEDIT: So since everybody else seems to worship the damn thing, I figured I'd keep playing a while longer to see if it gets any better aaaand, no.  It actually gets worse.\n\nThe screwy hitboxes aren't limited to doors, you'll get stuck inside of boulders just by brushing against them.  Enemies will also get stuck on boulders and will actually fall through the map... when they don't just die for no reason.  The cancerous Motion Blur just won't turn off even if you turn it off in the options, and the entire screen becomes a blurry mess whenever you start sprinting.  And speaking of sprinting, if you sprint too long your character will literally start looking at the world through rose-tinted lenses.  Finally, the "enhanced" navigation system will tell you to go through walls, and point to the goal in a straight line ignoring everything inbetween... I hope you're good at swimming.\n\nGame is complete and absolute garbage, avoid it at all costs and just get the original.","May 31","false","3.2"," 14 of 40 people (35%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","35","14","40","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poppycop/recommended/383150/","poppycop","Poppycop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poppycop/","842 products in account","As far as game remasters go, this one is solid. Not only does it remove the 'wonky' feeling of the original, it also goes the extra mile to make the game feel more responsive giving attacks that certain 'oomph' that is always satisfying. The game doesn't have the stuttering issues found in the original, and also looks better and loads faster than the original game. Generally remasters for PC are pointless, this is an example of when it is fine, the engine change (Chrome Engine 5 --> Chrome Engine 6) would be a useless improvement to the overall shoddiness of the original. While the base game was very fun, the bugs and presentation overshadowed much of the experience. This remaster not only fixes a majority of the bugs, it also seems to have redone every cutscene (except the intro AFAIK). Animations and ragdolls are less floaty and more impactful.\n\nThe hefty discount given to owners of the original game make this far more acceptable as well, Dead Island Definitive Edition was $3 for people with the 2011 release. Overall, this is a remaster that improves on the gameplay and experience of the original, which is the only acceptable time to remaster a game on PC.","May 31","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is not just any old 'remaster' - this is a complete port of both Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide into the latest Dying Light game engine - and boy does it show. Three hours into Dead Island DE and I'm constantly blown away by the gorgeous visuals. Now I understand what Techland envisaged for Dead Island the first time around - but only now can their game tech truly do their vision justice.\n\nIt's hard to over-emphasise just how impressive these games now look in their new forms. I understand some people have reported issues but I have to be honest and say that even on my six year-old PC (running a lowly GTX 760 on an i7@2.80GHz with 12GB RAM) I'm able to max everything out (no compromises) and the game has, so far, been rock-solid for me. I can also report that Techland have done a solid job with the PS4 version of DI:DE, as I'm fortunate enough to own that, too. Both versions look spectacular and run without complaint.\n\nThe actual gameplay remains as hokey and yet strangely enjoyable as ever. It's Dead Island, after all, and although it may wow with it's swish new game engine and stunning lighting and vistas (and the views really are lovely), the gameplay is largely unchanged from tne originals. Menus look better organised and work perfectly well with the 360 controller on PC (my preferred way of playing). In short: if you enjoyed the gameplay of the originals you'll get exactly the same thing here, but it will all look several magnitudes better than those original versions ever did.\n\nWell done to Techland for doing this right. They weren't lazy; this is not a cash-in and the developer should be congratulated for its efforts and for its sensible pricing.\n\nHighly Recommended. Really, this sets a new benchmark for re-releasing games - more publishers should take note.","June 4","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original devs "Techland" once again return to the Dead Island series, porting gaming assets and implementing new textures/effects under their latest "Chrome Engine 6" in which their succesful 2nd open world zombie rpg "Dying Light" runs on.\n\nWhat's New ?\nThe main highlight in the definitive edition is the brand new updated graphics of course. The oddly clayish, gritty, blurry, and faded atmosphere that was once in the original Dead Island is now crisp,more detailed, and vibrant which suits the tropical theme. Even models such as npcs got a geometry/texture boost which gives them more detail and artistic personality whether they're living or infected. Not to mention, various new effects such as the lightining technology used in Dying Light has been implemented. The new lighting system vastly improves the over-all look of the world. On a side note it seems that techland added some new tweaks to their lighting technology as it includes hazy rays that can also be visible through indoor areas or just in general everywhere sort of like the early versions of Dying Light in which the retail version lacks. However, despite the new graphical changes the gameplay is pretty much the same and some new minor technical bugs exist such as chrome blood,or weird physics that makes zombie ragdolls fall even faster or the fact that you can't kick a beach ball. This is expected as the game itself is being ported to a brand new engine. On the bright side, the game seems to run smoother than the original and it seems that the major bugs had been tweaked that once plagued the original.\n\nPROS\n- Great updated/enhanced graphics\n- Fun gameplay\n- all dlc's included\n- smooth gameplay experience\n\nCONS\n- some new technical bugs\n\n\nVerdict\nDead Island: definitve edition is a true remastered game unlike other games such as "Sleeping dogs" or "HD remakes" for example. Like it's original, it is fun and thrilling especially with online players. The graphics are way better than the original which makes it 10x pleasing to venture around the zombie infested island. This is a "remaster" not a "Reboot" so don't expect new gameplay elements. I recommend this for those who are fans of Dead Island or those wanting more dead island content while waiting on the devs "Sumo Digital" to reveal new information on the upcoming sequel "Dead Island 2"; also if you never played Dead Island or Dying Light then give the definitve edtion a try. Plus the price discount is generously low for all content included.","June 4","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said if you liked it before and want to see it with some night graphic upgraded and major lighting improvements pick this up now!  If you never played it, IMO you should go ahead and add it to the cart and check out ASAP!\n\nGREAT JOB on this one!","June 4","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
