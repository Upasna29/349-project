You will start out with levels that can literally be won in seconds. Place a building or two and mission accomplished. At the end, you are given such absurdly difficult goals you will wonder if the game designers were trying to make the game unplayable (they certainly made it unenjoyable). There are very few levels to play, and time runs out quickly per level. The bulk of the game is actually spent replaying previous levels so that you will have resources you need to pass later levels.\n\nIf you like repetition and being frustrated, here's your game. If not, spend your three dollars elsewhere.","October 24, 2015","false","2.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

It has a bit of sim city vibe in the sense that the player has to make sure that each house is supported with water and power, but the levels seem fairly rigid in structure; you won't be building wondeours cities of your own design.\n\nNo, at it's heart Jane's Reality is a time management, and one that demands a frenzy of clicking at that.  There is no relaxed mode or carrying on with a level if the time runs out.  The player has to complete various goals while keeping track of tenet happiness and random events that necessitate a clean up or repair order.  It starts out slowly enough that learning the gameplay is easy enough, but I soon found out that this is a game that doesn't really like the concept of downtime or taking a moment to breath.  Think and work fast!\n\nI didn't play more than an hour when I wrote this review, so I don't know about all the  issues that might crop up.  I did encounter a situation where I one of my goals was to upgrade a house, and getting the ability to do so was difficult.  I finally figured out that you have to give enough presents to your tenents to get them to send the request, but it seemed kinds of overly random to me to get the option to full the requirement of the level.\n\nThe graphics are pretty much what one would expect from a 2008 game.  Servicable and not ugly, but hardly cutting edge either.  The sound effects are fine, and the music is easily mutable, which is how I play all my games.  It seems there are only 24 levels, but since the game only costs $2.99 that doesn't seem unreasonable.\n\nIn short, if the idea of a fairly difficult, very fast paced time management game appeals to you, then for the price this one is a solid, if not perfect, investment.\n\n6/10","October 24, 2015","true","1.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I take that last statement back because it's not very fair to facebook games as most of them are much more sorted out than this game - plus they're free.  I wouldn't play this game if it was free...","May 29","false","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
