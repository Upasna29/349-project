While I do play and enjoy games from this genre, I don't consider myself qualified to discuss the pros and cons. Understanding fighters can require long-term commitment, and their very nature changes due to techniques discovered by the players. Some of these changes can be so dramatic that the game just isn't the same anymore. So for me to review a fighter, something must be seriously wrong.\n\nOn that note, let's talk about STEEL RIVALS!\n\nAs the story goes, 18 men, women, and beasts are fighting in a tournament. The prize? A change of clothes. Now I've played a fair amount of Tekken, Soul Calibur, and Virtua Fighter. I can say without a doubt, that most of that time was spent unlocking and purchasing clothes. Playing virtual dress-up with Kung Fu Barbie will never cease to be enjoyable for me. Still, I would have liked even a semblance of a storyline. Something along the lines of "so and so hates whatever their name is, and they're going to fight to the death." Instead, if you win the tournament, your fighter says "Yay I won! Here's a new outfit for me!" Gee willickers, that's just swell...\n\nThis game is described as a 2.5D fighter, but it's more of a .5D. Just so we're clear I'm saying that STEEL RIVALS is a POINT 5D FIGHTER. You can walk forwards, backwards, attack, block, or do those Virtua Fighter 1 moon-jumps. Now depending on the character, you're going to cross off some of those maneuvers. For example: Morgan uses magic. Her strategy is going to consist entirely of jumping backwards and throwing projectiles. If the enemy gets close, she crouches and performs a spinning slide move to knock the opponent down. In order to combat this strategy, the opponent must...I don't know.\n\nTypically in fighters, projectiles are jumped over, or there's some other technique to handle players that abuse them. With this game...you block and then...you keep blocking? Maybe your opponent will get bored and try another move instead. Jumping over fireballs doesn't work, because every jump sends you soaring far over everything (including the opponent). I suppose you could try moving forward, and hope to bait out the slide-attack. Playing theory fighter is the most dangerous game of all, because in STEEL RIVALS, it all hinges on your opponent doing something tremendously stupid.\n\nThere's no reason for Morgan to put herself in any danger. She can continue to jump backwards, throw her mid-air projectiles, mix in a few while standing, and tire her opponent out. At worst she might get tapped by an attack and get knocked down, but there's little the opponent can do to capitalize. This is all due to the combo system. When you land an attack, you can press combinations of the first two attack buttons to create combos, then press the third button for a special finish(this uses meter). Unless you can land hits, you'll never get meter, but if you land hits that you can't combo off of, then it's all rendered moot.\n\nBut let's forget about Morgan for now and discuss another character. This guy's name is Sardis. For whatever silly reason, his two standing moves ignore attacks. This means his opponent could be doing anything, and he'll simply power through it and go into his combos. This should be game-breaking, but his ability as a fighter is shattered by simply blocking. His attacks have a ton of recovery time, so all you have to do is block and punish. This poor jerk doesn't have any options. He doesn't have quick light moves, a grab, or anything that could force the opponent to respect him. When you face Sardis, all you have to do is block...and punish. This is what I mean by a .5D fighter. Either you perform the one move that can defeat your opponent, or you don't. That is how wins and losses are decided.\n\nSome other characters (like Maya) get dive-kicks and/or really fast attacks. Now I won't claim that my STEEL RIVALS skills are good enough for EVO but I think my dive-kick + combo into finisher strats could at least get me to grand finals. Again, this is because there aren't any decent methods for getting out of combo traps. Some characters can perform special evasive moves or counters, but that requires meter. As I said earlier, meter comes from landing hits. Maya is going to be moon-jumping and dive-kicking all the time, even if the opponent blocks everything, she can just jump out of the way and try again. Some other characters have nothing but slow moves, or they only hit high instead of mid or low. At this point they're just plain sad. All that can be said about them is: Why even wake up? You were designed for failure.\n\nAdmittedly I haven't spent a lot of time with everyone. I won a few tournaments with some of the female fighters because uh...well I was hoping they'd win some clothes. Not different clothes...just...you know...clothes...because a couple of them are wearing practically nothing. This made the tourney victories all the more bittersweet, because their new outfits tended to be even more revealing. I can't even appreciate the titillation because everyone looks like they're made out of plastic. Maya's hair is yarn for crying out loud.\n\nSTEEL RIVALS has a loooooooooong way to go before it can be considered being worth anywhere near $15. The game looks like a low-budget Soul Calibur, but has all the complexity of a Karate Champ prequel. Your time and money are better spent elsewhere.","December 18, 2015","false","4.1"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","37","42","6","5"

Its really simple once you know the attack patern. There are just 2 basic attacks and with that you can just spam attack your enemies. I like that all characters have different moves though but there isn't anything in this game that you won't get from others.\n\nHere is an video in wich you already can see many things that are wrong with this game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw9izWXqhMY\n\nIt would have been good if it was an free online browser game. This game is nowhere near worth the asking price and looks like an early acces games. If you really want this game just wait when it becomes $1 soon enough.","November 22, 2015","false","0.6"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

The game also allows you to easily break world records in Survival Mode, where the the high score charts are as barren math class during the summer holidays.\n\nIt's probably a perfect game for satirical youtube videos, especially if you want to showcase my waifu Morgan, and her incredibly broken fireball zoning in a game where no one else has fireballs. Or struggle with my husbando - the hilariously named Minotaurus Rex - who sports the slowest swings in the game and cannot even jump!\n\nOverall, a terrible game with awful controls, broken mechanics, sub-par animation and appaling character balance that is almost saved a couple of cool character designs, surprisingly well thought-out modes, passable stages and decent music. If you're a masochist like me, you can definitely get a couple of hours worth of ironic fun out of Steel Rivals - but if you want a decent fighter, literally every other fighting game currently on Steam is better.","May 22","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Sure there are many chooseable characters, they all look awesome (especially the female ones ;)), But in the game it just feels...old, maybe it's the fighting background, or the colour is too greyish, not sure. The actual fighting part is ok, dev can certainly try to add more moves and combo, but overall it's not bad. It has different game modes and each character has a second look to unlock. I think this game has a lot of potential, with some more fixing and update it would be great.","November 22, 2015","true","1.9"," 8 of 80 people (10%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","10","8","80","8","0"
