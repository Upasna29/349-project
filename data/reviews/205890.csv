In this game you face off against your own cards and your rival. Playing this game from the first week of closed beta all the way to its release really does show you that it has its own replayability. The meta shifts and the game has that feel of a "perfect imbalance" Once one playstyle gets too strong there is another playstyle that arises to counter it.\n\nIf you are out there looking for a new card game to play give this game a try. They are constantly doing updates for this game and you don't have to be a old or current runescape player to enjoy the gameplay.\n\nPros:Only had to link my steam account with my chronicle account once. Then every launch afterwards was instantly to the menu.\nThe gameplay is really rewarding if you play every day as the daily quests feel really easy to finish.\nIf you decide to play this game as a free to player then it is actually be really rewarding for that playstyle.\nDungeoneering draft mode is a very rewarding gamemode, the deeper you get into a dungeon draft the harder and more rewarding the game gets. When you get to 7 wins out of 12 in a dungeoneering draft it gives you enough currency for a free dungeoneering run.\n\nCons:The game has some noticeable bugs at times, But they are working on patches for those noticeable bugs.\nThere are some very strong diamond cards out there.\nThe challenge other players system is a bit odd at times, quite a few bugs with this.","May 26","true","115.9"," 107 of 126 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","107","126","6","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InterjectionVideos/recommended/205890/","InterjectionVideos","Interjection","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InterjectionVideos/","9 products in account","GameplayA game plays out by placing four cards onto the board for your RuneScape character to encounter. Because your character starts with low stats, your initial goal is to train them up by encountering small creatures to fight - you fight the cards you’ve chosen and claim the ‘loot’ written on the card after it’s killed. There are all kinds of loot (stats, armour, ‘draw a card’, etc) that help level up your character but the most common reward is gold. You spend gold in a similar way to ‘mana’ on cards that offer useful effects. As the match progresses and your character becomes stronger your strategy might be to spend gold on expensive weapons and armour to help take down massive RuneScape Boss monsters with potent game defining loot/effects (Corp, Jad, Zulrah, Zillyana, etc). Or... instead of putting those in your deck, your strategy might be to be more aggressive and instead spend your gold on spells that let you strike and deal damage to your opponent directly (you win the game when your opponent runs out of HP and there are many different ways to achieve that).\n\nAs a strategy experienceI enjoy Chronicle because it feels like you are always making lots of meaningful strategic decisions. You play and draw many more cards compared to most other CCGs (e.g., MtG/HS) and as a result it feels like you always have more options and freedom with every turn. In my experience so far, this facilitates an enormous amount of scope for deckbuilding as the game inherently focuses more on building your character, your agenda and ultimately, YOUR strategy. You don’t get shoehorned into doing stuff as much, like playing on ‘curve’ (creatures don’t cost mana in Chronicle) or being forced into a certain line of play/’trade’. Decision making is spent elsewhere into your character’s strategy against your own deck which in my mind exponentially increases the variety of ways to play and combo cards relative to other games. With that said though, competitive matches like in any CCG do still require you to plan your turn optimally based on the matchup, the cards left in your deck, the cards your opponent could play, has played and will play, etc, etc - Chronicle is no exception and with a fully fleshed out ‘bronze’, ‘silver’, ‘gold’, ‘platinum’ and ‘diamond’ ladder there’s a space to find evenly matched opponents regardless of your skill level or the size of your collection (or theirs...)\n\nBusiness ModelThe game’s business model, like almost all CCGs is that you purchase card packs with real money. Excluding promotional offers, if you buy the largest bundles, individual packs work out to be about £0.39 / $0.58 / 0.52€ each. Having collected 3000 packs worth of spreadsheet data (from watching videos/streams of pack openings) the statistics I ran show that on average 110ish packs will net you 2 copies of every common card in the game and 1 of each uncommon (assuming you recycle/de your extras and spend all of the shards/dust on crafting the ones you didn’t get). From those packs you’ll also get a good number of rares and about 3.5ish ‘legendaries’ as well. Of course, the game is still having content added and in a few weeks the first of several new playable legends/heroes will be added to the game… this represents the addition of several more card which will of course make my statistics in accurate until I rerun them. I’ll be releasing my pack data soon in a video (https://www.youtube.com/c/interjectionChronicle).\n\nF2P ModelThe F2P model is fair as well, you get rewarded with packs quite quickly to begin with by just playing the game e.g., for beating the practice mode on each difficulty setting, for leveling up your legends/heroes to unlock the basic cards and eventually a free pack, for being promoted a league in play mode, for claiming one free admission to ‘dungeoneering’ (the draft mode), etc, etc. I’ll stop there because this isn’t a guide but I will mention that the daily & weekly quest system in combination with the coins you earn each time you win a game max out at just over one pack per day for free. I’ve personally collected exactly 103 packs from simply playing the game organically since March 16th when the game entered early access (https://twitter.com/Interjection_/status/735831534402424832), though I do pride myself on being quite good at Dungeoneering and I’ve played lots of if (which has helped tremendously with progression).\n\nTL;DRIf you enjoy card games or tabletop boardgames then Chronicle is definitely well worth checking out. It’s a whole new unique world of unexplored CCG strategy with tons of potential.\n\nI hope this review was useful to you.","May 26","true","204.0"," 81 of 93 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","81","93","0","0"

It's nothing like Hearthstone or Magic, it offers a whole new set of rules that you can explore and master.\n\nThe GameplayAs mentioned above, this game is nothing like Hearthstone or Magic, as far as I'm aware, there aren't other games that use this style. Each game consists of 5 Chapters, and each Chapter you can play up to 4 cards.\nAs with all card games, you start with a hand drawn from your deck. You do not play cards directly against your opponent. Rather, you play cards against yourself. Let me go into a bit more detail on this.\n\nAll Legends start off with 2 base attack, 30 health and 0 gold. Gold is used to 'pay' for weapons, armour and other effects. You gain gold either by slaying creatures, or other support cards. Certain cards can be used to directly strike your opponent, which will help you  in the final battle. It is possible, and often very worth it, to raise your base attack, as all weapons in the game can only be used a certain amount of time before breaking. The final battle is an event that occurs when you reach the 5th area of the 5th Chapter. As the name implies, you and your foe beat each other senseless until one stops moving and explodes.\n\n\nThe ModesAs with Hearthstone, there are several game modes that you can take part in. Sadly, while the names vary from Hearthstone, the effect is the same.\n\nSolo lets you test new decks against each of the classes in the game, and give a few Steam Achievments for completing them.\n\nCasual lets you play against other players with nothing but your pride on the line.\n\nRanked lets you play against players of similar skill and lets you climb the ladder.\n\nDungeoneering is like the Arena in Hearthstone; You get to choose from a few random cards to build a new deck to face off against other players that built new decks on the spot.\n\n\nThe BadSadly, getting booster packs on this game is pretty hard unless you pay for them, and some of the high tier cards are pretty crazy. Some daily quests give you 40 coins, while some give you 200. Epic Quests tend to double or triple that.\nThe problem is, buying a booster will cost you 1000 coins.\n\nThere are some level up rewards, but in my opinion it doesn't justify the insane cost of cards.\nThat being said, there are no quest-ecxlusive cards that give an unfair edge like Naxx in Hearthstone, and Jagex still have to make money out of this. So honestly speaking, if you like the game, feel free to spend a bit of money on it. If you don't, you'll still be able to have fun as you play!\n\nNow, I'm not sure of this next one is the game's fault or mine, but the resolution seems a bit fuzzy, even at its highest settings. Though I only have a GTX 650 for a graphics card, so this might be a problem on my end. Either way, it's not nearly enough to deter me from this gem of a game.\n\nWell done, Jagex, keep it up!\nI'm looking forward to your Idle Adventures game!","May 29","true","2.8"," 62 of 70 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","62","70","3","0"

There's much more to this game, such as card effects and weapons, that build upon certain strategies.\n\nIn each game, there are 5 chapters, and in each of those chapters, you can play up to 4 cards and battle monsters, accumulate gold, etc. (You'll be playing a maximum of 20 of your 30-card deck.)

I'd honestly compare this game more to the Talisman board game than I would Hearthstone. Chronicle uses cards but it doesn't FEEL like a card game. It feels like a strategy game that happens to have cards.\n\nPros:\n+ Great variation on a CCG that doesn't detract from the CCG aspect\n+ Game feels rewarding to play, and has enough up-front, visible depth to keep you playing until you learn the game\n+ Nice art style\n+ Free to play\n\nCons:\n- Opponent character idle animations cycle often and are annoying until you learn to ignore them\n- Matchmaking will sometimes match you with higher level players and players with much better and more cards than you (standard pvp matchmaking issues essentially)\n- Earning coins is intentionally slowed via dailies and capped to discourage long play sessions, after 20 wins you can gamble your coins in Dungeoneering (once you unlock it) but may get nothing for it\n- F2P card packs are expensive, building a custom deck could take a few weeks even with luck\n\n\nNotes:\n*Once you hit level 10, getting coins is a little easier and you can get about 1,400 coins/day - a pack costs 1000 coins so at this point you get one "free" pack a day if you put in a couple of hours to do dailies.\n- UI is similar to Hearthstone's but feels... off somehow (i'd call this a con but it's not a big issue)\n+ If you use a strong deck, you can make a lot of coins from Dungeoneering (each continuous wins will net you increasingly more coins), but without spending money on card packs, it will take a while to get a deck good enough to do so.\n\n\nOverall rating with less than 5 hours play time: 7.5/10\nApproximate rating after 20 hours play time: 6.5/10\n\n\nI definitely recommend that you try this game out, and don't spend any money on it until you've played at least 20 hours.","May 28","true","19.0"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","3"

The opponent does the same and whoever has the better strategy or buffs himself up to the top will win the game.\n\nThis is a huge difference from Hearthstone. While Hearthstone focuses on a direct interaction with the opponent (except OTK), Runescape Chronicles doesn't. You can, of course, destroy your opponents hand, harm him and so on. But since you put four cards into the board before knowing what he will play, it's more about doing the best possible play for yourself.\n\nThe gameplay is absolutely different and unique - I love it!\n\nGraphics\n\nLooks a bit like the Runescape client. Not the best graphics, but not bad either. I can imagine they made it this way for a future implementation on mobile devices.\n\nInterface\n\nIt's obvious that the developers copied from Hearthstone here. The sounds and interface will remind you of HS. The card collection, card backs, crafting system and so on. You even  have the arena system in which you can go up to 12 wins...\n\nCost\n\nThe game itself is free to play and I'd say it "costs" about the same as other cardgames, e.g. Hearthstone. One pack costs 1000 coins what will take you 1 - 2 days to earn. You can craft the remaining cards and from what I've heard, there are f2p players in the Top10 aswell. It's a fair system. You can enjoy it without spending money, and the earlier you begin your journey, the easier will it be to keep up with the meta.\n\nLast Words\n\nThere are similarities with Blizzards well known card game - you just can't deny it.\nDoes this make it a clone or bad game?\nAbsolutely not! The gameplay mechanics are unique, the setting is nice and the prices are fair.\nIf you like card games in general or are a (ex) Runescape player, this one definitely is for you!\n\nTry it out\n\n9/10","May 26","true","24.5"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","3"

At the end of the 5 rounds both players, if they're still alive, fight eachother, using the stats they accumulated during the game.

This leads to some interesting matchups, since while you know what a player may be building towards as a certain class, they can also mix and match cards from a pool common to all classes.\n\nI'm not much of a card game player but the combination of RPG and TCG mechanics works very well, resulting in a very enjoyable game.","May 26","true","8.8"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","23","33","0","0"

YES. Absolutely YES. What are you waiting for? It’s Free to Play, and amazingly fun!I’ve done quite some videos on my Youtube channel, so see for yourself!:\nChronicle: Runescape Legends - The F2P Way\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C55oADdm05c&index=1&list=PLDV2WEUIxlYPD_l28fPXyN3USxC5lWmgZ\nLong answer:Chronicle: Runescape Legends,at first sight, appears to be a ‘clone’ of the famous game Heartstone. BUT… if you take just a second to look up some information, you’ll quickly notice that Chronicle, is ANYTHING BUT Heartstone. In my eyes… it’s better, soo much better. As a player who started in the closed beta, who has played Heartstone and MtG AND who has been recording episodes regularly, I can know.\n\nChronicle: Runescape Legends makes use of the established lore and creatures found in the main game, Runescape. A title well known by many. A lot of monsters and NPC’s have a card inside Chronicle, and more are comming. Heartstone also started with a few cards, and expanded over time, just like how Chronicle will.\n\nNow… onto the biggest thing that makes Chronicle unique… It’s playstyle. In every other online or real life card game that I know, you place down monsters which you summon with mana, and use them to kill your opponent and his summoned monsters. Chronicle however, takes a completely different approach, the route of questing. Start your game by creating a deck of around 30-35 cards out of your collection, and enter the battlefield.\nYou play on a field with 4 card slots, on which you can ‘create your own quest’ by placing down adventure/support cards which have certain benefits for a ‘gold price’, and you can place down monster cards, which your own Legend will have to defeat.\nYou are playing as your own Legend, buffing your attack, using weapons to kill the creatures you face in your quest, whilst you traverse 5 chapters. There are enough cards in the game that dirrectly affect the opponent. You can deal damage to them, steal their gold or even buff one of their creatures they have to face. There is a massive amount of interaction between the two players. At the end of chapter 5, if you managed to survive till that point, the two legends will face off in a final battle. Your Attack Power and Weapon are calculated in the damage you deal, whilst players take turns to hit eachother in the face. Last Man/Legend Standing wins.\n\nNow… ofcourse a Free to Play game like this will have Microtransactions, which are found in the ability to buy card packs with real-life-money. But… the good part about a game like this.. is that it is also very possible to collect and expand your card collection through a F2P way, just like what I’m doing in my own playthrough. There are 5 daily quests you can complete to obtain some Copper Coins, which is the F2P currency to buy card packs. Besides that, you can get some copper coins as a reward for your 1st, 3rd, 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th win against another player. All combined, you are looking at an avarage of around 1 card pack a day, completely free. If you find it too slow and want more cards, then there is the option to buy ‘platinum ingots’ which can be used to buy card packs in bulk, or give yourself a nice card back.\n\nAll in all, Chronicle: Runescape Legends is a very fun and adictive game to play, and I’d HIGHLY advise you to give it a try for yourself, then you can judge if you like it or not.\n\nA small tip fors tarting players… Try and beat all the AI ranks first. You’ve got Bronze, Silver and Gold, and if you manage to beat every single Legend in a tier, you will be awarded a card pack, together with a decent amount of Copper coins the first time you beat them. Enough to get you started on a brand new adventure.\n\nMAKE YOUR OWN STORY WITH CHRONICLE: RUNESCAPE LEGENDS!\n~Voltorn Elda – Sincerus Entertainment","May 26","true","19.4"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","25","39","0","2"

I've more than once turned a game completely around and more than once seen a game turn on me.

You don't actually battle your opponent directly until the end of an adventure, or 'quest'. Your hand is literally your adventure. You have to earn gold each round to buy buffs, weapons, effects, armor, even debuffs for monsters you place (that you have to fight yourself).\n\nMonsters give effects based on how powerful they are, some of the strongest monsters will give you permanent buffs for the remainder of the match, nuke your opponents health or even double your gold. Depending how you fare on your journey, which weapons and armors you played and what monsters you faced determine how powerful (or how good as dead) you are for the final duel.\n\nCard packs are quite expensive with in game currency however, and it does seem there are some VERY powerful cards not available from just leveling classes. Although you can disenchant cards for dust which you use to craft anything of your choice, better the card; more dust you need. You can also create custom decks based around Runescape heroes. There's a mage who harasses the enemy hero during their quest, a warrior who can become insanely tanky and even deal damage and heal based on his armor amount and a vampire who can drain monsters and her enemy for healing and inflict extremely high damage when close to death. There is also a rogue and a blacksmith but I haven't tried them, I've not seen either of those classes do well however.\n\nIt's a short download, free, and very fast to learn thanks to a no nonsense tutorial. I would recommend this to any TCG/CCG, strategy and even RPG fan.","May 28","true","2.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The objective is to defeat your opponent through either direct or indirect means, but you have to use your cards wisely!\n\nGameplay:\nA game lasts for 5 chapters and each legend plays differently, in each chapter you can place down a maximum of 4 cards and there are two card types; Monster and Ally cards. Monsters are creatures your legend encounters and must fight for benefits to try and get the upper hand against your opponent, these benfits can be weapons, which temporarily boosts your attack or boosts to your base attack, health rewards, money for paying for ally cards, and armor that can be used to protect your health from attacks. But be careful! As many cards have side-effects, one example is the white wolf card, which upon defeating gives you two cards but causes you to recieve 2 damage even if you were unharmed in the fight. This can cause many different gamble situations that can potentially put you on top.\n\nThere are some balancing problems and so far there's only 5 legends","May 28","true","7.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

This game is the reason my Hearthstone card-back collection is no longer complete, I've not actually touched any other CCG since this games release because they can't provide me with the thrill and experience CRL does and that is what keeps me playing.\n\nI could sit here and write paragraph after paragraph telling you why you should play this game but i honestly find that experiencing it first hand is better than reading lines of my dribble.

Fun and adventurous take on card-gaming. Definitely has some tie-ins to the lore of Runescape the MMO in which I practiced grade-school escapism (years later realised the name of the game can be interpreted as offering just that - escaping from whatever problems for a good while). And the lore and feel is really fun and joyous, brings fond memories.\n\nAside all that, this game brings new deep mechanics to the fray. Whilst still maintaining accessability. Can be enjoyed both casually and competitively, or even as a time-sink for farming new cards, for new ways of playing. Which isn't too bothersome - quests are many, offering good gp.\n\nA more deep game than Hearthstone perhaps, yet much more streamlined than MTG.

The graphics, the mechanics of the game and even the sounds just all work. Its one of those games were a win feels so satisfying and i loss is irritating but it doesnt make me want to quit, it just encourages me to play more, get some new cards, re-work my deck to amend the errors ive made before, plus there is the option to BUY packs for cards but it is in no means neccesary, this game is no were near a pay to win, its just an option if you want to progress and tiny bit quicker, but the rate of unlocking cards just by playing the game is very quick anyway.\n\nok so some details on how the game works as such:\n\nThere are 5 legends (Characters) and each one has their own special skill set e.g. Blacksmith, Mage, Tank and they have cards that are specific to them, the rest of the deck is made up of general cards that any legend has access too. So you create your deck in a way you feel is best for the way you play, wether you like to play very agressive throughout the chapters or if you like to build your stats up ready for the final fight (ill get to this bit soon)\n\nonce your deck has been made youre are now ready to go, you can start of playing against the AI (reccomeded for practice) on three levels; Bronze, Silver & Gold, rewards are still picked up for beating AI opponents. You can also play Casual matches, these are just like "friendly" matches against online players to "test your decks and skill" (as said in game) and finally there is the Ranked Matches. You start off in Bronze Division, get 10 wins and you move to silver, Silver division you need 25 to gold and these go up through Gold and then finally to Platinum. Although it sounds simple to say "well i only need to win 25 games? easy" yes it may be, but when you lose again, you essientally lose a win, making winning the games that much more important.\n\nnow onto the gameplay. Each match consits of 5 Chapters and at the end of the 5th chapter is the final fight, within each chapter both players can play a maximum of 4 cards. Cards are dealt at the begginging of the game, each player is handed 6 cards from their deck and can decide if they want to swap any cards for another in their deck, then it is decided who will go 1st and who will go 2nd, those who are picked 2nd are given 1 extra card to start. Now that the cards have been dealt the game is ready to start. Each player has a "Stats Bar", these show your Weapon Stats (Attack/Durability) shown as a fraction, your base attack (which is what your character will hit as without a weapon, shown as a number in fire), The amount of gold you have (obviously shown as a number in gold coins), your health (Shown as a number inside a heart, which is maxed at 30) and finally your armour (Shown as a number inside a shield). All of these stats will change depending on the cards that are played during the game and ultimately having an effect on the final fight, if you are still alive for it.\n\nAt the end of Chapter 5, you and your opponent battle it out, no cards, just you and your stats. The stats that you had gathered or lost throughout the 5 chapters are all used here. If you end Chapter 5 with (2 Base attack, 1 Gold, 12 Health, 3 Armour) then that is what you take into the fight, so it is important that through the chapters you give yourself the best chance of winning the fight based on your stats against your opponents (Note. it is possible to defeat your oppenent during the chapters and the game finishing there without the need of a final fight)\n\nWhen the fight is over (After one of you has hit their animated final hit) the match has ended and you will have been victorious or defeated, either way you will still earn XP, just the amounts vary from the outcome and with this you will earn cards and coins which can be used for packs or to play the dungoneering feature.\n\nI havent played the dungeoneering feature much so i cant go into much detail but its essientally a drafting system. You start the dungeon (after paying the 1500 copper coins entry fee, free for first time players) and are welcomed with a screen of 2 random legends and you have to pick one. Once you have decided on the legend you wish to play as there are then 15 "Draft Rounds" in which you pick 2 cards out of a possible 5 to create your deck. Once the 15 rounds are complete and your deck is ready you will enter the dungeon in room 1. You are then put against an online player in a match, the winner of that match progresses through to the next room, aswell as a reward for each room complete. If you lose the game you have 3 lives to complete the dungeon so losing the first match isnt a major issue, it is still possible to go on and complete all the room, in which i think, although dont quote me on it, that there is 12 rooms in total, At the end of the 12th room there is a big prize.\n\nI think that this is pretty much all i have to say, alot of it i know, but i thought i'd be good to give a full explanation for those who are unsure wether to download and to be honest, its a free to play game, if you dont like it then your no worse of, other than a few GB of memory on your hard-drive,\n\nI hope you found the review helpful, and enjoy playing.\n\nMasoN","June 5","true","34.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game, unlike similar games *cough* don't rely much on luck. Here, you have to anticipate your opponents plays and play your own cards accordingly. You don't just simply play your cards against your opponents cards, no. You face your own cards, which will give you advantages whist they can weaken or even land the killing blow on your opponent, given that you survive your plays.\nAll in all this game is great fun. Play it casually or dive deeper into it -  you're going to have a great time either way given that you're into card- and/or strategy games. Not to mention the Runescape nostalgia trip you might be having.\n\nThe devs have also been quick to fix any given issues in the past and I don't doubt that this will continue in the future. The community is welcoming - so if you're a new player and uncertain about anything you're guaranteed to find help.\n\nI'd say give it a try yourself - it is free after all so there's no harm in forming your own impression.","May 26","true","20.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

So now I'm going to ramble on about why this game is great and all, but if you're familiar with what the game actually is you can skip this next section.\n\nWhat is Chronicle: RuneScape Legends, a.k.a. RS Chronicle?  Well, I'm glad you asked!  RS Chronicle is a card game consisting of 5 chapters, of 4 slots each where one must play cards to set out on an adventure with your rival.  This game is unique in that unlike in other card games such as Hearthstone or Yu-Gi-Oh you play enemies for yourself to defeat and reap those rewards.  With these rewards, you can spend various stats, most commonly gold, to buy supports.  If both players survive until the end, a final fight will occur.\n\nThis game has the look and atmosphere of a mix between Hearthstone and a board game, and it pits the player inside the RS world of Gielinor.  It also is somewhat consistent with a few of the quests like Dragon Slayer, the very pinnacle of the F2P experience in RS.  Play Wormbrain, remove up to 2 gold (a real bargain since in RS he charges 10000 gp), and put Elvarg into your hand (who is a female BTW).  AND you get to skip Melzar's Maze.  So, yeah, it does include some of that RS charm from the classic MMORPG.\n\nTHE BEST PART IS PARTY HATS COST 0 GOLD SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD ONE.\n\n10/10 would stagger grief again","May 26","true","38.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Instead of battling your opponent you battle your own cards and sometimes your cards can damage your opponent or mess with their cards (referred to as griefing) which adds an elemennt of strategy and thought that is missing from many card games currently out there.  You play 4 cards in each "chapter" and there are 5 chapters per game which means you can play a total of 20 cards out of your deck which is a minimum of 30 cards.  Once you place the cards you and your opponent battle your way through that chapter and you can no longer interact or play cards until the chapter resolves.  With all that in mind all your choices matter and you have to think carefully about how to place your cards while also taking into consideration what cards your opponent might play.\n\nAll the elements of other online CCG's can be found in this game as well.  They have the casual and ranked play modes as well as the draft mode called Dungeoneering that you pay to enter with either the ingame currency or real money currency.  The ranked system has different tiers of Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond and there are ranked seasons which seem to last about a month and you earn rewards at the end based on the rank you achieve.  They also of course have packs that you can buy with either ingame coins you earn from Dungeoneering or daily quests and the option to buy them with real money as well.  The only cosmetic items you can buy are the card backs and you can also earn card backs from playing ranked seasons, but there are currently no card backs you can buy with the ingame coin currency.\n\nAs far as the whole Runescape theme I know that can be a positive or negative thing for some people.  I never played Runescape but I still find the game very fun just as a standalone card game although I am sure Runescape players will pick up on all the fun references and characters that carry over.  Even if you don't like Runescape but you like card games I would still recommend trying this out since the fact that it is related to Runescape has zero impact on the game.\n\nOverall it is a solid and fun game that plays very differently from the competition.  Many of the features will seem familliar if you are coming from a game like Hearthstone for example but I can assure you this is not a clone in the slightest.  If you are a fan of CCG's or Runescape in general I highly recommend trying this out.","May 26","true","64.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am massively disappointed by this :(\n\nWow! This game! Amazing. Truelly, truelly amazing. I'm a tad concerned by the ability to buy SO MANY card packs with purchasable currency, but then, I haven't (and won't) be doing that and I'm not having too much trouble (yet) playing against others (got a ~80% win rate thus far). Hopefully it will stay this way..\n\nI find the obtainable currency somewhat.. well.. hard to get. I've played 6 hours and earned about 1500; that's it. So, not sure what it will be like (maybe I've missed something) but this seems the only downside for me currently.\n\nThe art style is beautiful, and the playstyle is even better. The idea that you are little figures with your opponents real-life person in the background cheering it on etc, is actually really appealing and pleasing to watch as the game progresses. At first I thought it was a cheap way of avoiding graphics (maybe it is) but it works and I love it!\n\nYou are limited to 2 legends (characters) at first, but unlocking the other 4 may take you 30 minutes - Not exactly a problem (I think it only does this to introduce you easier). Basic tutorial teaches you almost everything you need to know to play comfortably.\n\nMusic is a little repetative, but it is pleasent at the same time. It sits in the background and adds to the game flow, rather than being obvious and annoying.\n\nI believe it only came out today, so I'm EXTREMELY pleased with it's progress. 0 bugs so far, very well optimised (though it is a fairly basic game) and due to the randomness of card selection (from a deck you can build) the game is never really the same either.\n\nGames take between 5-15 minutes depending, so it's great for jumping in and out off. You also start with a fair amount of cards for each legend so that is also good :)\n\nI'd recommend this for any card game lover! 9/10","May 26","true","11.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is the only one I've played in the past few years that's REALLY different from Hearthstone in terms of actual gameplay, and is actually good.\n\nThe premise here is that instead of deploying minions to attack your opponent like in every other CCG, you play minions which you must do combat with to increase your own stats, weapons, and gold.  After turn 5 (games are short, but satisfying), you'll use whatever weapons and attack upgrades you have to slug it out with your opponent until someone is dropped to 0 health.\n\nNote, however, that games often end before the final battle because you and your opponent will likely try to damage each other and complicate each other's battles before the final showdown.  For example, maybe your opponent has a default attack of 2, +3 attack from a weapon, with 1 durabillity left on the weapon.  You play a card to reduce his weapon durabillity by 2, eliminating his weapon.  He already committed to attacking his 8 attack, 5 health, card expecting to take it down in one round.  But without his weapon, he's forced into 3 rounds of combat, and dies to his own card.\n\nThe only real negative I can report is that the combat animations can be slow at times.  This this more of a problem when playing against the computer than when playing against a human, since against a live opponent, you can use the few extra seconds to think about your next turn.  My concern is that this could be an annoyance to new players who are only playing the computer to grind out some free cards, but it's not as big a deal once you're playing real games.\n\nBottom line, if you like CCGs, I suspect you'll like this one.","May 28","true","38.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Don't let the screenshots or general UI fool you, this is not piggybacking Hearthstone to any strong degree. It's more of a strategy game wherein cards are enemies and spells that your hero must face, and even use to attack your opponent. To win the game you must keep your hero alive longer than your opponent. If both you and your opponent survive until the end, you face off, attacking with your damage stat you've been building all game in turn until one falls. This can make matches quite intense, as you have to plan ahead for your eventual clash.\n\nAlthough I haven't played Runescape in a long while, I do know that these 'Heroes' have slowly been filtering into the game the past 5 years or so, so seeing them playing with little DnD miniatures of themselves is pretty funny. The cards have references to characters and quests that I remember from my early days on Runescape, and it makes me feel very at home. I do hope microtransactions don't ruin this game, as I can see it having a stable future.","May 29","true","3.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

However, dont look at it as a Hearthstone clone because the mechanics are really different. It's fun and simple to play. I dont have enough experience in the game to say if it's P2W or not, but it doesnt look so.\n\nIn Chronicle: RuneScape Legends you dont need to grind really hard to get booster packs because you can get 75 points for every offline win against bots and buy a booster pack for 1000 points. Yes, you can buy the in-game currency with real money but, like Hearthstone, I don't think that's going to have a significant inpact in the game.\n\nOn a final note, Chronicle: RuneScape Legends is a fun and fast game to play casually if you have some free time.","May 26","true","0.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You chose a hero, and play your cards out against your hero as they "adventure" across the board along with the enemy hero. The cards hinder and help the hero, fighting a monster card may injure the hero, but earn gold to be used to make a purchase from another card down the line. Cards have a variety of effects when completed, such as healing/ harming yourself or others, granting or removing armor, attack, or weapon stats, or even initiating a duel with the enemy hero. At the end of 5 "boards" or levels if both heroes are still standing they duel to see who wins.

Its a truly unique card game, far different from anything else out there right now.\n\nThe core concept is you aren't a summoner, you are an adventurer. The cards you play are encountered by YOUR legend, and they fight and interact with them. You play the game in 5 chapters, 4 cards per chapter, and end in a fight with your rival if you haven't already killed them. Cards have effects, stat rewards (gold, armour, attack, weapons), or a combination of them. As you play cards, you build up your base stats and can play ever more powerful combos.\n\nThe chapter limit means that games don't last a long time, and forces you to think strategically about what you play and when. Every card counts, more so than in other games. Even the basic decks you get from the tutorial have little "filler" cards. Relatively short games means you can always find time in the day to squeeze in a few matches, and claim the generous daily quest rewards.\n\n\nI've played many other card games in the past and in all honesty, none of them compare to how fun this is. The developers have great interaction with the community too on the forums, twitter, twitch and reddit. Feedback is earnestly listened to and any issues raised are addressed, and have teased of great new content to come.\n\nJoin us!

(I can not stress this enough.)\n\n\n\nChronicle has been quite the adventure. Coming from the closed beta, i can sincerely confirm that this game has gotten better as the game become more refined. From the competitive mode being completely reworked to the addition of Dungeoneering, crafting recieving a rework, in-game currency, and more booster pack opportunities, the game has grown into a fantastic edition to my library.\n\n\nPros:\n• Graphical enchancements compared to the closed beta.\n• Some overpowered cards have been reworked to balance out the game. (I'm looking at you combat monolith.)\n• Excelent diversity of cards from the get go.\n• Balanced gameplay.\n• Each legend has their own unique style of play and weaknesses.\n• Casual and competitive gameplay.\n• Daily challenges to keep us playing.\n• Epic challenges that gives huge rewards.\n\nCons:\n• More legends would add more game styles into the mix. 5 is good for now but for longevity reasons, there needs to be a greater length of legends.\n• Legends are usually stuck with a niche role. More diverse legend gameplay would employ more tactics to the game.\n• A new player friendly tutorial would be a nice addition to the game.\n• Interfaces can be a bit buggy where i have to press Esc to make the interface highlightable.\n• Hardly any players. This is partcially due to a somewhat lack of an advertisement campaign.\n\n\nOverall, this game is a strong game with a lot of potential. No game is perfect in any way but, it is extremely promisisng to grow into a Hearthstone competetor. And the best part is, IT'S 100% FREE!

It's an F2P game, there has to be some source of income and the way Jagex has done it is completely fair. While some of the cards you unpack are great, they are never straight upgrades of cards you get right out of the gate, The majority of the cards you get when you just start out are completely fine and I still use quite a bit of them in my decks.

The game is play out like a two players both competing to amass a large score and the winner at the end is the one with the highest score, There is very little interaction or direct combat between the players. EDIT: At higher levels once you unlock more cards and go up against better Human players there is some nice card statergy depth.\n\nHow dose it compare with Hearthstone, MTG or Hex.\nIts is a very casual, card game that is rather lacking in depth and complexity that is seen even with Hearthstone. Currently has less content then any of the above games, though to be fair it just launched with little fan fare and the lack of content is to be expected. Dont expect spending long time crafting your decks, or carefully playing out cards. Most of the statergy is light weight. It comes down to building up a strong combination of cards and playing them out for max advantage, Each turn can be easily played out in under 1min with 5 turns for a game. Wish the animation could be speed up.\n\nFreetoPlay\nLike all card games, booster packs can be earned with in game currency. Daily quest provide a good amount of gold though less generous then Hearthstone. Hearthstone easily do a 40G quest and 3 wins will net you half a booster. This game requires quite a bit more play and time investment to do your quest which give you about 1/4 a booster pack. It also lacks the generous Tavern Brawl rewards & Ranked rewards. I would say currently due to its limited content that earning boosters is about right.\n\nPlayers willing to spend real money will have a significant advantage, as Uncommons, Rares are all clearly and significently more powerful then the weak starting cards.\n\nBasic booster only appear to drop 4x common and 1x uncommon card, have yet to get a rare or legendary from 5 booster pack\n\n7/10 Interesting concept, with potential","May 27","true","30.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You may think "wow, another Hearthstone clone??" Well, let me be the first to tell you that's where you're wrong. Chronicles has an unique playstyle, something i haven't seen in other card games.\n\nThe focus in this game is building you own character - getting higher attack stat, get armor, and all the while you're doing this, your end goal is to beat your opponent in a glorious duel at the end of five turns. You are not directly battling against your opponent until the end, the exception being the odd card here and there. This makes the game stand out from other strategic card games.\n\nThe game has great visuals that fits it's overall theme, and satisfying sound design. The game includes soundtracks from RuneScape, and they are all very nice. For people familiar with RuneScape or not, the game is just as easy to pick up for both. I would say the game is easy to learn, but hard to master.\n\nMy only pet peeve about this game is the amount of time it takes to progress and get new cards/items. I know it's supposed to be slow so people are encouraged to buy packs, but it would be reasonable to speed it up a little. I have no problems with microtransactions in this game, they are all reasonable.\n\nI would highly recommend you have a little try. I've never liked the strategic card game type games, but this game is a great exception to that. Try it even if you don't like these kinds of games, you  might be positively surprised!\n\nHave fun :)","June 4","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But this is not one of them. The play feels more like a board game than a card game to be honest. It is kind of hard to explain but you are playing as much against your own deck as you are against your opponent. I'm bad at detailed explanations of game mechanics, sorry for that, but I'm sure there are other reviews that lay it out in technical terms. I'll just promise you that it is in fact fun.\nI find this games aesthetics to be very nice but rather limited. Hopefully there will be more variety later but whats there right now looks great. My only complaint is that while the starter decks are easily obtained in a short time the boosters feel kind of grindy to get through play and the card shops booster prices are more or less on par with every other ccg and tcg all of which I think are somewhat overpriced but hey at least its just on par. If you have played other games like this you know what kind of pricing to expect.

The rules are generally obtuse and the reasoning behind card-placement and synergies usually contrived. I especially grow annoyed by cards that are awesome but only reach potential when you successfully play other cards first while hoping that the opponent doesn't draw cards that dispel your assist-cards and blah, blah, blah. Annoying times two.\n\nRunscape Legends is different. Your opponent and you resolve your own cards and the effect of that may or not may damage your opponent and may or not may help you, or indeed the cards may hurt you and help your opponent. If that sounds weird, well that's because it is. However, it makes sense in game as you learn that the cards that you should play depend heavily on the situation of the moment. Sometimes, personally taking damage to strip your opponent of their armor is the right move to take.\nI suggest to download the game and at least work through the tutorial. The tutorial does a better job of explaining the concept than I do.\n\nThe game is F2P and the model is not entirely benign. Your startingcards are weak and while the game rewards singular cards and even basic boosterpacks, they come too few and far between to stay competitive. Someone who buys the 50 boosterpacks bundle will blindfoldedly blow you away, because the truly devastating cards are in the basic boosterpacks.\n\nWhat are truly devastating cards? Those are the cards aimed at a specific hero, which play on the strenghts of your given hero. Usually, these cards can only be played when a condition is met but with some smart deckbuilding it is possible to field 20DMG+ cards in the second round and in so doing taking away more than 60% of your opponents health in the early game!\nYes, in the game's defense it is possible to grind your way to greatness but the schism between a buyer and a rube is most notably there, which makes this F2P game decidedly P2W.\n\nPositively in the game's advantage are it's colorful graphics, fun gameplay idea, nailbiting battles when you're lucky to battle another rube and the joy of gaining cards and boosterpacks without spending a dime. Since the game is overly stacked against rubes, this is where the challenge lies. A buyer will be insta-pwnage, winning because they dropped money, not because they came up through the school of hard knocks.\nIt's not their fault, it's because the developers thought that this model works best for them. You can't fault a buyer for using the options available to them, even though a rube must be lucky to have won exceptional cards to be able to stand up to a buyer. Smart deckbuilding only takes you so far, afterall.\n\nI think that this a fun game I will play for some time to come. At least until the buyers have chased all the rubes off. Jump in now before playing the F2P becomes pointless and milk some free hours of fun out of it before it is too late.","June 5","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And that's great!\n\nIt's a fun game to play and a fairly original take on a card game with each player basically fighting through their adventure until they fight at the end - it sort of reminds me of a timeline of Runescape actually with two people making player killing accounts and levelling them up until at last they can fight with them - and maybe doing a few test attacks on the other in the wilderness before running away to fight another day.\n\nSo, the gameplay is well done. I haven't played much so I can't say how well the decks customise yet.\n\nUnfortunately what Chronicle lacks is a good user interface. All of the little elements that make a card game like this that much better are missing - when you open a rare card (depicted by a sapphire, emerald, ruby or diamond) there is nothing to highlight the cards specialness - it's just "oh a a card with a stone on it". During play there is a fire effect when a card is discarded but the card disappears too fast to really see it and the fire effect looks bad. The My Collection screen is just a bad clone of hearthstones; particularly disappointing about this is that they don't have card lore which with characters like Ali Morrisane appearing as cards is a real shame. I was also disappointed that when I finally earned a card pack there was no notification; it just silently updated it for me to eventually find.\n\nAll this having been said, Chronicle launched yesterday and considering its actually very nice, original gameplay and the cool 3d opponent and board I would definitely recommend it. The problems with the game are minor and I think that they can definitely be fixed.\n\nGive it a try!\n\n---\n\nA Small Note\n\nOne tiny problem I have with the game is that I feel that the class route they've taken (mimicing hearthstone) is so unlike Runescape itself where you can develop in any and all ways. I understand that not having class only cards limits the ways that the game can develop but other limitations could have been put in place to deal with this.\n\nThink they've missed out on a lot of customisation of characters appearance that they could've charged for too in doing this.\n\nOverall I don't mind because the name itself suggests more of a lore exploration focus which they can do through using these iconic characters. But still.\n\nEdits\n\nEdited 06-06-2016 for readability of one of the paragraphs.","May 26","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazmire/recommended/205890/","hazmire","Hazmire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazmire/","165 products in account","DISCLAIMER\nI have had the pleasure of playing this game since the opening of closed beta months ago. It did't take long to realise that this was a very unique and visceral take on the generic card games being released recently. This game takes place in the Runescape universe and as such uses this rich history and lore as a base for the game's cards and characters. If you have no prior experience with Runescape don't let this scare you away, as I myself have't played Runescape in over 5 years, and I still understood everything the game had to offer. I generally held a hatred towards card games, seeing them as a boring timesink for nerds to jack off to, but this game at the very least made me a fan of the genre.\n\nThe gameplay of this game is vastly different to the offerings of other card games such as Heathstone. In Chronicle you will see yourself pitted against your opponent, racing through exciting maps towards the final fight at the end. It is this chase and race format which allows Chronicle to be so fun and engaging. You can visibly see your opponent's character on the map, moving along side yours, each of you collecting and using cards to beef up for the fight at the end. Figuring out plans and foiling your enemies is a critical part of the game, and makes every match unique and full of conniving trickery.\n\nSo far I have not personally had an issue with the amount of cards available.  As I have said, I'm not a huge fan of card games, so I really have no comparison to which I can compare Chronicle, but rest assured that the reward system does keep your deck fresh and different enough. On your arrival into the game you will have access to only a few characters. Each character has their own set of unique cards, in addition to the mass of cards that can be used globally between differing characters. To unlock new characters you simply have to defeat them, this can be done online or through the offline missions (these are just matches against a bot on differing difficulties). Decks are fully customisable and you can create as many as you like, so each match you can pick the one you feel would be best for you. What I really loved about the game was the fact each character is so different. The play and feel of each one is massive, meaning depending on who you're playing as, you will be using different tactics. At the end of each match you are rewarded with experience points. These allow you to level up your character, which in turn unlocks new cards for that character. This means that you can spend a lot of time levelling each hero up, adding to the replayability of the game.\n\nThe monetisation of this game is ok. There's really not much to say about it. You can go through the whole thing without paying a penny, and still beat people who have splashed an insane amount of cash on the game. All real money can do is buy card packs and skins for your cards and nametag. Card packs can be obtained through ingame money rewarded for playing the game, so I really don't see an issue here. Skins can also be obtained through achievements, so yet again, this is not an issue.\n\nOverall the game offers a solid experience different enough from similar titles that it stands out to be its own game. Unlike Hearthstone and its knockoffs it does not conform to the rules laid out by Blizzard, and instead has become its own exciting blend of genres that 'should' make it a very popular game.","May 26","true","0.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Slight difference is any players of Rune Scape will recognize all settings, legends, card are taken directly from another great game by Jagex.\n\nYou choose a legend from a group of 5. Each with unique card decks for spells/abilities/creatures.\n\nGames are divided in to 5 chapters. 4 cards per chapter can be played. After that if both legends remain standing, a deathmatch takes place based on attack level and health/armor.\n\nThe objective of old remains consistant. Reduce your opponent\'s health to 0 before your own life force is drained.\n\nPlenty of in-game and Steam achievements makes this a while to complete all challenges. Daily quests also add to the benefits of meeting goals to buy more card packs. Then there is the pay-to-win aspect as well where you can buy card packs or get custom skins for a cosmetic unique card-backing that your opponent will see during games.\n\nYou also earn badges and titles to make your account more custom.\n\nOverall for the price you can\'t beat it.

I haven't played Hearthstone before, so I can't really compare them, but what I do know based on my current gameplay is that Runescape Legends is sort of it's own unique game. Sure, there are similar aspects that I have seen in Hearthstone, but you don't get bored of playing this game because of it's various heroes and unlockable cards, which can be used to your benefit when confronting other players (and are all completely free, technically).\n\nThat's just scratching the surface! Sure, it can be a little rough at unlocking good cards and levelling up, at first, but when you get used to the game and how each Legend works, then you have up to three different game modes to play: Practice (Basically a combination of the Tutorial and Campaign, the AI is pretty good!), Casual/Ranked (Casual is good for practicing the stratergies in your deck, but can effect your rank and help you earn extra EXP), Dungeoneering (When your total level reaches 15, you can go in a dungeoneering game using randomly selected cards and test your true skills for some extra loot!)\n\nThe game and deck choices seem to be pretty fair on both players and all of the 5 possible Legends. Whether you treat this game like marmalade or not, it's definitely worth a few hours just to try it out! 90/100!","May 31","true","51.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

If I hadn't had the day off and poked my head into TotalBiscuit's stream, I'd have never known this game even existed. As a longtime player of Hearthstone, and of CCGs in general (Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic, heck even Marvel Overpower back in the day), Chronicle scratched an itch I honestly didn't even know I had.\n\nThe thing to realize with Chronicle is it isn't competing with competitive CCGs and is doing its own thing. Yes, it borrowed some concepts from Hearthstone but the execution is so fundamentally different as to be wildly refreshing. And while I'm sure its newness is a major factor, the game also doesn't feel "Pay to Win". The cards you are given and can unlock at the start are potent in their own right. The cards you get in packs and through crafting just feel like bonuses. As for the cards themselves - brilliant.\n\nTo give you an idea, I literally made a Thief deck which kills you with coins.\n\nIt's also astonishingly salt free. Being burned down in three Chapters is the kind of thing that would have me throwing my monitor out the window in Hearthstone, but a combination of the presentation and the heroes being optimistic even in defeat ("Losing is the way in which we learn." for example)...the game's really low stress.\n\nGive it a whirl.

You battle your own creature wich in return give you ressources or other effects wich helps you or hinder your opponent.  At the end of round 5 you get a final showdown, better get your blades sharpen.\n\nThe strategies and tricks you can make in this game are awesome. I winned ( and failed ) so many times by anticipating ( or not) the opponent moves. The one i like to use is steal opponent gold so he doesnt have enough to pay for his upcoming weapon then gets beaten by his own monster! :D You can break oppenents weapon, you can boost opponents monsters, you can bypass the armor with some cards etc... it's pretty neat and and the time i am writing this i still have to get my and on my first rare\epic card. (which are ruby and diamond cards)\n\nThe games or not very long since it is limited to the 5 rounds but somtimes i wish i could skip animations or at least wish it could be a little faster but it is a great game. for free!\n\n","June 3","true","43.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It really doesn't have anything in common with other TCGs besides the cards and the deck-building. You don't take turns laying down cards, instead you play basically 5 (or less) rounds, and you place all of the cards you want to use down all at once. You character then basically fights through these cards, gaining their dropped resources, and other buffs after defeating them.\n\nYou really have to plan out what you drop, and in which order to ensure that your character is coming out better each round. You basically want to have the most health, armour, and attack at the final battle, or at least a better combination of the three than your opponent.\n\nTry it out it's great :) I don't know what it has to do with Runescape, though. I never really got into that game over the years, however, so it's definitely possible I'm just not spotting the easter eggs.","June 3","true","8.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Chronicle is an extremely fun game that is easy to learn and incredibly hard to master. If you're just starting out, run through all the bot games and that should set you up enough to know how a lot of the cards and legends work. Then when you start the real battles you'll see your strategies ripped to shreds and have to adapt. The unique twist about this game is that instead of having to think of what your opponent will do next, you have to predict your opponent's next FOUR moves every turn and react accordingly. It's hard to explain, but adds immeasurable depth to the strategy of the game compared to most card games. You can be successful as a f2p up until the highest leagues, as I and many others have done, but I think you'll find it worth it to invest and donate a bit to this great game for some extra cards to play around with. I highly recommend this game.","June 3","true","64.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aralayle/recommended/205890/","aralayle","Aralayle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aralayle/","59 products in account","Runescape is a game I have been heavily into for ages. When I heard \'Runescape was making a card game\' though, and saw the first few images of it, my first thought was, \"Hearthstone ripoff?\"\n\nWell... I will say this: Aestically, the game has some similarities to Hearthstone. Also, the cards use a similar stat system to Heathstone. But beyond that, however, the game is completely something on it\'s own. Instead of fighting your enemy\'s monsters, you are fighting your OWN monsters, with each card you defeat having either a benifit to your characer, or a hinderance to the enemy\'s character. The goal is to basically make your character the strongest out of the two, or make your oponent lose all their HP before the end of the game.\n\nIf you are a fan of, or have played Runescape, there is tons of little nods to it, with all the cards being bosses, characters, items, and gear from both modern Runescape, and Oldschool Runescape. However, even if you have not played Runescape before, the game still is more than playable on it\'s own merit.\n\nIs it perfect? No. There is a few minor balancing issues here and there, and the game does have a lot of \'luck-based\' moments. However, matches are pretty short, lasting only 5 rounds, gameplay is fairly easy to pick up, and the different characters you can play as all have different playstyles, adding quite a bit of variety to the game. An example? An oponent picks up a weapon card, boosting their attack to 10. The enemy has 10 hp, and deals 10 damage, but gives them some extraordinary bonus for beating it.  So... they would kill the monster in one hit if things go properly, BUT, the moment before they attack the monster, you could play a card that causes their weapon to break, causing them to not be able to kill the monster in one hit... And the monster might just kill them, or leave them severely weak afterwards.\n\nPersonally, I prefer this game over most other card games, and find myself going to it when I have some free time. Since it is free to play, you might as well try it. I wouldn\'t say everyone will like it, but considering you can get a feel for the game pretty quickly, this is a \'Why not just give it a try?\' type scenerio. I have had a lot of fun with it, and while I feel the game does need more content, I know that will likely come in time.\n","June 1","true","11.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Everyone has the ability to get the same cards as higher-ranked players, and even the best decks can be beaten with some very well-laid-out thought and strategy. While most card games have you facing off against your opponents' decks, you'll be facing not just your opponent, but also yourself. Every card you play can either cost you the game later on down the road, or save your skin and carry you to victory. It's a satisfying experience, and one I'm thouroughly happy with.\n\nPros:\n-Active player-base with many knowledgable players willing to help you improve your deck and playstyle\n-Fun and exciting gameplay that requires both careful thought, planning, and luck\n-Five Legends (currently), each with their own unique decks and playstyles\n-Includes Solo (VS AI), Casual, ranked, and Dungeoneering gamemodes\n\nCons:\n-Earning money can be a bit of a grind for some builds\n-Some builds are notoriously difficult to counter (and perhaps a tad overpowered in some aspects)\n\nNit-picks:\n-Certain Dailies are set to be completed through PvP, Solo, or both. There is no distinguishing between the two (It's probably best to assume most, if not all, are obtainable through PvP only)\n-Earning copper is a bit of a grind, especially if you run into a lot of difficult-to-counter builds\n-The risk-reward for some cards are odd sometimes. That's just me, though.\n-Just like most CCG's (M:TG, Hearthstone, *insert CCG name here*), there are obviously decks that will, more often than not, completely trample players of all skill levels and playstyles, to a point where it gets (admittedly) dumb and dull as hell. My advice: Learn 'em, and counter them anyway you can.\n\nOutside of that? I love it! I'm happy to add this game to my list of favorite games. And, coming from somebody who usually loathes PvP with a passion, I believe that says something.\n\n9/10. Great game.","June 2","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The card art is decidedly similar to Hearthstone, but that is where the similarities end.  The game quite obviously lives within the Runescape universe and brings with it a huge chunk of lore and the lovable soundtrack as well. As others have said this game plays nothing like hearthstone or any other card game that I have played so far.  The gameplay  revolves around adventuring through your deck, with a final confrontation with your oponent at the end. You may clash along the way, but the final confrontation is often the deciding factor.

I reviewed back during its closed beta and its even better now. The gameplay is fast paced and the visuals are very nice for a strategy card game. If you have ever been a runescape player many of the cards, settings and heros will be familiar. One of the best things about this game is that its not overly complicated. The strategy of each hero and the game mechanics are easy to learn but challenging to master. Deck building is also pretty simple.\n\nI've seen a few reviews that say this game is pay 2 win and a hearthstone rip off. Its neither of those things and those reviews are not accurate. It doesn't matter how many card packs you buy if you don't know how or when to play your cards.\n\nAll around its a good game I'd give it a strong8/10","May 26","true","25.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

What I will say is that this a very intresting take on a TCG. Unlike most TCG's, you don't play your deck directly against your opponent. Instead, you play your cards against yourself. You defeat monsters to earn gold or attack, or use allies you power up. So deck building is based around trying to do damage to the opponent as well as power up your hero.\n\nThe game consits of up to 5 rounds (called chapters). If you get your opponent down to 0 before round 5, you win, but the 5 turn limit stops games from dragging on to long.\n\nTheres a single player mode vs the AI at 3 ranks (bronze, silver, gold) as well as online 'casual' and ranked play. Theres an additional 'dungeon' mode once you level up to rank 15, which works a lot like Heartstones Arena mode (you build a deck  by picking 2 cards from 5, up to a 30 card deck). It's quite a lot of fun.\n\nThe only real problem at the moment is the rate of unlock. You unlock cards for each hero by ranking up that hero by winning games. It costs 1000 bronze for a booster pack, although you can buy platinum to unlock faster. The price is quite steep though, so if you want a lot of cards quickly, it will cost you a lot. When you first visit the store, you get a 'special offer' of £5.99 (about $7) for 12 booster packs. This should be enough to build a custom deck good enough for casual, but you will get stomped on ranked mode unless you can build a good deck.\n\nIt runs well, even on my crappy laptop, and the art style is colourful and dynamic. Sadly there is not option to speed up the ingame animations, which can grate on occasions.\n\nIt's a fun game if your looking for a casual experiance, but if you really want to play on ranked mode, be prepared to spend a lot to get a good enough deck.","June 4","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Horrible imbalance in support/fight cards (way too many support cards, not enough cards to generate the gold for said support). Meanwhile I'm matched with enemies who have seemingly customly crafted premade decks. They have such perfect syngery, so great curve as far as gold income and spending.

So why the 'dislike'? At the time of writing this the game has a few issues that seriously detract from the fun you could have with it.\n\nPros:\n++ unique new mechanics that work really well\n+ really nice animations and effects (for the most part)\n+ business model seems fair (tough I haven't done any calculations)\n\ncons:\n-- random disconnects and server outages\n- not able to concede once the turn started forcing you to watch it to the end\n\nMostly nitpicking but annoying nonetheless:\n- the card opening animation is way too long\n- too many reward windows after a run - slows down the game\n- transition between chapters is rather slow\n- the menu could have been better crafted (some unnecessary clicks, crafting being obfuscated)\n- the avatars (big weird looking things in the background) are rather.. weird, would be nice to have an option to stop them from moving\n\nAll that said I'll keep playing the game and will change my recommendation once the disconnects are fixed.\nEDIT: some corrections EDIT2: clearing some things up","May 29","false","17.9"," 14 of 32 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","14","32","0","2"

There's some strategy in the cards you choose but ultimately the game falls to RNG like most card games do.\nI have to say it's a lot of fun so far. A very refreshing take on the card game genre.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/recommended/205890/","tmcookiez","<™[-=> Cookiez <=-]™>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/","177 products in account","Runescape Legends is a novel concept where 2 players streamline their decks and race to kill each other before/at the end of 5 chapters (rounds). You choose a class, make a deck and face your deck off against your opponent. Each round you choose up to 4 cards to play. Your choice of card ranges from equipment, allies, minions and spells. Minions have to be killed by you to earn you gold and you spend this gold on everything else. However, minions get to attack you and reduce your life points in the process, if your life points drop to zero, you've lost the game.\n\nThere are 2 currencies in the game, Copper (grind currency) and Platinum (cash currency). The best pricing I saw for Platinum was $75 for 7500 Platinum ($1 for 100 Platinum). The best pricing for booster packs was 36 Basic Boosters for 2270 Platinum (63.05 Platinum for 1 Booster Pack = $0.65 for a booster pack at best)\n\nPROS\n1. Novel Concept\nIt's a race with an interesting twist.\n\n2. Drawing 3 Cards Instead of 1\nThis +3 draw is far better than the standard +1 draw seen in Collectible Card Games (CCGs).\n\n3. Hearthstone Similarity\nYou can see similarities such as the art style, card binders, card anatomy, etc.\n\n4. Vampire Class\nPretty interesting to me. It's very thematic but hard to play. You steal HP from creatures and your opponent while giving it to yourself. However, the HP steal doesn't even trigger if you're at max HP.\n\n5. Dungeonering\nYou have to be level 15 to try it out. Seems interesting but knowing that I have to grind 15 levels is just too much.\n\n6. Auto-calculations\nI like how Chronicle calculates whether you win/lose just by you placing your 4 cards. It gives me interesting information.\n\nCONS\n1. Pay To Win\nSadly, I saw the pricing mechanism in the game. This turned me off a lot. It costs 1000 copper coins (grind currency) to get 1 booster pack. You need to grind for too long just to get 1 pack.\n\nAt a default rate of 75 Copper Coins per Solo Battle WIN, you would need 10 battles plus Copper from additional quests,  just to grind 1 pack.\n\n2. Little Interaction\nSo, do I even care about what cards my opponent plays? I just look at his stats and decide whether I want to eliminate him before the final fight. Could you possibly even know his strategy? Or are his strategies basically limited to his class?\n\n3. Grinding\nRefer to the Dungeoneering PROS.\n\n4. Rarity Creep\nIt takes 2500 Dust to craft a Diamond level rarity card. There are 4 levels of rarity in the game, Emerald, Sapphire, Ruby and Diamond. Diamond is the rarest type of card and costs 2500 Dust to craft 1. It's another extreme grinder.\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n1. Improve Player Interaction\nPlay your hand cards into your opponent's lane. E.g. Placing a high cost giant Dragon in your opponent's way to attack him.\n\n2. Environmental modifiers\nI saw the desert and the graveyard backgrounds. Perhaps, the terrain could buff creatures, modify spells or give coins. This may imbalance the game greatly since no one knows what chapter comes next. You could let the players choose the 5 locations that they play in. E.g. 2nd player choose 3 locations, 1st player choose 2 locations, then you randomise the order.\n\n3. Give Value to not playing cards\nCurrently, does reaching the end of the chapter first give you any advantage? No.\nSo, if you are unable to fully utilize the 20 slots given to you, you lose out. You might give a small reward to the player who reaches the end of the chapter first, like a race.\n\n4. Increase the number of classes\nVampire, Tank, Blacksmith, Mage, Thief. You need a lot more for variety.","May 26","false","2.3"," 52 of 114 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","52","114","2","17"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tseico/recommended/205890/","tseico","TseiCo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tseico/","95 products in account","Reading through some of the reviews for this game, I must correct a few errors most of them seem to have (not sure if they were paid to praise this game so much, or if they honestly just don't understand). All this is based on my first ~40 hours of play time, unlike the reviews who praise the game all the way into high heavens after playing it for 2 hours.\n\nAnyone who says that this game isn't 'Pay To Win' doesn't know or understand what that means, because your winrate will keep rising the more you pay and collecting (good) cards is extremely slow if you don't shove a considerable amount of money into it. This will probably be less of a problem if you grind it 6 months straight, but at start this is a serious problem.\n\nAlso there is very little strategy or tactics involved, the outcome of the game is based primarily on which player has paid more for their deck and secondarily by RNG. If both players have decks (and common sense*) of similar level, the outcome of the game is based on which player gets better hands for the particular deck they're playing against and if they get lucky aiming the "counters" against them.\n\n*If you're familiar with deck building from MtG, HS or such, piling up all the few good cards you own for your deck (which ain't that hard since you won't have much) and picking the least bad fillers after that, you will notice that almost all strategy ends there. After that all that remains is the timing when to play your cards and in which order, and that really ain't as hard as some people seem to think.\n\nAfter all that being said, I still think that the game is good. Or at least it would be if one would be able to grind cards faster (you stop getting the in-game currency after 10 or so wins). The gameplay is fun and games only last 5-10 minutes, which allows you to play as many games as you currently have time on your hands.\n\nBut I just can't recommend this because your winrate is dominated by the 2 devils called P2W and RNG.","June 3","false","68.1"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

Did you see the card that will save you in this situation? Yes? Okay, then you'll probably win. Oh, did you go second so your opponent got the extra hit in before you did, even though you were both on pretty much even playing fields going into the final fight? Well, GG.\n\nIt's a great idea, and very unique. I like that Jagex is attempting to do something different in terms of CCGs. However, I just haven't had much fun playing this game. The way to unlock cards for each deck character is to level them up, but you level them up kind of slowly, which turns the game into a grind. I don't know about you, but I don't try to play CCGs to  GRIND LEVELS.\n\nSeguing to my next point, booster packs are way too expensive. 1,000 bronze for a SINGLE booster pack that only contains FIVE cards? I don't even think in my 4 hours of constantly playing that I got that 1,000 bronze.\n\n2/10 - Great concept, don't like the execution.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAfter reading other reviews on the game, I decided to reinstall the game and give it another chance. Did not change my thoughts on the game and, in fact, actually made me dislike it more.\n\nAlmost forgot to talk about Dungeoneering, which makes the game even more luckbased. Not only do you only get to choose between two RANDOM characters when you try to go into it, but the cards you get are pretty much random. Sometimes you get cards that have little synergy with each other and causes you to lose every game because the deck just WILL NOT WORK WITH THE CARDS THEY GIVE YOU. I went into a dungeon where I chose Linza, and they did not give me any weapon durability/damage manipulation cards. However, they gave me a bunch of high levelled monsters and goblins. Needless to say, I played one game, realized that the deck had no plays, and immediately conceded, closed the game, and uninstalled.\n\nNew score:\n\n1/10 - Unique concept, very poor execution.","May 29","false","8.3"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","3","17","0","0"

I have to Disagree, the Strategic elements and cards in this game is broken by the simple fact that who goes first will allways go first......\n\nWitch in turn renders the most \"Strategic\" cards mostly useless or up for a gamble......\nLets say you got a weapon removal Card.... yeah Great if your the person starting, and your oponent end his turn with a weapon.

Now note that I'm reviewing this game just after it came out, but there is *way* too much work left to be done for it to really be playable. There's barely any content.\n\nPros:\n+ Love the idea. A novel idea for a CCG.\n+ Nice polish on the graphics and look of the game.\n\nCons:\n- The game needs a lot more characters, classes, and stuff to do. After an hour I unlocked every playable character... I'm sure much of this is coming in time, but I don't think this game had any business being released this early in the process.\n- The playable characters sound great, in theory, but they were awfully homogeneous. Yes, one class might get an extra armor card here or there, and another might have a class skill, but I could care less which class I was playing or who I was up against because they all seemed the same.\n- I also had no desire to customize a deck because the cards are also quite homogeneous and uninspired.\n- Every match felt the same. After just a few matches, I had no desire to go through the same thing over and over again.\n- I found the organization of the menus and things to be clunky and to hide much of the information I was looking for.","May 27","false","1.7"," 4 of 23 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","4","23","0","0"

Deckbuilding is shamelessly ripped from Hearthstone, down to the aesthetic, but whatever. Gameplay is completely different, allowing you to plan a series of actions over each "chapter", and dueling your enemy at the end of chapter five.\nThe problem is, PvE rewards are finite. The first three "dailies" are available for completion in PvE, and the rest you shall receive over the course of the game are PvP exclusive. The game in its current state does not tell you this. Once you earn your PvE rewards, either grind AI for levels, or play PvP.

It's refreshing to see a really different card game.\n\n-There is no option to turn off animations. After a while, I can see myself wanting the game to hurry up.\n\n-You can still get RNG screwed on drawing cards. I can imagine the same complaints in ranked play as in hearthstone.\n\n-It's free to play, try it. I don't want to spend more time in this game because of the long grind to get a decent, fun deck as a free player. It should have a large selection to start and many more cards to acquire.\n\n-Good game for super casual players and when you are trying to kill time. There should be a mobile version.\n\n-Pay to win. As a free player only, you play to gind for new cards. You can simple spend money to bypass this and just enjoy the game casually.\n\n-This game would be great if it was attached to another game, like how gwent is to witcher 3.\n\n-Wish you could see yourself (the avatar legend you use) and have purchable skins that opponents can see.","June 4","false","2.9"," 2 of 39 people (5%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","5","2","39","0","0"

Some elements should be simplified (removed), to make game less eye-catching in points where you should not do that - like all maps are good, but menus, especially collection deck is keeped in little weird shape.

When I've played Magic/HS and lost it's been frustrating; when I've played Chronicle and lost it's still brought a wry smile to my face... the whole experience is just more enjoyable, and the tipping points have felt much less like pay-to-win / RNG based (as I've felt in other CCGs) - luck is there, but feels balanced; OP cards are there, but don't feel game-breaking.\n\nI'm really looking forward to more updates, new characters, more polish, more players, more fun!","May 26","true","26.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each card is based on items and NPC's within the game for example Dragon longswords and saradomin brews however there are some cards which are simply just abilities for instance Raptor has a card which allows him to give up some of his armour to do damage to his opponent.\n\nThe players must try to indirectly kill each other through 5 stages by killing creatures with effects for example killing a scorpion will deal damage to your rival, if neither player dies by the end of stage 5 they then take turns hitting each other kind of like oldschool runescape combat all the stages are taken from the game for example Lumbridge, The grand exchange, Barrows and the mage tower.\n\nAll in all I think this is a great f2p game and whilst booster packs can be purchased for real money I see no real benefit of doing so.\n\nAlso this game beats RS3 anyday of the week.\n\nP.S im an 11/12 year Runescape vetaran with over 6000 hours invested into the game  :)","May 28","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also the gameplay so different it's hard to imagine what non-casual play would look like.\n\nFirst it's a good idea the game play is you have a hand full of monsters and buffs that you place in front of your hero to battle and recive the benifits from 4 cards at a time. This get interesting when you mess with the opponents path stealing things from them or damging them enough to kill them before you get to the 5th chapter that has the two opponenets fight using the buffs and equipment gained.\n\nWith that said this early into the game i had fun playing the standard decks but my biggest problem is i can't imagine what higher level play will be like. Games like hearthstone and dueylest have such simple mechanics looking through the cards you can craft leads to some obvious decks like aggro or combo decks. With this game there seems to be some themed cards like the pirate cards comboing with ships or obvious objectives like the theif steals and the tank armors up.

Yes, Runescape is still around and it's doing well. Well, decent. I still play it.\n\nRunescape:Chronicle is Jagex's latest game. Honestly, their last few tries have been....less than stellar (Ace of Spades is struggling on Steam), so when I heard they were making a new game, I was cautiosly optimistic.\n\nWhen it was annonced as a trading card game, alot of people instantly claimed Hearthstone rip off, which it is defenitly not, but people have been claiming Runescape is a World of Warcraft rip off for years now (Even thou Runescape came out 3 years before WoW, but ok....).\n\nSo is it good? Yes, I think so.\n\nChronicle is just as much board game as card game with constant references to Runescape in its content. Half the cards you can pretty easily understand without context (Armoured Zombie, Skeleton, Green Dragon, pretty standard fantasy stuff), others are more RS exclusive (Saradomin brew, Corporeal Beast, even Party hat). Knowing the context for them is enjoyable, although if you don't know you're not missing out on much and the names dont matter in terms of gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is solid. Original concept, each character has a distinct strategy, good variety of cards, graphics hold up well and has an overall nice feel to it. There really isn't too much to complain about for mechanics or gameplay.\n\nI have a few niggles although. Characters have a tendency to over-react (Vanescula acts like she just walked straight out of Sims 2), which is kind of distracting. There's no chat function, but there is a friends system, which is weird because if you can't talk to people in game there's no point in adding people you meet, just your friends from Steam or Runescape. The currency you pay for with real life currency is labeled as "Platinum tokens", while the free currencey you earn are "Copper coins", which make you feel something like second class scum (This complaint is really nit picky I know). Also, when Jagex first announced Chronicle they said they were aiming for a game you could play at the same time as you played Runescape, which is a bit awkward for the amount of attention Chronicle requires. However, none of these issues are deal breakers, and it's defenitley worth it for the total price of $0.00\n\nChronicle is sold as a free game that you can pay to get extra booster packs of random cards (Imagine how when you were a kid and saved up your allowance for Yu-Gi-Oh cards). Most Free to play games with micro transactions usually knee-cap you if you try get trhough without paying, but in Chronicle you can do perfectly fine without paying for anything in real life. Booster packs are given as rewards for playing the game,  or you can buy with the currency you earn in game easily enough, and really, once you've got a decent few cards spending a ton on Platinum tokens won't help much anyway.\n\nBut it's a really good enjoyable trading card game. You get decent mileage out of playing it fo free and the gameplay has clearly had good work and effort put into it. Besides a chat function, not much is missing. I'm looking forward to more characters and cards, which from the positive reviews so far it should be on the way. Hopefully it brings more attention back to Runescape too, which is still chugging along happily as an MMO when most other seem to be struggling, but you can easily play one without the other if you like.\n\nTL;DR Good game, can play for free, RS is still a thing, not a Hearthstone rip-off\n","May 31","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably not, but it is a lot of fun. The similarities it shares with Hearthstone pretty much end at them both being a card game (and there being resources like health, as well). Other than that, the format is completely different. Instead of attacking your opponent directly and clearing their minions in order to survive, you're trying to build a hero that will beat their hero. You're basically sending them on a journey; supporting them with supplies and giving them creatures to fight, so they'll grow stronger. At the end, the grand battle happens and the last man standing wins! Of course there's spells you can use to try to kill your opponent's hero earlier than that, but without those that's the basic flow of the game. So if you're interested in CCGs with strategy/RPG elements then give it a go! It's free and it'll certainly be worth 30 minutes of your time.","May 30","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's some obvious comparisons to be made but I assure you the game is completely different.\n\nHeartstone laid the foundation for a successful Freemium game, Chronicle : Runescape legends takes a few monetization cues from heartstone, some of the surrounding mechanics were clearly inspired by Heartstone but that is just because they work and aren't exploitative like most F2P Freemium games.\n\nThe gameplay is quite original, your Legend will walk through a series of 4 'checkpoints' through 5 chapters.   Each checkpoint will hold a card from your hand, if you so choose, after laying out the 'story' for the chapter you will encounter the cards you laid out..  depending on the card that was laid down you will either battle a monster and gain gold, armour, health or a weapon and trigger a specific effect.. with that gold you can then trigger effects for subsequent equipment or ally cards.. to boost attack, recover health or damage your opponent.\n\nat the end of the 5th chapter if both legends are still standing they will battle off, this battle is automated and last until either legend dies.\n\nThe game doesn't feel too grindy and is quite balanced.. you might think some legends are stronger than others and while I did believe Linza was unbalanced after playing for a few more hours I experienced some really powerful card combos from other legends..\n\nall in all, this is a great example of a Freemium card game.\n","May 30","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You don't play monsters for fight your cause, you play them so you can fight them, overpower them, and become stronger. It's absolutely refreshing.\nThe basics are simple, but to become the best you only need ONE thing, knowledge. You HAVE to know what your opponent will play and when, because when you click that PLAY button, your next 4 moves are set in stone, you can't alter them. Your main goal is screw with your opponent, remove that weapon that he wanted to use to kill a big monster, and die in the process, or just steal his gold, so he can't buy that heal.\nI can only recommend the game that is ruining my finals season at the moment...","June 3","true","87.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You soon realize the only things in common with Hearthstone is that you use cards and your collection/disenchanting works in the same manner.\n\nThe gameplay really is a breath of fresh air and quite innovative. You play as one of five legends with a deck of 30 - 35 monster (enemy) and magic (support) cards against an opponent using mainly gold (which could be alikened to mana) as a resource. You play 5 chapers where you're allowed to lay down 4 of your cards in each chapter against your opponent in a sequence on a 3D game board, at the end of the last chapter you fight your opponent in a final battle. The most refreshing aspect of all of this in my personal opinion though; You fight your own monsters that you put down, not your opponents! Each monster you fight gives you a reward or has some effect to influence the game, be it more attack damage, more armor, damage your oppenent etc. Generally the stronger the monster, the better the reward. There are deck archtypes that don't focus on monster killing though, some use the gold as a resource and rely on magic cards, others specialise in creating a good weapon for the final fight. Almost all the Legends play completely different from the other.\n\nSo with all this in mind, you find yourself playing an almost 'PVE game' trying to build your legend up in those first few chapters fighting your own cards for rewards with the intent to then move into a 'PVP game' in the later chapers (or straight from chapter 1, I'm looking at you aggro decks). All of this makes for very interesting, sometimes complex, but definity fun games.\n\nYou gain packs pretty quickly and the basic decks posted online are still competitive with decks that cost more to build.\n\nDefinitly recommend this game.","June 3","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are currently five legends, each with their own playstyles, which simply put are: Linza(attack damage/durability focused), The Raptor(armour focused), Ozan(gold focused), Ariane(spell focused) and Vanescula(hp focused).\n\nEach turn you place a maximum of 4 cards, which your character will interact with on his little "quest". And you draw 3 cards at the start of your turn. At the moment I believe that the total amount cards is 395, which is a decent amount.\n\nThe game also has some pretty good music and it's not really p2w if you do the daily quests and the epic quests later on.

But I'm seeing a pattern with Jagex, trying to suck on the teats of more successful ideas. Of course, it does make a twist on the regular card game mechanic, but just because it doesn't play like Hearthstone doesn't mean it's not a Hearthstone clone (down to the aesthetics, even). Anyway, that personal gripe out of the way.\n\nThe game is streamlined with rudimentary learning curve that allows you to jump in and understand the mechanics immediately. You could probably spend an hour or so playing and start in on ranked mode and do relatively well. But the ease of it is what turned me off in the end... I didn't mind so much sitting there and watching the animations occur, but it's rather easy to win should you just keep in mind rather simplistic and common sense strategies (card order). People may disagree, but I feel as if other games like MTG or Hearthstone have a nuance of play, but admittedly, most cardgames are 30% strategy, 70% luck. Sometimes RNG will screw you out of a sure-fire win.\n\nI wouldn't say this game is pay to win, but I was disheartened to see the amount you needed to grind in order to afford a basic booster pack (1000 copper here vs Hearthstone's 100 gold, which can easily be gathered with doing daily quests). It feels as if Jagex is sort of twisting your arm and pressuring you to spend real cash in order to speed up the process, and that doesn't sit well with me.\n\nNot for me, but it definitely has an audience. Might be a game I return to when I'm bored and have nothing better to play. It's a worth a try, and the idea they attempted to execute was novel.","June 4","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You soon realize the only things in common with Hearthstone is that you use cards and your collection/disenchanting works in the same manner.\n\nThe gameplay really is a breath of fresh air and quite innovative. You play as one of five legends with a deck of 30 - 35 monster (enemy) and magic (support) cards against an opponent using mainly gold (which could be alikened to mana) as a resource. You play 5 chapers where you're allowed to lay down 4 of your cards in each chapter against your opponent in a sequence on a 3D game board, at the end of the last chapter you fight your opponent in a final battle. The most refreshing aspect of all of this in my personal opinion though; You fight your own monsters that you put down, not your opponents! Each monster you fight gives you a reward or has some effect to influence the game, be it more attack damage, more armor, damage your oppenent etc. Generally the stronger the monster, the better the reward. There are deck archtypes that don't focus on monster killing though, some use the gold as a resource and rely on magic cards, others specialise in creating a good weapon for the final fight. Almost all the Legends play completely different from the other.\n\nSo with all this in mind, you find yourself playing an almost 'PVE game' trying to build your legend up in those first few chapters fighting your own cards for rewards with the intent to then move into a 'PVP game' in the later chapers (or straight from chapter 1, I'm looking at you aggro decks). All of this makes for very interesting, sometimes complex, but definity fun games.\n\nYou gain packs pretty quickly and the basic decks posted online are still competitive with decks that cost more to build.\n\nDefinitly recommend this game.","June 3","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know it has been said before but is is far from a Hearthstone clone, and that is refreshing.\n\nI will not lie, their may be some lack of content currently, but that is to be expected. It is still early on in it's release and Jagex has done a great job in presenting a platform they can build off of in the future. The core gameplay is something unique which really hasn't been done (at least to my knowledge) in many other TCGs.\n\nI have seen someone else call it more of a board game than a TCG, which honestly may hold to be true. That is not a knock to the card-based gameplay, as Jagex has done a good job in blending these elements together. Overall, Chronicle is a unique and enjoyable experience. It offers a fresh take on the genre and it is definitely worth a try. The future is bright for Jagex's new game, and I hope more players flock to it over-time.

It's different from Hearthstone in that you're essentially placing cards down a linear path of 4 nodes, and your hero or avatar moves 1 space per turn and battles or loots whatever is in that spot. So you decide the order you want your guy to encounter the cards. Your opponent does the same thing and things resolve based on who started first. This goes on for 5 "chapters", so you basically are dropping up to 20 cards (you can drop less). If at the end no one has died, you then take turns smacking each other automatically until a winner results.\n\nThe production value is high. The art and animations are very nice. I like the background music too. The single player modes are a fun way to learn the game with some nice unlocks. Worth a shot, esp. since it's free. You can buy card packs and vanity card backs, but you also accrue cards from beating the single player campaign as well as gaining a level with your hero.\n\nI should note that I've never played Runescape for more than literally 3 minutes when it first came out a long time ago, so having 0 familiarity with the property isn't an issue whatsoever.","June 5","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know it has been said before but is is far from a Hearthstone clone, and that is refreshing.\n\nI will not lie, their may be some lack of content currently, but that is to be expected. It is still early on in it's release and Jagex has done a great job in presenting a platform they can build off of in the future. The core gameplay is something unique which really hasn't been done (at least to my knowledge) in many other TCGs.\n\nI have seen someone else call it more of a board game than a TCG, which honestly may hold to be true. That is not a knock to the card-based gameplay, as Jagex has done a good job in blending these elements together. Overall, Chronicle is a unique and enjoyable experience. It offers a fresh take on the genre and it is definitely worth a try. The future is bright for Jagex's new game, and I hope more players flock to it over-time. Futhermore, the RuneScape branding should not intimidate anyone. No pre-required knowledge is needed of the world of Gielinor to understand ideas introduced in this game.","June 5","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I was totally wrong. This game is very different. Yeah its got glowy cards but thats about it when it comes to comparing to heartstone. You play the game against a rival in 5 different chapters. You go through the chapters playing cards and writing your history. You Try to help your self In preporation for the final fight or you can try to drag your rival down along the way. Plenty of ways to play. Also getting card packs is not too hard. I dont feel like I HAVE to put money into it. However I will.

But otherwise it is very much like Hearthstones F2P model where its fairly quick to get a couple free decks but then slows down after that when most your currency comes from doing dailies or winning against other players (since you only get gold the first time you beat the AI at its current rank). Like Hearthstone you also unlock class cards as you play with a class more to level it up.\n\nBut with that said other then the F2P model, that its a TCG/CCG, and that the main menu is a book, it is nothing like Hearthstone. Like I said its closer to Boss Monster with light Hearthstone in mechanics then it is to Hearthstone or Magic the Gathering. You play up to four cards per turn  to try to build up your hero by fighting monsters to gain attack and gold to buy weapons or spells for five turns and then if neither hero has died in the prossess you battle each other to the death, which gives the person who goes first a slight advantage at that stage but the person who goes second starts with one more card so a slight advantage while building up the hero.\n\nAll in all, I would say I rather enjoy it and it didn't feel like a waist of time trying it since it is actually fairly interesting and fells like the devs went "Hey we want to make a Boss Monster like, but with a bit of Hearthstone feel, and the Runescape characters" I never got big into Runescape, played it a bit but not much, and having no clue about Runescape didn't take away from the game at all, I am sure that if I was bigger into it I would get more of the character and enemy references, but you don't need to like Runescape lore to enjoy this game. Its definitly worth trying since its free while not being a waist of time like some of the badly made "F2P' are.","June 5","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
