Ive put way more than 112 hours into it before i had steam. The combat controls take a bit of getting used to but once you have those nailed this game will eat hours of your life.\n\nPlanet management and the tech tree are easy to understand but the tech still retains depth. After an 8 hour long game you will still have lots of tech still to discover.\nWhilst the graphics are a little dated it really doesnt matter once you are playing and you are immersed. Combat is enjoyable to watch especially when you have 3 massive dreadnoughts trying to face off against an entire enemy fleet.\n\n\n\nThis is a really solid game one of my favourite random buys ever .Its worth every penny and if you see it in a sale definatly grab it!","November 4, 2014","true","115.5"," 48 of 48 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","48","48","0","0"

My hours played does not include the older Steam version that isn't sold anymore.\n\nThis is hands down my favourite game of all time. Therefore I am actually going to take time writing this review.\n\nRidiculously deep, engaging gameplay that can allow for 250+ hours for a single large game - a game filled with desperate struggles against merciless and highly adaptable AI in long late-night/early morning sessions. A very nice physics engine allows for some interesting RTS battles with completely customised ships bristling with esoteric weaponry - from the humble red laser to giant space revolvers that shoot asteroids that glass planets.\n\nWith a quasi-randomised tech tree system and 6 different races that each play completely differently, it is easy to spend thousands of hours on this game and still not experience everything it has to offer. Multiplayer is just as good - coordinate with a friend or compete against them in 4X/RTT combined gameplay. If you thought multiplayer games of Sins of a Solar Empire or Civ were long, this game is somewhat longer, but rewards you with deep satisfaction during and after play.\n\nOverall it is similar to the Master of Orion series of games if you remember those, but also feels akin to Total War with the RTT combined with turn-based strategy, and the depth of control available during battles. Most of the time you are trying to expand, tech up and survive in a turn-based 4X type strategic map.\n\nHowever, if one of your ships encounters something hostile, you are given the option to fight manually; this is often very rewarding, you are able to visually assess the ships, including tech level and weaponry, and to also destroy them with extreme prejudice (or not if you prefer). The RTT game engine allows polygon targeting, allowing you to aim shots at precise parts of their ships - snipe off their turrets or shoot out their engines so their inertia causes them to crash into a planet. The level of detail simulated allows for incredibly fun and often unpredictable fights. This is not like Sins, where ships have simple health bars and succumb after a set number of hits; exactly what and where you hit things is of great importance - hit a tanker in the fuel tanks hard enough and be rewarded with a satisfying secondary explosion, sometimes disintegrating the ship and everything small within a large radius.\n\nVisually, it is quite dated now, something that they tried to fix in the sequel, which is somewhat buggy and sometimes broken. However, this original is very well polished, and I would highly recommend this gem of a game to anyone with half a brain and some patience.\n\nIf you do end up enjoying it as much as I have, the sequel may be worth trying, but be prepared for a general feeling of lack of completeness that is absent in this original. I wouldn't fault the devs too much for that, Paradox wanted them to release at an incomplete point and it was do-or-die for the studio. It has come a long way since release but the devs aimed a bit too high and fell short. This does not mean it is terrible, much fun is to be had, with a lot of new things to be tried - if you have the patience and an SSD to cope with the *occasional* CTD - (occasional is a relative term).\n\nTL;DR: this is a very good and underrated game, buy it (it is also cheap), play it. Don't buy the second one if you are new to the series unless you are a masochist with too much money.","July 21, 2014","true","2.9"," 48 of 48 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","48","48","0","0"

It was an old game (relatively) and I expected a few laughs and not much else. I didn't ask for this. I didn't ask for Civilization in space. I didn't ask for all the lore and all the different races and ships. I didn't ask for interesting space combat and with ship by ship construction and pretty high level strategy. They even forced multiple maps down my throat with a tech tree that is randomly generated from game to game! It was horrible. Terrible. I didn't want this.\n\nOn a more serious note. The game is fun, as usual especially with friends. Has a pretty good learning curve, interesting races with tons of lore to read. Every race plays different and is interesting in what they are good and not good at. Good mechanics and has actual space battle where you control the ships in 3d space. It can be a bit daunting at times and for some people it might get boring if things get slow. However I very much liked this game. Certainly gave me some sleepless nights staying up to play it. Graphics are solid. No real complaints, though games do tend to go very long.","January 18, 2014","true","83.7"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","39","41","0","0"

I've put 90% of my time into this game before getting it on Steam, and I still come back to it now and again. Everything about SotS is cut down to its best aspects; empire management is user friendly and simplified, but still a powerful way to gain an advantage, while combat is straight to the point and engaging. You will never spend twenty minutes meticulously planning your next turn. Instead you'll be rushing to make new designs and push production, scraping together fleets to push your advantage and stave off annihilation.\n\nIf this game had better publishing, it would rank among the classics.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Serithiene/recommended/42890/","Serithiene","Serithiene","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Serithiene/","154 products in account","I'd probably call this game a cult classic, but I don't even think the following it has would extend that far. Which is a shame, considering how epic this game is. Honestly I can say if you want a 4X space strategy game, get this, and ignore the sequel.\n\nWhy? You might ask, surely the sequel is better! Wrong, it had a terrible, terrible launch, released in a bad unfinished state, to the point where even clicking the new game button would crash it. Which isn't the developers fault, i'd like to add, they suffered the same problem that plague's most games today, the publisher forced them to push it out the door.\n\nBut back to the original topic. SotS is addictive and more importantly, fun. Six races to choose from, each with their own quirks and style of play. You can set up a galaxy with a number of options, ranging from amount of stars, to the galaxy shape, the size of the stars themselves, the distance between them... basicaly you can create any game you like and choose who you want to play and play against.\n\nIt has a randomised research tree, every game. So don't get comfortable with those awesome beam weapons, come the next game, you might be unlucky and not get that tech. There are some essential techs that every race gets, every game, like the very basic laser or mass driver tree. But each race has different probabilities of getting access to the much more advanced technologies that are in the various trees.\n\nThe empire management is... basic, you colonise planets and they develop on their own, terraforming till they are suitable for your race, and building infrastructure. Some planets are so hostile that you can't even colonise them, although there are technologies that you might get access to that can improve the hazard they impose.\n\nShip design is another interesting and fun part of the experience, as you pick different sections and weapons to put on your ships. Maybe you'd like a ship fully loaded with missles? Sure, go ahead, just be mindful that if the AI has a lot of point defense, that ship will be nearly pointless. So a lot of designing can revolve around what gets thrown against you, or what you come up against.\n\nThen, theres the random encounters... which is an option you can fiddle with in the game settings when you make the galaxy. Basically, it is what it says on the tin, a random encounter can range from a asteroid shower, which can wipe out a new colony, to getting attacked by slavers. But there are special types of encounters, which often turn out to be dangerous and can take massive fleets to stop. I'll give you an example of a grand menace I encountered in a game I played, The Peacekeeper. This dude comes into the map and travels to the center of the galaxy and makes a speech, telling you to stop all hostilities with each other and stop prodcution of war ships. Break these rules while he's on the map, and he attacks you. Sounds reasonable, right? Wrong, this guy is... holy mother of god frightening, he will literally tear your fleets to shreds, no matter what tech you have. Luckily, he doesn't discriminate and will love wailing on the AI as much as you if they step out of line.\n\nAll in all, Sword of the Stars is an impressive, and addictive game, that is starting to show it's age graphically, but the fun factor and replayability keeps me coming back to it. I deffinitely reccommend this title to any 4X fans, and especially to space strategy fans. It's an easy to pick up game, thats difficult to master.","February 14, 2014","true","42.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","2"

This game has it almost all to become a legend; too bad it has not a big name like EA for publisher.\nYou are missing some serious 4X fun if you pass this one. It has aged very well and is truly a benchmark on the genere. Don't believe me give it a shot and see for yourself.\n\nFor me THIS is the perfect 4X game along ROME:Total War.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Has a nice tutorial and manual; not a steep learning curve.\n-Can appeal to a very broad audience; vets and newcomers alike.\n-AI plays reasonably well.\n-Races have it's strength and weaknesess very well represented.\n-Incredible modding capabilities; this is a highly replay value few other games have.\n-Most mods are available even today at the developer's forum and play smoothly.\n-Easy to set up mods and get rid of them.\n-Very stable; I had zero issues regarding system stability in Windows trhough XP to 8.\n-Mods enable to work wonders regarding the playable races.\n-Most 4X games are insanely difficult or plain dumb. This game can be configured to a healthy middle ground or not... your choice.\n-Very nice fleet management.\n-Some screenshots are awesome.\n-Very fun close battles and just perfect Electronic Warfare for your ships.\n-Has a depth you won't believe until you realize you spend a lot of time tinkering with the designs and fleet roster and you realize you enjoy it as much as the battles.\n-A true and worthy successor to Master of Orion 2.\n-Easily one of the most valued games judging by the price/quality ratio.\n-Empire management is a BREEZE, efficient, elegant and comprehensive.\n-Nice diplomatic stance and neutral roaming monsters (menaces).\n-Research is absolutely perfect.\n-The most polished and fluid UI alnost perfect.\n-Massive scale? hell yeah. Even has custom maps for a quick skirmish type play.\n-A game with some seriuos lore.\n-Should you want the AI to simulate the battle it can do it nicely.\n-Nice physics engine that won't "CLIP"or clump your units. Actually you can use size as an advantage; more nimble and small vessels can outmanover largar ships for a nice and devious tactics.\n-Once you understand special weapons, intelligence and fleet layouts you are going to like it because it adds another depths to the tactical side that can cripple "stronger" empires.\n\nCONS:\n\n-No campaign.\n-AI can be seriously hampered by bad decisions, however this is rare.\n-Very hard to aim your long range weapon in some cases when a planet is between you and the enemy fleets. (your ships oblitarate a target on range though not always the ideal target).\n-Some designs are a little too restrictive, but you can manage with some creativity.\n-Somewhat dated graphics and sound effects.\n-Some weapons require manual launch and targeting but those weapons are very nice and nasty.\n\nAs you can see a nice old school game that will knock your socks off should you manage to give it a chance. The cons are only minor and certainly won't matter once you give it a shot.

But I'll be damned if it isn't fun!\n\nThe differences between the playable factions in the game are more than just the typical cosmetic or minor-boon types you find in many 4X games; every single faction has a wildly different playstyle because they all employ different forms of interstellar travel, and have different spreads of tech trees. There are a lot of random factors to the game that make every game different; planet hazard ratings, available techs, encounters, and star locations.\n\nBut it is where there is NO randomness that makes the game stand out: Combat is done entirely in real-time with actual ballistics and NO die rolls - the only randomness comes from weapon spread cones. Population growth is predictable, travel speeds behave the same every time, and weapon damage is fixed. This perfect balance of where to have randomness and where not to is what makes SotS so enjoyable; despite the random factors, skill and tactics will always have the final say in victory.\n\nToss in the amazingly detailed lore by Arinn Dembo, and you get a 4X game with a surprisingly engaging setting. The alien designs avert the usual boring "bipedal humanoid recolors" that plagues sci-fi; you've got clever reptilians, long bird-dragon-things, sentient insectoids, telekinetic cetaceans and rabid marsupials.\n\nPity about the sequel, though.

But even over time the shine of this jewel couldn't be dimmed.\n\nFirst, it has all the basic stuff that a 4X game should have, Exploration, Exploitation, Expansion and Extermination.\n\nEach of the races has their unique style of ship building and selection of Technology (which also might change slightly from playthrough to playthrough). Furthermore has each race their own needs of habitats, their own lore and most important, each has their strength and weakness. Keep those facts and specialities always in mind, because they will help you along the developement of your surpreme empire.\n\nAnd yes, that is the true objective in the game: "Build your empire, expand it to the fringes of the galaxy and destroy all other races. If you involve random encounters be warned that they are quite challenging... and sometimes at an early level of developement travelling species can finish off your empire just at the start of the game.\n\nOne thing that ticks me off was, that the game actually cheats. When you are starting with some races you will encounter (if played by AI) SolForce fleets early, sometimes build up to very impossible sizes (at least to normal construction).\n\nThe other thing is the obvious non existence of diplomatic virtues, especially if you play with AI's against Humans are the most cheating, lying and betraying race of the game... (which actually might stem from reality... heheheheh).\n\nPros:Nice Tactical Spacefights, you can give orders sit back and watch your results... while feverishly looking how your dreadnaught just breaks up by an massive attack of cruisers... Darn...The races are "unique", they are in depth described in the setup screen, with history, technology writeups and some lore.The Techtrees are randomized at start of the session, thus you might not always have the same technologies when you start an new game, some techs are race specific, take care and read the descriptions carefully.Cons:The game tends to cheat...Diplomacy is mostly fruitless during AI sessions, at least I had real troubles with the reliability of pacts...\nRecommended\nEven with the game cheating, you still can win - you just have to prepare yourself with all racial capabillities and industrial might. More anoying is the diplomacy, which is only fun during games with human foes in a multiplayer game. The options of what you can say to the other players can at first be quite stunning, but believe me - it's more easier than you might think. Also a bit on the off side, though not really something to be negative is the "one" world per System solution... There would have been other options, but this is not implemented...\n\nOverall this is a playable fun game, which will bind you for a while on your computer, exploring the possibilities, the races and of course the technologies...\n\nIf you are searching for a game that offers you lore, tactical and strategical possibilities, 4Xing and marvelous tactical Spacefights... this game would be a game for you.","November 28, 2015","true","33.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Remember to look up the controls and how to play. I didn't know how to aim my ship's weapons for example, and it cost me quite a few battles. Left Click to aim, middle mouse to focus cam, and right click to move them (tactical).\n\nPlaying with friends against the A.I. is so fun and an entire campaign can last days depending on when you can play. The best part is that the game isn't tedious, and yet has a lot of depth and strategy. Figuring out what your tech tree favors, deciding what planets to colonize, trade, and tactics play a huge role.

This is the most fun I've had with a 4x since Alpha Centauri. They implemented a lot of elegant solutions to reduce tedium and streamline management without losing depth or complexity. The UI is not intuitive largely because they kept it from being cluttered, as such the tutorials are highly recommended.\n\nShip design was done very well. It is very satisfying to come up against an overwhelming opposition, make a few minor adjustments to a design and alter its tactics and come back and win not because you had bigger boots but because you used an effective strategy. There is a lot of depth to design, and variety is rewarded.\n\nStrategy in combat is very enjoyable as you are given plenty of useful tools. You can make a 2 tier setup with heavily fortified ships engaging close range and long range support keeping distance without having to constantly switch between the various groups to give orders. That might sound oversimplified, but it doesn't play itself. It simply gives tools that streamline basic tactics and the end result is a smarter and more fluid battle. Also, combat is simulated in engine, there are no behind the curtains dice rolls to verify hit and miss. If missiles get shot down, it's because anti-missile turrets hit their target. Furthermore, it is possible to target specific points on the enemy if you want to disable something specific, like getting behind the enemy and taking out their forward shields, or their engines. Combat is as tedious or simple as you choose to make it, and the end result is a rewarding experience.\n\nDiplomacy is available, but rather than assume you want to be friendly with the neighbors, the default is war, with alliances and NAP's being something you have to work for if that’s what your into. It's there if you enjoy the challenge of diplomacy, but its assumed you want to blow things up. With that said, any time you encounter a new player or AI for the first time your ships are set to hold fire, so the game respects the possibility of peace, but you must research their language and diplomatic options for them to be available.\n\nPeople say this is underrated, and I have to agree. I'm more than a little annoyed that I didn't find this gem until now.","February 3, 2015","true","4.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

The game has several unique factions with distinctly different playstyles and ships. This game can be played with complete naivity to the deep internal complexities and still be an enjoyable blast but if you dive headfirst into the amazing and complex inner workings of the game it turns into something completely different with almost complete control over every fascit of your empire. Coupled with the strong gameplay comes a unique randomness involved with strange alien incounters and battles againts grand menaces who threaten the entire universe. The randomness also extends into research forcing you to adapt and change your strategy around which researches are granted to you and which ones arnt. It is completely up to you whether you want to be the distant underinvolved monarch or the controlling tyrant who wields his power with an absolute hand. Its completely up to you how build and create your galactic empire. Oh and did I mention COMPLETE REPLAYABILITY with enough RNG integrated into the game to make each and every playthrough feel completely different and lets you expierience a whole new kind of game every time you play it.

Even though that game came out in the 90s, it's still the best by virtue of doing everything better than everyone else. Moo2 has sat lonely on its throne of 'Best Space 4X', and only rarely have there ever been pretenders. This game is one of them.\n\nThis game deviates from a lot of Space 4Xs on how radically different each race plays. While most 4X games differentiate species by simple bonuses and ship designs, SotS goes further by changing the very way civilizations travel the stars. Humans can go fast, but their routes are limited. Tarka can go anywhere, but are slow. Hiver have to get to starts via STL, but can construct instal-travel warp gates once they're there.\n\nIt also changes wars from outright conflicts of extermination by introducing the concept of alien civilians. No longer is it one species standing on the top of the hill at the end, but possibly all the ones you've integrated into your empire either by conquest or peaceful immigration. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't have that muche effect on the strategic level, but it's a nice detail I've never really seen in other games.\n\nThere's also the matter of the combat system, which is very solid. Every species ship plays different, and there's even space monsters you get to shoot at to make things interesting.\n\nThis game also has some of the most detailed lore I think I've seen in any 4X *ever*. Arinn Dembo, who worked on the story of Homeworld, has probably written a novel's worth of backstory to each species, and still posts stuff about it from time to time. It's the extra mile that makes this game special, despite its flaws.\n\nNow, the bad: this game is ugly. Horrendously ugly. The interface is one of the worst you'll ever see, and a lot of the "art" seriously looks like something from a teenager's deviantart account. The AI is notoriously prone to temper tantrums, and will declare war on you for very minor things while they're literally destroying your outer colonies. Even though the battlescape is good, ships do have a tendency to ignore your orders or do them completely wrong, The Autoresolve feature for the battlescape is hilariously broken, and you can win battles with it you'd otherwise lose your entire fleet to.\n\nLike I said, beautiful mess. It's a game you have to give several chances, but I think it deserves them.","November 30, 2015","true","188.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They proceeded to destroy most of my fleet and my colonies. They murdered my people and made my cities into nests for their queens. I would lose every battle with only takng out a few of their ships. I sent a colony ship into deepspace in hopes that they would find a planet while we were eradicated. BUT just as i had given up hope, My research team finished reseraching Dreadnuaght class ships. I, in a last ditch effort built one and sent it to my former colony to clense the bug scum festering there. The battle was long but in the end i was able to destroy their local fleet, their hive and one of the queens. The Dreadnaught and all crew were lost however. This was my first victory against the vermin. I began mass producing dreadnuaghts and sending them to purge the bug filth. One by one i reconquered my colonies, which major cassualties on my side. and eventually the last hive was destroyed. There was still some kind of super queen still out there however, I onky ran into her once and after the last hive was destroyed i had not seen her so i assumed she was gone for good.\n\nI Began rebuilding my empire and put this whole thing behind me. Couple hours later i check up on my Colony ship, yes the same one, and noticed that they found a nice planet to settle. I settled a colony and a few hours later my ally requested help with defending a planet. i send some ships and what do i find? a Giant Bug Super Queen wrecking my allie's fleet.

Combat is determine through a cinematic trailer of ships facing off via broadside battles and selecting a "Buff Card" for three different phases of combat.  Not exactly my cup of tea but still a fun game.\nStarDrive 2:  Best way to put this, 2d Version of a wannabe SoTS game.  No multiplayer and tends to bog up late game on a large map.  Tech tree is horrid in comparison.\nGalactic Civ 3:  Played the beta for a little while, when I found out that you can control ships in combat I ditched the game.\nSword of the Stars 2:  Stay away from this game...There was a fallout between the producer and developer.  In honest opinion, Ironclad as someone previously stated should have made the game.\nSins of a Solar Empire:  Massive like SoTS but pure RTS with real time combat.  ZERO ship customization.\n\nSo if you like a game where you have hundreds of stars to conquer\nIf you like a game where theres an expansive and random tech tree for each game,\nIF you like a game where you have nearly 100% control over the customization of ships weapon placements and designs (except for hulls, they are prefab), this is the game.\n\nSoTS to me remains the BEST 4X game.  Never played MOO or MOO2 so I cant compare.","June 2, 2015","true","117.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And I have indeed gotten play value out of it, but it remains very weak in many standard 4X space genre key points!\nIn fact this game is 90% it's space battle scenes, with a less well crafted 4x (or even 3x) tacked half heartedly onto the space battle routines - to give the battles some kind of meaning!\n\n- The game "galaxy" is not realistic..... it's just a bunch of different coloured stars, all purely cosmetic, none of these colours means anything, that just turn into a single planet when you explore them. Not since Master of Orion 1 in 1992 (and this was MOO1's ONLY bad trait) have I seen this one planet per star rubbish! They're not even proper star systems at all, actually. Not since "Elite" on the C64 and BBC Micro in 1984 have I seen such BORING systems. And yes "Grilleds" I full well know what *you* think about this - and maybe he was half right, as I've played the game more, I've not noticed the astronimical BS that makes up this game's universe! But I'd still like to see realistic stars, multi-star and multi-planet systems, with moons, asteroid belts etc!\n- Apart from a basic "numerical climate stat", a basic "single resource count" and a "size of 1 to 10" these boring planets are all the same functionally as well as cosmetically! There are no special features with any of them, except some have asteroids around them..... so "eXploration" is a bit moot then..... this is a 3X space game, not a 4X! Still this does just manage to be enough for the game to be playable.\n+ Though there are only six races and two of those were only added with DLCs bundled in with this "Complete Package" edition! They're good races, and the game does take on a full different flavour with each having it's own ship sets, and music theme sets etc.....\n- The descriptions for these races is an irritatingly smug, clever-d1ck sounding, load of over verbose Darwinian twaddle! The developers put more effort in these bollshit texts than they did the game itself! When they weren't whacking off to one of Dawkin's bogroll books that is! Little wonder the game is such a dog's breakfast in some areas! Yes, I'm NOT an atheist. I'm not a Darwinist neither. Live with it. Not that this harms the game though!\n\nAnother major minus with SotS is the cheating AI. I don't care a jot what the fanbois and the developers say, the AI CHEATS PROFANELY. Simple as.\nThe only game I have won so far is the tutorial. All other games, even on so called EASY have resulted in a 10 : 1 outclassed defeat. The last game I wasted over 24 hours of my life on I thought I was sure to win. I unlocked Dreadnoughts by turn 50..... but by turn 250 - even though NONE of the AI had Dreadnoughts yet - I was still unable to so much as dent the enemy. Even the tiniest planet had over 200 cruisers + the full suite of 30 - 40 various defense orbitals, sure I had DNs but I simply could not build enough. I had only 8 colonies and already my economy was collapsing under the weight of the fleet I had. No way can the AI have 200+ ships at all of it colonies unless it is TOTALLY INGORNING the same "economy rules" you are subject to! And the AI sides all had about 30 colonies each against my 8. I just simply had to throw in the towel. Next time I'm using cheat codes and/or Cheat Engine. I think the only way you will ever win a game of SotS is to totally disable the economy and fleet maintenance costs 100% - which will mean you can devote everything to research.\n\nBRILLIANT! Not ONE cheat code exists and Cheat Engine won't crack it!\n\nThe AI must ignore planet environments as well..... I'm sure it is allowed to colonise even the most impossible of hostile worlds. In this last game again, I explored about 60 systems in the first 100 turns - and found only 8 even half habitable worlds..... the AIs had found 30 each..... now how they do that huh?\n\nI have also discovered it crashes and freezes regularly when commencing battles with large numbers of ships! (Well it did in one game anyway, constantly!)\n\nGoing off the fact that only 2 / 11 people have posrepped this review also shows what an elitist bunch of smug fanbois the majority of the SotS community is. Maybe I'll get more posreps now I've changed this review to a more positive one. Despite my initial complaints, my heart saw something in this game my head did not. I kept playing, and it's kept growing on me. I've even changed the main "recommend this game" to a thumbs up yes! I've even now managed to win two games - though with the help of a strong ally and only in small galaxies and on the easiest settings possible. I still believe the AI cheats, profanely.\n\nOh ho! That's interesting! Changing this review from "not recommended" to "recommended" reset the neg and pos reps! Now there's a tool to use against all the idiots who gang up on you and negrep you silly!","March 15","true","523.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","3"

It doesn't help that virtually nothing in the research tree is quantified so you'll just be shooting blind in the dark with the "I guess this might be helpful" approach.  Ship design is something I love, but once again a very detailed system is rather ruined by unquantified data or no data altogether when it comes to weapon damages, power outputs etc.  The combat was a letdown with clunky controls that don't even have toolbar tip rollover as an option on the rather sparse control options.  There is no option to create a custom civ here.

Still, I have to give it a negative review. There are two main problems that absolutely drive me nuts, the first being that the game AI just crushes you with its computational power. Even on smaller maps, there is just way too much to keep track of, and towards the middle and end of the game it just becomes incredibly tedious. The AI consistently manages to outpace on all stats, which I think might be in part due to the fact that there are alot of really worthless techs in the game. It has a really annoying learning curve because of that, which is my second main complaint. Techs that might seem useful end up being totally worthless, and it takes awhile to figure out which are crucial, and which are just wasting time. Also, what level of hazard do you colonize, and when? (With what level of technology) This is also a process of trial and error, since there is no way to calculate exactly when a colony will become profitable based on X number of colonizers times Y technology divided by Z hazard. The balance between races is also pretty off, and you will most likely want to stick to only 3 races out of the 6 or so available.  This game would probably be alot more fun on multiplayer and in any case, is definitely not for the casual gamer.","February 8, 2014","false","5.3"," 19 of 50 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","19","50","2","0"

All the Gal Civs and other releases are reskins mostly and are updated visually, but not essentially.\n\nGodawful. I feel like this game is some weird forgotten creepy photograph of a person, found in an old shed in the middle of a forest, and as you look closer into it you begin to see it's not really a person at all...\n\nIt feels like you're playing a 4x game, but something is off, and it drives you into the uncanny valley of "...This isn't really a 4x strategy is it? So what exactly am I playing then?". The features are "there" but they are only implemented to mimic the actual real features you'd find in other proper 4x games. Old timey ones were all different and good in their own way, but this seems to try mimic them all without being able to excel in any department, and let's be honest - all of the elements are pretty awful.\n\nThe author of the setting cannot decide if she wants a hard sci-fi, or a soft one, or maybe a starwarsesque space-opera, or an "uplifting story set against the backdrop of space". Her work is plagued with blatant plagiarism and does not provide sufficient immersion into the story - a Frankenstein of all things scientific an fictitious, but a discerning reader could easily see the stitches. Not necessarily like GamesWorkshop and its 40k, but quite close and much less presentable. As the setting is the main selling point for me - I cannot relate to this game at all. Sorry, Aryn.\n\nAnd of course, it's the complexity of the game that is its main drawback.

I was really disoriented by it and in my first few games spent as much time just reorientating the map as I did actually playing the game. Beyond that it was still very frustrating. Techs offer vague bonuses ("Stronger Hulls" - How much stronger?) the combat system is fairly obtuse (There are 4 options for your combat stance when you enter battle but two of them seem to garauntee being blown up without firing a shot if your opponent feels differently).\n\nI'd honestly love to play the game if it would just tell me accurate information. With one race you can tell a ship to move beyond its actual range but the game will still give you an ETA. "5 Turns". Well, no, it would be 5 turns if the ship actually made it there, really it's 3 turns of movement and infinite waiting until you send a tanker out to refuel.

The customization options on your ships, in terms of weapons and missions, are excellent. The fact that you can take one mission module and outfit it for different roles makes it very easy to set up your fleets however you want with whatever you have available to you.\n\nGameplay is fairly quick, and you can set different options up for how long real time combat can take at max as well as your strategic turns time limit if you're playing a live game. Customization options are excellent when it comes to setting up games and maps. You can set up how many stars are in the game, how many players, what shape your map will take, etc. While star names will repeat from game to game, you won't ever really run into the exact same map twice.\n\nThe different races are all unique, with differing rates for certain techs, and different strengths and weaknesses between their ships and trade/money generation.\n\nFinally, combat is by and large the best part of the game. Although you're somewhat limited by how your ships move during tactical battles (no intentional vertical movement, although ships will move up and down to avoid obstacles and other ships), the physics simulation is excellent, with a ship moving forward requiring time to stop proportionate to it's speed, and even having your ships knocked around and sometimes into planets by heavy hitting weapons. Plus, it's awesome to see a bunch of ships blast each other with volleys of missiles and plasma weapons.\n\nOverall, this game is the ♥♥♥♥, and  should be played by everyone at least once.","January 11, 2014","true","60.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the expansion sets there are a total of 6 playable races, and each has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, different visual and audio themes, along with unique ships and engines which totally alter how you play the game.  The lore behind each of the races is very impressive as well, I only wish we saw it more directly in game rather than just as text.  But the game is good, fun, long, slow.

(For example I once had a fleet of cloakable cruisers carrying bio weapons that I could sneak past enemy defense fleats and bomb their home planets out from under them without losing a single ship) If you choose to play this game watch an online tutorial of something to get the general hang of it, one important thing to focus on early IMO is a command ship (gives you a much greater control over the battle and which ships from a fleet will fight in it) also try and upgrade a basic weapon and a special weapon (Say, lasers, and torpedos) I generally go for torpedoes just because I love the flashy explosions : P","June 28, 2014","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Any given game you stand a solid chance of triggering ancient space traps, fending off enslaving space marsupials or watching in horror as your robot workers become sentient and begins a crusade across the galaxy.  And those are some of the more likely scenarios.  There are stranger, and more difficult things that might occur over the course of a game that can change the usual free-for-all to a set of uneasy alliances engaged in a bitter struggle to survive a common, devastating threat.\n\nThe game itself plays out as a turn-based strategy game on a 3D starmap.  Battles are either autoresolved or played as real-time skirmishes, with decisions and research made on the turn-based map impacting the capabilities of the ships in the battle.  Ship design is a major gameplay element, and works quite well for the most part.  Research into command and control technologies will add more elements to the real-time battles like sensor coverage, reinforcement ordering and larger fleets.\n\nThe different species in Sword of the Stars have major differences in gameplay, which leads to oft-amusing and unique scenarios in every game.  Every side has its own method of movement, desired planet type and research priorities, giving what could have been a straightforward conquer-or-be-conquered game a bit more depth and intrigue.  There is surprisingly fleshed-out lore, and the actual faction species are creative and varied.  There are hyper-destructive space possums, Latin-speaking, fast expanding space humans, telekinetic space whales with a penchant for genocidal bioweapons and intensely slow, tough, monarchic space insects among the playable factions.\n\nThere are plenty of issues:  the interface is complex and unintuitive, the amount of randomness to the game can be frustrating, and the voice acting straddles the line between charmingly bad and ear-grating.  Most of the unit portraits and loading screen art is amateurish at best, and the base game isn't the prettiest thing to come out.  There is a solid core of inventive ideas and decent gameplay though, and the game lends itself well to replayability.  The multiplayer worked quite well, but the internet multiplayer was done through Gamespy, so games have to be set up through a virtual LAN like Hamatchi right now.  It's worth playing if you enjoy stuff like galactic civlizations and distant worlds.\n","June 27, 2014","true","130.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The different races all have unique play styles, with different methods of FTL travel rather than just having one race be better at farming. The economics are pretty simple by the standards of the genre, but they aren't the focus of the game. The combat is a lot of fun. Shots are actually modeled, rather than being determined by a to-hit roll, and battles are determined as much by good strategic movement and arcs of fire as by technology.\n\nSword of the Stars tried a lot of new things, and they really worked.
