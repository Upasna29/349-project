Battle of the Bulge is a simplistic turn-based wargame with only 3 different unit types (infantry, armored cav and tanks), only a few scenarios but an AI that actually proves to be very challenging no matter what general (different scripting and difficulty) you choose to fight against. Let's just say that it is literally waiting for you to make mistakes and will not hesitate to capitalize upon it. The game itself is easy to pick up (I understood most of the concepts after playing the first scenario a couple of times) and the fast paced nature of the game means that you won't have to play each mission for too long, so the gameplay is rather addicting in that regard. My favorite part of the game is probably the amount of meticulous research and data that has been provided in the "Reports" that you get at the end of every day and also the "History" menu which is pretty much just a nice bit of background for those interested in the battle itself.\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMhINrufQtE\nMy one complaint with the game is the rather limited number of scenarios and unit types. Then again, this wasn't meant to be a difficult or long drawn out wargame which is actually one of it's charms. If there is a sequel, I'd definitely like to see this format again. All in all, for only 9.99, this will prove to be a valuable purchase.","September 17, 2015","true","6.2"," 78 of 89 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","78","89","9","1"

The German A.I. started off good, but once I blocked every possible route of advance, the A.I. didn't know what to do anymore. It started moving around units without purpose, moving them to one place and then moving them back again. At first it seemed like some sort of a plan to prepare a breakthrough, but nothing like that happened. I waited for an attack to happen, passing every turn to him, but the A.I. wouldn't engage, wouldn't attack anymore, and kept shifting units up and down the line without any apparent plan or idea what to do. After minutes of fooling around, the game finally crashed, saving the A.I. a humiliating defeat.\n\n- It also looks like they made the Bastogne sector A.I. especially resilient against german attacks; no matter how overwhelming the odds, somehow the attacking Germans in the Bastogne sector always seem to miss their targets, making the defenders turn out extremely tough.  "American heroism" is probably the best explanation for this phenomenon.\n\nthere are some positive points, like nice graphics, easy-to-understand game mechanics, and effective menus, but still not enough to really recommend this game","September 20, 2015","false","15.0"," 66 of 89 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","66","89","4","16"

Removing the luck factor, the player must move armies across the map and capture territories in order to fulfill certain objectives. You can't produce your own units, but every other turn or so each side might get reinforcements depending on the scenario. Thus, the game offers limited resources for each "mission", but this forces the player to come up with creative and meaningful decisions in order to succeed, as opposed to massing an immense number of units and crushing the AI through sheer force of numbers.\n\nThis is a very good game for a company's first title. While the prime concepts of gameplay are rather easy to understand, there is enough depth to the game that it never feels stale: Battle of the Bulge falls into the easy to learn - difficult to master category. Thankfully, the AI is challenging enough, so the player must put in the effort and think for himself. It is definitely worth its price and can prove to be a gripping title if you are one to enjoy slow, turn-based strategical thinking.\n\nI whole-heartedly recommend this game.","October 7, 2015","true","3.5"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","16","25","0","0"

In the case of this game, nobody is pointing out that this game is NOT a realistic simulation of a World War II battle.   It is not even close to a realistic simulation.     I recommend this game only because it is a good strategy game, the same as I would recommend chess to someone, but this is not a World War II battle simulation.   I played other war games on my main steam account that are accurate and realistic when it comes to World War II battles, but this game is not even close.\n\nFor one thing, you can only move units from ONE region a turn which is totally unrealistic.     It is impossible to do multiple battles across multiple regions, which is what would occur in real life.  They had radio communication in 1945 and they could communicate and plan simultaneous attacks on multiple fronts in those days.   Or even the individual commanders of each unit may of decided by chance, to attack at the same time as someone else.      Not being able to have simultaneous battles originating from multiple regions is totally unrealistic in this game and makes this game as far from a realistic World War II battle simulation as you can get.\n\nA different reviewer pointed out that it makes the game more strategic and makes you think more by having that feature (only being able to move units from one region per turn) and I do agree with him.    But that reviewer neglected to point out how unrealistic it makes the game, and some buyers may be looking for a realistic simulation of a World War II battle.   Personally I prefer this feature and like the fact it makes you think a lot about what units you want to move first in a day.    Just to avoid confusion, you get enough turns in a day, that you are able to move all your units on the map.   The thing this game does, is make you decide which units to move first.   You can't move or attack from multiple regions at the same time.     As I said, I recommend this game as a good strategy game.   I just don't recommend it as a realistic simulation.\n\nAnother way this game is not realistic is it goes to unrealistic extremes on unit supply.  In real life, units would receive supplies that would last a few days or even a week.     They didn't receive supplies only for 1 day at a time, as far as I know.     If a unit got stuck behind enemy lines, it could survive and fight back for atleast a week.   It might have to ration its food and it might have to search the countryside for food, but it could survive and fight back for atleast a week.    In this game, if a unit is cut off from supply for little over a day, it then becomes an "isolated unit" and it is UNABLE to fight back.    The unit just sits there when attacked and doesn't defend itself.    That is a unit that was cut off from supply for just a little over a day.    Makes absolutely no sense at all, is not historically accurate, and is not realistic.    But again, it makes you think more having to worry about units becoming isolated and cut off from supply in the game, so while it makes the game totally unrealistic, it also makes it a better strategy game.  I actually resigned after the first 3 days out of 8 days in a scenario against the computer AI in a game, where I selected Bradley as an opponent and played the endgame scenario, because the computer kept cutting off the supply lines for my units.   My units weren't able to move and I was screwed, so I didn't see any point to continue, though I probably could of won the game due to the ridiculously little victory points needed to win.   I usually set personally goals for myself in the game when playing against the computer to make things more interesting.   But back on topic:  This is a very fun game to play and is very challenging because of having to worry about keeping all your units in supply and not even losing supply for a single day.   I think this is what the developers were aiming for, more strategy at the cost of realism.\n\nI can go on about several other ways this game is unrealistic, but one of the big ones is the calendar.    You can look at the calendar and see a list of the exact dates when the enemy will receive reinforcements and the exact reinforcements they are getting is listed.     How unrealistic can you get.    This information should not be given to the player, or be available to the player.      You should have no clue when and what reinforcements the enemy is getting, as you would in real life.     But I think this game does it that way, to again make it more strategy oriented while it makes it totally unrealistic.      You can plan ahead your moves and base them around what troops the enemy will be getting.     There is also no fog of war, so you see all the reinforcements on the map.   But this game is like chess, it is a good strategy board game, where you get to see all the pieces of your opponent at all times.   So you can plan your moves around that, and I actually like the fact it does it.\n\nSo the question is do you care that the game is unrealistic, or do you care more that it is a good strategy game that is tough and requires a lot of thinking and planning?     I recommend this game as a good strategy game, and other reviewers do the same.     I am only pointing out, what all the other reviewers neglected to do, that the game is unrealistic, so those buyers who don't want a game like that will know in advance.     I personally like this game a lot, I enjoy playing against the challenging computer AI, and once I get tired of playing against the computer AI then I will seek multiplayer opponents.    This is a very nice strategy boardgame.   It doesn't bother me that it is unrealistic, because it is a whole lot of fun and makes you think a lot when playing about your moves.   As I hinted at in another paragraph, I set personal goals for myself when playing against the computer to make it more challenging.   For example, if playing as the axis player, I may set a goal of getting a certain amount of victory points by a certain day and also having a certain number of units exit the map by that day.    By setting difficult goals for myself, and considering myself as losing if I don't meet the goals, I made the game a lot more challenging and intersting to play.    So a suggestion: Anyone who buys the game can do the same thing.   Just use your imagination for personal goals to set, and don't cheat, if you can't achieve your personal goals then you lost so you have to resign.     I thought of over a dozen possible personal goals to set in the game, to make the game more challenging.   Anything you can imagine, can be a personal goal.   Achieving a certain number of victory points by a certain day in a scenario, Acceptable losts  (losing only a certain number of armor units and certain number of infantry units by the end of a scenario),  Defeating a certain number of enemy units (certain number of armor units and a certain number of infantry units),   Exiting the map with a certain number of units when playing as the axis player, Defeating a certain number of British units  (those units are brown in color and stay to the west of the river until you are adjacent then they can move east), Preventing the axis player from gaining control of any space that gives victory points  even for a single turn  (if the axis player gains control for a single turn, then you have to resign because you lost), and so on.   There are over a dozen and even more then that, possible personal goals you can set to make the game more challenging when playing against the computer.\n\nI had one other suggestion.   Most new players will play the tutorial, and that is useful but the tutorial leaves a lot of details out.    So my suggestion is to take the time to read the manual and I'm not talking about the in-game manual.   Go to the store page for the manual and read that one.","May 13","true","11.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Choosing the Axis side in 'Bitter End' should be brutally hard, but by singlemindedly advancing on Verviers, Liege and Namur you can permanently cripple the Allies through squatting their reinforcement zones (don't forget to send one of your weaker mechanised divs to capture Arlon and shut down their southern reinforcements as well). Playing the Allies, the AI German strike is poorly focussed and easily stymied - and they will respond to your buildup of force on their flanks in no way at all.\n- The map's tiny.\n- Axis, 'Bitter End': from 24th December on the game processes every other day as 'Two consecutive passes, day over' without actually giving you a chance to move.\n- The premise of the game (area activation of units) promotes force concentration over dispersal to far too great a degree.\n- Too much is left to the clock - time advances with little relation to what's happening on the map.\n- Various graphical and interface bugs (sudden shaking, erroneous popups) should really have been ironed out before release.","September 20, 2015","false","3.9"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","13","23","2","0"

So I was pleasantly surprised to find that John Butterfield has created an absolute gem of a game that really combines the best of both worlds.\n\nBattle of the Bulge plays exactly like a tabletop game, only better. It has the simplicity of form that is such an important part of the appeal of tabletop wargames, and which is also the key to their success as historical simulations. Battle of the Bulge takes a solid wargame design in this tradition, and adds just enough digital bells and whistles. The random number of turns in each game day is a particularly neat aspect of the design.\n\nI do have a few criticisms.\n\nThe game shows its origins as an iOS port. There are no tooltips or hotkeys, which would really speed up play. There are also some graphics issues. Although the game looks great in general, it can be tricky to make sense of the terrain without zooming all the way in. Bridges and towns in particular are easy to miss. It should be possible to select groups of units; moving three units down a road together shouldn't take seven clicks.\n\nInformation isn't always presented in the most helpful fashion. There's no reason for battle pop-ups not to be expanded by default, and without tooltips there's no easy way to check which combat modifiers will apply except for moving units into a space and then undoing. I had to play a few games before I really understood how reinforcements arrive. Some kind of reminder on the main screen of where reinforcements are inbound and what special rules are in effect would be a huge improvement.\n\nThe AI is fine, but could use refinement. I didn't notice big differences between the commanders, and after a few games you'll be stomping them flat anyways. The AI does have an annoying tendency to abandon important spaces; I've frequently seen it vacate Liege to disastrous effect. Multiplayer is where a game like this really shines anyways.\n\nThere's also a whole kampfgruppe of obnoxious bugs on the loose, but I'm trusting that they'll be destroyed by superior developer airpower once the weather clears.\n\nThis is a fabulous game and I can't wait for the next installment in the series, one of which is designed by my very favorite game designer Ted Racier. (Hey, Ted! How about a digital version of Case Yellow, 1940?) I hope that other wargame designers will take notice of Battle of the Bulge and try something similar. This really could be the future of wargaming.","September 27, 2015","true","91.3"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","1"

Every turn you activate all of your units in one region and move them. If you move them into a space with enemy units there is a battle. Easy, right? Well, to make things more interesting, the game is also divided into days. Every day consists of many turns, and no units can be moved twice in one day. This isn't even getting into the supply lines, crossing river, artillery, air support, on and on and on.\n\nThe game holds a lot of complexities, but is very easy to play. The tutorial teaches you everything you need to know in about half an hour and points you to where you can learn more specifics. It can be played by anyone, but takes work to master.\n\nThe AI is very good at the game. Of the three games I played I only won one game (the one from the video). hat being said, I loved them all. Every descision matters and the AI is good at keeping you on your toes.\n\nOverall, I loved this game. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys military strategy. This one will keep you thinking. Oh, and it has multiplayer as well if you are a military genius and think the AI is too easy.","September 18, 2015","true","5.9"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","21","41","3","1"

In general it seems to force you to commit your move on each individual section and then advances the time clock.  Normally both in turn based games and to reflect real life over a set period of time all your units should be able to move at the same time and then the clock should advance.  However when playing the AI the same rule doesn’t seem to apply to the AI units as they seem to move simultaneously  which makes the game impossible to win!\n\nI found this game very frustrating and annoying and therefore would not recommend it!","September 20, 2015","false","2.9"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","12","24","2","1"

After the tutorial was over, I was thinkiing "this seems easy".   Ha !   The simple game mechanics and seemingly abstracted unit types are deceiving,  The game requires some thinking, planning and prioritizing.   I have played twice so far, and lost twice as the Axis.   The area based activation and movement system with its imposed limit of one area only per turn makes the decision making a tense affair.\n\nI have read the odd criticism of the turn system and limited unit types, but simply do not agree with those few critics.   As a wargamer  (since about 1974) who has played virtually everything worth playing, I like this game very much, and give it a hearty two thumbs up.","September 22, 2015","true","1.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

It's pretty easy to learn as the tutorial is clear and the mechanics are fairly straightforward and easy. However these simple mechanics are extremely deceiving (found myself in a pickle in the first game after the tutorial, thinking that it will be very easy).  I'm on my second campaign and I can say that the AI is nicely done and challenging.\n\nThe feature that I absolutely love in this game is the mechanic that makes you move units from only one area per turn(if you want to). It means that you have to think carefully about all your options and try to get the best possible outcome. The historical aspect of the game is also nice.\n\nOnly complaint I have so far is the laggy intro-video on PC, but I'm sure they will sort it out.\n\nAll in all a really good wargame, I highly recommend it!","September 24, 2015","true","7.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

I got shown this at a friends place. Proceeded to then buy it on Steam for myself.\n\nJust note this:\n\nThis is not a wargame per se, as soon as you can look beyond that, it becomes much better. For me, being a wargamer this was a hurdle. But once you figure out what it is it becomes a very deep experience.\n\nSo what is it then if not a wargame?\n\nWell... It's a puzzle game. It is like a mix of "area activation" euro style board games and a logic puzzler. The theme is more coincidental, but is a nice touch.\n\nThe game has two core concepts, one being the mentioned "area activation", a mechanic often seen in trading style board games. It means that a sector of the board is "activated" on your turn, and only that, so you may ONLY move units on that sector. All other units have to wait a following turn.\n\nThe second concept which is central to the game is the timeline. A unit may only move ONCE every sub-timeline (a day) then it may not move until many turns later (next day). This is where the puzzle thing happens.\n\nFor instance, in the first scenario, it is very little about winning over the enemy but a lot about logically figuring out how to reach a certain point in time, given the movement restrictions.\n\nIn multiplayer it is the same thing, with the game taking on more of an abstract view of the theme and more of a logic puzzle nature. Like how chess is about battlefield tactics, hence the pieces and move ranges, but it is so abstracted it instead is turned into a logic game of deduction. This is the same.\n\nSo wargamers should be aware of this, and instead see it as a thematic puzzle/board gaming hybrid with some great depth.\n\nWhen you do that, it becomes VERY enjoyable in it's own right. The small history articles is a nice touch also.","January 2","true","3.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It is easy to understand what is going on, the tutorial does a good job for this purpose, and the game mechanics are quite straightforward. However, there are some details which are harder to get from the beginning (like how supplies work, isolated units, attacking a forrest tile etc), which I think give the game some extra depth.
