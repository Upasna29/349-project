I am fully aware that it is early days, but i'm also aware they're open to suggestions. I recommend the game as it stands, if you are happy funding development for a game that has SO MUCH potential, and a few solid hours of enjoyment in it's current state.\n\nThings i'd personally like to see:\n\n-Less sharks (they should be terrifying when encountered, dangerous depending on the species, and you shouldn't be able to swim as fast as them and kill them with your pocket knife. Get rid of that stupid music too, a shark attack should be unexpected, this isn't Jaws.)\n-You should be able to break your raft if you hit it with a sharp object... if you're stupid enough to attack your boat, you deserve to die.\n-More island variations: It feels that every island is 'roughly' the same size, and they're all spread out at equal distances... perhaps a few islands linked together, maybe a big island with cliffs (give an element to exploring the land as well as the sea).\n-Seabirds, with eggs that you can steal to eat!\n-Saltwater crocs (danger in the shallows and on the land)\n-A character screen: Being able to equip items would make this game so much fun, like piecing together some torn rags to help shelter your skin from the sun, or making a crappy little hat to help prevent dehydration. Also when you get the diving gear, it gives a chance to equip it/unequip it...\n-Blood: Having 'blood' to monitor might be interesting too, as cutting yourself could lead to unwanted attention in the water... you should be able to fashion bandages to stop the bleeding, giving a new element to your survival.\n-Sharp coral in the shallows (in some places). This will make you have to be careful where you come ashore, as you could cut your feet.\n-Clams\n-illness: I want the fact I don't have a shelter, and it pisses it down with rain, to kill me. Or if I cut myself and don't bother rubbing that one special plant on the wound, the infection to kill me.\n-Variations on underwater wrecks (big/small boats, war planes, a lost town which was swallowed by the ocean!?)\n-Rocks pools (with the crabs in them... instead of just randomly on the beach at 'crab nests') I hate the fact the crabs are so easy to find... this game needs to be about scavenging and surviving, not just sitting and cooking crab after crab.\n-All trees should be destroyable for wood.\n-Torches (as in a fire torch)\n-The ability to build bigger better rafts! Most the time you're traveling, until you find that one 'BIG' island, with the resources to survive, you need to travel, so why not be able to pimp your ride? A wind sail from palm leaves or a rudder from wood. Places to store supplies on rafts.\n-Bee/wasp nests (you need a torch/smoke to obtain the honey safely)\n-Scorpions/Snakes/Spiders: You'll have to be careful where you tread (also going back to clothing, you can fashion shoes from coconut husks to protect your feet)\n***Fires should be maintainable instead of having to make a new one each time (ALREADY IN)\n-More interactive surroundings: For example, I think bigger stones should be movable, so you can stack them to make walls. The starfish should be movable too,  so if you want to pick one up and throw it, why not?\n-More building options: I'm tired of this 'minecraft' style building option all games give... The shelters in the game look more like something the sims would offer. I want to see actual shelters you can build, cut two trees down, place them over the top of  a boat on its side for supports, lash together palm leaves for a roof - bam a shelter. For example, making the rope a 'pin' object would be interesting, so you can 'pin' two items together, and create your own shelters this way.\n-Schools of fish\n-Coral reefs\n-Great white sharks remade (bigger for one thing... and at the moment they look like they're from pixar films)\n-Cave systems to explore (both on islands and in the water)\n-Berries (eat them at your own risk, some are poisonous)\n-A diary\n-More options for various items (improved camp fires? for example, a camp fire 'pit' (requires stones, shovel and more wood).\n\nBasically, to sum it up, I feel the game lacks the survival and creativity it potentially has. I find myself sitting on a beach, cutting down a few trees, making a minecraft shelter and eating crabs for hours until I die (of boredom).\nI want to be creating rain catchers, building a tropical paradise (to some extent... when man has nothing, everything is a luxary) better shelters, exploring the ocean with dangers everywhere, having to build new rafts because I stupidly hit my first one with an axe to see if it would break it, fighting off wild animals left right and center.","January 25, 2015","true","7.1"," 3,146 of 3,243 people (97%) found this review helpful 266 people found this review funny","97","146","3","266","162"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thirdrail1/recommended/313120/","thirdrail1","shark music","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thirdrail1/","181 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nStranded launched with a major bug in the raft. That was Friday. On Tuesday, the devs showed up with the hotfix. Not only did they fix the raft, they improved and patched a whole laundry list of stuff. And added whales! Attentive and competent.\n\nWhy is this the first thing I'm telling you about Stranded? Because it's Early Access, which means "Dev Attentiveness" is everything. I couldn't even think of reviewing this game until we'd seen them in action, at least once. Now we have seen them in action, and it was quite impressive. Not unlike the game itself.\n\nStranded is a beautiful little shipwrecked simulator. It's very basic right now, but what's here is all well done, and they've got some clever ideas.\n\nCrafting, for example, forgoes the usual subscreen, and revolves around you piling up the materials on the ground, in physical proximity. Want a spit to cook by your campfire? You can't just build a spit and place it. You can only do it if the materials are right there, next to the fire. It's tactile. It's vaguely clunky, but it's very organic. You feel like you're really standing there, trying, like Robinson Crusoe, to forge a life out of sticks and palm fronds.\n\nThe islands are another interesting design choice. They're very small, and fairly anemic. Sticks and rocks and Yuca twine. The vast majority of the game is actually out there, under the water, with the sharks. Old shipwrecks and reefs and lost containers and such. The sharks are scary. If you're from the ocean/shark phobia branch of unreasonable fears, like myself, you will find the sharks, and their obligatory accompanying obo (edit: piano) music, genuinely terrifying. The sum of all this is that you're in a hyper relaxing tropical island coconut eating game, but if you want to get anything done, you have to get in the water, and play an intensely stressful horror game with roaming bull and tiger sharks. Neat stuff.\n\nIt's all gorgeous, as the screenshots suggest. You'd never know the title was indie, or early access, by glancing at it. I thought the whales were good news, not just because whales are cool, but because it shows us that these devs are invested in their wildlife. Anyone who's played The Forest can attest to how much a robust ecosystem adds to a setting like this one.\n\nAt this point, I only have one major complaint, and that's the ocean. The ocean is too calm. It's beautiful, and the part where it has depth and you're constantly trying to figure out what's below you is amazing and immersive, but you're way off in the pacific someplace, and sea is calm as can be. Even the Gulf Coast of Florida has itty bitty waves. After the great rolling oceans of Assassin's Creed Black Flag, and the slightly less mountainous but still very rolling seas of this game's own indie cousin, Salt, the planar ocean of Stranded is like a dead rat in the punch bowl. In most games, it wouldn't matter so much, but the ocean is the star of Stranded; it rarely, if ever, leaves center stage. The fact that it is lifeless as a dish towel never stops feeling wrong.\n\nAside from that, I can't think of anything to complain about. Had they not just introduced the whales, I would worry about the sharks being too large and scary, and wish for a wider variety of sharks, including all the relatively pleasant ones that fill the real oceans. (Back in the 70s, sharks hired Steven Spielberg as a PR guy, and it was kind of a disaster. It would be nice if Stranded helped them dig out of that, a little.) But, whales. There's probably all kinds of critters coming. If there are still no nice sharks a year from now, I'll come edit this paragraph.\n\nTL;DR - Great start on a shipwrecked simulator. Devs seem to care. All is beautiful. Oceans too flat. Sharks need friends. Safe to buy.","January 28, 2015","true","5.1"," 802 of 833 people (96%) found this review helpful 77 people found this review funny","96","802","833","77","13"

The sense of exploration and adventure in this title is amazing, I often found myself needing a little courage before jumping in the water out of fear of tiger sharks or any of the other predators that lie about. Attention to detail is quite nice to, I killed a crab with my knife and then ate it to which I took damage (I'm assuming either by the shell or because it's raw) I love that this game doesn't hold you hand, it throws you on an island and you have to survive with expirementation. It gives you just enough helpful supplies to make your stay not impossible but not enough to make it easy. Even with only a couple hours of gameplay I can honestly say this game has much potential, I'm not saying it's good yet, that takes more time. But I am enjoying it.\n\nEDIT\n\nCrafting: Ok I tested out some of the crafting aspects now and I can say at the start I absolutely hated the whole drop mechanism for crafting. Basically you bundle everything on the ground and then use items and tools to craft different things from the ground. After a while I really took a liking to it however, I'm not sure why but it feels realistic. If I was on a island I can't help but believe I would start gathering and sort my materials on the ground until I decided what I should do with them, although this isn't huge I really enjoyed this method of crafting. I also like that a foundation can be either a floor or a raft, let's face it, they're not much different just a bunch of sticks tied together, really great idea making both into one craftable item. Overall I really like the Crafting system.\n\nFishing: I only fished for a short while but visually it's great, the fish stick to your spear and wiggle around a bit, feels very realistic (not that I go around stabbing fish).\n\nEDIT\n\nSharks: Shark AI seems very decent. I decided to go out and try to fight one off and it was a very close fight, the movement is what I immediately noticed, they move like a natural predator where they will sneak in for a bite then go into the depths and come back in for another attack. They're also extremely weary of confrontation so if you start swining a knife at it it will swim away. Very nice could definitely be a bit more difficult though.\n\nBugs: Currently theres a very annoying bug that will make you lose your raft in the middle of the ocean, this happened to me twice in a row where I had no choice but to swim to the island.\n\nAgain will update with more info when I see it necessary.\n\nI know people dislike this and feel free to downvote if you agree. I have a series going on on my channel I uploaded my first impressions here (not much in terms of information just me having fun with gameplay)\n\nFirst Steps (Exploration and wonder)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJeUwF_sh5s\n\nFirst night (Crafting and fishing)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXFusvgRck\n\n2nd day (Shark combat and Bugs)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRZSv3Qqvgk","January 23, 2015","true","84.5"," 739 of 782 people (95%) found this review helpful 101 people found this review funny","95","739","782","101","25"

I would like to also state, that at the time of writing this review, I only have 3 hours of playtime - and so this is more of a first impression.\n\nThe PositivesUnique game idea. Cast away being one of my favourite movies, it feels great to relive Tom Hank's struggle! And yes, it is possible to get Wilson!\n\nThis game is visually gorgeous. The sunrises and sunsets look real. The colours spread across the whole sky, and it is absolutely breathtaking. These graphics add a sense of immersion to which I have not experienced in many other games before.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=380387079\nA sunrise in Stranded Deep\n\nThe game is realistic (at times). Chipping away at a tree, then finally seeing it fall down is truley incredible, and in my opinion, much better than the Forest. This is as the tree doesn't simply split into pieces like it does in the Forest, but rather you must further cut the tree into logs, and then sticks. Again, this adds another sense of immersion to the game, making the player feel as though they are in fact stranded.\n\nThe NegativesThe game feels a bit too easy, and repetitive. You can go without eating or drinking for 2-3 days without consequence, even so, there are millions of coconuts lying around which you can drink, and 3 or 4 potato plants in each island in which regrow after a day. It is near impossible to die from hunger or thirst. I would have liked to have seen them focus more on making actual survival hard, rather than worrying about that shark (that in my opinion adds nothing to the game).\n\nCurrently, there is no end game (although they have stated that it is in the works). This wouldn't be a problem at all if actual survival was challenging.\n\nBase building is useless. So what you build a 3x3 home? You just have to move to another island at somepoint anyway. Would be better if they focused more on being able to build an awesome raft, as building a home is useless, and being mobile is key.\n\nThe VerdictIf survival is your type of game, and/or you loved the movie Cast Away, I would definitely reccomend purchasing this game as is, now! It has so much potential, and I hope to see so many more features in the future. All up, I will give it a 7/10 in it's current state, however it definitely has the potential to be the best survival game on the market.\n\nThank you for reading, should you have a question, feel free to comment, or even add me. I will respond ASAP. This being me second proper review, could you guys also leave me some constructive criticism, thanks guys!","January 24, 2015","true","2.8"," 497 of 521 people (95%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","95","497","521","35","27"

After about a few hours you are set to survive forever, get that bucket, find some crabs and you are done..\n2. Wood is a non renewable resource, best you can do is strip the surrounding islands of your home then move on\n3. If you do move on you can't tie things to your raft, can't make containers, can't make a floating home that can be relocated...you're limited to 8 inventory slots that can hold 4 of that item meaning you can't really better your situation much you're just moving to a new island to rebuild it again.\n4. the game is in serious need of things to give it life beyond finding a bucket...people need something to work toward...something to improve on and call their own..so far the game feels alot like castaway the movie...sit...eat fish...very long and boring and alone feeling, thinking it needs a dose of waterworld or gilligans island to give it some life.\n\nWould I recommend this game...yes...on the promise of what the future can hold for it.\n","May 27, 2015","true","95.9"," 481 of 505 people (95%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","95","481","505","17","5"

I paddled for ages and was incredibly excited to see the new shore. It was a small island with a wrecked ship on both it's east and west sides. After gathering a sizable pile of rocks to take back to my sad little home island, I decided to pull out my knife and explore the shipwrecks.\n\nAs I swam down into the tiny fishing trawler, I wondered how long I could hold my breath. Long enough to discover a hatchet stuffed away in a locker, and a fuel tank stored in the ship's console, and a spare lighter stored away in a toolbox. I excitedly tossed my treasure on the ground by my raft, eager to see what was located in the other ship.\n\nThis ship was much larger, maybe a crabbing boat or something. It had at least two decks. I couldn't discover the hidden gems in this thing. Oooh! Is that another hatchet? Yes! Awesome! Whoa, a machete?! Sweet, I should probably go up for air. Alright, air is sufficient. Let's go back down. Wait...what is this music? There hasn't been any music before...this sounds...ominous. Please tell me there aren't sharks in this game...OH CRAP, THAT'S A SHARK. SWIM DAMN YOU, SWIM.\n\nAfter escaping what was certain death, I went back to my raft and settled on what to take back home with me. The rocks, the fuel tank, and my beautiful new machete. The rest, I left on the beach for easy access if I ever decided to grow a pair and finish exploring that boat.\n\nAs I began paddling back to my island, I reflected on my performance while I experienced extreme fear after spotting the shark, quite happy with myself. I escaped the wrath of a frightening creature while stupidly swimming around in his home turf. I can outperform sharks, man. I'm awesome.\n\nIt was at this moment of smug satisfaction that I heard the ominous music again and immediately reverted back to fear mode, and looked around my raft in a panic, trying to spot my tormentor. Suddenly my raft was violently pushed by something below me. I flipped out and started mashing buttons in an effort to pull out my new, prized machete treasure. In my panic, I managed to press Q instead, which resulted in my hurling the tiny plastic paddle I was using to transport myself home directly at the shark's head.\n\nRealizing I was now stranded in a raft with no way to paddle back home, being circled by a large sea creature with enough teeth to completely ruin my day, I quit the game and decided to sit in bed for awhile wrapped in a cozy, warm blanket.\n\n8/10 will most definitely play again.","January 30, 2015","true","6.9"," 342 of 351 people (97%) found this review helpful 272 people found this review funny","97","342","351","272","6"

This is the meat of the game, bugs may or may not be fixed in "hot-fixes".\n\nThis is a survival game, clearly inspired by Tom Hanks "Castaway". Although new purchasers wouldn't know this because they are still advertising content that no longer exists in the game, such as that plane crash intro - etc.\n\nYou start off on a raft with no paddles, they decided they weren't "needed" any further. You somehow dog paddle to shore (whilst standing), and begin "surviving". This consists of gathering sticks, rocks, lashing (gathered from their newly modeled Yucca Plants, from one of their "big content patches"), and coconuts.\n\nYou build a fire, because that's what you always do in survival games. Then focus on a shelter for the night, because we've been taught that night time is very dangerous. You head out and gather all the neat little materials, and get to building that shelter. This makes you realize that they are only cosmetic differences because there is no competing weather elements to contend with. So now you've seen 75% of the game-play & content.\n\nOnce daylight comes, and you realize there was no threat what-so-ever over the course of the night, you decide to build a raft so you can go explore other islands. You could however doggy paddle in the given raft, but that would be silly because the sound effect for the paddling would drive you insane before you left your home island's shore.\n\nUpon watching the new island pop-in piece by piece like a stop-motion animation, you'll either be lucky and pass by a shipwreck or be unfortunate enough to contend with the pop-in later (assuming you care about finding the shipwreck). After scouting the new island for all of 1 minute you'll come to the realization that whether or not procedural generation is at play, all the islands contain the same resources, and thus it was pointless to waste your time going to this island, and a waste of your time building the raft you used to get there.\n\nThis is where the game fails; That moment you realize that there is nothing left to do. It's a defeating feeling because depending on your experience level, it may have taken you 2.1hrs to discover this, leaving you without a refund option. You now realize that there is no content in the game passed the 1hr mark. There is no survival mechanics minus infection, broken arm, food, hunger, oxygen. These are all easily negated/remedied/avoided. There is nothing that is a constant threat to your survival. All that time in the sun doesn't matter, the nights don't get cold, the wind don't bring in storms that threaten your very existence. Your biggest threat is falling from a tree due to the janky mechanics of tree climbing, rather than being eaten by a shark, of which I haven't even seen in 7hrs of game-play and 8 islands explored. Yes, depending on which version you have played, morphine probably fixed broken arms. But I can assure you that it might not in the next patch due to it breaking in the past.\n\nThe game is pretty to look at, minus the graphical glitches, and pop-in. It's a satisfying feeling to build a structure the first time, under the notion that you must do so before nightfall. But it's disheartening to see that structure floating in the sky-box the next time you login. It's disappointing to know that rebuilding one is inconsequential due to there being nothing in game to harm you or force the need of a structure.\n\nIt appears that the dev's are struck in a rut, and I wonder now if they haven't reached their coding limitations. The updates have consisted of cosmetic changes to systems that were in the game from day one. It's only when challenges are presented that we see their knowledge or lack there of come to light. We have seen this with the original crafting system, and we have seen their solution (however temporary, or however many promises are STILL being made to improve this). We have seen this when they removed the original raft, and motor, only to bring them back 8 months later. We have seen this when everyone was under the impression that they re-coded the engine, only to find that they simply upgraded to Unity 5 which left the game stagnant for nearly 2 months.\n\nAt best this is going to be a slow burn, at worse it'll be abandoned once they fail to find a way to "Jerry-rig" together a somewhat working game. That's a sad thought because the game came out with such strong potential. Those bugs in the early alpha releases were of no consequence because we simply didn't know what type of dev's we were dealing with. It's only now that we see their limitations, it's only a year later that we see the only mechanical forward progress has been by way of adding rafts back to the game. Every other change has been a removal, minus cosmetic building materials.\n\nThere simply isn't any confidence left that leads me to believe that this will ever be a true "survival game", but I'll happily update my review if that ever happens. Until that day comes though, I won't be updating this review again. They have added/removed so much content in such a short amount of time, it wouldn't even be fair to the dev's to keep making reviews. I only made this one because Sam pretty much challenged me to do so in the comments. But my question to Sam is, when are you going to update your Steam Store Page to reflect the changes in game? You were very direct with me about my "misinformation" and "dated" review, yet you continue to profit from advertising materials reflecting content that no longer exists in game.\n\nThis is the type of behavior I have experienced in the forums. I was banned for suggesting people find other ways to test out the game. I stand by that suggestion, whether that is through Steam Family Share, or other means. To say that the community isn't toxic would be a blatant lie. One only has to look as far as the comments on this review to see the negative energy coming from the people involved in this game. My review history on Steam, however short it may be, has been very fair. This is the first time I have seen a team act this way. And to suggest that they ban because there are "kids" on the forum isn't going to win favor from me, I know what they are trying to do with making statements like that, and I'm not ignorant enough to believe protecting children is their ban motivation.\n\nI'm attaching some screenshots to show the pop-in, and some other minor graphical glitches. They also show that a year later they haven't figured out a way to make cook crab not stack with uncooked crab, nor drinkable coconuts not stack with "empty" coconuts. I also took the time out of my day to do a video review, I included a timer in the video as well so you could see exactly how long it takes to reach "end-game" i.e. a content wall that's existed from launch day. I'll be appending that video as soon as I get around to uploading it.\n\nAnd for the record, every time I hit "New Game" I am given the exact same starting island over and over again. Ben explained that the starting islands are pre-made, and once you get past them they start to procedurally generate. This matters little in the grand scheme of things due to there being no real purpose to ever leave your starting island.\n\nSam: No one ever said you couldn't post a comment here. Playing victim while implying your ability to comment has been hindered only validates my review further. Your moderator commented over the span of 7 pages.\n\nScreenshots of Graphical/Gameplay Glitches:\nPop-in, Crab Stacking, Graphical Anomalies[imgur.com]\nFloating Base in Sky-Box[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]\n\nYouTube Review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL9_SLuOnQ0&feature=youtu.be","January 10","false","8.4"," 654 of 754 people (87%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","87","654","754","58","167"

The fact that this small Indie a team has a faster, better and friendlier response to its players than other Early-Access games *cough* dayz *cough* should be enough to convince you to buy this, because it means your money did not go to waste, as these devs will fix and solve the bugs you actually post.\n\nBut enough about the devs, lets talk about the game!\n\nThe intro to the game is pretty generic to survival games (crashing off a plane) but at least you get to make your own martini before descending into your doom. It is also very well made, the intro looks realistic and its not just some stupid black screen at the end of it.\n\nAfterwards you wake up on the raft you climbed on before being blown to ♥♥♥♥ with your trusty paddle and you will find a tiny island : your new home.\n\nThere you can gather resources and craft new items and tools necessary for your survival. The crafting in this game is very original, and you will not be disappointed. Instead of depending on a generic crafting screen, this game actually handles that in the physical game world, meaning you have to lay down some sticks, rope and rock before you before you can start crafting your spear.\n\nYou have the ability to hunt crabs (easiest) or fish from the ocean, even bigger fish near the reefs and deeper into the water. Hell, if you're brave enough you can actually chase that stupid shark thats been circling your beloved raft for so long, and kill it, and COOK IT! As of now you cant eat shark fin soup, but you can still eat the fin, and other parts.\n\nThe cooking is quite realistic, you will have to wait a while before your crabs become crispy and tasty, instead of insta-cooking.\n\nYou will have to manage your resources as they are quite finite, which after a while will force you to navigate to other islands in search for more wood and rocks. Especially if you want to build a nice big hut.\n\nThis game has a few bugs, but none of them are game-breaking which is something very worth your money these days.\n\nThe main reason why I think you should get this game is because it has so damn much potential. And when all the amazing new features start coming in you will start to realize how you should have bought this game early on, you can wait, sure. But you'll miss out on alot of fun. It is always nice to support such a promising game. Even more when you've got community friendly devs, and amazing gameplay.\n\n50/10 - would live off crabs and coconuts again","February 5, 2015","true","64.7"," 292 of 316 people (92%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","92","292","316","64","3"

There are already so many hack and slash games, why spoil this one with completely unrealistic animal behaviour. Sharks are (together with killer whales) the top predators of the marine world, but are no brainless killing machines, quite the opposite. These animals have very complex and even social patterns of behavior. I would like to see more of that in the game. It is known that shipwrecked persons have been floating and bobbing for weeeks before they were rescued; crossing the short distance between islands should therefore not trigger systematic and relentless attacks.\n\nEDIT:\nAfter several updates the shark behavior has been changed. They are much more realistic now.\nAs there will be several play modes I think everybody will be able to choose, among other things, the behavior of sharks.\n\nWhat would I love to see added in the (according to my taste) perfect game:\n\nDURING THE DAY:\n\n- Seagulls that try to steal unprotected meat and fish but can be chased away or even killed (bow, spear) and eaten after removing the feathers and cooking them.\n- Albatrosses flying by\n- Mockingbirds flying around, and singing in the trees at dawn and sunset\n- Sea birds that hunt fish (maybe nests with eggs for you to steal)\n- Flies that bother you at the warmest moments of the day and sit on spoiled food\n- Different species of butterflies, wasps, bumblebees, beetles, ants...\n- Small lizards that hunt insects\n- Sea turtles laying eggs in the warm sand (eggs make big omelettes)\n- Huntable seals resting on the coast\n- Small groups of dolphins playing and hunting fish, scaring away sharks, so it is safe to swim and paddle\n\nDURING THE NIGHT:\n\n- Moths flying around light sources\n- Mosquitoes that sometimes harass you with their noice and/or bites and wake you up in the middle of the night (repellent = garlic, treatment = banana peel)\n- Bats to hunt moths and mosquitoes\n- Crickets to liven up your nights\n- Hutias (small rodents, aka banana rats)\n\nIMMERSION:\n\n- After a storm floatable items are left washed ashore (suitcase, bag, box, wood, clothe, bottles with or without message etc.)\n- Detachable and usable containers in shipwrecks\n- Respawnable medical plants that can be harvested to fight intoxication (garlic), insect bites (banana peel), fever (cayenne) open wounds (papaya) etc.\n- Constructable drying rack to dry medical herbs before use and to dry fish/meat for conservation\n- Slowly respawnable coconuts and even more slowly growing plantable palmtrees from coconuts\n- Splint to heal broken bones (stick, cloth, rope, papaya)\n- After eating a coconut half, the empty shell can be used to fuel the campfire\n- Occasionally a disgruntled moray eel in a ship wreck\n- Here and there a small cave on some of the bigger islands\n- Raft (with sides and place for a chest)\n- Varying wind directions and strenghts, including calm\n- Cooking pot, frying pan to make soup, omelettes and to sterilize cloths for bandage\n- Sleep is necessary to stay healthy\n- Constructable shelf between two supports to put small items and boxes with dried medical herbs and food so they do not fall trough the foundation on the ground\n- After discovering the second island a map system becomes available\n- Possibility to build a storage foundation to safeguard your precious items when later in the game small tsunamis could wash away items lying on the ground\n- Distant thunderstorms lighting up the horizon with little rain on your island\n- Anchor point to attach raft and life boat on the coast to avoid losing it (tide, floods)\n- Bow (2 sticks, 2 ropes) and arrows (8 arrows per stick, 8 arrow-heads per rock)\n\nI know this is quite a lot, but I am longing for the perfect cast away experience - a balance\n\nbetween feel-good experiences and challenges. Looking for safety in a harsh environment and slowly\n\nbuilding up a home in an unlikely place. At the end becoming a happy Robinson Crusoe.\n\nThanks for creating this game, hope to keep it playing for a long time.

Was drowning under water while still in the plane. Couldn't find the exit for three whole minutes, good thing I can hold my breath for gratuitous amounts of time. Both pilots... KIA. Serves them right, wouldn't even let me in the cockpit. Had to make myself a martini instead. Getting drunk fixes everything. Except finding exits.\nAnyway, I swam to a conveniently placed lifeboat outside of the plane. Then paddled my ♥♥♥ to a conveniently placed island just a few yards away. Saw three sharks in the space of thirty seconds, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants twice. Realized that weird ominous music whenever a shark is around. It's like an ipod with teeth. Got to the island and ate a potato. Built the frame of a house. Tried to build a fire. No such luck. Had to spend my night on the beach next to a pile of crabs (just like sleeping next to my ex girlfriend).\n\nDay 2:\nFinally figured out how to start a fire. Logs burned out before night even fell. So it goes...\nBuilt a fort. Felt like a kid again. Looked like crap and had holes in the roof, but it kept me dry when it rained all the next day. Ate another potato.\n\nDay 3:\nThe heavy rains came. I stayed crouched in my makeshift fort. No fire. No water. Nothing but my last potato.\n\nDay 4:\nAte a raw crab. Almost died. Somehow my watch now tells me all of vitals. Trippy potatoes, man. I cooked the next crab, worked just fine. Decided I was bored on my little oasis, got back in my raft and paddled toward another island. Halfway across the sea my raft disappeared and plunged me into the ocean. I just about **** myself. I started doggypaddling as fast as possible. And then it came. An ipod with teeth somewhere in my vicinity. I got away. But then there was another ahead of me. I circled around and somehow made it to the island. This one was worst than the last. And now I'm trapped here. No fire, no water, no raft... just a soggy potato.\n\nI'm putting this message in a bottle. If anyone reads this... please send to my ex girlfriend, Kaleigh.

The crafting mechanics here are a bit more realistic, as you don't have a magic manual that conveniently found you on the island, giving you recipes and guides on what to do. You aren't spoon fed and you'll need to find out what to craft and how to craft it on your own (unless you look up a guide).\n\nThe developer didn't give us a game that was half-baked.

You seem distressed, no doubt business is taking its toll on you and the plane going through turbulence doesn't exactly help, luckily you are the only passenger. You decide to ease your sorrows with a martini. As you return to your seat to go through some more spreadsheets the plane starts shaking violently until suddenly, you come to realise you might not make this trip. Your fears quickly become reality.\nThe jet's fuselage is getting torn to shreds, the inside becomes a tornado of clutter as all sorts of objects start getting vacuumed outside. You're pressed against the back of your seat, gasping for air, as the plane loses altitude... until it crashes into the sea. As you recover from the trauma, you start swimming toward the cockpit, only to find the two pilots dead. Wasting no time, you escape the wreck and climb into a life raft. You make for the nearest bit of land as to not get dragged down with what used to be your only way back to civilisation. You are stranded. Deep.\n\nWith this introduction, I hope the scenery is set for Stranded Deep, a survival game in Early Access now available on Steam. The scenery is important here, because it is all the story we get at this point in time. You know you're in trouble and have to make the best of it for as long as you can. You start with nothing more than a lighter, a pocket knife, a bottle of water and your life raft (plus paddle). To survive, you will need to stay well-fed and hydrated. Eating crabs, fish or native potatoes and drinking from a coconut or boiling seawater over a fire should keep you covered. There is also a crafting-system ingame, which lets you craft primitive tools for when your metal ones break.\nPerhaps most interestingly, the island you are stranded on is tiny, not much more than a pile of sand and rock with a few palm trees here and there. This means that you will only have access to a very finite pool of ressources like wood. To find more, you must inevitably climb back into your life raft (or a wooden one you've built) and start exploring the ocean around you. The world is potentially huge, depending on how far out you're willing to go, with more and more small islands appearing on the horizon. Exploration doesn't end there, though, as the ocean floor holds more secrets for you to discover. Ship-wrecks scatter the landscape below and do have loot for you to find, like proper tools or other useful items like goggles or a ship motor to stick on your raft.\nCarelessly bathing in the rough seas can be dangerous, though, as a very hungry shark might start thinking about making you part of his dietary plans. Shark AI seems very much unfinished at this point, though personally, sharks really freak me out so just their presence is enough to at the very least be very unsettling.\nIt's not just the sharks that need some more polish, as Early Access suggests. Surviving by doing the same few tasks over and over is all you can really do in Stranded Deep at this point and exploring will just reward you with more of the same. Building shelter has no real purpose and, sadly, there is no way of getting rescued yet, though plans are to include more end-game as development goes on. The two things that Stranded Deep has going for it are its unique setting and the stunning graphics, inviting you to forget about your dire situation and just bask in the tropical sun.\n\nStranded Deep is worthy of at least being followed by survival-fans. Probably not a purchase just yet.\nAlso, not a single Castaway-joke. Good job me.","January 29, 2015","true","2.0"," 207 of 227 people (91%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","91","207","227","37","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morkymouse/recommended/313120/","morkymouse","Monkey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morkymouse/","128 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI really enjoy this game, it's well made and definitely worth $15 even in it's current state. Here's a breakdown of gameplay, graphics, environment, crafting, bugs, and ultimately - why I would recommend this game.\n\nGameplay:\n\n-Pretty fun to explore shipwrecks and find stuff\n-Made a motorized raft (which totally kicks ♥♥♥)\n-Conquered multiple islands for my own greedy needs\n-Built a fortress with a lookout tower and used binoculars to spot sharks\n-Still haven't found my good friend Wolly\n-Murdered crabs and ate them in front of their friends\n-Drank then ate numerous coconuts\n-Palm trees are now extinct\n\nGameplay is great, crafting system is really unique and I like it, it seems realistic, like you're actually putting stuff together instead of some wizardry where walls and foundations just appear. Although at this point there's not much to do, this game has really good potential (I'll elaborate more on this at the end).\n\nGraphics:\n\nThis game is very nice looking, and has a really nice feel of realism to it. The only thing I'd want more with the graphics is better antialiasing, a fix for the weird lines you can see in the distance separating the areas of water, and further render distance.\n\nEnvironment:\n\nThe environment is very nice, there are plenty of sea animals and dangers. Sharks, whales, crabs, many types of fish, and more to come in the future. The islands are all pretty standard and have numerous palm trees, rocks, and a few yucca plants for lashings (rope). My favorite part about the environment is the water and shipwrecks. The water is awesome and it really feels real when you're swimming around exploring. The shipwrecks are interesting to explore and often have very useful loot like buckets (which you fill with seawater then boil to make it drinkable), parts to make an engine for your raft, and other useful items like flashlights and bandages.\n\nCrafting:\n\nI love the crafting system in this game. I've never seen anything like it before. Instead of having to combine recipes through a crafting menu, you actually put the stuff together on the ground, hold left click, and select the item you want to make. To make tools you hold anything, but to build foundations, walls, and other building materials, you need to be holding a hammer. The crafting is very well done, no complaints about it.\n\nBugs:\n\nThis is the least buggy early access game I've ever played. At initial release, there were a few bugs such as disappearing raft, flying sharks, and low sound quality rain, but those were all fixed very quickly. As of now, the only bugs/glitches I know of are the double/triple paddle and flying with palm trees. Very solid game with few bugs.\n\nWhy I Recommend This Game:\n\nThe developers of this game are great, because the game actually gets updates, and said updates actually add content and fix bugs (looking at you, DayZ). This game has so much potential and with the development roadmap going the way it is, I'd love to see multiplayer co-op and much more content in this game in the future. Keep up the good work, devs!","February 16, 2015","true","27.3"," 128 of 131 people (98%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","98","128","131","16","1"

I too am a big survival game genre fan, but I can't recomend this game in it's current state. As of now you can do 90% of what this game has to offer within 2 hours (no joke). The remaining 10% is just tedious to acquire (boat motor and building fortresses). At 5 hours, I have done everything in this game many times. This game is great, and has potential, but it is simply lacking content. Maybe later down the line this game will be better, but since it's release in Janurary to now (may 30) very little has been added. So, if the devs can add more (and actually add somthing) this game would be great, but definitly wait to buy.\n\nEdit: As of June 19th, about 6 months since release, this game seems to be falling into the early-access hell hole. The devs are consistently falling behind their monthly update schedule so they decided to release an expiremental-early-access build, even that is barely being updated. It's also been about 3 weeks since them showing any signs of life. I know they are working hard, but we need more communication. As of now my older position stands...just wait until later down the line. At this point this game might not be done in years.\n\nEdit Edit: read comments to review also\n\nEdit Edit Edit: Still no major content.

On arrival I notice the only local inhabitants I can find is a population of what I would now describe to be extremely delicious crabs. Armed with just a knife, paddle and lighter I managed to construct a fairly crude fire in order to cook the local population on. My hunger levels are starting to ease, however I am extremely thirsty and I do not wish to waste the precious water I managed to carry from the wreckage of my plane.\n\nWith my remaining time I have managed to construct a bed in which to sleep. I will continue the journal tomorrow.\n\nDay 2, 13th August\n\nI awoke blinking and almost blinded by the sun and overwhelmed by the heat. I had only forgotten for a brief moment my current situation. After gathering my senses I set out to start creating some crude tools with which to hunt, cook and craft. I do not yet know how I am going to make a spear, as there appear to be very few rocks around the shoreline on this barren hell I now call home.\n\nI managed to somehow scrape enough stone together however to make a crude yet effective axe. Again, night time beckons and I have already eaten my fill of crab for the day.\n\nDay 3, 14th August\n\nI awake to yet again be smacked in the face by the damning reality of my current predicament. With no-one to socialise with, I feel I may become more and more like the crazy stranded hermits I had seen in motion pictures before the crash, talking to coconuts and dancing around fires during the middle of the night. I will not let myself succumb to this.\n\nI had spotted just off shore a small sunken vessel, browned with metal decay from the salty waters of my surroundings. I waded out to the vessel to search the cabin and to my surprise, found a woodcutting axe, a lantern and some bandages. Whoever was stranded here in the past or whoever left these supplies clearly perished. I feel their misfortunes are now my savior.\n\nDay 4, 15th August\n\nAfter yesterday's apparent success I have made a formal decision to abandon the idea of living the remainder of my time out on this sandy, dusty hell and I have chosen to gather the supplies I have and make for land...or at least just somewhere else.\n\nSo far I have not encountered any other wildlife, aside from crabs and sardines just off the shore and continue to rely on that to be my main source of survival. I managed to open some coconuts in order to drink the succulent milk from within. It was like nectar as I had used the remaining fresh water I still had yesterday. Night has dawned...dreamless sleep awaits...\n\nDay 5, 16th August\n\nRising early, I made for the raft and paddle and begun pushing it out to sea. My pack is filled with cooked crabs as I realised this may be a long journey. After eating some food I set out for new horizons, not fully understanding what I was about to run into. I had believes my solidarity from living things had been my great advantage so far, however things were about to change very quickly.\n\nPaddling towards a small speck I could see in the distance and at this point could only determine to be another god forsaken island I stopped for a moment to observe the scenary. There are many of these barren wastelands dotted all over the sea and I do not know how far I am from the main land at this point. I think to myself, where could I possibly go to be safe? At this very moment the raft moves from underneath me. Startled by the feeling of what was a fin I could only look over the edge of my raft slowly, trembling with fear and anticipation of what may arise from the depths. In this moment there was silence, only the sound of the ocean's waters lapping against my raft. Still trembling I waited, with bated breath, when suddenly a Tiger Shark appeared from the side of my raft and began swimming quickly towards me. Panicking, I swung wildly with my axe, however this made no difference. The shark knocked me into the water and sent my raft veering away from me. I am now officially in hell. With the shark slowly circling me and moving ever closer I feel the need to get back to the raft, so I do. Quickly I swim towards it and manage to board it. With my hands now shaking uncontrollably I reach for my paddle and begin frantically paddling towards the shore of a nearby island.\n\nOn arrival I come to an understanding that it was my lack of preparation that caused this inevitable scenario.\n\nDay 6, 17th August\n\nIt's raining. It hasn't stopped raining all morning. All throughout the night it continued to pour as I had spent all night hacking away at the local foliage, in order to gather enough resources to construct a crude dwelling. From my watch, it says it is 7:30am. I am now squatting uncomfortably in my shack, wondering where I go from here. Over my breakfast of crab...again...I come to the idea that perhaps the best way to survive is to hunt the very thing I have now learned to fear. Perhaps this will be my downfall. Now, it seems like the only option.\n\nUsing a rock I smashed earlier this morning and some sticks found lying on the beach, I have managed to make myself two crude, yet sharp spears to combat my underwater foe. Climbing into my raft with my paddle, spears and axe I make my way to open water. Whilst paddling, I notice a brown pipe breaking the top of the water. This can only be the top of a mast of a ship sunken underwater. After gathering my bravery, I took the decision to dive into the water, completely unaware of any danger in my immediate surroundings. Diving deeper, I open the door to the ship, just touching the sea bed and make my way inside. After opening a couple of lockers I have found a torch, a propeller and a jerry can and within a chest in the main room of the ship's interior I have found some flares. Making my way to the surface to find my raft, I then paddle back to shore and deposited my loot into my shack and waited out the rest of the day. It's now too late to go hunting sharks and I do not wish to do this at night time.\n\nDay 7, 18th August\n\nThe days are starting to blur together, it feels like a week has now passed and I am still no closer to rescue. My idea to hunt sharks is my objective today, so with spear in hand I make my way to the open ocean once more in my trusty life raft. Here I sit, waiting for my prey...or demise...\n\nAfter no longer than 3 minutes on the water I see a dark fin making it's way towards me. With a steady hand I waited until my prey moved closer and then delivered a short, sharp stab with my spear. A solid strike. The shark twitched in irritation. This has clearly angered the beast as he quickly circled back and begun heading towards me once more. Another few strikes as he passed the raft, he is clearly now extremely angry and has begun attempting to ram me from my raft, diving after each attempt. However, during each attempt I manage to land a few blows here and there, wounding the shark. He makes his way for deeper waters and just as he begins to swim away, I land the strike that kills him. I had done it. I had done the impossible. My predator has been vanquished and I have dragged his carcass aboard my raft. With my paddle in hand and my prey laying on my lap, I make my way for shore swiftly, so the beast has no time to foul from the wounds suffered.\n\nUpon arriving on shore, I drag him towards my crude hut and fire and begin to butcher him for the meat. I realise now I will be eating shark soon and will not go hungry for a number of days. As I begun to cook the portions of shark, I could not help but feel elation at my victory and began to laugh uncontrollably. After a brief moment of insanity I regain my composure, only to look across the ocean for a brief moment to spot another two fins...\n\nIt would appear I won't go hungry again for a long time yet......","February 9, 2015","true","39.6"," 193 of 221 people (87%) found this review helpful 128 people found this review funny","87","193","221","128","6"

The content rollout is virtually nonexistant, and the current content can be "cleared" in under 2 hours. Admittedly, since this is a survival game, you can spend an infinite amount of time roasting crabs and building houses with the dozen crafting items available, but once you've done that, it's just a bunch of proceduraly-generated islands and the occasional whale and rusted outpost with nothing of any significance to do. Once you've seen about three islands, you've seen them all. The game content is virtually identical to how it was at launch, six months ago.\n\nWhile I don't expect much content from an Early Access title, the rate at which content is being added is one of the worst I've ever seen. There has been only one real content update in nearly six months (since the Early Access release), the rest being just generic bugfixes (many of which are persistant and game-breaking) and maybe adding a handful of fish in the ocean. Even the (one) content update was extremly minor, like something I would expect out of a weekly or biweekly update from another developer. I'm understanding that an initial release of an Early Access title is going to be light on content. I'm not understanding when six months later the developers haven't delivered anything since (especially after all the money that's been collected from players).\n\nI had great hopes for this title, and while I still hope the developer can push something to release, I cannot recommend a purchase at this time, given the pace of development. It almost feels like someones game that they put together for a school project and then forgot about, or like the pet project of someone who just works on it a few hours on weekends, not a game from a serious development team.\n\nIf these things change in the future, my recommendation will as well, but with similar Early Access games releasing content on a near-weekly basis and showing futures for their games, there are far better places to spend your $15 than Stranded Deep.","June 29, 2015","false","3.6"," 295 of 359 people (82%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","82","295","359","13","16"

It has its bugs here and there, much as most early access titles do, but overall, they don't affect the game all that much.\n\nI don't have hundreds of hours in the game like some people do, but I still feel I can highly recommend this game to anyone at all who enjoys horror/survival games. When you first begin the game, there really is a sense of almost hopelessness. You sit in a raft out on the open ocean, a shark circling nearby. Personally, I have a terrible fear of sharks and the ocean in general, even the video for the game in the store page deterred me at first lol.\n\nMy first few hours in the game were tragic. I ignored the shark and paddled as fast as I could towards the closest island, noticing a shipwreck very close to the island itself. I knew they were very important and felt I should brave the waters just for a chance of finding a compass or a piece of dive gear early on.\n\nHuge mistake...\n\nI jumped out of my raft almost directly on top of a Lionfish. The screen went green and I facepalmed. Having watched YouTube videos of the game, I knew this was bad. I made my way to the shipwreck, but found just a bucket of sea water and a pocket knife.\n\nDisappointed, I exited the cabin of the boat and started to swim towards the surface. I had Regular Show playing through my headset in the background, forgetting that sharks have a warning in the form of music. I never heard it coming. Just as I surfaced, a Tiger shark attacked me. I screamed like a little girl, my girlfriend sitting nearby laughed herself to tears. After it drug me under the water and let me go, I swam in a panic to the island, my heart still racing.\n\nI sat back for a moment and took in my situation. Poisoned, horribly maimed, hungry and thirsty. Great.\n\nI remember my bottle of water from the raft and drink the little amount within it, topping off my thirst. That's one problem taken care of for the moment. I need food now. I quickly remember watching countless YouTubers gathering coconuts. I look around and find that not a single palm tree on the island I first landed upon is even remotely short, but they do have that glorious food and water source hanging from them. I slowly climbed up the tree and clicked my first coconut so it drops. Being still unfamiliar with the controls however, I immediately fall right after my food, breaking my arm...\n\nNow I'm poisoned, maimed and have a broken limb. Fantastic....At least I got my coconut.\n\nI spent the next 4 hours of my playtime making terrifying dives into the ocean trying to find the cures to my problems. 4 hours of constant eating and drinking, gathering coconuts and cooking crabs and sardines. 4 hours of wreck after wreck containing no medical supplies. 4 hours of paddling, injured and poisoned, through waters containing sharks still because I was hurt and way too afraid to jump into the water with them and risk dying.\n\nI found Morphine first, broken limb fixed. The very next wreck contained Antibiotics. Wonderful! No more poison. From that point on, I was able to heal to full, move normally and do my thing how I wanted to, unhindered. Now I have a HUGE home in progress, more food than I could ever need, medical supplies, buckets to collect rain, and much, much more.\n\nAll of that was a wonderful experience for me. Without it, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the game as much as I have so far, and I would definitely not be writing this review lol.\n\nI can not recommend this game enough to anyone who enjoys this genre.\n\nStranded Deep\n10/10\nWould do it all again\n\nI hope you enjoyed this review and found it useful.","May 25, 2015","true","26.8"," 162 of 186 people (87%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","87","162","186","46","2"

It seems that unless a game gets weekly updates, people will complain about it.\n\nThe recent updates to the experimental branch (both Sept and Nov updates) showcase what is being worked on including a whole new ocean, new terrain system, new crafting system and in the most recent update a map editor.  There is still a lot of work to be done as this game is very much in development.  And given the magnitude of some of the changes, one should expect that updates are going to be sporadic.\n\nShould you buy it?  It depends.  The older stable branch contains a lot of the earlier designs and is reasonably enjoyable.  I was able to get 10 hours of gametime out of it which I consider money well spent.  The newer experimental branch is a glimmer of things to come, but is still incomplete and needs polishing to be properly playable.  It does give a promising glimpse of this game's future and the future looks good.","November 11, 2015","true","15.1"," 119 of 140 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","119","140","7","22"

I enjoyed and longed for that fun feeling of you being alone, fending for yourself with your little shelter, and Wilson. When I first played this, it was amazing. Yes, it "had potential." The gameplay was very solid, yet there was little content. It was worth it as I liked the concept however, and figured I would enjoy coming back every so often to check out updates, and play a little bit further.\n\nI felt I would just re-write this entire part, and give a bit of a more detailed explanation on why I wouldn't reccomend it at this point.\n\nThe Dev pointed out that I was just being stupid about the cooking system, and it does still work. I didn't hear the "ding" of the food being cooked on one occasion, but I might have been too far away possibly, which is my own fault. I wanted to come back and edit this, because I certainly don't want to mislead or flat out tell false things about the game, as the EA system is already messed up as it is. I also appreciate that they took the time to correct me, and point out I was wrong, instead of flat out deleting the review like many devs in EA tend to be doing these days. As it is, the game doesn't have a bad dev team working for it, nor is it a bad game even. It's just very "bare."\n\nWhen I came back and played it, I was frustrated. It was probably the reason my review was a bit overly harsh. I was already planning on editiing this before my error on the cooking system was pointed out. I look forward to coming back to a lot of the EA games I have purchased over the years and this was one I had a lot of hopes for. The past several times I have come back, the game seems to either be missing things it had, or changed things that really didn't matter. There are new things added, for sure. Having a character model to look down at is definately a nice touch, and the raft building system is a great start to something potentially amazing.\n\nThe downside is just that, nothing drastic has changed in that time since I first purchased it. Which is sad, because this game has a lot of things going for it. Currently though, after a year of development, the world is still very small, there is very little to actually do, and it doesn't have a whole lot of depth (pun intended) to it. The only adversary other than the obnoxious noise the bats make at night, is the sharks. The AI for the sharks however is still very basic, and glitchy. It's good to see they aren't still swimming under the sand though, at least as far as I could tell. Because of this, you end up just swimming from island to island from sheer boredom.\n\nThis all comes down to if I'd reccomend the game or not, and after giving it even more time tonight, I'd still say no. Not right now, at least. I'd wait on this one, and watch the updates. There needs to be a lot more substance to this game before it's worth the price tag. If it goes on sale though, and these games are up your alley (or you just want to RP as Tom Hanks) then I'd for sure pick this up.\nSorry this review is a bit wordy, I tend to do that a lot. If reading overly wordy reviews is your thing, if not;\n\nTL;DR. Game isn't bad, has promise. Too long between updates, too little updated. Wait for awhile until game has more to offer.","May 3","false","8.1"," 176 of 222 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","176","222","7","5"

Although it's still in development, Stranded Deep will manage to impress any survival fan. Not only does it has a fun crafting engine and an easy to use base-building system, but it also manages to balance performance and graphics in several ways. I can easily recommend this and say that's it's one of my new favorites.\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful tropical island setting, Impressive graphics\n- Fun and easy Crafting, Rafting, and Base-Building system\n- Explore shipwrecks. Find a shark. Kill a shark/Get killed by a shark\n- Customizsble island-chain map when starting a new game\n- Map Editor - Build your own island and place it in your game\n- Devs are pretty OP. Game is fairly consistant with updates and devs are responsive in the forums.\n- Really neat 'Spoiling' mechanic. Food goes bad. Raw food and salt water makes you sick.\n\nCons:\n- Bugs and glitches here and there. Nothing gamebreaking.\n- Cannot break down base materials once they're built. You can destroy, but not recycle.\n- Some of the keybindings and controls are a bit odd. Can be changed.\n- I'm sick of coconuts\n\nBy the way, It is indeed a 'Cast Away' Simulator. For those who know the film, you'll easily find a handful of things that Stranded Deep takes inspiration from.\n\nThese include:\n- The intro\n- You basicaly only eat coconuts, crabs, & fish\n- Some of the tools look like the ones used in the film\n- Some of the things you can build look fimiliar\n- There's a 'DeadEx' package somewhere\n- You can find Wilson "....WILSON!!!..oh thank god...Never again..."\n\nOverall - 8.5/10\nCould use a bit more work, nothing much to complain about. This is just a beautiful game and rather peaceful to play...until you run into a shark that is.\n\nEven if you aren't much of a survival fan, I would highly recommend this game. I believe I bought this game on sale, but the price for this game is fair. This is one game where you definitely get your money's worth.

Most other survival games play like a race or a time trial: "You must kill and eat a bear every 3 minutes to survive, or you will starve to death. Ready, get set, GO!" Thankfully, Stranded Deep is not that frantic, and is actually more realistic. Because you're on small islands, and sharks are the main enemy, you're not facing a serious risk until you try to leave your starting island. You can sit on your island, cook crabs, climb trees for coconuts, and build tools for basically as long as you need to. The pace is slower and the player is allowed more time to build their power, because there aren't monsters around every corner waiting to kill you 3 minutes after the game starts.\n\nHowever, that does not mean the game is easy. Eventually, you will need to leave your island. You'll run out of wood to burn, or you'll run out of water, or something. Once you decide to leave, that's where the game gets challenging. You see, as soon as you venture into deep water, you'll run into the main enemy: sharks. They're in total control in the water, and it's easy for them to flip your raft, leave you bleeding, or worse. This creates the interesting dynamic I mentioned earlier; the player can choose when to take risks, by choosing when to enter deep water. This creates a system where the islands are safe havens, filled with food and resources, and the player can either choose to make the game difficult by advancing quickly, or easy by advancing slowly, consolidating your skills, banking food and water, and playing it safe (which is actually surprisingly similar to how real, deliberate survival attempts turn out).\n\nAs I mentioned, Stranded Deep is about long-term survival, not short and frantic races. Stranded Deep rewards common sense and critical thinking skills. Many items can be interacted with in realistic ways... You don't need a +10 Mithril Crafting Hammer to break rocks. You just need a small rock and a big rock, and a brain. The game rewards observation, and rewards players who behave realistically. It punishes players who behave recklessly. This can make the game slow at times, but overall it lends a sense of believability, and makes it more meaningful when you finally find an island worthy of use as a home base.\n\nAdditionally, many games also cherry-pick their screens, capturing the very few spots in the game that actually look good to provide a false representation of the graphics to potential buyers. Stranded Deep is much more honest; it actually looks as good as the screens. And, as a bonus, it's well optimized! It'll actually run maxed out on lower end hardware at playable framerates, like a GTX 750 and Pentium G3258, or thereabouts. Many other Early Access games look far worse than this and require top-tier hardware, which is just silly.\n\nOverall, Stranded Deep is much more realistic and also more fun than other survival games. It has more natural pacing, and a more compelling risk/reward dynamic, and it's well optimized.","July 12, 2015","true","6.5"," 144 of 177 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","144","177","5","2"

All the Animals like Sharks and Crabs are well designed and have nice Animations like biteing and running.\nThe Crabs a terrible, sometimes they run like on drugs and other times they come to the Slaughter :D\n\nThe Atmosphere of the Game is great, totally alone on an island and around too much Tiger Sharks. Dont loose your Paddle and your Lighter too, dont loose it!!! :D\n\nThe Crafting in this state of Development have a few Objects like Spears (for Fishing), Axes to chop off trees and palms, a hammer and a Campfire what can be upgraded for longer use and cook Animals. There will be a lot more Recipes with the next updates.\n\nThe realistic craft with store all on the earth ist a bit difficult, sometimes it shows only campfire but not what i want to really craft or upgrade the campfire.\n\nAlso you can dive a lot for Treasure Chests and other loot in some shipwrecks lying around the isles, but beware the Sharks.\n\nOk thats the Pros, the Cons come now..\n\nThere are many bugs in between with the Sharks or the Boat. You can handle the Boat like a car and drive over the Isles and the water, no harm no problem. Sometimes the sharks attack and bite but then from one Moment to another they stop and dont want to eat me, the dont see me anymore, they swim around me, but nothin happens...ok\n\nWhat i want to say its a normal Early-Access Phase, there are bugs, some funny and others are creepy and you loose your life, but its all normal and ok. Its a very fine Game and i would be surprised if its not.\n\nWhen you love Survival Games like The Forest (i know its not like Forest Dudes), Salt or Grav you will love the Game, all others dont buy it in Early-Access.\n\nGuide for Crafting:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=379844357\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=379956203\n\n+++ Gefällt Euch das Review und wollt mehr Reviews von mir lesen so schaut doch mal bei meiner Kurator-Seite vorbei: Reviews von Jadefelsen! +++","January 23, 2015","true","14.2"," 123 of 148 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","123","148","7","1"

I got to the point where I wanted a fire pit instead of the campfire. The problem was I didn't have enough rocks. Can't be too hard to go out and grab a few rocks right?\n\nI decided to venture off to a nearby island. I left my binoculars I found in a shipwreck, thinking since it was so close that I wouldn't need them. Boy was I wrong!\n\nI got to the second island fine, found my rocks and headed back out. I went in the direction I came from and felt pretty confident that it was the right direction. Out of the three islands I could see, I chose the wrong one. No biggie I thought, just head off to the next one.\n\nAs I paddled to the next island, things went very wrong. Just as I left a storm started coming in. I figured it I kept my crosshair steady I could paddle through. Then I heard it...the shark music. In a panic I spun around to see where it was coming from. Turning back I realized that I now had no clue where I was. The storm was now worse and I couldn't see any islands at all.\n\nI decided to sit down and wait for it to pass. Unfortunately the sharks had other plans. They started nudging my boat, trying to knock me out. I didn't fall out and decided to take some screenshots of the sharks. Feeling comfortable, I "shift-tabbed" out to look at my shots. Bad move!\n\nWhen I came back to the game I was in the water. With a knot in my stomach, I pulled out my machete and started chasing the sharks around in a panic. I stabbed them a few times and realized I wasn't effecting them with this weapon.\n\nComing up for air, I noticed my raft and mad a mad dash for it. I got back in my raft and was "safe" once again. Unfortunately now it was turning to night and the sharks were now circling my raft.\n\nI was able to make it till dawn without any other incidents. Now it was time to pick a direction. I did and began my rowing. The first Island I came to was not my starter island (of course). At this point I considered starting a new here. It was very unlikely I would ever see my original home again. Instead I started off for another try.\n\nThis time I came back to the second island I got the rocks from. Now I had a chance. I found where I thought I arrived the first time I was there and headed out. After another failed island attempt, I finally came across the started island I call home. I never thought I would see it again. It was such a great feeling to see my hut again.\n\nThat was one of the craziest self guided adventures I have ever been on in a game! With more stuff to craft and do, this game will be even more amazing.\n\nThe fire pit looks great next to my bed by the way!","January 29, 2015","true","4.0"," 64 of 66 people (97%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","97","64","66","26","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hey_there/recommended/313120/","Hey_there","Sans the Skeleton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hey_there/","355 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nStranded Deep is an entirely new experience for me, seeing as deep sea survival games are about as rare as they come. But rare isn't always good, and a new experience isn't always the best one. Fortunately, Stranded Deep is far from a horribly rare game, and it's new experience is one that I'll be glad to remember. I'll be covering graphics, gameplay, physics, AI, and overall thoughts in their own seperate paragraphs.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics in this game are breathtaking to say the least. The water's effects and look in this game are probably some of the best I've seen, maybe even the best as far as indie games go. For example, the sun refracts off the ocean rather realistically spreading out across the waves when it's much more set. Not to mention when you're looking into the deep blue, it can easily seem to go on endlessly, raising a few fears in some of the more excitable of gamers. This alone is a pretty impressive feat, in my opinion at least, seeing as water in video games is rarely done well at all, and usually hardly even looks/behaves like water. The actual islands however are a mixed bag. From a glance, the islands look beautiful, usually lush with flora and plentiful with fauna on its beaches; crabs mainly. However, once you take a closer look at the island, that's when you'll start to see some of the cracks on this otherwise gorgerous game. Trees that aren't of the palm variety don't like to seem to spawn correctly half the time. While some trees look fine, perfectly in the ground, others are either partically floating above the ground, and others are too deep, seeing as you're literally able to see where the roots and trunk of the tree simply vanish into the ground. The same can be said for rocks, furns, and even large rocks sometimes. This problem also happens with crates and consoles you find in plane and ship wrecks. Some of the time, the crates or consoles can be partically clipping into its boat or plane.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay for Stranded Deep is very immersive. I constantly find myself fearing to leave the island, as to have to face the endless ocean. Even when you have an island set in mind for paddling to, the wild life in the ocean under you can easily startle you. Not to mention sharks will occasionally draw an interest into the large banana colored life raft, almost non-effortlessly rising the tentions. When it comes to just surviving however, it's a rather different experience. When you first arrive on an island, the player can have any number of goals flash into their mind when they just see what in front of them. The player may see coconuts and crab and immediately start prioritising getting food and water. Or they may take more of an interest in the rocks and sticks laying around and may decide that making a shelter is the best way to go. It's always up to the player, and the consequences to the player are always from the players own choices. (Not counting bugs that cause a cheated death.) The crafting in this game was a very fresh experience for me. The system makes for a different feel than with a crafting menu, seeing as instead of making the item in your menu, you're making it right in front of your character. It's an idea I find is executed very well, as you have a very limited number of inventory spaces, and having to fumble around with items in a menu could cause for a very annoying or frusturating experience.\n\nPhysics:\nThe physics in this game are a mixed bag in almost every sense of the word. While some things are realistic, in the case of throwing around items and moving things around, or cutting down trees, others are far from it. A prime example of this is the life raft. Once you put more than a few items in it, it sinks. While this could be made realistic, this is far from so seeing as the raft looks like it's meant for 4+ people. Not to mention that, things like duct tape don't even drop into the life raft, they simply float above it as if there was a piece of ply wood rested over the top. The final problem I have with the physics are how items can react with others. When you drag an item against another item, as you'd imagine, it'd push it along. This is true for Stranded Deep, but it doesn't seem to matter the size, or the weight of the item in question. The most note worthy example I can think of is the glitch that can be preformed with the life raft and almost any object. You jump inside and shove the item against the raft, and the raft will begin to push very quickly in the pushed direction, much faster than the game's raft with a motor.\n\nAI:\n\nThe AI in this game is almost astonishing with how in-depth it can be, mainly for the sharks. Each of the three shark types have its own behavior and little quarks about them. For example, if you have yet to aggrevate a Tiger shark, you can sometimes get it to keep its distance just by locking eyes with it. ( Keeping your crosshair over the shark's head. ) While the Blacktip Reef shark is passive, being scared away by coming too close, or even by acting aggressively toward it. The fish's AI are pretty good too, seeing as they rarely swim away from the school and prefer to keep their distance from the player.\n\nOverall, this game was in almost no way a disappointment to me. I feel like I got much more than my money's worth for $15, and would have honestly paid another $5 to $10. The game is still in Early Access however, so bugs and glitches are to be expected. For me at least, any fatel ones have never really happened, and the only bugs and glitches I've ran into are minor at best, and only really break the immersion. If you're a die hard fan for PVE survival games, then you'll definitely want to pick this up. But if not, it may be best to either wait for a few more updates to come out, or even the official release, seeing as there isn't much to do besides survive and explore.\n\n9/10","April 9, 2015","true","29.8"," 73 of 82 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","73","82","4","0"

For me this was probably the biggest drawcard. It had a really nice smooth tropical look, stunning colors that changed with the weather or time of day. Gone are the relaxing doldrums, all you get now is endless waves, less realism, poor performance and the water glitches with tearing. The program now uses the Ceto water asset from the Unity asset store, which is nice if you're making a submarine or ship simulator, but up close it fails to impress.\n\nThe screenshots above still show the original water!\n\nOther issues that compel me to not recommend this game are:\n1. I can't alt tab out of the program and get back into it.\n2. 50% of the time it fails to start at all and I have to use the task manager to kill the process and try again.\n3. The crafting is now GUI based which ruins the immersion, it's like ordering from a mail catalogue.\n4. I can no longer cut down trees which is bizarre enough but we also used them to climb into boats that were inaccessable.\n\nI remember spending hours swimming between islands, risking sharks and starvation, just to gather enough wood to make a simple foundation. Often deliberating whether or not to take my lighter with me so I could carry an extra four pieces of wood. Now I go to two islands where I find enough tin, wood and steel to build a hut instantly. I'm still trying to work out how steel washes up on a beach.\n\nThe fact is that this is not the game I originally agreed to purchase at all!\n\n","January 12","false","58.1"," 108 of 136 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","108","136","3","4"

The whole look and feel are great. The atmosphere is "alive" and it really sucks you into the game. At the moment the game is still pretty buggy and I've used many four letter words while playing (especially whenever my raft just disappeared and i was lost at sea and surrounded by sharks), but that's just what you have to live with when playing alpha.\n\nWhat I like:\n- The atmosphere: I really feels like "Cast Away" or something like that.\n- The freedom: You can travel, build a camp, hunt, craft, and so on. Do whatever you like, just don't forget to eat and drink.\n- The crafting system: it still has its issues (stuff lying closely together can make things being involved that you didn't want to get involved) but i like the general idea of this system.\n\n\nFew things I would like to see changed / updatet:\n- More rocks. Damn, sometimes i had to travel to 5 islands before i had enough rock for a fire pit and an axe! That's really annoying since the islands are usually 3-5 minutes of boring RMB-pressing apart.\n- The islands. They look very nice, yes. I only hope there are going to be more different types of them and also really big islands.\n- More things to craft. A house boat would be nice. Or if one could place the bed *inside* the hut. How about an engine for a boat and more boat types and not just rafts?\n- How about finding stuff on the beach?\n\nGenerally I really like this game and again, I think it has great potential. Since it's only in alpha atm, there is still a long way to go and i hope we will get some updates soon.\n","January 25, 2015","true","24.6"," 59 of 63 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","59","63","4","0"

I love the idea here, and the direction it's going. For that genuine deserted island survival experience you just can't beat Stranded Deep. The audio is masterful and immersive, very realistic, with the occasional chords of music at appropriate times. The lighting from the upgraded engine makes for the most beautiful sunsets and the most realistic water I've seen. Seldom have I felt more dread in a game than when diving out on a beautiful, sunlit reef when it suddenly drops out, and at your back is nothing but the black darkness of the deep ocean... you see the flicker of a huge dorsal fin out of the corner of your eye and hear the chords of music that let you know... you are being hunted. These features, combined with the survival and crafting elements, and a map editor that allows you to create your own custom world space, make for a truly immersive survival experience.\n\nSome very minor improvements that I would like to see, to improve immersion: A chair to just sit in, by the fire, and watch the sun set or the moon rise. The ability to make time pass in real time. The sound of rain falling should reflect the type of roof it is falling on when inside a shelter. Caves. Fishing (there is spear fishing, but bait and tackle fishing would really be an impressive feature). An ultimate end-goal, or a story campaign, would be nice, but not necessary for the experience.\n\nI've been checking in with the state of the game every couple weeks or so, and I can say that it is progressing and growing. Regardless of some of the negative reviews, the devs really are listening to the community and doing their best to please everyone, often straying from their original vision to appease people. It seems the devs are learning some key attributes of almost any online community:\n\n1) Generally, many people are the most vocal when they have something negative to say. Conversely, those that are pleased often say nothing.\n\n2) You can't possibly please everyone.\n\nA good example of these things is the history of the crafting system in Stranded Deep. In earlier builds the crafting system was intuitive and had no actual in-game guide to tell you that a stick + a rock + some lashing = a crude hammer. You had to figure it out, and there was some satisfaction in that. And I found it more realistic. After all, why would our plane-crash survivor just happen to have the Webelos Field Guide To Deserted Island Survival in his back pocket? Despite the fact that there were numerous guides on the community hub, with all the recipes spelled out, many people found this crafting system too difficult to understand and demanded an in-game guide a'la other survival games. So it was done. But now all the people who liked the previous system, but said nothing, are loudly vocalizing their disapproval of the new system. Even evoking maudlin hyperbole that the game is ruined, the devs betrayed them, they have lost their way and sold out... etc. ad nauseum. (I should say here that I like different aspects of both the old and the new crafting systems. It is a means to an end, and not a make-it-or-break-it feature of the game.) So hopefully, lesson 1 and 2 here have been learned and the devs will remain faithful to what makes a game great; when the devs truly believe in it, and they make a game that they themselves would enjoy. You will never please everyone, but if, at the end of the day, you have remained true to yourself, you will have truly achieved something worthwhile.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=603679541","January 18","true","55.3"," 144 of 196 people (73%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","73","144","196","11","17"

It's just not as good as it could be. For instance, the size and layout of islands is one of these factors, there is simply no variation in this regard, I'm sure it couldn't be too hard to implement islands with varying 'biome' types with varying size and height into island generation but what do I know. And atleast add a story or missions to work on... it'd be nice if you could escape the islands! What is the point of trying to survive if there are no aims or goals, sure you can explore the wreckages and islands but even then that becomes a chore because they're far too frequent and far too similar, the experience of exploring them rarely differs. Building a stick hut and eating crabs every meal of the day is where the game ended for me.\n\nConsidering games that are already out offering a similar (and better) experience e.g. Subnautica, Salt, The Forest, the developers really need to sort out the issues that stop this game from achieving its full potential.

True survival guide book for the game that can be referenced -\n\n1. Sometimes it rains without a cloud in the sky.\n2. I can still hear the campfire while underwater.\n3. The raft, when I have to travel to another island to gather supplies, I cannot stock up the raft to bring them back to my base, the raft will sink, and even carrying a few items, they will fall out while paddling.\n4. With flippers on, the speed at which I swim is extremely fast.\n5. Its too easy to survive, I love that this game would be more of a survival simulator, which I think is what you intend. It is supposed to be hard, difficult, strategy and takes more thought. Make getting fish harder, food more difficult. And water. You can be unique in this genre, a survival simulator, not a survival game, many will flock to this.\n6. When a storm arrives or hurricane for example, there should be waves, swells, harsh seas. Difficult to go out in to.\n7. Bigger islands of course.\n8. More items and buildings to craft.\n9. Spear fishing should be much more difficult, and have an easier option with crafting a fishing pole to fish as well.\n10. I get hungry all the time way to quick, while it seems I rarely have to drink, it should be the opposite!!! you need water more so than food.. this is a no brainer.\n\nSumming up, survival is a constant struggle, not dying every 24 hours, manageable, but right now is way too easy. The effects, graphics and feeling is awesome, and I do hope that you keep the game true to survival, accurate and add or take away what you need to make it a pure survival simulator that can be played for hours on end with always having something to do, that never gets old.\nGreat game, but a lot that needs to be done yet, as of now, 8/10   Can easily be 10/10 if it goes in the right direction.","June 8, 2015","true","4.6"," 65 of 79 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","65","79","3","2"

Experience terrifying encounters both above and below an endless environment. Come face to face with some of the most life threatening scenarios that will result in a different experience each time you play.\n\nStranded Deep is one of the unique survival games on Steam.\nYou play as the role of a castaway stuck in the void of Pacific ocean.\n\nGameplay: Since every island has limited resources, you'll find yourself constantly wandering around the vast open ocean to find another island with yet another scarce resources.\nThere are three ways in which you can travel from island to island: Swimming, paddling, and using a motor boat.\nNot to mention, sharks will occasionally draw an interest unto the player.\nYou can do a lot of things on an island: Build simple structures, find/cook food, and sleep.\nIn the vast deep sea, you can: loot shipwrecks, and hunt fish/shark for food.\nThe crafting in this game is very unique compared to other games; You craft materials in front of you instead of the traditional craft-it-in-your-inventory/backpack.\nYou need to watch out for three things: Your Health, Hunger, and Thirst.\nEverything that you do is a necessity for survival.\n\nGraphics: The graphics of this game is breathtaking. The water's effects are some of the best I've seen. Seeing water quality in other games is rarely done. In fact, they do not act like water at all. This game is an exception to that; moreover, this is an Indie game.\nThe islands are filled with flora elements which makes up the beautiful island scenery.\nThe water world is also perfect.\nYou'll see tons of detailed biomes and aquatic fauna.\nThe only disturbing thing to see in the game is when the player is poisoned and your flashlight/torch is opened. This gives me goosebumps whenever I see this.\nIn conclusion, The graphics is superior in proportion to the file size of the game.\n\nPhysics: Throwing things around and cutting trees are the most realistic scenarios I can think of.\nThere are many flaws in the Physics of the game: •Raft sinking in the presence of light objects, •You can climb a tree while chopping it down, •You can chop a tree while freely walking afar from it, •Swimming is faster than paddling, •You can use a tree as a raft, • and many more...\n\nAI: Most of the fish travels in schools.\nThe three types of sharks has their own attitude towards the player.\nGreat AI script.\n\nThere are still a lot of bugs and glitches present in the game since it is still on Alpha stage.\nI would gladly share how to reproduce those bugs and glitches, Just message me.\n\nStranded Deep is an extremely promising Early Access Game!\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nDisclaimer: Everything is purely based on my opinion.\nThanks for reading!~","April 20, 2015","true","53.2"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","40","42","4","1"

It's just that the devs haven't taken advantage over it. I bought this game about 2 weeks after it was released into early access. At the time I thought to myself, "Wow, I can't wait for them to start expanding on this game!". Still waiting... Some people would argue that they have expanded on it. Sure, it's had bug fixes that fix about 2 at a time per week (Bug fixes like "fixed walking up steps"), which i guess is called "expanding the game".\nThe only significant additions that I've noticed when I played after many "updates" were singrays, oil rigs, turtles, and smaller sharks. (Over about 6 months of updates). The concept is great, it's just that the additions being added are coming out like the dev team is only one person.\n\nDon't buy at the state or price that this game is in right now, there are many more Early-Access games out there that are worth your money that are of a similar genre and have much more content.

Already impressed with how well things are working, granted, there are bugs, but at this early stage I'm impressed at how well things are being handled.\n\nBest way to summarize it all:\nYou will feel like Tom Hanks in the movie Cast Away.\nPerhaps you will find your Wilson if you are lucky.\n10/10 would lose Wilson again.\n\nWe can expect lots of additions such as greater landscape variations, more flora and fauna and more things to make. As it stands now I would say it's rather on the easy side seeing as every island is pretty much the same (survivalwise) and you have everything you need to live indefinetely on your island unless you decide to eat cooked food in which case you will be making many trips for wood on neighboring islands.\n\nI am very impressed at the game's current standing but cannot wait to see how it will develop.\nWhat follows are my thoughts on "the bad" and how I hope it develops.\n\n\n\nAt the moment as things stand, islands and world are somewhat monotonous.\n\n1. Everywhere you look in the ocean you can see many small islands.\n\n2. One major flaw I find is that from a distance (i.e. not  are directly in front), islands look exactly the same. Look carefully and you will see that such is the case, it is a generic image. This makes it hard to "judge" islands or get your bearings.\n\n3. Apart from aesthetics, islands are the same. Numbers may vary slightly but you will always find the following (of use) on an island: some sticks and stones lying around, some palm trees and a few yucca and potato plants. Optionally you may find some loot on ship wrecks (I have found them to be unnecessary for survival except for perhaps the compass). On top of all, roughly speaking, islands are same size.\n\n\n\n\nThere are of course many things that need fixing and that is normal, it is unfinished and still in the making. None, some, or maybe all of things we come up with are planned for later updates. Nevertheless, here are some points I would personally like added in future regarding island structure/build:\n\n1. Size variation, larger islands in general. More random, sometimes I want to be drifting in front of the smallest patch of volcanic rock and other times I'd like to see a sizable island as seen on "Cast Away".\n\n2. More varied landscape. Show me dangerous cliff edges with a surf that will puncture your life boat on the cliff rocks. Better hope you find some wood for a raft. Most small islands appear due to previous volcanic activity so perhaps more pronounced rocky hills perhaps some small caves (just like in Tom Hank's island in Cast Away) to act as a shelter from heavy rains and winds.\nMore potential variety due to previous volcanic activity: small tunnels from previous lava flow, potential black shore sands, barren landscapes (but lush and fertile on others due to increased mineral content) with only the toughest survivors like iguanas, lava lizards (and other species), geckos and snakes. [# Note: I don't want to mention too much about wildlife as I am certain more will be added as well as flora]\n\n4. Reduce island count, increase distance. Increased island size should help with this but I don't like waking up every day and paddling to the neighboring islands for wood every day. I want the open water experience to be more thrilling and dangerous. I want to be able to pack a raft with resources to survive my hopefully-not-too-long journey without seeing all those small puny islands all over the place. Make me risk everything on the open waters for a chance at a new, hopefully more bountiful home.\n\n5. Lacking resources, more challenging. This is how we get by the seemingly easy opportunity of the large island mentioned before. Truly randomize resources. Larger islands may be great for building materials and firewood but could be completely lacking in yucca plants, potato plants or other future resources. This may prevent you from building/crafting certain things forcing you to survive on a different diet and to eventually move.\nYou start with a KNIFE, the ability to make FIRE and a LIFE-BOAT.\nI want my stranded life boat to look like a swimming pool when it rains so that I may temporarily survive a barren landscape along with a raw fish diet. Flip the lifeboat and give me shelter. Puncture it on the reef or cliff edge and better hope I have access to water and shelter (I could make myself a raincoat or a makeshift sail out of the punctured materials though).\n\n\n\nThose are my thoughts on "island structure/build". Right now I can survive indefinitely on my island on potatoes which regrow in < 2 mins real-life-time and drink from my stash of coconuts which regrow anyways. I don't chop down a single palm tree on my island so I have the largest coconut farm possible. I have all I need to survive. As long as I have a rock shard (doesn't get damaged) I don't even need tools.\nOf course this will all change in future. I think the first resource that needs to be addressed is water. One should praise the heavens when it rains and are able to collect vital water for the upcoming days.\nIncrease difficulty over time by using seasonal changes; reducing chance of rainfall (and thus your ability to collect enough drinkable water) or highly increased rainfall, dropping temperatures, maritime conditions, and making life miserable on other fronts.\n\nCan't wait to see what this game has in store for us in the future.","January 30, 2015","true","17.8"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","40","43","2","1"

It's definitely a good looking, one of the best lookers out there. It plays good with simple controls, nice fluid UI, and a nice new form to craft where you drop your items on the ground, and then you will have a menu show up that will give you option on what you can craft depending on what you're holding in your hand, and what you have on the ground, and that's kind of neat.\n\nCrafting items is easy, and so is collecting them is, by picking up rocks, sticks, leafs..etc. About build a shelter, it's sort of like the game called 'Unturned' where you have to make a foundation, supporters, walls, and then a roof. You can put stairs too if you want.\n\nThe sailing from one island to another is neat, it's functional, but still needs a lot of work and hopefully more variation in terms of what you can ride on, like build an actual boat or something. This area could definitely use improvements, comparing it to another game called 'Salt' which I consider an expert in terms of sailing and exploration.\n\nDiving, hunting crabs and fish with your spear, and if you want go ahead and attack a shark. Speaking of sharks, they're not as threatening as I thought them out to be, you sail from one island to another, if you keep going they don't attack, if you stand still on your boat you still don't get attacked, if you go and take a swim they don't attack unless they're behind you only, and do little damage as far as my experience went, heck I attacked them and tried to hunt them down, they ran away which was funny.\n\nThe game is fun, it needs a lot of work, but simple yet complicated, natural survival games are fun, especially if they look good, intuitive, and sail. Going back to a comparison between Stranded Deep and The Forest, aside from their different direction they're going for, The Forest has more work put into it in terms of immersion with it's animations, graphics, and it has more charm and life, and if Stranded Deep wants to push on immersion, it should definitely look at The Forest, and in terms of fun, intuitive sailing experience, and island generation variety, they should take a look at Salt.

Also, had sharks beeline for me while I was in ankle deep water, clip into the ground, grab me and drag me unde rthe island only o let go, and I ended up drowning because I ended up stuck half in the ground underwater with no way to fix the situation.\n\n9/10","May 8, 2015","true","51.2"," 46 of 56 people (82%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","82","46","56","37","0"

This choice isn't in any way saying that that concept is bad or the graphics aren't up to par. The start of this game is original, and looks great. You do feel stranded, isolated and helpless at first. The diving and scavaging underwater is fun for a bit, and the presence of sharks are noticable.\n\nStill, with all that this game is in need of some major overhaul. Alot of buggy moments, and frustration comes non stop. Carfting system tried to be innovative but in the end is tedious and not well planned. The inventory space is very aggrivating, and backed up by the bugs from attempting to put things into your raft, it's just to much of a time sink. It could almost be considered tolerable except for what I personally feel is the biggest turn off for this game. Every island looks the same from a distance, with no depth perception. They all look _exactly_ alike when on the horizon. Losing reference from where you are going or been is a 100% chance. You think "Yea, well I can keep my bearing straight ahead". Works until the shark bumps you and you spin, or you try to get back to your island.\n\nGreat concept, but this game needs to be looked at closer for those things that make the game frustrating, not a challenge. No body wants to lose their progress because of ill conceived graphical rendering. Not even worried about the acheivements completely broken","October 23, 2015","false","7.3"," 60 of 79 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","60","79","5","0"

That Does not mean it's a bad thing!, Objective of the game is to survive out in the deep oceans ( No idea what region ) You can chop down trees, search the deep blue, go fishing and a lot MORE!\n\nAbout Developers Beam Team is made up of 2 Developers they are both in Australia ( Yay, First Game I know made my Aussies ) This is their first game as far as I know.\n\nStoryGame Beginning Spoiler! You Start off in a Private jet on the way to an unknown country on the way you make and light your 'Drink' after you go back and sit down your plane's door explodes and the plane goes into a nose dive before hitting the screen goes blank. You Wake up in the plane and it's filling up with water fast you have to swim through the hole in the plane up to the ocean surface and get into the Raft, Then the engine explodes you again get knocked out.... You End up waking up on your raft near a island. My Score for Story ( 7/10 )\n\nGamePlayIn this new survival game you must gather Wood, Food, Meds and Water to survive but It's not that simple you have sharks around islands and the ocean and they are not Happy Chappies, They will kill you no matter what you try to do. To Get the best loot you need to go in the deep blue, find ship wrecks and loot em. My Score on Gameplay ( 8/10 )\n\nGraphicsThis was the buying point for me, the pictures looked SO Amazing of corse that's on max and for that you need a beast PC, But my PC is kinnda good / Beast ( i7 3630QM 2.4Ghz-3,4Ghz, GTX 670M 3 GB and 12 GB Of RAM ) I get mostly 30+ FPS on Ultra 1920x1080p ( AA on SMAA ) but I do get drops to 25 FPS sometimes but that's expected, come on guys alpha give it a chance! :P. My Score On Graphics ( 10/10 )\n\nFetures in the game at the current stage are\nHouse Construction\nSpear Fishing\nBasic Tools ( Hammer, Axe, Knife and spears )\nInfinite procedurally generated terrain and biomes\nEndless underwater environments\nIn game achievements, unlockables, statistics and rewards, ( In Game Achievements are not working currently )\nRuns well on most Computers!\nAnd finally Amazing graphics, shadows and textures!\nConclusion To me this game is amazing the graphics are Top Notch The gameplay is fun and the fear sharks makes me keep coming back to this game time 'n' time again. This Game in my opinion is definitely worth the $14.99 even in it's current stage! and it's First day Release version!, Not gonna Give a final score for this game it's only alpha.\n\nThanks for Reading, If your getting this game hope you enjoy! :)\n-Goldenhawk\n\nSpecs used to run the game.\nBrand - Asus G75VW\nCPU - i7 3630QM 2.4-3.4Ghz\nGPU - GTX 670M 3 GB\nRAM - 12 GB\nHDD - 750 GB\nOS - Windows 8.1 64 Bit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","January 24, 2015","true","22.5"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","32","34","2","0"

I have yet to come across the shark clipped into the island bug, but trying to dive into deep water without a flashlight is kind of frustrating. I really look forward to the new features and new updates but as the game sits, it's a great way to kill some time in a truly beautiful(though sometimes full of deja-vu) environment.\n\nMy only real complaint, is that you can live, 100% off coconuts. You don't need to hunt crab, you don't need to fish. You can drink the coconuts for hydration, you can then crack the coconuts in two for food, and having full health/hydration will raise your health(in most situations at least).\n\nOverall this game is a great play, and also has a lot of potential to become so much more. It doesn't need cannibals, zombies or outlandish enemies to fight, staying alive (without coconuts) can be a struggle all in itself.","January 27, 2015","true","5.2"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","88","36","41","16","0"

But now after few updates i can't recommend it any more. Before this game had peaceful and beautiful sea, now they added bigger waves. Islands were before smaller and there was a lot of them, now there is less islands and them are much bigger that makes game easier when you don't have to travel from island to island much. In older versions there were too a intro where you crashed to ocean with plane and had to swim to life raft from sunken plane. Game has changed much. Before it worked in my pc very smooth at ultra but now it lags too much at medium. I have really enjoyed older versions of this game.

Found a raft.. lost my paddle.. Found another paddle, binoculars that don't work well and a flashlight. Killed by a shark, dang thing dragged me out deep, too.. Figured out shift helps me run faster (and swim faster).. Realized goggles and flippers are the best thing eva! Now I swim to islands.. Realized once I reach an island that I need to throw a stick down facing the direction of my last island.  Rode in a wooden raft (spoiler alert: foundation laid in water) to the middle of the ocean to be thrown off.. Freaked out and swam for the nearest island.  Now my raft quietly floats in the middle of the ocean.. Wish I had enough wood to make rafts towalk to each island! Loving the doors but wish being inside would warm me up.  Those darn sharks got me again, then went under the island after the hotfix and update :( Killed one!! That *** is mine now, and was tasty.  (spoiler alert: figured out how to place foundations on each side of a fire and place a wooden raft atop to make a stove. I don't think this is off limits to mention. I LOVE the stove!!)  Wish I had the ability to make tables to put my new lantern on, and appliances for a "kitchen" and storage units, like chests or something. Will explore more soon to get more wood. Left two trees for coconuts, no chopping those down. Needed a lot of rocks.. had to go to several islands to get what I'd need to build my cottage. Saw one of those spikey fish FLYING!! It defied the laws of physics and went right over my head as I swam to another island. Killed a stingray but unsure what I can do with it, couldn't cut it so I threw it on my stove.. lol What's that even good for? Would make a nice cozy rug.. lol Got sick from a potato uncooked.. what??!! Now they are dangerous? Saw a turtle but didn't have the heart to try to kill him. Trying to take everything I find to one specific island.  Navigation is difficult..Inventory is limited.

This game is very dear to me, though I only recently bought it. Ever since its release last year, even before it got big I was watching the updates, reading forums, and watching playthroughs. The game is very creative and though a lot of people don't think so, has quite a lot of content. One of the things I like most about stranded deep is that every game is your story. Kind of hard to explain. Here are some current pros and cons\n\nPros\n-smooth gameplay\n-super good looking\n-very well optimized ( I run this game on a ati HD Radeon 6970 and i3 6100 with 60-80fps with all on ultra. Lag only when loading the next island)\n-you can find Wilson\n-gives me a comfortable feeling to play it\n-shArks are really really pants-wetting horrifying\n-you can build castles! On little tropical islands!\n-so many more\n-Yesssssss! Trees are back to chop!\n-My crabby little crab shells are alive again\n-food spoiling is kind of cool.\n-OMG OMG OMG the INTRO IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nCons\n\n-sharks are way way way to aggressive. BEAM team please give us back the old sharks\n-I haven't seen a Marlin. Ever.\n-I have found every part of a motor but the engine. I have searched literally every island on 2 maps\n-maps aren't infinite any more. Very sad.\n-there is an odd glitch were the normal and bump map of the ocean don't move but the color does.\n-more my own opinion... I liked the little close islands. The big far islands are... Odd.\n\nThanks beam team! There used to be a lot more cons but the frequent updated have done their work!","February 21","true","10.6"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","36","45","6","3"

You're a person who's survived a plane crash after 'crafting' a martini and your goal is to survive.  I found it immersing in a "what if this happened to me" sort of way, creating my own story as I try to survive.  Rather than playing out a story someone has made for you.  I'm sure its an early access thing and wasnt intended, but I still enjoyed it\n\nI hope this game gets finished.\n\nPS the sharks can be terrifying if you are caught off guard.","September 1, 2015","true","20.3"," 40 of 52 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","40","52","8","0"

You play as someone surviving a plane crash in the Pacific Ocean. You can paddle from island to island in your dinghy and explore or simply just build your own small camp on the first island you get to. In order to do this you'll need to build some basic tools of course, and naturally you will have to scavenge for food an water to stay alive.\n\nThere are also shipwrecks that you can swim to and dive to in order to get loot from which will hopefully aid in your survival. But watch out, the water may look gorgeous and be populated with all kinds of wildlife, but remember there are tiger sharks and great whites roaming around.\n\nThe environment and sun sky effects are gorgeous, the water/underwater is very nice too. It also rains, but i haven't seen or heard any thunder and lightining yet. But i'm hoping that some real storms can whip up eventually as the game gets developed more. The crafting is pretty basic for now, and a few things like campfires, tools and shelters can be constructed. Again i expect this to expand quite alot in the non too distant future. Not too many bugs to speak of to be honest, which is pretty refreshing for early access games. Bring on bigger islands with waterfalls and maybe more wildlife deer, boar, snakes etc...that would be great.\n\nAll in all for £11 this is a bargain, especially if you're into survival games without the zombies/mutants, it's just you against nature.","January 29, 2015","true","21.1"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","24","25","0","0"

I can easily recommend it to anyone who likes open world survival games with crafting elements, it's a lot of fun! I can't wait to see what is to come, I am hoping for some more aquatic life like jellyfish, dolphins, and maybe squid.\n\nI also feel easter eggs add a lot more playtime as people will search thoroughly for them, so it would be awesome to see more easter eggs like the UFO and Sea Mines. Possibly even a megalodon or a kraken, I mean how awesome would that be to see in the game? Also, more raft options such as a wooden raft with a sail so you don't need to constantly paddle, it would be awesome to incorporate realistic wind and weather effects to give you that "stranded on the ocean" feel to the game. As of now, it's just too easy to survive and have no real reason to put yourself at risk on long travels on the ocean.\n\nMy video of finding the UFO easter egg in a legit spawn area;\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJnv00aLjtM","May 6, 2015","true","58.9"," 39 of 51 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","39","51","3","1"

Added\nHammerhead sharks\nStingrays\nPufferfish\nIguanas\nBirds (Dont over-do them though *Cough* The Forest *Cough*)\nLobsters\nSpider Crabs\nThe list goes on and on but you get the idea\n\nIsland size:\nThe island sizes are simply too small, if there is to be ANY replayability to this there NEEDS to be the chances of large islands, not HUGE but a good deal larger than the max seems to be, one that could house a small farm on it, a house, a beach hut, a dock, and still some jungle/trees\nthis is a MUST for the replayability of this game\n\nShipwreck variation:\nPretty simple, the shipwrecks are cool, but get boring, there should be variation to them, old wooden ships such as galleons would make me REBUY this game at full price\nLarge liner ships would be interesting but not a necessity\nWW2 planes would be interesting (And could contain things such as hunting knifes, maybe even a rusted old handgun < might break the game idea so not needed)\nSmall airlines would be interesting to search too\n\nShark behavior, quantity, models, sound:\n\nNow i stuck this at the bottom at first, but im moving it because i feel its 100% my main issue with this game\nFor a start, i love sharks, and i love the idea of them in games, but they're always done wrong, and heres how.\n\nThe behavior, it kills me, seeing a tiger shark swim up to my face and swim away 300 times is game breaking, its dissapointing and ruins the encounter.\nAlong side the behavior issue, the idea that i could stab a shark to death before it would attempt to attack me is peculiar and a strange AI choice\n\nQuantity, in this again is silly, i love sharks being in the game, but should be ALOT less often, i dont want to see three sharks every time i walk close to the water, i'll stick my idea for how the animals in this should be right at the top so, see top for that (Or in theory you've already read it)\n\nModels, the models in game arent bad, but theyre not amazing, the sharks need a touch up, at the moment the Tiger is the well done one, and the Great White looks silly, its got a stubby face all of them are beefy and they're all the same small size, id rather see mixes, some small sharks, and then Whites that are huge, imagine seeing a white the size they can grow to be 'IRL' just gently gliding alongside your raft, and swimming away, THATS the shark encounters i want to see (yes i think they should also attack now and then too)\n\nSound, i play with music off, but every time theres a shark around the music changes, i do not like this at all, i end up looking to see where it was, id rather have no notice, turn to see one and have it scare the ♥♥♥♥♥ out of me like it would 'IRL'\nAlso, the fact that the sharks growl is laughable at best, they should make noise when breaching the water (fins coming out or them rearing out to bite ect)\nAnd maybe some underwater noise of them turning fast or such\n\n\nNo Content:\nAs it stands the game is in Early Access, so all things should consider that\nBut for purchasing it you have to consider that as it is, it feels very empty\n\nNo replayability:\nBug issues fixed soo this is void\n\nBugs:\nAll mentioned have been fixed\n\nNo promise of improvement:\nNow this ones a big one for me, and the reason its ultimately a 'No' on the recommendation, this game is clearly built off the idea of The forest (Again, not saying thats all in all a bad thing)\nBut it could be, the game has started out very similar, and for the forest, one of its plauging issues, is the updates, small, non issue fixing and infrequent, if this game has a similar update path as The Forest, it will not be worth the Early Access, and i would fully recommend that you purchase once its complete (Or close to)\n\n***BITS AND BOBS***\nJust a small section of things id like to see in game, but couldn't categorize\nFishing nets should be added\nAbility to create larger rafts, small boats even\nThe ability to build on shallow water, docks that extend out onto the ocean ect\nFarms and farming should be added\nThe ability to strap the knife to a stick\nFishing and Fishing rods should be added\nFull diving gear should be added, suit, mask, and large air tanks ect (I know theres small items of it but there should be more)\nBit of a weid idea but shark netting, like beaches have, basically you could surround an area of sea thats somewhat close to your island or seabed and small fish could get in but not larger, and perhaps sharks could damage it and try to get in so you would have to fix it\nHomemade markers (Bouys ect)\nEven if its just a coconut a stone and some rope, so you could mark a path in the ocean\nMaps, again, even if its just cutting into a leaf, so you could mark things out\nDiary+ Pencil, small but might be an interesting thing to write in now and then\nFurnace, make sand into glass kinda thing (because a glass bottom boat raft would be fab)\nCraftable items - Containers, bow, snorkel, torch (stick and cloth or such)\nBetter + bigger waves","January 24, 2015","false","12.6"," 643 of 1,083 people (59%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","59","643","1","54","62"

But simply put, the content has basically stayed the same, in terms of goals and amount to do. Unless you find alot of fun in holding W to go to other islands that are pretty much the same, and doing the same stuff (eating and drinking sim 2015-2016) then you wont enjoy this for much more than 4 or 5 hours. Now of course SOME people will, but many wont. The reviews clearly show this, before the major update in the fall, reviews were 80 to 90 percents. Now it sits at low 60s, and 70s. The updates add content, and usually remove content. To fix things, to re do things. Usually updates we dont want or need. Basically so far nothing really cool. They have plans for cool things, but i think the game will die out before then. Which is sad, because before this major update in the fall, the game was amazing.

It will most likely bite them in the end.\n\nHeres a list of some of the things that worked or were in the game before that update\nPaddle\nStarted with knife and water bottle as well as the lighter (might be removing lighter so you start with nothing)\nCrab traps, to catch crabs\nCooking worked (or at leat you could boil water and drink it, and a ding would sound when food and stuff was ready) Now you need like part of a coconut plus a bucket and or 2 buckets to boil water, takes a little too many resources but whatever\nWeather, now its all sunshine (for now, they took it out to fix the weather) before there was lightening, fog, those things\nAchievments never have and likely never will work\nWhen going under water, it looked like water, now it looks like the rendering is off and it looks like you can see the whole world (not always)\nThe flippers, and goggles worked (now only flippers and they dont work)\nMotors on rafts worked (now they are really wonky)\nWorld was unlimited, although it all looked about the same, small islands (now bigger cooler islands, at the cost of only a 5x5 grid map)\nFlare guns used to scare animals (now they dont)\nMany other things, but you get the idea\n\nAll of this, and all they added was alot of unrealistic items\n\nMan made metals for building (how did these all get here)\nSome items for cooking water and food (it worked fine before now it just takes more resources )\nSlightly better building, and a second option for shelter\nNew crafting menu (mixed bag)\nFarming (sometimes doesnt work)\nThats it, no new items really. No new mechanics pretty much, no new content, no new nothing, over the course of over a year of development.\n\nIt used to be immersive and i l loved to play it\nNow it feels non immersive less gritty dark survival and feels more easy and simple","August 17, 2015","false","30.4"," 60 of 88 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","60","88","2","21"

When you learn how to survive, hunt, gather food, build etc. I would never thought that building a shack will make me so enthusiastic. However, after some time you get bored. Don't get me wrong, the idea, graphics and gameplay are awesome. The problem is the content or rather lack of it.

The team still trudges on, and the game has truly evolved.. slow but steady over the course..\nI DO NOT play it alot in sittings still, as even now there is just not that much meat and potatoes wise to hold you if your actually after what the selling point has been.. survival Castaway style...\nNO, NO.. SD currently, and most likely even in the end will now be a new category of game.. The Casual Gamers, No Problem, No Stress Survival, Non Survival Game\nDO NOT get me wrong.. it IS a good idea, it IS a neat little game.. but unless you just want to build rafts, look for engine parts and build beach houses just to do it.. it has little else to offer.\nRECENTLY the devs updated a few things.. to balance it out.. and it sounded great from a survival type aspect.. no saving without a shelter / bed save point ( you dont have to sleep, you just need the save location to save ) But you do need sleep in game.. Thirst was tweaked to be a bit more realistic.. you now need more fluid intake... much more than food.. which is perfectly sensible..\nAND they took out your starter water bottle and pocket knife.. AND no more boiling a bucket of seawater to get fresh clean water.. YES!!! Now you work for it!!!\n\nBUT NO.. They took that stuff out.. added some great and creative ( and realistic ) ways to get liquid.. then littered the beaches with buckets.. Within 10 mins of starting a new game.. I was armed with 2 buckets to create a rainwater catch / still... then another bucket to just sit on my porch and collect water..\n\nKind of defeats the purpose....\n\nMoot anyway since Death is NO FEAR.. it truly truly kills me each time I play that death is meaningless.. First.. you cant die unless you do it.. minus bleeding to death from a shark attack and not having a bandage. or having duct tap and cloth to craft one.. you will eventually bleed to death..\nOTHERWISE no worries... you can scrub save / load all day and night..\nOther than filling your bucket and shaking the seas weather has no point..\nOnly your tools wear out from use.. no worry over shelters or clothing..\nFood spoils.. big deal.. finding food is just as easy as ever..\n\nDO I still support this team?\nYES.\nDO I advise people looking for a survival game to play?\nNO. Not even if your looking for an easy intro to it.. Its not even a little bit about survival.\nDO I advise people to try it?\nYES. Do indeed.. it is a good play.. it just wont hold you for long unless your just looking to build.. but it IS evolving.\nI just dont think it will ever be a real game of castaway survival anymore.. but that.. is not a bad thing.. just a differnt idea.\n\n\nEDIT below*\nOh darn. No Perma Death. That kind of ruined it. But I do hope for a hardcore mode\nBUT:\nVery good Early Access. Not to many bugs I ve found, and easily avoidable.\nCrafting is a great new take on it.\nMost of the fun so far is figuring out how to craft.\nIts NOT an eating simulater. Have not gone hungry yet.\nFun stuff to do so far, and more to come.\nGraphics are nice.\nCrabs do seem to try and steal from you...\nSharks are not your friends..\nCONS:\nSaving on a beach or on a boat will spawn you under the item.. then you drown. Save on solid ground.\nNo key rebind working yet. ( No biggie to me, but some people dont like it )\nInsure your stockpile items are also on solid ground. Or they can fall in map.\n\nTotally good so far for a day one Early Access release.\n\nEDIT:* Fixes have solved most of the bugs. Still a few quirks, but no where near the original ones. Updated to allow more items, crafting and fix of an issue with a new item. Good job so far.\nEDIT** Addition of more items, crafting. Save issues worked. Raft now works as intended. SHARKS! Have been recalibrated so that they are a very large hazard.. BUT: They now are a bit more realistic in appearing. As in you can actually go in the water and not be eaten. Much rarer to show up, but when they do.. they are bad mutha's.","January 23, 2015","true","119.4"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","25","29","0","0"

I guess survival on a desert island in real life is not so much fun either.\nWhere the game gets really hard is when you take injury such as breaking an arm and being invited to dinner by a shark.\nThere is only one saved game at a time but you can restart in the same "world" multiple times or regenerate a new world randomly.\n\nSeems a lot of people want this as co-op or multiplayer, not sure I agree with that. Single player is hard, supposed to be hard and is enjoyable. I imagine in co-op mode people want to build stick cities and the like. Maybe once the world becomes bigger (or limitless) maybe co-op could make sense but a MMORG this is not.\n\nI do recommend this game, if for no other reason than to support the devs designing and delivering the last remaining peices; i.e. goals and aims, challenge scenarios and the likes. Because, at the moment, once you get about 15 days that's it, monotony sets in.\n\nTop Tip: unbind Q as the drop key if you are use to Q being rotate anti clockwise, the amount of items I lost before I did this (usually my compass and usually in the deep ocean).\n\nEnjoy and good luck avoiding the sharks","April 3","true","52.5"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","27","33","0","0"

Ive always had this dream and idea of being stranded on an island,  as long as it had an abundunce of food/water.   This game is great,  it sets the stage and kind of gives you that feeling of being stranded on an island.\n\nSome things that i would suggest for it ...\n\nMaybe instead of having islands always right at the crash site,  instead have the islands no-where to be seen,  and some of the game survival takes place in the Raft for a few days, or maybe even a week.  Collecting Rain out of the Rain pouch,  getting blown in a direction of islands. Maybe have a Raft that has the roof, and Heat becomes a problem. Maybe some type of option to fish for fish while on the raft .. and getting to an island is like a major releif when you finally arrive.  Maybe impliment starvation on the raft, dehydration on the raft.. sea sickness..  A storm,  blazing hot Sun.  Wind . Rain.   And when you find an island ... have leaving the island be a last resort.  Rather then how it is now where u just look around and another one appears .    Leaving the island, and literally having no idea where the next island is ...  and having to go back into survival on the raft until another island appears.\n\nbeing on the Raft should be some of the survival also.\n\nIt felt too convient that the islands are within 15 feet of the crash site,  And that any other island that you can paddle to  is within the clip plane.   It doesnt feel like im stranded on an island.  It feels like ive been dropped into a convient connection chain of islands that i just hop around to.   and the islands should be slightly bigger,  or have an option for a really big one in the midst of all the smaller ones.\n\nJust ideas","February 8, 2015","true","3.0"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","1"

It was the perfect type of game for me. When it came out I did not enjoy it as much as i thought i would. Don't get me wrong, I REALLY like the game, but I just can't bring myself to love it, and that's because of one thing.\n\nStranded deep is a very good early access game, it runs exetremely well, rarely crashes. It does have a substantial amount of bugs but most of these are just funny and do not take away from the game, and the bad ones are removed within one patch. The game looks amazing and is such a good idea, and now all the developers need to do is add more things to the game.\n\nAs of now, the game is very simple. You go from island to island, explore wrecks, collect loot, build bases, deal with wildlife, deal with weather, collect food & water and survive. This is exactly what the description of the finished game should be (plus escape back home, or any other cool things the developers can think of), it just needs to be fleshed out. There needs to be more types of everyhting. More wrecks (maybe even caves or other natural exploration areas), more loot, better base building, more (and interesting) wildlife, and in my opinion the most important of all: more types of islands, besides the generic, tiny palm tree islands. I would love to see tiny sandbars, or a massive jungled island, or a grassy island, or a large desert island.\n\nOverall, I would reccomend you this game the way i would reccommend any good (emphasise good) early access game.

Easy to survive with not many dangers or things to actually do. Buy if have an active imagination and can keep yourself amused, or wait until more content is added as this game has tonnes of potential... if completed.\n\nMy experience of the game has been mostly positive, it was stable and ran at a decent frame rate on my PC (Intel i7 4ghz nVidia GTX 780 16 gigs rame SSD) and gltitches were minimal really solid opening for a early access alpha.\n\nVisually the game is atmospheric with some especially noteworthy lighting, take particular note of the moonlight and sunset though sunrise did have some shadow flickering issues.\nThe islands are generic tropical but pleasing to the eye with some nice water effects, diving below the waterline was well implemented.\n\nControls and physics are reasonable, the movement can be clumsy at times especially near objects or climbing trees and moving about wrecks.\nObject physics are well implemented with some neat additions to manipulating in game objects in a reasonable fashion, it works much like how you would expect it in many cases.\n\nContent is currently rather limited, with very few craftable items and structures available and there really isnt a whole lot to do in the game currently, its up to you the player to amuse yourself in the game.\n\nChallenge is currently limited as well, as surviving is easy if somewhat tedious as crossing islands is long and dull but a reasonable expectation given the set piece of the game, and more content is forthcoming and should provide for more challenges to survivial.\n\nIn its current state this game is a well crafted and stable alpha that is fun to play initially and can amuse for a while, but will sooner rather than later show itself to be shallow and lacking.\nI would reccommend the game if you have an active imagination, would be happy to enjoy the visuals and pretend to be a castaway and set own goals to amuse yourself... I would not buy this title at the moment if you want action or a harsh survivial trial with goals and achievements to strive for.\nFor an Alpha its a very good start, has tonnes of potential but its early days and the developers will need to keep up the good work.","February 3, 2015","true","7.3"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

I'm still on my first playthrough!\n\n(Steam, why don't you record my ofline hours?)\n\nI set out yesterday to see/visit all of the remaining islands on my little map. At the end of what turned out to be a 13+ hour marathon session, I finally stood on the last of those quiet shores... but not before being poisoned by a lionfish (not to mention by my diet many, many times), trapped for half a day within sight of shore on an overturned raft by a hungry and aggressive tiger shark, had a broken arm from falling off a container ship, lost two compasses within 5 minutes of finding them (hours apart, and after much careful searching), been lost without food or water several times (until completing a physical map), and having been very nearly trapped to death inside the cargo hold of a derelict ship with no means to craft my way out of it. (Cooler heads prevail.) I have had so many really great moments, and I haven't yet seen all of what this early access simulator already has to offer. I look forward to the eventual end-game, etc etc, and will attempt to survive until the devs figure these things out. In the meantime, I will be expanding my farm, improving my island estate including docks and various watercraft, updating my map with shipwreck locations (boy I really wish I had managed to keep either of those compasses...) and coming up with more unique names for places as I think of them. Oh, and maybe hunting down that shark.\n\nTo say the least, this game is visually stunning and great fun to play. The wave physics are some of the most realistic I have ever encountered, giving the game a genuine feel of being out on/in the ocean. Combined with the lighting and level of detail (playing on Ultra _everything_, 90deg FOV @ 2715x1527), the surface/volume of the water looks authentic, too. The light of the torch reflects and refracts realistically, and weather affects everything as much as the time of day does, albeit more subtly. Crafting avoids tedium, the pace is right, the bugs (features?) that occasionally appear are in context and generally very avoidable if it feels game-breaking. I did not find any of these to be more excessive than what could be easily explained away by story context, and they have even led to some of the more exciting/tense moments in the game. This is also why I'm not sure if they are bugs or intended features since it all feels connected. Incidentally, I have avoided reading the wikis and watching vids. Nothing ever took me out of the experience, and if I get a chance to play this in VR: instant tropical adventure-vacation!","March 30","true","20.5"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

I have been in possession of this game for some number of months, and had admittedly played it for quite a while, then I had put it away when the Forest took my attention away from it for a while.  Now that it was back, however, I was eager to reinstall and get the game running again to experience the hopelessness of a Castaway-style adventure, only with the volleyball as a green coconut, and the name Wilson being replaced by Aidan.\n\nIt was when I installed and started the game, though that I realized that the game I was putting myself into was vastly different from the original early-access game I had come to know and love some months ago.  Looking over the reviews it appears that a relatively short while ago, but after I put the game down for a time, they went ahead and completely recreated the game in a new engine.  Now while this is not necessarily a bad thing, and I certainly think the new version is beautiful, it appears that this recreation meant a lot of the features and the tightness of the gameplay aspects I enjoyed are yet to be re-implemented in favor of a few new systems that seem a bit of a hodgepodge of features gleaned from other successful games.\n\nThat being said, I certainly think there were some improvements.  The graphics have improved without any significant detriment to performance, and some of the odd physics bugs I would normally see such as suspended items and the like are no longer there.  The crafting system is a little bit more intuitive, if horrifically incomplete so far, and parts and pieces can be assembled directly from the menus instead of having to place all the items on the ground to get the hammer to handle it.  Even the harvesting seems a bit easier, if changed, though differentiating between driftwood and not driftwood got a bit annoying, especially when it came to inventory management.\n\nAll in all, I feel like this has (and indeed always had) the solid foundation of a good game, and they had done an excellent job of building a solid game, then threw it all away to make it better.  However, it feels like it’s not quite where it was.  Hopefully, time will remedy this, and as they have proven before they can make a good game, I am cautiously optimistic about it.\n\nGame’s Fate: Kept around to play occasionally.  If they start restoring a lot of the features I miss, I may replace RUST with this\nBuy/No Buy: This one is a keeper, if anything for the promise, but if you already have a survival game or two, you may want to delay the purchase a bit and continue to entertain yourself with them.

The trip to the next island takes like, 10 real-life minutes and it's boring as hell. Also, the islands are all approximately equidistant from each other in a grid-like pattern, so it's very difficult to distinguish which island you came from after you're in the middle of the sea again.

This desert island survival game is fantastically beautiful and terrifically terrifying.  If the open sea makes you uneasy, buy this game and watch your fears come to life as a great white shark tries to bump you out of your raft into the abyssal depths of the sea.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful graphics, especially for an indie game.\n-Active devs, keeping up with the community.\n-Very few game-breaking bugs, none that I've seen myself.\n-Very immersive, with interesting stats/conditions mechanics.\n-Diverse and interesting marine biology, like the devs did their homework.\n\nCons:\n((Since it's in alpha, I really can't fault them for any of these.))\n-Not much to craft yet, but they're adding more with each update.\n-No rescue yet, but the items are there, such as flare guns and whistles\n-Very slow gethering process, takes about a couple minutes to turn a small tree into sticks and palm fronds.\n\n\nThe islands are randomly generated, so you won't fall into a routine aside from skipping the intro.  Your health, hunger, and thirst are on a survival smartwatch on your wrist, allowing you to keep track of your status as well as the temperature, time, and day survived. Your left arm is more than just a watch-holder, it gives you info on what condition your character is in at the moment. If you broke a bone from a shark or fall, your arm looks broken; if you got stung by a lionfish and got poisoned, you develop a rash and boils; cuts cause your arm to bleed, etc. There is no end to the game yet, but you don't really need one since the islands never end.  There are hidden goodies on the sea floor and I hope they add megafauna aside from the whale sometime (possibly giant squid?). I really cannot recommend this game enough, please support the developers and buy this game for full price.","February 15, 2015","true","10.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","16","18","4","0"

It's still very buggy, particularly when it comes to interacting with structures like rafts. Also, you tend to just die for no reason. I just gave up playing again, because my food rapidly depleted for what I can only say was no reason. I ended up dying a couple of seconds after my food bar depleted, yet in the previous game, I was bleeding to death after being bitten by a shark (why do bandages need duct tape?) and without health for several in game days before I popped my clogs.\n\nAnd the only reason I died in the second game was because you can't build a campfire on your raft's deck, even if it's made from scrap steel. The campfire placed about 4 feet off the deck, and made it impossible to balance a fish on it to cook it.\n\nAlso, with such a limited inventory, and no real way of transporting resources on your raft (because when you throw stuff on the deck, the boat tends to just glitch hard, and become impossible to sail), why isn't there some kind of craftable storage you could place on the deck of your raft?\n\nIf you're a super diehard fan of roguelike survival games, you might like this one. But I would have to say i can't recommend it in it's current state.

It also does not take alot to run this game i am playing it on high settings on a $300 hp laptop and it is very smooth.  One thing i do wish they would add is some wildlife on the island maybe some lyzards or snakes and a craftable blowgun and for sure if done right a fishing pole could be hours of fun and resourceful.

My one critic is that the actions become repetitive. You harvest wood, build a hut, eat, sleep. Wake up, harvest wood, add to your hut, eat, sleep. Wake up, travel to another island to harvest wood, add to your hut, eat, sleep. So I'd like to see an expansion to the crafting in terms of things that you can build. So far I've found a "Dead Ex" box, and a "landshark" sign. Which makes me think, "well, what if you can build shelves to store inventory or even able to hang my wonderful, "landshark" sign? How about a chair, or an improvised lamp?\n\nAlthough I understand that it's essentially a "survival" game, in reality, morale is also essential to survival. So perhaps you travel to a distant island and find a treasure map? Or parts of a treasure map that you have to peice together? It would definitely increase player moral and change up the repetitive and often, mundane task of wake up, eat some cooked crab, travel to an island to harvest wood, come back to home island, add to hut, sleep and repeat.\n\nBut with that said, I do recommend the game and I am still going strong in my support of this game.","March 29, 2015","true","41.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Also ive been running into a few tight spots, like running out of trees, and getting lost when exploring islands.

Exploring other islands and ship wrecks as sharks circle above.. or below you in the dark. Swimming in the ocean to far from your raft or life boat is pretty spooky and visually, it is quite stunning. The moon light is fantastic. The lighting overal is really nice.\n\nIt's a little rough. Some bugs like your boat suddenly vanishing and throwing you into shark infested water, but it isn't anything game breaking.

Yes, development is slow, being only two developers on staff but to all those reviewers complaining that there is little to do in the game and why isn't the game finished, well they should have researched the company before investing cash. This is an early access alpha game, it isn't even close to finished and won't be for a long time but without your investment these companies couldn't operate.

It feels like you are actually on a deserted island surrounded by bloodthirsty sharks. Unfortunately, you have to say hello to those sharks very early in the game. In fact, don't get attached to your beginning island, because in about 15 minutes after you start the game, you'll have figured out the entire LIMITED crafting system. But thats not the best part, the best part is when a shark gently bumps your raft as you're regrettably trudging from one island to the next, as you fly into the air, and the raft flies in the other direction. I didn't know sharks could do that.. Apart from some pretty serious glitches that haven't been adressed, the absolute worst part of  the game is the VERY limited amount of resources to work with. I think even Forest Gump had more trees to work with. WE NEED MORE STICKS DEVS. Thanks, and until then, ill be watching, but unfortunately, not playing.\n\nP.S. I do have to say.. diving and exploring underwater and trying to avoid death by shark is what makes the game. It is the absolute best and most thrilling experience the game has to offer. Go Devs on that. But seriously guys. Please more sticks.\n","October 30, 2015","false","26.1"," 40 of 64 people (63%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","63","40","64","19","4"

It was a lot of fun while I played it, but it definitely needs to be fleshed out further for me to continue playing.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful graphics! I love how realistic and gorgeous everything looks. It all really looks good!\n-Minimalist UI! - I love this! It really makes it more immersive.\n-Lots of fun! - I love crafting and building and exploring new islands and shipwrecks.\n-Stumbling across random new items in shipwrecks--it was always enjoyable discovering something I'd never found before. Each new item was delightful!\n-Realism - As mentioned above, I love all the effort put into making the game realistic and immersive! It was a pretty good balance between being realistic and still being fun (because, of course, being too realistic can make things become tedious).\n\nSuggestions:\n-Deterioration rate of needs didn't seem terribly balanced/realistic. I only had to sleep every 2-3 days (not at all realistic), and hunger was never a problem for me. All I ate was fruit (which I did mostly as another way to hydrate myself when I didn't have fresh water available and didn't want to waste a coconut). I never fished or cooked potatoes. I cooked one crab in the beginning before I realized I didn't need to cook/eat much. The only thing that seemed pretty accurate was the thirst deterioration, and that was (realistically) a pain to stay on top of. However, it could still be realistic but less bothersome if the passage of time were slowed down.\n-The Timescale - The days passed waaaay too quickly! I know a lot of people say that 1 second equalling 1 minute of gametime is pretty standard, but I could barely accomplish anything before the sun set. I know that's part of the challenge of it, but the current timescale is more frustrating than simply "challenging." I was only able to progress to the point that I did because I didn't have to sleep much (which, as I said, is not realistic), so I was able to work through the night many nights (which was a nuisance because I'd much rather work by daylight than headlamp).\n-Respawn rates - I tried to refrain from cutting down palm trees because coconuts are such a lifesaver and I wanted them to respawn, but in 22 days of survival they never respawned, so I guess I might as well have cut down the trees I was trying to save. Yukka plants seemed to respawn overly quickly (although maybe real life yukka plants grow really fast--I don't know). I never needed to worry about overdoing it on making lashings. Also I think it would be good if the ficus trees respawned (but slowly... like... 10 days after being cut? Maybe more?)\n--The seagulls and bats are a nice touch, but way too loud/noisy!\n--I would love the ability to make a map. On the one hand, I like how realistic it is that I have a hard time keeping track of what island is where--the realism is definitely good... but there must be some way to balance it so that it is realistic and challenging, but not overly frustrating. Although you know, I think a lot of my frustration at not remembering which island in the distance was which had to do with the days being so short. Because the days are so short, there's just no room for error in your navigation--you better know where you're heading and be super prepared for anything at all times (I carried around an emergency stash of 4 green coconuts just in case I ended up having to stay the night on an island I didn't mean to, and I wasn't always confident that that would be enough). Having to be prepared is good, but the constant struggle between need deterioration, losing daylight, and not having your bearings on directions and locations made gameplay borderline tedious at times. I would loved to have been able to loosen up a little and not worry so much. Obviously if you're stranded on an island you're going to be constantly preoccupied with survival, but this is a game, so I'd love to be able to lighten up a LITTLE bit more.\n\nOn the whole I think it is a wonderful game with loads of potential. Even as it currently is, it's a lot of fun, and I definitely recommend trying it out if you love realism-based exploration/survival games with beautiful graphics.","May 13","true","18.8"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","18","24","3","0"

I climb a tree and manage to gather enough coconuts to get my health stocked.\n\nDay 3: I build a small hut, then I see a shipwreck in the distance, with my last encounter with sharks I feel I can make this without too much problem, how wrong I was! half way to the shipwreck with no raft I suddenly realise I'm still bleeding from my last encounter and blood spots are forming in the water, I hear the terrifying music playing, I swim back to land quickly... a storm starts\n\nDay 4: just as the storm settles, I decide I have to see what is in that shipwreck, the water is strangely peaceful... I look up and see a plane travelling overhead, far in the sky... I wonder how I can possibly get it to see me, I feel lost and sad, but with a lovely sense of adventure somewhere amongst my feelings, I manage to gather the supplies from the ship and head back to land\n\nDay 5: is where I currently am.\n\nVerdict: This game is not like other games, most games teach you never to drop items or they despawn, but this game encourages it, it's got a real sense of survival and a satisfying crafting system.\nGraphics are pretty cool, not the best... a couple of terrain glitches, especially when underwater, its terrain can suddenly change, the water could be better too, fair enough it looks lovely but I would love some waves to maybe toss the raft around, best in a storm.\nGame mechanics work on common sense of real life, most things work as you would expect them to, you see blood in water? attracts sharks? maybe...\ndon't know the recipe for an axe? use common sense, most likely you'll find out easily, again with finding food/water and smashing coconuts.\nThe shark AI could be a little better, as of right now they feel a little easy to kill and dodge in the water.\n\nEven though I recommend this game, I advise you, if you like to get in game and have a near flawless experience, best leave buying this for now, as of right now (27/01/15) there are quite a few game breaking bugs, all have been reported and I'm sure the developers are working on them.\n\nso far I'm having a lot of fun.\nI'll keep this updated when more bug fixes come.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n\n\n","January 27, 2015","true","21.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Being alone out in the middle of the ocean and either great white sharks or tiger sharks advance within close proximity.

I am expecting great things from this game not only in maps but also in mods and content as time goes on.\n\nThe community you will find here are people who enjoy survival games that are deep rooted around crafting systems. The one thing that has impressed me so much about this game is the dev team. They go out of their way to make sure YOU get the content and features you want and are willing to come into the forums just to help you fix an issue. When you invest into this game you arent just investing into a game you investing into a group of friends and family that will try and make sure you have a good time playing the game.","December 16, 2015","true","153.8"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","18","25","0","2"

First off I believe this game runs off of Unreal 3 Engine, can't confirm this, given that some mechanics are similar to other U3 games, notably "Viscera Cleanup Crew", and "The Forest" runs off of the Unity engine, which these differacnes creates a drastically different game.... I tired of trying to clean this up, this game IS amazing!!!! I cant predict the future but this game has some amazing potential, and at its current build it is completly playable, if you die its your fault. I would recommend this game up and down, all day of the week 369 days of the year, hell I'd pay more than 14 USD for this. I don't beleive you can find a better game for that price.

(explained below).\n\n---------------\nMy Story:\n---------------\nDay 1: I woke up in a life raft and paddled to the nearest island. I searched everywhere and put all of my gathered stuff in one big pile. I made some tools a foundation and a camp fire to cook my crabs\n\nDay 2: I chopped all my trees down and can expand my home, survival look bleak, I then find a boat on the cost and find a machette! I gathered all of the resources onb the island and built my home (with a missing wall) and a bed. Night fell and my coconut collection was taking up and 3rd of the island and crabs where everywhere.\n\nDay 3: I rose after a night of cooking crabs and eating potatos and decided to paddle to the next nearest island. I packed all I could with room to spare for my quick trip. I set 'sail'.\n\nHalf way there I realised all the distant islands looked the same. But I though it was because it was alpha. Then my life raft teleported away and diapeared from sight.... I dove into the ocean too see if it sunk. but there was a ship wreak, I swam towards it and a tiger shark swam infront of me and I crapped my-self. I swam to the surface and realised this was my fate.\n\n*quits*\n\n---------------\n\nOverall the game is stunning and has potential. The crafting is really good and easy, which works well with the environment. As you can't plant more trees or 'sail' t another island the game only is short lived.\n\nCurrent - 7/10","January 24, 2015","true","8.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","13","16","4","0"

But in summary, it is really up to how much you are willing to pay for a game in early access, if you think it is a reasonable price to pay, go ahead, it goes towards the developer and goes to making it a better game.

This game is still in Early Access, so my review is only for the Early Access.\n\nStranded Deep is some other tittle for castaway/survival games. You are on the way to nowhere and your plane got crashed because something strange. Unless the other survival game that provide zombie, monster, or even wolf and ghost, this game is only have 1 trouble creature, Sharks. So what you have to do is simple, stay in some island and keep your distance for sea, quite easy right ?. Now you're hungry, thristy, and lonely, can you still stay in just one island ? and this is the point of the game.\n\nSome of bug happened :\n- When you save the game, and load it again, sometimes your screen will become black, or you glitched, you heard the sea sounds but your camera is stucked somewhere\n- Wooden boat/life raft is gone when shark attacked it, this is what i really dont like in the middle of the sea\n- Sometime the pedal doesnt work when clicked or while sharks attacking\n- When your backpak is full, and you trying to put something to the boat to carry it to home. Your boat or your item will gone\n\nWhat should be added (for dev) :\n- Should add mining axe, for an easy resource.\n- Make the little fish become  a thing that we can kill an eat\n- BOW and Arrows , i think its more fun if we have bow for kill the sharks.\n- Make the palm tree respawn\n- Something to distract the shark, maybe a decoy. ( well i dont know, it just on my mind)\n- BACKPACK, i dont like if i can only carry 8 things\n- Chicken, Birds or something else. and kill the birds with bow, that could be fun","February 21, 2015","true","11.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","15","20","5","3"

Im just not very good at it.\n\nAn amazing game, great graphics! I recomend high if you are on a desktop which has 4 ram or over. A great engine, if you have seen the film Cast Away this is a great game for you! As you would see £11 is quite alot for a game at this state, you cant do much in it, although they are updating this game frequantly. There will hopefully be an update every week or so. A few bugs and glitches, but some are kind of funny. In jacksepticeyes video's on this game he has a well known glitch, sharks swimming in land, I know this may seem like a serious glitch, its not, its just funny! I don't think the sharks can harm you when there swimming on land though, if they could, and they did, well, I wouldn't be so pleased. So far the creators of this game have done amazingly. I love he features this game has, im trying to make a base, so far I have only done the foundation, its hard to find all the materials, but its worth it. I strugle trying to put a bed in a place where I want it, I pick up the bed using right-click and when i try to move it, it goes all over the place, it goes upside down, i think they should make it easyier to move, i am really pleased with this game so far. I would recomend looking up videos on youtube about this to see if your sure that you want to get this game. If this revieiw helps you can you please rate it helpfull, thanks.

For a game in alpha it is very stable. I have not experienced a single crash yet. I run the game on the highest graphics settings and havin't noticed any FPS drops.\n\nExploring/Crafting/Hunting are what you will do most of the game. Pretty early on you will use up all the resources on your main island and need to venture out to the surrounding islands for supplies. There are ship recks you can find that will normally have loot which can be medicine, boat motor parts, tools, flares and a bunch more.\n\nTraveling between the islands is the real danger in this game. A sudden storm can make it very difficult to navigate and if you get lost it can be very difficult to find your main island again. There are also a lot of sharks around. Tiger sharks normally in the shallow areas and Great White sharks in the deeper waters.\n\nLike any alpha the game does have bugs but nothing game breaking. There has already been a hotfix that fixed alot of the issues people were experiencing at release.\n\nOverall I'v really enjoyed the game so far its got a lot of potential.","February 4, 2015","true","56.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

And I don't mean in the informal, overused form of the word. I mean, it really is awesome. It's still under development so it's glitchy as hell and a little rough, but even being so, the game looks nice. The scenery and graphics are really nice. But graphics is not the reason why you'll love this game.\n\nI will admit that the first 5 or 10 minutes (before I knew it was still under development) I was thinking, "what the hell is this, what a waste of my money". My opinion quickly changed as I played it and after a half hour I just couldn't stop. I installed it around 10 pm Saturday. Played it almost 20 hours straight and went to bed at 8 pm on Sunday. That doesn't speak wonders about my sanity, I know, but it does say something about the game. Its dynamics are incredibly catchy, and the story you start developing yourself in your own way quickly turns fascinating.\n\nAs I said it's still under development and it's still in a very early stage, but it's tremendously promising. I really can't wait to see where it goes and what's coming.\n\nI would highly recommend purchasing it now, and see it evolve as it develops further.","February 8","true","18.7"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

Updating to a newer version of Unity seemed to be the biggest step they made so far. a lot of promises and a lot of time has passed since i bought this game.\n\nTake an example of Ark, wich is in ea state too, but damn do you feel that they are really working on that title. This is even worst then the Progress of the DayZ standalone.\n\nPlus a lot of player are whing about coop, but for what for, to walk around for about 15 minutes without any content. Even the experimental version is , well just **** up. IMO those are just some beginners with an great Survival Concept idea, but not skilled at all.

You can control your exposure to these events, then return to your island to relax. This simulation of control may be very welcome to some.\n\n\nWith no hope of rescue, you will spend the later part of your time in the game exploring for the sake of having something to do.

Also there used to be more animations like drinking a coconut but now there is no animation. I love the new building system and rafts and everything really. I just dont like the minor bugs.

At first you think an update that means the game is improved and new stuff will be added.  Wrong about the improved part.  I don't know about the new stuff part because I can't even play it.  I can get to the launch page but when I click start game it just says loading.  So I thought ok it might take a bit becuase of the update.  I let it sit for 2 hours still said the same thing. Loading...\n\nI am not saying before the update it was perfect but I was better.  Sure the graphics were glitchy at times but it was better than not playing it.  And sure the game had other things wrong too.  Like a random boulder just appearing 3 days of being on the island.  It appeared in the middle of my house where my food and my flare gun were.  And then you had the shark becoming a land shark going though the island still killing you, and you not knowing where to swing your weapon.\n\nI was content with all of this because it was an early access game thinking it will get better.  But I was wrong that update sucked for me.  15 dollars down the drain.  Before the update I was telling my friends how fun it was and how the graphics were pretty good to me. (At the beginning I was just looking at every little detail becuase it was there.)  Now I am telling them how boring your loading page is and how the game was good.\n\nI would have recommended this game before the update but now I say it is not what it could be.  This game has a lot of potential.\n\nI will change my reveiw if the game starts to improve.","March 28","false","32.8"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","1"

I have ran into some bugs that make the sharks swim through land and your raft can randomly disappear but if you save often it isn't too bad considering it is alpha. The crafting system is pretty cool, though I am a little frustrated that I can't keep fires lit like in The Forest.\n\nThe farthest I have made it is 4 days and after the 3rd day I noticed other types of sharks and various sea life started appearing that didn't in the beginning. I really like how you have to pay attention to where you are taking your raft, because it is very VERY easy to get turned around and subsequently lost when you are out exploring. I find it easier to set out at either sunrise or sunset. Otherwise, you are going to have to put some effort and ingenuity into finding what direction you are heading. I usually hold my watch directly under the sun or moon and you can figure it out pretty well. This game was a dream game for me, as I played a LOT of Treasures of the Deep on playstation and I always wanted a game where I had to fight off sharks and survive in the ocean.\n\nIt is definitely not without bugs and flaws and people who don't like buggy Early Access probably won't be swayed by this, though in 4 hours of gameplay I have had zero CTDs. It obviously shares similarities with the Forest, but this game is very Jaws whereas The Forest is the Descent. It's basically going to come down to your taste in location. I personally love both games for similar reasons, and for what makes them different from one another. I am excited to see where this game can go.\n\n\nPS: The addition of multiplayer later in development is a good idea. Thinking of ramming other peoples rafts and letting them get attacked by sharks makes me laugh. Make it happen.","January 24, 2015","true","16.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

I want to make a suggestion, could you guys make it so you can custom build your own mobile boat house? This would be great considering you could bring all your items you've collected as you go exploring to far off islands.(plus a mobile boat house is just ♥♥♥♥ing awesome and something i've never seen in a game.) Also a boat house would be extremely useful because I feel very limited in where I go in the game because when I start building on a island I try to only go to islands near my island so I don't end up losing all my hard work. This makes it almost impossible in my mind to go any were even a little bit far from my island. I am aware there is a compass in the game but Ive never stumbled upon one, probably because its on a island ive never had the guts to venture off to. If I had a boat house I would never have this problem as I would just sail island to island with all the stuff ive spent multiple hours collecting by going into aboandoned boats and ♥♥♥♥.

The graphics are nice and smooth. At the beginning of the game, the atmosphere feels warm and sunny like a holiday in the Caribbean. Then there are the sharks, the poisoning and the starving. When your life stats monitor watch starts beeping and you see yourself running for a coconut like a mad monkey, then you wish you had saved your game recently. This is not the usual online "only the fittest survive" crafting game, as there is nobody to kill you. Only nature itself. Beyond that, there is not much to do yet. You are on your own. You gather, you craft, you sleep. The gameplay hence, still needs some work, but Stranded deep is still in early development. If you are a bit of a loner or you just want to spend some primeval, or shall I say"back to the roots" quality time, then this is the game to play. On a final note, imagine this game to be VR compatible, with all its atmosphere, the lonelyness, the peace and the forces of nature in a completely submersive experience.

This game is actually very fun. This game, originally called Malaysia AIrlines Simulator, is a spin-off of the popular franchise "FarSky", in which the player falls into the water and swims around a bunch. Unfortunately, Bethesda game studios filed a lawsuit, saying the game's name was too much like "Skyrim", and so the name was changed from "FarSky" to "FarCry", which is essentially what this game is. In this FarCry3 spinoff, you play the roll of a plane craash survivor somewhere in the pacififc ocean. Along the way, you will face real challenges, like figuring out how to craft, trying to find the knife or paddle you threw away, and fight Great White Sharks with a rock shard attached to  stick.\n\nIn my first day of playing, I lost my knife, fell out of a tree, tried to hit stuff with a rock (you can't), got my raft rammed by sharks, found a machete, almost drowned, killed a ton of crabs, lost my machete, and drowned.\n10/10\n\n","February 4, 2015","true","18.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","100","6","6","7","0"

I've played it for about 9 hours now, and I will list some things that I've noticed good and bad about the game!\n\nPROS:\n- Beautiful graphics, absolutely stunning.\n- Simple and easy to use controls\n- Minimal GUI and HUD to create a better immersion in the game\n- Adrenaline pumping when in the water surround by sharks\n- Interesting crafting system\n- The sharks aren't out to get you, but follow you around\n\nCONS:\n- There is no multiplayer, which in a game like this makes it very lonely\n- couple bugs here in there*\n- Not a ton of things to do besides explore and live as long as possible\n- Islands are waaaaay to far apart to travel between (needs a real boat or something)\n*A few bugs I came across were sharks swimming through land (they couldn't hit you but they could knock you around and it would scare you good), loading a saved game makes the life raft disappear (for me), and sometimes things disappearing when you leave an island to long, and some crafting bugs.\n\nI love this game besides it needing some work here and there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pheeo/recommended/313120/","Pheeo","Pheo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pheeo/","202 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEarly access is a tough one for me; the fact that developers get their end goal of income, yet the consumer gets a half-♥♥♥ game, doesn’t make much sense in my head. However, even with early access, Stranded Deep manages to deliver a lot of fun gameplay, showcasing a potentially terrific future.\n\nStranded Deep is a very ‘The Forest’-esque game, in which you survive a plane crash (never seen that before) and hop aboard a life raft into a randomly generated archipelago. Once landing onto shore, there are very limited resources upon your shockingly small new home. With only a paddle, a bottle of water, a pocket knife and a lighter to arm yourself with, you head out on an uncertain journey. As an early access build, the limit of different resources found on an island is around seven, but special items such as torches and axes can be found washed up on shore or in an underwater boat wreck.\n\nThere is no HUD on screen, so you might be wandering how you see your thirst, health and hunger? By holding the F key the player will raise their wrist, exposing a watch that displays the time alongside the other three key stats. All of this is very nicely textured, which is surprising considering the 400ish mb download size. Every animation that the player can conduct is smooth and accurate, and I was impressed by the detail at which some of the scenery was displayed; cutting trees in half to see the inner rings, for example.\n\nAfter a couple of hours I had made myself a simple shelter, put together by a great crafting system; throw items on the floor and see what happens, it’s that simple. Alongside this, I created a fire pit, bed and a huge pile of coconuts harvested from palm trees – not to mention the shark meat harvested from seemingly harmless sharks I had slaughtered. By this point the game felt as if there was not much else for me to do in this first public build.\n\nAs you’d expect, there are a few bugs which lie in this current version of the game. Sharks sometimes can’t harm you, not matter how close you get. The primary game breaking bug, which one of the two developers of the game has pointed out, is that when you travel to a new island you discover that whatever raft you take disappears when entering a new biome. A bit sad, especially when you’d already placed your favourite football companion, Wilson, on the raft – he actually exists as an easter egg. Who knows, perhaps Tom Hanks might make an appearance in an upcoming update, too. However, this is the first version of the game to be released for the public and bugs have to be taken with a pinch of salt.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTo conclude, this beautiful game is great for a couple of fun-filled hours, and a potential gem if the developers stick to it and play their cards right. The room for expansion for this title is endless. The roadmap of the future of the game lies on the Steam store page, featuring things like multiplayer, more wildlife and an end game scenario. Let’s hope to see updates soon, and happy exploring!","February 5, 2015","true","2.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Think Castaway: The Game.\n\nStranded Deep has a lot of promise especially coming from such a small dev team. Its as much relaxing as it is beautiful and has hours and hours of fun to be had even tho there isnt much to do in the games current state. The world is procedural generated so every play through will be different and you could get in your raft and paddle forever and the game will keep generating new biomes and islands as you go.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you have a big imagination and like survival games.

It is still in development, there are bugs and lags, it is constantly changing - sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.\n\nDifficulty Starvation and thirst are  usually  not a problem.\nThe difficulty otherwise varies. At the moment the sharks are not easily killed and with the new wave system, just paddling from one island to the other can be a pain and make you kind of sea sick (luckily they are close).

This game simulates the feeling of being lost in the Pacific whilst fighting for your life in a tropical setting of shipwrecks, and underwater adventure. This game can make you feel helpless, and challenge you to survive in many different ways.

The realistic approach failed this game by being a bit to real. I think it would of served this game better to take a better exploration approach instead. Its main flaw is the repetitive island task when you must move to another island were it is exactly the same, you chop wood, make a shelter get food, then you are out of resources then you move to another island and so on. The items you obtain are pretty usless and boring. Apart from the shipwrecks and areas you explore its all just boring wandering. And the shipwrecks and areas are pretty dull as well.\nA couple easy fixes to improve the game would be\n-Losing the one life cycle and have respawning because restarting the game is not a chalenging factor, its just boring\n-More inventory space\n-More things to do on an island\nSome good things about the game are\n-Interduction is cool\n-At times it can be a bit scary","October 5, 2015","false","1.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

The game plays at a very slow pace, but with intense atmosphere of keeping yourself together to stay alive: water, fire, wood... soon you'll have to find ways to economize and to take risks to keep the water processor going. Resources are scars (except for food), challenges are constant... Great game with a minimalistic approach.\n\nWhile I'm at it, I like to summarize some points that, to my opponion need some attention:\n- Yuka grow too fast, Ficus could maybe regrow slowly after many days\n- Many clipping issues, but non game breaking (as to now)\n- Building a house need more advantages (ex. shelter, storage, ...)\n- Naming discovered islands would be cool\n- Hunger is too easy to satisfy\n- Herbs for curing?\n- New driftwood and other junk after a storm (to keep exploring same islands interesting)?\n- No roofs on houses?\n- Nice would be some mysteries to solve (skeleton wit note, bottle with map, abandonned cabin,...)\n- Fruit could satisfy thirst slightly\n- Impossible to recuperate items from build constructions??? (ex. bucket)\n- Streamline the construction interface! (now it's click heavy)\n- Scenery and items are plopping into image too late when nearing an island (rocks, trees,...)\n- Sickness and injuries should restrict some actions (now it does not matter if one is ill or not)\n- A peronal story to keep the player going forward, pushin the limits,...\n-...\n\nBut I'm having a feast with this game.

I wouldn't conplain about the wait if the actual updates were noticable but to be honest they aren't, nothing substantial is really ever added withon a reasonable time frame. Now let me tell you a story of why i played this game as long as i did, sit down bouy's and gills and listen to my fin adventure. This all started with a very enjoyable item called the label maker, which those of you that dont know, this item in game lets you change the visual name of anything, from sharks to buckets, but this story continues one i had found one for the first time. I had made a home before this happening and i wanted loot so i went sea diving, only to be attacked by a great white shark. Somehow i survived and was very shaken up and disoriented. Scared for my life i looted the closest shipwreck and only got one single, important item...the label maker. After swimming to the surface is hopes that i would live, my raft had seemed to vanish. If you have played this game before you will know that is practically instant death in the middle of the ocean, so i weighted my chances and just decided to swim...and swim i did, for the next agonizing hour and a half i swam and swam. At which i eventually had come to a very, VERY small island containing nothing but one tree and a few rocks. After i had gotten there i spent a long time thinking of what to do, at which i found me talking to myself. AS it dragged along i loned for some companionship. I found a particularly nice shaped rock that i came to love and name Timmy. As far as making a raft out of sticks would go, it was out of the question because i needed more sticks, and there wasnt anything in sight so swimming wasnt an option either. I became attached to Timmy and we had started to slowly starve and then that was when we knew something had to happen. I chopped down the tree, which i also enjoyed very much but didnt name, grabbed a log from it and decided to yet another chance in the vast ocean of loneliness. So i put Timmy on the log with me and we set off. We probably spent two days in-game on that log and the out of nowhere a whale flips my log, along with me and Timmy. After hitting the water all i thought was "no, where could Timmy be" after about 15 seconds of frantic searching, i see my Timothy...sinking to the bottom. I swim after Timmy to retrieve my beloved friend and i see an ominous shadow of something lerking near Timmy. I realized what it is and then it scares me more the anything in a game should. As i despitely dive as fast as i can for my friend, the shadow is getting closer...bigger. With my blood pumping and my mind racing, i finally make contact with Timmy...but then it was too late...it had made contact with me and upon that came my blood spilling the waters around me...and my beloved Timothy","November 4, 2015","true","16.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","9","12","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wildfishman/recommended/313120/","wildfishman","fishman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wildfishman/","322 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBuggy or not, this is some of the most interesting exploration of any survival game I have played!  Your plane crashes somewhere in the ocean.  You swim to your rescue raft and from there you are forced to survive the best you can.  You gather resources to build, eat, and drink.  While you are paddling across the ocean from island to island, you see sunken ships that you can explore, if you are daring enough to face the numerous and very aggressive sharks.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics, over-all, are very well done.  Crafting is very realistic; you pile the resources you need and use the appropriate tool which provides the appropriate context menu for whatever you are crafting, providing the materials are there.  I just wish you could disassemble your buildings in case you have placed them incorrectly.  You can destroy them, but you don't get the materials back, and materials can be scarce.\n\nThe hunting/fishing with a spear is okay, but the animation feels weak.  I haven't attempted hunting a shark yet, but I have seen it done on youtube.  Crab is very nutritious, but they need to be cooked on a fire.  Coconuts are the staple food for beginners, as they provide drink and food.  You can also cook sardines and shark, and maybe the manta ray that I see swimming around.\n\nExploration is very interesting.  You never know what you will find in sunken ships.  You only have a limited amount of air (your lungs) and no gauge, so you will have to time the long dives carefully, and bring a flashlight!  It gets dark in the sunken ships.  You also have to watch out for sharks when you are diving.  There are also wrecks on the coasts of the islands.\n\nOne of the most annoying "features" of the game, besides the numerous and overaggressive sharks, is that when you build motor rafts (you  have to find the motor parts), and throttle them, you get thrown off at every island zone, and about every 5 seconds randomly in the zones.  I am sure they will fix this eventually, after all, it is early release.  [Update]: It has been fixed.  You are no longer thrown from motor rafts.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys any other survival game.  It is a load of fun!","February 15, 2015","true","19.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","6"

The developers are updating the game (so far), the gameplay is really good. The only con with this game is that you are suppose to survive in the ocean, and that's not my favorite element because the sea is giving me the creeps... The ocean in this game is so freaking scary, it always feels like there is a big shark, whale or a giant occtupus lurking deep under you in the sea (it kinda feels like a horror game sometimes)... For example, this have happend me several times but the last time it was like this:\n\nI where in the liferaft on my way to another island to get some more materials, and I am surrounded by dark water (I know that I'am on the deep sea now). I see a shadow move below me in the water and I start to paddle as fast as I can. I feel that the liferaft is getting pushed now, and suddenly I am in the water and my raft is drifting away from me... I can't see the shark but I know that she is close so I start to swim for all it 's worth, trying to catch my liferaft (I have the chills during the whole time I'm in the water)...

I'm glad this has been fixed and now I have contiued to play once again.\n\nTL;DR\nI ONLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME IF YOU ARE PATIENT AND KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GETTING INTO. IT IS AN ALPHA GAME SO IT'S LACKING GAMEPLAY. IT'S VERY WELL POLISHED. LOTS OF POTENTIAL.  ~Thomas The Dank Train™\n"11 Burriots out of 7 Tacos" -IGN\n\nTHE REVIEW:\nI've played this game for about 7 hours and I think it's safe to say that I've pretty much seen most, if not all of what the game has to offer right now. I absoluetly love the idea of being stranded on an island and being able to craft/build your home. I can't wait for whatever the dev's are working on as I'm already statisfied with spending the $15 for this alpha. With that being said I don't think I can fully recommend this game, yet. Since it is still in alpha, it lacks indepth gameplay such as more craftable items or buildings, a big gamebreaking bug(*I shall explain later on the in the BUGS section) but I do however love the direction and they have sold me on their idea. There is lots of potentional on this title and would love for this game to be fully fleshed out unlike other Early Access game which have been terrible at management or have just ran with the money.\n\n*#'s = means I will be talking about them in the OTHER THOUGHTS section\n\nPROS:\n**************************************************************************************************************************************\n-Beautiful graphics/Scenery: It's not the best but it's damn good looking for an Alpha. Stunning sunset/sunrise with beautiful night sky!\n\n-Wrist Watch!: Love how it is a way to show your Health/Hunger/Thirst/Days Survived as well as your general Time/Weather : It adds to the emersion unlike the Lone Dark *1\n\n-Weather: Only thing I've seen was rainstorms but boy was it scary when your halfway to a different island and it shortens your visibility to a couple feet. *2\n\n-Crafting: I should have payed attention in the tutorial but it's pretty easy. Place anything or everything that's used for crafting in a big pile and right click. If you have enough things, you will be able to see what you can craft. *3\n**************************************************************************************************************************************\nCONS:\n====================================================================================\n-Building: I found it unintuitive that you needed to have the items near the foundation to be able to build. It didn't make sense. How come I can pile everything together and see what i can craft but not see all of the things I can build.\nEx. If you have 8 sticks you are able to build a foundation. But if you have other resources, you still can only see build a foundation unless you've built the foundation and those resources are near it. *4\n\n-Resources: If you got a building/crafting system it would be nice to actually gather everything you see in the island. As of right now you can only gather wood from palms trees or find drift wood, BUT NOT FROM OTHER TREES ON THE ISLAND. (Will be forgiven since it's alpha) Also I found that there's only a set amount of rocks on an island and if you run out you'll have to just paddle to another one. This would be fine except for a gamebreaking bug. *5\n\n-Island Size: Islands that I've encountered have been small. Would be nice to have bigger Islands or an Archipelago to explore.(Will be forgiven since it's alpha)\n====================================================================================\n\nOTHER THOUGHTS:\n*1 I think the watch is an amazing tool and helps with the emursion, but it would be nice to take it a step further and add the Calorie System that the Lone Dark has done. I love that system except for the fact that it's a menu and breaks emersion\n\n*2 Would be nice to also have ocean weather affects. It'll make building a house near a the beach a risk but also gives a reason to why you can build your house so high up.\nEx. Big swells or waves, High or low tides , etc.\n\n*3 More craftatable items (But that's pretty much guaranteed since it's in Alpha)\n\n*4 Improve on the building placement. I like how it snaps on to other foundations but it would be nice to be able to fine tune where I want my shack. Also being able to place a ladder  from one foundation to a higher one.\nEx. Like in Kerbal Space Program you press the SHIFT Key to be able to rotate a part in a controled manner.\n\n*5 I understand that were on a island with limited resources but it would be nice to be able to chop down other trees or be able to make a pick-axe to mine more stone. Also adding flint/tinder item would make the game less reliable on the "Forever Cigarette Lighter".\nEx. Flint can be found on the beach or mined from the stone. Tinder could be the Coconut husks or leaves.\n\nBUGS:\nI've encountered a bug and it's a bug that turned me away from the game. It's that I get kicked off the raft/lifeboat and I won't be able to see it up close. I swim around it  and under it but I can't see it. Yet when I swim away like 5 feet or so, it's rendered in. I know this is a bug and not like a durability thing because I built a raft and then paddled it towards the lifeboat. Everything was fine until my raft touched the lifeboat and that too kicked me off.\n\nConclusion: The game is a fantastic demonstartion on what this developer can do. I have faith that this game will be amazing once it's done. I just can't recommend it right now for most people because it's still in Alpha and it does lack tons of gameplay. But from what I've experinced it's very well polished and optimized. Never did I encounter and frame rate issues or crashes.  Will still click yes to recommendation but it's only because I know people out there who are patient and know what they're getting into when it comes to Early Access games.\n\n~Thomas The Dank Train™\n\n"11 Burriots out of 7 Tacos" -IGN","January 27, 2015","true","35.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","1"

You get a few moments of learning on the plane before it goes down, and you have to get up to the surface. You do not get stat bars, i.e., health, stamina, hunger, thirst. Just gotta stay hydrated and fed at all times. There is no map, you are stranded. At most I have found a compass, and still have gotten confused and lost. You can only carry 8 items, some stack, stack max being 4. The crafting is all done in front of you. No need to waste materials on a silly crafting table. The wild life is great, sharks, stingrays, fish, crabs. Well made, too. The graphics are wonderful, nice water, nice weather, no complaints. Sickness... Always cook your food if you can. You can get sick, I am not sure of the side effects, since you are all alone with no guide to tell you why you just threw up. Weird pro, but its nice to actually have to let a crab sit on your fire for a while, at which point it makes a microwave 'ding', no matter where you are. Not realistic but mildly amusing.\n\nCons: Physics, warning time, placement of items, no bags?, no shadow, achievements not working.\nNot many issues I have here. Some of the physics are off, you can move four felled trees with a potato if you pull it into them. C'mon now. Warning times are hideous, you have roughly ten minutes, give or take, before you die of hunger or thirst after getting a warning saying you are weak and should eat something. Really difficult when you are traveling between islands, makes inventory space a hassle, which brings me to the final two issues. Some items, on pick up, vanish. Torches and buckets are the only two I've managed to get so far, but they vanish, and are just 'passive' items I think. Waterbottles are filled by buckets which are filled by the ocean and you can do it anywhere. Filtration isn't fast, so I'm not sure on the logic there, along with the fact I have no idea where the bucket/torch is being held, seeing as it isn't in one of my 8 slots. No bags. There is a question mark because I'm not sure if I'm missing something, or just haven't collected the materials for it yet. Would be nice to have in instances of island travel, for food/water/tools. Not having a shadow is pretty big in terms of good gameplay. I can see both of my arms, yet all the shadow is is the tool I weild. I've noticed that I should have gotten almost all the achievements by now as well, but they seem to not be working.\n\nThat's all I've got now, but it really is a great game, and despite some of the horrendous, fatal issues I've had, I can't stop playing. 8/10","May 9, 2015","true","21.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

Its several months since I actually played. Hate to be negative, but in my opinion, Beam Team really screwed up. Hopefully they will go back to basics eventually, but everything that was awesome and unique about Stranded Deep is gone. The crafting menu, 5x5 grid, island building and placement; it all takes away from the adventure. There's no more frantically swimming across deep ocean, praying not to get attacked by a shark, as you attempt to get back to your home base; because now, you see the map before playing, you no where everything (meaning 25 islands at the most) is. There's no sense of discovery and little sense of accomplishment. To a degree, it's like reading the entire strategy guide and looking up every trick/exploit before playing Fallout (To a small degree). It just isn't the same game that I played before that I would have reccomended to anyone. But with the game as it is now, I cannot reccomend it.\n\n(Right before posting this, I loaded up the game to check it out, and I have nothing more to add. Seems like they are wasting their time on things that bring nothing to the game. Again, I loved Stranded Deep the moment I turned it on. At the time, it had been out for 6-7 months, I won't even get into how much I liked it.

I've been waiting for this game for a while and I can say that I'm not disappointed! Taking into consideration that the game is in early access and does not have loads of things to do, I bought the game yesterday and already have over eight hours of gameplay, just shows that even with little variety of things to craft and do, the game kept me occupied and feeling like I was actually stranded in the middle of the sea, surviving off coconuts.\n\nFor an early access game, there has been next to no bugs and glitches for me, give and take a few sharks swimming under my island and me learning to fly by running with a palm tree in my hands. The graphics are visually exciting and the day and night cycle does make a big effect within the gaming experience.\n\nAs a lover of survival games, I have been waiting for a game that doesn't revolve around zombies or aliens, which have become a craze lately. This game fills a once missing slot in the survival genre and made me @$%& bricks when I saw my first shark! (being one of my life long fears). The crafting is fun and unique and I love it, which makes it different to every other game, so props to the person that came up with that idea xD\nSurvival really isn't easy and I can't explain the struggle when you need one more rock to complete your fire, and the island you're on doesn't provide for you. The diving is a new experience and it surely got my adrenaline going when diving to some of the deeper wrecks, checking a sunken boat to be greeted by a tiger shark as you leave isn't the calmest situation.\n\nIt took me a while to get used to the crafting recipes but once I got the hand of them they were stuck in my memory, just take a quick look at the wiki to make your life easier (link below).\n\nhttp://stranded-deep.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Crafting\n\nThis game has a lot of potential and I have high hopes for the game and the developers! I'm sure in time to come there will be a wide amount of loot and crafting recipes added, which will make the game so much better! Multiplayer will be amazing but the singleplayer is just as fun on its own, coming from a gamer that gets bored of singleplayer games quickly, it would be a shame if the multiplayer (if added) was rushed, for it to then be ruined due to it not being ready.\n\nOver all Stranded Deep is exiting and has a lot of potential for the future! It gives a solid feel to being stranded and lost at sea. It is easy to run, took less than a minute to download and is giving me many hours of fun. The physics in the game are lovely and dragging chopped down trees to your camp is actually pretty amusing, amongst throwing crabs and frisbeeing your raft! I do strongly recommend the game, although it has got a lot to be added to it for it to be perfect, I will enjoy following it as grows.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198076531255/screenshots/\n\nI hope that I've gave you a little insight to the game and feel free to message and ask questions if you would like to know anything else.\n\nThanks, Jack\n\n","January 25, 2015","true","14.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

With only my water bottle in hand, I didnt stand a chance. The shark had its way with me and I thought it best to start again since I had no life left (and that using a sharp blade of some sort would better fight off a shark attack!).\n\nMy second and current playthrough I have mastered the seas and all of its inhabitants!. I believe I'm on day 24 now and other than keeping myself hydrated and fed (all thanks to diving too deep and now developing a little female childs cough!?!?) I am on a quest for Vitamins. Other than that, I can live forever. I am an island god!!..also very much alone aside from discovering Wilson.\n\nI have found everything else to bandage me up, fix my broken bones and even cure toxins from swimming with puffer fish and eating the bad sea creatures. My main island is stacked with foods, materials and enough parts to make 4 motors and I have more gas for these motors than a night filled with mexican food (which is amazing!).\n\nI have two sheets of printer paper bound together with a very intricate map of the islands i have ventured to and their directions (thanks to my trusty giant blue compass!) which has proven to be very helpful in this game. When all the islands look the same from a distance, you need to keep track of them..\n\nIn conclusion, I really enjoy this game. It's beautiful, it grips you and you really do feel like you have to survive.\nOnce you have the main items needed to heal you in all areas, you can pretty much breathe easy. We all know this is early alpha, so this too will grow and change for the better. especially when there is an end game added to it.\n\nVery much worth the early purchase!.","February 25, 2015","true","11.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I've seen to many survival games that even though they look good once you buy them a few months later the devs take off. I went out on a limb on this and and I was glad that I did. I was a early adopter of this game and it did have a lot of glitches and rough areas to begin with, but it was an early access game so I couldn't complain. The glitches almost pushed me away, but right when I was about to leave the devs pushed out an update and fixed the issues. At that moment I was hooked. I purchased the game as a gift to my brother who also plays it now. The hardest part about this game is figuring out when you want to leave the safe haven of your starting island to go adventure. This game gives you the thrill of treasure hunting, while keeping you on your toes with the enemies of the deep.

Perfect time for a review I think.  To add my own, admitadly simple, survival background into the review I have gone through USAF SERE school and a bunch of camping as a boy scout, just so you know what frames a bit of my opinions later on.  A simple pros, cons to start with:\n\nPros:\n\n1.  It's beautiful for an early access game.  I played Rust quite a while ago and I remember what that looked like, There are moments where the game messes itself up, like tree not quite meeting the ground, but for every one of those I've stared out at a sunset over the Pacific or staring up at one of the nicest night skies I've seen.\n\n2.  Single player option.  Actually at the moment it's the only option, but so many survival/crafting games lately are multiplayer and when people's default setting seems to be griefer it's nice to just be able to try to compete only with mother nature.\n\n3.  There are no zombies.  Another default setting these day it seems.  Again, zombies are fun, I love them, but as unforgiving as mother nature herself can be it's nice to see something other than zombies as the primary antagonist.  This could be improved in the future, for example in the future rain could have more effect on the player than simply obscuring the vision.  It's a mixed blessing, a chance for fresh water to be collected without having to boil it, but also a harsh physical challenge.\n\n4.  Sharks.  I guess this will take some explaining.  I left my first island on a run to what looked like a close island (more on that later), I was dogged the whole way by a tiger shark that kept bumping my raft.  I don't even know if it's the same shark that followed me towards the shore the first time I paddled ashore, but I feel this sort of dogged antagonism from something that's probably not even the same shark.  The attitude seems about right, this coming from someone who's never seen a shark out of an aquarium, almost a sort of aggressive curiosity.  Sharks are just one of many, many things that can kill you in this game but they somehow top the list of what I don't want to see show up.\n\n5.  Atmosphere.  At least to a point.  The game does an amazing job of dropping you into the situation, but it also, at the moment, leaves you wondering why no one has noticed you're missing.  In the futuer a "winning" possibility has been promised, but for now you start as what appears to be a fairly rich guy on a private plane,  and no one seems to notice, or care, that you're missing.  That being said, the game puts you into a beautiful, but utterly hostile, environment.  Taking too long to appreciate it feels like something else is sneaking up on you.  I can't explain it to well, but it's a strange mix of excitment, anticipation, and utter fear as you sit in your raft picking out what island to paddle to next.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Crafting system.  This will be a long explanation and forms my one big gripe for the game, if you don't want to read it all, there will be times you feel like you can/should be able to do something but just can't because you haven't figured out how the developer wanted to do it.  I don't mean this as an argument that it shouldn't have one, but that the introduction to it is insufficent.  The player is literally just dropped on an island only having made a martini beforehand and you can die horribly still trying to figure out how to make a fire.  This is more of gripe when the player has collected a pile of sticks and has a lighter, the average person will  figure they can make a fire.   This in addition to the fact that the player has a knife to start with.  With sticks, a lighter and knife I know I could get a fire going with no problem.\n\nThere's more to this, recipies need ingredients that you may not know how to get, if I hadn't known what a yucca plant looked like I'd have never found lashing, and for some reason the axe creates almost everything, despite the fact you could smash a rock with a hammer just as easily.  Without spending some significant time with a wiki or a youtube walkthrough you'll be left staring at what seriously seems like the answer to a crafting question and it just won't work.  This extends to weird solutions to crafting problems, things like simply boiling a bucket of sea water causes it to suddenly be fresh water, which is something that simply doesn't work without a few extra steps.\n\nAlso, some ideas you may have with any survival training, like setting an empty bucket out in the rain, just don't seem to work.  In additon certain items that should be one use only, like a flare, are somehow infinate use, while others that should be fine for years, like a stainless steel survival knife, somehow fall apart in after a few days of use\n\n2.  Some items don't do what they should.  Antibiotics don't cure poison, duct tape is somehow useable after what looks like years under water, it's minor but it breaks the feeling.\n\n\n3.  This doesn't quite feel like it takes full advantage of its environment.  The South Pacific has had years of ships, planes, war and such that could have delivered supplies of some sort to the area.  Every ship seems to be a fishing trawler, every plane is  a small prop plane.  A few years of war would have delivered warships and fighter aircraft of the Empire of Japan, the United States and United Kingdom to the area for World War II alone.  That doesn't even count numerous civilian wrecks and ships that have gone missing through the years.  I just feel like it would give some character.\n\n4.  Navigation through the world.  The first island you start on will probably be ungodly small, and every island seems to be the same way.  They're a few trees, a few rocks, maybe some lashing and the random ship or aircraft wreck.   Each of these takes several minutes to navigate through, the entire time of which you will seemingly be shadowed by a shark with the raft constantly bumped.  The shark I'm ok with, as I stated earlier, but the reason I bring it up is because the risk doesn't ever seem to fit the reward.  I risked several long journeys across hostile waters for a few more sticks and rocks.  I never managed to find a bigger island or some sort of cache of supplies that seemed to make it worth it.  Maybe it's random bad luck,  but I just never felt like my expeditions really paid off.\n\n5.  Set character.  I know for a game like this it seems like a minor gripe, but being able to be something other than a random white guy would be nice, I'm assuming this will change in the future so for now, no real complaint that would have kept me from buying the game.\n\nAll in all, I'm certain I'm keeping the game, despite having to look up crafting and spend some time with tutorials, I've enjoyed my time with it so far.  That isn't so much based off my satsisfaction with what it is right now, rather it's based off the potential I see in the game, and potential the developers could take advantage of to create something other than the same old post-apocalyptic suvival MMO where every random person tries to kill you.","June 19, 2015","true","6.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I'm  torn between recommending it for now, because I think it can become very fun, later, but right now - it is not fun. That costs it the recommendation. You can create the means for survival on your first island, usually. This is not saying the game is too easy, but that's really it. There's zero reason to continue playing after that. Sure, you can explore and find more stuff, but there's not a point to it. Finding flares, making weapons, building anything beyond a little shack holds zero reward. It doesn't unlock new skills for your character, there's no fun things waiting at the bottom of the oceans, so it's just a "Leave base. Find stuff. Return. Eat/Drink. Repeat."\n\nAgain, this game has potential. Potential isn't fun, though.\n\n","June 24, 2015","false","3.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030485083/recommended/313120/","76561198030485083","Fire For Effect","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030485083/","334 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo, at the moment of writing this I have about an hour and a half into the game, right where most people will decide to ask for a refund or keep playing.  Perfect time for a review I think.  To add my own, admitadly simple, survival background into the review I have gone through USAF SERE school and a bunch of camping as a boy scout, just so you know what frames a bit of my opinions later on.  A simple pros, cons to start with:\n\nPros:\n\n1.  It's beautiful for an early access game.  I played Rust quite a while ago and I remember what that looked like, There are moments where the game messes itself up, like tree not quite meeting the ground, but for every one of those I've stared out at a sunset over the Pacific or staring up at one of the nicest night skies I've seen.\n\n2.  Single player option.  Actually at the moment it's the only option, but so many survival/crafting games lately are multiplayer and when people's default setting seems to be griefer it's nice to just be able to try to compete only with mother nature.\n\n3.  There are no zombies.  Another default setting these day it seems.  Again, zombies are fun, I love them, but as unforgiving as mother nature herself can be it's nice to see something other than zombies as the primary antagonist.  This could be improved in the future, for example in the future rain could have more effect on the player than simply obscuring the vision.  It's a mixed blessing, a chance for fresh water to be collected without having to boil it, but also a harsh physical challenge.\n\n4.  Sharks.  I guess this will take some explaining.  I left my first island on a run to what looked like a close island (more on that later), I was dogged the whole way by a tiger shark that kept bumping my raft.  I don't even know if it's the same shark that followed me towards the shore the first time I paddled ashore, but I feel this sort of dogged antagonism from something that's probably not even the same shark.  The attitude seems about right, this coming from someone who's never seen a shark out of an aquarium, almost a sort of aggressive curiosity.  Sharks are just one of many, many things that can kill you in this game but they somehow top the list of what I don't want to see show up.\n\n5.  Atmosphere.  At least to a point.  The game does an amazing job of dropping you into the situation, but it also, at the moment, leaves you wondering why no one has noticed you're missing.  In the futuer a "winning" possibility has been promised, but for now you start as what appears to be a fairly rich guy on a private plane,  and no one seems to notice, or care, that you're missing.  That being said, the game puts you into a beautiful, but utterly hostile, environment.  Taking too long to appreciate it feels like something else is sneaking up on you.  I can't explain it to well, but it's a strange mix of excitment, anticipation, and utter fear as you sit in your raft picking out what island to paddle to next.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Crafting system.  This will be a long explanation and forms my one big gripe for the game, if you don't want to read it all, there will be times you feel like you can/should be able to do something but just can't because you haven't figured out how the developer wanted to do it.  I don't mean this as an argument that it shouldn't have one, but that the introduction to it is insufficent.  The player is literally just dropped on an island only having made a martini beforehand and you can die horribly still trying to figure out how to make a fire.  This is more of gripe when the player has collected a pile of sticks and has a lighter, the average person will  figure they can make a fire.   This in addition to the fact that the player has a knife to start with.  With sticks, a lighter and knife I know I could get a fire going with no problem.\n\nThere's more to this, recipies need ingredients that you may not know how to get, if I hadn't known what a yucca plant looked like I'd have never found lashing, and for some reason the axe creates almost everything, despite the fact you could smash a rock with a hammer just as easily.  Without spending some significant time with a wiki or a youtube walkthrough you'll be left staring at what seriously seems like the answer to a crafting question and it just won't work.  This extends to weird solutions to crafting problems, things like simply boiling a bucket of sea water causes it to suddenly be fresh water, which is something that simply doesn't work without a few extra steps.\n\nAlso, some ideas you may have with any survival training, like setting an empty bucket out in the rain, just don't seem to work.  In additon certain items that should be one use only, like a flare, are somehow infinate use, while others that should be fine for years, like a stainless steel survival knife, somehow fall apart in after a few days of use\n\n2.  Some items don't do what they should.  Antibiotics don't cure poison, duct tape is somehow useable after what looks like years under water, it's minor but it breaks the feeling.\n\n\n3.  This doesn't quite feel like it takes full advantage of its environment.  The South Pacific has had years of ships, planes, war and such that could have delivered supplies of some sort to the area.  Every ship seems to be a fishing trawler, every plane is  a small prop plane.  A few years of war would have delivered warships and fighter aircraft of the Empire of Japan, the United States and United Kingdom to the area for World War II alone.  That doesn't even count numerous civilian wrecks and ships that have gone missing through the years.  I just feel like it would give some character.\n\n4.  Navigation through the world.  The first island you start on will probably be ungodly small, and every island seems to be the same way.  They're a few trees, a few rocks, maybe some lashing and the random ship or aircraft wreck.   Each of these takes several minutes to navigate through, the entire time of which you will seemingly be shadowed by a shark with the raft constantly bumped.  The shark I'm ok with, as I stated earlier, but the reason I bring it up is because the risk doesn't ever seem to fit the reward.  I risked several long journeys across hostile waters for a few more sticks and rocks.  I never managed to find a bigger island or some sort of cache of supplies that seemed to make it worth it.  Maybe it's random bad luck,  but I just never felt like my expeditions really paid off.\n\n5.  Set character.  I know for a game like this it seems like a minor gripe, but being able to be something other than a random white guy would be nice, I'm assuming this will change in the future so for now, no real complaint that would have kept me from buying the game.\n\nAll in all, I'm certain I'm keeping the game, despite having to look up crafting and spend some time with tutorials, I've enjoyed my time with it so far.  That isn't so much based off my satsisfaction with what it is right now, rather it's based off the potential I see in the game, and potential the developers could take advantage of to create something other than the same old post-apocalyptic suvival MMO where every random person tries to kill you.","June 19, 2015","true","6.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I know its on Alpha, but it really needs a lot more substance. I have found you can survive quite easily with just a knife, paddle and your liferaft and keep moving. Life only becomes difficult if you camp as resources can run out very quickly. Illness and injury left untreated sees your hunger and thirst drop rapidly so save regularly and restart if you get injured, sick cause vitamins etc can be hard to come by. I have found if you are healthy you can live on two to three coconuts a day in game. You dont even have to worry about boiling sea water. The abundance of wrecks is pretty repetetive and dull, but the environments look great. It plays and looks like Far Cry, which is a good thing. A survival version of Far Cry would be awesome. It needs a lot of work to have any long term interest for gamers. More animals, NPC's, larger variety of islands, plants, and a lot more interaction with the environment. Im not giving up on the game cause it has great potential.","February 11, 2015","true","45.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

It's also an amazingly small DL, which is incredible, considering how gorgeous the graphics are.\n\nOne thing that impressed me most was that it had a tutorial(Sort of). Sure, it didn't explain everything and left me trying to figure out how to relight a campfire, it did help with the basics.

Content has a solid base and is being expanded monthly.  Good game concept with lots of room for expansion.  Easy to immerse yourself into this game and forget the headaches of the day.  Bugs are to be expected, but for such an early game this one is well on it's way to being my favorite.\n\nTime for an update on my review.  I know what the hours say on my profile, but the Steam system is very inaccurate I'm afraid.  It does not count offline hours, while it does count online hours where the client is open and not being played at all.  So far I am running a little over 200 hours split between two laptops.  My initial review was short due to my short exposure to the game.  As that exposure increases I will keep this review up to date.\n\nCurrently I still give the game a thumbs up.\nPros:\nActive development and regular progress.  Most of what I have seen being worked on lately has been very labor and time intensive.  They are very active in bug fixing and are visibly working with testers from the player community to correct these bugs.\n\nDevelopers release client updates fairly often,  I can think of at least 4 client updates in the past 2 months, and I think there was actually 5 but that last one was pretty much just bug fixes only.\n\nCommunication between the developers and the community seems to be pretty good and frequent these past few months since my initial review.  They are using a company website, two Trello sites, facebook, twitter, and Steam for communication so it is spread out a bit, but the moderators and some of the community seem to be working together to consolidate these onto Steam.\n\nThey have been using suggestions from the community in the game development, which is a very nice thing to see, and it also shows that the developers do in fact listen to the community.  Something I like to see, even though it can be distracting at times for developers.\n\nWhile visible content has been thin the feature systems seem to be evolving and progressing, and more visible content is starting to be released.  The depth of the immersion is starting to intensify with upgraded weather and ocean systems.  I cannot state that the next update will in fact produce the increased content and features as stated, but so far the developers have kept to their word as much as humanly possible and as such I tend to trust that this next update will be everything that they have claimed.\n\nThe developers have expanded their dev team and the increase in output has been very obvious since they hired a new dev.  Another strong indicator that the game is not only active in development but that the developers are in fact motivated to produce this game.\n\nThe game has some strong community support with a number of key individuals who help provide more formal testing and assist other players with questions and solving issues.  One of the more reliable signs of a good game design, btw.\nCross platform support.  Currently the game supports both Windows and Mac OS, and they have stated an intent to support Linux in the future.  Most games are developed for a single platform initially and additional platforms are supported after release of the game, in order to allow the development team to focus on game completion first.\n\nCons:\nLow visible content at the moment leads some players to become bored after a short period of play, say several days to a few weeks worth.  However this does seem to be changing with the new updates and the game is still in early alpha.  So this is a limited negative and I believe based upon historical evidence that it will be rectified shortly.  I could guess by the end of this month, but that would be just a guess, not fact.\n\nCross platform development.  I feel that with such a small development team this MAY have been a bad choice, to develop for multiple platforms at the same time rather than wait until the game has been released for the first platform.  There are pros and cons to this, and I listed it as both for that reason.\n\nOther Observations:\n\nOne of the things that I have found refreshing with Stranded Deep is that by design the game allows for a wide range of play styles.  The developers have been building Stranded Deep as a survival game, and yet they have ensured that players have enough features and lattitude to survive their own way or style.  Most survival games either require you to survive by their "rules" or at the least they mark off some form of point system for not surviving by their design goal or method.  Stranded Deep seems more about the immersion into that world and it's environment and leaves you to figure out how you will survive on your own.  The path you take is up to you and the game supports it.  A unique approach yet far more realistic than others in the survival genre.","June 7, 2015","true","120.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Game.\nStranded Deep is an open-world survival game set in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. You play as a man who has just survived a plane crash, equipped with water, a lighter, a knife, and a life raft with a paddle.\nTHE OBJECTIVE:\nThe point of the game is to survive. Seems simple enough right? Take into consideration the dangers in this world. You have sharks, which most of them attack you (Word to the wise: If you see a great white shark, run). There are also poisonous fish and plants, which will poison you if you even touch them. You also have a hunger and thirst bar, which you can see by switching menus on the watch. You have to keep these up by eating cooked food, otherwise you can and will die. And if you run out of supplies on your first island? Prepare for the voyage to the next.\nPROS:\n-Amazing graphics, even at minimum graphics settings.\n-Surreal gameplay\n-Simple crafting systems\n-Realistic dangers\n-Sharks\n-Easter Eggs!\n-Frequent updates and hotfixes. The developers are very much inclined to their customers.\nCONS:\n-You will, eventually, run out of things to do in this game. The same can be said of many other games, however, and if you start over, you will always get a different set of islands to explore\n-As with most early access games, it is quite buggy. I'm excited to see the final result of this game, because once most of the bugs are polished out, this game will be a masterpiece!\n-Most items you need to survive are very rare and can only be found in plane wrecks or ship wrecks. This does add an interesting concept to the game, but new players may find the task of diving in dangerous waters daunting.\nCONCLUSION:\nThis is an amazing game! After playing for a few hours, I forgot the game was in early access!

Game.\nStranded Deep is an open-world survival game set in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. You play as a man who has just survived a plane crash, equipped with water, a lighter, a knife, and a life raft with a paddle.\nTHE OBJECTIVE:\nThe point of the game is to survive. Seems simple enough right? Take into consideration the dangers in this world. You have sharks, which most of them attack you (Word to the wise: If you see a great white shark, run). There are also poisonous fish and plants, which will poison you if you even touch them. You also have a hunger and thirst bar, which you can see by switching menus on the watch. You have to keep these up by eating cooked food, otherwise you can and will die. And if you run out of supplies on your first island? Prepare for the voyage to the next.\nPROS:\n-Amazing graphics, even at minimum graphics settings.\n-Surreal gameplay\n-Simple crafting systems\n-Realistic dangers\n-Sharks\n-Easter Eggs!\n-Frequent updates and hotfixes. The developers are very much inclined to their customers.\nCONS:\n-You will, eventually, run out of things to do in this game. The same can be said of many other games, however, and if you start over, you will always get a different set of islands to explore\n-As with most early access games, it is quite buggy. I'm excited to see the final result of this game, because once most of the bugs are polished out, this game will be a masterpiece!\n-Most items you need to survive are very rare and can only be found in plane wrecks or ship wrecks. This does add an interesting concept to the game, but new players may find the task of diving in dangerous waters daunting.\nCONCLUSION:\nThis is an amazing game! After playing for a few hours, I forgot the game was in early access! It is a great game, and although it has its bugs, it is worth the money.\nI rate this game 9/10, due to it's somewhat lack of replayability.\nDo I recommend this game?

Like, KOS sorta Minecraft zombie aggressive. Don't complain about how sharks don't behave that way in real life.\n\nYou will run out of food, forcing you to go to other islands. Hence the shark problem.\n\nSharks have a small chance of glitching into land.\n\nThe graphics are very good, and you will almost never have FPS problems in tis game. I have a slow computer and I run it just fine. Also the gameplay and interface are reasonably realistic, and to see your vitals you need to look at your survival watch instead of just having a floating box show it all the time.\n\nExploring shipwrecks is pretty fun, although it can be really scary at times (especially at night!)\nThere are also many Easter Eggs to be found in Stranded Deep, and I'm not going to spoil any of them. Of course, there's always the Stranded Deep Wikia.\n\nStranded Deep is quite rough around the edges, and may have some bugs.

Stranded Deep is perhaps the most uninteresting, least-intuitive game I've played in quite a long while. The crafting system is a bit asinine, the carry space one has in inventory is laughably small, and resources too sparse to be vaguely realistic (there are rocks everywhere in the environment, but only perhaps 4-5 usable stones per island.) It doesn't seem possible at this point to craft any storage devices or backpacks.\n\nWhile it is apparently possible to survive indefinitely on a single island (provided one doesn't chop down all the palm trees, thereby removing the only source of drinkable water I've thus far found,) abject boredom will drive the player to explore nearby islands via raft. Whilst underway, sharks will attempt to dislodge the player, but instead just knock everything overboard one might have been trying to transport. The other reason to explore is to find valuable items... which one doesn't really need at all.\n\nI grant you, I've only given this a few of hours of my time, but couldn't stand anything longer than that. It's pretty and has a good concept, but compelling content is lacking.\n\nI most definitely do not recommend Stranded Deep, and I'm quite surprised the reviews seem to be mostly positive. Perhaps farther down the development line, this will be interesting and engaging.\n\nRather than slog through this sub-par game, I would recommend... well, almost anything else. For a pure survival experience, The Long Dark or The Forest. For adventure and exploration, ARK Evolved. Even Rising World far outclasses Stranded Deep at this point.","August 16, 2015","false","2.6"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deewbot/recommended/313120/","deewbot","DeEwBoT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deewbot/","95 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet me start off by saying, if you're really into survival games, then you'll love this. Right off the bat, the game pays homage to Cast Away. If you don't know what that is, it's a movie with Tom Hanks. Great movie, go watch it. It's on Netflix...\n\nThat being said, this game is a lot like The Forest. A lot of people have made that connection already, but this game differs a lot in the fact that THIS game is pure survival. There is no end game & there are no crazy natives trying to kill & eat your face. Yet... The Devs have hinted that the final release may have you aiming at being rescued.\n\nAs the game stands right now, it's pretty buggy. I'm not going to go into detail about the bugs, if you want to know what they are, just check the community page. Plenty of people crying about them. With that ALSO being said, let me throw out a BIG DISCLAIMER here for anyone reading this & thinking of buying this game... This game is EARLY ACCESS! Meaning it's at least in Alpha right now.  If you buy this expecting a flawless 100% title, you're going to be very VERY disappointed!\n\nThis game is still under development & will be updated regularly by the Dev team who will be fixing bugs & glitches & adding new content to the game. Right now there really isn't a whole lot you can do in the game aside from just basic survival stuff. Gather food, build a shelter, search for Wilson (Cast Away reference) & scavange sunken ships. In fact the game in it's current state is kinda boring after a few hours, but the world is infinite. Procedurally generated everything lets you travel the sea forever! So no two islands are alike & there's always new ships & gear to be found & THAT'S what keeps people playing. This game has the 'I wonder' factor going for it.\n\nThe graphics in this game is another one of its strong points. In fact, I'd say it's the back bone of the game. Everything set to max, even in the current build, the wolrd is just breath taking. One of the best looking games I've seen in a while.\n\nThe game has a very akward crafting system that takes some getting used to. It's just so opposite to the crafting systems of so many other games, but not in a bad way. It helps to create the realistic feeling that you're really stranded on an island & NOT in a video game. Also there is no HUD. All the info you need to know is located on your wrist watch, adding to the realism & immersion of the overall game.\n\nAll in all I'd give the current build of this game a 7-10. The bugs don't really bother me because I know it's early access, my lower score comes from the lack of overall things to do. Would like to point out though that the devs hinted at adding multiplayer in the future. So you could potentially end up surviving with a friend. Keep in mind they didn't confirm this, they were just answering a question someone asked by saying they liked to do that & that they have big plans for the game on down the road.","January 25, 2015","true","4.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

WELL THEN, JUST BUY STRANDED DEEP. It's like Cast Away the movie but with 100% less Tom Hanks!\n\nThis game is amazing, there are a few mechanics that are possibly too hard on the player and some too easy... let's begin with the easy:\n-Crabs. Essentially an unlimited, respawning food source. I'm not sure how they respawn but I usually leave a few behind from each cluster and a few days later harvest all the new ones. Food really is no issue with crabs.\n-Buckets? I've found a bucket on my first island every play through. It's infinite water essentially - I like how it works (except holding the bucket over a fire is essentially impossible because my character always holds the damn thing sideways) I think the spawning of them is perhaps too common though.\n-Land. This is a weird critique but due to the fact that with a bucket and a crab collony you can last forever - it gives no reason to leave the island. Having no threats on land made me a lot less willing to leave and actually face off against sharks.\n\nNow let's discuss some of the harder elements:\n-Storage. Why is there no mechanic to store my food neatly somewhere? I'd really like a table to place my possesions on in my house. In general I'm hoping the building mechanics are fleshed out a bit (of course for the game being in pre-alpha they have done a lot but this is just a suggestion for future). Whilst on the topic: windows and dissasembling placed structures. Too many times have I had to destroy something because it didn't snap to a corner properly.\n- Navigation. There's a generic 'island in the distance' model I've noticed. Thus you have no idea how far away each island is and at a distance there is no possible way to tell them apart. The compass can be looted but good luck without it. I don't mind the rafts being slow- but the issue of direction and distance needs to be addressed.\n-resource. The islands are tiny, and thus run out of resource very fast - this encourages you to leave the island. I like this mechanic but could we get a little diversity? maybe islands of significant different size? With this issue of Islands being light-years apart and navigation being as tricky as it is, it's really difficult to actually explore. (Big Islands Mod - Uploaded by I-o-IPositive7, fixes this issue - but makes the resources too plentiful - I would recommend an inbetween).\n-Storage - Again. How are you supposed to take resource back to your island if you only have 8 slots? if you're going to survive there for a while you're at least going to need 2-3 tools like a lighter, Machette, and Spear. You will also need a bucket and the paddle to move the raft. that's at least half your space gone on items too valuable to throw away. If you were building a house this is way too inefficient. Could we PLEASE get a way to store some items on the boat.\n\nThat pretty much addresses all my main issues, I love this game thus far and see it as a game with incredible potential.\n\nNOTE: I UNDERSTAND THIS IS IN ALPHA STAGES - I WANTED TO MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO WHAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN FUTURE UPDATES. a it currently stands I love what I have to play with maybe 8/10 knowing that the game is yet to b completed.

I'm glad I had that cocktail before we went down.  Looks like the last alcohol I'll have for a while.  Appears I am the only survivor.  No sign of the pilot or co-pilot.  Made it to an island and trying to make shelter.\nDay 2:  Shelter is made, gathered some coconuts for food, and have a nice stockpile of building materials.  Noticed a shark off the coast and have decided to name him George.\nDay 3: Tossed some sardines off the coast for George and took off on the other side in my raft to find gear.  Took a few days and searched 4 islands and nothing worth mentioning.\nDay 6:  Was almost back to my island and George tried to eat me.  I guess he's mad that I havent fed him these past few days.  Sorry George.\nDay 7:  Woke up and fed George some more sardines, and hit the island to my east.  George followed me the entire way.  Nothing here except a DeadEx box.\nDay 8:  Fed George again before heading back home.  He flipped me out of the raft twice on the way back.  Gonna have to deal with him asap.\nDay 9:  George tried to eat me again this morning.  I ended up killing him with my spear.  I currently have him roasting over my campfire.  I hope he tastes good.\n\n\nBasically thats all there is.  Swim from island to island being able to carry a minimum of items. And I do mean minimum.  You are given 8 slots, each of which can carry 4 of the same item.  If you actually manage to find anything decent on an island you usually have to either swim, or paddle several trips to get everything.

While you are able to do little else then directly survive (cooking, exploring and building a very simple hut.) the game shows a surprising amount of potential, seen in it's uniquely beautiful yet terrifying moments.\n\nGraphics: Stunning. Using Unity, the same engine as the Forest (A highly recommended game), Stranded Deep is both beautiful and forgiving to those of us who have lesser gaming computers and laptops.\n\nSound: The lack of music, except a few pangs when sharks are nearby, is both immersing and at times, regretful. A good score could really up the ante of the world SD has built.\n\nPlayability: The game is very playable, with a interesting crafting system and procedurelly generated world. however, very little has actually been added in the way of gameplay.\n\nCOMPLETE REVIEW:\n\nStranded Deep begins with you being jolted awake from your nap aboard a private jet flying over the atlantic. After making yourself a tasty martini you return to your seat only to watch the emergancy door explode, leaving a gaping hole in the aircraft and eventually crashing it. After swimming out of the sinking plane you climb aboard the life raft and begin your journey into the merciless yet beautiful world of the uncharted isles of the Pacific.\n\nThe first thing you will probably notice about Stranded Deep is it's beautiful world. From little sandbars to larger (but still laughably small) islands, from little wooden life boats sunk in the sand to huge container ships resting under 30 feet of water, SD had no shortage of fun and stunning moments. My first death was a result of my curiosity getting the better of me as I swam 20 feet down to a sunken Trapper and soon drowned whilst rumaging through a locker.\n\nNow, by noticing this first thing you'll certainly notice the second thing, sharks. The only tangible enemy of the game, the sharks will nudge and bump and even flip your raft over. Blood attracts them, noise attracts them, and they love to gang up against you like a band of orcas to a helpless seal. They are still simplistic in thier mindset, and while the will happily bite off your legs or back while your turned, the tend to run away scared when you swim after them with a sharp weapon. You'll know when sharks are near when a short burst of ominous music plays.\n\nAs the game is in alpha, there isnt much to do yet. You can build fires, cook fish that you spear, eat coconuts, build a small hut, loot some odds and ends from ships. The game at the moment is a cycle of island hopping and exploring, but i expect it to be much more in the future.\n\nWhat i am personally excited for is Co-Op and multiplayer, as this game will be tons of fun to play with others. I'm also excited for the release of the mian map, whenever that will be, which will have large island as well as small ones, lots more wrecks and special places, and tons more to do. Also and endgame, which isnt in the game yet.\n\nAll in all, the game is extremely simplistic right now, but it is going places without a doubt. If you have a spare 15 to cough up on a indie game, cough it up here.\n\nIdeas for the Creators:\n- Sea Caves\n- 18th century ships\n- make foundations combinable, especially rafts, so that we can create larger structires and even "house boats"\n- dolphins :D\n- A Lost referance\n- More rocks. i mean hell, they are practically a luxury right now.\n- derelict boats that can be rebuilt possibly?","January 29, 2015","true","12.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I think it sums up the game very well.\n\nSo, I start up the game, and I paddle my way past a few islands until I find one that I'd like to settle down on. It has a nice stretch of beach, view of some other islands, reefs nearby, and beautiful sunsets; in other words, the perfect place to build a sprawling vacation home. So, I make myself an axe and gather enough wood and stones to create a fire pit with a spit, then spear a few fish, laying the extras next to the fire, and cook them as needed to satisfy my hunger. I then proceed to deforest the entire island in a very organized manner; cutting down trees, dragging them all into a neat line, chopping them up, arranging the logs side by side to take inventory and plan out how much of my house I'll be able to build, then making poles out of them in one giant pile. Eventually, I'm able to build about half my house, laying down most of the foundation and two walls. Given the amount of back-and-forth carrying I have to do, I decide to drop my knife somewhere on the beach. I'll never need it, right?\nIt becomes clear that I'm going to need to travel to another island to gather the wood necessary to complete my home. So, I nibble on a fish before setting out, but I feel a bit sick to my stomach afterwards.\nAs I'm paddling towards the closest island, I notice some boils on my arm, but don't think much of it. However, as I get closer, I notice that I'm starving. Seeing that my axe is about to break, I decide to get some wood to make a new one before this one expires. As I bring down a tree, though, the tool shatters in my hands. It's now that I notice I have no lashing, and no means to obtain any, since I need a sharp object. The knife is all the way back at the other island, I can't craft a new axe, and my condition is steadily worsening.\nI start to panic. How am I going to live through this? I remember, though, that sometimes sharp tools can be found in shipwrecks, and luckily enough, there seems to be a wreck near me. I dive into the water like a madman, swimming my way to the wreckage, and, sure enough, there's a chest. My boil-covered arms pry it open, and hope fills my heart... Only to find that it contains a flashlight. Damn it.\nEmerging from the water with a crazed look in my (actual) eyes, I resolve that the only way to possibly survive this is to go back the way I came and hope that I can find the knife on that beach so I can use it to break open a few coconuts. I frantically paddle my way there, but soon, I see another shipwreck beneath the waves. Desperate for a quick solution, I throw the paddle down on the raft and leap spread-eagle into the water, my heart beating to the time of the electronic beeps my watch is using to tell my I'm about to die. I swim down, down, down, until finally a ship comes into sight. Will this be my saving grace?\nOf course not. The ship has absolutely nothing for me. I turn my gaze upwards, and am greeted by the lovely sight of two circling sharks. At this point, though, fear has no meaning, so I propel myself to the surface, climbing aboard the raft and getting my bearings. But there are no bearings to be found; I have no idea which island is which, and, for the first time in my life, feel what it's like to be lost at sea. The problem with this is that I need that one specific island on which I left the knife. Eeny, meeny, miney... mo. I pick an island and paddle towards it, my vitals ever-failing.\nAs I approach the land mass, my heart leaps into my mouth; by sheer luck, I'd picked the right island. Ecstatic, I leap from the raft and swim to shore, sprinting with everything I've got to the stretch of beach that I left the knife on. My eyes comb the sand, but it's nowhere to be found. God damn it, where is it?\nThen, I notice some materials I left on the ground before I left: binding and sticks! In keeping with my day, however, I have no rock to complete the axe. My adrenaline-fueled vision catches one in the distance, and I sprint for it, grabbing it in my shaking hands and tossing it into a pile with the other ingredients before finishing my crude masterpiece. As soon as I feel the weight of the tool in my hand, though, I remember the fire pit. Rushing over, I slap myself when I realize that I left a cooked fish by the pit in the event of an emergency like this. The stress really did get to my head.\nRelieved, I sink my teeth into the fish, but as I swallow, I remember... It's been left out long enough to rot.\nSure enough, my vision begins to swim, and sickness rushes over me. I'm now on the verge of death, a combination of extreme starvation and severe illness. In a final act of desperation, I stick a fish onto the fire spit. If I can just hold out a few seconds more, I'll live through this...\nMy vitals fail. As my legs buckle beneath me and I fall to the ground, I hear the mocking 'ding' of my watch timer, reminding me that my meal is done cooking. I die staring at that cooked fish with my unfinished dream home in the background, wondering what could have been.\n\nIf you're still reading, good for you. This is the only game I've ever played (and I've played A LOT of games like this) where I've truly felt like I'm fighting for my life. It will only get better from here, and it's already well worth the purchase. Don't miss this one; I got royally ♥♥♥♥ed over, and that's without the sharks.\n\n10/10 would die miserably again","January 27, 2015","true","11.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Half way there, I dive to an old shipwreck down below. Found an engine part, nice! Resurfacing leaves me disoriented. As I try to find my bearings using the sun and my little knowledge of the existing islands nearby, fog rolls in and leaves me lost at sea.\n\n-Day 10\nI've discovered a buoy. Very large sharks seem to congregate around it, best leave it be. I make my way from two or three islands before passing the buoy again. Two great whites have taken interest in me and have begun to follow, I look back as I notice and begin to paddle for my life to the island just within reach. I make it. It's home.\nOne of the whites gave up and returned to the sea. I can still see him from time to time out on the water. The other managed to find its way into the geometry of my island. Thus begins the reign of the landsharks.\n\n-Day 17\nIt's been a week since the event. I'm still haunted every day by the elusive beast. It hungers. I can't sleep, it may get me in the night. I've been hopping from rock to rock in attempts to skirmish the monster with me dulling machete. All attempts seem hopeless.\n\n-Day 18\nThe rocks have saved me. The creature managed to lurch between two rocks and get stuck as I dealt the killing blow with my blade. As if by some unknown force, the shark launches from my island into the air, far and fast until it's no longer visable. Perhaps the same magic that braught such a creature into this world has taken it back.\nI think I know now what hit my plane...\n\n\n\n10/10\n10/10\n100/100\nBest game\nBEST GAME","January 30, 2015","true","27.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","3","3","5","2"

I'm glad I had that cocktail before we went down.  Looks like the last alcohol I'll have for a while.  Appears I am the only survivor.  No sign of the pilot or co-pilot.  Made it to an island and trying to make shelter.\nDay 2:  Shelter is made, gathered some coconuts for food, and have a nice stockpile of building materials.  Noticed a shark off the coast and have decided to name him George.\nDay 3: Tossed some sardines off the coast for George and took off on the other side in my raft to find gear.  Took a few days and searched 4 islands and nothing worth mentioning.\nDay 6:  Was almost back to my island and George tried to eat me.  I guess he's mad that I havent fed him these past few days.  Sorry George.\nDay 7:  Woke up and fed George some more sardines, and hit the island to my east.  George followed me the entire way.  Nothing here except a DeadEx box.\nDay 8:  Fed George again before heading back home.  He flipped me out of the raft twice on the way back.  Gonna have to deal with him asap.\nDay 9:  George tried to eat me again this morning.  I ended up killing him with my spear.  I currently have him roasting over my campfire.  I hope he tastes good.\n\n\nBasically thats all there is.  Swim from island to island being able to carry a minimum of items. And I do mean minimum.  You are given 8 slots, each of which can carry 4 of the same item.  If you actually manage to find anything decent on an island you usually have to either swim, or paddle several trips to get everything.  This game has a lot of potential, and would love to see more progress on it in the future.","March 13, 2015","true","53.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","3","3","3","0"

Items are limited, enemies are limmited, everything is...limited. Not really a game at this point IMO. Walk around. Harvest some sticks and rocks. Build a one by one hut and a fire. Kill some fish and crabs. Paddle around looking for rocks and sticks and iron scrap. Seriously iron scrap? youre telling me steel I beams just wash ashore? Welp in stranded deep they do. After you do this you can explore underwater and fine some items like flares hatches and things to build an engine for your raft. After that, nothing. There I just explained the game in one paragraph.\n\nIts pretty buggy as well(not a big deal since its alpha but just mentioning). ive gotten stuck in crouch. I get stuck on fires and trees all the time. Many of the objects arent even finished. Palm_007 the sting ray etc. Dev also could not take the 10 seconds to add a descriptions to many of the craftable items. Not really bothersome but seriously c'mon\n\nGrapphics are pretty awesome especially underwater.\n\nHope this game really improves. I realize it is in alpha but honestly alpha is for testing bugs and improving dynamics of a game from user review. Devs seem to make a pretty screenshot and put it on steam and say lets make a game together! This isn't kickstarter.

No. Wait till there are more aspects fleshed out.\nLength: Depends on how long you can survive.\nLinks: Metacritic (0.0)[www.metacritic.com] Homepage[beamteamgames.com]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=385683004\n\nA #BASED Impression *Review to come when finished*\nAs of February 02, 2015 @ Patch Hotfix 0.01\nAchievments are not working yet.\n\nIn Stranded Deep, you are no one. You are nothing. You are just a man, who was on a private jet, off to somewhere important most likely. You go to make yourself a Martini, knowing how long of a trip you have ahead of yourself. By the time you finish making it, there is a sudden uprising in turbulence. Next thing you know you are going down into the Pacific Ocean! This is where your journey begins... or ends...\n\nYou begin your journey on a life raft in a middle of a crash in the ocean. You use your trust worthy oar to make it to the closest land mass you can find. You have your basic supplies on you, a lighter, a bottle of water, a pocket knife. First things first in any survival game is to find out where you stand, what you have, and what you can build. This is what most survival games want you to do.\n\nCurrently in Stranded Deep, there is not a whole lot to do. You can build a fire pit, and slowly upgrade it over a few revisions. You can make your basic tools which include an Axe and Hammer. You can eat certain things, but as of right now they are strictly seafood, coconuts and potatoes. All is not friendly in Stranded Deep however. There is a full ocean around you that you can explore, and its full of predators... and food! The predators are the obvious sharks, but they are not all that dangerous as of yet.\n\nThere is a full night and day system implemented, and it right now does a good job on setting the mood. Although at night there is not much to do yet, other then get food ready for the next trip to the other islands. Oh wait, did i forget to tell you? There are a plethora of other islands spread through the procedurally generated Stranded Deep world. While they all share the same esthetics, they all have the materials needed to help you survive the longest. What? Did you think your tiny little Island could sustain your human wrecking ways? Think again.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=385683042","February 1, 2015","true","2.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game at its current state I cant even see as "playable" there is next to nothing to do. Islands are so far apart that you pretty much have to be nomadic to have remotely any enjoyment at all. And even then the game runs out of content in a few hours building bases takes forever and islands lack variety. That being said though there is slight differences as some will have shipwrecks others wont, but there is no real variation in size distance to another island type of terrain or anything in that field. The survival mechanics could use some work too. They're always the same go to island, find crab, kill crab, eat crab. However the graphics are on point and i'd like to see more survival games with this graphic quality.  I conclude by saying I cant recommend this game to anybody for its asking price i've gotten more content from indie games for a dollar.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSince I posted this review updates to the game have become more consistant and I have opted to play on the "expiramental" branch which i have seen noticable chance on, including new UI implementations as well as new craftables new structures and new matierials as well as custom islands and atolls. All in all it's improving and ill be watching it more closely.

You build a house, you kill crabs and grab coconuts to not starve to death, and maybe you dive down into wrecks to gather *surprise* another hatchet and machete. Of which you already have a dozen.

I was about 20 days into my survival when my raft magically dissappeard from under me. This gameis far too glitchy with barely any variation or crafting. I can build like 10 things over and over again then run out of resources and move on to another area. The sea life has barely any variation with some species that arent even native to the area. the game is realistic in terms of surviving, but the point of games is also to enjoy myself and when its the same thing all the time then that i am going to get bored.\n\nEnvironment:\nFun at first, but gets old fast. The islands are all almost identicalactually every biome is just same thing repeating itself over again with barely anything interesting in it. The shipwrecks have about three general layouts and thats it. I am bored and it is not creative. 3/10\n\nCrafting:\nthe crafting mechanism is simple to use, but its always just the same thing. They are barely adding anything to it. Seriously, there isnt even a fishing pole. my guy is too stupid to build a fishing pole yet he can build a hut and other useful tools. 6/10 needs more variety\n\nGlitches:\nAwful. The game is filled with them. Sharks swimming into shallow water and dissapear. raft disappearing out from under me. unable to reignite fire spit. (all of which happened within one game) 0/10\n\nCombat/hunting:\nHunting sharks is probably the most fun thing to do. Its the only thing that makes the game worth while then again it gets prettyrepetitive and once you figure out how to kill them it becomes easy. 7/10\n\nScavenging:\nsimilar to crafting. it's simple, but there is no variety. After a few solid survival stints you have seen everyhting the world has to offer. 5/10\n\nOverall, the concept and game are great, but they get boring so quickly that i cannot reccomend this game. The developers need to really step their game up if they dont want to start losing customers. The game is currently at "very positive, but scrollling through the more recent reviews shows a pretty negative trend. Just make the game more unique and fix all the bugs then we wont have any problems.\n\n","October 20, 2015","false","13.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Going by the trailers and screenshots, it looked absolutely amazing. However, going by some of the reviews and the general expectations of most Early Access games, I held off on buying it.\n\nI'm not sure what it was that made me take the risk, but I decided to give it a try.\n\nI have been incredibly pleased with my experience so far. It's all far from finished and that is quite clear, but my word does it have some charm to begin with!\nThe visuals are where it's at for starters. At full settings, It looks stunning! There are some tears and graphical glitches... but when you take in your first sunset, they seem trivial at most.\n\nThe crafting system is a refreshing change to the overused 'Minecraft-esque' table. It feels more physical and you can't carry 64 pieces of wood around in your pocket. Being able to physically drag and move items, really helps immersion and that's the strong point that Stranded Deep should emphasize even more.\n\nThere's basically zero combat, going by my experience so far. I really enjoy this to be honest. I've grown tired of survival games that make you battle fantasy based enemies. I've wanted to play a survival game that pits the player against nature. There isn't enough content to say that Stranded Deep is that game, but it's one of the strongest contenders that I've come across so far. I love that I can hang out on my beach at night time, beside my campfire, as I take in the world around me. I'm not under siege of groaning zombies or trying to take down a T-Rex with a mallet. I'm just watching a tiger shark swim back and forth, as I chuckle quietly... safe from the comfort of my beach.\n\nI do recommend this game BUT... I highly encourage anyone who approaches it, to do so without researching the gameplay too much. I didn't really watch any playthroughs or gameplay footage, before I started. I had no idea how to craft and/or what items were craftable. This gave me a real sense of washing up on a desert island and having to figure things out myself.\nThis game doesn't really hold your hand or walk you through what needs to be done. It's immersive and requires you to pace yourself.\n\nI cannot wait to see Stranded Deep grow into something fantastic. From what I understand, it seems that development has slowed down and some folks are worried that it may go the same road as many other 'open world/survival' Early Access games. I sincerely hope the development continues and generates a bigger following because this could be amazing.\n\n-Pros-\n+ Stunning Visuals / Lighting\n+ Immersive Crafting System\n+ Player defined pacing and progression\n+ Sharks are scary\n+ Fresh and interesting take on survival games\n++++ NO ZOMBIES!!!\n\n-Cons-\n- Visuals need some care (Graphic tears, Draw distance is annoying, Lighting glitches)\n- Needs more content\n- Audio feels unfinished and empty at times\n- Needs more content\n- Slow development\n- Needs more content","July 16, 2015","true","8.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","1"

However, I do have some critiques.\n\n-Footstep sounds are way too heavy and overpowers the rest of the sound almost obnoxiously. Also, the sound of the footsteps doesn't match up with the actual visuals.\n-Ocean mechanics when rafting are almost nauseating. I don't want to have to go to other islands, because of how disorienting they can be.\n-Game crashes/Doesn't pop back up after I alt-tab. This happens on both one monitor and two, on all settings. This is annoying.\n-Some ships have spawned on top of rocks, which makes it nigh impossible to get inside, since it's stuck halfway through the ship.\n\nOverall, aside from those minor issues, I have nothing to complain about, and would recommend the game, since it is in Early Access.

Sorry.\n\nThe game isn't dynamic enough for me. I mean sure, you can chop trees down and build pathetic little huts to put your "valuable" water bottles in, and you can shoot flares and get a chance to get your butt rescued.\n\nBut why the hell can't I chop down the trees with exposed roots, huh? Cuz they have exposed roots? Why the hell can't I build decorative shelves, containers, or other logical objects for building? How am I supposed to satisfy my OCD when I can't put water bottles neatly in a row on a shelf or all of my rocks in a little straw footlocker? Why do I have to pile everything up like a MOFO hoarder?\n\nAlso.\n\nI like how the geography of this game is completely random. One island here, one island there, but where did you get the idea to generate this landscape? Was it the company owner's cheeky freckles? And why did you have to make each island soooo... far... away... from... each other...? It takes for-f**king-ever to piddle-paddle from one gahd-forsaken island to another... and that's BOOORRRING.\n\nYou're just lucky my piece o' crap computer could run it in the first place, or I'd be givin' you a review about how bad you guys optimized this garbage.\n\nI give this game a...\n\n3 / 10.","June 5, 2015","false","1.7"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

I like the crafting system, but I wish you could do something with logs(not just sticks.) I like the stuff you can build so far. Crafting a box that you could put on a raft to carry stuff would be awesome. Maybe even joinging rafts together with lashing? You could have one raft for carrying stuff and one for you.. Or maybe a raft with a sail on it and some wind?\n\nThe sharks are wicked, Except They were swiming under the island and somehow biting me. I also stabbed a tiger shark like 10 times and he wasn't phased. An item I wish I could craft is a harpoon, basically a throwing spear for those sharks.

Im pretty sure I would be able to find some more rocks on the ocean floor at least.

You can make a castaway hut, fire, hunt stuff with a crude spear and theres cool ship wrecks here and there, sometimes with loot and other times without it. I'm still trying to find all the engine peices to see what that can lead to late game. There isn't much of an objective and stuff can glitch out quite a bit. Theres no chest/crate/box to store stuff you find or crafting materials, so you'll find yourself leaving it about in your little hut. But, if you leave to go to another little island sometimes you stuff can fall through the floor and then you cant get to any of it. All in all, I would just say that theres more work that is needed to make it slightly more playable and thats reasonable to say, its only an alpha build.\n\nEdit: Today I realized how amazing this game actually is. And theres one main reason for this. The bucket physics. You can walk into the water and watch the bucket you're holding slowly fill with water and if you set it down but accidentally knock it over you can also watch it slowly drain. This blew me away. 11/10 best game of the year.","January 24, 2015","true","22.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As with many other reviews, lets start with the positives before I move onto the "negatives" (which as this is an Early Access game I would rather think of them as "Suggestions for Improvement". But before I begin, I want to mention an old book now that is probably out of print that I read many years ago that felt like this game. It was called "An Island to Oneself" by Tom Neale and was all about a guy who chose to live the Robinson Crusoe life on an island in the Suwarrow (Suvarov) atoll. Basically, he lived in an old Japanese radio shack from WW2 and lived on the island. He had a small boat to travel to different islands in the atoll and took some provisions with him but essentially he was a castaway. It's a great book and could be a great source of inspiration for this game in some aspects.\n\nPositives:\n\nThe world looks really nice, even at this early stage of the development with a lot of detail in certain things.\n\nThe crafting system is different to games like Minecraft, for example, but in my opinion is more thematic and I prefer it as it also feels more realistic.\n\nThe weather effects are pretty good and make things feel more unpredictable.\n\nThe feeling of trying to survive, one day at a time, feels very well done.\n\nNow for some things I would like to see integrated into the game or changed as it grows and develops:\n\nThe islands need to be bigger. I read somewhere (if I recall correctly) that they don't want the players to have a big island but rather a small island that they felt really isolated on. This is fine but the base minimum island needs to be bigger as I think exploration on the starting island should be a big part of the game before you decide to try your luck elsewhere. It could be that sometimes you start on a bigger island and sometimes a much smaller island like the ones in the game at present - that's the luck of the draw and would make each new game feel different.\n\nWhen you do go exploring to another island(s) they are too far away. I would like to see more of an atoll feel, maybe with a couple of islands much further off in the distance which you'd really need to think about before going for it. "Do I have enough water? Will I make it before dark? What if a storm rolls in? What if I get lost and can't find my way back?" etc.\n\nThere could be more variation in the wrecks and other structures. There were numerous islands in the Pacific that the Japanese occupied during WW2 that have since been abandoned but at the time they had bunkers and other installations. It would be great to explore something like this and for it to act as a Shelter 2.0 if you are lucky enough to have one on your island or find one through exploration. Here you could find a bed instead of having to craft one for example. But not every island would have something like this - again the random generation of worlds could suit this "luck". In addition this would also allow you to potentially find weapons - albeit probably in shoddy condition - which could be used to survive. Or perhaps you could use camoflage netting you find to create a fishing net for example. You could find the jerry cans here as well as some radio equipment to ultimately call for help. I don't think the game should have a reliance on firearms but the possibility of finding something more powerful would feel really valuable.\n\nI would also like to see more natural features on the islands like lagoons, waterfalls, caves, dense jungles, etc., to make exploration more interesting. Not all islands would have this and some might have dried up lagoons or saltwater lagoons, flooded versus non-flooded caves etc. Caves could also be another Shelter option. Jungles could hold resources in the form of plants or animals but are also more deadly because of this as some might be poisonous.\n\nAfter the crash I would be awesome to see flotsam that maybe washes up periodically over time, encouraging you to sweep the shoreline regularly for that lucky find (as in the film "Castaway" when Tom Hanks finds the ice skates and makes an axe). Also, what washes up can be washed away again so you need to be quick to scavenge. This device could also allow you to acquire a backpack to store more items or even suitcases to act as lockboxes for your gear on the island and keep things organized. Flotsam could also take on the form of dead passengers. I know this sounds morbid but walking down the beach and suddenly coming across the body of the pilot or another passenger could be really chilling. Maybe they have something on them that can help you or maybe their clothes will provide you with some protection from the elements. On that note, progressive sun tanning over time would be an interesting way to show the advancement of time on the island(s).\n\nAs for the plane itself, it doesn't have to be a Boeing 747 in size but perhaps something a bit bigger than a private jet that has at least a few more passengers. As far as potential future Multiplayer and Co-Op is concerned this device could work really well here from a narrative standpoint: Multiple survivors (limited number per world so it's not too crowded) but scattered throughout the world - are you really alone or is someone else on your island? Or the island you see on the horizon? etc. Imagine coming across another shelter - was it there before (generated by the seed) or is it actually active and the owner is currently away? This could create amazing tension in the game.\n\nI feel that there should be less sharks as shark attacks should feel terrifying and random and crucially without music so it's sudden and unexpected.\n\nMore building options so that each island shelter has it's own feel. Maybe something involving the bigger trees before being cut into sticks or using lashing to create tent-like shelters or bivouac's etc. Basically more options - why not use a washed up wreck or a cave as a starting point for a shelter? and so on.\n\nThe loot options need to make more sense thematically. I don't mind finding a compass or an air tank on a boat but antibiotics seems odd. These things could be inside luggage that washes up onshore (RE flotsam comments earlier). Here you could also incorporate things like sewing kits, scissors, bottled water etc., all from the passengers luggage.\n\nSticky buttons. I don't want to have to click each time I paddle. I know it might be more realistic for some but I want to press and hold and the character keep paddling.\n\nMore survival options. Making rain catchers, fishing traps & lures etc., using a piece of glass (perhaps from a washed up pair of spectacles) or two sticks to light a fire. Maybe part of the random generation could be that not everyone is fortunate enough to start with a lighter.\n\nA diary to log your thoughts and experiences. I think it's a great optional addition for players that want to document their days surviving. If you don't want to then fair enough - don't bother but the option to do so could be fun. Imagine that a copy is always generated by your shelter so that if somebody else came across your "base" then they could read what you had done.\n\nA map of the island(s) discovered is essential. I would not want some Google Earth style map but a scrap of paper (possibly part of the diary mentioned above) that has penciled-in island outlines as you discover them. Almost like a "fog of war" aspect in other games where it remains unknown until discovered. Also a penciled "X" showing where you are would be great. Exploring islands at present is pretty tedious and frustrating when you can't find your way back and all the islands look the same - even when using the binoculars.","January 31, 2015","true","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

The basic gameplay is extremely addictive and once they flesh out the crafting, add more map variety and weather danger--, and improve and diversify predator threats this game will offer even more.\n\nFor a comparison, it's a bit of a hybrid The Forest and of The Long Dark.   You can craft a basic shelter and other tools but you also have to venture out among the sharks to get the good loot.\n\nInitial complaints are of course bugs and general lack of content.    As it is, as of the initial release, it's well worth the $15 to be a part of what already is a fun adventure.  As with any EA game, it's important to remember this is far from a finished product and in fact it may never be a finished project.

Read at your own risk. lol\n\nStranded Deep is a really dope alpha. The graphics are awesome. The dragging items around is cool. I can't wait until this game is finished! I like the crafting system, but I wish you could do something with logs(not just sticks.) I like the stuff you can build so far. Crafting a box that you could put on a raft to carry stuff would be awesome. Maybe even joinging rafts together with lashing? You could have one raft for carrying stuff and one for you.. Or maybe a raft with a sail on it and some wind?\n\nThe sharks are wicked, Except They were swiming under the island and somehow biting me. I also stabbed a tiger shark like 10 times and he wasn't phased. An item I wish I could craft is a harpoon, basically a throwing spear for those sharks. I'd like to see the sharks bleed when I spear them. It makes a sound when I spear them but thats about it. Im not sure if it was doing anything. Did I give up too soon at 10 spear attacks? lol..\n\nChopping a drinkable coconut with an axe should make a sound.\n\nThe shipwrecks are awesome, but I got stuck inside one. I had a bad feeling about going inside there lol... I'm not sure if it's meant to be a sick joke or if it's just not finsihed. I noticed their was a ladder on the floor but I couldn't pick it up.\n\nThe ammount of rocks on each island is a bit rediculous. Im pretty sure I would be able to find some more rocks on the ocean floor at least. The cooking time is a bit much and you can't ever get enough rocks on your starting island to build a firepit with a cooking rack. So you have to travel to other islands a lot if you want to keep your sanity by not holding food over a fire all night. When is a guy going to find time to sleep? lol..\n\nPaddling is cool, if you could paddle left and right handed with left and right mouse buttons it would be even cooler.\n\nI tried to collect some rain with my bucket but I couldnt. I know it said something about boiling sea water, but theres no way to collect steam so why would I do that? Im pretty sure salt would stay in the bucket.\n\nSome more sea creatures would be cool, maybe some islands could have a few animals on land? Reptiles? Birds? Then maybe skinning sharks and reptiles?\n\nMulti Story structures would be cool.\n\nMultiplayer would be nice as well. If you and your homies started out on the same airplane before it crashed, it would all make sense. Then you could even step it up and have character customization. Maybe the passangers could be scattered on different starting islands and meet up later and Start a little village of stranded survivors? lol\n\nThis is all just constructive critisism. I love the game so far and I know its just an alpha.  I've played it for 10 hours and I still want to see what else I can find in the ship wrecks. I won't be going inside any more holds though. lol.. Maybe I could drop a bunch of logs in there first to jump on to get out? I will also be building my shelter higher up to keep away from those pesky land swimming tiger sharks.  I reccomend buying this game, but you have to understand its not finished. You might want to wait til they improve it a bit. It is fun as it is though.\n\nIf you're like me and you like figuring ♥♥♥♥ out on your own istead of looking up things on wikipedia, the crafting sytem might drive you crazy when you're moving logs around trying to figure out how to use them. You can't. It's all about the sticks.\n\nThe game is awesome, but not complete.\n","January 25, 2015","true","72.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

But i figured id write a quick review.......Let me first start of by saying im absolutely terrified by sharks..... I wont even go into the ocean. So im not sure what exactly made me buy this game.( not that i regret it.) You know when you are in the shower and when you are washing the shampoo out of your hair that feeling you get like something or someone is right there and you gotta hurry to get the soap out of your eyes? I get that feeling every time i get in the water on this game. I decided well hell ill avoid searching the sunken boats and what not for right now and ill just stay in my comfortable raft and go check out this other island. I decided to go to the island that was furthest away from me.....about halfway to it it gets nighttime and it gets reallly spooky I see this fin up ahead of me and it looks HUUGGEE. Even in the confines of my nice secure raft i feel terror......two tiger sharks approach me and i stop paddleing hoping if i stay absoluetely still they will go away...........THAT WAS NOT THE CASE!!!! Im looking at the shark approach my liferaft and im thinking god thats huge. Im glad im in this raft and what does that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tiger shark do? he bumps my raft and i fall out ( i hate to say it but as i went under i screamed like a little girl) struggleing to figure out which way is up. I make it to the surface and my raft is like 50 feet away i start swimming and my screen flashes red and the water starts gettin bloody. Im about 10 feet from my raft now absolutely freaking out as i get ripped apart by two tiger sharks. I had to take a break and go smoke a cig before writing this. Now im going to start my tom hanks simulator again...\n\n1000/10 would be terrified in the dark water by sharks again.","January 30, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The crafting menu is archaic and very limited on what can be built. Why the h#ll do I need to waste resources to build a bed so I can sleep? Can't I just sleep on the ground? Would like to see some simpler shelters added to game. Dont need to build a mansion to survive. Give me a simple A-frame from sticks and palm frounds and I'm good to go. Plus why can't I put the bed inside of the mansion I just built. If I gotta sleep outside then why waste time building it in the first place. Plus seems like you do alot of island hopping to find items. While traveling to other islands you fall out of the raft for no reason at all. Found a bunch of cool loot (carberatur, gas tank, lantern, hammer, axe) couldn't take it with me. Loaded up the raft got ready to head out and boom everything exploded/gliched out of raft onto the beach. Got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and left it all there. Explored to another island found a beached ship climbed up on deck and fell through a closed hatch. Closed hatch remind you. Inside of the ships hull is alot of useful items. Gathered them up put em on a pile added a bunch to inventory (thinking I was a rich man again!). And then couldn't climb out of the ships hull, I jumped around trying to get out couldn't do it. Finally gave up and quit playing. This game has the potential to be a good one. Things I like to see added/changed, less tool deterioration especially for modern tools you find and use, simple shelters that dont waste limited resources, crafting menu that shows what can be made and resources needed to make said items, some form of map making so you can track where you have been, larger islands to home base out of and then explore smaller ones to find goods, a way to cache found/made items (instead of just throwing them on the ground), and get rid of the making a bed to sleep deal. I'll check back periodically to see if game gets updated. But looking forward to see if the full potential of game gets established. 4/10 so far.","January 30, 2015","true","71.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I thought after first playing it how smooth and detailed the game was, the graphics were outstanding and very high definition all of this praise just for a early access game.\n\nGraphics : 9/10 - The graphics were very detailed either on shore or in the sea. It always had a realistic look or appearance. The animals have a amazing animation system aswell as the wind on the trees.\n\nProgramming ; 7/10 - The programming of the game is quite good but there were some flaws when it came to jumping to island to island on a palm tree or items falling through your house. The HUD and GUI is quite rare as you have to check  your watch for your vitals and also if you get stung by a venomous animal your arm gets spotty. The building system and crafting system is great and is not like any other game, you have to place items on the ground to craft them.\n\nContent ; 4/10 - You have to bear in mind that the work put into the game is quite astounding and the developers releasing updates in under 2 weeks. The content is quite low as in there aren't as much things to do and not large islands to fully explore yet but i'm hoping that they add more stuff relatively soon.\n\nMy overall rating for this game is 8/10","February 15, 2015","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As with many other reviews, lets start with the positives before I move onto the "negatives" (which as this is an Early Access game I would rather think of them as "Suggestions for Improvement". But before I begin, I want to mention an old book now that is probably out of print that I read many years ago that felt like this game. It was called "An Island to Oneself" by Tom Neale and was all about a guy who chose to live the Robinson Crusoe life on an island in the Suwarrow (Suvarov) atoll. Basically, he lived in an old Japanese radio shack from WW2 and lived on the island. He had a small boat to travel to different islands in the atoll and took some provisions with him but essentially he was a castaway. It's a great book and could be a great source of inspiration for this game in some aspects.\n\nPositives:\n\nThe world looks really nice, even at this early stage of the development with a lot of detail in certain things.\n\nThe crafting system is different to games like Minecraft, for example, but in my opinion is more thematic and I prefer it as it also feels more realistic.\n\nThe weather effects are pretty good and make things feel more unpredictable.\n\nThe feeling of trying to survive, one day at a time, feels very well done.\n\nNow for some things I would like to see integrated into the game or changed as it grows and develops:\n\nThe islands need to be bigger. I read somewhere (if I recall correctly) that they don't want the players to have a big island but rather a small island that they felt really isolated on. This is fine but the base minimum island needs to be bigger as I think exploration on the starting island should be a big part of the game before you decide to try your luck elsewhere. It could be that sometimes you start on a bigger island and sometimes a much smaller island like the ones in the game at present - that's the luck of the draw and would make each new game feel different.\n\nWhen you do go exploring to another island(s) they are too far away. I would like to see more of an atoll feel, maybe with a couple of islands much further off in the distance which you'd really need to think about before going for it. "Do I have enough water? Will I make it before dark? What if a storm rolls in? What if I get lost and can't find my way back?" etc.\n\nThere could be more variation in the wrecks and other structures. There were numerous islands in the Pacific that the Japanese occupied during WW2 that have since been abandoned but at the time they had bunkers and other installations. It would be great to explore something like this and for it to act as a Shelter 2.0 if you are lucky enough to have one on your island or find one through exploration. Here you could find a bed instead of having to craft one for example. But not every island would have something like this - again the random generation of worlds could suit this "luck". In addition this would also allow you to potentially find weapons - albeit probably in shoddy condition - which could be used to survive. Or perhaps you could use camoflage netting you find to create a fishing net for example. You could find the jerry cans here as well as some radio equipment to ultimately call for help. I don't think the game should have a reliance on firearms but the possibility of finding something more powerful would feel really valuable.\n\nI would also like to see more natural features on the islands like lagoons, waterfalls, caves, dense jungles, etc., to make exploration more interesting. Not all islands would have this and some might have dried up lagoons or saltwater lagoons, flooded versus non-flooded caves etc. Caves could also be another Shelter option. Jungles could hold resources in the form of plants or animals but are also more deadly because of this as some might be poisonous.\n\nAfter the crash I would be awesome to see flotsam that maybe washes up periodically over time, encouraging you to sweep the shoreline regularly for that lucky find (as in the film "Castaway" when Tom Hanks finds the ice skates and makes an axe). Also, what washes up can be washed away again so you need to be quick to scavenge. This device could also allow you to acquire a backpack to store more items or even suitcases to act as lockboxes for your gear on the island and keep things organized. Flotsam could also take on the form of dead passengers. I know this sounds morbid but walking down the beach and suddenly coming across the body of the pilot or another passenger could be really chilling. Maybe they have something on them that can help you or maybe their clothes will provide you with some protection from the elements. On that note, progressive sun tanning over time would be an interesting way to show the advancement of time on the island(s).\n\nAs for the plane itself, it doesn't have to be a Boeing 747 in size but perhaps something a bit bigger than a private jet that has at least a few more passengers. As far as potential future Multiplayer and Co-Op is concerned this device could work really well here from a narrative standpoint: Multiple survivors (limited number per world so it's not too crowded) but scattered throughout the world - are you really alone or is someone else on your island? Or the island you see on the horizon? etc. Imagine coming across another shelter - was it there before (generated by the seed) or is it actually active and the owner is currently away? This could create amazing tension in the game.\n\nI feel that there should be less sharks as shark attacks should feel terrifying and random and crucially without music so it's sudden and unexpected.\n\nMore building options so that each island shelter has it's own feel. Maybe something involving the bigger trees before being cut into sticks or using lashing to create tent-like shelters or bivouac's etc. Basically more options - why not use a washed up wreck or a cave as a starting point for a shelter? and so on.\n\nThe loot options need to make more sense thematically. I don't mind finding a compass or an air tank on a boat but antibiotics seems odd. These things could be inside luggage that washes up onshore (RE flotsam comments earlier). Here you could also incorporate things like sewing kits, scissors, bottled water etc., all from the passengers luggage.\n\nSticky buttons. I don't want to have to click each time I paddle. I know it might be more realistic for some but I want to press and hold and the character keep paddling.\n\nMore survival options. Making rain catchers, fishing traps & lures etc., using a piece of glass (perhaps from a washed up pair of spectacles) or two sticks to light a fire. Maybe part of the random generation could be that not everyone is fortunate enough to start with a lighter.\n\nA diary to log your thoughts and experiences. I think it's a great optional addition for players that want to document their days surviving. If you don't want to then fair enough - don't bother but the option to do so could be fun. Imagine that a copy is always generated by your shelter so that if somebody else came across your "base" then they could read what you had done.\n\nA map of the island(s) discovered is essential. I would not want some Google Earth style map but a scrap of paper (possibly part of the diary mentioned above) that has penciled-in island outlines as you discover them. Almost like a "fog of war" aspect in other games where it remains unknown until discovered. Also a penciled "X" showing where you are would be great. Exploring islands at present is pretty tedious and frustrating when you can't find your way back and all the islands look the same - even when using the binoculars.","January 31, 2015","true","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Surviving is easy, chop down trees then chop them up for wood and leaves, cut yuccas for ropes, collect rocks. Make a bed, a fire, an axe, harvest and collect potatos, and coconuts. Paddle to other islands for supplies when needed. Build a hut, Upgrade your fire so you can cook crabs. Stock food and water in your hut, go exploring and diving wrecks for supples. Avoid sharks. Find motor parts and fuel can and put a motor or motors on a wooden raft. Explore more, find flares and flare guns, torches, axes, machetes and more..\n\nALPHA release with bugs, however if you can ignore a whale swimming through your island and knocking your coconuts and other important items  everywhere, or getting stuck in a wreck with no stairs out of the hatch.. or silly little unimportant bugs, you'll probably really enjoy this game. It'd be nice if islands weren't quite so far apart, and if there was an in game map you could add locations to with compass manually, or set it to auto, etc etc.. but this game is really fun if you want to put yourself in this situation starting with basically nothing, and building your island paradise...\n\nI was happy when I read it is developed by a couple of Aussies :) glad I supported it.. the devs appear to be good at their job and have lots of good ideas suggested or their own ideas that they are considering and or already working on.

Well, it does fulfill these promises, however it isn't exactly content filled at the moment, which is understandable considering I am writing this review at Alpha v0.02. It is fun building your own houses and fire pits with an original and well done crafting system. With that said, there are still quite a few bugs in the game that stop me properly enjoying it. Whilst there isn't a huge variety of animals at the moment it is great diving down to the deep with a torch, exploring and discovering the types of marine wildlife that you can find there. That said, there are a few annoying points. One of them is the bleeding debuff, this will be given to you if you get bitten by one of the two sharks in the game, a Tiger Shark or a Great White. It deals about .15% damage to health every second and whilst you will be able to survive for a very long time, you wont be able to get rid of it without finding two very rare items, only found at the bottom of the sea in shipwrecks, to craft a bandage to cancel the debuff. Whilst this is annoying, you can get around it by... not poking the shark with an axe. Yeah.\n\nPositive\n+ Graphics\n+ Original Crafting System\n+ Interesting wildlife\n+ Dedicated developers\n\nNegative\n- Light on Content\n\nConclusionStranded Deep is a slightly buggy, but beautiful experience but there isn't a huge amount of content to be enjoyed yet, however it has a dedicated team of developers who are issuing regular updates!","February 19, 2015","true","9.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So, now lets get to the actualy review. Since this game is still in Early Access, sure, there are numerous numbers of bugs, some that will ruin the game if not fix. But we do have to keep in mind that this is Early Access. At the moment, this game is playable, and you will have fun. Sometimes, like mentioned, you will encounter some bugs, which can sometimes kill you. However, I see the huge potential of this game. This game brings fantastic gameplay, with beautiful graphics and realism. Below, I wil be listing a few bugs I have personally encountered, along with things I would like to see added into the game, as I believe this games potential is just crazy.\n\nBugs:\n\n- What I call the "Land Shark." Sharks seem to go through everything, even if it is supposed to be impassable.\n- Rafts and lifeboats sometimes dissapear after re-log. This has been a HUGE problem for me once. I was deep into the game, with quite a lot of days survived, when I save the game during rafting. I then quit the game.  Later on, I re-log, finding myself in the middle of the night and ocean, raft-less, surrounded by great whites and eventually, I was devoured.\n\nThere are probably a lot more bugs, but these are the only bugs I have personally encountered.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n- New creatures added in to the game\n- SQUISH THOSE GOD DAMN BUGS!\n- More craftable things\n- Character customization\n- Multiplayer\n- Co-op\n- More ways of transportation\n- More species of trees and plants\n- If multiplayer/co-op does come, costumes/clothing would be cool\n- More tools?\n- Weapons, the only weapon like tool is the spear, which is used for hunting, actualy weapons that can be used for fighting would be cool\n- An end to the game (but keep endless, some people would still want to play endless)\n- DLC's?\n- More variety to the things I can build\n\nThank you to you, for reading my guide. Please rate it helpful, so the creators can see this and further increase their progress and reach the game's full potential.\n\nThanks to you all :)","January 27, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's similar to "Salt" (another game presently on Steam's Early Access program), albeit prettier and thus nicer to look at.  There's no handholding and barely a tutorial to help you get acclimated to what you need to do to survive.  This can be a positive or negative, depending on how you like your survival games to be.

So, i can't really compare it to other similar games but just on what I have seen during my own playtime and watching lets plays videos. I think the games visuals are stunning, even on lower settings they're very pleasing to the eye. I think the game mechanics are good despite various bugs (to be expected in Alpha stage)  and love not having a HUD and menus.\n\nFor future development I see lots of discussion over bigger islands and coop. Having seen coop on the development road map I was very happy as I feel coop is what made minecraft what it is and could help SD do the same. However, im torn over the idea of bigger islands. I would however like to see some islands closer together rather than all the islands being spread equal distance apart. Perhaps lots of small islands in close distance and some bigger islands further away, maybe even out of view on the horizon, giving you that truly deserted feeling where you dont know where your direction will take you?\n\nAlso, is it possible to find the plane wreckage?","February 5, 2015","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You are a person riding a plane when your plane suddenly crashes into the ocean.Then you get a raft and paddle and swim away.Just like cast away. Then you paddle to an island and try to survive. The game is cool considering it's easter eggs, but I don't want to spoil them. The game isn't that hard. The only threats are dehydration, starving, and sharks, and if your stupid and swim to the bottom of the ocean .... drowning. Not much. Food..... you have crabs all over the island you can cook, you have coconuts after you drink out of it, and potatoes, and fish. Food is an easy one. dehydration a little bit harder, all you need is a coconut or get a bucket and fill it up with water, then boil it on a fire spit just like the food. Sharks, stay out of water, stay on raft, or island. Drowning, be smart.

You start out with a paddle, a raft, a lighter, a pocket knife and a watch that tells you your health and hunger (because why not).\n\nThis game is very fun, but very hard as well. There are Shipwrecks which have lots of useful items, but you need to be\ncareful, becuase you have limited oxygen and there is the possibility of sharks spawning, and they attack on sight.\n\nOverall, this is a great survival game.

Stranded Deep has the potential to be one of the greatest open world survival games ever created, with only 2 developers and a stack full of cash I hope they sink it ino the game and get a decent development team.\n\nStranded Deep Playthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSCuoJxx0Gs&list=PLQXxdMEVsVZc8ZVfCPklmhL0_FVWdOWba&index=1","July 10, 2015","true","106.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The whole carribean island setting is just amazing. Also the underwater-world is super detailed and beautiful. I haven't seen a game looking this good very often, especially when it's an early access alpha game.\n\nYou play a lone survivor stranded after a plane crash on the ocean. After landing on the first island with your life-raft, you have to do, what every survivor has to do in this situation: find water, find food, build a shelter, make a fire. You will find lots of resources to achieve your goals. Also you can search in the water for useful stuff, dive down and maybe you'll find a shipwreck and discover a real treasure (no gold). And of course you can also paddle to other islands around you, there are dozens of them, BUT watch out for the hungry SHARKS! They will overturn your raft (if you're lucky enough) and then you have real problems! Better get back on the raft ASAP!\n\nIn my current game (6,5 h) I survived for 9 days so far, found lots of food (crabbes, fish, potatoes, coconuts), crafted some tools, started to build a house and a bed and checked out a few islands.  I even got my raft flipped over by a shark (almost ♥♥♥♥ my pants), but was fast enough back on there.\nAnd I still have to learn things to survive longer, there is just so much do discover already. Because in this game you have to find out everything yourself, there are no plans of how to craft this or that, you have to try it out, what I find pretty cool, just put every craftable item on a stack and see, what you can do.\nSame with the exploring, just keep your eyes open for everything useful on land and in the water. I think, I still haven't seen all of this game yet, but I am very impressed so far!\n\nI actually can't understand people, who rate this game negative, just because it's an alpha version and because there is so much work to do. People, it's an early access alpha build, just v 0.02, that means, the game is not finished and the developers want YOU to try the game and help them with the developing process by telling them what you like and what you would like to see in this game, report bugs and stuff! If you like the game so far, but think, it needs some work, than SAY IT, you can rate it positive AND say, what you don't like!\n\nMy conclusion: This game ist just amazing, very nice concept, great graphics and lots of things to do and to discover so far, even in this early stage. I bet, when it continues getting updated regularly, than this one will probably become the best survival game in gaming history, even if it takes a lot of time! I will wait for it!\nAnd the 15 bucks for this game are well invested, because you will get everything that's still to come for free, a finished game of this kind will cost you at least 30 bucks! Actually, just the beauty of this game is worth the purchase!","March 5, 2015","true","16.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There wasn't much crafting if any at all, you started out with essentials instead of having to find them scattered around, and frankly it was very choppy all around.\n\nNow, that was several months ago.

The maker(s) of this game could or should use real life as inspiration for the game. The beginning of the game is decent but the player has little to no things to do before the plane crashes. Maybe they could add a layer or two of emotion to the game. Give the player the ability to talk in the beginning with his family on his cell phone and after he hangs up thats when the airplane goes down. Maybe even show the flight attedant get sucked out of the plane. The player should have more options for your floatation device after hitting the water. With the right coding and programmimg from the right people with expertise, this game could be the ultimate survival game. The infinite lighter and flashlight don't exist but not in Stranded Deep. You could have an option to make time even slower in the game. Slowing it down by half or quarter. When you first land on your first island there should be random wreckage from your plane with random items to help you survive in the beginning. Gathering those itmes for later use. I.E. water bottles, medical stuff, and especially food (Airline food). There should also be a desperation mode. When your gauge reaches a certain level of being deprived you start to open up more options for foods and liquids. Because once the game updates and adds animals, bugs, and critters, etc... you should only be able to eat them when your level of desperation is high enough. Because if you think about it, why would a person go automatically to eating rats and roaches and bugs when they only got to a secluded island. When you have actual rations you could eat first. Now say its day 5 or 10 and you are low on rations. Your deprive mode bumps up a notch and your menu opens up options to drink shark blood or eat food raw. This bypassing the need to cook stuff when you are clearly unable to because you are too far from the island you had all your stuff on. Another idea( since there are thousands of randomly Generated  boat wrecks.) When not give the player the ability to scrap the boat wood and materials to remove and carry to the island and to use for building things. There are many things updates can do to improve the game but these are just a few.","May 29","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is a step towards being an actual game and the devs seem to be making quite an effort into making this a great survival game. I want to be clear that i have played this game in offline mode for hours, and done everything there is to do. As I have said- Not much to do here yet but there is progress, and progress is the key to success. This game is fun to play as of now, but the fun only lasts for a few minutes. The continuing updates will ensure that this game will one day be superior.\n\nOriginal review: Ok, Im sure the team behind this game worked hard on it, because it shows. Impressive graphics and a great opening sequence prove this. I hate to give a negative review on any game, as it takes a lot of time, dedication and hard work to create one. But I also want to  warn anyone out there to be wary of purchasing this game, and invite you read my review please. I also will answer any questions you have.\n"Early Access" is no excuse for this.  I read a lot of  reviews for this game before buying it, All of which were positive, encouraging anyone who likes survival or open world exploration to get the game. Since I like both genres, i decided to give it a try. The beginning of the game starts strong but soon falls flat. I begin the game in a plane, mixing a cocktail beverage only to soon find the plane diving to the ocean. I plunge into the water and then swim out of the wreckage and into a conveniently placed life raft. I see a nearby island and slowly row towards it while the wreckage burns and explodes behind me. As if things couldnt get any more dramatic, a shark circles my raft. I scramble to reach the land, jumping out of the raft and running through the shallows as the shark gives up his chase. I was very excited to get started on my survival quest. The game doesnt hold hands, (Which I like). With no directions or hint on what to do, I soon find an axe and make a fire and shelter and I kill some crabs to eat. I decide to brave the shark infested waters and scavenge the nearby sailboat and plane ruins underwater. I come back up to the surface(With my non-upgradable inventory of 8 slots full) and decide to tinker on my island a bit more before nightfall. But then I find that I have depleted all of the resources on my small island. By small i mean around 50x70 meters. When morning comes, I embark on a journey with my raft full of my collected trinkets and find that my raft moves very slow loaded down so i throw most everything overboard (assuming I will find a large island containing more trinkets) and head to a nearby visible island.\n\nThis game sounds pretty good as of now, Doesnt it? If my review stopped here, Im sure you would buy it. But this is where I insist you wait until after the game is finished to buy it.\nAs I reach the next island, I am confused as to why it is a cookie-cut replica of the previous island. A few new sticks to grab, new rocks to sharpen but its the same size and nothing of interest is found other than some binoculors in a nearby box. I try to look through them only to find that my character peers over the top of them instead and the view is only magnified by about  2x. I  somehow happen to spot another island, however, so I head to it. When I arrive, I notice, to my surpise, another replicated, small island with a few more rocks and sticks. No new ruins, No enemies, no caves or landmarks. I play on, surviving, eating, sitting around fires at night, and "exploring" during the day only to find more replicated 50x70 meter islands. Nothing new, no land-based enemies or new tools. A quick search of a guide shows that there are around 15 craftable items, A shark as the only real enemy and nothing I didnt find in 25 minutes of gameplay. You can however, build a boat motor and raft and use it to "explore" More hollow, small, replicated islands and "survive".\n\nIf you are a normal human and want to play an early access survival game, try "The Long Dark". It is a survival game done right, And has many more places to explore and things to do. If however, you are a well behaved (and well used) aching prisoner, or a slave locked away in a dungeon, yet have access to Steam, You could play "Stranded Deep" to kill time in between your torture sessions and reamings. Not much to do or see here quite yet, unfortunately.","March 2, 2015","false","1.0"," 185 of 361 people (51%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","51","185","361","27","41"

Usually their Is tons of bugs and glitches around the game but I have only seen 2 In my play time. These bugs were not major either, but they consisted of 'Menu Glitching for a few seconds' and 'Not being able to drop or pick up Items for a couple seconds'. I can say with confidence that this game Is the most well made early access games on steam at the moment. Next I want to touch up on the 'Crafting System'. This system is very unique, when placing down Items that are craftable on the ground, holding left click on the item/items, dragging your mouse away from the item, and clicking which Item you want to craft It Into. Very unique system that I have yet to see In any game that I have played. Most games that you drop Items In are usually a bit annoying but this one Is very smooth and your items don't roll all over the place when dropped like most games. Gathering Items Is a bit tricky but fun and exciting at the same time. Wether your collecting Items on your Island such as sticks, rocks, rope, etc or your swimming In the ocean under water collecting Items from a abandon ship while sharks attack you. (Which I might add Is a adrenaline rush like no other) It's very entertaining and enjoyable. One other thing I would quickly like to touch on Is the sound. Now don't get me wrong, I love the sound of the ocean In the morning and night just like anyone else. But I would love If they adjusted the sound just a tad bit. Maybe more options for other sounds to turn down. Also, the audio needs to be adjusted a bit as when I put the game to low volume, It still was very loud. But this will be fixed eventually. The last thing I want to touch up on about Is the graphics. These graphics for early access are pretty damn good. I don't they hit they're full potential but they are very enjoyable at 1080p, Ultra settings. They could use some work but they are very, very beautiful and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic. But at the moment they're is some stuff to do that will entertain you for a couple hours, but the game will get boring after that and you will switch. Hopefully they add more things to do In the game In the near future, Instead of just build 24/7.\n\nControls: 8.5/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nSound: 7/10\nOverall: 8/10 (For early access at the date of 1/28/14 7:40PM)","January 28, 2015","true","3.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

WOW. This game had me glued to the computer for 6 hours straight scratching for survival on a handful of desert islands.\n\nThe good:\n1. Gorgeous graphics and atmosphere.\n2. Crafting and scavenging to save your life.\n3. Refreshing simplicity all thorughout this game.\n4. The feeling of sheer gratitude when you find crabs.\n\nThe bad:\n1. Achievements are not being counted.\n2. Sharks defy phisics from time to time. (i.e. I had one fly out of the ocean and bite me on top of a beached ship.)\n3. There is an end point where you have everything that you need to survive. Like all other survival games, this one gets to a point where there is nothing more to do but grind away and the challenge is gone.\n\nMy only suggestion to the developers: Give me a final task to work towards and keep me engaged. Some way to build and stock a canoe, or build a signal beacon from the crashed ships or something to give completion. I would love nothing more than to fight like mad to survive, then revel in the feeling of being pulled onto some Chinese freighter or Australian sea-plane or something.\n\nOh, and the ability to throw that badass spear I made.\n\n----------\n\nWhat happened:\nMy plane crashed at night. Woke up the next day and paddled to a nearby island. There was nothing there but some Yucca and two coconuts. How am I supposed to survive on this?? I used my pocket knife (how did I get this onto a plane anyway, not to mention the lighter?) to chow down on the coconuts, but it did little to help. Okay, so there's nothing else here that I can use, and my knife isn't working so well with fishing. I see another island in the distance and start paddling again.\n\nMore coconuts and Yucca. This one has a rock, and some sticks. I fashion myself a spear and begin attacking sardines. It helps, but water is running short and these puny fish are not satiating my appetite in the least. I need to find something more. The ruined ships here have some bandages and an engine. I don't need an engine, unless it comes with a full boat or wings attached... What I wouldn't give for a cigarette. Wish I had saved that pack from the plane. My watch is beeping. Maybe I shouldn't have bought this survival watch, it seems to just overshadow how quickly my death is approaching.\n\nOn the verge of starvation and dehydration, I need to find an island with something I can use! There are sharks now, and some creepy music, but it's braving the water or death. I take my chances in the little rubber raft and paddle furiously to the next island. The sun is going down, paddle faster. This damned tiger shark won't leave the raft alone. Sometime after sunset, I'm thrown from the raft and grabbed by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I stab at it furiously with my knife and it eventually lets go. The raft is not far, so I swim back, bleeding furiously. Back to paddling. More bumps, but I'm getting better at holding on. I finally make land on the rocks; bleeding, starving and parched. The moon is huge, and bright, and by it's light I find my way into the main island.\n\nPotatoes! And coconuts by the dozen! I begin slaking my thirst, slap a bandage on and munch down some potatoes. It's a long night, but as the most beautiful sunrise lights the sky, I find a huge colony (is that the right word) of crabs here! I gratefully munched on them, got a little sick but that passed. A little bit of exploring reveals a machete and a bucket in a wrecked ship. I used my bucket to boil down some fresh water, which seems more sustainable than scouring coconuts from the many islands of the pacific. The crabs are breeding too, which looks like a good source of food that I can continue to use. I'm saved! For now...\n\nMy next task is to create shelter. I fashion a sad little bed and upgrade my fire to cook food without me holding it there. The small conveniences of life make it worth living, I think. A couple of trips to other islands and I've chopped down enough trees, gathered enough fronds and rope, and scaveneged enough rocks to continue building my shelter. It seems the survival raft has a weight limit, and tends to sink when you load 12 rocks into it. Multiple trips later, I've gotten a little hut with a door in which I can sleep at night and wake to a beautiful sunrise out my window. Don't people pay good money for this anywhere else?\n\nSo now that I'm settled into a routine for survival, a friend comes up to visit me. A friendly tiger shark begins circling the waters around my small atoll, bothering my crabs. Of course, I don't want to compete with a shark for a sustainable crustatian food source, so out comes the machete and into the water I go. Bob (the shark) is rude enough to bite at me in my own home! To hell with bob!

So $15 for something that gives me hours of fun is $15 well invested, especially considering the potential that this game has.\n\nAfter buying the game, I was pleasantly surprised at the small file size of the game download (~400mb), so downloaded it immediately.\n\nWhen I started playing, I had already read from some reviews that the sharks don't actually attack the player, and this kind of made me feel a little disappointment, as I wasn't really that scared of going in the water....at least until I was in the water, diving down into a ship-wreck to salvage any goodies that I could salvage, then, despite having read that sharks don't attack, I was starting to panic a little.\nThank goodness, I was not attacked, thus I felt that what I read, was confirmed, and these sharks weren't your typical every day survival game monster that is craving your blood or brains.\n\nSo I proceeded towards the shore of a nearby island, impressed that to move my little raft, I had to first pick-up the paddle inside of it, but I had to click to use the paddle in the water and move forward towards the shore.\nOnce I was on shore, I found that I could drag my raft, so proceeded to do so, making sure that the raft does not drift away while i'm not watching or something, not that it mattered, because I could just swim out to it and not be fearful of death by shark. :)\n\nSo I gathered some stuff, built some stuff, gathered more stuff, killed some crabs, cooked some crabs, and noticed that there was some bubbling in the water just off the shore. It was too far for me to bother swimming, so after being all fed and ready, I decided to drag my raft to the other side of the little island I was on, and venture to the bubbling, suspecting that it was some kind of give-away that there was treasure to be found at the bottom of the ocean at that location.\nI was not wrong, after having jumped off my raft, swam down to another ship-wreck, finding myself some more commercially made items (rather than my rock axe that I just built).\n\nOn my way up, I saw a shark, and despite me having been convinced that they do not attack, I still felt my heart racing, especially considering how the shark kept circling me and almost seemingly looking at me while doing so...it was creepy.\nEspecially since it was now very dark, almost night-time and it's silhoette was made more apparent from the light shining through the oceans ripples above.\n\nSo I swam towards my little life raft, which I somehow drifted away from, when suddenly, I was pulled under water, blood clouds and all, before I noticed that I had in fact, been grabbed by the great white shark that was circling me, and all I could do was watch as I was being dragged into the depths below, by this point, it was incredibly dark, almost pitch black.\nI scrambled my keyboard for my knife, and so whipped it out and started stabbing the shark in the head....he actually let go, and I was amazed by this. I forgave the game for not messing me up more than the attack should have, and decided to try and swim towards the surface....\nWell, It was REALLY DARK, and my vision was now darker after the attack, so I had no idea which way I was swimming. I eventually caught a glimpse of light glistening through the surface above, I swam up frantically when all of a sudden....I got attacked again, and dragged back down below into the depths, probably for a night time nibble for the sharkies.\n\nAnd with that, it was game over. :(\n\nI was really happy with the shark AI. Most games would just make the shark into some horrifying monster of death that would pursue you like the terminator, but nope, these sharks behaved a little like their real life counter-parts, curiously inspecting you to check you out.\nThe models for the sharks are amazing too, they don't look silly, nor do they look like they are permanantly gritting their teeth with some cheesy sharky smile.\nNot only that, but their animations are fluid and believable, which I guess is what made it so scary to go under-water in the first place.\n\n\nAs for the cons, there is nothing really all that major, other than the shark AI not really reacting properly when the player attacks the sharks, but that wouldn't be hard for the developers to touch on later.\n\nI will let anybody reading this review decide on what is bad and what is not.\n\nBut for an early access game, all of the features in it so far, are really well done, it feels polished, it doesn't feel like i'm playing a pre-alpha, but more like i'm playing a beta version that just needs additional features.\n\nI look forward to where the developers are heading with this game, as I've been waiting for a proper island type survival game ever since I played a game called "Stranded II".\n\nDo I recommend this? Absolutely, buy it!\n\n\n","January 23, 2015","true","7.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

I’ve got a lot to say about this game (most of it unironically good), and some mixed feelings about the state of the game industry as a whole that Stranded Deep sums up in an eerily succinct manner.\n\nSo, first off, this is not some “lol great uninstall simulator” joke thumbs up.  I really do love Stranded Deep.  By pure happenstance, I picked it up just as a big update hit (DO NOT BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WHO SAY THE GAME HAS SLOW DEVELOPMENT, THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT!!  IT TAKES MORE THEN TWELVE HOURS TO BUILD A NEW UPDATE YOU IMPATIENT DOLTS!!) and as of right now, the only major feature that isn’t implemented is the ability to be rescued.  A big thing to add?  Yes.  Necessary to enjoy this game to its fullest?  Depending on what you want out of it, no.  The game as it is now I compare to a more serious and survival oriented version of Minecraft.  Where Minecraft is about building as impressive a shelter as you can (in theory) with a survival edge to it, Stranded Deep lives on the idea of survival with the ability to build a nice bungalow on the beach just for the fun of it.  The comparison isn’t perfect to be sure, but I feel it at least answers some of the problems the critics of this game (who have a leg to stand on) have.  One of the most common complaints I’ve seen is that it lacks content and you shouldn’t spend money on it until it has more.  This is actually not true.  Because the game is so aimless, I’d put money on many of these people building 1-6 foundation blocks for a bare bones shelter, built a fire spit, collected some crabs and coconuts and called it a day.  The problem with that is the vast majority of the content isn’t just underwater, but also spread out over many islands.  Like with Minecraft, if you don’t give yourself something to do, like building a big shelter, collecting all the easter eggs, constructing a boat motor, killing a Great White or Marlin, or any of the other many things you can do here and there, you’re going to spend an hour on the game, get bored and shelf the game.  If that’s the case, open world games aren’t for you, I suppose.  And that’s fine.  Me?  I spent 20 hours gathering the resources to build the shelter I have in my game.  And it was a fun and nerve-racking and immersive and lonely and atmospheric experience that I will never forget.  And I’m not even close to done with that world yet, let alone the game as a whole.  That said though, I read the patch notes on the 0.01 build of the game and that ♥♥♥♥’s inexcusable.  Had the game been released on the 0.03H3 patch when I got it, I’d put it on the short list of games that did early access right.  Then again, Stranded Deep probably wouldn’t have gotten this far had it not been released when it had.  Add in the fact that, with the number of bugs still in the game (though rapidly shrinking), I have basically payed a developer money to playtest his/her late beta game, this whole early access nonsense has yet again put a bad taste in my mouth.  I hate early access so much that my friend (who has the average amount of hate for early access) wants to size me for a straightjacket every time it comes up in conversation, so you can see my issues with the nature of Stranded Deep’s development.\n\nTL;DR: If you like aimless, open world games with no goal, as of right now and forever more, Stranded Deep will NOT disappoint.  It’s deeply immersive, atmospheric, lonely, and even terrifying at times if you fear open water (as I do).  If you need more structure then that, wait for the ability to be rescued to be implemented.  That may or may not give you the goal you need to work toward to give this game the time it needs to capture you fully.  I got it for the full $15 asking price and never once regretted it (sans the whole early access thing).  If you’re smarter than me and wait to get it on sale, all the better.","July 29, 2015","true","54.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I thuroughly enjoy this game... maybe add some elements, like a larger island with more creatures occasionally, and maybe small groups of pirates, or maybe a few npc straddlers that also got lost, but want to kill you, or they turned canabal. One big feature that needs a release is multiplayer. I personally think adding multiplayer sooner would be a big step forward, or at least tide people oveeer with lan or local hosting multiplayer, that others may join online.. if from in game, then have maybe a 4 or 5 player max on lan or online co-op, and later add larger scale multiplayer via creaters server, and open for others to make their own perhaps on their own machine?

I find myself getting lost in the world and trying to do lots of things to improve the life for my character who wakes up with almost nothing and needs your skill and planning to survive.\n\nThe issue I have at the moment is that too much of the game is 'missing' or still 'in development'. I realise this is an early access game and that is the point, which is why I have given the game a thumbs up - for now. It seems there was a change in the way the game was being developed and a lot of things, most notably the crafting system, which is the absolute core of the game, have been taken back to the drawing board.\n\nAs such, after about an hour of gametime, where you survive, learn to feed yourself and make a bed, there is very little in the game to actually do. Sure you can row your liferaft around to other places to explore and pick things up, but you can't currently DO anything with those things. You can look at them, but can't make a power boat or a raft of your own or anything other than the basic constructions afforded to you in the construction menu.\n\nMy biggest concern with the game is - what happens then? If the devs add back in the crafting to make these things... what am I going to do? It's fun learning to survive for an hour or so, but then what? There seems to be a farming thing in development, but I can't see myself coming back to Stranded Deep unless there's more to do. It's a sandbox game, but at the moment the walls of the box are too restricted.\n\nBased on the work that's gone into it so far, I'm encouraged by the dev team and what they are doing. Hopefully my concerns will be allayed and the game will be improved in the new year. It's a great start, but be wary, it's very much 'EARLY' in the early access.","December 25, 2015","true","2.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There's plenty of potential here, and while it is taking longer than I would like, I do see progress being made. That said, there are bugs. Fires stop cooking, you can get stuck in things (especially fire pits), trees used to, but can't be, chopped, the graphics need optimizing before it can run well, and other things.

I’ve got a lot to say about this game (most of it unironically good), and some mixed feelings about the state of the game industry as a whole that Stranded Deep sums up in an eerily succinct manner.\n\nSo, first off, this is not some “lol great uninstall simulator” joke thumbs up.  I really do love Stranded Deep.  By pure happenstance, I picked it up just as a big update hit (DO NOT BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WHO SAY THE GAME HAS SLOW DEVELOPMENT, THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT!!  IT TAKES MORE THEN TWELVE HOURS TO BUILD A NEW UPDATE YOU IMPATIENT DOLTS!!) and as of right now, the only major feature that isn’t implemented is the ability to be rescued.  A big thing to add?  Yes.  Necessary to enjoy this game to its fullest?  Depending on what you want out of it, no.  The game as it is now I compare to a more serious and survival oriented version of Minecraft.  Where Minecraft is about building as impressive a shelter as you can (in theory) with a survival edge to it, Stranded Deep lives on the idea of survival with the ability to build a nice bungalow on the beach just for the fun of it.  The comparison isn’t perfect to be sure, but I feel it at least answers some of the problems the critics of this game (who have a leg to stand on) have.  One of the most common complaints I’ve seen is that it lacks content and you shouldn’t spend money on it until it has more.  This is actually not true.  Because the game is so aimless, I’d put money on many of these people building 1-6 foundation blocks for a bare bones shelter, built a fire spit, collected some crabs and coconuts and called it a day.  The problem with that is the vast majority of the content isn’t just underwater, but also spread out over many islands.  Like with Minecraft, if you don’t give yourself something to do, like building a big shelter, collecting all the easter eggs, constructing a boat motor, killing a Great White or Marlin, or any of the other many things you can do here and there, you’re going to spend an hour on the game, get bored and shelf the game.  If that’s the case, open world games aren’t for you, I suppose.  And that’s fine.  Me?  I spent 20 hours gathering the resources to build the shelter I have in my game.  And it was a fun and nerve-racking and immersive and lonely and atmospheric experience that I will never forget.  And I’m not even close to done with that world yet, let alone the game as a whole.  That said though, I read the patch notes on the 0.01 build of the game and that ♥♥♥♥’s inexcusable.  Had the game been released on the 0.03H3 patch when I got it, I’d put it on the short list of games that did early access right.  Then again, Stranded Deep probably wouldn’t have gotten this far had it not been released when it had.  Add in the fact that, with the number of bugs still in the game (though rapidly shrinking), I have basically payed a developer money to playtest his/her late beta game, this whole early access nonsense has yet again put a bad taste in my mouth.  I hate early access so much that my friend (who has the average amount of hate for early access) wants to size me for a straightjacket every time it comes up in conversation, so you can see my issues with the nature of Stranded Deep’s development.\n\nTL;DR: If you like aimless, open world games with no goal, as of right now and forever more, Stranded Deep will NOT disappoint.  It’s deeply immersive, atmospheric, lonely, and even terrifying at times if you fear open water (as I do).  If you need more structure then that, wait for the ability to be rescued to be implemented.  That may or may not give you the goal you need to work toward to give this game the time it needs to capture you fully.  I got it for the full $15 asking price and never once regretted it (sans the whole early access thing).  If you’re smarter than me and wait to get it on sale, all the better.","July 29, 2015","true","54.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You have your watch, which is able to track your vital signs, and some basic stuff. You take the raft from the plane and find the nearest island. Finally with your feet on land, it hits you! You need to survive and that's not going to happen if you don't take action right away. So start planning. Find food, water and materials to build your island paradise.\n\nYour only enemy is you and nature.\n\nAs you explore the islands, you'll find wrecks of ships and planes. Explore them and go treasure hunting. Not real treasure, gold is of no use on a deserted island. You'll find useful stuff like water bottles, axes and engine parts.\n\nBuild your house, traps for catching fish and learn how to survive using just that what you can find.

Instead of stuck in a map of trees and abandon houses it puts you in a tropical island chain. though it is still EA as much games on steam are. i like the way this game is heading. it really does have potential to be a great game. as for now its maps are  somewhat small. You find yourself quickly surthiving. and if you really want to beat all odds you can create and island that has everything on it in on big pile. and be golden. this part i dont like although i have found myself building islands larger than the ones in the game. cause lets face it they are small.\n\nI do recommend this game\n1. its fun (your kinda in the movie castaway)\n2. they are still very much tweaking the game and working on bug fixes\n3. it has a creator map mode. ( i like building things)\n4. decent crafting menu\n5.  they do eventually (i think) plan on a multiplayer (again i said i think. they mentioned it)","May 10","true","21.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've played 60hrs, ....before the experiment update!\nFor those that say this gets boring, go look for some of the rare items you can find! This game is about staying alive, every single day....as long as possible. (until someday there may be a way out). You will run out of food no matter how much you have stock piled, you will run out of wood, water, tools. So i don't know how you can be bored when there is always something to do to keep yourself going on. Now that the test update is out, it's even harder to go diving for items!! Which is cool, and more life-like in my opinion. Though i do think there would be some calm ocean days in the ocean, but mostly rough as i've experienced so far. For those that don't have a compass, and are already crying about things in the game because of no compass, there is a compass, and it works great! Never lose your home base again! Another rare item i found was a Dead-Ex package,.. (instead of Fed-Ex). Not sure what it all means but it's a mystery so far. Great job on the water update, wish things were moving along a little faster, or at least working more in the new update with the rough ocean. First time trying the experiment update, my raft flipped a shark was attacking me at the same time, waves are crazy, and i'm trying to get back on my raft,.... raft was upside down so had to paddle back as it was to shore, then flip my raft back over once grounded. I like the click and drag movement in this game, many developers could learn a lot from these guys on that! It's so efficent, and when you can't carry any more things, ...just drag one along!","November 2, 2015","true","67.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Mint game. No complaints. It's an early access game, gives you the thrill of new updates and watching is grow into something amazing. The graphics for a 2 dev team (BeamTeam) are supurb. The realism is improving constently. The environment (trees, shrubs, animals ect) is fantastic and getting better with every update. (mini spoiler) Killed a shark and dragged it onto the beach JUST to look at how realistic it looked. Was like yup definitely a black tip. For now there isn't much content (however will be more in the near future obviously). Few flaws in the game (example, items not funtioning properly or at all) but I won't throw the game nor devs under the bus for that. Need to remember it's Early Access. Great game to muck around, build to your heart's content. Definitely recommend this game (doesnt cost too much) and you get a lot of hours into it. create your own island how you want to, put it into your game so you can play around on it. Even create a new world with a random new seed and start again in a completely different set up. Go on and buy it :3\n\nps. when needing help the forums are replied to in just a few hours or less.
