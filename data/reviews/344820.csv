I liked the idea of the open world and modular basebuilding, which this release is completely lacking.  You don't build a base in this at all.  You build furniture, or production stations.  And the world is divided into small areas with travel times/loading between them.  The original game I backed was abandoned.  The buggy final version of the original idea is still better than this release.  That being said, what they have released is an ok game, just not what they promised and not that interesting.  It is probably worth the $10 they are charging, just don't expect what was promised by the crowdfunding campaign.","October 4, 2015","false","1.5"," 53 of 73 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","53","73","2","0"

Ultimately it's a blend of Dead State crossed with This War of Mine on a tighter budget. 3 game modes are provided, Survival, Challenge and Endless. Survival focuses on a 20 day period, Challenge modes goal is fighting out of the city and Endless limits item respawns and such.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gSCnyM_FRg\nFresh rounds require selection 2 team members, all characters have alternate stats and others can be recruited while traveling to new locations. Employing a map/hub system the game shows all the possible ranges of enemies along with loot that may be discovered. Perhaps in some ways a downside as it leaves little up to chance. Complete missions and return to a central base, where you spend time hoarding loot, upgrading  and receiving some well deserved R&R. Characters can be sent out solo or in teams so while it's possible to scout multiple locations at once, with more rewards comes greater risk.\n\nDecent game of the price and one that surprised me. At the very least it's worth keeping your eye on. More so fans of survival sims/rpgs like those I've mentioned above.

I wouldn't go as far as to say it's a "scam" like some others but it's clear these developers don't have the talent needed as a team to reasonably execute what they set out to and claim.  What it boils down to right now is a group of college students that have some talent for sure but really no experience to make this something worth getting unless they spend another year on it, and even then it won't be anything like advertised.\n\nI would rate this lower than Dead State but with arguably better graphics based on preference.  I also backed Dead State in Early Access.  I guess for now the only people willing to attempt a game of this genre and scope (open worldish, zombie survival base builder rpg... that's not a shooter) don't have the combined team talent or resources to successfully execute it.  They should probably aim for better game play, stylized (and simplier) graphics so they can focus on the things that really matter.\n\nThere's a lot of areas to point out as undeveloped and missing if really needed to justify the down rating but even at this phase of the game there appears to have no real character screen where you can see any character Stats or Skills, whatever and this is a game advertised as characters with Stats, Skils, even Relationship Development.  The closest thing is the Inventory menu.","October 4, 2015","false","1.7"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","27","36","0","0"

Society as we know it has vanished! The year is 2150, you are the leader of a group which is determined to survive. Your focus is exploring, scavenging, fighting and building the best shelter for survival!\n\nForsaken Fortress Strategy is a survival / team management / strategy game which takes place in a post-apocalyptic area. At the start of each game, you will have to choose 2 out of 6 available characters, each of them has a specific skill set (crafting, close combat etc.). The girls will start with weapons but are restricted to how much they can carry compared to the blokes. Your camp is basically a house and you will have access to a stash of necessary items, a construction workshop and a bed to be built.  When you are ready, you will have to explore the world so you can scavenge important items the like planks of wood, metals, medicine, food and more in order to build useful structures. You can build a kitchen for cooking one of your favourite meals (roast with chemical gravy, what a treat), beds, workbench, medical station and more to make sure you survive as long as you can.\n\nEarly in the piece, you will be able to recruit the other 4 characters, which will be very handy so you can carry a lot more of the items that you find out there. You will come across bandits: some have great firing power (AK47) and you will probably relive the famous scene from an Iconic movie, where Indiana is face to face with an enemy waving his sword impressively to scare him. What does Indiana do, get out his gun and shoots him! Well, you will not be Indiana in this case. So, make sure you get guns as early as you can! You will also encounter zombies; some are your height and some will be twice as tall and will be quite a handful to kill.\n\nMake sure you look at the state of each your characters as low morale and energy could sink them. Feed them well so they can still walk about.\n\nThe combat system is easy to get used too and I really like the fact that you can pause and direct your characters to attack a specific enemy. The audio is well done in my opinion; it really project the atmosphere of being in a sorrowful, empty, scary place with no way out.\n\nIn terms of graphics, they are sound. The camera view is not as smooth as I would expect; I think it needs to improve in that regards.\n\n3 modes available on this early access: Survival (survive 20 days), Challenge (clear the city gate to win) and Free mode (Survive as land as you can).\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good graphics & audio\n-	Easy combat and crafting systems\n-	Interesting enemies (zombies wise)\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Camera mode need improvements\n-	No achievements or trading cards\n\nIf you like survival / team management / strategy blended together, as I do, this game will be a great addition to your game library.\n\n7.5 / 10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Not because I know the developers or anything, instead, because this is a game I've had in the back of my mind for a long, long time. Basically you build, craft grow or trade to keep a group of 2-6 survivors alive in a post apocalyptic world. A world where zombies, mutants, bandits, psychopaths and xenophobes really dont give a hoot about your existence. In fact, they are often downright rude. I understand that resources in the new world order are limited, but is it necessary to try and kill me and add me to said scant resources? Unscrupulous!\n\nAnyway joking aside\npros\n\n+full rotating/zooming cameras...... you know the deal\n+crafing, building, trading, starvation, illness, freezing, sleep deprivation, yep, there all here for you to suffer through          and overcome\n+creepy sound and music\n+ wounds and other negative effects like being exhausted are animated on screen instead of just a minus 3 to hit or whatever on your character sheet.\n+ pretty solid gameplay.\n\n+ animations often match action. There is different animation when your character s making vegetable soup and when they are roasting meatm and different sounds too. This is a nice touch.\n\nNote: one of the people who gave this game a negative review posted that the scavenged areas do not reaspawn and he is just dead wrong. Seems to be kinda random but after a week or so loot does respawn and even kinda "grows" meaning if you let it alone longer you will gain more loot\nCons\n- balancing, but hey its still early access.\n- no description of what your skills actually do. but it appears they decrease time for an action to be completed. I know thats the case for scavenging anyway.\n\ndefinetly early access\nSome glitches every now and then.\nOnce again this game scrathes an itch in my ganing desires.......I beleive I will scratch that itch now/","November 24, 2015","true","38.7"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","20","29","2","1"

Maybe this one is it.\n\nThe gameplay is very good, but it provided me up to seven hours of satisfaction to hit end game. Though, I may have just masterfully beat the game so I am unsure. It requires alot of wits, timing, stealth and angling to get yourself through certain situations.\n\nAlot of the early game requires you to be a runner and get the hell out of the LOS of those who are clearly stronger than you.\n\nLate game feels lacking but thats probably due to early access status.\n\nAll in all if they add huge amount of customizablity, and a more personal touch so that you feel more engaged with your survivors this game can be up there with the triple A titles. Also if they somehow give attention to a modding community, I think this game will be up there with the elder scrolls series and fallout series with moddability. I think this game needs the community's touch which mods will add tremendously. If they do this I honestly think this game will provide the minimum of 200 hrs of gameplay.

I'm a huge fan of survival squad based rpg games so this game is right in my wheelhouse, if it were turn based it could potentially be the best thing ever. So far there's a lot of places you can visit and various bits of armour and equipment that you can make.  Though the screenshots don't look like the game, which is odd, the interface is different as are the characters. There's only a few characters to choose from and each one has a special ability, but it's quite easy to recruit characters which makes the characters not feel as important.\n\nI didn't notice much in the way of bugs other than characters not running when others would and sometimes when trying to move the camera around it wouldn't let you do it.\n\nThe emphasis in the early part of the game is melee combat, which is fine, but most of your human opponents have guns.  If you can get the jump on them by hiding around a corner or behind a door when they come charging at you it's easy to use three guys with melee weapons to gang up on them and wipe them out. Two maps are particularly good for this while other ones are harder because there's less cover and it's easier for the enemy to snipe you. The real danger comes from facing multiple melee based enemies.  Day 7 kept wiping me out with a horde of zombies with spiked bats even using the door as a chokepoint they still manage to get 4 in the doorway and wipe out my three guys. Long range weapons may fix that, but I hadn't made them yet while trying to do everything else to keep my team alive. Zombies with weapons is just mean man.\n\nAn easy setting would help along with multiple save spots and an autosave at each dawn. I can make a long laundry list of features that could be added, feel free to contact me developers :)\n\nThough I kept dying, I do like a game that has a challenge to it. It's almost alarming how similar it is to This War of Mine, like it's an isometric version but with zombies and a more developed combat system. It works though. Hopefully updates will address balancing a little and it could be an engaging time suck of a game.","September 21, 2015","true","36.5"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/344820/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntroductionMixing games - and genres - like This War Of Mine and Dead State generally seems like a good idea. This isn’t always the case, though, as we sadly all know (and have usually experienced ourselves). So, is this altered remake of the originally-crowdfunded game worthy of your time right now or does it need to be in Early Access a while longer? Let’s quickly find out.\n\nGameplayYou start off by selecting two survivors from a group of six. All of these survivors have their own skills; one of them may be good in building while another one might be better with firearms, et cetera. Once you have chosen two people you will be dropped off in a house and your goal will be to survive for 20 days (by then it’s already 19).\n\nIf you ever played This War Of Mine then you will likely already understand how it all works.\nFor those who haven’t (yet) played that game; the game expects you to expand your hideout by building and upgrading useful furniture. This is done by looting places close by. All the while trying to survive, take care of your survivors and actively defend yourself from humans and zombies alike.\n\nYour survivors have several meters that you have to keep an eye on: sadness, energy, hunger, wellness and injury. You can increase the meters (or, at least, try to let them decrease at a slower rate) by building campfires and kitchens while also making sure they don’t get hurt too much/get sick and by just letting them sleep every now and then.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531283415\nBesides carefully watching over your group you can also let them craft weapons (which you should absolutely do if you want to make any progress) and other tools that will help you to (easier) survive those 20 days.\nNaturally weapons and gear can be equipped to make your characters more powerful but they won’t suddenly turn into superheroes. These are still (virtual) human beings, and even though they can be shot multiple times before they die they are not invincible: once a survivor is dead you will have lost him or her forever (unless you apply a first aid kit in time) and you can then try to recruit a new one. But it will never be the same as they all have unique skills, which I already wrote about a moment ago. Still, it’s better than nothing. At least with another survivor you have a better chance at surviving.\n\nSo once you’ve been dropped into your house you can choose where to go to with one or both of your survivors. By opening the map you can choose which way you want to go. It’s recommended to start in the Easy or Normal areas because otherwise you’ll most likely be killed within seconds. Each area is different; there might be an alley with a house where you can loot of items from (but you still have to be beware of enemies!). In other areas you might be able to find survivors that you can recruit while in others you will most likely get shot by untrusting survivors if you’re not too careful. These are the places you can normally get a lot of loot from, however. The risk/reward mechanic works very well in a game like this, especially considering the setting and tone.\n\nThere are a lot of places to loot/scavenge but depending on how many survivors you bring with you you might not have enough space in your inventory to grab just about everything. This results in having to make some tough choices along the way; do you bring a first aid kit with you in case someone gets hurt during the next mission (maybe even the same one?) or will you just grab a few pieces of wood instead so that you’re at least able to build or upgrade that next piece of furniture (that might prove to be even more useful (in the long run)). Life really is hard.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531283452\nWhile Forsaken Fortress Strategy isn’t a roguelike you do have to be careful that not all of your survivors get wiped out. Otherwise it really is game over. Thankfully you can save in-between missions, in your hideout. But only here! You can’t save during actual missions. So if you have a feeling that things are going well make sure and save once in a while. It might just save your life (no, not literally, of course). It will save a lot of stress and frustration in the end.\n\nYour survivors can also use stealth and it’s recommended to use it as much as possible in order to prevent unplanned battles. You can’t avoid everything, but sometimes it’s clear when you might just lose a battle.\n\nThere are multiple gameplay modes, too. You have Survive, which I have discussed in a little more detail just now, Challenge, where you goal is to get out of the city and Endless, which speaks for itself.\n\nOne other thing I’d like to mention, though, aside from the actual gameplay is that the controls do take some getting used to, but so far this - for me at least - only applies to the keyboard controls.\n\nAudio & VisualsThe music is moody and it definitely fits the game’s atmosphere, although it’s a little more up-tempo during battles. There doesn’t seem to be any voice acting and the sounds effects are rather basic, but they get the job done I guess.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531283489\nThe visuals are okay and could definitely use a little more detail, especially as far as the animations are concerned. Keep in mind, however, that this still is an Early Access game. While it clearly lacks polish at this very moment, it’s possible that the gameplay is the main focus of attention right now. So it’s likely we’ll see graphical improvements and more polish during the upcoming months.\n\nLength/Replay ValueI can be really short about the length. Since it’s still in Early Access some content is currently still missing: bigger maps and more enemies, for example. Therefore it’s hard to exactly calculate but you can easily get 10-15 hours or more out of it right now. I think, with some luck, that the story can be completed even faster than that, but I don’t see any reason to rush through it. For €10 this is a pretty good deal!\n\nConclusionForsaken Fortress Strategy won’t set the world on fire, but with just a little more polish it is and will be absolutely worth your time and money. If you enjoyed games like Dead State and/or This War Of Mine then there’s nothing to dislike here. The gameplay is solid and while the rest of the game is still in a relatively early state I expect the final product to look and play much better than what is currently being offered.\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Different gameplay mechanics\n+ Six survivors with their own unique skills\n+ Multiple gameplay modes available\n\nMixed:\n+/- Graphically it doesn’t look terrible, but there are still some bugs and glitches that need to be fixed\n\nCons:\n- Might be a little intimidating if you’re new to the genre\n- Lacks polish\n- Keyboard controls can be a little awkward\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer/publisher.\nRating: 7.0 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)\n\n\nWant to read more of my unbiased reviews?

Comparing the game to 'This War of Mine' is fair.\n\nKickstarter said it would be open world its not. You have to build your base select areas to explore and scavenge. Bandits zombies and other creepy looking monsters will defend areas, you'll need to explore the easier areas first and build up weapons and let other survivors join your team. Managing food can be hard at the start but keep your team small at first and you'll be fine. Sticking to easy areas gets you started pretty quickly.\n\nI'm going to wait until the games been updated a bit before playing it again. I would advise keeping an eye on this one.\n\nI was really looking forward to an open world adventure where you could equip a group of survives send them out in a truck to kill bandits for loot then return to base to defend it from a wave of zombies. manning towers and gun turrets.

It had a Open world situation...no "spend # hrs to travel to ****", sure time could be used traveling in open world...but it isn't always the same...that and it had vehicles. Another is that the creativity in base building...has now been downplayed and has been brought down to smply base customizing. Will admit it is still decent, but I would of loved to build the base rather than have a pre-set building the entire game.\nAnother point so far is survivors...I simply go up to one...ask...and they join...seems silly when you would likely consider they want something done first or want something in return...not a simple "wanna join? > sure!" situation.\nAnother point I was wanting to add is that the character sheets are...really confusing.\nExample: I chose 2 survivors, one who had a skill in scavenging and the other at crafting. But somehow my crafter had MUCH better scavenging stats while the scavenger had crappy scavenging stats...and sure the crafter had great crafting skills...but my scaveger also had great engineering and good crafting. I am wandering if the "skills" add certain things rather than actually effect the stats.\nOther than that...if they are still working the the offical game, then great ^_^....if this is now the offical game...then...kinda unfair :(","October 10, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Great concept but given that I can't get simple functions to work properly on my system (camera panning, in-game windows won't close to go back to the main screen, etc.) I haven't been able to even start playing it. Not worth the $10, not worth 10ct until they make it playable outta the box.","November 2, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"
