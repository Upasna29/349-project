I couldn't take any more grinding to get past the probably final dungeon, after the random encounter enemies were wiping me out despite being at level 50+ and having the best armor.\n\nIt's stock art, enemies and sound. RPGmaker stock stuff isn't bad but it shows a relative lack of effort. Major enemies and allies share sprites as well - I thought Samson had betrayed me or something but it was actually just some guy who was identical. The plot is relatively standard stuff: You, the sole capable fighter in the kingdom, must fight the entire army of darkness alone. Naked and armed with a long knife.\n\nThe main method of unlocking new towns and dungeons is mana collection. You collect mana by playing tag with angels inside of trees and caves. I'm not exaggerating, that's exactly what you do. You need to catch about 10 angels per dungeon (more or less, as the mana gain is randomized) while dodging enemies and going back to respawn the angels at a prayer point. It's pretty tedious.\n\nThere's a lot of grinding, but levels are useless aside from skill and HP/MP gain. Equipment is nearly the sole factor in victory or defeat. You also get only a pittance of money for each win. 'Sidequests' involve collecting a rare drop from enemies and turning it in repeatedly for a slightly better XP and cash gain.\n\nThe party system has some issues. The main character and his healer friend are permanent, leaving you with two spaces. The first three allies you unlock have the same class, equips and skills with only slightly different stat growths. The next three, halfway into the game, are a clone of the main character, a clone of the healer and a slightly different clone of the main character. There's also party switching. It's broken! If you do it wrong you can permanently lose a character, and even if you do it right your old and new characters lose all levels and gear! Why is this? Many games have figured out dynamic parties, it's not a new thing.\n\nItem crafting is lame. First you have to grind enemies or certain respawning material points (similar to angels, but the ore doesn't run from you). It takes a good deal per item, and you need something like 2700 for a full set. Additionally, you're capped at 99 like every other item so you need to go back from time to time and drop them off. God forbid you pick up a chest full of the stuff without having  the space. The worst part of that is that after you collect the raw materials, you need to go 'refine' them. It takes five confirm presses to refine one item. There is no option for mass refinery. So if you want that end-game gear you'd better be ready to stand around and mash Z for a solid hour.\n\nThis may be a bug, but on-field enemies don't despawn. You can get caught in normal random battles, and flee or win as normal. But visible enemies pursue you and force you into a no-escape fight if they catch up. Even if you win, they don't go away - just take a step back (if they aren't blocked) and stop chasing you a while. God help you if you get caught in a hallway or have two enemies blocking you in a corner.\n\nPretty much the only thing this game has going for it is an active and interested creator. Overall I have no idea why you would pay $20 for this game! It might be good to kill ten hours if you got it for free. There are better RPGmaker games available.","August 23, 2015","false","14.4"," 44 of 65 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","44","65","3","5"

I tried to like it but it gave me no chance.My eagerness for exploration was utterly smashed by my frustration with those endless boooring battles out of the blue. I could continue to state why I dislike this game, anyway if you want a decent 2D RPG I recommend visiting Aveyond Kindom, I played a lot of their games and not once was I this disappointed.","January 14, 2015","false","0.7"," 20 of 87 people (23%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","23","20","87","9","10"

The recent steam review overhaul seems to have removed the erroneous flags however.\n\nI get it, it's tough to take criticism about something you created, but this type of behavior is not doing you any favors. Just let the negative reviews be.","June 6","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
