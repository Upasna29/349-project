That’s a confusing thing that doesn’t make any sense to me, but that’s OK, that’s fine, it’s not something to get all catty about. And I don’t want to just make jokes about furries here, because that’s cheap and doesn’t say anything about the game or the problems it has that are fundamentally there regardless the whole business of day-glo ferrets hobbling about the place. For example, these guys decided to make their visual novel in RPG Maker, which means that it uses a lot of CPU and also the options menu offers such useful features as auto-run and the ability to remember which action you last used in combat which are all very useful in this tedious choose your own adventure bull-♥♥♥♥. The first thing that happens is some dog thing with implausible colors spouts off a silly tail about mysticism or alternate worlds or something, then you wake up on a train with the largest seats in the world. I thought that since you’re there with a squirrel maybe the player character is just really tiny, but it turns out that the Japanese just love to scurry about underneath their stupidly massive seats while riding the bullet train. Then you meet ROOK T OVERFERRET, who you can also befriend on Steam because he is a terrible self-insert among a whole cast of self-inserts. Self-insert writing is bad regardless of whether or not you make yourself a big animal person who is so sexy that he used to be Japan’s premiere male host in their most famous maid café and the developer gets to be the world’s most famous pop star of course and is a silly dog with rainbow hair and i can't ♥♥♥♥ing take it anymore I don’t like this game it’s got a bunch of choices that don’t really matter it’s got awful writing the characters are horrible and annoying and they are all designed like they fell into a paint factory and the game is a scam, it’s literally a scam, how the ♥♥♥♥ is it definitive if it’s early access why is the original still for sale, take it down or something or just rename it what was the point of this why is it even here and why did you make your game in rpg maker just use renpy or twine it’s not hard come ON dude shape it UP also I ran out of animal puns I’m sorry\n\n\n\n\nJust call me OVERHUMAN\n","May 19","false","0.5"," 93 of 114 people (82%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","82","93","114","32","12"

So far the changes made seem to make the story even more of an all over the place mess and some of the backgrounds being used now are very unfitting and silly (First scene on the subway for example, giant chairs?).\n\nThis game does have a rather nice soundtrack, character art and it is not unenjoyable if you don't try to take it to seriously, if you are deadset on playing the game I would advise doing it with a group of friends, each reading a character as I have done this in the past and it made the game a whole lot more fun. And I have to give credit to the developer for making this version of the game free to those who own the base game.\n\nTo sum up, it's not really a good game, but it's not godawful either in my opinion.\n\nIf you are walking into this game wanting an idea of what the furry fandom is or to learn about furry culture this game gives absolutely no experience of those topics, it is simply a story that takes place using fursonas belonging to members of the furry fandom.\n\nI don't want to start any drama, buy the game, don't buy the game, it's up to you, but to me it is still a rather bad game on it's own, and I wouldn't recommend buying it at this point in time, but who knows? It's still in early access after all, and the developer really does seem to be listening to fans.

The developer has stated on the discussion board he has a explanation for this and will have it posted in the near future.\n\n\nSpecial Note Edit: I had stated in the previous version of this review that crashes were a concern. On inspection it was a faulty download on either Steam's part or a faulty install to the drive on my end. I let the game run and retested the parts the game crashed at and have not had an issue since.\n\n\nI will take the opportunity to use my introduction paragraph as a disclaimer for what I hope the reader to expect in the coming review. I am no way affiliated with the anthropomorphic community nor do I understand the terminology used by them on a daily-basis. I am not knowledgeable in the least about what a fursona is or the stereotypes used by them, but I do understand the usage of a stereotype and the tropes established by them. This review will not focus on the insertion of the real people apparently using these characters in everyday life or of the scandal I researched that took place with the original release which I have not played. All I plan to do with this review is determine from the bugs, cliches and story structure if it is a recommended product to pick up at the current interval at the current asking price. That said, I will begin with the most important issue: artwork.\n\nVisual novels are usually known for their wide variety of artwork and character models, but in this case the art was left at the curve. Backgrounds are slightly faded pictures of random locations while character models are stuck with one pose (two if you count switching the facing direction). The only person who had more than one pose was named Eclair, a cafe maid feline you meet along one of the branching paths. This would have made it very difficult to follow dialog, but thankfully a character portrait is placed next to the text box to designate who was speaking. The actual artwork was decent, but I will say some of the designs left me trying to figure out the gender of a certain character. This is not a fault or a pro, it is just a little observation. The music was rather pleasant, so I do commend the audio wizards for that.\n\nOne factor I will consider a fault is the off the wall pacing and stereotypical characters. The story was not hard to understand, thanks to very minimal spelling errors and grammar issues, but the structure was throwing out random monologues in one direction and character backstory in another. You have the main conflict discussed, but some elements are introduced and fall of the face of the earth to never be discussed again. It would not be an issue if the characters were not so stereotypically written. Each character has a forced cliche approach, which feels stale and plain boring to read when the dialog comes from such sterile personalities. I felt the urge to skip most of the character monologues on several occasions just for this reason alone.\n\nThe branching paths determined by dialog selections does have an impact in certain situations. Two of the choices very early in the game will allow you to meet a certain character while others will open additional character arcs for the reader to experience. Thankfully, the game provides very ample opportunities to save, even if the amount of available save slots is restricted to 20 right now. Actual outcomes are up for interpretation. I played through the game three times to try and get an idea of how different the outcomes can be, only to discover the story follows the same general direction. The people who die are still the same and the events that you are involved with are still the same. Maybe it will change once the rest of the story is released, but for now it is really is just a cosmetic feature.\n\nAs I mentioned in the opening paragraph, this is not a judge of the actual story of the elements surrounding the content (except for the stereotyping). Most of the problems stem from a disjointed flow. It took me about 2 hours to get through the first playthrough and four hours total play time with all three playthroughs. For the price, I would say it is a little light. This will hopefully change down the line, but at this point I cannot recommend the product. As per my policy, I will return to this visual novel sometime in the future to reevaluate it and hopefully change my initial opinion.\n\nPros\n\n- Spelling and grammar is up to par\n- Soundtrack was decent\n\nCons\n\n- Stereotypical characters\n- Very erratic and out of tone pacing\n- 2 hours to get through a play through","May 20","false","6.4"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","27","35","0","4"

I can safely say that this game has changed for the better. and has made my entire last review almost irrelevant.\n\nFor a quick overview.\n"Is the game good?"\nWell, that is subjective.\nLet me answer that with more questions.\n\nDo you Enjoy Furries, or at least their Anthro counterparts?\nDo you Enjoy a Visual Novel experience?\nDo you Enjoy a Visual Novel where your choices define who you are and what path you choose?\nDo you Enjoy Murder Stories?\nDo you Enjoy Japanese Sub culture?\nDo you Enjoy Fantasy Worlds?\nIf you answered yes to most of those than you have a high Likelyhood of enjoying this game.\n\nMy initial impression of it was.. bad to say the least (1rst CH.) but it has come a long way.\nMy new scores are as follow. (As of CH.5 release)\n\nMusic 8/10\nThe Music has gotten a Re-vamp, No longer do I hear ANY stock music, it seems to be all costom made for the VN.\nand it can be quiet addictive to hum or sing after a playthrough.\nI can Only hope they release the V-CD so I can download these to my phone.\nThough your milage may vary as I have a taste for said genre of music.\n\nGameplay 8/10\nI decided to bring this down to an Eight instead of a nine after reconsideration. Even though I believe the gameplay (for a visual novel) is superb! BUT I also think it could have some improvements, such as more sprites or weakly animated motions to make it seem they are more lively, or just more Facial animations. But I assume that sort of thing could be added as free DLC after the main game is finished. (Given the Creator free time to do so.)\nAnd even if not, the game still is worthy of the Score.\n\nStory 9/10\nEven though I am not partial to these sort of stories, it really drew me in. Be it the side stories, or the main story itself. Human curiosity makes me always want more. There's not much else I can say without spoilers.\n\nCharacter 8/10\nThe characters this time around are less stereotypical and more, Shall I say, Life like?\nThey are far more fleshed out and even make me care about people that might not even matter in the overall arch of the story.. and I say Might as.. I cannot tell who is background and who is not. which is a achievment any VN developer should strive for.\n\nCharacter designs 8/10\nNow, I have my personal feelings on some of these. As there are less than a handfull that stick out like sore thumbs.\nAs they just look too Animated to fit in with the rest of the cast. And have a real (OC) feel to them.\nWhich I personally see as a con. That is why I marked it down two points. Other than that Most characters fit in the world they are in and can at times make me forget they are not human.\n\nWriting 9/10\nThe writing feels very professional since I last saw its dilapidated form..\nAnd now is on par with most reading material you would see in a Succesful book.\nI have yet to find a typo or a missused word.\nAnd the Vocab, the author uses, is Above Average. (I even had to look up some of the words, which I honestly see as a plus)\n\nChoices 8.5/10\nMost choices Feel as if they matter immediatly or a little bit down the road.\nAnd some of the choices even let you describe yourself, which will then effect how your character acts in game.\nWhich is near perfection.\nThough my biggest complaint would be that there is usually no middle ground, And only two extreme options in most cases. But that is more of a personal gripe, as I found myself wanting neither choice and would rather seek a middleground with the two.\n\nI really have little to say about this game that is negative after all the updates. But I encourage you to watch this video of me explaining my last review in detail. As well as give finer points to this review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxNUfnOZoUM\n\nAlso I would like to apologize for not updating this review earlier.. this game did not deserve me leaving the bad review I did after so much was done, and how much the game has improved.","May 22","true","10.7"," 11 of 28 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","11","28","2","1"

From the loveable characters to the suspenseful plot there is definitely something to be had here. I played this game back when it was a free beta and remember my excitement when i first heard the menu music playing. For me music like that is a promise. A promise for something great and fantastic and an adventure that will keep me enticed from start to finish.\n\n[Now i know what you're saying, "But why does it say it's a complete edition if it is early access??? That doesn't make any sense!!!"\n\nWell that is because the developer of the game, Klace, is not entirely finished yet. It is stated in the description if you want anymore info. If you are reading this part of the review and the game is already complete then please disregard.]\n.\n.\n.\nCharacters: Every single character in the game has depth and feeling. When I interacted with them I identified them with a lot of real world people I know. The character Kila for example reminds me of a really close friend that I used to have. That sense of familiarity really does influence how you will go about playing the game since every one in it feels pretty genuine.\n.\n.\n.\nGameplay: In traditonal visual novel fashion you have the ability to make choices that influence how the game will end. This is very reminicent of the Visual Novel Morenatsu, another furry novel. It's very interesting to have a game that actually takes your choices into account rather than just carrying the illusion of choice like most triple A games today. Some characters respect or hate you for the game duration based on what you say or do. Really gives the player a sense of immersion.\n.\n.\n.\nSoundtrack: Music is a huge selling point for me as stated above. Boy does the game deliver on that aspect. I was really captured by the entire score while I was playing because it set the right mood. Nothing about it was under used or overdone. My hats off to the composer who treated this game and the atmosphere it portrayed with care.\n.\n.\n.\nFinal thoughts: Overall this is a very repectable game and a wonderful entry into the gaming scene for Klace. It manages to capture a world of his own design perfectly and rarely misses a beat. While it may not be my absolute favorite game of all time it still deserves a purchase and some recognition for what it conveys here. As a furry or someone trying to get into the community you owe it to yourself to play this game.\n.\n.\n.\n10/10 already playing again. <3","May 21","true","16.7"," 7 of 23 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","7","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raxyz/recommended/475490/","raxyz","Raxyz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raxyz/","440 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAbout the Early Access...\nMajor/Minor is a episodic title, much like Telltale does. However, an indie dev wouldn't get as much attention as Telltale does, so the "Definitive Edtion" is basically the full game version. If you're following this game but want to get it when it's completed, do so when this version is out of EA. Now onto the actual review.\n\nSome games just can't be simplified by "Thumbs Up" or "Thumbs Down", this is one such case. So I save "Not Reccomended" cases to games that are busted, broken, bad DLC practices, harmful policies toward customers and similar cases. Major/Minor doesn't fall into any of those categories.\n\nSo, you're reading this to know whether you should buy it or not, let's start addressing the elephant in the room (pun kinda intended):\n-Eeewww, furry\nThis issue tend to plague a LOT of things. I've had my share of heated discussions about Dust AET or Zootopia, those are two examples of awesome games/movies that people dismiss for thinking that "it is furry". News flash, when aiming for a rated E genre, something meant for all ages, a fantasy world is required. How to better to unbind ourselves of reality than not having human-like characters? Walt Disney knew that, look at his characters. Most kids show tend to use this, it's not something new, nor it's something "furry"\nBut Major/Minor might not look like it's neutral nor like it's a kid's game, does it? Indeed, the game page adverstises that “This game stands alone as a great introduction to those who want to get a first-hand immersive experience in furry culture and furry fandom.” And that's not something it would appeal to anyone who isn't a furry. However it also says that Major/Minor is "A visual novel inspired by greats such as Steins;Gate, Tales of Symphonia and Persona 4.". If you're anything like me, you'll think this is a tall order to beat, but it'll definitely pique your curiosity.\n\nSo yes, the game is indeed "furry", if you're part of that fandom the game will easily appeal to you, but what if you're not? Then there's two cases, either you'll be the purebreed hater (which by no means will read any review marked as "Reccomended", making this part pretty pointless) or the regular guy who doesn't care about "furry fandom" and neither having anthro characters. Believe it or not, this is where I am. I mentioned Zootopia and Dust because those are two things I love, and it angers me people dismissing it due to having anthropomorphic characters, no one cares about the beautiful story, artworks, characters or moral lessons in those, only how they look. That's just sad.\n\nBut I'm deviasting from the topic at hand. For those who do not consider themselves furries, and would have no interest in a visual novel just because of a specific fandom, how does Major/Minor fares? It definitely doesn't come close to the overall quality P4, Steins Gate or Tales of Symphonia has, but there are clear references of it in the game. Think of it like this, if you've played any of those, odds are your brain thought of some "branches" that weren't explored in the games. This game's developer gathered those ideas and made his own game. But how does it compare to those other games? There's some clear references, right in the beggining of the game, you'll be greeted into the Velvet Room Ark and not much longer after that you'll know about the MidnightChannel Murders. At that point I wondered if I was about to play a furry re-telling of Persona, but not long after that the game took a drastic turn, taking you to another world entirely. After 3 hours into the Novel, I can say that the story references those games while being it's own thing.\n\nThe problem of a Visual Novel, is that you don't really know whether it's good or not until you've read the whole history, and I'm not there yet. But here's what I CAN say about it:\nTL;DR+ Does a good job using aspects of other stories while still being original\n+ Story branches are very well done, not every VN can make such radical changes at how the branches play out.\n+ OST is catchy. Some VN's are plagued by annoying songs, however that does vary from people to people.\n+ Good diversity of characters. (Personally, it reminded me of Borderlands 2)\n- Character artwork is a bit awkward at first glance\n- No characters animations/emotions, meaning sometimes they break some sad news to you while smirking. It breaks the immersion a little.\n- No custom saves or interims. Meaning the game decides when to save for you.\n- Quick text skip is still too slow if you're re-doing large sections\n\nSo the bottom line is: I suppose this game is great if you're interested in the furry fandom, disposable if you outright hate it. And if you're somewhere in between, liking VNs while not caring about being furry or not, try the demo first (Demo is no longer around. I wrote this review after playing 3~4 hours in it. Now it's gone). I intend to update this review after completing the game, to say whether the story is worth it or not.\n\nEDIT: So far the game only has 5 chapters, and that's not very far into the story I'd bet. Color me impressed though, it REALLY grabbed my interest. I love stories that drop a ♥♥♥♥♥torm after another, reminds me of the book series Escape from Furnace, not a single dull moment. Though be wary of cliffhangers, the story isn't finished yet. So far I'm liking the story.","May 21","true","0.1"," 7 of 23 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","7","23","0","0"

My review is valid up to Chapter 4 release, beyond that may come off as out dated. Here is my original review from the base game with hours showing I have played it, while also copy pasting the text here for convinence.\n\nI do plan to write a whole new review ONCE the story is finished, but instead for the base game I'll make a new one for this version.\n\nGeneral Disclaimer\nThis is a Visual Novel. There is no gameplay other than click to read and make choices that will present to you. If you're expecting this to be an RPG of some kind, you're sadly mistaken.\n\nIf you find heavy text boring and complain like, “It's just enter, read text, enter, read text, enter, read text...” you’re better off avoiding all Visual Novels and sparing your sanity along with sparing people from hearing you whine about what the game actually is suppose to be.\n\nIf you’re disgusted at the sight of anthro characters, well if you buy this game and complain, you’ll most likely be seen as a whiner for wasting your own money and time on a product you knew yourself wouldn’t like.\n\nReview\nI’ve been following this VN since the month it was released. At the time of this review, there are 4 chapters out. Upon one chapter after another I was getting more and more glued into it. I even made a guide regarding the choices you may see and what effects they’ll have later on down the round in your playthrough. (Warning: My guide may have minor spoilers.)\n\nThere are two stories being told: One on Earth, another on Terra. They have no direct connection with one another and I find this format very unique to me and interesting. There are at least 2 plots going on with a possible third, or so I like to believe.\n\nEvery character stands out differently from one another. The music fits in with the mood nicely and well timed with the text. Choices prompted up may trigger another one later or cause an alternate route to some degree (note my guide). You may find yourself thinking hard of what to pick whether it’s moral or philosophical to you on some choices.\n\nThere are a few things to note:\nThere are no expressions (however en route at this time). It is normal or common for VN’s to have character expressions to help the reader feel more immerse to the story and the world, but this didn’t have them initially. I wasn’t at all bothered by this, but a lot found it unease or immersion breaking.\nThere is no voice acting.\nThe VN is episodic; despite it might feel it’s Early Access. There is currently no steady schedule for chapters after people wanted expressions so badly. There will be delays in new chapters arriving for quite some time.\nThe VN is for the general audience with the occasional minor violence it portrays time to time. If you’re expecting fan service, go to Sakura series or Nekopara vol 1 and 2 (you’re welcome in advance).\nYou can’t save freely, only when prompted. However, you may see them before or after a serious choice is prompted or a serious moment happened. They are far in between, however.\nAt this time I would say wait for a sale unless you have the money to spare for the full price, or till all chapters are out.","May 19","true","0.1"," 12 of 34 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","12","34","0","5"

I was legitimately shouting at my screen during several portions, while tearing up at others. The struggle these characters go through is immense, and the story isn't even done yet. I just hope we get a happy ending with no Game of Thrones BS. The best character and fan favorite is Konrad the Assassin. #shipping","May 19","true","0.1"," 5 of 21 people (24%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","24","5","21","0","0"

Guessing it's luck, but overall my original review still kinda stands, except I guess I have a bit more to add.\n\nNow while most of the stuff is the same, (atleast from what I could tell) I thought that the game seemed to be running a lot smoother, although it may have been my computer. I'm not quite sure if new facial animations have been added, as there were times when it looked like it was trying to change the sprite, but I'm not entirely sure as it could be my computer (My computer really sucks basically). Another small problem I had was it felt like the first two chapters were a bit too short and the third one felt extremely long, and a majority of the 3rd chapter was text for the most part.\n\nHowever something good did come out of it, as I have never been on such a mental and emotional rollercoaster like this before. It left me questioning a lot of my choices sort of like a more choice heavy Undertale, and for the most part I enjoyed it, especially some of the writting as most of it left me questioning some of my choices a lot, and now I'm beginning to even question who's the good guy and who's the bad guy.\n\nOverall, I'd still recommend it, though I'm not really sure if it's at it final stage of development yet, but if you're not really sure about, you can always just refund it.","May 19","true","2.0"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","7","26","0","0"
