So why the negative review? Well for one, Steam doesn't give me the option to have a neutral review, and two I want to give potential buyers some reasons as to why they wouldn't want to buy in. Most of the negative reviews don't really do that, at least not in detail.\n\nI've been following this game for a long time, a lot of love has gone in to its development, and it really shows through the quirky spritework. The problem with the development is that it's just been so painfully slow that I can't recommend spending $15 on it at this point, because the desire to check back in after a few months when nearly nothing new has been added fades away after over two years; and that's how long I've had this game. It was first released for beta purchase around April 1, 2014.\n\nOver the course of two years, the story has essentially gained one new dungeon (of which there was only one before) along with a marginal amount of content that shows this game is going to be in development for many more years. The content that's there is good, sure, but it's not so stellar as to justify playing through the story more than once or twice.\n\nThe real mode that seems to add playtime to this game is its arcade mode, which is roguelike in nature, and requires a good understanding of enemy/boss patterns to do well in. Players play through two floors representing each area in the story mode, complete with enemies from said area, and have no chances to heal except at the end of each floor. Despite having numerous floors and all of the enemies from the story mode, it's pretty light on content in terms of roguelikes. There are unlockables and such, but they only give minor advantages, and as a result adding more floors to the mode seems kind of pointless in its current state. Even after over two years of going back to this game I struggle to reach the 7th floor of what must be over 14 at this point. There isn't much incentive to bother trying to reach those floors either.\n\nSo should you buy this game? Well that depends on how patient you are. After two years I'm pretty burned out and don't see myself playing this game for a long, long time. If you think you can wait for what could be 5 years to play a finished product and want to support the developers, then by all means get this game. If not, keep an eye on it and pick it up a few years down the road when it has a more justifiable amount of content to offer.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the support guys, since this review got so much attention I want to add a little more.\n\nIf you're worried about spending $15 on a game that won't be finished, don't be. This game is a safe buy in my opinion. Even though the development has been very slow, it has been extremely consistent and the team behind this game definitely has what it takes to finish the job. Secrets of Grindea has been in the works since 2011, and the quality of the content in it has only improved since. Their dev blog[www.secretsofgrindea.com] has a weekly recap that is posted nearly every week without missing a beat. So if you're interested, definitely keep an eye on this game, because it is one of the better early access titles out there, despite the slow development speed.","May 12","false","44.2"," 213 of 240 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","213","240","6","4"

There are people who care about you and don't wish to see you go down this path (not me per se, we've only just met. But I'm sure there are people who love you very much. Like your grandmother or that neighbor with the nice rack. Anyway, I'm going off topic here).\n\nSecrets of Grindea is a tongue-in-cheek RPG that draws heavily on the nostalgia of games like Secrets of Mana, Zelda: Link to the Past, and Illusion of Gaia. The sprite animations and colorful backgrounds mimic classic 16-bit games and go well with the fluidity of combat. NPCs are prevalent in towns and in the overworld to the point where the world does not feel empty and that their character is not some lone warrior living on a planet full of monsters (though that sounds like an awesome game idea. Dibs). Each area has its own unique feel that you will hopefully enjoy because the aforementioned grinding will have you staying in one area killing the same enemies for drops.\n\nThe combat is extremely straight forward where your basic attack is spamming one button or having a charged skill where you hold and release one button. Let me go on record to say that I do not think this is a bad thing. Sure, you won't be chaining attacks that culminate in your wooden sword hitting with the power of a tactical nuclear device, but you will be unlocking and upgrading skills that define the way you, the player, wish to play. The skills are limited (for now I hope) to a 1 handed skill set, 2 handed skill set, and a magic skill set. The player is able to mix and match these skills however he or she wants and has the option to refund some or all of the skill points that were spent by spending gold (this is done in the menu rather than with an NPC). There is a bow the player can get from a sidequest but so far doesn't have a dedicated set of skills to leveling up the damage.\n\nThe story is pretty straightforward for an RPG of the era it emulates: You are a guy or gal that wakes up, is handing a magical bag that can hold anything without weight restrictions and are sent out to become a renowned member of the "Collectors". It seems, from the start, that these "Collectors" are a bunch of people that go out and collect cool, rare things. It is all very prestigious. And dangerous. And sexy. Seriously, so far every NPC that isn't a Collector is jealous of you. Normally one would have to buy seven sports cars and have an attractive life mate to get that kind of recognition. This game hands that to you right off the bat (Disclaimer: The developers of this game will NOT buy you cars nor introduce you to hot people for a hook up).\n\nMy main concern with the game is that it seems too short and I say that knowing full well that not all the features in the game have been implemented; this is not the reason that I feel the game is too short. The in-game journal keeps a record of all the enemies in the game and what they drop when killed. Enemies you haven't killed yet appear in the journal as silhouettes. Upon counting (yes, I did a math) I found that there are only about thirty (30) enemies total in the game including boss enemies. This, in my opinion, is a low number which may make gamers shy away from the game. An increase in not just the number of potential enemies but different types of enemies will add more variety to the grinding while still keeping the player's interest high. I eagerly await the areas that have not yet been implemented to the game.\n\nNow, I'm not going to end this review by giving the game a number based off of 5 nor 10 nor 325745456415 (<--- not sure what this number is. It just punched my Numpad to come up with something ridiculous). I will end this review with just a few simple words:\n\nI enjoy this game.\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoy it too.","July 18, 2015","true","25.8"," 104 of 114 people (91%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","91","104","114","53","0"

This game is as advertised.  It's a game similar to Secret of Mana (SNES), Crystalis (NES), Zelda-esque, Final Fantasy Adventure (Original GB)  and many other old RP games.\n\nYou can customize your character physically by gender, colour of your clothes, hair style and colour, and name.  Additonally, you get a vanity part for your hat, face, weapon, and shield.\n\nThe gameplay is very nice, you can be a full warrior, full mage, whatever you want to be; a combination if you want.  Although, being a healer is not an option.\n\nThis is a beta game, it's not complete, from my estimation it's a little near half done, if that.\n\nYou can play cooperatively, over the internet, using your steam friends list or direct IP!  This is awesome!\n\nYou grind in the game, if that wasn't obvious.  (What old school console RPG didn't have you grind?  It's part of the fun!)\n\nThe transition between keyboard and controller playing is seamless, you just start using your keyboard and it swaps to keyboard mode, you use your controller, it swaps to controller mode.  I found this particularly great!\n\nThe host of the game's save file is progressed in the story, however - if you're not the host - you keep everything you gained.  You simply have to play through the story (by hosting or single player) to go through it.  The rewards though, you do not acquire again, you already have them!  :D\n\nThis is an awesome game!  As far as I'm aware only three people are working on it and they're from Sweden.  They have me as a fan.  The sprite animation is awesome, the artwork for the avatars is great and expresses much emotion, and the game looks very polished for a beta that is not even half done!\n\nI used to pay $50+ US dollars for games like these, and wait years for the next to come out.  I love the game very much, and I haven't even started exploring the Arcade Mode.\n\ntl;dr - Buy this game if you loved Secret of Mana or any similar games on the console or PC.  Especially if you want to play it co-op with friends over the internet!","December 25, 2015","true","29.2"," 79 of 80 people (99%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","99","79","80","3","2"

Quick swordplay with an oldschool-meets-polish aesthetic that's filled with charm. Combat is quick paced and - with over 20 skills and spells with multiple charge levels, along with 30 talents - more or less unique for every character made. Every attack, skill and spell feels as if it has weight behind it for a thoroughly satisfying brawl through hordes of monsters and challenging bosses.\n\nThe story is serious at times, tongue in cheek in others without outright resorting to cheese. There's plenty of side-quests, mini-games and collectables, but contrary to the name no grinding appears to be necessary. The shield is as relevant to the gameplay as the sword is, every attack can be blocked if you know the exact timing, reminding me of the days of 'Timed Hits' from Super Mario RPG and Final Fantasy 8.\n\nThe music is beautiful, the characters well written to make you love or hate them, I can't say enough good things about Story Mode. The only shame is it's incomplete, but between pet taming, treasure hunting, fishing, card collecting, playing with 4 player online co-op and duking it out in the arena, there's more than enough content to keep me busy between updates.\n\nArcade Mode: All the rules from Story Mode no longer apply, Arcade Mode feels like an entirely different game. Less Secret of Mana, more Binding of Isaac. You start in an empty plain and delve within a randomized roguelike-esque labyrinth. Each room is different every time, filled with traps and all manners of enemies or bosses not present in Story Mode. HP is precious, mastery of skills, spells and shielding is required.\n\nArcade Mode is perfect for sinking endless hours into as you try to go deeper and deeper into the labyrinth, gaining points and essence to level up and expand your town, unlock new NPCs to aid you, take on quests for rare and unique loot not found anywhere else. Skills and spells are best experimented with in here to see which build suits you best. With friends it's harder, but with 4 people on screen the monsters barely stand a chance once you hit your groove. The online leaderboards for Arcade Mode help to give it even more replay value by trying to do better than your friends or complete strangers to try and hit #1.\n\nIf you have any doubts whatsoever, try the demo. With an hour of Story Mode gameplay, several hours of Arcade Mode and co-op bundled into the demo, it's a great teaser for what to expect moving forward.\n\nTip: Opt into 'Frontline' by selecting SoG in your library if you want quicker updates. The normal version receives slower updates, but your experience in the game will be much smoother.","July 13, 2015","true","303.2"," 64 of 68 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","64","68","0","5"

Yours may differ to mine. I also only really played the story mode and did co-op.\nSecrets of Grindea is an action RPG with a major focus on the story and meticulous detail worked into its environments and graphics.\n\nI just completed everything in the Secrets of Grindea that is currently available in the version out at this time and I have to say that what they have so far is fan-bloody-tastic.\n\nThings I liked\nFantastic pixel graphics with fluid animations that make me say "wow" in some circumstances\nAn interesting story with creative sidequests and lovely characters\nHats and lots of them. I'm a Team Fortress 2 man and I found the choice of hats to be most adequate.\nThe plethora of references. I won't spoil any of them, but they're there.\nThe soundtrack consisted of fantastic tracks that all matched their locations in game. Not a single track sounded out of place in this game.\nThings I didn't like all that much\nThe story was a bit short. But that can be attributed to the fact that it's in early access.\nThe limited supply of weapons available was quite disheartening as I found myself wielding the most powerful one-handed sword in the game about 1/2 of the way through the story with not much choice on what else to use.\nPlayer customzation is unfortunately incredibly limited with the only changable things being colour of clothing, hair style, hats, and facewear. I found myself yearning for a dress but was sadly stuck with my adventurers outfit. I don't want efficieny, damn it, I want to look fabulous!\nOverall after I played through and 100% completed the game with a mate of mine we both left with a feeling of satisfaction and the desire to one day return to Grindea when more content is released. What I'm trying to say is buy the game already. It's worth it.","August 3, 2015","true","38.3"," 57 of 59 people (97%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","97","57","59","9","11"

I got this game because it was cheap, and looked kinda fun. Well, I was not really expecting to be too amused, the game looked kinda low Q and corny.\n\n6 hours later i nthe same sitting, I realized I had not eaten anything, nor had a bathroom break. Well, it was a little late.\n\n10/10 would sit in ♥♥♥♥ again.\n\nNow for a more serious review.\n\n\nThis game is 15 bucks at the time of this review.\n\nI have spent 30 on games that were NOT EVEN CLOSE to as good. I mean, after 20 minutes the game is already throwing you into a deep and fun story. after an hour you have already laughed your ♥♥♥ off more than once, and the game does a damned good job of not taking itself to serious.\n\nFor an "ARPG" with great elements from zelda, secrets of mana, and God knows what else lies ahead, it plays any RPG fan into a lifetime of fun. The game excessively reminds you it's about the grind that RPGs generally have, yet you don't feel underpowered at all when you rush through something. On the flip side - it forces you to go back and grind because you feel like you are missing something if you don't.\n\n\nPros --\n\n-Great Storyline\n-HOURS of content in a tiny little package\n-Devs clearly care about the game because it gets constant attention\n-Has parodies of all types of games (no spoilers)\n-YOU CAN FISH\n-Side story is still amazing, even in alpha/Early Access stages\n-Character options are not limited. You can be a mage, tank, DPS, or all, or a mix of whatever.\n-YOU CAN FISH!\n-Fishing has rewards\n-Fish have a purpose\n-Fish have multiple purposes\n-Fishing is seriously fun in this game\n-FISH\n-I see a ton of replay value\n\nCONS ----\n\n-No timer letting you know you have been playing for 6 and a half friggin hours straight.\n-Seriously, I can't find any cons for this game, and that scares me.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, this game is amazing.\n\nGraphics - 9.5/10 - They are amazing, a great homage to classic gaming.\nSound - 9/10 - Some sound effects are a bit overbearing at times, and if you drop the volume you miss out on the little effects.\nMusic - 10/10 - Great score. The entire game has music that keeps you going. At no point did I dislike it a bit. I almost didn't even notice myself humming to it all the time.\nGameplay - 10/10 - The gameplay is perfect. For it's genre and subs, it has all of the elements in the right place. PLUS you have so much freedom in character creation.\nControls - 9/10 - Id give it a ten, but sometimes the placement of things feels a little off. May be a bit better after you get used to it more I guess. Nothing is actually bad about them, but personally I miss keys from time to time when I need to chain things together.\n\nOverall, this game has a solid and simple 9.75/10. I mena, just buy it. You wont regret it a bit. They creators have done an amazing job, and I can't wait till this game is complete, and a sequal is in the works.","September 26, 2015","true","14.3"," 56 of 66 people (85%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","85","56","66","24","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeffyo07/recommended/269770/","jeffyo07","Man Nurse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeffyo07/","231 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTo start... I'm on the fence about this one. If steam offered a "maybe" option, I'd pick that.  It was number one on my wishlist for a long time. A LONG TIME. Having a baby this summer, so prob not gonna be able to play much games when that happens, plus the development is taking centuries on this one, so I figured I might as well enjoy what I can out of this game now since it might not happen later.\n\n\n\nThe Good: The game sings of polish and love. What is done is fantastic. It looks simply amazing and you can tell there has been a lot of talent and devotion put into what is playable. The gameplay is freaking awesome. So much diversity, so many options for builds. You can go pure range caster, you can go one handed dps build, or put points into heaving hitting two handed skills that'll take a quarter of a bosses hp down in one well timed hit. There's a lot of choice. And you can also respec at a hefty in game currency price for those who like that option. The gameplay is a 10/10. Really ace.\n\nMost pickups are shown aesthetically on your character. The hats (which is arguably the most viewable part of your character over boots and armor since your head is huge) are viewable, while the chest pieces and boots are not. It's basically just headwear and weapons. You also have the option to have "style items" which are items that always show regardless of what you have equipped. Like the witch hat look? Equip it in style, and put a better stat hat to boost you.\n\nReplayability: It's definitely there. I'll likely replay the story mode several times at least, just to try different builds. One handed, two handed, caster, etc. It'll be fun.\n\n\n\nThe Not Nearly As Good: For having been in development for many years, really, like five years, I was both surprised and disappointed at the scarcity of actual content. There are only a handful of quests. There is a laughable amount of items. For example, I went with a two hand warrior build my first playthough, and I counted five weapons. FIVE. I have all of them. And they all have the same attack animation. A swing arc in front. I was kind of picturing a little more... There are only a couple of areas in the game right now. I don't know how many more are planned but the game felt about half done progression wise to me. To give you an idea, you can fight your way across the entire map in about 15-20 minutes.\n\nThe temples are cool, but they're short! The first took me maybe 30 minutes. The second, took about 30-40. And that's it. There's two temples. I looked for side quests of which there are many, but they're short too.  For how long the temples are, I was expecting ten of them. Nope. I think story mode took me about five hours in total and I got 72% on completion. Some of that was spent mindlessly farming for combat's sake and some more of that was spent in the arena doing the two challenges over and over to get them perfect.\n\nArcade mode is another beast. I want to love it, but it honestly frustrates the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. It seems way unbalanced. It's basically a roguelite within the game. You start at level 0 and fight through small arena level maps called floors, to a boss, onto the next floor. And it's hard as balls. Hence the frustration. Take damage 3-4 times and your dead. There are NO HEALTH DROPS when fighting. You get a measly health orb when you beat the boss and progress onto the next floor, but honestly, I think the whole arcade mode just needs rebalancing, or a freaking difficulty mode option. Make it so enemies do less damage, or drop health orbs, whatever. I've played it for several hours and only gotten to floor 3 like twice. Out of what, 12? I'm frustrated when I play arcade mode.\n\nNot to mention the slow as turtle progression system associated with arcade mode. You get "essence" which you can spend to unlock perks to start arcade mode. For example you can buy the perk which unlocks a small metal sword to boost damage from 25 at start to 35. Great. Except it takes FOREVER to get the essence. They're not guaranteed drops and I maybe get one every 3-4 runs of arcade mode. And it costs ten to unlock the lowest perks? Then fifty for a second perk slot (so all your perk unlocks are useless because you can only bring one perk at a time until you unlock another perk slot) and 150 for the third and final. Good crap. This could be fixed by lowering perk costs, or guaranteeing drops based on point scores, but as of now, I could put 100 hours into the arcade mode alone before I unlocked another perk slot. Frustrating.\n\n\n\nOverall: Like I said in the beginning, I'm really torn. I absolutely adore the combat and look of this game. It's amazing. I just wish there was more of it. It really only wet my whistle. I am left wanting. The arcade mode? I want to like it, but am left.... not liking it due to the current (albeit fixable) issues I see in it. I'll rate this up, but I really recommend just waiting for release... in 2020. Then you can play the entire game at once.\n\n","February 12","true","14.4"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","32","33","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Astebrooke/recommended/269770/","Astebrooke","Astebrooke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Astebrooke/","249 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is what I've been missing since the advent of the Nintendo 64 and Playstation.  A quality, amusing, fun, multiplayer RPG that lets you be who you want to be and play with your friends.  A lot of the game is simple enough to pick up, while other aspects seem frustratingly incomprehensible (at first).\n\nThe Good:Can choose the colors of your character's clothes and hair to stand out from other players\nCan change your character's hairstyle to stand out as well\nCan not only equip masks to look different, but can equip a "style" for masks, weapons, and shields, to allow your character to look a certain way without sacrificing the stats on their gear.  Major props to the developers for that mechanic.\nHumor.  This game has plenty of it.\nActive developers who read their forums and respond to feedback.  They not only tell you what they're doing every week, they show images and animated gifs that prove it's not just hot air.\nExperience Cap - You can avoid outleveling your friends by hunting in areas that are beneath you, so you get money and items but no XP.\nArcade Mode - A randomly generated series of rooms that let you play a character with your friends and work toward the development of a town.\nPuzzles - The Temple of Seasons especially.  The use of seasons to not only affect the monsters' abilities, but also affect what can be done with the room, is amazingly well done.  Some of the other puzzles (like the bells) require a little attention to detail to figure out.  includes puzzle-related humor as well.\nFishing - Because fish!  Ok, because it's a free way to get pet food, and the time investment doesn't make it feel cheaty for the return.\nPets! - Because pets!  They don't fight for you, but you can increase your stats by feeding your pets certain items/fish.  The more they level the more food it will take, so you may wish to devote specific pets to specific traits.\nThe Not-so-Good:Characters only ever have one clothing style, regardless of colors.  Perhaps my character wants to run around in robes, while my brother's wants to run around in a martial arts outfit like the monks in Evergrind.  What if my friend's female character wants to wer a dress, impractical as they are for adventuring?  Male or female, you only get one (the same) set of clothes.\nSmall development team - While not really a bad thing, it does make the updates take a lot longer.  I applaud their desire to keep with a stable core that isn't going to lose interest and disappear during a project, but at the same time I wish they could produce updates just a little faster.  The forums show multiple offers of assistance, which are politely declined.\nArcade Mode - Every time you die, you start over at level 1.  This doesn't make for a "grind" as much as a monotonous loop of re-leveling and trying to get back to where you had been.  While being too weak in the story mode allows you to backtrack and level, or hunt cards, the Arcade Mode forces you to keep moving into progressively more dangerous territory, and one bad spawn can reset you to zero instead of just backing off and leveling some more.\nEquipment limitations - With a good drop on one of the bosses you can have one of the best 1-h weapons in the current release of the game, halfway into Story Mode.  Most caster gear is functionally limited until far into the second temple, while you can get great melee armor and weapons throughout.  Even buying all gear and dropping/crafting all\narmors as of the end of the current release, some of the most useful caster gear was either available 1/3 of the way into the game (MP regen robes) or at the end of current content (temple loot/drops).\nMonster Cards - While I do believe they are awesome and useful, I feel the benefits they grant are so powerful in some cases that you become reliant on them, rather than simply empowered by them.  To change them now might require some major balance tweaks, but Bloomo and Pecko are the two that spring to mind.  Without them I stood little chance alone in the Temple of Seasons against the mini-boss, after XP slowed to a crawl.  It seems awkward relying on those to beat a few fights...  Later in the game, unless more high-HP boosting cards are added to balance tough fights, I could see them being less useful.  For now though, they're pretty much a necessity.\nEconomy - It never really seems like you have to worry about money in this game.  By the time I stopped hunting all the cards and mob drops, I had enough money to raise my Jumpkin to level 10 purely off potions.  Buying anything else was like picking out pocket lint, for all the impact it made in my savings.\nI believe that the game has incredible potential, and is great fun as it stands now.  I've put in 41.2 hours as of the time of this writing, and most if it is in Story Mode.  I probably won't be gaining much on my play time until they release more, but I keep checking the devblog every week for updates.\n\nPixel Ferrets, I salute your game.  Keep at it.","October 13, 2015","true","43.9"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","1"

I really do. But not in this game as the grinding is rewarding and the battle system is a lot of fun.\n\nYOU DON'T HAVE TO GRIND - BUT YOU'LL WANT TOSecrets of Grindea is a 2D Action-RPG with roots in the SNES-era ARPG games such as the Mana-series and Legend of Zelda. The battles are fast and the basics are quite easy to learn. You can't just button smash your way through though. The system is very much reliant on your skills and strategies, despite the fact that you can grind for levels to overpower yourself.\n\nThe beauty of the game is that you don't have to grind an excessive amount of time, but often you'll want to. If you just want to enjoy the story and explore the world, you can advance fairly quickly through the story. Boss battles are often very tough if you're underleveled but with a correct strategy, they are very beatable without power grinding. You unlock new areas to explore by advancing the story and you are free to roam the areas you've unlocked. The enemies are visible on the map and they are all avoidable.\n\nA 2D SANDBOX WITH TON OF STUFF TO DOFor the completionists, there is a ton of optional things to do. There's fishing, potion-making, side-quests, secrets, puzzles, pet catching, pet leveling, arena-battles, crafting and a ton of mob drops that are hard to get. I myself have already spend at least 2 times more than my Steam play-time shows in this game, doing all the optional stuff. That was over a year ago when there wasn't this much new content in it yet.\n\nThe leveling system is very nice since you get points to spend on skills as you please. There is a good amount of different skills to choose from and all of them have strategic value. There is also a lot of different equipment which you can buy, craft or get as a drop from the monsters.\n\nYOU DON'T PLAY POKEMON-GAMES FOR THEIR STORYThe story isn't awful either. It's not the focus of the game nor the main reason to buy the game. It has enough meat in it to keep you motivated to go further and to give some context to your adventure but don't expect it to move you to tears or grab you emotionally. Think Pokemon games and their story and you'll know what level of story-telling to expect.\n\nAs a big fan of stories and powerful story-telling in games, I would've wanted a more compelling story-telling personally but because of the strong gameplay, the lack of PSX-era Final Fantasy-esque story telling doesn't bother me much at all.\n\nTOO LONG, DIDN'T READAll in all, this has been my #1 most anticipated indie-game since 2013, when I bought the pre-order beta. SoG is a a good balance of excellent gameplay, exploration and story. While the story is not up to par with the gameplay, the complete package is still excellent and the 3 Swedish Stooges can be proud of what they've been working on for all these years.","February 14","true","16.2"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","100","25","25","6","0"

Secrets of Mana was bar none my favorite game on the SNES.  Nothing I have played since gives quite the same feeling of grinding on rabites for hours on end to build weapon skills.\n\nNot only does Grindea have a similar battle system, but it adds several customization options, from combat skills to magic to costumes, it also adds puzzle elements and arcade modes for further challenge.  The rare loot drops keep you farming mobs and bosses, and for the meta meta minded, there are card drops from in game enemies, in game achievements, Steam achievements, and presumably down the road, Steam cards.  It's a total overload of gathering meta!\n\nIf I had to pick some complaints about the game, here they are:\n\nArcade mode - I'm not patient enough, and never get passed the first or second stage.  Gimme a heal, dammit.\n\nGreenlight - It took way too long to get Greenlight, dammit.\n\nDevelopment time - Stalking the devblog gets old after a while.  It has been way too long a wait for the complete game, dammit.\n\nI might have an issue with patience.\n\nDo yourself a favor, if you ever enjoyed overhead Nintendo games, support the devs, give this a shot.  It's only an amazing themesong and a fuzzy sprite away from being a classic.\n\nAlso, hats.

It's incredibily polished and the combat system is well refined and requires more timing and depth than other games of the same genre. While some of the ways to beat the bosses are cliche, this is not necessarily a downside because they are splendidly executed. Furthermore, there are a fair amount of bosses whose patterns/attacks the developers have taken creative liberty to make unique, unexpected, and enjoyably difficult. Characters are not class bound; rather each character has a limited number of usuable skill points and the same pool of skills they can choose from. This allows for multiple unique playthroughs on both story and arcade (roguelike) mode. I haven't found a similar game that brings forth the amount of depth, polish and nostalgia that Grindea has.\n\n","November 28, 2015","true","35.2"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","24","25","0","3"

I mean of Grindea is a great game so far, Although unfinished (As most betas are) The secret of Grindea is a homage to one of the best RPGs to the SNES, adding in it's own spin on the classic game style. The bosses are challanging, the animations and gameplay is fluid and really nice, you can fish, there are hats. All in all it's a really solid game so far, and I'm excited to see what they can do with it.\n\nThis is definitely a game to look forward to once it's complete. Although I wouldn't reccomend people buying it right now at the stage it is at unless they want that nostalgia of playing this style of game with friends. I think it's still a little too incomplete to be playable for an extended period of time... Mainly because you'll finish how much they have in the game so far fairely quick. But if the Devs read this, Keep up the good work, because if the rest of the game is as good as how much of it I have seen. And if the content of it keeps expanding so there's replayability to it this is going to be a game that brings a lot of people to it.","July 13, 2015","true","4.7"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

The whole atmosphere in this game is based of the genre RPG. This game also includes two kind of game modes. Story mode and Arcade Mode. In my personal opinion I'd recommend starting off with Story Mode. It introduces you to the game in such a good way. You'll understand the controls quickly, trust me. The game also features this Co-Op mode where you can create your own world and play together with your friends! Making a Co-Op world is not in any way Time-Consuming. You host a world, create a hero, make a password for it. Done. It's no big deal. As said above, the game also include the Arcade Mode. The goal in Arcade Mode is to beat your previous record, achieve new trophies and upgrade your town by completing quests! Though whenever you die in Arcade Mode, you will spawn in your town from the start. It's not a big deal since you will be able to upgrade your skills from the start. You can upgrade your skills and spells by achieving the so called "Essence". Essence is found when you beat enemies in Arcade Mode. By leveling up in Arcade/Story Mode, you will recieve "Skill Points". With Skill Points you will be able to powerup your attacks! This makes it easier to complete enemies and bosses faster. I'd recommend use your skill points wisely.. Upgrading the same powerup is not always the best idea. Overall, this game is just really amazing. You should definitely try this game out!\n\nLocations and Enemies:\n-Pillar Mountains > The Pillar mountains is where your journey starts. You may encounter those enemies: Green Slime, Mrs Bee, Rabby.\n-Pumpkin Woods > The Pumpkin Woods are filled with scary monsters and adventures. You may encounter those enemies: Jumpkin, Lantern Jack, Ghosty, Halloweed.\n-Flying Fortress > The Flying Fortress is an Ancient Abandoned temple that has existed in many years.. You may encounter those enemies: Brawler Bot, Guardian, Wisp, Pecko, Phase-Man (Mini-Boss), The Sentry (Mini-Boss), Gun-D4M (Main Boss).\nThat's a few locations and enemies I've listed above.

There's currently two dungeons available which looks to be about 40% of the game.\n\nOnce the game is completely finished I'll do a proper review of it but until that time, I recommend everyone stay away from it, don't give dev's money they haven't rightfully earned yet...

I did this because I felt I didn't need to know much about the game, my very first impression from the trailer and a youtube video sold me on the spot. And I can say, roughly 9 hours into the game as of this review, that my first impression was spot on. If you enjoy the classic action RPGs of the 1990's and early 2000's, such as Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Illusion of Gaia, or (obviously) Secret of Mana, then this game is for you and is well worth your time, money, and intrigue.\n\nFrom my perspective, this game offers 4 distinct areas of interest that define the experience:\nStory Mode\nArcade Mode\nMultiplayer\nThe Progression System (Skills and Talents) I will be covering all 4, explaining my experiences and impressions of each.\n\nSTORY MODEWhile a bit lacking in the engaging story aspect, Secret of Grindea's (SoG) Story Mode offers something many RPGs have failed to have for a while now: the elegance of simplicity. Many modern titles have an obsession with creating a novel's worth of narrative. Cutscene after cutscene, wall of text after wall of text, the experience of these titles are moreso about the story and presentation of it than the actual game.\n\nSoG takes the short and simple approach, where it gives enough story and narrative to provide context and motivation, but is spaced well enough where it does not feel like a chore to read through it all (having the option to skip cutscenes helps too). Not to say that the story isn't interesting, though. While simple and somewhat of a parady of other RPGs, many of the characters are likeable in their own right and their clever interactions are both entertaining and humurous. It's clear a lot of heart was put into the devolpment of this game from all of the silly and minor references to other games and characters.\n\nPutting aside the storytelling aspect of SoG, there's quite a bit of content packed into what is currently available (game is still in beta as of this review). From collectables, to crafting, to minigames, puzzles, Zelda-esque dungeons, side quests, arena challenges, and engaging and replayable boss fights, there's a lot to do. But my favorite aspects are the inclusion of a genuinely difficult hard mode that can be toggled on or off at any time and the ability to customize the look of your character in the form of hats and accessories (that override the look of your currently equipped armor).\n\nTo review:\n\nPros:\nSimple but effective narrative\nInteresting and humurous dialogue\nPlethora of activities, side quests, and minigames\nInteresting boss fights\nHard Mode\nCons:\nGame not complete (with no ETA)\nARCADE MODEArguably, this is where most of your time will go. This mode is SoG's roguelike feature, where you attempt to progress as far as you can through a serious of increasingly challenging rooms and obstacles on a single life. Much in the way of other roguelikes (such as Rogue Legacy), you have the ability the make succeeding runs easier in the form of unlocking perks. These are unlocked via a currency you obtain randomly as a drop and from completing quests and achievments.\n\nThe farther you go and the better you do, the more points you will recieve. After each death, your points are tallied up and added to your total score across all games. After certain thresholds have been met, you will revieve rewards, such as cosmetics (hats and accessories), more NPCs to interact with, and more buildings/decorations for your hub. There is also a global leaderboard for the mode, so if you're into that sort of thing you can sate your fancy here.\n\nAs for the actual content of the mode, it's challenging but rewarding. Like any other roguelikes, there are a lot of elements of randomness involved. The dungeon layout, challenges in each room, and the loot you get are all up to chance. However, this works as the combat system is based on skill moreso than raw stats. You will get farther in the dungeon because you got better rather than because you got some good luck on your drops. You find that you are excited to get as far as you can as that shows just how much better you got at the game more than anything else.\n\nPros:\nUnlockable Perks\nAchievments\nLeaderboard\nReplayability\nCons:\nCan have a somewhat harsh learning curve\nCan feel repetative at times\nLike story mode, not all of the floors are implemented yet.\nMULTIPLAYERWhile I have no personal experience with this feature myself, I have seen examples of this in videos and streams. From what I have seen, multiplayer is fairly smooth and simple to do. Multiplayer is available for both Story Mode and Arcade Mode, so if you have a group of friends you can enjoy all aspects of the game together with up to 4 people.\n\nBe that as it may, it's not perfect. Currently, there is no option to play with your friends locally. You will need to connect to each other through different computers, and each person will need to have a copy. Additionally, it lacks some quality of life functions such as being able to join someone from your friends list. And, as one would expect from online play, there can exist some connection issues and bugs (although I've yet to see any).\n\nPros:\nCan play with up to 4 people\nCan play in both Story Mode and Arcade Mode\nSmooth and stable online play\nCons:\nCan have some connection issues and bugs\nLacks QoL polish\nNo Local Play\nSKILLS AND TALENTSAn RPG needs to have some form of progression, and SoG does it with it's ability system. What makes this one stand out from the rest is its simplicity and its lack of restrictions. There are no skill trees, no level/stat requirements, you just choose the skills you like and roll with it. And so much is added to this game because of it.\n\nThere are a varity of skills that appeal to all forms of play, be it aggressive, defensive, evasive, melee, range, single target, AoE, Burst, DoT, etc. And given the lack of restrictions on obtaining skills, you can create a massive amount of different and interesting builds. Want to be an aggressive and fast melee striker? Go for it. Want to be a long-ranged magic nuker? Sure! Want to combine both melee and magic for a hybrid spellsword? That's cool too.\n\nAdditionally, a lot of the skills from different branches work well together. For instance, Static shock is a spell that will do additionally damage very time you hit with a physcial attack. You can restore charges for this skill from using physical skills or doing perfect guards, meaning this skill can be used in all kinds of builds, both offensive and defensive.\n\nWhile I would argue a need for more skills, the simplicity of the current design is also appealing and useful. While some talents prove to be more useful than others, many of the skills have their uses and can work well given the right circumsances.\n\nIn the end, what gives this game a lot of replayability, both in Story Mode and in Arcade Mode, is the progression system and the appeal of trying out new builds and tactics.\n\nPros:\nNon-restrictive\nSkills work well together\nInteresting and thoughtful effects\nEasy to make and try new builds and tactics\nSimple and easy to understand\nCons:\nSome talents not as useful as others\nArguably not enough skills to facilitate variety","July 24, 2015","true","18.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluePaw/recommended/269770/","BluePaw","BluePaw 🐾","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluePaw/","164 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor some odd reason, the game reminds me a lot of Paper Mario for the N64. I'm not exactly sure why... there's hardly any similarities.\n\nI tried the demo of this game (lead up to the arena fight), and it had me sold. I was hesitant to buy it at the time, on sale, or was released... the formar took over (and I'm glad, worth every $ and then some). This game just... pulls me in and refuses to let go. I have to pry myself away from the game! (or till I feel my bladder being full to the brim...)\n\nI picked hard difficulty as normal felt... easy for me... I have completely underestimated hard difficulty than I usually do for RPG games! At first I thought the game was just a collection of popular and maybe hardly used RPG tropes... well I'm not completely wrong. The story in the game is... interesting to say the least (up to what I reached)... at least I think there's a story? Somewhere? Maybe I overlooked it half way...\n\nThe game does encourage AND reward you for grinding/farming. I've noticed several times the spawn rate increases if it registers you grinding/farming, unlike other RPGs the spawn rate will decrease and/or would spawn mobs elsewhere instead of the spot you're on. (Looking at you MMORPG's... especially the F2P ones...) For some reason... grinding/farming isn't so trivial or boring than other games. Probably because I'm not seeing high leveled players showing me up one-hitting everything while I'm struggling (Always saw that as bad form) or the struggle isn't worth it.\n\nSome of the mobs I feel move a bit too fast for hard mode. Strong, more HP, and additional moves I understand but... some just don't pause at all. Rather have the mobs pause less than in Normal than not pausing at all. Be nice if mobs had a weakness and resistance. Having a hard time just trying to kill them with no disadvantages.\n\nThe boss fights... either the bosses need a little tweaking, the leveling system needs bit of a fix, and/or the skills need to be reworked. There's been a few boss fights that nearly made me just go to normal difficulty (I had to temporary for the sentry mini-boss due to the stupid orbs!) Either too much is going on for me to register what's happening, I'm unable to get strong enough to properly face this boss/foe, and/or the skills I have are weak than they should be.\n\nI've nearly crafted every item on the current list... on bit of a card hunt now. See cards as a reward for grinding/farming excessively as they give you benefits whether to your stats or purchases (that I've seen so far). Wish leveling actually increased your stats than just give you points to spend... I shouldn't feel so weak than I should be for (current) end-game bosses (toward Winter, Hydras, Toy Machine, etc.). Granted it's hard, but shouldn't be dark-souls difficult! (That's what it felt like most of the time after the numerous times of being frustrated at bosses to the point of nearly tossing my laptop out the one story window!!!)\n\nPick this up at its price of $15. Shouldn't wait for a sale, unless you're low on cash, to enjoy this. If you rather play a finished product than in development, then you'll be waiting for quite some time. Half of the story content is in the stable beta right now.\n\nI'll most likely either update or completely rewrite this review when the game is finished. I think I'll wait till this game is finished before I continue any further in the story though.\n\nUpdate: Tried a bit of Arcade Mode... it's not very forgiving that it discourages me. Reminds me of Rogue Legacy but harsher...","March 17","true","27.0"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

For one the amount of effort and polish here is staggering. Spritework is very detailed and charming and the animations are top notch all around. NPCs don't just sit around, they walk, talk, sneeze, cough, sigh, eat some chicken, work and more. They are all doing something and each one feels unique and goes a long way to draw you into the game world.\n\nThe gameplay is very tight and responsive. You have a robust amount of options when it comes to combat style thanks to weapon skills and various schools of magic. Specialize or mix and match, its all up to you and the game encourages it. The option to buy back level up points is a nice feature if not pricey.\n\nThe game also has tons of great design choices. Puzzle challenges let you rewind various steps of the puzzle. Pushed a block in the wrong space? No problem, step on a tile to undo it without having to reset the whole thing. And that feature is nice cause these puzzles can rack your brain on occasion. When it comes to crafting you can pin recipes your working on to your hud so you can know what you need at all times. Tons of smart game design on display here.\n\nAnd not to mention the games Arcade mode which honestly could have been a whole game by itself. Its a permadeath roguelike style experience which asks you to go into randomly generated dungeons to rack up as many points as possible in one run by not only clearing rooms but being smart and quick about it. These points go towards improving your hub town. You can also find special rare items you can cash in for permanent perks that carry over from character to character. Also this whole game has 4 PLAYER ONLINE CO-OP! For Story AND Arcade mode with various features that go with that too like competitive minigames.\n\nMy mind is blown that this is a Early Access game cause good lord its already far acceded its asking price for me. Get a copy or two for your buddies and enjoy some good old fashioned action RPG goodness. ^^","July 16, 2015","true","7.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

This game harkens back to a simpler gaming era; a time where the games had story, very fun fighting mechanics and a sense of completion and fulfillment. A few minor bugs here and there, considering it's still in its baby beta stage and maybe a few issues with enemies being overpowered in their crow control on players. This game is everything I've been wanting out of games today and just haven't been getting. As a future video game designer, Secrets of Grindea has the formula I've been looking for and want to perfect in making a game. I've gotten well over $15 worth of enjoyment out of this game and it's not even fully done yet.

I figured 17.00$ for a unfinished game might not be worth it even if it is good because it is still in early access and would have so little to the game that it is not worth it. The game looked like a higher quality indie maker game and that was not what I was interested in so I dismissed it. I wanted something that will have lots to do good gameplay and lots of replay value.\n\nI was really wrong about the game. It is so good it is a contender to be one of my favorite games of all time. The game has great replay value, online multilayer, great combat, the fishing mini game is actually okay and it has a interesting but overall funny story that is skipable.\n\nThis game have great replay value there are many different monsters that can drop up to 4 different items when you defeat them, some are crafting items sometimes you can get some armor, a sword or a shield. Sometimes you need to gather crafting items to craft a new item or you can just find a new hat, sword if you kill enough monster that drop items. You can play the game with 4 players making the game harder the more people that play but the game is still fun to play because you can spend time focusing on collecting all the items in the game. I have almost played the game over 24 hours and I still have not gathered all the items, cards, achievement and even finished the story. You can change the game from easy to hard in the middle of the game making it very fair. The game has replay value because you could replay the game to have a magic user build otr a melee user build or something like that.\n\nThe gameplay is fun there is normal and hard difficulty hard adds a few more monsters to the levels makes them more aggressive, faster and stronger. The magic in the game is fair and not overpowered like it is in other games. You have powerful magic but summoning a monster reduces your energy while your summoned monster or passive spells is out. When you level up your base stats go up and if you want extra challenge you could play the game without leveling up and for a price you can respend your points on new spells and abilities. The game does something crazy it makes it fun and gives you a reason to kill over 1000 slimes. You would want to kill the slimes for exp, money, collectibles, cards, crafting items, and even if you already have these you can sell them for money and give them to other players. And the best part is killing slimes is fun they get smarter the more you kill and if your not careful even easy monsters can hurt you.\n\nThe story is great it is funny, full of references to games like legend of Zelda other games anime movies etc. The story is interesting enough to watch a few times but thankfully you can skip it if this is your 20th time playing the game.\n\nThe game has fair DLC there is a 5 dollar hat DLC that is honest that if you play 5 dollars you will give the devs more money so if you want to support them you can. There is no cheap DLC that gives players an edge like golden armor swords or unfair things like that.\n\nThe games multiplayer is great and there is little lag for me and you can play arcade, the story, VS with other players and its not like the game needed that because the game is fun just playing by yourself.\n\nSo do I recommend this game YES it has great challenge, it has some of the best replay value I have seen in a story, the gameplay is great  the collectibles are fun and worth getting, the multiplayer have 3 fun modes VS, story and arcade ( you can also play mini games in the story with others) and they are still making the game? It is worth it for sure and when they keep this system add more content, collectibles and things like that this game would be my new favorite game of all time. I really thing you should consider buying this game for a fun game to play buy your self and a fun game to play with friends. the only posible thing that the game could add to make it better would be local multiplayer. the game has good gameplay like castle crashers, replay value and collectables somewhat like ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes and a short but sweet story.","May 1","true","71.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Though there isn't much content in the story mode which i find strange because this game has been in development for years now and they have only managed to finish two temples and a few zones (then they have the cheek of asking for money to go towards coffee breaks in the form of day one DLC) it's still a great bit of fun and the arcade mode adds a lot of replayability. I can't say i'm a fan of the fact they have placed in a online leaderboards as to me that encourages cheating and there's no way you're going to get the #1 spot unless you too cheat and then it makes it seem pointless to do if you're wanting to take part in the arcade mode for the competitive purpose of beating other players. Though this is and the current lack of content in the story mode (at the time of this build i'm sure this will change in later versions) are my only complaints about the game.\n\nThe music and sound effects are spot on and you can tell they have heavy inspiration from older RPG games and has a great nostalgic feel about it. I played through the game co-op with one friend and i have to say the net code is spot on and we had no problems with lag what so ever and the game seemed input perfect along with not being too restricted to where you can go in co-op. You and your allies still all have to commit to going to a new zone before the game takes you all there but you're not bound together when you're in that zone. The gameplay is flawless in design too and you feel like you have all the control over your character and when you ♥♥♥♥ up and die it is YOUR fault and not the game's. The game has the perfect balance of fun and challenge and the spells/abilities all seem to have their uses though some seem a lot weaker early game and some also seem a lot weaker later game so it's worth experimenting with the abilities as some may be more usefull early game but end up being weak towards the end.\n\nHighly recommend checking this gem out as it lives up to the hype and i am extremely exited in seeing what they add in future updates.","July 15, 2015","true","13.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I plan to give more insight on the details of the game once I have played more and once the game is finalized (as it is in beta/early access at the time of playing). Controls work well, story,setting and writing are both immersive and engaging with well placed humor. Game mechanics are enjoyable with combat being diverse with many options and a in depth leveling/skill system. Along with quipment leaving many diffrent options for how players what to play the game be it all diffrent types of magic, a large assortment of wepons armor and combat quipment such as bows power up potions and stat bonus rings. The visuals and music are great to hear and dont get old on long loops, puzzles are a good challenge, enemies and bosses are fun to fight while still being the right amount of difficult at times. There is alot of good to say about the game and as I play more and the game becomes finalized I will due a more in depth review. If this looks like the type of game you would enjoy I would highly recommend it.","December 28, 2015","true","12.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Over 100 hours in fact. It is ridiculously charming and tons of fun.\n\nSome things to keep in mind though...\n\nYou know that "grind" in the title? If you want to complete everything there is definitely grinding. I like mindless grindfest from time to time so it wasn't a draw back for me, might be for you though.\n\nAlso, it is not finished. It is clear that the game is a labor of love for the team of three and it certainly shows in both the charm of the game and the length of time it will take to create. Again... this isn't a problem for me I knew that going in and the developer blog on their site shows you their weekly progress so you know they are working on it again its just 3 folks, but don't both if you are the type to say "this isn't even early access"... because it is even early access, just way earlier than you want it to be. At this point looks like the story content is about halfway done.\n\nThe downsides out of the way, I want to reiterate that it is a blast and if you are not a negative nancy about playing a game still in development buy it now and have at it. As said by other reviews it is a secret of mana/link to the past style game that is very tongue-in-cheek regarding rpg tropes.","January 1","true","156.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I absolutely love co-op RPGs, and this ARPG has potential. It has a Secret of Mana/A Link to the Past vibe, and after trying out the free demo, I immediately bought it. While the game is still in early access, there is plenty to do. Once you run though the story (as far as you can, it's still in development), there are likely still items to craft, a pet to level to increase your stats, and an arcade mode that is challenging and addictive. As of right now, the game has controller support for a wired 360 controller, and you can use software to bind buttons of other controllers to specific keys, so you can make different controllers work (I'm using the PS4 controller) - the game feels great with a controller, so it's definitely worth doing if the keyboard set-up just isn't working for you.\n\nI strongly recommend at least trying the free demo - as there's nothing to lose. It's a relatively small download, and while  you could probably rush through pretty quickly, if you take your time to explore and take things in a little, you'll get a decent amount of content for a demo. The demo can also be played cooperatively, so it's probably worth trying to get a friend or two (or three, if you can) to try it with you!","August 3, 2015","true","33.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I did everything possible in story mode and it took me almost exactly 15 hours to do so which isn't too bad. Arcade mode is very difficult I almost never made it to level 2 on single player but I'm sure with more people this game would become a blast. I found the story mode much more enjoyable as some of the characters are hilarious. Anyone would find this game fun the only down sides are that it’s still being developed and hence you can only do the first 2 of 5 temples. It will defiantly be a good game in the future right now though I'm not sure if it’s worth $16 seems a little pricey for 15 hours of gameplay but either way if you don't mind the price for an incomplete game defiantly buy it or even if you have doubts try the demo that's what I did the game will kind of hook you into it.","November 22, 2015","true","0.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LuggyLinguine/recommended/269770/","LuggyLinguine","luggy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LuggyLinguine/","184 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(Note: Review made after playing through around 50% completion of the beta with 2 other friends.)\n\nSecrets of Grindea is an action rpg that takes cues from top down Legend of Zelda games and Secret of Mana games.\n\nYou run around, fight monsters, and use hotkeyed spells while wearing cool hats.\n\nThe music is well, nothing that stands out to me though. (Yet!)\n\nIt features a very large amount of items to collect, craft, and fight with (even in the beta, I feel) and quite a few spells, passives, and skills to play with.\n\nThe game's story revolves around you and up to 3 other friends adventuring around the world, gathering gear and fighting monsters so you can become the best hoarder in the whole world.\n\nI can break down the gameplay into 4 types; Boss fighting, Enemy Fighting, Crafting and Exploring/Puzzles.\n\nNow, I wouldn't say the bosses are bad, hell, some even verge into the point of having so many projectiles on the screen you could swear you are playing a bullet hell, and are still well made, but i'd say that the bosses have way too much hp.\n\nExamples of this are the "Raging Toy Machine" Boss (I think that is what it is called?) which has too much hp and spams too many projectiles at once to even revive your friends, such as lines of dropping bombs, random dropping bombs, spawning monsters that also spawn bombs, normal monsters that charge at you, and a floor hazard that sends a toy train at you at random angles (Since the tracks on the floor constantly change direction) all at the same time. Also, another boss guilty of this would be a certain cube boss that deals insane amounts of damage but is somewhat easy to dodge, yet has crazy amounts of health. Some normal enemies have this problem too, such as the Yeti monsters. I suggest that the Toy Machine Boss has either less hp, or spams less things. Perhaps remove the bombs it drops?\n\nEnemy fighting is pretty fun, some monsters dodge, some use projectiles, some shield other monsters, it has a nice amount of spice without overdoing it. However, I do not like the damage sponge nature of the Sky Dungeon's Birds, and the Snow area's Yetis.\n\nI feel that the crafting can be improved in the way that some drops are extremely rare, instead of having the drops be really rare, make it so the drops are semi-rare or drop from the monsters in specific areas/quests, but have to pay certain amounts of money to actually craft the gear. The better the gear, the more money you would pay. It would solve the problem in that more often then not, shops have either way better gear then what you currently have, or junk gear that you can't improve or craft with, or, as another suggestion, make it so the gear shops sell basic gear that can be improved into better items. (Some gear from stores already does this, but it would be better if more gear could be upgraded.)\n\nExploring areas is usually rewarded well, along with treasure maps that give you either image hints or riddles to where the treasure is buried, and some puzzles that involve pushing blocks around into a certain area to open a door. (More fun then it sounds.)\n\nAnother thing to mention is the pixel art style of this game is extremely pleasing to the eye, and the animation is very fluid and appealing to watch. It's also worth noting most npc's do things such as farming and shoveling snow, which adds a bit of life to the game. The monsters are also, very well animated.\n\nSomething that I do not like, is that in online gameplay, only the host will have the quests completed on their side. Therefore, playing the game by yourself after doing some quests with a friend, means you will have to go through those quests again in singleplayer if you wish to do so. I suggest to the devs that they make it so if the group finishes a quest, all players main story should be updated to reflect that, so they do not have to go through the quests again. Also, it's worth noting you cannot get quest rewards more then once, meaning, if you do it online with a friend, go to single player, and do the quest again, you cannot get the item from finishing that quest again.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game even in it's beta state, I have not run into any bugs or problems quite yet, and I feel the game will be even better once more content, polish, and balancing is added to the game.","August 18, 2015","true","10.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It is simple to play and easy to learn, yet it has a lot of depth involved in it so that it doesn't feel shallow. There are no bugs, no crashes.. multiplayer worked seemlessly from the first time I tried and every time since. If you plug and unplug a controller in while the game is running, it changes over flawlessly with no hiccups. The music is fantastic and the graphics are fun and colorful!\n\nBesides the few things missing from the game that the developers plan to add before it's out of early access, you can hardly tell that it's not a finished game.

So i don't really have alot of negative things to say about it.\n\n10/10 I can't wait to see it finished\n\nIt plays alot like seiken densetsu 3 meets Zelda.\n\nPros:\n*beautiful custom maps that flow nicely with the tiling and sprites\n*the attention to detail on the sprites is impressive\n*the amount of animation really makes the game alot more lively. Every map is loaded with different animations to give each area it's own unique feel.\n*the mechanics are perfect, I have no complaints there.\n*the option for story and arcade mode\n*there is an monster arena!\n*good scaling difficulty for multi-player.\n*crafting system in place that unlock as you discover new items.\n*trophy room to replay boss battles\n*fishing, which is nicely incorporated into the arcade mode to help acquire loot.\n*summons, pets and familiars!!\n*I'm sure I missed a bunch of other things to point out in the game.\n\nCons:\n* it's not finished and I'm impatient!\n* to short at the moment, and not enough replay yet. (arcade mode gets dull after a few hours.)\n\nBugs:\n*not really bugs but the gigaslime and peckos animation are the wrong ones in the card index. I think it's a regular slime and the peckos doll for thier animation.\n\nSuggestions:\n*Infinite scaling dungeon!! (star ocean style!)\n*monster catching and breeding for the arena! (ff10 style!)\n*add in the multi-player games asap, even before more single player content to increase replay value. (think Mario party!)\n*PVP arena of some kind.

Sure its a little bit timewasting, but you do not have to go 24/7 mode.\n\nStory mode is very short and the game is not worth buying if thats all you wanna do (for now).\nHowever the arcade mode is a truly good "timewaster" if you have nothing else to do and makes it all worth it, its not an expensive game after all and is fun, if restarting every time you die is something you like.\n\nI'd give this game a 6/10 in overall rating due to the short story which I guess will get alot more in the future!","November 18, 2015","true","24.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

While still an early access game at the time of writing, there is more than enough content to justify the fifteen dollar price tag. With an easy to learn combat system and the lack of distinct classes, combat feels smooth and genuinely fun, as one would hope a game with the term "grind" in the title would boast. Likewise, the characters are for the most part interesting, if perhaps not always particularly memorable.\n\nThe characters of Grindea tend to alternate between totally forgettable and completely memorable. Your talking loot bag, appropriately named Bag, your close friend Luke, and your somewhat obnoxious rival Marino all manage to establish themselves with completely memorable characteristics - Bag is very cynical and sarcastic, with what appears to be an mix of disinterest and dislike for all things not labeled Very Rare Loot. Luke, meanwhile, is a hardworking powerhouse of a boy, but isn't particularly bright. Marino is a rich, bratty noble, and while that's not particularly deep as a character, he does a good job of making it memorable. On the other hand, quest giver Quinton, a couple of clearly reoccuring, almost Team Rocket - esque thugs, and even the player character's own father all seem to have virtually no personality. In the interest of fairness, these characters haven't recieved nearly as much screentime as Bag, but the problem is that the charcters I found memorable made themselves memorable from the first meeting, whereas all of these less memorable characters have appeared at least twice and still have yet to make any sort of impact on me.\n\nCombat in Grindea, as I mentioned above, is a very easy concept to grasp, if a little hectic in practice. The Z key is your basic melee attack with whatever is equiped to your weapon slot, X raises your shield, and the A,S,D,F,C, and V keys all bind to the various special attacks and spells you pick up over the course of the game. This means that a solid blend of melee and magical combat is more than plausible, although the effort to make that blend work is probably more than a strictly melee or magical style. That being said, the only character I've made so far is very focused to the ice branch of magic, and so I am unable to comment on how balanced the various skills are as of now. Despite this, it's worth repeating that the combat system itself is very enjoyable, and the more polished parts of the game are an immense pleasure to play.\n\nHowever, it's also worth repeating that this is an early access game, and it began to become extraordinarily obvious when I was coming close to the end of the story mode content simply because the majority of the major fights became seriously unbalanced towards solo players. Perhaps it becomes less of a headache with coplayers in the mix, but one particularly noteworthy boss fight required me to keep putting damage on the boss while at the same time destroying remarkably resilient minions that were spewing poisonous gas across the battlefield. Forget to put enough pressure on the boss, and he will fully heal his minions and render them invulnerable until you go back to putting damage on the boss himself. As a solo player, the task was almost too much for me to handle, and I was only able to scrape by thanks to the points I'd put into my summonable snow golem. I don't take issue with the idea behind the boss fight, but it's more than evident that the devs have yet to find an appropriate balance that challenges a group of playeres and still remains manageable for solo players.\n\nThat fight notwithstanding, coming closer to the end of story mode also saw a lot of interesting puzzles and challenges spring forth. There's a dungeon in which the changing of the seasons is required to open up different paths to progress, and there's a sequence closer to the end of the existing content in which a teleportation power from earlier is used to cross elaborate labrynths of cannons, using mirrors and timed launches to get across. While difficult, I found myself enjoying the sequence, and look forward to seeing how the puzzles might further develop with the release of future content.\n\nAll in all, Grindea is a fun game that is definitely worth the price, despite it's glaring flaws, and it shows a lot of potential in where it can go from here. While not yet finished, it's a very enjoyable product and looks to be a fantastic game in the making.","April 13","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They have captured the old SNES games 100%.  No cheese, no lameness, no clunky interface, no tryhard here,, just a great title.  My only problem with Zelda III and Secret of Mana is that both games had an ending, they were so good.  Those games are timeless, and the graphics hold through even today due to the art style etc...   Secrets of Grindea continues in thier tradition and I just love it, there are a few throwback references but they don't overdo it (like a lot of games do).   Even though it's still Beta, early access, etc... I hope they continue to produce content in the form of DLC forever.

While the mechanics are simple to grasp, there are many unique bosses and mobs that require certain nuances to accomplish.\nThe leveling system works out relatively well. It never feels like an over the top grind (hah) until about halfway through, where it suddenly starts to feel like it takes longer to level based upon the monster EXP.\nPerhaps my only real complaint about the game lies in the skill system. They've set it up so that you get silver and gold spell points, where you spend so many silver points before you may only place gold points to further level up a skill. After spending 17 hours in the game, I've only been able to get one skill all the way up with gold points, as you only receive one point every few levels.\nStill, you can completely customize your hotkeys, and they made it quite easy and intuitive. Though it is early access, they've already thought of many convenience things that other games miss: equipping cosmetic items for free, pets that increase stats, NPCs that have witty responses, etc.\nIt's rare you find an unfinished game that leaves you thinking about it even while you're in the middle of working, exercising, and trying to sleep. I'm only sad it isn't finished! 9.5/10\n\nTL;DR - Buy this game. I'd regret not trying it. Smooth graphics, intuitive gameplay, conveniency in the game, and some light humor!

However it also adds in some nice new shiny features, the biggest one being build customization. I guess the closest comparison on the build system would be something like Skyrim or Kingdoms of Amular: Reckoning (as in non linear, pick whatever you want but there's still progression within each).\n\nThe controls are responsive however being an old goat I got hand cramps after the first hour and switched to Xbox 360 controller and enjoyed it a lot more after that (could still probably be solved with some manual rebinding). It's a little quirky to get used to the menu controls being that it behaves exactly like an old SNES title (no mouse, nested menus button press down and back up).\n\nThe dialogue is pretty funny, it has a lot of fourth wall humor often poking fun at itself and the genre. So far the score is decent but I'm only a few hours in.\n\nI got a few friends to buy it and we've been playing together and having a blast, the steam integration makes this super easy. You can choose whether to scale the leveling or not which seems nice but hasn't actually been tested by me yet, we're all pretty low level so I didn't see the point. Also loot options can be customized I didn't bother though as round robin seemed to work, the nice thing is it seems that if you haven't got a chest yet in story mode and another player opens it up you still get it. It doesn't seem to scale the enemies much in 2 player, so you can sort of cheese some content by ressurecting a downed player, but you have to time it properly so I guess it's not the end of the world. Oh and other than that, there's no healing in the game beyond picking up a certain drop (sort of like old Mega-Man games).\n\nI was nervous buying on early access but feel that this genre was worth the investment, we don't see many and I was pleasently suprised by the quality of this early access and the decent amount of difficulty in the game, you'll probably die quite a bit, but it's pretty fair. So yeah would recommend.\n\nEDIT: After playing with 3 the difficulty does indeed scale, though perhaps not enough I removed the con from the list.","July 20, 2015","true","7.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can build your character in many ways, like pure melee, pure magic or maybe mixed and the fighting system is fun. You can even change the your way of the character you have to pay for it much ingame money but at a later point of the game you have enough to do it. After the main story you can just go to the arcade mode but the arcade mode itself is fun for a long time and the quests there are good too. You can choose between Hard and Normal mode, I chose the hard mode and it was very difficult the boss fights were very close but I did them and then i played on normal mode and this is for the newcomers :) Actually the game is not very long because it's early access...

Many references, fun story and gameplay but tough as nails bosses.\n\n[Some minor spoilers ahead, be warned]\nWhat is good about this game:\n- Being able to select the visual appearence of one item while keeping the stats of another if you choose. No longer must you choose between style and function. You want a chicken hat with the protection of an iron helmet? you got it.\n- So many references. In my 7 hours I have notices 3 Pokemon references, a Mario reference, multiple Legend of Zelda references, 2 South Park references, a LITERAL Gundam boss, a well-known youtuber cameo in character and probably multiple more that I have missed.\n- Funny dialogue and interesting characters.\n- Impressive variety of skills to learn and base your playstyle on. (Several elements with 3 spells each plus many one and two handed weapon skills)\n\nWhat is bad/can be improved:\n- Menus are a bit annoying. For example if I want to make something and I lack the items needed, I can see if I have enough of item A, if I need more of item B or if I havent discovered Item C, BUT It will not tell me how much MORE of item B I need, which is a bit annoying. The difference between Silver points, Gold points and Talent orbs could also be explained better. I got a fair way into the game before realising what Talent orbs were and that I could spend them.\n- Some of the bosses feel a bit like Bullet Hells, and it can be VERY frustrating having to redo bosses over and over again since you keep dying to an onslaught of attacks on the screen. Maybe this is intended and I'm just not used to the difficulty, but I think if it is impossible to beat a boss with 1hp, you are doing something wrong as the boss is becoming less Skill based and more Luck based (such as the Winter boss, where he teleports several times and creates multiple ice pillars while launching fists of snow. He can effectively box you in to a point where you end up being hurt by his fist because you cannot move, or by the spikes as you try to avoid said fist. Or the Present machine where you have 6 presents, multiple bombs falling from the ceiling and several trains moving past).\n- Block mechanics can be improved slightly. I find myself taking damage if I drop my shield after an attack, even if the enemy has moved back or the projectile has vanished.\n\nI have high hopes for this game and hopefully this game is finished into the masterpiece it has the potential to be, and isn't another forgotten Early Access game.","July 30, 2015","true","29.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's really no reason to grind if you don't feel like it. The grinding aspect works well though, the longer you stay in one area and the more enemies you kill, the faster they start spawning with some of them being stronger "elite" versions of normal enemies. So the difficulty starts ramping up and it can get pretty chaotic after a short while.\n\nLots of fun with friends, just be aware that it is early access - not all of the game zones or skills are implemented but the core gameplay and mechanics are solid already.\n\nWe've yet to finish the story mode and we haven't tried arcade mode yet.

A very Zelda-esc game that you can play with friends. Bought after playing the demo, I highly reccomend you give the demo a shot at the very least because this is one of the rare early access games that has been worth while for me.\n\nEDIT* I've now put nearly 50 hours in to this game, purchased the game for two of my friends and currently have about 6 friends who've told me they've enjoyed the game, I've been playing with various people with very few problems. (The only real problem worth mentioning is the ping as it is something that needs fixing; some of my friends with bad connection have had their ping sky rocket in the thousands. But with a stable - decent internet it's fine, (In the campaign you can simply drop back into the game). I believe this is only an issue simply due to the fact that it's still early in it's developement, that is my only real complaint as of the time of this review).\n\nMost of my time so far has been in the arcade mode, (Since the campaign is still in development) it's really been a blast. The arcade mode is essentially a rouge type side game that you can play endlessly, sharpening your skills, asending a randomly generated mountain, while gaining points to build your very own village. (It's also a 4 person co-op like the campaign, did I mention you can earn hats?). The game at is core is flawless, the mechanics are great, the fighting feels exciting, the npc's require some thought and strategy. I absolutely love this game, I cannot wait to see the finished version. This is one of the few, if not the only Early Access game I will ever reccomend (Unless something drastic happens to  current early access trends). If you like retro rpg's with(or without)  friends, please give this game a go.","July 17, 2015","true","50.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TylerTheDragon/recommended/269770/","TylerTheDragon","Tylerthedragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TylerTheDragon/","66 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSecrets of Grindea is an action RPG that hones many aspects from RPGs that I know and love. I will be going into a lot of detail about the game and why I love it so much, so hold on to your seats!\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game has a story mode and an Arcade Mode. The story mode is currently unfinished (along with the Arcade Mode), but the game currently boasts a lot of sidequests and collectables along with the story. I have managed to collect almost all of the cards (the rarest collectables in the game, one unique to all normal enemies) as of the 15th of July and I continue to collect even more in the future when I have the time and patience to do so! The game features many sidequests, puzzles and hidden items to find and collect, which required thinking and pure potential in your combatting skills. Currently, the game is very difficult in its Arcade Mode and Hard Mode of the story.\n\nArcade Mode is the true challenge of the game and the main feature that people will come back to after beating the story. Similar to many roguelike indie games such as The Binding of Isaac and many more titles, the game offers a mode that offers permanent death and restarting all over again upon death, which will truly test your skills. Many of the enemies are buffed up versions of monsters seen in the later parts of the story, beefed up bosses from the story mode and some completely unique enemies that are not (yet) available in the story mode. For anybody who likes roguelike games, this is for you! This also is a good option to play the game without the story being spoiled for yourself if you would like to play the story from the beginning until the end with no interuptions!\n\nFor you bustling people with many friends, both modes offer multiplayer aspects, but more people doesn't come with no risk. More players often means newer moves (at least in the story mode) and higher enemy HP, that truly will test your skill instead of making the game a breeze.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack of the game isn't extremely special, but the music fits the game very well and really creates the mood of the game. Often faster-paced/more upbeat versions of the songs in the story mode are used in Arcade Mode corresponding to the area that they are found in. The music is definitely highly atmospheric and I definitely reccomend the soundtrack for any outer-game listening purposes!\n\nDesign/Artwork\n\nThe art of the game is very detailed and is drawn to a great extent. All of the places in the game are drawn in photoshop and in good detail. Sprites and other things are done seperately but the game blends in and really feels alive. Many of the animations used in the game are done very well and the artwork to follow the characters are also done to perfection. The game is crisp and looks good all the time!\n\nOverall Rating\n\nI think this game is possibly my favourite game I've played in a very very long time, and the game isn't even finished yet. I would definitely reccomend this game to anybody who wants a good game!\n\nRating:\n9.5/10\n\n+ Great Visuals and Animations\n+ Replayability is done very well\n+ Challenging compelling gameplay\n+ Completionists Lucid Dream\n\n- Some game artwork scaled down and doesn't look as good as the original\n- The game isn't out yet, not the full experience yet.\n\nIf you would like to form your own opinion, there is also a Demo. If you would like to support the developers more, you can get some higher tiers that unlock some extra rewards for your purchase, including helping development ideas and even your own NPC in the game!\n\nI also run the Subreddit! It's currently under high construction and is not as good as possible, but this will hopefully change soon!","July 14, 2015","true","54.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you like intense combat that actually requires you to stay on your toes at all time, I really recommend this game. Even though it is an early access game, and that a lot (if not the majority of EA games) just aren't worth it, trust me on this one, this one really is.\n\nPros:\n- Even though it's an ea game theres at least 5-10 hours of gameplay in the story mode so far.\n- Beautiful artwork.\n- Engaging combat system, with a variety of classes/skills that will make you wanna play it for a second time, just to test them out.\n- The story itself is fairly interesting and you'll most likely have a good laugh every now and then.\n- A big variety in the monsters and bosses, most of them function in different ways, making the game more interesting and not repetitive.\n- You can play with up to 4 friends, choosing whichever character you've saved. (There's I believe, 9 save slots atm)\n- Once you've played through whats been released in the story mode, you can just jump over to the arcade mode, which is sort of like a rougelike mode, which is super fun and addictive.\n- There is also a crafting system where you can craft weapons and armors.\n- There's a pet system, as for now it is pretty useless, but it is fairly fun to play around with.\n\nCons:\n- It's an unfinished game, you will get to the point where there is no more content story wise and at that point you will be crying, begging for more.\n- I don't know if it's meant to be, but the crafting system is pretty useless in the arcade mode, since you never get enough materials to actually craft anything.\n- There's not that huge of a variety in items. There's a few for each class and so on, but after a few playthroughs the items will be a bit repetetive.\n\nOverall, if you like rpg style games, killing monsters, completing quests, fighting epic boss battles and taming crazy rabbits, then this game is definitely for you.

Not a bug in sight, and there is plenty of game to sink your teeth into here. I was leary of the price, but its definately worth it. This is a throw-back to some great games of fairly long ago. I definately feel some heavy SNES Zelda and Secret of Mana vibes here. Like those, it also has some fairly heavy MetroidVania elements where you will be backtracking through the open world to access areas you previously couldn't.\n\nPros:\n+Great artwork.\n+Great feel to it - it plays really well. Controller support and rebindability is great in this title.\n+Music is fitting to this style, and is not generic - it is its own thing.\n+Awesome level of RPG character customizability.\n+Loads of quests even now. I love the treasure maps. Lots of sidequests, and they are all well done.\n+Even though the light 'grinding' humor is there - the game never really feels that grindy (ironically enough lol).\n+I love when the characters clothes/hair/etc. is customizable and changes with changing items.\n+Storyline is well written - I am not skipping through it yet ;)\n\nCons:\n-Online multi is awesome but I really wish they would add local so I don't have to purchase a second copy for my wife to play.\n-Hurry up and finish the unfinished zones already :D !!!\n\nIf this sounds like something you would like - I guarantee you will not be disapointed with this even in Early Access.\n","August 9, 2015","true","6.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","1"

Now saying and doing are 2 different things and only time will tell, but for this moment I enjoy this game.

I played it during EA, my initial reactions to it were lukewarm and it didn't feel worth the money. I have played the game since and it STILL didn't feel worth the money. That's all you're going to get.\n\nWhat's important to note here is that I had a pretty in-depth review about this game, that could have informed consumers before purchase, and now I don't. Now it's just  a thumbs down because the community around this game are irritating and I feel that offering any kind of information about it, is supporting it in some kind of way. Every time I logged into steam and saw a message notification, it was about this game - someone whining about how I didn't review it right, or I just "suck" at it, or - my favourite - am somehow obligated to continuously update a review on a game I do not play anymore.\n\nSo yeah, don't buy it because I don't like it because reasons.","July 18, 2015","false","13.4"," 212 of 423 people (50%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","50","212","423","24","0"

The combat is fluid, more so than that of Legend of Zelda and equipping a Two-Handed weapon does not take away your ability to use a shield.\n\nThe character sprites are amazing and dynamic, you rarely find an NPC doing nothing physically as most have a nice implemented action to make themselves seem more lifelike. Ones that you find in-game that do this range from flipping their hair, kicking a wagon, turning a crank, and even sipping tea or sneezing. It makes the world come to life more and each NPC has their own individual character portrait to show that they aren't just faceless boring no-name people in the lush world of Grindea.\n\nSkills take another aspect of the game in that they ARE diverse but there isn't a lot of them. Your main weapons will consist of a sword, either one-handed or two-handed and that is the limitation of your weapons. You will find others such as a bow and arrow while exploring but that is just a side weapon which left me wanting a more diverse weapon system. I wish there were more weapons such as a double headed spear that an enemy NPC had or even another skill branch for the bow and arrow but alas there is none.\n\nThe world of Grindea itself is nice and all the sprites are beautiful and amazing, however that does not excuse the games limited exploration. Throughout my playthrough I had tried to explore numerous pathways to other parts of the world only to be stopped by an invisible wall and a text box saying. "You can't go there! That part of the game is not yet implemented." This kills exploration as there is only on path you can take instead of being able to explore the world as you like which leads me wanting more.\n\nFor the price of 14.99$ this game is not bad, and is actually amazing. I just wish that there was more diversity in weapons and one pet peeve of mine is that equipment (such as gloves, shoes, or armor) does not show to change the characters clothes as if appearing invisible. That being said however, this game is not worth 15$ but IS worthy of your time as the world of Grindea is still being made, hopefully once finished it will be worth its expensive price.","January 12","true","2.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There really isn't enough I can say about this game, the multiplayer is crafted perfectly, with drop in/out features enemy difficulty increasing with each additional player not just increases in attributes but additional skills for bosses etc.\n\nVery indepth character leveling, allows you to create and mold your hero as you please, so you can find your perfect build. The story mode is probably about 50 percent complete, by the time i reached the end i was really yearning for more. There are tons of collectibles and several mini games including pets. Perfect game for the kind of person that loves additional content after the story, especially those who enjoy some grinding.\n\nFor those tired of playing in the story, there is a very well crafted arcade mode that is of course also multiplayer and has almost infinite replayability.\n\nThe real seller with this game though is the combat, which takes you back to old school SNES 2D top-down games like Link to the past and Secrets of Mana, but it is so much more then that. Once you find a build you enjoy whether you're just sitting back grinding enemies or facing the highest difficulty challenges, time just flies by.\n\nAs you can tell I highly recommend this game. There is a demo available which definitely gives you enough of a taste of the game to understand my high praise.","September 9, 2015","true","66.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I got pretty excited when I saw that this game had a demo (including the multiplayer I might add), I played the demo for about 3 hours with and without a friend, and it hooked me the moment I stepped out into startington.  The music is top tear, the pixel art is astounding, the gameplay is crisp and challenging, and the game world has been the first to charm me this much since The Legend of Zelda Windwaker.  So far, I LOVE this game.  The game doesn't take it self very seriously, but there is still loads of meaning behind what you are doing in a world you actually care about, I want to catch every fish, get every pet, complete every quest, collect every item, and I want to be there to watch the story unfold.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazolasyee/recommended/269770/","kazolasyee","Kazolas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazolasyee/","147 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(This review is based solely on the Story mode)\nThis is an extremely promising 2D ARPG early access game that I absolutely adore. It is by no means close to being finished but it has an incredibly solid foundation. The first thing I need to mention is the art style is phenomenal and the game has one of my favorite soundtracks of any game out there. As I'm writing this review, my character is in the Flying Fortress just so I can listen to the music. The music gives me Final Fantasy vibes that I love. Let me also mention that the art in this game is awesome. The game is full of color and it's a beautiful game to look at.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, there are many choices to be made. There are skill sets for 1H or 2H weapons and the magic is divided into fire, ice, earth, and air (which should be called lightning...). There are no classes so you can mix and match between all of these sets (For example, you can be a 2H user that also specializes in ice spells. If you freeze an enemy, you are guarenteed your next physical attack to crit).\n\nSo far, there are 2 dungeons in the game that both have very strong themes and art styles. There is not a single part of this game I dread going through. I loved Tales of Symphonia but I HATED some of those dungeons/temples (especially the sewers, oh god). Let me also mention that the second dungeon has a mechanic involving changing seasons that I have never seen before in any game. Watching the whole room change colors is quite the thing to see. My only issue with the dungeons are that they are too short. I WANT MORE.\n\n-There are 6 notable bosses in this game and they are all designed very well each offering very different strategies to conquer them.\n-Each type of enemy has a small chance to drop a card which gives your character small permanent bonuses (5% discount at shops, Atk/MAtk/Def buffs, AtkSpd and CastSpd buffs, etc)\n-"Farming" is very easy in this game. If you kill a group of enemies, stick around for about 2 more minutes fighting enemies and the spawn rate at that location will increase like crazy. There's a room in the toy factory that will spawn endless amounts of presents for you to kill repeatedly. I probably did it for a solid 30-45 minutes and it was great!\n-This game also features Arcade mode which is essentially a rogue-like version of the game. It's pretty darn hard but fun I suppose. I haven't played it enough for the purpose of this review though.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing more updates for this game. Not sure if you want to buy it yet? No biggie, PLAY THE DEMO!\nThanks for reading! I will update this review once more updates come out.","August 27, 2015","true","25.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

I've done a brief solo run and am currently doing a run with a friend and it's really enjoyable. The abilities have good variety, nothing is particularly overpowered and there's a good amount of mechanics. So far there's a pretty nice variety in side quests, and nothing feels too tedious. My only issue would be how purposely dislikeable some characters are, though this is more of an annoyance than an issue with the game itself.

There really isn't enough I can say about this game, the multiplayer is crafted perfectly, with drop in/out features enemy difficulty increasing with each additional player not just increases in attributes but additional skills for bosses etc.\n\nVery indepth character leveling, allows you to create and mold your hero as you please, so you can find your perfect build. The story mode is probably about 50 percent complete, by the time i reached the end i was really yearning for more. There are tons of collectibles and several mini games including pets. Perfect game for the kind of person that loves additional content after the story, especially those who enjoy some grinding.\n\nFor those tired of playing in the story, there is a very well crafted arcade mode that is of course also multiplayer and has almost infinite replayability.\n\nThe real seller with this game though is the combat, which takes you back to old school SNES 2D top-down games like Link to the past and Secrets of Mana, but it is so much more then that. Once you find a build you enjoy whether you're just sitting back grinding enemies or facing the highest difficulty challenges, time just flies by.\n\nAs you can tell I highly recommend this game.

The Devs are always updating it. Im currently 12 hours in on my first account, finshed the first beta stage of the story and I'm still finding things to do. (There is also a hard but rewarding arcade mode where you have to go through stages or floors battling enemies and bosses) The story is interesting and alot of it has yet to be revealed.\nIf you have read this far, you are doing something wrong, you haven't brought the game!","July 24, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

BUT, from what you can play, there is easily 20+hours of gameplay. I'm about 60 percent done with things i can do and about 15 hours in. The gameplay was surprisingly good, there are MANY different talent/skill specs that you can do. The combat is well done and smooth, I had started with a fire mage skill spec and next character i will try a 2 handed skill spec. There is still plenty i can do and want to do. This is one of the best games ive played in a long time. Well worth the 15 dollars. Try the demo if you want, then you'll see for yourself how well made this game is.","August 1, 2015","true","25.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I got pretty excited when I saw that this game had a demo (including the multiplayer I might add), I played the demo for about 3 hours with and without a friend, and it hooked me the moment I stepped out into startington.  The music is top tear, the pixel art is astounding, the gameplay is crisp and challenging, and the game world has been the first to charm me this much since The Legend of Zelda Windwaker.  So far, I LOVE this game.  The game doesn't take it self very seriously, but there is still loads of meaning behind what you are doing in a world you actually care about, I want to catch every fish, get every pet, complete every quest, collect every item, and I want to be there to watch the story unfold.  Play this game with a friend and have so much fun that 6.5 hours go by like 60 minutes.  Devs if you keep this up, the game will marvel even it's inspirations (Secret of mana SNES) and (A Link to the Past SNES)  I would 100% reccomend this game right now, even if it's unfinished what has been here so far has been totaly worth the $15, grab a friend or 3, or play solo!","August 7, 2015","true","16.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is by no means close to being finished but it has an incredibly solid foundation. The first thing I need to mention is the art style is phenomenal and the game has one of my favorite soundtracks of any game out there. As I'm writing this review, my character is in the Flying Fortress just so I can listen to the music. The music gives me Final Fantasy vibes that I love. Let me also mention that the art in this game is awesome. The game is full of color and it's a beautiful game to look at.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, there are many choices to be made. There are skill sets for 1H or 2H weapons and the magic is divided into fire, ice, earth, and air (which should be called lightning...). There are no classes so you can mix and match between all of these sets (For example, you can be a 2H user that also specializes in ice spells. If you freeze an enemy, you are guarenteed your next physical attack to crit).\n\nSo far, there are 2 dungeons in the game that both have very strong themes and art styles. There is not a single part of this game I dread going through. I loved Tales of Symphonia but I HATED some of those dungeons/temples (especially the sewers, oh god). Let me also mention that the second dungeon has a mechanic involving changing seasons that I have never seen before in any game. Watching the whole room change colors is quite the thing to see. My only issue with the dungeons are that they are too short. I WANT MORE.\n\n-There are 6 notable bosses in this game and they are all designed very well each offering very different strategies to conquer them.\n-Each type of enemy has a small chance to drop a card which gives your character small permanent bonuses (5% discount at shops, Atk/MAtk/Def buffs, AtkSpd and CastSpd buffs, etc)\n-"Farming" is very easy in this game. If you kill a group of enemies, stick around for about 2 more minutes fighting enemies and the spawn rate at that location will increase like crazy. There's a room in the toy factory that will spawn endless amounts of presents for you to kill repeatedly. I probably did it for a solid 30-45 minutes and it was great!\n-This game also features Arcade mode which is essentially a rogue-like version of the game. It's pretty darn hard but fun I suppose. I haven't played it enough for the purpose of this review though.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing more updates for this game. Not sure if you want to buy it yet? No biggie, PLAY THE DEMO!\nThanks for reading! I will update this review once more updates come out.","August 27, 2015","true","25.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

The combat is fluid, more so than that of Legend of Zelda and equipping a Two-Handed weapon does not take away your ability to use a shield.\n\nThe character sprites are amazing and dynamic, you rarely find an NPC doing nothing physically as most have a nice implemented action to make themselves seem more lifelike. Ones that you find in-game that do this range from flipping their hair, kicking a wagon, turning a crank, and even sipping tea or sneezing. It makes the world come to life more and each NPC has their own individual character portrait to show that they aren't just faceless boring no-name people in the lush world of Grindea.\n\nSkills take another aspect of the game in that they ARE diverse but there isn't a lot of them. Your main weapons will consist of a sword, either one-handed or two-handed and that is the limitation of your weapons. You will find others such as a bow and arrow while exploring but that is just a side weapon which left me wanting a more diverse weapon system. I wish there were more weapons such as a double headed spear that an enemy NPC had or even another skill branch for the bow and arrow but alas there is none.\n\nThe world of Grindea itself is nice and all the sprites are beautiful and amazing, however that does not excuse the games limited exploration. Throughout my playthrough I had tried to explore numerous pathways to other parts of the world only to be stopped by an invisible wall and a text box saying. "You can't go there! That part of the game is not yet implemented." This kills exploration as there is only on path you can take instead of being able to explore the world as you like which leads me wanting more.\n\nFor the price of 14.99$ this game is not bad, and is actually amazing. I just wish that there was more diversity in weapons and one pet peeve of mine is that equipment (such as gloves, shoes, or armor) does not show to change the characters clothes as if appearing invisible. That being said however, this game is not worth 15$ but IS worthy of your time as the world of Grindea is still being made, hopefully once finished it will be worth its expensive price.","January 12","true","2.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Have even more skills that are fun to use.\n\nNow for magic,  though it feels a bit on the weak end, it is still fun, especially the fire skills to me.

Unfortunatly, I have a couple of opinions :/ First of all, I think that pets should be able to help out in fights. Second, I think that Mages are a little OP. Third, there should be SOME form of regen like Health Potions sold at the Alchemy Shop, or some kind of Spell that restores health. Forth, Boars are insanly difficult and frustrating to battle considering they are incredibly fast and deal heavy damage, so you cant easily take them down without heavy damage. It doesn't really help that you have to perfectly time a Quick-Block. Fifth, I found an easy way to exploit the fact that you can cut off the attack recharge by Quick-Blocking. For example, if I were to Attack and Block really quickly alternating, i can attack twice a second and deall about 400 damage per second. I also used a whole lot of differant things that i could label as a little broken. First, Phillip (what I call the adorable little snow monster), I want to know whether or not i shoul consider him broken. I decided to max out Phillip and now hes practically like a second me (^-^)\n\nI'll add more later, but for now, I'd love to see Boar nerfing, and Health Potions in Story Mode.","July 17, 2015","true","10.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

All of the bosses, except for one, have been somewhat challenging. I just hope that the game will progress further and not end up dropped and incomplete. I feel that the game needs a lot more content still. Maybe expanding the crafting system with upgrades and more rewards for farming.\n\nI really don't like purchasing Early Access games but it was good enough that I only regret buying it a little. So if you've got a ton of money to spend, go for it. If you're looking to spend your money a little more wisely, I'd wait a bit for a more complete game.","May 7","true","9.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Forget all those games you get in bundles that claim to be retro greatness, but they are really just posing behind 8 & 16 bit graphics but are missing all the greatness that those eras stood for. Those games try to make you buy their games based on your love for nostalgia. This one hit it on the money!!!!!\n\nSecrets of Grindea!!!! Oh yes, this game has done it all right. This is a game that brings back all the best memories from the classic era, games like Zelda for SNES, Secrets of Mana, and it takes what we loved in those games to a whole new level with modern additions and systems.\n\nThe combat is awesome action RPG goodness. Hack and slash, cast spells, dodge, block, aim, it is all here and feels great, tight and responsive.\n\nThe class system is that you can be anything you want. use any weapon, buy any skill from any school of magic. Boost defense, boost elements, boost crit, boost certain spell types and so on. Insane amount of depth with limitless combination of ways to build your character.\n\nYou can also customize the way you look with different looking hats, shields, weapons that you find and equip throughout the game, its all visible, your hair and skin color and more is also selectable.\n\nSlash bushes, crates, vases, you know we all loved to do that and see what item is inside, could be nothing or something great.\n\nThere is crafting, fishing and all kinds of other "jobs" that you can do in this game as well. It has multiplayer where friends can join you on your adventure online.\n\nThis game has so much greatness and is only in EA. These Devs work hard and love what they are creating and it shows. If you really love retro gaming, you will buy this now!!! Stop buying the low quality crap that comes from greenlight for 10 games in a $1 bundle and put your cash down on something you will actually play, enjoy and be proud to own and say you paid for.","July 25, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It could easily be a year or two before the game's finished, and while there's areas and skills missing, the game itself is open with what's missing. It's one o fthe very few game's I've played where the inspiration (Zelda and Secret of Mana being the obvious ones) does not restrict the game in any way. It's not trying to be those games and the devs clearly have a great vision for the game. I've already put 20 hours in pre-Steam release, so I would say it's reasonable to expect that from the game's current state.","July 31, 2015","true","20.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Quite Stable Early Access too ( Beta ).\n\nCombat is fun but sometimes overwhelming ( bloo** bees.... ), skills are looking great and there is something for everyone!\n\nMy only concern is that even though the game is fun, you will run out of things to do pretty fast... There are only 3 people working on it and it's been months since I saw new area added and years since the game was available on pre-order on Humble Bundle. Buy it if you don't mind incomplete game but what they have is definitely fun. Also there is ARCADE mode which you can play over and over ! It's challenging and will keep you occupied until they release new content for campaign.\n\nAs for Art style it's not for everyone and I personally don't like some of it but that is not going to stop me from enjoying the game. I would like to see my items equiped ( like the shield or armor ) but I understand that this would put too much strain on the animator... oh well.\n\nI do recommend this game if you are into top down view / old school / action RPG's :D\nIt has online multiplayer!

It's still a work-in-progress and there's still a crapload of stuff to do and secrets to find! From farming enemies and bosses to sidequests to finding the pet-items that let you recruit new unlockable pets, there's tons of content in the story mode alone! But if that isn't good enough for you, there's the roguelike arcade mode. I'd compare it mostly to Binding of Isaac, going through randomly generated floors and fighting bosses at the end of each one, unlocking bonuses for your next run. What interests me most, though, is that there are rewards that can be transferred to the story mode as well, such as hats or the INSANELY-DIFFICULT-TO-OBTAIN Fae pet.

And once you've killed enough of the mobs you can then move to the MANY Bosses this game has and there are one of the great aspects of this game, the boss disign is amazing, kinda remids me of a Dark Souls boss disign with how you have to learn the bosses and see how to fight them, some are easier than others but i feel as the game progresses in development they will only get better and better. Another great feature of the game is the skill pages. theres so many skills you can pick from to improve your character. I cant really explain it but as soon as you look at it you'll know what i mean. I could talk about how amazing this game is already and they only have two temples and could make as many as they want.                                                                         Finaly all im going to say is that this game is worth the $15 and in my opinion should cost more beacuse theres just so much to do in this game i cant even explain it all in this review. Just buy it or your missing out on one of the better early access games.","July 19, 2015","true","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I am serious. Usually a game keeps my attention for .4 to 3.5 hours before I move on to another game or switch back to playing CS:GO.\n\n19.4 hours before I am forcing myself to go play a few CS:GO Matches.\n\nThat is insane.\n\nI beat the early access normal Story. Then ran some Arcade, which is so Rouge-Lite it made my heart hurt. I just had to keep going.\n\nOkay, so a bit of a breakdown. The Graphics are what you see. 16 bit love. The game play is a mixture of A Link To The Past, Secret of Mana, and some flair of it's own.\n\nMultiplayer is a bit laggy at times, but other than that it's fun as hell.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough honestly.\n\nThere are bugs, there are balancing issues, and I can accept that because the game is not complete.\n\nBut that being said, I would play this incomplete game over 90% of the complete games avaliable right now.\n\nBuy this.

So now here is the short version...\n\nThis game is already awesome. If the developers keep showing it this much love and add as much content as humanly possible (Weapons, gear, side missions, etc) this could be one of the best top down old school style action RPG's to ever come from an indie developer. Just please make this game as long as possible because it would suck to see such a great game be cut short. It deserves a long campaign, tons of side quests and other things to do because the game is just oozing with potential where it is already.\n\nI have only played for a little while so i will have to add to this once i dive in deeper but i am comfortable recommending this to anyone that is into these types of games now.

The latter has more frequent updates (every few weeks) the former every month or two, from my understanding.\n\nCons:\n-The amount of monsters you have to kill and the many hours it takes to get a drop does not line up with an items rarity most of the time. It is not unheard of to spend 4-8 hours killing the same monster all to get a drop that is probably not better than what you already have JUST so you can work towards 100% completion. This is never a requirement, but the cards you can get in particular offer small permanent bonuses, and it can take you anywhere from 30 minutes to 8 hours to find the one that you want.\n-It's short. But the game's not done yet. The current story can be done in about 4-6 hours. Getting collectibles could get you another 10-20 hours, depending on your luck. Question is, do you want those mostly mediocre drops bad enough to spend all that time?\n-Arcade mode as a single player is quite a challenge. I usually opt for the harder options in video games like Kingdom Hearts on Critical but this mode is hard from the get go if you are alone. I would like to see some scaling in difficulty to make it more doable (maybe there already is, and I just suck.) But if you're looking for a challenge, you've got it here. An option to turn down the difficulty would be nice though.\n\nThese problems can be easily remedied with time, however. The creators are friendly and interactive with their community, and they post frequent updates.\nSo the question is, do I recommend this game? Is it worth the current price of $15.00?\nYes it is. For the amount of playtime I got out of it, for the potential of what it can become, and for the multiplayer, which I didn't even touch, which is sure to add many hours. If nothing else, follow this game. Come back to it later. For an avid RPG fan, this is a game to watch out for.","August 27, 2015","true","14.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But at the same time, there is a blatant lack of content for now :\nA handful of quest (a small dozen), three temples, five potential pets, around thirty different enemies, quite few crafting possibilities, etc. While it's quite decent, you just finish the current storyline with the feeling you need much more, and the world is really cramped.\nThat's the only actual flaw I can find in Secrets of Grindea : it needs to be expanded.

I think this was two years ago? At the time the game only had about an hour of gameplay if you 100% everything. Being a person that understands what early-access is I decided to give the game a while before coming back and trying it again.\n\nNow the game has evolved quite a bit since I last played. They have added on a few features, and the story is far more progressed... and it's awesome. The combat is fun, the dungeons are very well scripted and planned out, and the bosses are exciting and challenging. I'm happy to say the multiplayer is also very well done. I have spent a few hours playing with my wife with little to no issues (One time she couldn't see a boss for some reason)\n\nOne of the neat aspects about Grindea is actually the way grinding works. If you stay in one place and kill things for a bit you will see that enemies will begin to spawn more and more frequently. This allows for quick leveling and farming for items. It also means that grinding gets more challenging in that spot. It is well worth it for more than just leveling, enemies can also drop special cards that give your character permanent stat boosts.\n\nI could go on but I think one would really have to play the game to get a good impression. Luckily they have a demo although I don't know how up to date it is compared to the actual game.","July 27, 2015","true","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is played from a top-down perspective and combat is done in real-time, comparable to Secret of Mana and 2D Legend of Zelda games. If you like the combat in those games you'll probably enjoy Secrets of Grindea.\n\nThe skill and customization options in the game are very unique in how much freedom the game gives you as a player. The game gives you several options as far as play styles, but you can mix and match the skills as you desire and create a unique playstyle and skill set for yourself. You're also given 2 cosmetic item slots for your characters to customize your hat and/or face accessory so that you can look good, but keep the stats of much better items instead.\n\nThe Pixel art is great, everything looks vibrant and is very reminiscent of the SNES era, but at the same time has a very modern feel. The Music is fits well, and is exactly what you'd expect from most RPGs. The humor and references are great, if you've played a lot of RPGs, you'll really appreciate the games' dialogue and subtle nods to other franchises.\n\nThe Arcade mode adds great replayability to the game by adding a roguelike element in randomly generated areas and starting from the beginning if you die, great for those looking for a challenge and wanting more of the game.\n\nDid I mention the game supports (Online) Multiplayer? It does, this game can be even more fun with friends! You can go through the Story Mode or Arcade together and this only adds to the game's merits. Local Co-Op is currently unsupported unfortunately.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the game is in early access and incomplete and Story Mode is a bit short, but I strongly suggest trying out the demo and trying the game for yourself. If you like it, you'll probably enjoy what the full game offers now and in the future.","July 23, 2015","true","13.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Solid music, good combat, and some pretty good humor make this a great time, and really makes me eager for future updates. There really isnt much to complain about here, but there are a few nitpicks. I noticed a few typos, picking up health orbs is a little annoying (as you need to stand right on top of them to collect them), some of the bosses need a bit of tweaking, and some of the characters artwork could be touched up a bit, maybe smoothed out a bit and varying the facial features, as many characters look similar. None of those nitpicks really take away from what you get here though, a fantastic look into what I hope will be an amazing finished product.

I don't really know where to start with this game, other than that it's good. Granted, it's still Beta, and therefor unfinished, I would say this game is close to a Dark Souls level of Difficulty vs Reward, and for the most part, the combat is pretty well done (although it can be a tad frustrating at points.) My only real gripe about this game is that there isn't native controller support (again, still beta...) however with some modifcation to my DS3 Tool, I was able to play this with a controller to which I strongly suggest people trying it this way if Keyboard/Mouse isn't really your style. All things considered with what's already in the game, it's pretty fun, and you'll get pretty significant playtime out of it for your money. Oh, and the character dialogue is actually pretty good. I genuinely laughed and giggled at a lot of the things the characters said, and the way they interacted.\n\nTL:DR - If you're already interested enough to read reviews, just buy it, I doubt you'll be disappointed.","September 11, 2015","true","14.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Ever make any review posts, heck may be first one on Steam spite I been using Steam for so long.  But this game, the potential, wow, I cant wait to see the finished product, and I hope more and more will be added once the product is finished.  This game reminds me of the days I spent playing Secret of Mana with my best friend from childhood, and we beaten that game six times over and still didnt get tired of it.\n\nEverything is superb, music, animation, but what gets me is the potential for massive grind, character customization and the collection of items.  I hope by 1.0 the game will have more weapon types, ranged, and at least double the skills magic and abilities to choose from.  Plays really friggen well on my Razer Sabertooth.

As the name suggests, grinding is important because you can gain special items by mass killing certain enemies. The game is short at the moment, but if you take your time and complete everything it has roughly 8 hours of gameplay if you play with 2 other friends.\n\nThere are commands in-game that allow you to play around and figure out what tree you want to follow, but I will not give you the commands because it kinda ruins the game. Either way, using commands will not make you a god, and it will not make the game easy.

I played it for a couple days but I was so hooked I just couldn't let go of the controller, it's really excellent ! But at the same time, there is a blatant lack of content for now :\nA handful of quest (a small dozen), three temples, five potential pets, around thirty different enemies, quite few crafting possibilities, etc. While it's quite decent, you just finish the current storyline with the feeling you need much more, and the world is really cramped.\nThat's the only actual flaw I can find in Secrets of Grindea : it needs to be expanded. I literally finished all the content, including crafting and grinding most components, in a few hours. I must admit however that the arcade mode is really fun and can increase the time you spend playing significantly !","July 24, 2015","true","13.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its as many people have said about it early access however the devs been working on this game for 4 years from what people are saying in the forums and it shows through the quality of the game.\n\nStory mode from what I gather is still lacking about 6 hours in total however it only intends to get better :) and longer as they add more stuff in. as the development progresses I can only see the game getting better.\n\nArcade mode satisfies my rogue dungeon crawling needs as you have 1 life to get through as far as you can get which is a good time killer if no time for story mode.\n\nOverall the game is very polished and I am glad to play this game as early as I did hope it gets only better :), because this game shows that the dev is very knowledgeable and very concern with quality.","July 26, 2015","true","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It brings back the feel of classic games like The Legend of Zelda, but with the added bonus of your friends tagging along. The story is fun, light, and there are many classic throwbacks that gamers will smile at as they play. Definitely worth investing in to help progress it to completion.\n\nSome more good things; there are a lot of reasons to continually fight spawning monsters, which makes farming experience worth it. From collecting new items, which help to craft better armor and weapons, to making the money, to just gathering xp to expand your skills. (Which there are many of.)\n\nThe only downside I and my friend have found, is the magic abilities aren't as useful as the melee abilities.

This, along with the art style, and music this really makes it a lovely world. And even on the normal difficulty, the game gets quite challenging ( note. i only played singleplayer so far ). It's very nice to see that every single NPC has their own visual and character portrait.\n\nThis game also has an arcade mode, which slowly let's you become stronger in the long run. it has randomised "dungeons" that you can do, and it's really fun and challenging. i do reccommend this only after playing quite a bit of story because it's pretty difficult and may contain spoilers.\n\nMy computer doesn't run the smoothest at times, but today it's searing hot outside, my home is boiling and the game is still running fine no problem. so that is not a problem at all.\n\ni really reccomend this game if you're into RPG's, or if you're into roguelikes like binding of isaac.","July 16, 2015","true","11.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Think Zelda's a Link to the Past, or Secret of Mana, but with infinate inventory, craftable equipment, and a slew of spells, including summons. There's tons of humor, too. The best part is, although it's a few hours of play just for the main story, it's beta, so there's more to come!

The unique Physical/Magic hybrid doesnt really have a niche because you have to min/max your atk/spell power if you want to actually kill some of the bosses since there is no healing during.\n\nIn my opinion, the combat is unique and challenging but sometimes 'clunky'. overrall a great game but at this rate I'd wager it will take a couple years for it to be fully released\n\nAs is, if you have a few friends who all want to buy it and play the available content start to finish, you might get 10 hours out of it if you're really intricate.","May 24","false","25.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's got 2 modes: story and arcade, both can be played solo or multiplayer. Story is a world with waypoints, quests, and little punishment for death in normal mode. Arcade is similar to Binding of Isaac with rooms that lock you in with enemies you must kill.\n\nReally well done game with some quality content, good mechanics, and great multiplayer. It's simply a lot of fun and also challenging. Did have some issues with infrequent disconnects and crashes, but players can join an existing session so it's not too troublesome.\n\nThere's a lot of potential here, but the story mode is just too short right now. The game's really nice for early access, and as is would be worth $5-10. You can finish the current incomplete story mode in about 5 hours or less.

Figured I'd give my input.\n\nFor $14.99, it was fun while it lasted, but waaay too short as you could reach the final area before you're stopped by an NPC that tells you you've reached the end of the Beta.\n\nSo far I'm Lvl 20, and though I did most the side quests (only have like 3 left), there isn't much else to do other than grind and collect stuff, which is repetitive and tedious. Then again, that's what you gotta expect from a game called Secrets of Grindea, and playing the role of a "Collector" as they are called in this game.\n\nNot saying it's a bad game, it was fun, and it's more fun and challenging if you have friends to play with, but aside from that, it seems fairly short for its current price, as the game is incomplete, and you have to wait for more of the story to be released to be able to continue.\n\nBecause of this, I can not recommend this game, because I've seen games before that are early access, or incomplete, with a fairly moderate to high price, only to eventually not be completed at all, leaving us loyal consumers in the dust, and kicking ourselves for spending $14.99 on an incomplete game that may or may not be completed in the near future.\n\nI'll continue to play it, just so I can get all the cards, and farm some items while I wait. But until then, I wouldn't recommend this game until it is fully released, and when it is, I may change my recommendation then.","April 16","false","21.3"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","2"

Pretty annoying if you ask me.\nMy third and final issue that I found was that half the time while trying to run the game, instead of loading it up straight away like my other games, it wouldn't start up. So after clicking on the desktop icon a couple times, it finally loaded up but not properly. The game's resolution screwed up my screen size and zoomed in on a portion of my desktop in a lower quality without the game even loadind up fully. The taskbar icon for the game was active but the game itself wasn't running at all. It didn't even come up when I loaded task manager and tried to end task it. Manually closing it from the taskbar didn't help either. I tried to get a refund, but of course you can only get a refund for a game if you have UNDER 2 HOURS. Pretty dissapointed because not only could I have spent my hard earned cash on something else that would actually work, but I can't even get my money back.\nOverall, gameplay and fighting is kinda generic and well put together, but the amount of bugs in only 2 and a half hours is pretty horrendous.\n4/10\n\nP.S.

Above average story, fun, engaging script, and likable character tropes.  The visual style lends itself well to all aspects of the game.\n\nHowever, this is a game where combat is the bulk of play; in its current state combat is just a little too clunky for my liking to give this game a solid recommendation.  That being said, much of player control is surprisingly tight and responsive.  The problem is that there are too many zerg-rush rooms to let skillful control shine.  Anemic character reach is punctuated by punishing post-swing recovery, and the mobs of enemies ensure that, whether you hit your target or not, another enemy will likely be shooting you in the back during your recovery frames.  Shield-block input seems sluggish deciding between whether you told the character to strafe with the shield up or to change direction to block the sword about to slash your back open.  Perfect Guarding is just an absolute mess when 4+ enemies are wailing on you.\n\nI'm hopeful this will end up a gem of a game, but right now stay away unless you're interested in playtesting to contribute to its growth.","April 1","false","41.2"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","2"

I bought 3 copies of this for myself and 2 friends... and let me tell you.  That was a dissapointment.  This game MIGHT end up a gem, but for now?  This gem needs a roll in the rock tumbler.  PS.  Fix your combat skills.  As smooth as the movement is, the skills feel like you have to touch the enemy to land half of them.  Also: in multiplayer health orbs not only are actually hard to pickup due to the 1 mm hit detection, but they arent shared with the team.  thumbs up on boss fights though.  for instance, in the first dungeon I really enjoy how you presented them.  even if your gear is such dogsh*t that if you get hit a few times you get dropped.  button mashing won them... not skill placement","March 26","false","9.1"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

So many great skills, items, quests. The artwork was great, the game was wonderful. But this isn't Early Access. The game is just plain unfinished.

So much potential, and it's still on the works, and it has been so for a while (not apparent from the Steam release date, but the project has been going on before that for a couple of years).

Its not done and some parts of the game feel a bit out of place with the crafting system being hard to come by or just boring grinding. Boss fights are amazing and one of the best parts of the game but is one of the only good parts to look foward to in this game.\n\nThe leveling up system feels out of place and I know that the devs wanted a game where you can do anything you want with no class or items that truly make you different with others but honeslty that what makes a good RPG or even games with simular things like WoW, Fallout, Skyrim and etc, hell even Terraria does it well. So many times me and my friends found items that were just better that what we had already so having no other choice we use it hoping maybe it will help us. With No Classes thier no reason to build up to a certain classes or benifits really because at times it seems like your character is no different then the other people who play this because everyone justs goes for something thats good and only the good moves and perks making it kinda pointless when just everyone gets the same ♥♥♥♥, taking the varity out of the game and really nothing to say" I made this character to my play style or even a cool build".\n\nMoney is also Pointless at times and just used to buy junk at the blacksmith because you dont wanna grind or dont even know about the bad crafting system in the game. The crafting system is never really introduce and its just there at times not really showing you anything about it or some of the cool items you can make. Two choices that best describe the crafting system is thats it there use it or don't because you will probly forget about it or don't care.\n\nStory is good, fun and amazing but at times its like left 4 dead, by just walking from point A to point B making it really boring along with the never ending spawning of enemies that just are annoying as hell at times.\n\nThis game brings alot of cool elements and amazing coop gameplay that just make it feel right. I truly want to play this game more but theres nothing atm ( AND THE GAMES NOT DONE ) that makes me want to come back with buddies and play. Its a great adventure but with mechanics that don't feel right but is not afriad to try something new but Im just not sure if it fits the game while this game trys to be more than one genre and even then it hardly fits them. Its a decent game and I see alot of potenial in this and wish that other games took risk with like this at times.","September 26, 2015","false","14.8"," 5 of 44 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","5","44","0","1"

I really like its pixellated art style and its level system! Its level system is especially great because of its distribution of normal and gold skill points, basically to level skills (which I may add arent limited to a certain class you can choose any skill or spell regardless!) you need to get skill points but eventually once the skill is a high enough level normal skill points wont work and you need to use golden points to make the skill stronger these golden skill points are much more infrequent than normal skill points this provides a way of making it so that you dont get super strong super fast giving you a much more challenging aspect. Another great aspect of the grame is its great side activities! You can fish, tame pets do fun sidequests, herd chickens, and craft strong weapons and armor! I love the crafting system its simple but still needs a fair amount of grinding for certain items, which is great because its well IN THE NAME and it gives you great satisfaction when you finally craft the item! One of the only complaints I'd have about the game is it only lets you play with steam friends which is ok i geuss but I'd like to be able to play with people online I could make new friends with, not neccesarily for story mode but more for arcade mode, which i may add is a little cruel. Other than what i have already stated I have no complaints I really look forward too the games further development in which something I hope to see is a skill line for the bow and different kinds of bows like there are swords, another thing I REALLY HOPE TO SEEEE is healing! while I understand enemies drop health from time to time I feel health potions would be very useful and would bring more attention to the potions shop in Evergrind, another thing regarding healing I hope to see in the game is a healing skill for the support skill line I personally would really like this because healing teamate would make the game a lot more fun with friends.

I cannot wait for more of the game to unlock so I can proceed further.\n\nBeing an avid NES/SNES player, this game has an element of Zelda (Link's Awakening) into it that I greatly enjoyed. Smooth gameplay, at times frustrating when you aim the wrong way, or the enemy misses your shield but strikes you. Otherwise, I cannot put this game down.\n\nA great RPG element, with tons of skill customization. You want to be a sword wielding mage? JUST DO IT! You want to be a barbarian focusing on pure damage? DO IT! You want to be Knight with a mixture of AOE spells? DO IT! Like I said, you pick what sort of character you want to be.\n\nA def worthy buy.","December 13, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It implements features like skills that you can upgrade, which allows you to choose what role your character takes (Melee or magic, or both). The devs seemed to focus more on mechanics and gameplay rather than storyline. But, it's not all hack-and-slash, there are puzzles through out the game, some that you have to complete, some not. The combat is good in-that you can't just spam the attact button since that'll probably get you hit, the game kind of forces you to utilise skills that you've chosen when in combat, which is a good thing because it keeps the player on their toes and makes them think about what their next move will be. Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone who likes these sort of games and not just games like CoD and CS:GO and even though the game's in beta, it feels like a completed game.","December 22, 2015","true","81.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also brings a lot more creation to you for your character, allowing you to customise your appearance and choose the way you level your abilities/skills (one of the main reasons I love RPGs). Not to mention that you can play with 3 other people, who make their own unique characters too. My brother and I bought this game yesterday and have had a blast playing it together, which was quite helpful as some of the boss fights would be a real pain by myself; farming for crafting materials too.\n\nOf coarse it is still in the beta and there are a few paths that are blocked off as the next map has literally not been added to the game yet, but my concern at this point, is worry for how big this game will be; My brother and I haven't played that long (though it has been a few hours) and it appears that we are about halfway through the story. You can have up to nine characters, but there isn't a whole lot you can do different between plays (you can make it more difficault and play alone for a real challenge or try a different build for your character) and I fear I may get board once I've finished the game once or twice, but thats just me; others might like shorter games.\n\nHaving said that, I have no idea what the creators plan and what plot twist there could be, which could have this game spiralling much deeper and longer than it appears; my hope is for a game at least as long as the games I mentioned above. It is in beta after all, and so far I love this game.\n\n","January 25","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also random spec'd weapons in that dungeon [recoloured weapons an items if developer gets lazy but need stronger weapons for /beastmode on]. Arcade mode is a blast and the story is fun. The art work for the NPCs is alittle dodgy but it adds to the games flavor. Its just after you get as far as the story will let you, arcade is the only replaiblity after you collect everything. Great so far and has a sh*t ton of potential and i can see it going far. One thing i have been talking to my friends about is a trade system and a strafing when attacking. I just really want an Endless randomizing dungeon you can access in the story mode characters. for now i'ma just farm the gifts and presents with /beastmode on.\n\nLast note, possible steam workshop for this game? allow modders to add mode balanced weapons and equips. possibly maps and dungeon out side of arcade mode.\n\nEdit. some hit boxes are off as well","February 1","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/D22/recommended/269770/","D22","Moobs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/D22/","478 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPERMANENT BETA\nPERMANENT BETA\nYesterday Planetary Annihilation released a standalone game that completely replaces their older product. The game was successfully Kickstarted and went through Early Access where it attracted endless negative reviews; missing features, promises that weren't kept and deadlines that weren't met. The cynical among us might suggest a completely new product means a fresh slate for Steam reviews - but it's a damning indictment of a company's misuse of Early Access.\n\nIt's a shame because, for the most part, Early Access has been a phenomenon, allowing games to grow and developers to get real feedback on what's working and what isn't and make changes based on those player responses. Secrets of Grindea has recently hit the Early Access scene and, after a successful demo launch earlier in the year, stands out as a shining example of development done right.\n\nSecrets of Grindea is a 2D RPG in the vein of the older Zelda or 'Of Mana' titles. it has the same charming art style but has a quality of animation that gives the whole game a modern feel, that unfortunately doesn't translate especially well into screenshots. The game focuses on a young boy leaving his village to become a man (stop me if you've heard this one before) and to do so he must first collect his sword and shield and make his way to the nearest town.\n\nOn the way you'll learn the basics of combat and get a real feel for how exceptionally well animated Secrets of Grindea is. The sway of a cloak as you dash, the hunched shoulders of a defensive position and the theatrical swirl as human enemies pirouette to the ground in defeat.\n\nThe premise of the game is, aside from killing and leveling up, that you are a collector. A type of champion who's tasked with chronicling and cataloging things within Grindea's gorgeous and vibrant world. There's a hint of Pokemon about it all, but Secrets of Grindea wears its influences proudly; and why not? This is an excellent reimagining of some classic ideas and franchises.\n\nThe levelling up system itself is more reminiscent of Diablo than any other franchise. As you level up you get skill points which you can put into various areas; magic, defense, skills etc You can unlock new, castable abilities which subsequent points will improve, or level up several of your passive skills. It's adequate, though I'm yet to come across a level up system that I could ever describe as anything other.\n\nI've finished all the content available in Secrets of Grindea's Early Access build outside of the game's Arcade Mode which I'll delve into when the full release arrives. As it stands, though, I would have no reservations about recommending Secrets of Grindea to anyone. It's been a while since a game has been so whimsical, light-hearted and, as simple as it sounds, fun. It's gorgeous, colourful with a stellar soundtrack and is more than an homage to 16 bit classics. This is a faithful re-imagining of the tropes of old with a modern shine and it does it so much better than everyone else.\n\nhttp://www.permanent-beta.net/previews/2015/8/19/early-access-investigations-secrets-of-grindea","August 19, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finding new pets seemed neat at first until we realized they all start at the same stats, so changing pets just sets you backwards.\n- Love the hats and the masks, wish you could see the different shoes on your character.\n- Fun story :)\n- The open skill system with added effects at later levels.\n- Love the music, very nostalgic.\n- The card collecting adding stats was a GREAT way to make a seeminly simple mechanic actually worth using.\n\nCons:\n\n- Some of the boss battles feel cheap, the hydra comes to mind as they will wait to attack the only time you have to attack the one that's on the ground, so you just end up running around in circles with your thumb up your rear.\n- Some boss fights have attack timings that rely more on lucky character placement as you can't react fast enough to block it or avoid it. They are still fun, but we def. ended up fighting Winter like 5 times :p.\n-\n\n- More recipes, more gear, more skills, just need more content.\n\nOverall, both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed what this game had to offer so far, and were glad to support the developers and look forward to future updates.\n\nP.S.

Absolutely recomended to people who love old school jrpgs especially secret of mana.  While i still feel the graphics of secret of mana are superior  (grindeas are gorgeous though) grindeda  actually lets you cast spells without pausing the game and offers online multiplayer which is great.  Since the game is early access and not everythings done yet you may be thinking ill wait for them to iron out the bugs.  While the whole game isn't available yet bug free thankfully they have given us the option to play stable or frontline. stable is obviously bug free and frontline lets you go farther but with bugs so you can play how you choose your style.","October 3, 2015","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, the Secrets of Grindea is basically that, but better. SOG as I call it, starts as you as the silent protagonist in the world of Grindea, a fantasy world with a main story, and a bunch of side quests. This game is yet another early access game, but there is a ton to do here, just in the Beta version. There are 2 main modes so far. There's the main story campain, that you can eather play alone or with friends   online on a co op game. And there's Arcade Mode where you and friends can go through dungeons, collect treasure, weapons, do challenges, and kill enemies, to see how far you get. If you die you start over, so you have to do it all again, but  you can get escence statues, that you can use to purchase upgrades, to give you an easier time. Honestly, I think it's annoying sometimes, starting all over each time, but it's still fun regardless.\n\nSOG is a very good game, and I absolutely love it, even in Beta, and I can't wait to see what the full game will be like! It's fun with friends, and great alone.  For $15 I still think it's worth the price, and I usually don't think that for other early access games.\n\nThe Secrets of Grindea gets a 9.5/10","February 10","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like a cross between Ys and Zelda. Very good gameplay 10/10. The combat mechanics are very well thought out, many enemies cooperate and you have to plan your attacks accordingly. Bosses will make your heart race, some of them reminds a bit of bullet hell shooters. Animations are very nicely done, music is good. Story seems pretty standard for this kind of game so far, not exactly Chrono Trigger level, but its engaging enough to want to know what happens next and theres lots of funny moments. Theres a simple fishing minigame, mainly for providing food to your pets, who gives different permanent buffs depending on what you feed them, and some not so hard puzzles.\n\nI dunno how much of the game (story mode) is finished atm, mabye 1/4? (hope its less :p ) The content that is in the game seems 100% done and everything is working great, very polished, unlike most early access games... Didnt notice any bugs. As of now theres about 10-12 hours worth of the main game (mabye a bit less if you play on normal and just blaze through) + xx hours of arcade mode, wich is a sort of semi random series of "rooms" where you try to get as far as possible before you die while building up your character on the way, and get your high score in the global ranking, great fun. Havent tried it in co-op mode yet so cant comment on that.\n\nI can confidently recomend this to anyone, any age, who likes this sort of game. Its a good challenge on hard. Again, the combat gameplay is great, you have to time it right and use the shield, reflect projectiles and know when to go all out and when to hold back. Truly a gem in the making.\n\n","October 22, 2015","true","52.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Aside from being an awesome modern Rpg, this game has quailty origianl sound effects and music that allows it to be its own classic. With similar sounds of other popular video games influences, i can tell the sound design team did a great job in creating these samples. From catching fish to your melee abilities, everything has its own sound that truly belongs. When you complete an quest or get an achievement, the sound and music reflect that.\n\nThe music is composed very well, hats of to the composer(s)!\n\nIt truly makes you feel like your apart of the world of Grindea. Good job composer(s) and sfx team for creating wonderful ear candy for all the items,quests and locations.\nCheers\n\n- Airship Enoch\nwww.AirshipEnoch.com","February 13","true","29.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game reminds me of the SNES type action-RPG's that I loved growing up. While the game is still in development, I can't wait to see how it shapes up. For anyone who is thinking of buying this, it is important to note that there are two servers. The first is the stable server that you get access to with initial purchase. This is the one I started playing on before I realized there was another server: Frontline. Which is the beta server and has the latest updates and much more content.\n\nSo far this game is exactly what I've been looking for in a "retro" style game. Currently 5/5.

The combat is very good, fluid and doesn't make you "get caught in animation" with that said, you can miss attacks if not facing the same way as the enemy. This can make things a bit difficult in tight spots, however the blocking system works really well.\n\nAll in all this game is great, you wont regret buying it, full price or on sale (which I have yet to see it do) however I have one caution for any buyer....\n\n****DO NOT BUY THIS ON STEAM!********You're missing out on a free DRM free copy!! Thats right, if you buy this here you don't have access to the DRM free copy, but if you buy it through either Secrets of Grindea's website, or on Humble Bundle's site they give you access to both the Steam key and a DRM free copy! So DO NOT BUY HERE!

I really like its pixellated art style and its level system! Its level system is especially great because of its distribution of normal and gold skill points, basically to level skills (which I may add arent limited to a certain class you can choose any skill or spell regardless!) you need to get skill points but eventually once the skill is a high enough level normal skill points wont work and you need to use golden points to make the skill stronger these golden skill points are much more infrequent than normal skill points this provides a way of making it so that you dont get super strong super fast giving you a much more challenging aspect. Another great aspect of the grame is its great side activities! You can fish, tame pets do fun sidequests, herd chickens, and craft strong weapons and armor! I love the crafting system its simple but still needs a fair amount of grinding for certain items, which is great because its well IN THE NAME and it gives you great satisfaction when you finally craft the item! One of the only complaints I'd have about the game is it only lets you play with steam friends which is ok i geuss but I'd like to be able to play with people online I could make new friends with, not neccesarily for story mode but more for arcade mode, which i may add is a little cruel. Other than what i have already stated I have no complaints I really look forward too the games further development in which something I hope to see is a skill line for the bow and different kinds of bows like there are swords, another thing I REALLY HOPE TO SEEEE is healing! while I understand enemies drop health from time to time I feel health potions would be very useful and would bring more attention to the potions shop in Evergrind, another thing regarding healing I hope to see in the game is a healing skill for the support skill line I personally would really like this because healing teamate would make the game a lot more fun with friends.

Monsters/enemies are well-made. Good aesthetics, not too easy and not too difficult.\nThere's plenty of secrets and tricks to discover as well.\nThe crafting system is actually pretty decent, it's quite easy to figure out, though there's no information saying "item dropped by X" - You kinda have to remember which enemy drops what, but the names are quite relatable!\n\nI've played it solo as well and can be fun, but I think with good company it's more enjoyable, although you'll have to fight for loot haha! (loot settings can be altered by host)\nI'd recommend this game if you like exploring and crafting.\n\nNot to mention the art style is incredibly cute :) (reminds me of Maple Story)","October 6, 2015","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Talk about a refreshing one! Lately, I've been having a hankering for some nostalgia, but at the same time I really didn't want to play something I've already played before. This game was able to satisfy both of those aspects for me. While it is still in beta, this game actually really stands up for itself! Customizeable characters (hair style, hair color, skin color, scarf color, shirt color, and pants color), hack and slash, level up system, upgradeable skills, crafting, clever dialogue, addicting gameplay, and difficult bosses keep you addicted as you realize you've lost a few hours of your life.

You can't just hack and slash your way through dungeons. You have to think about your foes weaknesses and your strengths and play on that. The boss fights themselves can sometimes be considered a puzzle.\n\n\nOverall the storyline is fairly average(and at this moment incomplete), but the creators have put a lot of effort in making sure the dialogue is complete and and have even slipped in some comedy to give you a laugh every once in awhile.\n\nGood game overall with lots of potential, can’t wait to see what comes next!","February 14","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is very satisfying, especially with controller, I havent tried with mouse and keyboard, but with controller everything is smooth and awesome. The bossbattles are extremely wild and incredibly satisfying when you win, the battles are quite hard on normal difficulity, and when you die you dont really feel cheated or that anything is unfair, you just kinda laugh and get back at it. The graphics are a perfect 10/10 for the type of game it wants to be. beautiful particle effects, and animations. Some of the characters you meet are quite memorable, because of their attitude, or just humour.\n\nIf you want something to play by yourself or with up to 4 friends , thats smooth, fun, challanging, and awesome, then this is the perfect game, and its not that expensive. I really reccommend this game even tho on the screenshots and video it might not look that extraordinary, but trust me, its fantastic. 9.5/10 from me.","October 23, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The animations are smooth, the storyline is enticing, and the combat, surprisingly, is quite interactive.\n\nThe ability to pick and choose whichever skills you want with no restrictions really allows you to create your OWN character. There is no "optimal" skill set, you just find the one that works for you. The game is extremley challenging on HARD mode, requiring players to strategize on every single fight; giving you a great feeling of satisfaction after clearing a room. Speaking of feelings, the gameplay intertwined with the storyline does an outstanding job at provoking feeling within you. Satisfaction, anger, happiness, confidence, sorrow; it's all there. Of course the game isn't complete, but I am sure that upoin completion the game will take players on an emotional rollercoaster, which will leave you saying "damn, that was a great game"\n\nThe developers constantly update their blog, so that players aren't waiting for new on new content for extended periods of time. They've even bothered to include special dialouge which will let you know when you have reach the end of the stable/ frontline beta (for the time being). And, of course, there are plenty of witty comments that you can sense took time and effort from the team.\n\nPros: Everything\nCons: Not complete yet\n\nI'd have to say, aside from some very slight bugs (which I am sure they will fix) this game deserves a 10/10.\n\nIf you're looking for a game with classic graphics and modern mechanics, this is the game for you. Buy it. You will NOT regret it.\n\n","October 17, 2015","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finding new pets seemed neat at first until we realized they all start at the same stats, so changing pets just sets you backwards.\n- Love the hats and the masks, wish you could see the different shoes on your character.\n- Fun story :)\n- The open skill system with added effects at later levels.\n- Love the music, very nostalgic.\n- The card collecting adding stats was a GREAT way to make a seeminly simple mechanic actually worth using.\n\nCons:\n\n- Some of the boss battles feel cheap, the hydra comes to mind as they will wait to attack the only time you have to attack the one that's on the ground, so you just end up running around in circles with your thumb up your rear.\n- Some boss fights have attack timings that rely more on lucky character placement as you can't react fast enough to block it or avoid it. They are still fun, but we def. ended up fighting Winter like 5 times :p.\n-\n\n- More recipes, more gear, more skills, just need more content.\n\nOverall, both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed what this game had to offer so far, and were glad to support the developers and look forward to future updates.\n\nP.S.

It implements features like skills that you can upgrade, which allows you to choose what role your character takes (Melee or magic, or both).

It has everything I want in an old school RPG.  My main problem with it is that it borrows a lot from Secret of Mana, Zelda, Secret of Evermore, etc.  There is some original content, but even the music is similar.  If more of the game was original it would be perfect.  Other than that and a few glitches that pop up here and there, it is a great game and worth investing in if you miss playing games like FF2 SNES, Secret of Mana, etc.","January 2","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Aside from that, it's a very fun game to grind whether you just wanna spam adventure mode or beat the game.","October 7, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DParse/recommended/269770/","DParse","DParse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DParse/","209 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is excellent but suffers some problems.\n\nSecrets of Grindea is a Zelda style action RPG with levelling.\n\nEdit: Originally I had a paragraph here stating that the game is way too hard, but then I learned that I set the game to "hard" when I started - so to complain about that would be dumb :P. The next paragraph still stands though, regarding some of the hard parts of the game.\n\nI think this could be remedied with a pretty simple fix - another branch of magic that lets you heal/buff. The game has no health potions, so you're at the mercy of health drops from enemies.\n\nAlso, it suffers from a lack of content. This isn't a hard negative - it's still in early access! From the looks of things, the developers have a ton of content planned. As far as I've gotten though, there are very few side quests or optional dungeons, and not a lot of equipment variety.\n\nProbably the most disappointing thing is that, after I started a multiplayer playthrough with my friend, we don't both get Monster Cards together. Loot in general is shared evenly (in Round-Robin sharing) but monster cards take so long to get that it is very very disheartening to not get one when it drops and your friend gets it.\n\nMy last negative point  - the soundtrack is only mediocre. Lots of games these days have phenomenal soundtracks, so you almost expect it when a game hits "Overwhelmingly Positive". I think this game can get there - but the soundtrack isn't helping. It's not bad, but it's not good enough.\n\nBut the positives. Oh man, I could go on and on. So I will.\n\nThe first thing is the graphics - it's BEAUTIFUL. Some of the best pixel art I've seen in years.  Your avatar can be customized with a ton of different styles and colors, and they all look great. Every enemy and character is gorgeously animated . The environment is amazing. This game is just overflowing with great visuals.\n\nThe gameplay is a TON of fun. Combat is great with a few snags in my opinion. The skill system lets you pick whatever skills you want first, with 4 different magic elements and physical skills to choose from. There's a good amount of variety in builds and if you have (quite a lot of) money you can respec all your skills. You can stagger enemies and get bonuses from precise shield blocking. Sometimes if you attack too quickly, it eats your input and you just stand there, so that can be pretty annoying.\n\nYou have a bottomless bag (No inventory management! 5 Stars right there). Enemies drop stuff ALL THE TIME and its really satisfying to collect it all. And there's a ton of stuff to collect. It's a grind-lovers dream. You can refight bosses to get their rare drops.  Every enemy in the game has an ULTRA-RARE drop as well, which can be fun to farm for.\n\nThere's a crafting system that lets you build new equipment with all the drops you collect. IMO the game needs more mage equipment - I still only have 1 wand, from the beginning of the game.\n\nThere are so many well-done mechanics in this game - collecting things is a blast, refighting bosses is excellent, there is a challenge arena, good variety of enemies. It's a ton of fun to play and I can't wait for the full version to come out.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes RPGs or the Legend Of Zelda series.","January 20","true","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
