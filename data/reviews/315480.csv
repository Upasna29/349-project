The latter is a game about prison life while the first one is a tough platformer. Is it as brilliant as, say, Super Meat Boy or the Mario games, though  ? Read on and let’s find out.\n\nThere doesn’t seem to be much of a story here but the goal is to escape with as much loots as you can, hence the title. Sometimes you can take your time, other times you have to be a bit quicker.\nMaking the comparison to Super Mario isn’t entirely fair, because in no way is this a true side-scrolling platformer. As a matter of fact, The Escapist can best be compared to Sonic. So Sonic meets Super Meat Boy. Sounds promising, doesn’t it ? Well… no.\nThe game fails to properly incorporate all of the elements that made these games great in the first place. Meat Boy had excellent level designs and tight controls and Sonic ran at high-speeds, but also still had some excellent controls for a game back then. So yeah, it all comes back to controls.\nYour character can run pretty fast and by clicking your mouse can bounce/roll (Sonic reference here) into a direction of your choice. So the best way to get to the top when you’re standing between two walls is to just use the mouse and bounce your way up. Arrows will appear when you hold the mouse button so that you know which way you’ll go. Unfortunately, the controls are very unreliable and imprecise. There have been tens of times that I knew exactly how to complete a level but the game failed to do what I had in mind; the character continued to run at high speeds, flew off into a different direction or simply didn’t respond to my mouse click. Selecting a path for bouncing also takes too long, and that’s not a good sign for a game that also partially focuses on speed.\nThe fact that you only have one life didn’t help either. This game would’ve been much, much better if it used a health system. I know the goal of the developers is to create a hardcore platformer here, but it just doesn’t work for this game. Especially in levels that scroll upwards, and you have to be both precise and quick. In combination with the slow planning of your bounces you’ll be replaying levels more often than you should.\nCoins can be found in every level and collecting them allows you to buy stuff from the shop to make things easier for you. It will let you jump higher or give you even more speed, but keep in mind that if you die all loot found in the level you were playing in will be reset. Again, I think this was a poor choice. You want people to improve, but if there are people that can’t continue because of the game or the person him-/herself than you should give them a choice to improve themselves. The shop might just help with this and by resetting the coins every time you die they’ll eventually won’t be able to complete the game. Unless maybe they put a whole lot of time in it. It’s obviously an entirely different story if a character can’t be upgraded and is already at its best.\n\nThe level design is very, very bland and lacks charm and personality. So far I’ve only seen an industrial and underground design but I hope that there’s more to see than that. This could use a lot of work.\nNow, the game is definitely not just about the graphics but they do help to immerse people into a game. And this doesn’t cut it. Not for me, anyway.\nThe music reminded me of old school platformers, again like Mario and Sonic, but mixed with some sort of heist theme. This is actually pretty good.\n\nThere are 48 levels in total and I managed to get to around level 20 or so. This took me about 70 minutes I think. I can imagine the levels will only get harder so I can only conclude that this will take at least a couple of hours extra before you’re able to finish it. I think it’s more than enough gameplay for a game like this.\n\nIn the end I’m sad to say that The Escapist isn’t the platformer I hoped it would be. I actually hope it will escape your attention because there are so many other games out there that do a better job at being an old-school platformer.\nIf you have too much money, or you just like to collect games then I can imagine you’ll (eventually) pick this up. But to anyone else; wait for a sale !\n\n[Rating: 56/100]","September 15, 2014","false","1.3"," 84 of 99 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","84","99","3","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/315480/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","This game is a testament to why quality control needs to be better-utilized on steam, because this game is so, SO bad in every aspect that I can barely call it a game.\n\nThe controls:\nGround movement is the only thing that is the least bit functional. You move at a decent pace and can turn around on a dime.\nAir movement, however, is about 90% of what this game does wrong. Pretend that every level is the ice level, but only while you're in the air. Also, you go insanely fast. I cannot even begin to comprehend how this got screwed up so badly. Landing on a 3-tile platform is a challenge with how little control you have in the air.\nThe dash function is meh, it works sometimes, sometimes you careen off in a random directions.\n\nNow, the failure of a control scheme makes the game bad by itself, but it would at least be tolerable if the developers had realized how bad the controls were and designed levels with that in mind.\n\nNOPE.\n\nThe entire last third of the final world, I freely admit to using speedhack on, because there is absolutely no way of getting the level of precision needed to clear most of those levels at normal speed; this comes down to the controls being flawed. The levels aren't *awful* on their own, though generally nothing to write home about, but they'd be a decent challenge even in a game with good controls, and they are basically impossible with this game's poor excuse for controls.\n\nThis is the closest a game has come to being "unplayable" for me without literally failing to boot up.\n\nOh, uh. The rest. The story: doesn't exist. Literally. The art style: Ehh, it's okay, the 3D models superimposed on the 2D landscape look a bit off. The music: Boring, grating chiptune crap.\n\nIn summary: There is absolutely no reason to buy this game. Hundreds of better platformers out there, this won't even entertain you if you're really bored. It'll only make you question why you were so stupid as to get this game in the first place. Thank the lord I got this as bundle fodder.","October 19, 2014","false","5.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","19","23","2","0"

I would not play this game if it was free. It is appauling, it is comepletely and utterly terrible. I cannot believe I have this installed on my computer without Microsoft Security Essentials ringing the alarms for malware. This game makes me depressed, I cannot play this game without feeling as though I'm about to ♥♥♥♥ out my internal organs. I find myself questioning whether this was made using an older version of scratch by a 6 year old filipino boy. I cannot stress enough, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME! Do not even stay on this page for longer than 30 seconds as you might be at risk of developing cancer. I am so angry that this is even called a game, it's worst than any russian torture method I know of. Save yourselves from this horrific piece of trash.

Reviewed from the perspective of a dad on a budget here is my gameplay review and continue reading for more.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SvzE52qDJQ\n\nI am 3+ hours deep in this game and it has caused a wide range of emotions. Excitement contentment joy and rage, frustrations and helplessness. If I had given up after an hour of play I would have not recommended this game. Luckily I pressed on and have grown to really enjoy this game. It has it flaws. The controls are a bit janky and take some time to get used to. The tutorial does not really help and upgrades are really important for progression. Once you get a hang of it this is a super fun game. It is fast paced and provides a lot of variation between the levels so it constantly feels fresh.\n\nYou will die hundreds of times before you beat it, I’m pretty sure I died 40ish times on the first boss but when you beat a level it is so rewarding.\n\nFor me a Steam on the Cheap game has to have a ratio of $1 per hour of gameplay or better. I am 3 hours in and have plenty of game left so this is a great budget game that will keep you coming back for more.\n\nf you want to know what other cheap games are worth the money check out my Podcast Steam on the Cheap where I review Cheap Steam games and let you know which ones are worth your time and hard earned money.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/steam-on-cheap-discovering/id899847567?mt=2","September 19, 2014","true","4.7"," 7 of 39 people (18%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","18","7","39","2","0"
