In case the situation turns bad, I know exactly who needs to be blown up.”\n\nSpace Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is a hybrid 2-D space simulation crossed with a real-time strategy game developed by the company Minmax Games with emphasis on combat mechanics and tactics.\n\nAtmosphere & presentation:\n\n+ Large amount of ships with creative designs guarantee a lot of variety and enable a corresponding learning curve.\n+ The salvage and mining mechanics keep up the motivation to explore new star systems.\n+ Size and mass of ships influence movement and inertia of each vehicle.\n+ Late game introduces an ever shifting equilibrium of power.\n\no The faction system adds an interesting dimension to the game, but it has little impact on the behaviour or decision making of the player.\n\n- Amount of side missions and randomly generated events throughout the galaxy are limited and repetitive.\n- The musical background lacks variety.\n\nCombat & gameplay:\n\n+ Fluent combat mechanics create a dynamic battlefield with focus on tactical positioning.\n+ Each ship offers different customization options for weapon and auxiliary systems, which benefits the tactical spectrum of the game.\n+ Easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master skill tree challenges the player to gain more experience.\n+ Late game requires a more strategic approach of the evolving situation.\n\no Everything on the map can be attacked and destroyed.\n\nCharacters & story:\n\n+ Story telling has a surprising and refreshing twist.\n+ Well done integration and development of the zombie threat.\n\no Stereotypical portrayal of characters.\n\n- Very little voice acting during the entire game.\n\nSummary:\n\nMinmax Games succeeded in creating a well-rounded game with only a few rough edges. SPAZ delivers much more action and tactics than one might expect of this indie title. The urge to unlock the next ship class, spending points on the elaborate skill tree or collecting credits for the next weapon upgrade will keep you up late into the night. And the entertaining zombie plot will come around the corner when you least expect it.\n\nAchievements:\n\nEstimated time for 100 % completion: +50 hours\n\nSingleplayer achievements: 48\nMultiplayer achievements: none\n\nChronology:\n\nSpace Pirates and Zombies 2 (PC)\n3-D space simulation + real-time strategy\n(Science-Fiction) – Planed release in 2016\n\nSpace Pirates and Zombies (PC)\n2-D space simulation + real-time strategy\n(Science-Fiction) – 2011","September 15, 2015","true","92.8"," 85 of 91 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","85","91","2","10"

The game is fun, features a considerably deep ship designer; as challenging as you wish it to be and it looks good. The low points are the dialogue, which is thankfully sparse; early balance (good luck getting anywhere if you choose to research beam weapons instead of cannons!); lack of information regarding the effectiveness of your ship design and, for some, though not for me, the control scheme. These issues, however, do not detract from the experience in a significant way. 8/10, looking forward to the sequel.","December 8, 2013","true","37.6"," 59 of 65 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","59","65","0","0"

You operate out of a main “mothership” and tackle quests and missions piloting smaller craft alongside AI Wingmen. The combat is difficult, but rewardingly so, and requires thought and sound tactics especially at the later stages of the game. I definitely judged this book by it’s cover when it was first released, but it is certainly no run of the mill twin stick shooter.\nThe RPG elements are shockingly deep; you gain levels, rescue crew specialists upgrade weapons, collect ship designs, outfit your wingmen, and participate in a simple but very effective economy trading rez (currency), goons (crew) and data (xp).\nVisually the art is great, lots of vibrant colors, really unique ship designs, combat effects are satisfyingly meaty, characters are well drawn and the dialogue, while crude, is interesting and humorous.\nThe only issue I have come across is playing SPAZ via in home streaming. Considering the visual fidelity of the game, it seems like my gaming rig has an abnormally hard time encoding the video of it. I’ve found that using “DirectX Compatibility” and “Capture Mouse” helps make it playable, but there are still numerous visual artifacts and glitching seen on the remote computer.\nOverall a brilliant game, and I’m truly looking forward to the sequel!","November 10, 2014","true","74.8"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","28","29","0","0"

I've spend about 5 days straight playing this one, and I still hungered for more.\n\nSPAZ, or Space Pirates and Zombies (And Bounty Hunters) feels unique. You've got a small fleet of spaceships, and your objective is to reach the center of the galaxy, in search of a fabled load of Rez, an exceptional element discovered in the future capable of being transformed into any metal you need - starting ALL THE WAY BACK from the edge of the Perseus arm, where Earth is currently situated. You can assume direct control of any of your ships at any time in the field - being able to switch back and forth at a moment's notice, while the AI takes care of your other ships for you. You also have a Tactics panel, from which you can evaluate the situation of the entire battlefield and give orders to your fleet, set action stances, order reinforcements, etc. You can also DESIGN each and every one of your ships - you can unlock different hulls, weapons, modules, you name it.\n\nYou'll find yourself dragged into a MARATHON once you get a hold of it. There's only one problem, though: the game is a bit grindy. The Milky Way is ENORMOUS, so there can be quite an expanse between your location and your objective in it. You'll find yourself battling through a load of star systems just to reach your next mission or unlock the newest upgrade, and that takes time and resources - most of which you'll be grinding out of mining stations/enemy fleets if you're careless. If it weren't for the grinding, this game would be perfect on my book. But still, it's VERY enjoyable.\n\nHas a great story - but I don't want to spoil it. Play your cards right and the game will go easy on you. Screw up, and expect to spend a few hours grinding for Rez.\n\nDEFINITELY recommend. You'll need some patience, though.","July 11, 2013","true","45.6"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","35","41","0","0"

On top of that they shift gears at the end game and throw in a light turn based strategy system on top of it.\n\nResource mangement can be a grind and a drag at times as your progress comes to an almost literal deadstop because your enemies are simply way too strong for you to even make a dent in their armor. Time has to be spent collecting resources to build ships while buttering up the factions for each system you visit for the tech upgrades they have unless you want to blow their stations to pieces so you can just take it instead, either way you're going to have to stop and smell the roses a few times, more than a few if you lose a lot of ships.\n\nThe plot is a throwback to the classic days as well, no "deep" triple A slop here, just a decent story to keep the action going with a predictable unfolding if you pay any attention at all and a great ending to lead into the second game which I am now highly anticipating. Overall an excellent title for anyone who likes classic action, tactics and maybe a small sense of conquest and conquering at the same time.","July 5, 2014","true","41.7"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","33","41","0","2"

You gain power by gaining favor with two factions and buying weapon blueprints. You get ship blueprints from beating those ships. For me, getting those blueprints and seeing what each new ship or weapon could do was the most fun part of the game. There are many different types of equipment and you have limited upgrade points, so you'll have to pick a few trees to go down until late game when you can really pack on the level up. This gives the game some replayability if you like.\n\nCombat is fun and you have a lot of options. You can put out a big, expensive ship and just mow down enemies, or you can put out a small fast ship that can't take much damage. While the small ships do die quickly, they are much less expensive, making it an important issue to consider. If you get low on resources, you can't build your big ships and have to either do easy missions or go mine. There are places to do so relatively safely, but that's the slight grind I mentioned.\n\nI only had two issues with the game. The first relates to the factions. There are two and in each system they will have different feelings toward you. If you make them happy or mad in one system, it won't affect them in another. This is actually good. The problem is that one faction is always the one blocking the warp gates leading to other sectors. They must be cleared before you can move on. So you must either bribe the guards, which is extremely expensive, or attack them and ♥♥♥♥ them off.\n\nThe second problem is that the end game got very boring and "samey" as I cleared system after system. However, that was me being completionist. You can finish the game without doing so but more systems cleared will give more aid in the last battle.\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun. I'm not ready to jump into a second playthrough yet, but I'm happy with the time spent with this game and I will be keeping an eye on the second.","November 30, 2015","true","63.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

I've had this for a while thanks to a bundle and I've seen it pop up on Steam, TotalBiscuits WTFis and probably some other sites saying this game was good. I was thinking I wasn't into the Newtonian movement kind of games, like Asteriods, which is a good classic of course, but it's kind of annoying to control your ship. I started playing and it reminded me of the Dreamcast game, Armada, which I bought for cheap long after the systems death and got really into. There's that "one more level" factor as you gain levels to improve your ships, gather rez as currency, kill enemies for data (XP) and Goons that can help you at your base, be sold to traders, or automatically ejected from your ship if they aren't willing to work (in which they comically flail around and scream before either dying in space or being shot or ran over - it's quite amusing). I'm playing on normal with reduced bounty hunters and increased tech, so i'm kinda playing on easy and I'm not sure how much I'll like it (I feared I wouldn't because it might be too hard for me).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/107200/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is a top down space shooter game with a level up system for technology and a rudimentary economy system.  The majority of the game is space combat similar to the old multiplayer game “Subspace” but with no power ups (and you kind of design your own ships).\n\nSPAZ technically has a story but you probably won’t pay attention to it for most of the game since you’ll be exploring the galaxy for long stretches between “story missions.” You play part of the crew of the Clockwork, a ragtag mother ship headed for the galactic core to mine precious minerals.  Unfortunately the galaxy is mostly controlled by the UTA, a powerful organization kind of like the Empire in Star Wars, except not really evil. The UTA has its own problems though, the colonies are rebelling, and everywhere you go in the galaxy there will be fighting between UTA and colonial warships.\n\nThe game’s galaxy is randomly generated when you start a new campaign and is made up of about 100 different star systems randomly connected like a spider’s web (if you’ve played FTL, it kind of looks like that, only much bigger). Each star system has a number next to it, representing the “tech level” of the star system. In practical terms, you can think of this as the “difficulty” of the star system. In order to progress to different stars, you need to somehow unlock them. For example if you go to one star, it might be connected to 2-3 other stars and each of those 2-3 stars has a separate warp gate that needs to be unlocked. You can unlock a gate by either killing all the UTA ships around it, or by bribing the UTA to let you through.\n\nThis bribery brings up an important aspect of the game. Every time you enter a star system you are given a relationship status with the colonists and UTA. If you’re hostile to one of the 2 factions, they’ll attack you on sight and you won’t be able to trade with them. To bribe the UTA, you need to be on friendly terms with them. You change your relationship status by taking missions for that faction. For example to raise status with UTA, take missions destroying colony ships (which will lower your colony relationship). The relationships aren’t galaxy wide. You can be friends with UTA in one system and their enemy in the system right next door. You do not get chased from planet to planet no matter how bad your relationship is.\n\nCombat in SPAZ is pretty straightforward. You control one of three ships in your little fleet and can switch freely between them. The mothership stays in a safe place rebuilding your ships if they get destroyed. When enemy (or allied) ships are destroyed, they drop a “blueprint” which you can pick up to unlock that type of ship. Later ships require more copies of the same blueprint. For example to unlock a particular fighter, just destroy it and pick up the blueprint it drops. “Data clusters” dropped by destroyed ships are the “experience” of the game, and you gather those to level up. On level up, you can put skill points into various technologies, such as shields, beams, missiles, etc. This allows you to use more powerful tech (that you have to buy separately). Money in the game is a mineral called rez that you can mine from asteroids or pick up from destroyed ships. The money is used to buy tech from space stations (as long as you’re friendly with that faction). New tech items are actually pretty scarce; you need to make do with your combat skills most of the time.\n\nPros:\n+The game is surprisingly complex. This would be a great game if I had no backlog to keep me going. Years ago when I had not many games to choose from, I would have spent a lot of time on SPAZ.\n+There is no difficulty option, but if you’re having a hard time, just go to a lower level star system. There is nothing keeping you from backtracking or skipping entire star systems. Also, very often a star system will have open battles between UTA and colony ships when you are neutral to both factions. You can just sit there in the battle and wait for a ship to be blown up so you can snag the data/blueprints. Obviously this works better on high level star systems where you’re too weak to fight either side by yourself.\n+Interesting weapon / defense dynamic. Beams do extra damage to shields, cannons do extra damage to armor, and missiles do extra damage to hull. Your ships can only load 1 or 2 weapon types each so you need to have a nice variety in weapons to be able to take on all enemies. Plus, combat is very fast paced and some weapons are easier to hit enemies with than others (missiles are homing).\n\nCons:\n-As I mentioned above, new tech is few and far between. A star system will probably only be selling 1 item, and it probably won’t be what you’re looking for. And in order to actually buy the item, you need to be friendly with the faction that’s selling it. That means doing missions for them (and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the other faction).\n-The game is a tremendous grind. The faction relationship thing mentioned above is one example. Another is unlocking additional ships. You have to hunt down and destroy specific ship types to unlock them. Not so hard in the beginning, but in the end these are massive battle cruisers that can easily kick your ♥♥♥. And you need like 10 blueprints to unlock them.\n-The technology level up system is weird. You need to save up skill points to unlock higher levels of tech, for example unlocking level 3 missiles requires 3 skill points, level 4 requires 4 skill points. Yet the game will keep nagging you if you try to save the points. If you try to diversify, you’ll end up at a disadvantage. (If you’re playing an RPG, you don’t put a point into every skill).\n\nOverall, I’d give Space Pirates and Zombies a tentative thumbs up. You can sink a lot of time into the game if this is your cup of tea, but for me there’s too much grinding. The pluses outweigh the negatives, but only just barely.\n","October 13, 2014","true","8.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","1"

Its not really avoidable, to avoid being steamrolled by each group of enemy ships you will have to grind data to ensure your tech level is consistently 5+ levels higher than them not to mention you'll need to grind for blackbox data to build better ships. Assuming youve stuck it out that long you'll find yourself with extremely limited hangar space, which means that in the vast majority of battles you are greatly outnumbered by superior ships.\n\nI tried addressing the game's shortcoming with mods but the modding component of the game appears to be broken as none of them function and i cant be arsed to fix something that should be working when the game is just not compelling enough to warrant it.","April 16, 2014","false","7.9"," 41 of 64 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","41","64","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/recommended/107200/","fortheussr","chairbender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/","342 products in account","The style and idea behind this game are appealing, but the game is made unpleasant by several glaring design flaws.\n\nYou only ever seem to have around 3 ships to control at once. That doesn't really give you much in the way of tactical options. You're frequently put into situations where you go up against way more ships than that, so it feels strange to have only one large ship and two small ships and be expected to feel like you're being strategic/tactical.\n\nThe issue with the tactical options is compounded by the need to grind a lot to have weapons strong enough to take on foes of a given tech level. The damage system is interesting, you have shields, then armor, then hull. Beams are strong against shields, cannons are strong against armor, and launchers are strong against hull. However, according to the DEVS THEMSELVES, a good strategy is to only focus on upgrading one of beams/cannons. What was the point of the damage model if you're just going to suggest people not worry about trying to match up the correct weapon based on the situation of the enemy ships? Because I didn't know about this, I was getting to the point where most of my time was spent grinding to at least 1.5x the tech level of the enemies I would go against. It seems like the designer didn't really think about how the damage and tech level system really affected the fun of the gameplay.\n\nThere's a lot of time spent just doing repetitive mission types over and over again to get data so you can level up your tech. It gets old after awhile, even though there's a decent variety of mission types, once you play a certain type once, it isn't really fun to play it again. The only thing to keep you going is a desire to progress through the story or feel like you're "being productive", but really you're just doing the same stuff over and over again. It doesn't make for very fun gameplay.\n\nThe whole idea of the Bounty Hunters is also an issue. Bounty Hunters in space is really thematically appropriate, but the way it's implemented in this world just adds unpleasant busy work. Every time you do missions you accrue "bounty". Whenever you jump, if your bounty is high enough and your near a bounty hunter lair, you'll be attacked by powerful ships and probably will have to reload a save. The only way to get rid of bounty is to go to a lair and pay them, or complete "arena challenges" which net you some Rez and relieve some bounty. The arena challenges are very fun, but I frequently found myself in a situation where I had maxed out my Rez so I just had to pay a bunch of money and never really felt a reason to play the challenges. It's just a resource sink without much fun behind. If it was possible to beat bounty hunters when they attacked you I would consider this fixed. There's plenty of other ways it could be improved, of course.\n\nOther than that, there's just lots of little annoyances throughout the game that indicate a lack of polish. One petty example is that, on escort missions, the ship you are escorting might have cloaking, but will be invisible to you, which makes it difficult to tell where you need to be. Escort missions have other problems, like the behavior of the escorted ship (it will sometimes go in the opposite direction, won't follow you, etc...). This is just one example of a minor design issue. There's others; like the heavy reliance on saving and loading (breaking immersion and breaking up the flow of the gameplay).\n\nOverall, it's insulting to Mound and Blade to call this game "Mount and Blade in Space". Mount and Blade lacks a lot of the issues that make SPAZ unpleasant (after a few hours of playing). Unlike games like Mount and Blade, I just never feel like I'm becoming more powerful. I don't feel like I'm interacting with the galaxy because all the solar systems are very closed off from each other.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that actually gives you a sense of strategy, tactics, and power, you should look into Starsector (formerly Starfarer), which is currently playable though in-development. I think it does a better job of providing the sort of experience this game was trying to provide.","October 11, 2014","false","15.4"," 41 of 64 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","41","64","0","0"

SPAZ is almost completely non-linear - You can visit a lot of galaxy sectors without touching the main storyline.\n\nGameplay reminds me of another great game "Escape Velocity Nova".

Space Pirates and Zombies is a action-strategy space shooter with elements of random generation. While you have some control over how random it is, it only serves to increase or decrease the difficulty in the long run.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is pretty solid. You pilot your ship around with WASD keys, and shooting your weaponry with the mouse. What makes it special if that you don't point and shoot, but the direction of your ship controls where your shots are. If you place a weapon on the front of your ship, expect it to shoot forward until the higher class ships which have rotating turret mounts that do just that. Even then, anything other than lasers will still need to lead the target, as nothing is hitscan. This makes shooting more skill based.\n\nAt the same time, you have to pilot your ship to avoid incoming shots from enemy ships. This ends up leading to dog fight type scenarios where you and your opponent are dodging around each other trying to get a shot in. This is where a lot of the enjoyment of the game is, since a lot of battles will be decided on whether or not you can out-maneuver the AI, especially on higher difficulties when the enemies become too strong to kill in a head-on fight.\n\nAs you kill enemies, you can pick up orbs of Data to level up and gain research points. The tech tree is nothing complex, since it is mostly just a direct % increase in damage and other stats for each weapon or ship subsystem. This is however needed, since more powerful versions of equipment are unusable until you level up that system. But before you can even  equip something, you must acquire the blueprints of each item. Naturally, higher level equipment requires more blueprints, which can be obtained by the faction bases. Either buy from them, or blow it up and loot the charred remains of the base, if you can.\n\nThe Bounty Hunter system adds in some extra challenge to the mix, if you choose to allow them to spawn. Killing enemies within their territory increases the bounty on your head. Eventually, if left unchecked, the hunters will come after you in an attempt to collect that bounty. The higher your bounty, the higher the chance. You also have the chance to be extorted on the way out of one of their systems. Failure to pay and you'll need to fight them off. You'd think this would increase your bounty further, but instead gives you respect, which lowers the bounty. If the bounty falls into the negative, you start to gain respect points. This acts as a buffer before you will start accumulating a bounty, and ensures you won't be attacked until you drain all of your respect.\n\nAnother way to gain respect, as well as money and Data, is to fight in arena matches set up by the hunters. As you progress, harder challenges are unlocked, each with 3 difficulties. If you want to avoid ambushes every are or two, you may want to take advantages of these arena matches. They can even be repeated for a lesser reward if you are out of fresh fights. And if you really have no other option, you can pay your bounty off yourself. As a whole, this system adds more challenge to the game, which is welcome when not playing on the highest difficulty.\n\nThere's much more to gameplay, but I don't wish to drag on. So I'll end with one major flaw I found, and that mostly comes with the late game. If you fail to kill one of the smallest ships but weakened it to critical health, it will flee. For several thousand feet. If you don't switch to a small ship of your own that is just as fast, it will get away, and you'll spend minutes at a time waiting for it to come back. This becomes a huge pace breaker, and sometimes even causes you to be put in more difficult situations in the late game, when enemies can spawn just by you staying in an area for long. Maybe if they would retreat from battle, leaving the area entirely, this wouldn't be an issue.\n\nStory: The setting is that of a far future, and space travel has advanced to that of colonizing other star systems. This is mostly thanks to the currency of the game, Rez. This subtance is mined from deposits floating in space to craft vessels. In order to become rich, many set off to mining colonies to gather as much Rez as they can. Legend also has it, there is a grand deposit in the center of the universe. This deposit is what our protagonists are looking for. The only problem is getting there. Warp gates between star systems are guarded by the UTA, the police space force, essentially. Not only this, but the grand warp gates to the planets near the center are locked down tight. A nice twist comes in the zombie part of the title, which you discover upon finally reaching these center systems. I'd elaborate, but I don't wish to spoil it.\n\nGraphics: I care very little for graphics as long as they are serviceable. Meanwhile, SPAZ has great graphics. Each ship looks nice, if simple at times, and the lighting is bright and colorful.\n\nSound: The music of the game mostly boils down to ambient noise, but there are a few tracks here or there that are enjoyable. Cutscenes are also narrated by TotalBiscuit, who does a fine enough job. Though even he says he did terribly, and it is clear enough that he could have done better if he tried. The sound effects are all well and good, meanwhile. Each weapon has its own shot sound effects, and the sounds of another ship being hit are clear to hear. But after awhile, hearing the pew pew pews of the game gets old.\n\nOverall, the game is a terrific time. It serves as a challenge when it needs to, and is just pure fun to shoot stuff in space. I'd recommend this to anyone who thinks they might enjoy this when shown any gameplay.","October 11, 2014","true","120.7"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

It took a awhile of grinding on the lower level systems before I managed to force my way through the gate. This is a game where going up against ships 5 levels higher can be brutal, but can also be fine, depending on what the ships are given in the area by the random generation.\n\nThe addition of bounty hunters gives another edge to the game, with their special challenges (which involve a specifically designed ship and not yours) based on skill, not your current progress.\n\nThe game mixes it up when you reach act 3 by introducing the zombie faction, which plays against the other two factions (Civs and UTA, or 'police'). While the first two can be befriended, the zombies are always aggressive. When a zombie ship is killed, it explodes into spores and zombies, which can corrupt your ships into zombie ships. This can be devastating if they get your best ship.\n\nIn the final act, act 4, the game again changes it up my adding a system control element because (story spoilers:) the zombies are now a much larger threat so the UTA and Civs now work together with you as allies. This bit feels a bit weird, but these systems now gather resources for you (rez (main currency), goons (crewmen, secondary currency) and data (experience)), which can help in the endgame area, where your ships cost significantly more, your levels take a lot of data, and you chew through goons and rez upgrading systems.\n\nIn summary, good fun game, great combat, eh story, can get grindy at times and the ship customisation is great.","February 24, 2014","true","44.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

You can see the challenge rating of each star system, so you know what you’re in for before you go there, and if you want some relaxing fun you can just pop back to an easy system and kill everything with impunity. There are lots of spaceships to discover, and lots of weapons, that will suit your playing style and dexterity.\n\nCombat is the central part of the game, you have a number of ships to field, and the AI is decent. Combat takes place on a 2D playing field, and you have a God’s eye view of the whole map, so finding things to shoot is easy. Sometimes it gets tedious racing around the combat map to reach waypoints, or protect space ships with no self-preservation instinct.\n\nHowever, by the time I was ¾ of the way through the game it was getting tedious. I was only driven to complete the story, I could barely tolerate entering more combat because it was becoming repetitive. I did finish the game, and I did enjoy completing the story, but I can’t see myself playing a second time.\n\nOverall, I recommended this game as a good distraction.

Now, onward to the actual review.\n\nSpace Pirates and Zombies, or SPAZ for short, is a real time roleplaying strategy game developed by the two-man team MinMax Games and was released back in August 2011. SPAZ is generally well-received and the success of the game spawned a sequel with the same name released only recently as an Early Access title.\n\nThe game takes place in a distant future where the center piece of the conflict revolves around the discovery of Element 126, or Rez as it's more commonly known. With rumors of the abundance of Rez reserves at the galactic core, you and your crew of space veterans sets out on a voyage to seek the fabled promise of fortune. Of course, things weren't always that easy as the galaxy is in turmoil with the clashes of the oppressing UTA forces and the desperate civilians factions. Not to mention the rising report of zombies incident and the notoriety of the bounty hunters that stalks each system.\n\nThe gameplay is done in a top down fashion where you control a single ship while the AI controls, depending on how advanced your mothership The Clockwork is, several others and they will assist you to what nature that you've set them via the Tactic panel. This panel acts as your drawing board for devising strategy on how to approach the situation. The game is paused while the panel is open and you can select units and commands them either to attack, reposition or follow you similar to the conventional real time strategy games. Another unique feature is that while you're in this panel, you can access the hangar menu and customize your deployed ships, whether to change them to a different better-suited hull or switching out ship parts to better adapt to the situation. All of this are done in real time as you close the panel so make good use of the Tactic panel to turn the battlefield to your side.\n\nThis game relies heavily on exploration and the game is GIGANTIC! It amazes me of what two people can achieved with the right motivation. Moving back to the exploration part, you'll have to jump from system to system via the warp gate, searching for rare blueprints to outfit your ships better, recruiting vital crew members which provides significant bonuses to your whole fleet, reverse engineering various hulls so that you'll have more options in combat and various others. Based on what you've chose early on, the galaxy can contain to hundreds of system at once and this will lead to potential hundreds of hours of entertainment.\n\nGenerally, the game revolves around 4 factions, the United Terran Alliance (UTA), the Civilians, Bounty Hunters and... Space Zombies. Yeah, I'll get to that in a bit. In a system, every action that you take will result in these factions react differently. Anger the UTA too much and you'll have their ships raining beams and missiles on yours and vice versa. To make it worse, in some system where the Bounty Hunters resides, your actions might increase the bounty on your head and collect it too much and you'll have some skilled hunters on your tail. There's also an arena mode held in the Bounty Hunters space station where you can undertake specific challenges in terms of scenarios. Succeed and you'll be awarded with Rez and reputation. I haven't got too far into the game yet but the zombies seems to be the byproduct of a failed experiment and for some reason, it affects ships, or zombies piloting the zombie ships? I don't know but it's pretty whack to be honest but I guess zombies sells.\n\nNow, let's move on to the pros and cons, shall we? I hope this will explain why I said the game didn't get me hooked.\n\nPROS\nThe game is HUGE, even with the least preselected systems generated! Fans of exploration games will love this as there's always the itch to go to the next system, one jump after another. Although I haven't had the chance to tingle with the mods yet (available in the site's forum, if I'm not mistaken), I can sense that the replay value is extremely high, given the interests.\nThe combat system feels tight as every aspect of your fleet are customizable and proper planning and strategy will lead you to victory.\nFor a relatively old title, SPAZ still holds well in the graphics department. It's nothing groundbreaking but each new system and planets are an eye candy to look at.\nOn the technical side of thing, the game runs flawlessly with consistent 60 FPS throughout the game and I've never experience any crashes of the sort. There are also various settings provided from the launcher before starting the game. Steam basic features are all present and functional.\nNEUTRAL\nThe initial loading time is considerably long but I guess that would be better than constant loading time in the game.\nCONS\nThe biggest thing that annoys me is how floaty the ship's movement felt in the game. I'm not sure if it's stats related or anything but controlling the ship is a pain and I honestly could not get the hang of it.\nThe factions system feels pretty shallow. Each new system has their own relationship meter for you and it doesn't feel like any of your actions are particularly impactful other than towards the bounty hunters.\nEven though the world is huge and lots of places to explore, I just can't help but feel that almost every system is more or less the same. Maybe I'm just too early in the game but that's how I simply felt.\nThe tutorials, while good, are pretty lengthy and I admit that I almost quit before realizing the the first hour I've played is only part of the tutorial.\nThe sounds in the game in general is very underwhelming. The explosions from blowing up ships are no where near as good to how it visualized. The soundtrack is also forgettable at best. This is a shame since I generally enjoy listening to in-game soundtracks.\nThe UI and text feels too small at times and this is a major problem for players with big monitors.\nDespite all the flaws I've listed, SPAZ is a great game, tailored to the niche of the genre and I have to say that they've done it beautifully. Sadly, however, the game doesn't appeal well to newcomers alike and the I can only give it a decent 3 / 5.\nLike I've said, the game fail to keep me interested from exploring any further, even the previously reviewed Drox Operative appeals more to me. However, if games like this are your cup of tea then by all means, go for it. I'm sure in time you'll receive your money's worth because the contents are just enormous.\n\n\n\nFor similar reviews and fantastic giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/.","May 28","true","6.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","2"

I originally bought it on sale through Amazon.com, long before they added the Bounty Hunters to it. I purchased my Steam version when it went on sale recently, just for the added joy of getting the achievements. I mention this to note that my hours in game are far more than my Steam account suggests.\n\nThis game is actually fairly simple to play and even master. Though the graphics look awesome, they are just 2D, which makes the game run fast and smooth. The controls are easy, and the galaxy is totally customizable in terms of size and difficulty. Obviously, the game has some replayability value, since I've played all the way through at least 3 times, collecting all the tech I could find each time. For me, this is one of those games where I don't come back for a while after playing through it, but when I just want to blow something up, I can come back and be pretty close to my old skill level.\n\nBe warned: the story and writing are kind of weak. I haven't looked too hard for mods that might help improve this aspect of the game. I just wanted anyone expecting a grand space opera to be aware. The game's charm lies in the concept and ease of the controls.\n\nIf the game goes on sale, I'd highly recommend it to people who like top-down, sci-fi shooters, as well as those who like RPG style build-up-my-force-as-I-go games.

Instead it uses awkward mouse-aim + WASD in a top-down game, and ten hours in I haven't seen any ship or weapon that really takes advantage of that.\n\nSpeaking of ships and weapons, there isn't a wild diversity in either - you pick a size of ship, decide whether you want the slightly faster one or the one with slightly more weapons, and kit it out with variations on lasers, projectiles, and homing projectiles. Bombs are basically big missiles with long cooldowns, and fighters are just missiles that fire more often. Combine this with a tech system that results in weapons/systems you don't use much being typically weaker, and the game at hour ten feels very much like the game at hour one. Point your ship at the other ship and hold down both mouse buttons.\n\nThe great big open starmap looks good until you realize the only real variant from system to system is the level of enemy ships and the presence or absence of bounty hunters, which seem to exist primarily as arena locations and also as another way to slow down the player by putting bounties on their heads. The missions in a level 1 sector are the same as the ones in a level 35 sector.\n\nThe in-game chatter is terribly repetitive after only a few hours, though it can be turned off.\n\nSo yeah, kind of a dull game.","October 23, 2014","false","10.9"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

It's an all out blast of a top down space shooter, and has a cool sense of humor as well. There are a solid variety of balanced ship types and weapons, and the faction relationships being different for each star system makes it hard to really mess up. The one complaint I had is it felt like a real grind having to build yourself back up after losing a big fight. There should be a faster way to regain resources at high level.

You have an entire squadron at your disposal, but can only directly control a single ship at a time. The others are handled by the AI, but you can and you swap between ships with the press of the button. Each ship can be upgraded or swapped out for different ones better suited to the challenges at hand.\n\nInstead of flags and bases, the game pits your squadron against varieties of enemy ships. Your squadron jumps from system to system in the galaxy, mining for resources to upgrade your ships while completing different missions. There isn't too much variety in the gameplay, with most of the missions boiling down to "blow up everything that isn't yours." There is a story, too, but it is pretty thin.\n\nI got a kick out of the game, mostly for the nostalgia of playing something similar to Subspace. The lack of variety and paper-thin story hurt the game, and give little reason to grind your way to finish.

THe replay-ability is extremely high becuase the uniqueness of every ship makes you want to unlock them all especially the later tiers of ships. The randomness of each system ensure that every place to warp to is a surprise. The zombie mechnic(although implemented much later into the game) provided a rush of fresh air (lol) so far into the game that grinding through systems to the center became tiring. The highe level ships are very impressive, providing yet another reason to finish the game. One of the most fun times i have had with this game was when i traveled back to the first couple systems, with fully upgraded war shi[s and absoluting dominating all of the ships/stations that gave me grief at the begining of the game.There are many features that I still have not mentioned, but I will spare you them for the sake of both our mornings/afternoons/nights.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hisshiss/recommended/107200/","Hisshiss","Nabudis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hisshiss/","163 products in account","This is an extremely open ended game, and while the core systems are established early and relatively easy to pick up, there is alot of depth and agency in exactly how you chosoe to navigate through the game. That being said, it is most definitely an RPG, and while the game will never stop you from trying, there are plenty of times when you just aren't tuff enuf for what you are going after just yet.\n\nI find this game incredibly soothing, just drifting from one system to the next doing randomized event, blueprints for new tech, weapons and ships trickle in at a constant rate, and you have huge freedom when generating your game when it comes to difficulty, the size of the galaxy, and even the pace of the progression by way of blueprint rarity and the spawn rate of bounty hunters, long and short, its a randomized, extremely streamlined meditative romp through space that operates on the very specific terms you decide.\n\nAs with the rest of the game, the combat is simple but hugely satisfying, there is just the perfect level of depth to combat systems when it comes to things like the difference between shields, armor and hull, as well as what sort of weapons work best against them, and the presence of multiple hangers and AI controlled ships (whatever ship you aren't using the game takes over for you) means you can create very specialized fleets to address problems the way you want to.\n\nAs for minor gripes, the game can get a little repetitive, as with the exception of some quests that inject interesting litle subplots (some of the side quests are also insanely funny, the whole game has an air of dark humor to it), you will mostly spend countless hours just knocking over one system to the next, farming research levels and either grinding relations or flat out nuking NPC bases to get their blueprints, and beyond that formula the game doesn't change itself up much from start to finish.\n\nLast point, and this is super subjective, but I personally felt that the default hanger slots, as well as the max ship size allowed for each hanger is far too conservative, even with the higher teir mothership in the later game they just don't give you enough ships and size to really flesh out the satisfaction of leading a squad of ships of your own making. Thankfully there are multiple developer sanctioned mods that increase hanger slots and size relative to the rank of the mothership that can be used to solve this if you feel the same way I did,  http://www.minmax-games.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=3108 being the one I choose to use. Be adviced that in the case of this paticular mod, it only modifies the hangars and nothing else, which means that other than potentially losing some AI ships faster (Cus you have more of them) and thus burning rez to rebuild them, it does not rebalance the difficulty of the game at all, so keep that in mind when deciding on the difficulty settings.\n\nAll in all, fantastic game if you are looking for a progression based experience to mellow out and sink countless hours into.","April 10","true","23.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You start out as a little 4-hardpoint ship, just plunderin' the good plunder. As you progress through the story you'll find out something crazy has stirred up at the centre of the universe. Something that allows flesh eating monstrosities to biologically enhance and drive their own ships, despite being mindless husks. The story has an enormous gravity to it; as the plot progresses, your fleet of AI-controlled ships, blueprints, hull types, weapon types, subsystem effectiveness, mining ability and the like go on the up as well. Doing this makes the player feel the gravity of the situation: there's a huge threat of space zombies capable of surviving without oxyen floating about at the center of the universe and you're going to need all the help you can get.\n\nI suppose the reason why I find this game so enjoyable is an amalgamation of perfect game dynamics; the tactical RTS-like command of your own ship, with a main player-controlled ship and up to 4 other AI controlled ships, all of which are available for the player to directly take control of any time during flight. Missions are undertaken for either the civillians of a star system or the UTA - the universe's private military force, and doing favours for one faction often angers the other. The ever expansive tech tree is a delight, as well - research data, the space equivalent of experience points become increasingly important to get that rank of weaponary, subsystem, engines, or armour that you know you're going to need at the current system. As time seems to go forward when you jump from planet to planet and star to star, the players get used to planning a route according to a star systems ecosysem, 'difficulty' (measured in civillian or UTA strength) and managability.\n\nWith the addition of vicious money-hungry bounty hunters to the mix, I've never enjoyed any space-sim-top-down-physics-based-shooter as I have with this. I've found myself dedicating chunks of my gaming sessions to mining, exploring, trading, or fighting in this game. And when you finally get all the blueprints, all the ship hulls, and high-tier tech skill upgrades,  you're still finding yourself having a blast dealing with pesky space zombies. In a nutshell, I haven't quite experianced any game like this but I can sum it up into two expressions: YARR and BRAINS.","July 10, 2013","true","107.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Flying 2D spaceships and accepting missions is a lot of fun, and I have fond memories of other games of this type.  This one, though, feels a little lacking in some areas.  You get a decent variety of ships and weapons, plus a tech tree to spend your upgrade points on as you level up.  There's a big galaxy map, except that all the systems feel kind of the same.  There's only 4 factions (military, civs, and bounty hunters, plus the titular zombies that come in later on).  Oh, and your reputation with 2 of these factions, instead of being global, is system-by-system, and randomly determined.  So, you could hop into a new area wanting to do business with one of them, only to find out they hate your guts, and you'd have to take missions for them (or bribe them) in order to turn that around.\nThere are plenty of randomly generated missions to undertake, but aside from a few plot-related side missions these are all repeatable and repetitious.  The main obstacles standing in your way are the warp gate blockades, preset enemies you have to fight to proceed to the next system, so a lot of what you're doing is just knocking these guys down to get from A to B.  Sometimes you have to train up and get more resources to take on a tough outpost, but other than that..\nThe big draw here is the combat, and customizing your ships, outfits, and tech the way you want them.\nIf you like 2-D spaceship-flying games, this'll be right up your alley.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boncottled/recommended/107200/","boncottled","Boncottled","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boncottled/","160 products in account","Simply fantastic. If you are looking for a good old 2D space adventure game where you can: a) Unlock many different ships, weapons and components, b) Upgrade various aspects of your ships, c) Be a pirate and prey on civilian ships, d) Bribe officials and manipulate relations with the police or the civilians, e) Use a massive battleship to blast a starbase to pieces and collect the loot because you didn't want to pay them for it, f) Participate in bounty hunter battle events and win their respect, g) Use this respect to order the bounty hunters to attack a warp gate blockade for you, h) Fight zombies, i) Battle squads of enemy ships and blow them to bits, and pick up the jettisoned crew to join your ranks, j) Rampage through the galaxy and cause general chaos in each individual solar system... then you should buy this game.\n\nThe devs said that they created SPAZ because they couldn't find games like it anymore. This is sadly true, but now you can play this game so it's all okay. It is not the most fast-paced or the most action-packed game (although big battles are quite exciting) but it doesn't try to be. It is just a completely amazing space adventure that lets you choose where to go next and what to do when you get there.\n\nYou are let loose in a galaxy that you design (for the most part), and you are free to explore solar systems, mess around with politics, and level yourself up so you can venture into harder areas. To get to a new system you have to either destroy the UTA (police) warp gate blockade, bribe them with goons, or use bounty hunters to clear the blockade for you. You can then continue to the next system, and because there is no communication between systems, the people there will have no clue what you have been up to. In each system there are small, basic missions that you can do, and occasionally a conflict pops up between the two sides, which you can join in.\n\nThere IS a storyline, which is quite intriguing, but the story missions are relatively few and quickly jump to much harder areas. You have to explore and level up before continuing on, but you can do the story whenever you really want, or if you get bored of exploring all the other solar systems, because they are mostly the same, and when you have acquired all of the blueprints that you get from lower-level systems, there is not really much need to go all the way around the galaxy. But it's still fun to go to every place, especially if you are someone who loves exploration.\n\nThere are lots of ships of varying sizes and all of them are designed for a different purpose. You can easily change between ship designs and equip different weapons and support modules. Later on in the story you get more hangars, which means more ships. You can only control one at a time but you can freely swap between them, and the AI controls the others. You can give orders to your AI-controlled ships, although they can be pretty frustratingly stupid sometimes. Especially when armed with huge bombs, because they fire them off everywhere as soon as they reload, usually causing high damage to you or friendly ships, which quickly turn hostile.\n\nCombat ranges from not-all-that-interesting with smaller ships, to exciting, lasers-and-giant-explosions when several large ships are pitted against each other. Many small details have been perfected in this game, some of which are: shockwaves from exploding ships will damage anything that is too close, and firing on one side of a ship will wear down the armour and allow you to deal more damage, as well as causing minerals and crew members to be sucked out into space through breaches in the hull.\n\nYes, there are zombies in this game. They are found in the central solar systems. They are very annoying (they have a tendency to split and create more, and there are lots of them) and can be dangerous and head to deal with if you are not careful. Luckily, both the Civs and the UTA hate the zombies as well, and there are often conflicts between zombies and one or both of them.\n\nThe graphics are nice, the backgrounds are nice, the ships all look nice, the explosions are nice, sound effects are nice, everything I have mentioned previously in this review is nice. You might not like this type of game and that's fine, but if you are remotely interested in the concept then you should definitely buy it. The price is overly reasonable, especially on sale.

With difficulty I finished the job.\nNow, that may seems insane, but when you learn how the CPU ships are going to try to attack you, you'll set your ships to different modes to make use of their evasive moves and such.\nThis game is great, there is a ton to do, from persuading people you're on their side to blowing up bases.

There is even bounty hunters that are not part of any factions and that can hunt you down if the bounty on your head is big enough.\nThere is one big problem in this game : there is a time when you need to grind a lot.

Ignore the story, and focus on configuring your ships. My 40 hours on a single playthrough is proof of how much fun I had. Some may find the combat repetitive eventually, but I found the steady trickle of new weapons enough to keep me invested. I love this game and am very excited for the sequel!","April 26, 2014","true","40.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All in good fun, though. It's a good top down space shooter with a lot to do, some quirky humor, and several different ways of playing (though maybe only a few work best in Insane difficulty -- canons and stealth are your friend until you build up the tech to face things head on). It can be a bit grindy at times, especially when you get to the Zombies part of the title, as you'll want to acquire powerful tech and ship blueprints to deal with them (and this goes double especially on Insane difficulty). But, if you get into it, you'll barely notice all the time pass until you've suddenly put in over 100 hours.\n\nA good, well-put together game at a cheap price. Worth the full price.

I was wrong. Whether it was inspired by SC or not, I don't know, but if you liked SC and want a modernized version of it, SPAZ is the best that there is.\n\nIf you haven't played Star Control, I will give you the gist of what SPAZ is. Spaz is a top down space shooter. You are in command of a band of Space pirates. With humble beginnings, you can gradually work your way up and become more powerful, reverse engineering ships that you destroy, gathering resources to build researched ships and to buy blueprints for new modules to go on them. You can fly into combat with a small fleet of AI controlled allies, toggling between the ships at will to command for yourself.\n\nIf you like games with depth and action and don't care about graphics, I fully recommend this game.

There's a lot to like here; the one thing that's a little hard to get used to is the controls are relative to your ship, and not to the screen.

You destroy ship to get XP and ressources to buy bigger, better ships to be able to destroy more ships. Each planetary system has 2 factions, and you can choose one faction or the other in each system. Later in the game, you can destroy some zombie ships, and it gives a little more challenge to the game. There is even bounty hunters that are not part of any factions and that can hunt you down if the bounty on your head is big enough.\nThere is one big problem in this game : there is a time when you need to grind a lot. I've played 24 hours and I still haven't finished the game because I need to grind the XP and the ressources to go further in the game.\nIt's truly a good game and I had a lot of fun playing it but it takes a lot of time to finish.","June 4, 2013","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recommend playing on a fairly challenging difficulty and playing a very large game (as in, the largest).

Top down action, RPG elements of leveling the components your ships are made of, souring the systems and planets for new components, and constantly facing new tactical challenges in every battle. The game does get pretty grindy around midway through the story, and keeps getting even more grindy, but if you're smart enough with effectiveness of weapons against certain ships, you'll have a great time.\n\nI saw people complain about "very low and old graphics" and "horrible repetitive gameplay", but I believe not every game has to be a top-notch ultra-realistic adventure. Many indie games are going towards the good old 8-bit days, with pixelated graphics yet such good gameplay, and this game is no exception.\n\nThe graphics in terms of overall experience are at times cartoonish, and the dialogue can be either funny or dumb to the right person, yet you shouldn't expect a lot of seriousness inside the individual lines. I myself found it very entertaining, although later on I started skipping more lines.\n\nRating, I'd say 8/10 for me. A little grindy, and could maybe use a little more polish on some very minor elements. But again, there are no games I have played that I have enjoyed 10/10, hehe.","December 29, 2013","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Weee!) invested into it there are still high replayability, and that's some of the most engaging 100 hours I've had from start to end, just for the cheap price of 10USD. Amazing, simply amazing.\n\nThe Pros\n-Customization\nWith 5 tiers (tiny, small, medium, large, huge) of ships (43 official ships in total, but there are mods that add in even more ships), each with a wide variety of slots to put different kinds of modules (weapons, boosters, subsystems etc.) as well as armor plates, shields/cloaks and reactors. The tech tree has 15 categories to invest into up to 10 times each, which is also nice. You can easily shape your fleet into killing machines with powers matched only by gluing 3 death stars together (or small cloaked dodgey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s if you so desire).\n\n\n-Replayability\nEach galaxy is randomly generated with multiple options and difficulty settings to further refresh your experience each run. The abundant amount of research also allows you to spec into another weapon type in the next run, allowing experimentation.\n\n-Reasonably Priced\n\n-Multiple Save Files and Autosaving\n\n-Modding-friendly\n\nThe Cons\n-AI\nThe AI in this game will definitely not impress you. Even on the highest difficulty (insane) enemy AI behaviours don't deviate much from their normal cousins (they are, however, significantly more deadly.) The worst offender in this category is the friendly AI, as they are going to be your major source of fustration in the game, especially on higher difficulty settings. The commands you can give them aren't much either, but sufficient.\n\n-Death Scream\nWhile thankfully, only your own units performs death screams occasionally when they die, the default death screams in this game are ear-shatteringly loud, and almost made my heart stop the first few times. You can counter this by sliding the unit chatter slide bar all the way to the left, while keeping most other sounds intact.\n\n-Glitches\nWhile highly infrequent and never game-breaking, the game is also not well-polished enough, and glitches and bugs do pop in at times. Thankfully all I've encountered so far can be resolved by restarting the mission or reloading a save.\n\nEverything else (plot, music, art, graphics etc.) are relatively okay.\n\nConclusion\nI highly recommend this game to fans of the genre, it is simply a masterpiece at its core with a few rough edges sold at an alluring price.","May 30, 2014","true","622.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This little indie game is much better, and played far more often then many of them.\n\nIt puts you in command of a little squad of ships, one of which you control directly. You hop around from system to system doing jobs for factions and trying to upgrade you ships.\n\nThe ships are very configurable, and there are quite a few of them to play around with.\n\nAll of this is very addictive. I've blinked and realised a couple of hours have flown by while I've been hopping accross the galaxy looking for that next level reactor part, or missle launcher, or new hull.\n\nThe size of the galaxy is configured at the start of the game, and a huge galaxy is really huge. Looking back at that statement, it sounds funny, but it's true :).\n\nIf you find the whole zombie craze very tired (like myself), don't be put off by the fact that it's in the title of this game. The zombies aren't really a "more brains" kind of thing, but more like the reavers in the movie Serenity.\n\nI've gotten a lot of value out of this game. I really don't think you can go wrong if you decide to pick it up.\n\nOh, and they're working on spaz 2 right now.

All in good fun, though. It's a good top down space shooter with a lot to do, some quirky humor, and several different ways of playing (though maybe only a few work best in Insane difficulty -- canons and stealth are your friend until you build up the tech to face things head on). It can be a bit grindy at times, especially when you get to the Zombies part of the title, as you'll want to acquire powerful tech and ship blueprints to deal with them (and this goes double especially on Insane difficulty). But, if you get into it, you'll barely notice all the time pass until you've suddenly put in over 100 hours.\n\nA good, well-put together game at a cheap price. Worth the full price.

Having not completed anything other than easy or medium, try not taking this review into account for the harder difficulty settings.\n\nThe game itself starts off slow when you are given the worst of the worst ships named the Short Bus. This thing's beam cannot kill pretty much anything. But new and better ships start coming along very soon with the player going from the worst laser ever to lasers and cannons. (For the cannon think of a rifle in those games where you can hold down the trigger or whatever, where it shoots at a moderate speed.)\n\nEven though the guns get better some poeple may still think of them as utter crap as the better stuff comes in much later.\nAlso new players may find the shooting with both lasers and cannons very frustrating and have the A.I do most of the work.\n\nThe game also features 3 resources. rez, goons and data.  Rez a brightly coloured space rock that doubles as the currency of the game  as well as the raw resource that you build your ships with. The game does a very good job of allowing you to collect rez and not loose it. The enemy ships, you will be fighting, nearly always drop a nice chunk of rez for you to loot whereas your ships deposit your supllies of rez into a large pool that you (mostly) cannot lose.\n\nThe next resource is goons. Goons are workers/slaves/mercenaries that you pick up in escape pods floating around in space. Picking them up ads them to your goon pool much like your rez pool. Unlike rez, goons are used to keep your ship in tip top shape once it is flying, rather then build it. The amount of goons that join you when you pick them up depends on your crew skill.\n\nYour crew skill is an indication of how well you keep oder/how much they like you. At first this skill will be very low, level zero in fact. At this low level most of the crew get thrown out of the air lock of your ships instead of being crewed. This could be a bit frustrating as 6 crew can suddenly turn into 3 crew as half are chucked out the air lock for being troble makers.\n\nBut there is usally so many crew pods, you rarely have this problem.\n\nThen there's the last resource data. Data are little bits of trashed computer parts and what not, scattered about the place after you trash a bunch of your foes. Data is unique in the fact that it can generate itself as well as goons.  Every time you collect a certain amount of data, starting at about 100 (eazy to do as you collect it in tens at a time) you clone a certain amount of your current goons into new ones.\n\nData also allows you to progress along a tech tree of sorts as each time you level up you gain 3 points to spend. The points can be spent in things such as shields thrusters or drones. Each certain amount of points you put into a certain category upgrades it a bit. And with the best weapons upgraded to the full level (10) or even a little below it (8) you can blast and melt your way through whatever even looks at you funny without a care.\n\n\nNext up(ALERT! ALERT! SPOILERS INCOMING!)\n\n\nZombies. Zombies come into the game at a very late point which is a bit weird considering the game is called space pirates and zombies. They can be a bit of a pain if faced without the right equipment, for example without a point defence system (a little red cricle that shoots a red laser at incoming zombies and missiles) they can swarm your ship, take down its sheilds, kill its crew and infect it, turning what was once your best ship, against you. Another slightly annoying thing they do, is spawn the very tiny ships called ticks that, once injured enough, will fly faster then you can to the edge of the screen causing you to retreat back to your mother ship and then warp to a new place, rather than just warping, as you cannot warp when there are enemies nearby.\n\n2nd last on this reveiw is bounty hunters. Bounty hunters can be a HUGE pain in the backside as they track whoever you kill, causing your bounty to rack up. Once this bounty is high enough it will cause the bounty hunters to come after you for that sweet bounty on your head. If not prepared properly these guys can wreck you and your ships pretty fast. That's why I recommend for any new players to turn them down to low in the starting settings. This will make sure you are not getting smoked by them every time you warp to a new sector, but also allow you to find out what they are like and how they work.\n\nLastly are space stations. Space stations are big shielded things that stay in one place. But be careful who you anger in this game. As flying to a space station, when either it is to high a level for you or you are to low a level for it, can leave you with no rez or ships if it blows them all up. Also a tip for a mid level mission, in which I got stuck on for a while, where you have to shoot a space station untill it gives up its reactor for you. My tip is if you can't beat it at first just grind a bit of low level stuff first. Trust me, at first it may be boring but it defenitly is worth it when you beat the station and move on to the better parts of the game.\n\nWell, that just about wraps up this review and my few last words are: A good game for most poeple, but better if you're patient and don't mind a bit of a grind.","December 4, 2013","true","229.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game was made by only two people.\n\nThe universe you are set in is randomly generated and has a small amount of customization in size. The smaller the universe, the harder the difficulty between each galaxy. The bigger the universe, the longer the overall game and the more stretched out resources are. The game tells you not to do your first playthrough on the hardest difficulty. I immediately went and ignored this because I love a good challenge.\n\nAnd boy does SPAZ deliver. You have up to three of your own ships in play at once. You can manually control one of the three ships at any time and the AI will take over the other two. The combat can go beyond mindlessly killing at times in the harder difficulties and thought is needed to plan out what you are going to do. Getting a game over is rare but progression is also challenging.\n\nGood for casual and hardcore players.

The key differences being: RPG aspects (levels, tech skills) and the deeper strategic element. I wasn't expecting as much fun as I'm getting out of it due to how slow the combat is compared to an EV game.

The end game is wretched. When I say wretched, I mean it is nothing short of a chore.  "Hunting" down the infected aliens is less of a hunt, and more of a mindless chase. They run the opposite direction at speeds near yours, only they'll be at distances like 30,000+ . . .\n\nThe goal is to "clean up" a system, or you're labeled as a ♥♥♥♥♥ for not completing the mission. The problem is the real ♥♥♥♥♥ is the coders that can't think of a decent combat. The combat will be over, long over, like ages  . . . and ages  . . . and ages over, yet another stupid tiny infected alien will spawn on the other side of the system. At this point, the only thing you can do is turn around, and have a mindless wait as you drag your ship slowly across the "system" (a needlessly large grid) to get to the point where you easily pop the tiny ship.\n\nThere are great battles, don't get me wrong, it's the hell that is mis-labled at the game that gets my "No" for recommend.\n\nOn top of the lame "zit popping" adventure, there is a new element added to the targeting system, where the turrets refuse to aim toward anything you are choosing to shoot at.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/garrickwinter/recommended/107200/","garrickwinter","GarrickWinter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/garrickwinter/","508 products in account","This is a game with a great core gameplay loop - load up a couple of ships with various items and fly them around frantically through a swarm of other ships blowing stuff up. The action-oriented 2D combat is great fun, with surprisingly great physics and object interaction for such a seemingly simple game. The fact that the plot and the elements in play radically changes halfway through the game is a bonus, and works great even though the zombies are spoiled by the game's actual title.\n\nThere are a few issues I had with the game though. Grinding for resources and data can be quite a hassle - the less you grind, the harder the combat is, because your equipment simply won't be as good. Updating your tech RPG-style is really compelling, but unfortunately not every tech is created equal. Techs all cost the same, but it seems clear to me that investing 50+ skillpoints in, say, Hull strength or Shields is vastly preferable to investing the same amount of points in something like Bombs (a really specific type of weapon) or Crew (only situationally useful). Maybe this depends on playstyle, but I tried investing in things like Subsystems or Launchers at first and found the benefits just weren't as tangible.\n\nAlso, for a game that probably takes even experts 30+ hours to complete, the fairly small number of mission types gets old fairly quickly.\n\nThat said, the core gameplay is really fun and made it worth it for me, and the sense of progress you get teching up and defeating fleets that would have smeared you to a paste several hours earlier is tangible and rewarding. If you've got a lot of time and like a simple 2D action game, give this a shot!","May 25","true","44.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/107200/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","The first thing you'll notice about SPAZ is the customization.  Do you want to play in a massive galaxy?  Do you want to be starved for technology?  Do you want to turn off the Bounty Hunters entirely?  You can do that.  The customization of course applies to the many different ship types, such as what armament to use and even the level-up system, so maybe you want to focus on shields first or maybe you like the punch of cannons so you focus on those.\n\nSPAZ is not an RTS, but it has some elements, like having resources to manage (albeit it's just REZ for money and Goons for slave labor), which you use for the production of your up to four ships for your small fleet, and both are used for the purchase of new weapons blueprints.  You also have to maintain relations between you and two factions, or three with the included And Bounty Hunters expansion.  Do you fight the UTA for the benefit of the CIVs, or do you backstab both groups for your own profit?  This is complicated by the fact that every sector has its own faction relation to you, and anything you do in one sector has no effect on the rest.  But that's where the Bounty Hunters come in.  There are light RPG elements too, mainly in how you spend your upgrade points in what trees to bolster your ships and enable the use of better equipment.\n\nThere is a good variety of missions, like destroy X many crates without being seen, or destroying a big ice meteor before it plows through a research station, or the simple "kill everyone of this faction" and everything rewards you with money, people, and typically a change in faction relation.  Or maybe some new equipment, or even a little bit of story.  The game changes pretty drastically during the final chapter, though you are given advance warning before this point.  And you don't even have to do missions all the time.  You can just pop by the mining colony and chip away at meteors for money...only for one of the groups you ticked off to suddenly warp in and you're now scrambling to send away your mining ships for battle ones.\n\nThere's a good bit of stuff to do and collect and kill in this game.  I especially like the fact that you can custom-tailor your experience to start, though there's no way to change that once you've started.  Battles are oftentimes difficult and relying on your AI allies is an exercise in frustration, but learning the nuances of the weapons and how much impact the different gear you can equip to every ship is essential for victory.  Do you want a massive battlecruiser with extremely strong shields and armor?  Or maybe a tiny ship with extreme speed for hit-and-run tactics?  Why not both?  You can only directly control one ship at a time, but the ability to swap at any time might be essential to keep everyone alive and to keep your coffers full.\n\nAnd this game has no discrete "game over" condition, as you can always fight back from zero even in the final chapter, though it will be tedious and difficult to rebuild your fleet when you've no REZ nor Goons.  And while you're slowly chipping away at stray rocks in the Short Bus after a massive defeat, you'll be thinking up a plan to exact your revenge.  It will be glorious.\n\nSo yeah.  SPAZ is a game I like.","June 29, 2013","true","68.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","5"

Seriously, this overhead shooter has everything you want in a space combat action game.  The controls are accurate to being in space,  the weapons are all balanced really well, as are the ships!  You grow more powerful over time, and discover new tech.  The story, while not the best, its still well thought.  There are even mod tools available on their game forums.

Where this game really shines is the gameplay itself. You can try out a lot of different ships, which they do actually feel like different ships with completely different hardpoints and options. Some ppl think the balance is a little off, but I disagree for the most part, losing ships once in a while is to be expected which is why you have resources to make more in the first place, plus, if you stay in the "green" leveled areas (or yellow if skilled), you never have to worry about being overpowered by stronger enemies. I also like the fact that the more skilled of a player you are, the more chances you can take by going in the more difficult areas of the world (so you can either take your time and not have much difficulty or you can go hardcore on it and fight enemies way stronger than you and complete the game much faster).\n\nEven at full price, I highly recommend this to anyone who is into this kind of game.","September 27, 2014","true","38.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I remember playing a game called Star Control when I was a kid and SPAZ seems very keen to evoke those memories.\n\nThe bulk of the game is spent carrying out missions (i.e. quests) which will reward currency and/or reputation with each system's faction. Speaking of which, each system has two sides: UTA (Empire) and Civilians (Rebels). You don't always have to butter up one or the other, and which side you'll have to ♥♥♥♥ off will vary from system to system. It's very much up to you how and where you want to go questing, but the levelling process can feel a bit grindy.\n\nThe combat is fun but not overly deep, and things can get a bit repetitive. I've put 30 hours into it so far and I've only really just got into the meat of the campaign I think. At a sale price, I'd say it's worth it. I wouldn't be disappointed to buy it at 50% off so anything else is a bonus.\n\np.s. If you're on the fence, TRY THE DEMO. It's a good taster.","March 19, 2012","true","66.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The biggest detraction is that I find the gameplay a little grinding. To advance between systems you have to be about equivalent or better than the technology level of your enemy. This means you often find yourself grinding to get your tech level up, respec your ships, and then go blast away the bad guys. If you fail to do this you find yourself quickly decimated by an AI who has superior firepower. While I may not have the finer points of ship selection and counter measures figured out, I think this is a fair assesment of the gameplay. Despite this flaw, its still fun to shoot lasers at brightly colored ships until they disenegrate into start dust...and then zap their crew members as they writhe around helplessly in space.","January 16, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Space Pirates and Zombies is an open-world, 2D space-themed shooter and everyone should buy this game. Not only is it amazing that a team of two created this, but they did a really good job on it. They did a better job than some large game corporations have done on games before. Amazing combat, soo much to do, hilarious dialogues, really cool story, and you have ultimate control of how you get to point B. You can power your way through, or take your time and get everything one step at a time, just depends how you like to play. This game is for all styles of gamer and you should get it!

I guess -.5 for the tutorial skipping on a few much needed pointers/tips. I highly recommend reading and/or watching some tutorials.\n\nThere is one on youtube that I watched where a dude plays through the beginning but doesn't do a great job explaining what each thing is so it's probably best to find other info out or play the demo and then watch his vid like I did\n\nYeah, I did the demo for an hour and kinda kept it in the back of my head that dying was ok because it wasn't the real game yet, so this may be a good strategy for others.

Seems like you can play it for a long long time. There is as always a lot to learn in a Space game like this, but the learning curve evens out quickly and the game shines after that. It's something akin to Master of Orion from back when the dinosaurs ruled the arcades, but then again it's a lot of things not similar at all.\nEven with a small production team they have been able to create quite the amount of content. I can't wait to see if it keeps up the surprises and if wether or not it scales well.\nCheap game, big world to explore, many hours of fun, and the devs hope to upgrade the game with more goodies in the future. Thumbs up from me.","January 28, 2012","true","28.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The developers have just released a free add-on pack, so I'll no doubt revisit the final zombie frontier.  Would I reccommend this.

They did a better job than some large game corporations have done on games before. Amazing combat, soo much to do, hilarious dialogues, really cool story, and you have ultimate control of how you get to point B. You can power your way through, or take your time and get everything one step at a time, just depends how you like to play. This game is for all styles of gamer and you should get it!

Despite the cheesy title, this game is actually a really fun game all in all, mixing all sorts of things into the game.\n\nStoryline in a nutshell: New element, Rez, is discovered. This one government, the UTA, uses this element to make warp gates that can let ships travel to different solar systems. However, they're total warp-gate nazis and the civilians dont like it, so they get their own ships and start fighting UTA (peaceful civilians... who said that?) ships all over.\n\nJust a little background knowledge.\n\nNow, what you do is use these ships to take a side on factions... don't worry, whatever you do will only affect faction relations in the system you're in, which means you can go take down a huge UTA convoy, go to a different system, and poof! Aside from that system, nobody gives a crap! Very fun gameplay, and when it comes to taking sides, its always open for change. However, you will start at different levels of relations with factions per system, and... whatever.

The result is a game that looks like hockey pucks on an ice rink flying around, shooting wildly at each other. It's really unpleasant to play.\n\nI've played the tutorial mission through twice now, and each time I have come away wondering why I would want to continue.

Everything is boring, nothing gets you entertained.\n\nSPAZ is a space "shooter" game and when you are used to control fast engines, in this game it's freaking slow and for the best part of the game, you're shooting lasers, because missiles are mainstream.\nYou mostly take 10 minutes to kill a piece of sh*t with those lasers and again, when you think you're almost having fun, the ennemies are flying 20 000 km away but they won't leave the area, no, because you're having fun chasing them for nothing.\nIn the end I got with a ship I couldn't destroy because he was escaping me anytime he's almost dying. And when he's out of my sight, he regenerates.\n\nThe game has more than 100 areas to explore, all of them look the same and are infinite in length but empty of things.\nEach area has missions, pretty boring ones and repetitive.\nIt also has a level system, 100 levels it seems, but totally useless because every ability you increase does no effect! It's only useful for new engine parts: lasers, shield, cloak, etc.\nThe level can also tell you how hard an area can be. But you will always die more than 20 times before clearing one.\nThere's plenty of ships to unlock, each ranged by class: small, medium, large, huge. You won't get something good before getting a huge ship, that means, in the end of the game when you have nothing else to do.\n\nHowever, mods can give a great visual but nobody gives a.. and only 2 mods are available: halloween and xmas. wow.\nI admit I played with a trainer but even with that it's a pain to play this horrible game.\n\n2.5/10","June 30, 2014","false","9.3"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

Most times if feels like you are just spinning around on one spot shooting things. Very little manovouring. Movement is similar and sometimes it's difficult to see if you are moving since there is usually a large planet in the background, which barely moves, so it throws you off. As well during combat there is little feed back visually or physically. Meaning your ship hardly reflects any damage or somehow impacts your movement. I know the game is created by a small team and is well done for what it is, but the above really is important, I think, for a game to have. I might give it more time.

It isn't just enemy pilots about to die; it isn't just in dialogs with lowlifes; it is in the ambient sound for the game itself (presumably intercom chatter aboard your own vessel). Totally unnecessary, and adds no value to the game.\n\nNow, after turning the noise completely off, and ignoring the dialogs (which you can probably get away with, since the in-game indicators tell you what you need to do next), you can get around that objection, so what is left?\n\nA lot of grinding. I don't mind grinding, generally, but I appreciate some sort of appreciable reward for grinding. Admittedly, I didn't go far in the game, but the whole time I felt behind.\n\nRegrets that I can't give a positive comment.

Unfortunately the game doesn't do a very good job at immersing you like some of those older games do. The universe feels pretty shallow, and some of the tackier interface and portrait artwork can break immersion. Although many aspects are quite antiquated, the combat system is its redeaming factor, and is the primary focus of the game. I would suggest starting with a smaller sized galaxy since progressing through the game's story can drag on a bit and require more grinding otherwise.","December 20, 2014","true","48.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You start with almost nothing and build your way up to the commander of a squad of ships. As you complete story missions, you gain access to larger hangars which means larger ships to command. You can manipulate your enemies and scavange their ships after they've destroyed one another. You can eradicate infections and undermine the local rebellion or authority figures.\n\nPros-\nFun! Collecting the various weapons and tools, then customized your ships to find the best combinations is hours of enjoyment.\n\nUnique! Not many games I've played have the variety of units and unpredictability of SPAZ. I've seen ships that shouldn't have succeeded destroy others that are twice their size.\n\nCons-\nWash, Rinse, Repeat- A bit repetitive at times. Requires lots of time grinding to find the blueprints for all the ships. Not always the most fun, but it DOES make getting your first HUGE ship so rewarding.\n\nAngry? Have some Goons- Very easy to manipulate the factions by bribing them with goons (a sort of influence currency). Once you're on their good sides, you can just wait for them to butt heads and collect the cash, goons, data, and blueprints left over from their conflicts. Not super challenging.\n\nBraaaaaaains- The Zombies are very unique and sometimes absurdly over powered.

Defeat a new type of ship and you get their blueprint.  Get enough of that blueprint and you can build that ship.  Blast your way through blockades, or trade and bribe your way past.\n\nThe loadout interface is surprisingly easy.  It's fun experimenting with different components and weapons on different hardpoints of different hulls.  Do I add a way stronger blaster and hope I don't run out of reactor power in the middle of a fight?  Do I prefer speed or maneuverability?  Cloak or shields?  Bombs, drones, torpedoes or missiles?  Tracking turrets or forward-facing sheer oomph?\n\nThe middle-end of the game gets a bit grindy, but the collector/completionist in me still has plenty to do.

Every mission you do makes you want to push on to see what's next, got to get that next ship or that next weapon.\n\nGRAPHICS: are very detailed for a 2D game and throw out some nice effects, for example the explosions are pretty decent with bits being blasted off as you bring down a ship slowly, crew being sucked out of a breach in the hull and there are some rather nice backdrops with small details you can appreciate when you zoom in.\n\nSOUND:  isn't overbearing, there is an effect for everything but it just lacks a little punch for my tastes.  I would have liked the weapons to sound a bit meatier, right now they sound like pings and pops. The explosions however do sound pretty good when you blow up something big. There is some interesting and funny radio chatter that will put a smile on your face.\n\nMUSIC: very much suits a game of this type, it doesn't try to overshadow the sound effects or deafen you when you're in a firefight...which is almost always. It's the kind of music that sticks in your head when you're not playing the game.\n\nYour currencies are well balanced and you never have too much, you will of course always run out but then there's always a way to make back the lost currency, unlike a lot of games where you have way too much money and nothing to spend it on, I really do hate that in a lot of games.\n\nI'm blown away by how addicting this game is without feeling like it's a sugar rush. What I mean is that it won't give you all of the cool stuff in the first 5 minutes of the game and then you have to grind for another 50 hours without anything awesome to discover. No, this game is one of the best paced games I've ever played and the balance of leveling, tech points and weapon acquisition over the course of the entire game will give you the feeling that you ate the whole cake, not just a bunch of icing or just the cake without icing.....if you catch my drift.\n\nAt the time of this review, I've clocked 45 hours but I'm still having a blast, still have a lot to discover and upgrade but at the same time I kinda don't want to finish this game. You know something is good when you want it to go on. I just hope SPAZ 2 has that same feeling....","October 6, 2014","true","92.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good thing for me that it was, because now I'm 20+ hours into it and I'm loving it!\n\nI'm finding a surprising amount of depth and customization in this little indie game. At first, I was a wee bit turned off by the arcadish, Asteroids-like combat. Eventually, I learned that I could build a mid-size command ship with an automated turret armed with a cannon or beam weapon, with me manually controlling the ship's guided missile launchers. With this, I could return fire on an enemy ship while circle-strafing around it, keeping my weakened shields/armor facing away from it. Meanwhile, I could have a couple of small, AI-controlled teammate ships to pepper the enemy from its flanks.\n\nSo, I grew to love the combat! Especially as I got even deeper into the tech research/acquisition and ship customization/optimization. (Now I'm starting to explore the use of a carrier as my command ship, which launches squadrons of fighter-drones into battle.) The game has become, for me, less arcadish and dependent on hand-eye coordination/reflexes, and more tactical and dependent on thinking/planning.\n\nAnd not just tactical, but strategic as well. Strategic in battle, when figuring out how best to deal with enemy fleets and space stations, but also strategic when plotting my overall route across the star map and  my individual routes within the separate star systems; and also when dealing with the game's three factions (the military-police, the rebel colonists, and the anarchistic bounty hunters).\n\nYes, a great little indie game, especially for a two-man design/developer team. I've already placed the upcoming sequel for SPAZ on my wishlist!","September 23, 2014","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a plot, some narration, but honestly the level of the dialouge and the amateur art designs for the charcacters caused me to ignore it after about 10 minutes.\n\nThis is Diablo in space, you manuever around, try to damage opponents and mostly are just trying to click at the right times to line up shots against VERY agile opponents.   You also constantly have to keep track of how allies are doing, your ship is usually worse then your competitions and there are more of them then there are of your fleet (as opposed to most ARPGs where you have an advantage but you are facing a horde).\n\nIt is very easy to die but that's ok, because using your mined resources you can then use them to respawn yourself and your fleet.  But you can and will run out of resources, therefore making you not be able to respawn, at which point the game tells you to go get in a very very very crappy ship and start mining, but anyone with common sense will tell you to reload your save instead to save you the mindless grinding that would entail.\n\nThis is grossly dissapointing because I feel there is a lot to this game, it generates a new galaxy for every game which would seem to have a huge amount of content but I couldn't get past the second star system and had great difficulty getting past the first (which was the tutorial).  Maybe this game was made for the nintendo hard crowd, or maybe I just suck, but I just don't have the time or patience anymore to deal with that.  Although after looking at the universal badge progress on this game, I can tell I'm not alone.\n\nDon't trust the metacritic score, although I will say there is something here but you have to be pretty dedicated/skilled to find it.","September 19, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You start on the outside of a galaxy and fight your way through worlds and space police checkpoints to get to the center og the galaxy where everyone prospers. There's a decent backstory behind it.\n\nAt times the game really feels like a grind, but thats okay, it's an RPG. You fight, gain exp, and upgrade your stats. The usefulness of stats are: small passive bonuses (aka armor bonus, % health increase, etc) and your skill level allows you to slot the different parts (weapons, armor, etc) onto your ship. There's like 12 -15 different areas to level up in i believe. Like shields, armor, hull (general structure integrity once armor is gone, aka ship health), engines, reactors, beam weapons, etc. It's pretty in depth.\n\nIf you like games like atom zombie smasher, you'll like this. You are given a top down view of where you fly in space. There's hot keys to do various things, and you can switch between any ship flying with you in the same sector at any time. Say, your ship gets destroyed or sent to repair, you can control another one in live battle. There's factions, whether they like you or not in each sector gains you access to parts, or you can try to take them down yourself. They act as bosses bt provide decent xp.\n\nYeah, just get the game. ESPECIALLY if it goes on sale. Right now it's 80% off so it's $2 ($1.99). There's no reason not to buy this at such a steal. They're currently making Spaz 2. Can't wait. Oh, TB does some voice acting. The character voices kinda suck, but it's cool.\n\nDownsides:\nCan be a grind regardless of skill/ level (its an RPG)\nSometimes too much reading (i get lazy)\nVoice acting sucks (this doesn't affect gameplay)","September 10, 2014","true","72.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though it's quite repetitive, it makes you want to level up and explore every inch of the game. If you're underleveled in this game it really put you on a difficult spot to win. But that's also a challenge on its own so to me its a win win. There's also a lot of way you can go through galaxies. Stealth tech/Bombs/Turrets.. A LOT OF WAYS!!! That's the fun of it. For now I only use brute strength and upgrade engines and weapon upgrades but little do I know that other give me such a big advantage as well. If you're the kind of person like progression this would be it. Not to mention you can make other ships by reverse engineered the ones that you destroyed. Pretty cool system huh?? No longer you need to feel frustrated over a ship that's better than you.\n\nOverall I would give this game 8/10, It's there but after a while it would get a bit of grinding spree since the ships that you fought sometimes overpowered you by a mile.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HSFOutcast/recommended/107200/","HSFOutcast","Outcast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HSFOutcast/","417 products in account","SPAZ... oh SPAZ, how i love you... Space Pirates and Zombies is a game that deserve... Nein! It NEEDS more attention. Its a great game made by 2 great dudes. They are working (slowly) on SPAZ 2.\n\nI really have nothing, nothing bad to say about this game. The trailer they got is a great way to show off how to game works, what you see is what you get. So if you like what you see then buy it, its a great game.\n\nHere's what i think of the game. The game is a fun little game where you fly around with a small fleet of spaceship. You have a mothership that you can't control and it rebuilds and refit all your spaceships to your need. You start of with only one ship, and gain the ability to use other ships by destroying that type of ship, once destroyed the ship drops a blueprint, collect them to unlock the ship for yourself. The larger the ship, the more blueprints you need. So a small fighter might only need two pieces of that blueprint, destroy 2, collect the blueprint and the fighter is yours. While cruisers and battleships might need up to 8 blueprints, and they usally have alot more health and are harder to kill.\n\nYou also get the ability to refit your ships with weapons you want to use. Each ship has its own number of hardpoints, you can mix and match and put whatever you want on your ship. Want to fire kinetic rounds? sure. Lasers? Why not. Plasma balls? It's your ship, your rules.\n\nNow this might be a minor spoiler but they got it in the title of the game so... Story goes that you are a space pirate, each solar system is cut off from each other so what you do in one system won't carry over to the next. To get to another system (a higher leveled one with more advanced ships) you'll have to fight through a UTA Blockade, they block access to the warpgates you need access to procedd in the game, either destroy them all or bribe them to give you access. Each system has 2 factions. The UTA (Military, always blocks the warpgates with blockades). And the Civvies, they control mining and science operations in deep space and usally let you use their facility freely (So you can mine resource, et.c.). You will randomly get a faction rating in each starsystem, sometimes they love you from the start, sometimes they hate you. You'll never know. Pick your side, start blasting ships from the oppossite side and soon you'll make some great friends in that starsystem.\n\nLater on in the game Zombie ships start to appear, and near the end of the game they will be your main enemy. The UTA and Civvies notice the major zombie problem and team up together with you to reclaim the galaxy from the zombies. Zombie ships are unique ships that you can not unlock. They consist of two type of ships, fighting type ships that look like infected normal ships. They will engage anyone mindlessly. And then we got the breed type ships that look like human bodyparts of some sort. They infect ships without shields, if your ship gets infected you have little time to react, either self destruct your ship so the zombies can't gain control of it and use it against you... or make the hard choice and vent the ship of all crew except the captain, so the infection can't spread. It's a hard job late game, but someone has to purge the galaxy from the zombies.\n\nThere is also a fourth faction that was released freely with the game. And they are the Bounty Hunters. There ships are unique with specific traits and are also very, very over powered. If you go around in a starsystem they "control" and wreck havoc, you will start to lose respect with them. Lose to much of it and they will warp in when you least want it (in a difficult fight with another faction) and try to blow you out of the space, for the most part they succedd with this. One of the hardest achivements ingame want's you to destroy their space station in the hardest type of starsystem.\n\nSo will you use standard weapons like lasers, kinetic rounds or plasma to destroy your enemies? or will you go for missiles and torpedos instead? Why not use EMP weapons and energy drainers to drain all energy from your enemy ships so they can't fire their weapons or escape? Nukes? Sure, SPAZ has them. Drones for carriers, that too. There is alot to do with this game, and it gave me alot of hours of fun.\n\nThe only three really bad parts about this game are:\nInterface dosen't look very professional.\nThe story isen't that good, it had one somewhat good plot twist in it tho.\nThe last "part" of the game, the "purge" all galaxy of zombie threat's is a repeative and somewhat boring job to do. Everything before that is fun tho.","August 30, 2012","true","116.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some complain the difficulty curve is too high, especially in mid-game, but I would say that it is a welcome challenge as the AI is quite weak and they are many ways to exploit it.\n\nThere is a bit of grinding but I kind of like it myself being a bit perfectionist with games and liking to explore all there is to see and find secrets so be warned.\n\nIt's a two man game and I find that inspiring, those guys have talents and I can't wait to put my hand on SPAZ 2 when it comes out.\n\nTHe graphics are not for everyone but I personally like it and 2D worked for piloting the ships.\n\nThe music was repetitive but pleasant and I did not get tired of it.

Combat is real time action/shooter based and the base management and such is very simple to learn and pick up. So you don't need to be a rts or turn based strategy god to play this. Which is good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LifesContradict/recommended/107200/","LifesContradict","RamesGamesLC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LifesContradict/","429 products in account","It's a space RPG where you play as the ships. You start on the outside of a galaxy and fight your way through worlds and space police checkpoints to get to the center og the galaxy where everyone prospers. There's a decent backstory behind it.\n\nAt times the game really feels like a grind, but thats okay, it's an RPG. You fight, gain exp, and upgrade your stats. The usefulness of stats are: small passive bonuses (aka armor bonus, % health increase, etc) and your skill level allows you to slot the different parts (weapons, armor, etc) onto your ship. There's like 12 -15 different areas to level up in i believe. Like shields, armor, hull (general structure integrity once armor is gone, aka ship health), engines, reactors, beam weapons, etc. It's pretty in depth.\n\nIf you like games like atom zombie smasher, you'll like this. You are given a top down view of where you fly in space. There's hot keys to do various things, and you can switch between any ship flying with you in the same sector at any time. Say, your ship gets destroyed or sent to repair, you can control another one in live battle. There's factions, whether they like you or not in each sector gains you access to parts, or you can try to take them down yourself. They act as bosses bt provide decent xp.\n\nYeah, just get the game. ESPECIALLY if it goes on sale. Right now it's 80% off so it's $2 ($1.99). There's no reason not to buy this at such a steal. They're currently making Spaz 2. Can't wait. Oh, TB does some voice acting. The character voices kinda suck, but it's cool.\n\nDownsides:\nCan be a grind regardless of skill/ level (its an RPG)\nSometimes too much reading (i get lazy)\nVoice acting sucks (this doesn't affect gameplay)","September 10, 2014","true","72.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though it's quite repetitive, it makes you want to level up and explore every inch of the game. If you're underleveled in this game it really put you on a difficult spot to win. But that's also a challenge on its own so to me its a win win. There's also a lot of way you can go through galaxies. Stealth tech/Bombs/Turrets.. A LOT OF WAYS!!! That's the fun of it. For now I only use brute strength and upgrade engines and weapon upgrades but little do I know that other give me such a big advantage as well. If you're the kind of person like progression this would be it. Not to mention you can make other ships by reverse engineered the ones that you destroyed. Pretty cool system huh?? No longer you need to feel frustrated over a ship that's better than you.\n\nOverall I would give this game 8/10, It's there but after a while it would get a bit of grinding spree since the ships that you fought sometimes overpowered you by a mile.

Some multiplay, more variation (there is allot variation, but the game can be rather long so becomes repetative) and less reading could proberbly get it up on the 5.

Everything from upgrades, fighting, and leveling up has had a lot of thought put into it. This does not feel like a 2-person studio production, it plays like a passion project from a very skilled game studio.\n\nI've played 20 hours so far, which is saying something considering most of the games in my library are barely touched regardless of their rating, and can't wait until I have time to play it more.\n\nI'm looking forward to playing more of this game and cannot wait until SPAZ 2!","June 20, 2015","true","29.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
