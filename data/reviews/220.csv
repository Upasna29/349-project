Still, Half-Life 2 is no "ordinary" game. Even before it's release, it was the most talked about, and surely most anticipated game up till then. Back in 2004, Valve was still primarily a game-developer, Steam had only just been launched in order to streamline the updating-process for the Valve-games (quite an original and ground-breaking idea since back in those day patching one's game could easily turn into a hazardous adventure). Immediately after its release, Half-Life 2 was loaded with critical praise, and almost instantly rose to the top of all lists defining the best games ever. And even today, after ten years, it still tops a lot of those lists.\n\nI played it for the first time only five years ago, messing around with the original Half-Life up till then. Five years ago, the game struck me as still very good-looking and a blast to play, even being five years old. Quite recently I picked it up again, to be honest in the first place to get some of the achievements I had missed during my first play-through (I only got really interested in the Steam achievements this year). To my surprise, the game immediately got back under my skin, so I decided to give it another play-through, and I enjoyed it immensely, hence this review.\n\nOf course the Source Engine shows its age: up-close textures get quite blurry, but the wider vistas are still amazingly "alife", and the colours and general atmosphere are still exciting. The physics engine - a novelty back then - now surely feels outdated, even crappy, but playing around with the famous "gravity gun" makes more than up for this, and surely has its funny moments. But in every other respect, this game is a classic and a masterpiece in the true sense of the word. The story is so convincingly told, that I felt myself beeing "Doctor Freeman" again, already during the first chapter (which introduces the gameworld in a very ingenious way which has not been surpassed ever since). The level-design is simply awesome. Compared to modern-day shooters, the interface and the amount of information about the surroundings you get as a player, are minimal. There is no minimap, there are no waypoints, there is no compass, there is no large-scale map. And still, I never ever got lost, thanks to the downright genial way the levels are designed. Still, the amount of freedom you get is great: there are tons of hidden places, byways, or larger spaces to explore, besides the more traditional corridors, but they always manage to lead you in a logical way. This game offers the classic examples on how levels can be optimally designed.\n\nSound, too, is amazing: there is not much in-game music, but when it appears (mostly in the action-packed scenes), it really delivers to the full. Sounds from the guns, NPC's and ambient sounds are extremely convincing. But what still shines most of all is the actual gameplay and the way this games is "paced". Sneaky, almost stealth-like scenes alternate with extremely violent action-moments, in a very, very clever way, only to be alternated with puzzles and other moments where thinking is required. The choice of the right gun at the right time is essential, and very rewarding. There is a lot of interaction with other characters, but never up till the point where this gets tedious. And best of all: there are countless moments of surprise, when the story takes a turn for the unexpected. So, yes, this is still a classic, and yes, it's still up there among the best games ever (although I personally would grant it a top-five place or so, the top-three spots taken by more recent "classics").\n\nFor my scorings, I give them as I conceived the game during my actual playthrough, so not taking into account it's a ten year old game.\n\nGameplay: 27/30 (there are some frustrating puzzles and some weird moments with the gravity-gun but everything else is sheer genius)\nGrahics: 15/20 (the outer vistas are great, the rest is showing its age)\nSound: 9/10\nLongelivety: 8/10 (no multiplayer, but the game has tons of singleplayer gameplay)\nSteam integration: 10/10 (it comes with trading cards and 33 achievements, most of which really add something to game, if only to explore different ways to achieve things - the way achievements should work imo)\nTechnical: 9/10 (runs very smoothly and I got no crashes, but sometimes hangs for a couple of seconds on loading screens)\nPersonal appreciation: 10/10\n\nOverall: 88/100","August 28, 2014","true","40.8"," 460 of 483 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","460","483","6","21"

As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine.\n\nHalf Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.\n\nThe game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles.  Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane.\n\nFor a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.\n\nThe game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.\n\nThe game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.\n\nApart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs.\n\nIn the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.\n\nI experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9.5/10 -  A Must own and must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 27, 2015","true","9.9"," 390 of 410 people (95%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","95","390","410","28","6"

It was also the THIRD. I arrived at my grandma's house at 3:33. She has THREE houses on her block. I went up to the door, which had THREE chips on it, and knocked THREE times. After THREE seconds, she said: "Be right there!"- it had THREE words in it. She came up to the door and took off THREE locks on her door. She invited me into the kitchen for cookies, while all of her THREE cats ran past me, one of which had THREE spots on him. She told me to sit down next to the table, which had THREE chairs. She handed me the platter with THREE cookies on it, and said that her THREE cats took THREE of the cookies THREE times. So we sat down for THREE minutes, and talked about THREE subjects: Major companies, Games, and Numbers. After that, we sat in my grandma's living room, and watched THREE different channels. After a while, she started to get thirsty, so I generously got up from one of the THREE sofas, went into the kitchen, and opened the fridge. I spilled THREE drinks, but I got more for my grandma. When I came back into the room, she was watching a commercial for a product that said: "If you don't get it in THREE days, it's free! Only $33.33!" I sat down and started reading a magazine for children- the THIRD issue. It was on how to add. 1+1-1+1+1=3. That didn't seem appropriate for a children's book, so I went on the computer in my grandma's bedroom, and found out the company had been in buisiness for only THREE years. Now it made sense. It was time for me to leave because I was going to a party with THREE of my friends. My grandma gave me THREE seashells as a present, which I thanked her THREE times for. So then I left out the door, walked to my car, and drove away.\n\n\nSo, what I'm trying to say is that I had a great time at my grandma's house.","June 20, 2015","true","15.1"," 547 of 643 people (85%) found this review helpful 1,047 people found this review funny","85","547","643","047","24"

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Half-Life 2 is a first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve Software (Corporation) and is a sequel to the extremely popular and revolutionary 1998 game Half-Life. Half-Life 2 was originally released back in 2004 and was then boasting the newly developed, highly flexible and powerful Source Engine, it then became an instant classic by making good use of new technology, excellent storytelling, gameplay mechanics and an unrivaled online experience. Alongside its predecessor, both games left a lasting impression, particularly on the FPS genre, as an industry standard for future FPS games to come.\n\nPLOT (No Spoilers):Half-Life 2 puts the player once more behind the thick-framed bulletproof glasses of Gordon Freeman, an MIT Graduate of Theoretical Physics with an uncanny ability to wield military hardware and the person indirectly responsible for opening a portal to an alien world and exposing Earth to an invasion that is to be known as the 'Black Mesa Incident'. Half-Life 2 is set 20 years after the events of Half-Life 1 and the world is now under the full control of the 'Combine', an interdimensional empire that is currently harvesting the natural resources of Earth including the human race which is now close to extinction.\n\nPROS:+ Graphics and artstyle that looks just as good as it is now (2015), as it was eleven years ago (2004).\n+ Excellent sequel with an excellent story that expands the Half-Life Universe\n+ Excellent memorable supporting characters such as Alyx Vance\n+ Great sound quality, facial animation, and voice acting adds to the immersive experience\n+ Excellent enemy AI\n+ Great level and environment designs but...(see CON #1)\n+ Fun gunplay and gameplay mechanics\n+ Good selection of weapons and equipment with very creative special abilities (Gravity Gun)\n+ Atmospheric with excellent use of lighting, sound effects and environment design\n+ Challenging difficulties\n+ Expanded levels that give some room for exploration, but doesn't destroy the narrative storytelling\n+ Lengthy game time\n+ Very affordable price (though I highly recommend the Half-Life Complete pack)\n+ Multiplayer is still active as far as I can tell\n+ Tons of available mods that expand player experience\n\nCONS:- Driving section may be a little too long but it does offer a few 'stops' where the player can stretch his leg muscles and trigger finger.\n- The Squad Support AI is down right suicidal with no command to tell them to stay in place for more than 15 seconds before they follow you again. (This is annoying specially if you're trying to keep them alive against particularly deadly opponents such as Striders)\n- Rag-doll physics engine can be unrealistically (albeit hilariously) glitchy\n- No Steam Workshop Support for the multitude of MODS that are available.\n\nCONCLUSION:Much like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 is a MASTERPIECE of a game and is a MUST BUY and MUST OWN for any fan of the first person genre because how else can you describe a game that is almost 11 years old, yet, can still retain all the fun and excitement of a recently released title.\n\nWORTH IT?:If you decide to purchase and try this game, I do recommend you purchase Half-Life: Complete so you may also avail of the two Episodes that was subsequently released.\n\nFINAL NOTES:Half-Life 2's use of the amazing Source engine reflects on the fact that this game's graphics, despite showing some age, still manages not only to look good, but also to look authentic and atmospheric with its excellent use of sound and music that makes the environment feel alive. Graphics aside, the gameplay has survived for even after a decade and has still not lost its charm. The enemy AI provides an imposing challenge while gunplay and the creative weapons creates one of the most fun and immersive experience you can get on a first-person shooter. Storywise, the Half-Life universe can be considered as one of the most beautifully crafted worlds in gaming history. Half-Life 2 fully emphasizes this point with its amazing and memorable supporting characters that can establish a connection with the player on an emotional level. To recap, Half-Life 2 is the game that once again redefined how modern first-person shooters will be made in the future and remains as the benchmark for good single player FPS gaming experience.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

Doubt it).\nHowever, i noticed the two best games i got on Steam that i havent reviewed yet happen to be the 2 best FPS's of all time, so here's the first review of the two:\n\nHalf Life 2 is the role-model for all FPS games ever made:\nIt "only" has a singleplayer campaign, but its so well done it doesnt need anything else.\n- Graphics-wise, know this: it's a 2004 game, i played it on 2010 and not once did i feel they were outdated (then again, im not one of those who care a lot about technical aspects)\n- Sounds... this is not a type of game where this aspect is very relevant, so i cant recall anything about it really\n- The Story, even though its not the most original or filled with amazing plot twists, it is still compelling and engaging, making you care about its great characters and what happens next\n- Gameplay, there's where this game excels. From the now-classic 'no cutscenes / always in control', to the incredible variety of scenarios in each level, each with its own tone and pace, and jam-packed with (this is my favourite aspect of the game...) UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS - seriously, i can recall more than 10 scenes that i'll probably never forget about this game.\nThe weapons are also great, in quantity, diversity and in the fun-factor. The enemies too are varied enough and provide a reasonable challenge (though an higher difficulty level would be great).\n- The length of the game is also one of the best / longest i've seen in an FPS, though it provides little replay value once finished.\n\nConclusion: Must-play for any gamer out there, to experience a landmark in videogame history, proving again that Valve knows how to make Greatness.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LastGunslinger/recommended/220/","LastGunslinger","The Last Gunslinger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LastGunslinger/","1057 products in account","Half-Life 2 is a BLAST to play. Pretty much everything in the game is interactive. You pick up paint cans with the gravity gun and when the can hits, it splatters the object with paint. It always fun to pick up a saw blade and toss it at a creature splitting it in half. If its there you can almost be assured that it can be used.\n\nThe controls in Half-Life 2 are the exact same as the original Half-Life so veterans will be able to pick up and go very easily. For newcomers to the series the controls are very easy to pick up and very practical. After playing with this control scheme you probably will set all of your FPS games to it.\n\nI played the game in normal difficulty and it was pretty challenging, but not too hard. I found myself reloading a lot, and even after doing parts in the games over and over again I was still having fun trying to pass it, unlike some other games I have tried. Even though you may load a lot I found that ammo was hardly an issue. The supply crates are pretty much random and give you what you need the most. So if you are running low in shotgun shells, the next crate probably will contain some. This is helpful but at times I felt that I had too much ammo.\n\nThe story takes place a number of years after the Black Mesa incident. The G-man awakes you on a train and talks to you for a moment and then vanishes. You soon get off the train and arrive at a place called “City 17”, ran by a dictator figure known as Dr. Breen, your former administrator at Black Mesa. You don't really know why you are there, or how you got there and the Combine roaming around the streets don't seem too friendly. You play through the entire game through Gordon Freeman's eyes really immersing you in the game.\n\nI was always in awe throughout the whole game. This game has the best graphics I have seen on any game. The people look life-like. They display their emotions so well that you know what they are feeling. The buildings and the atmosphere are awe-inspiring. You may never want to leave City 17 after you see its beauty. The different lighting in each area was great. You actually felt like you were progressing through the game when you start out in day time, and soon you see the sun setting and then it gets dark again.\n\nThe music in this game was awesome. You could tell when a big battle was coming because the music would start playing, and your blood would start pumping. The music made the game that much more enjoyable. I listen to the soundtrack and I can see the battles without actually playing the game. That in my opinion is what makes the battles so great.\n\nThe sound in the game was great. I loved the sound the combines made when they died. Each character had a distinct voice and had astounding voice acting. I have never been as freaked in a game when I hear a howl off in the distance and hear a rain gutter banging letting me know that a fast zombie is climbing up after me. The only reason why this score got a 9 is that there is some stuttering when the game loads or auto saves which can be very annoying.\n\nThis game took me more than 20 hours to complete after playing around in the game with the physics and such, so it wasn't that short of a game, especially for an FPS. This game is definitely replayable. After playing through the game I invited my friend over so he could play it. He found different ways to kill creatures and solve puzzles that I never thought of, so that in itself is a great reason to replay the game. Also the game on hard is much more difficult than normal giving you more challenge as you go around a second time. Why an 8 then? Well the multiplayer is non-existent as of right now so I can't see myself playing it as much as I could be.\n\nThis game is the best game this year. The graphics, physics, AI, music and sound strung around a well woven story make for a great time. You should definitely buy this game. If you computer can't handle it then its worth the price of upgrading.\n\n\nReviewer's Score: 10/10 | Originally Posted: 11/22/04","November 25, 2013","true","3.5"," 294 of 331 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","294","331","0","0"

We are coterminous. There is no distance between us. No false veils of time or space may intervene. We see you still in Black Mesa. Clearly we see you in the Nihilanth's chamber. We bear witness to the bright eternity of the Nihilanth's demise. You leap, you fall, we see you flash between the barriers. We are there still, in observance of your final stroke. While our own lay scattered at your feet, you severed the vortal cord that bound the Nihilanth to life, and to us. That sharp spur of hope has not dulled to this day. For once the lesser master lay defeated, we knew the greater must also fall in time.\n\nFor a brief time you joined with us. You are one. Between the worlds. Communion of the Vortessence. And that other: a deeper mystery. No deeper than the void itself. We cannot forget those whose cords you cut. Forgiveness is not ours to bestow. Unity of purpose, the shattering of common shackles, a single road we tread. Your song we sing and shall sing for eternity. No matter the consequences of this struggle. You have brought us grief and jubilation beyond measure. With you beside us, a talisman of victory, the day of freedom draws nigh.\n\nYour bright face obscures your darker mask. We call you sib, although your mind and meaning are a mystery to us. Far distant eyes look out through yours. Something secret steers us both. We shall not name it. We have endured these chafing bonds for eons, yet a single moment of further servitude seems intolerable! How often have we slipped our yoke, only to find it choking us again. Let this war end in either total victory or our extinction. No further compromise shall we allow. We take our stand beside you, here, upon this miserable rock.\n\nThe way ahead is dark for the moment. What seems to you a sacrifice is merely, to us, an oscillation. We do not fear the interval of darkness. We are a tapestry woven of Vortessence. It is the same for you if only you would see it. How many are there in you? Whose hopes and dreams do you encompass? Could you but see the eyes inside your own, the minds in your mind, you would see how much we share.\n\nWe are you, Freeman.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/220/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","(Re-written review)\nHalf-Life 2, an ageless classic of PC games, the title that put Valve on the map, the reason Steam exists today and one of the most ground-breaking titles of it's time. I'm going to say right now to those who haven't played Half-Life 2 to do so immediately, as it is an incredible game that to me has triumphed over the tests of time and remains high on the list of video games that can never be bested.\nHalf-Life 2 is just about perfect in every regard: from it's carefully forged story to the perfected pacing, from unforgettable characters to a steady challenge curve. The entirety of Half-Life 2 is a journey leading the player full circle in their quest to liberate humanity from their omnipresent multidimensional conquerers, the Combine.\nBut if the game wasn't already grand enough, Valve gives the player ultimate control over their physics engine with the highly beloved Gravity Gun (you can call it the Zero-Point Energy Manipulator, if you really want to), a weapon that has never been equaled in any game since. The Gravity Gun allows you to pick up objects from the world, like barrels, sawblades, crates and anything you can move and use them as protection against enemy fire or throw them at your foes in a satisfying method. This is even encouraged by the developers, for the level immediately after you recieve the Gravity Gun you are placed in a zombie-infested town with limited ammo and plenty of sharp, explosive or otherwise deadly-when-hurled-at-100kph objects. In other words: A playground for your new best friend.\nSo if you're a recent gamer looking for a timeless classic or a veteran tired of all the two-weapon inventory crap in modern games, I sincerely and whole-heartedly recommend Half-Life 2 for an experience that has never been topped.","March 21, 2014","true","77.5"," 125 of 133 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","125","133","0","3"

And I have always given up during the first few airboat sections. I thought it was nothing more than a boring shooter and I just couldn't keep myself interested at all. But now, almost 11 years after its initial release, I suddenly decided that it's the right time to give it another chance.\n\nAnd after finishing it I don't regret a single minute.\n\nIt's true, let's face it. The game only truly starts after you get away from that airboat, and then... Pure awesomeness commences. It's so fantastically designed that the gunfights never feel boring, there's one action after another, every single location is filled with its own unique atmosphere and while the story isn't the most creative or breathtaking one, the game more than makes up for it with everything else. It feels so great to play, and you have to play it yourself to really understand.\n\nApplause to Valve and a slap in my face for not playing this masterpiece earlier.

It's probably even the best FPS solo game I've ever played after Portal.\n\nAs usual in Valve games, there is no cutscenes, all events are lived through Gordon's eyes and that's what makes it so immersive.\nThere are some great passages where you really need to search well for an entry, a way out...\nThe game universe is really great even tho the game doesn't explain much about it. (Combine occupation, Gordon's story... etc) That's why you should raelly browse the wiki for more infos.\nMany things remind of portal (the musics) (the citadel, that huuuuge building reminds a lot of portal 2) and the 2 games are even supposed to take place at the same time. (There are some allusions to Black mesa in portal and some allusions of Aperture in HL).\nHowever the game can be a little buggy, and the achievements are bugged as usual in Source games...\n\n\n\nExcellent jeu solo, surtout grace a son super scenar et son coté immersif. C'est meme surement le meilleur FPS solo auquel j'ai joué apres portal.\n\nComme d'hab dans les jeux Valve, pas de cinématiques, on vit tout à travers les yeux de Gordon, et c'est ce qui rend le jeu si immersif.\nIl y a de bons passages ou il faut bien chercher pour une sortie, une entrée... etc.\nL'univers du jeu est vraiment enorme meme si le jeu n'explique que peu de choses dessus (l'occupation Combine, l'histoire de Gordon...etc ) c'est pourquoi ca vaut vraiment le coup de jeter un oeil au wiki.\nBeacoup de choses rappelent Portal (la musique, l'ambiance sur les bords) (le citadelle, qui rappele portal 2) et les 2 jeux se passent meme en meme temps, dans le meme univers (il y a des  allusions à Black Mesa dans Portal et des allusions à Aperture dans HL)\nSeul défauts le jeu bug un peu et les succés eux buggent aussi pas mal, comme d'habitude dans les jeux source.\n\n\n\n","January 15, 2014","true","28.4"," 88 of 93 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","88","93","0","2"

In that time, Valve created their own game engine, known as Source, and with the Gravity Gun quickly became THE game to copy.  Like ClassicDOOM before it, most FPS games that came after Half-Life 2 valiantly attempted to copy the in-game physics engine that allows to to catch and repel in-game props.  Many of them succeeded, but Half-Life 2 was the first to do it, and gamers know where to give credit where credit is due.\n\nOnce again, you play as Gordon Freeman, mute savior of humankind.  Reawakened by the G-Man from the previous game "some time later," you find that the world as you know it is no longer.  The Combine have successfully invaded and subjuated humanity, and it's only a matter of time before Man becomes just another X-stamp on the Combine's evolutionary whiteboard.  Unless you can rise up to the challenge of liberating your very species, that time will approach far quicker than you'd like.\n\nOne of the first FPS games to introduce drivable vehicles, adding the Gravity Gun is just icing on this cake (that's a metaphor, not a lie).  Chock full of references and easter-eggs, Valve should be proud that their title has continued to successfully carry the FPS banner.","January 5, 2015","true","25.1"," 80 of 86 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","80","86","10","3"

The layout of this game is tremendous diverse locations and fun firefights.  For many, including myself getting this game meant - getting STEAM? - what was it, how will it work and such.  At the time Steam was a bit buggy and had some issues but that was 10+ years ago and look at it now... its come a long way.  Half Life for me is almost like a bad habit I keep going back to after 16 years of playing HL and 10 years of HL2 I always go back for another run - because there fun!  Why are they fun - its a unique world, decent graphics (top of the line when released), awesome game play, good AI, Killer music and soundtracks, fun characters and the MOD options.\n\nMy favorite levels in the game are Nova Prospect & Ravenholm... 2 fantastic levels.  Headcrab zombies and poison crabs - suck especially the poison crabs they make my hair stand up and the sound they make - (girly scream).\n\nI am all about Half Life again after my mini rant earlier in the week and the somewhat troublesome news from Valve regarding HL3 - please see the rant in the activity feed.\n\nVALVE CAN NEVER LET THIS GAME END WITH OUT A PROPER FOLLOW UP AND EXPLANATION OF THE MANY LOOSE ENDS AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE QUESTION - JUST WHO EXACTLY IS THE GMAN AND WHY IS HE PORTRAYED THE WAY HE IS?\n\nRecommended game if your the one person out there that has not played it yet, lol.","September 25, 2014","true","19.2"," 58 of 61 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","58","61","0","2"

He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went.\nJohn Freeman got his computer shut down and wet on the platform to go up to the roof of the building where he left his motorcycle and normal people close because he was in his office lab coat. John Freeman got on his motorcycl and said "its time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences" so he had to go.\nJohn Freeman ramped off the building and did a backflip and landed. He kept driving down the road and made sure there was no zombies around because he ddint have weapon.\nThe contrysides were nice and the plants were singing and the birds and the sun was almost down from the top of the sky. the mood was set for John Freemans quest to help his brother where he was. John Freeman looked around the countrysides and said "its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys".\nJohn Freeman was late so he had to drive really fast. A cop car was hiden near by so when John Freeman went by the cops came and wanted to give him a ticket. Here John Freeman saw the first monster because the cop was posessed and had headcrabs.\n"I cant give you my lisense officer" John Freeman said\n"Why not?" said the headcrab oficer back to John Freeman.\n"Because you are headcrab zombie" so John Freeman shot the oficer in the head and drove off thinking "my brother is in trouble there" and went faster.\nJohn Freeman had to go faster like the speed of sound and got there fast because Gordon needed him where he was. John Freeman looked at road signs and saw "Ravenholm" with someons writing under it saying "u shudnt come here" so John Freeman almost turned around but heard screaming like Gordon so he went faster again.\nJohn Freeman drove in and did another flip n jumped off his motorbike and the motor bike took out some headcrab zombies infront of John Freeman. John Freeman smiled and walked fast. John Freeman then looked on the ground and found wepon so he pickd it up and fired fast at zombie goasts in front of a house.\nJohn Freeman said "Zombie goasts leave this place" and the zombie goasts said "but this is our house" and John Freeman felt sorry for them becaus they couldnt live there anymore because they were zombie goasts so he blew up the house and killed the zombie goasts so they were at piece.\nThen John Freeman herd another scream from his brother so he kept walking really faster to get where he was. Ravenholdm was nothing like the countrysides there was no birds singing and the pants were dead and teh dirt was messy and bloody from headcrabs.\nWhen John Freeman got to where the screaming was started from he found his brother Gorden Freeman fightin the final bosss and Gordon said "John Freeman! Over here!" so John Freeman went there to where Gordon Freeman was fighting. John Freeman fired his bullet from teh gun really fast and the bullets went and shot the final boss in the eyes and the final boss couldnt see.\nGordon Freeman said "its time to end this ones and for all!" and punched the final boss in the face and the final boss fell. John Freeman said "thanks i could help, bro" and Gordon Freeman said "you should come here earlier next time" and they laughed.\nThe laughed overed quickly though because John Freeman yelled "LOOK OUT BRO!" and pointed up to the top of the sky. Gordon Freeman looked up and said "NOO! John Freeman run out of here fast as you can!" and John Freeman walked real fast out.\nJohn Freeman loked back and saw Gordon get steppd on by the next boss and he was mad and angry.\n"I'll get you back evil boss!"

For starters you have the basic weapons, pistols, machine guns, a shotgun, grenades, rocket launcher (RPG?) and so on. Some weapons have dual uses like the machine gun has a grenade launcher. The weapons feel very good to use. The pistol has never been so much fun to shoot wow! I'm shocked. The machine guns have real kick to them. The shotgun seems very effective. The rocket launcher is laser guided, which is fun to take down helicopters with. Launch it and guide it to the helicopter, because if you shoot it straight, the rocket will get shot down.\n\nThe combat is rich and fulfilling with certain segments of driving such as a boat or car segment where you still get out and go into buildings to combat things. There are also puzzles and challenges to breakup the action just like there were with the original game. It keeps you thinking, sometimes over thinking. There are puzzles such as using a crane to move your car, using a washing machine to weigh down a platform and taking out a force field by rolling a car (trying not to spoil). There are less puzzles in this game than the last, most of the puzzles seem to involve combat like using the gravity gun as a weapon.\n\nLevel design is well thought out. Areas are very realistic and cluttered with things you'd really find in any given area. There are trees, junk, wrecked cars, beds, dilapidated walls, broken floors and so on. It really helps the immersion that these areas feel real instead of a typical video game level. This is a very linear game that does have little points of exploration, but you are cleverly guided through things that catch your eye. Like lights in a room are turned on or a character standing under a light and the game will condition you to subtle cues that they mean "go here" or characters will flat out say "run Gordon! Go now I'll hold them off."\n\nThe game has several new or altered enemies. Even the old enemies are more difficult and altered. There are new head crabs, the standard and the venomous kind. For humans that have a head crab on them, they are this game's zombies, smart, difficult, dangerous zombies. You can shoot them in the head, slice them in half, sometimes the head crab will hop off, they scream a horrifying muffled wail, but worst of all... if you don't get moving they will rise again in a matter of minutes. There are several terrifying enemies that with the dark and new lighting really disturbs you and sends a dread through you that other games fail to duplicate. The game really manages to terrify you through other ways, such as traveling beneath a giant bridge actually gives you a sense of height that is strangely intense because you fear falling when clearly this is a video game. Maybe that says something about the game's immersion.\n\nOf course there are your run of the mill soldiers, and special ops enemies... but they are intelligent. Several enemies in the game are very intelligent and don't have patterns, but thought processes. Such as if they are injured, they will fall back and get a better position, if they have you pinned down, they will throw in grenades, rush in with guns blazing or bait you into firing at them. They will never line up to be shot; they will fan out so they can all shoot you.\n\nIn all the game is a lot of fun, but a lot of it isn't, especially if you're a little clueless as to what the story is, because the game won't help you with that right away at least. What might be an intense boat segment of the game might be a long annoyance for some people. Sometimes you can over think puzzles that aren't even really puzzles, but you miss a small lock to shoot off something and end up using the newly acquired gravity gun to pile junk to get over things. What could be a fun car segment with stops in between could be seen as an annoyance to have to stop, because the military has ambushed you or set up a force field.","July 9, 2013","true","22.2"," 61 of 74 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","61","74","0","0"

I loved Opposing Forces  even more, and Half-Life 2 overall was even better, with some parts of the game not being that good. At the time of writing this review I haven't played the Episodes, so I don't really know info about them.\nThe game starts with GMan telling you that there's stuff to do, and driven by free choice Gordon Freeman does whatever he wants, as long as he follows the corridor the game opens to him. Jokes aside, the game is a huge and long corridor. A very pretty and well done, well built corridor, but still, the game lacks choice and freedom - though it's not really a problem, as the game is action-driven, always happens something that forces you to go further. Attack from beind, tunnels collapsing, or they say the next goal is ahead of you.\nAnd here's where one of the things come in the picture that made the game sooo much better for me that HL1 was - change of environment.  HL1 was in Black Mesa and in Xen, and while the two was vastly different, and the level design was great, you still spent most of your time between walls of BM.  On the other hand in HL 2 there are canals, sewers, city landscape, country-like environment, beach, cliffs, a mining town worthy of horror stories, Combine (aliens) base, and street warfare. Not only the level layout changed, but the style as well. Cities had snipers, zombies and headcrabs were abundant in abandoned places, while combine had most power in the city.  So type of the enemies, coupled with the different environments and available weapons at that point made the game really diverse, while it was really consistent, logical by building up that diversity.\nThings I loved it in game:\n- Finally a proper story with recurring characters, and not just random people telling me where to go and never seeing them again.  Actually the story was really enjoyable.\n- Good weapon selection - they are different, and I think all weapons were useful in certain situations. While one can have a favourite weapon, there wasn't useless ones.\n- Physics are just awesome. The ragdoll after hitting enemies with the crossbow, how explosions throw stuff around, and how *incredibly* well the gravity gun was implemented in the game. The gravity gun is basically a tech bragging from Valve to show off the physics, but instead of it being a show-weapon, they made lots and lots of situations where it was needed. In modern games a lots of new things are used only for a short period, here the Gravity Gun, the driveable buggy and airboat was used for quite a lot of time, G.G. for the most obviously\n- Secrets, AKA Lambda-locations. They are not really useful if you're at least average with FPS games, as they only give ammo, health and ocassionally shields, but they balance out the game for people who are not too good at FPS, but pay attention to their surroundings. I personally love it when a game rewards you for discovery.\n\nAnd the negative:\n- Basically character collision. I finally meet Eli and Alyx, I'm just standing, staring at them talking and then Alyx just pushes me away. In SO MANY scripted moments they just push me away instead of properly avoiding me, and it was really, really annoying and immersion breaking.\n-Character collision 2.0:  you and your squad.  I demand the rights to shoot those terrible soldiers who block eachother and me - they follow me, staying behind like 3-5 metres, and any time I have to go back they bump to me, to eachother, they pushes eachother away like domino pieces, and it's just superfun when a strider is shooting at me.\n-Preposition? The game's start is really weird in my opinion. Climbing though a fence, going in a random house, then getting chased because... why? The game tries to show the Combine bad, so the player would rather flee from them (as lack of means to fight back) but in the game it's not even explained why they are there, and who they are. Which is really weird for me, and made me question the actions and happenings in the first few chapters.\nThese are the only things I can't even grasp how they managed to leave in the game, I can't recall anything else more than mildly annoying.\nGame is still a lot of fun today, and playing it absolutely made me realize how incredily powerful and useful the engine is, and why there are so many mods based on it - the game is fun:  varied enemies and weapons, there are often some mini-puzzles to solve to go further (like collecting 3 car batteries) make the game still a really enjoyable experience. I would recommend playing it if you want a better gameplay experience than a story  - the story is full with mysteries, but playing the game feels much more rewarding than most newer FPS games proved to be for me.","February 1","true","39.4"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","35","38","0","0"

If you haven't played it already then you should, it holds up well against recent titles and embarrasses a fair few.\n\nThe game has so many little touches that make it better than its competitors. The shotgun has a tight blast radius, so it's effective even at considerable distances. The gravity gun gave meaning to the rubbish strewn across the levels. Who would have thought a radiator could serve as a weapon, a shield and a useful platform to reach high-up areas? The grenades are satisfyingly clunky, the explosive barrels are meaty and I wish that they sold bugbait stress balls. It's probably the nicest sounding weapon in the world (and beyond).\n\nThis game needs no introduction. It's the game that single-handedly brought Steam onto desktop PCs everywhere. It had to live up to the standards set by the original and it surpassed it in every way. Graphically it was ahead of its time, with detailed character animations and convincing CLUTTER all over the world. Each level leads straight on from the previous so you can almost draw a mental map of City 17 as you journey towards the looming Citadel in the centre. You can see the sun slowly setting as the levels progress and distant sirens and explosions really draw you into the Eastern-European themed city. There's something very lonely about the echo of a gun shot on the cliff levels.\n\nEvery chapter has its own theme and alterations to the gameplay. You'll find yourself in vehicles, or battling against a certain type of enemy, or battling WITH that type of enemy against another sort. It really makes me wonder why other developers bother even trying to compete with the creativity that this title offers.\n\nIs it perfect? Nhggghhh, almost. I could say that the vehicle sections go on for a bit too long and the quiet, talky sections (which used to be my favourite- LOOK AT THEIR FACES!) have aged a bit. I find myself hitting things with a crowbar, waiting for more enemies to kill.\n\nSeriously, if you don't enjoy this game then first person shooters aren't for you.","December 7, 2013","true","896.2"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","25","26","0","3"

The game was made in 2004 and the graphics still hold up to this very day. The soundtrack is made up of several electronic and ambient songs, all of which were masterfully composed by Kelly Bailey.

In fact so much has been said that it feels redundant just talking about it. Yeah we all know the games amazing story, and the tight controls, and stunning graphics. I mean JESUS look at those graphics! But what really makes HL2 great, besides just the stuff mentioned? We know its the shining crown jewel of gaming, but do we really know why? The short of it is that the game is extremely solid on all fronts, something that truly can't be said about many games. Everything flows, in a way that AAA games still can't come close to, so much to an extent that I feel people sell Half-Life 2 short, even the people prasing it. Sure games today are made for a wider audience and they get that with shiny graphics and a more streamlined cinematic experience. The games are easier because they don't strive to highlight certain mechanics and instead focus on a wide apeal-story based narrative that can be experienced by everyone. But is that really the case? Truly think about it. HL2 doesn't need to pull you out of the world you have been experiencing in first person to show you a cutscene or have the "tutorial guy" , you never follow a map marker or preform a one button stealth takedown. Were made to think AAAs today are much better because theres more there, bigger maps, better graphics, and new toys all come with having as much cash that the companies making these games are willing to pump into them. We feel a sense of evolution that comes with the silver wraping under the christmas tree and are ready to easily consume more and more of the worlds were presented with because everything is made for that reason only. On the contrary Half-Life 2 did something more. The world is experienced by the player. The story is subtle and it only unwraps itself as you peel back the layers of the Half-Life world and see what Gordon Freeman, or you the player, has missed in the last 20 years. Half-life 2's story has a dark tone, with creative interiors and exteriors that never stray from the world being presented to you, refusing to abandon the lore of the world or dampen the experience all while flowing perfectly with gameplay and mechanics. The basics of Half-Life were run and shoot. And they sure as hell kept true to that in HL which is why the game is still so critically acclaimed. And HL2 does this but even better. Its a game truly worth of a sequel, being able to take what the predecessor had done and improving on every way while making each aspect better. The world you run and shoot in is the same world you live in. What AAA games take the time to truly accomplish the blending of the main concept of their game with every other aspect or even use it as one of their misguided selling points? The game Half-Life 2 truly speaks for itself in many ways. Once you have heard one person say it you have probably heard it all. And while we might not have listened well enough for this message to rub off on other games, the effects of HL2 will be felt by those who truly look for a reason to love it.","April 9","true","44.7"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","1"

He eludes the Combine forces and meets Alyx and Barney,and joins the Lambda Resistance.  He gets to Dr. Kleiner's lab and assists them in attempting to get a teleporter to teleport him and Alyx to Dr. Eli Vance's lab. The teleportation fails,and he goes through City 17 on foot to get to Eli's lab.  He arrives at Black Mesa East and meets up with Eli, where he is captured and taken to a combine prison,Nova Prospekt.  Gordon goes through a zombie infested town named Ravenholm and is given a Dune Buggy,which he uses to travel to Nova Prospekt.  Eli,Alyx,and Gordon escape,the combine teleporter they used exploding in the process.  Gordon and Alyx learn they were in a "slow teleport"during which a week has passed. In their absence,the Resistance mobilized against the combine, turning City 17 into a battleground.  Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel,with Gordon,aided by Barney and D0g,goes to the Citadel.  He gets caught in a Combine"confiscation chamber",which destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun,the energy enhancing it's capabilities and turning it into a superior weapon.  He is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office,where he is holding Eli and Alyx captive.  Breen explains his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine.  Breen tries to escape through a portal,but Gordon destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen is annihilated in the resulting explosion,but just before Gordon and Alyx get killed,time is frozen,and the G-Man appears,praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel,and puts Gordon back into stasis.\n\nThe characters are pretty cool,even if some of the characters can tend to be annoying*looks at Barney*\n\nThe music is pretty cool,tho the game mostly relies on ambiance.\n\nThe weapons are pretty good,just really your standard FPS weapons,except the Gravity Gun is added,which lets you move almost any object at will. Heck,you get a crowbar also x) :)\n\nThis is an amazing game overall,it seriously deserves the critical acclaim that it's gotten,and I HIGHLY recommend this game,even to those that haven't played Half-Life before,it's def worth the 10 bucks\n10/10 from me :)","October 11, 2014","true","27.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

With that being said, it is still a fairly wonderful game.  The dystopian setting is extremely enjoyable, with levels of dry humor that keep you interested.  The game mechanics are similar to the rest of Valve's collection, so you know what to expect.  Quirky additions are what set the game apart--such as the gravity gun and vehicles.

I have yet to play the next two episodes that branch off from this game.\n\nOverview Half-Life 2 is hands down the best linearly crafted game I have ever played. Every aspect of this masterpiece has been perfected by the developers, and I really can't stress how well it all comes together. In this review I will go over Half-Life 2's graphics/performance, gameplay, story, and some closing thoughts in order to break down its flawlessness.\n\nWake up Mr. Freeman, wake up and smell the ashes.\n\nGraphics/Performance It may be just over a decade old, but Half-Life 2 is still a seriously beautiful game. From the textures to the physics, all was designed to the highest fidelity that could possibly be achieved in those times, and then some. The visuals were so ahead of their time in fact, it took another 3 years for any game to catch up to Half-Life 2's graphical prowess, which was the first Crysis game. I really can't see how anyone, even today, can truthfully say Half-Life 2 is outdated aesthetically speaking. Crank all the video settings to max, play in 1080p, easily get 60fps+ and you're in for a scenic experience through a wonderful game. Now, on with the performance. Much like all other games based on the source engine, Half-Life 2 runs with barely a single deficiency. The only problem that arose for me while playing through the games campaign was a recurring crash at a particular point in the chapter: "Follow Freeman!" I had a save about 10 seconds before the crash, and there was nothing I could do to prevent it from happening shortly after loading it. I ended up having to resort to a save from 10 minutes before, and upon arriving at that point in the game again, there was no crash. I really have no guess as to why the game was failing, other than maybe something specifically hectic that may have been going on at the time, which the games engine couldn't handle. Other than this small instance, the visuals and performance of Half-Life 2 are near faultless.\n\nGameplay Much like the previous entry in the Half-Life franchise, the gameplay is what it's really all about. Whether you're shooting down the remnants of the Xen forces, overtaking the Combine, driving a scout car through the breathtaking coast, or commanding an army of Antlions, you're sure to have fun with whatever you're doing in Half-Life 2. Throughout the campaign you'll gather an arsenal of weapons in order to wage visceral and tactical combat against your foes. Due to this, there are plenty of ways to take down your adversaries. The game also shows it's variety in battle through the perfectly paced and skill-taxing boss battles. They always occur at just the right time to catch you off guard, and always really test you no matter the difficulty at which you play. The last great aspect of Half-Life 2's action happens near the end game when you get a squad of fighters to accompany you. There isn't all that much you can do command them other than telling them where they go, but they do offer more full-on warlike action in certain scenes of the game, rather than you being the sole warrior against an entire army. Other than combat, there's also a bit of puzzling and platforming to do, which is all done very well. This wall of text may not do it justice, but all considered the gameplay of Half-Life 2 is quite glorious.\n\nStory Half-Life 2 carries on the story of the original, with some genuinely confusing twists and turns. You are still Gordon Freeman, and have been reassigned to action by the mysterious G-Man to continue your fight to save humanity. Since Black Mesa you have become something of a hero to the human race, who are in dire need of one. Anywhere from 10-20 years after the original is when Half-Life 2 takes place, and since then Earth has been taken over by a masked race of aliens known only as the Combine. During this invasion, Gordon was still in the G-Man's purgatory, so we are unsure how it all went down. They have essentially enslaved humanity, and there is next to no hope left in the world. That is, until the return of Gordon Freeman. You'll meet up with a few characters shortly after the game begins, some of which you already know from the original game, and some of whom are new. What connects you all the most, however, is your ongoing effort to overthrow the Combine and regaining the Earth once again so that all humans can live freely. They are also all connected by being great characters, but that's beside the point. This may all sound somewhat spoilery, but all of what I've just described occurs in the first 30 minutes, so don't worry. To sum up, Half-Life 2 is a continuation of the already complicated original Half-Life, which just adds to the mind bending confusion and interesting narrative when all is said and done.\n\nFinal Thoughts Half-Life 2 is a classic just like the original that came before it. Throughout the games 11-13 hour campaign, I've fallen even more madly in love with this series. I still have a little bit more content from Half-Life 2 to play via episode 1 and 2, but I now deeply fear the crushing depression that others have felt for years in wait of Half-Life 3. So Valve, do me a favor and announce it shortly after I complete episode 2, alright? This franchise is just ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic and we all deserve more. Now please, everyone who is even remotely entertained by the FPS genre, play this game if you somehow haven't already. I can't believe I allowed myself to be so late to the party. This game is truly pure gaming gold in every sense of the words.\n\nPersonal Rating: 10/10","May 1","true","12.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDoctor-DW/recommended/220/","TheDoctor-DW","Doctor \\ Who","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDoctor-DW/","77 products in account","Half-Life 2 is an amazing game.\n\nHalf-Life 2's level design is really good and does a good job at letting you be in a confined space but not letting you feel trapped. It feels authentic in a sense that, if you're in a specific level, you're trapped by actual walls or solid and visible objects; as opposed to invisible objects. Some would think that it might have invisible walls with a futuristic touch, like blue lines going through it, since it is a Sci-Fi game.\n\nHalf-Life 2 also does an excellent job and making you feel scared. There is one level, Ravenholm, it is absolutely filled with zombies, it is a very dark and eerie level. I remember, the entire time I was playing through it, I was extremely terrified, but had to power through. It was hard.\n\nHalf-Life 2's combat is pretty spot on, almost no errors anywhere with hitboxes being fine and no noticeable or game-breaking bugs. The game also has a variety of weapons.\n\nHalf-Life 2 lets you drive 2 vehicles in the game, one of which is a Jeep, it is a very fast land-vehicle. It is mildly difficult to control while at high speeds, which isn't a bad thing, it's to be expected. The Airboat is a fast land and water vehicle which is noticeably difficult to control, at almost any time. The game has a good sue of vehicles in specific levels.\n\nHalf-Life 2's soundtrack and sounds do sound very modern. The soundtrack is extremely good, and chooses what to play at specific times, but even so, the music it does actually play is very good. Even now, while writing this review, I am listening to part of the soundtrack, Triage at Dawn, it is called. A very, very nice part of the soundtrack. The sounds, even crowbarring a toilet or a wall, do sound very real.\n\nThe game, I should talk about, doesn't, for me, at least, do an excellent job at keeping you hooked, it took me a while in between play-sessions to get back into it. But I very recently finished it.\n\nThis all makes out to be a very pleasant gaming experience, and it is highly recommended as a game.\n91/100","September 25, 2014","true","13.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecrazyscotsman/recommended/220/","thecrazyscotsman","thecrazyscotsman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecrazyscotsman/","255 products in account","Let's get this out of the way: the Source engine is showing its age – later Valve games have incorporated upgrades that are lacking in Half-Life 2. There isn’t much detail compared to more recent games, textures are blurry, and there are problems with lighting and shadows. All of that is true, but it really isn’t fair to criticize the game for that…it was made in 2004, and it looks like it was, but that doesn’t take away from how fun it is to play. And besides, if you’re really concerned about the graphics, you can always download one of the free community mods (Half-Life 2: Update for example) which make it look prettier.\n\nOn to my thoughts on the gameplay. I think the reason Half-Life 2 was (and still is) so successful is because the gameplay constantly evolves as you progress forward. As soon as you become comfortable, you’re presented with something which changes how you can approach each situation. After playing the beginning – which feels like a fairly standard shooter – you’re given the airboat and giant arenas to play around with. After a while of that, they give you a machine gun on the airboat, changing up how you use it. Then you’re given the gravity gun, and immediately thrust into Ravenholm, a haunting and creepy environment filled with saw blades, barrels, and other things you can throw at enemies. Then comes the dune buggy and ant-lions, and some of my favorite sections of the game. Traveling down Highway 17, dodging ant-lions as you ferret out combine strongholds on the coast, showcases some of the best that Half-Life 2 has to offer.\n\nBut the game isn’t done throwing new things at you. After fighting the ant-lions, you’re given a tool which makes them your allies, and you use them to assault Nova Prospekt, a claustrophobic prison where you’re given access to automated turrets and have to stand your ground against waves of Combine soldiers. Once you’ve escaped Nova Prospekt, you’re thrown into a full-blown rebellion and given command of a squad of resistance fighters. And then finally, at the end of the game, all of your weapons are taken away except for a super-powered gravity gun, and you get to experience what it’s like to throw men around like rag dolls as you rampage through the citadel.\n\nNot all of these are executed perfectly – the squad command sections in particular hilariously showcase the shortcomings of the AI, with companions constantly getting in your way, running out to die from snipers or grenades, and generally acting like morons. Some of the pacing, particularly at the beginning of the game as you run through sewer after sewer and later as you crawl through Nova Prospekt, is tedious and repetitive. But it’s worth playing through those sections to see what comes next, because there’s always something new around the corner.\n\nHalf-Life 2 still does a far better job than most recent games in shifting the game’s paradigm constantly, and that evolving gameplay makes it successful – and fun to play over a decade later. If it’s been a while since you played it, it’s worth it to revisit it. If you’ve never played it before, it won’t wow you with its looks, but you’ll experience a classic with some of the best gameplay around – and widely considered one of the best games ever made.\n\nView the full review here[www.thesewall.com].","February 22","true","20.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

After that, you can wait until Half-Life 3 comes out!","February 9, 2014","true","19.6"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","4"

I still get surprised whenever I come across someone who spends a lot of time playing games, but hasn't finished (or even played) Half-Life 2.\n\nThe story telling in this game is fantastic. The story, characters and levels are well developed and it's clear just how much time went into making the game. I love all the detail put into level design, character development and design, and voice acting.\n\nSome people think the graphics are a little dated, which is true. It's a game from 2004. But if anything, I think it adds to the feel of the game. Additionally, what game will never have it's graphics dated? Technology changes people, gosh.\n\nIf you have Half-Life 2 in your steam library but haven't yet played or are yet to acquire a copy, I strongly recommend giving it a shot. You won't regret it. You'd better be quick though, you'd want to finish it before Half-Life 3 is released!\n\nAnd of course you've gotta love some ABHing, wall climbing and grenade jumping while speedrunning!\n\nSuper highly recommended!\nHappy Life Halving!","April 17, 2014","true","157.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Ho impiegato 4 giorni a finirlo, contro il mese impiegato 10 anni fa. Questo mi rassicura non poco riguardo alla mia memoria e capacità di apprendimento, evidentemente non ancora del tutto devastate dall'età... Il gioco si presenta ancora molto bene, e quando si inizia è difficile smettere (un po' come con le sigarette). Certo lo stupore provato la prima volta, per la grafica, la fisica e il gameplay oggi non c'è più, ma il divertimento è comunque ancora assicurato. I percorsi obbligati, gli enigmi mai troppo complicati e le ottime possibilità di salvataggio rendono il gioco sempre scorrevole e mai frustrante. L'HDR ha reso la grafica ancora più realistica (per un gioco di 10 anni fa, ovviamente). Un po' lenti i caricamenti, e i salvataggi  causano spesso momentanei inceppamenti, particolarmente fastidiosi a livello audio.\nResta in ogni caso un gioco fondamentale, una vera pietra miliare da non perdere assolutamente.\n\nI replayed HL2 after 10 years. It took me four days to finish it, against the month took 10 years ago. That reassures me more than a little about my memory and learning ability, apparently not yet completely devastated by age ... The game is still very good, and when you start it is hard to stop (a bit like with cigarettes). Certainly the astonishment felt the first time, for graphics, physics and gameplay today is no more, but the fun is still yet assured. The obligatory paths, the puzzles never too complicated and very good chances of saving make the game always smooth and never frustrating. The HDR made even more realistic graphics (for a ten years old game, of course). A little slow the loadings, and saving often produced momentary jamming, particularly annoying to hear.\nIt is in any case a crucial game, a milestone not to be missed.","January 15, 2015","true","54.8"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","23","36","8","2"

If the statement is not clear enough, 1 can be 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 etc but that those numbers were rounded into 1 (only works when counting things in real life, not math questions unless coma ( , ) is included)\nSo imagine you deround 1+1 for example 1.4+1.3= 2.7 and now round the result into 3 and there you have it 1+1=3\n\nand what does these have to do with Half-Life in the first place? First, calculate the average playtime of every Half-Life players to finish the game (around 10+ hours) the first half-life cost 10 bucks, while games with the cost of 10 bucks these days only worth 8+ hours of gametime (replay value not included) so you can say that the first half-life and the second are worth 1.2 more than average 10 bucks game. which equals to 2.4. And the we include the the two bonus episodes which is cost more than 10 bucks if combined and let's just say it's worth 8+ hours of gametime. Include that and the whole Half-Life series is worth 3.4 and I round it to 3.\n\nSo the conclusion, why half-life 3 won't  release, because the whole series is already worth more with or without Half-Life 3. The whole series is a big 3 itself.\n\nthank you for reading, If you like my theory, please share it with your fellow friends so they'll know.","February 11","true","5.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","9","10","6","1"

There are a wide variety of weapons to use, along with well hidden lambda caches to find and use to your advantege as you battle through City 17 and through the outskirts.\n\nHowever, I don't think Half Life 2 is as amazing as most people claim it to be. "10/10. 11/10. Best game ever!" It kinda makes me laugh...\nWith Half Life 2 being a very solid shooter. I find It difficult to follow the story, or figure out why these events in the game are happening; It feeels like it's out of nowhere. For example: The Combine. They are not in the original Half Life. All that's explained is they are this Inter dimensional organization That wants to enslave Humanity, and you have to fight them.\nSequel bait endings are the least of satisfying endings ever, and this game has that.\n\nI rate Half Life 2 with a solid 8/10. When this game goes on sale, definitely pick it up. I got the Half Life Collection for about $5.00\n\nThat's my review for Half Life 2 and I will see you on the next one.

This has to be one of the greatest games of 2004 and maybe even one of the best of the decade and that's why I would give this a 10/10. The level designs are certainly nowhere near linear, and the combat feels just swell. The characters and the voice acting can't seem to make me yawn or flinch a bit and I can't seem to stop playing every little second of the way. The only issue I have with this game are the friendly AI helpers. They just seem to get in the way and it might get you killed and it will bother anyone. Another extremely minor issue that won't bother anyone is that I think that Canals carrys on for too damn long. Still a great game and I always tell dog when whenever to wake up "Rise and Shine, mister Freeman!".

John Freeman jumped fast off the motorcycle and landed on dead peoples hands.\n\n"Gordon Freeman is now these hands... i must kill the next boss and live up to full-life consequences!" John Freeman said out loud.\n\nJohn Freeman picked up a laser gun and aimed it at trees to see if he could. John Freeman shot and tree fell down in front of him. John Freeman seen eggs fall out of the tree and he put them back home safe.\n\n"These birds dont have to see Gordon Freeman yet. its not time." John Freeman said to him.\n\nJohn Freeman had to walked faster and was back at his office work and on a computer. He looked on the internet and found the next boss.\n\n"I know his weakness now" John Freeman said. And after that he got emails from someone. John Freeman opened up the emails and read them.\n\n"Dear John Freeman, how are you? I miss you at home come home safe and soon with Gordon Freeman for thanksgiving dinner. Love mom." John Freeman looked at it and got sad and yelled "I WILL KILL THE BOSS AND GORDON FREEMAN WILL BE HAPPY SOUL!" then he turned on off the computer and wet on the platform again down to his other more faster motorcycle that had gas in it this time.\n\nJohn Freeman put the laser gun on his motorcycle and his machine gun and his rocket gun that he found on the side of the motorcycle. He went through traffic and went fast like litning to back to Ravenholm and back to the bad place where Gordon Freeman was. John Freeman went off road and did backflips and landed on back wheels but kept going too.\n\nJohn Freeman went really fast again like before and was soon back again at Ravenholm but saw more zombie goasts. John Freeman said to them "Zombie goasts i have killed your friends at the old house and i dont want to shoot your heads. move near the countrysides and you will be friends of John Freeman." The zombie goasts said that "no we will kill you" and walked fast to John Freemans motorcycle. John Freeman waited until they were in front of his motorcycle and backflipped off his bars and shot heads below and landed and walked fast to where the next boss was.\n\n"you will be one of us!" yelled the dead zombie goasts. John Freeman laughed and shot a rocket at them.\n\nJohn Freeman saw the next boss far down the road and walked slow this time. He walked really slow like a turtle and sat down on a rock and watched the next boss near the dead last boss and where the place that Gordon Freeman was. The next boss was laughing at John Freeman so John Freeman said "YOU WILL NOT LAUGH AT ME!" and shot a rocket at him since that was his weakness.\n\nThe next boss died and John Freeman was happy. He walked over to the dead bosses and put them under the ground and planted pants on them so instead of messy dirt and dark there was pretty things there now to be happy.\n\nJohn Freeman walked to where Gordon Freeman was lying dead and crushed from the next bosss feet and looked down. A tear droped out of John Freemans eye and landed on Gordon Freeman.\n\n"You are dead bro and i killed the evil boss." John Freeman told Gordon Freeman\n\nThen John Freeman saw something bad. A headcrab was on Gordon Freeman!

As i said Half Life revolutionized the FPS genre. Both story wise and gameplay wise. They were the first to do what others dared not to. And guess what? They done it again with it's sequal.\n\nHalf Life 2's budget consisted out of $40,000,000. What's revolutionary about this game is the source engine. It provided realistic physics and facial animations.\n\nStory\nIn the first game a portal opens up from a planet named Xen. You end up destroying the Queen, thus braking the portal link and ending up in captivity of Gman. The events of Half Life 2 happen 20 years after Half Life 1, somewhere in a eastern Europe town called City 17. Human race got enslaved by Combine, an alien race that was in war with Xen, which got interested in Earth after the events of Half Life 1. Gman decides to send you to City 17 to help the resistance.\nThe realistic facial animations, and graphics in general that source engine provided really add up to the experience. The character really come to life thanks to those facial animations. The game was also filled with action packed cinematic set pieces, as well as unique levels. A zombie town for example. Or a land with arachnid creatures coming out of the sand. The boat chase. Or the one where you have to use the crane to get you car to the other side of the gate. And that final level. Once again, there was no game like it. They were the first to do it.\nBack then COD didn't have nukes. There was no David Cage's Fahrenheit/Heavy Rain, or Naughty Dogs's Uncharted/Last of Us. No Telltale's Walking Dead or L.A. Noire. So "Bravo!" to Valve.\n\n\nGameplay\nThanks to the physics that source provided, the new thing about this game is the gravity gun, which lets you pick up and throw objects. You can pick up sharp objects and cut enemies in half. Or use explosive barrels to lite them up. Or simply smash them with something heavy. Or say to throw back a grenade.\nThere are also new enemy types. New headscarb types were added. There are ones that are poisonois. When encountering a zombie like that, he will have like ~5 of them on his back and will be throwing them at you. They also make a very scary noise. And there are also fast ones. The zombie versions run ... very fast.\nThere are also arachnid creatures. They look like the arachnids from Starship Troopers, but unlike them they can also leap. At one point in the game, you will be able to control them.\nWhen you are not fighting these guys, you will be fighting the Combine, which use guns. There are also striders which are large 3 leg robots with machine guns. And small flying drones.\nFInally, once again, there is plenty of puzzles to do here. Even more thanks to the physics that were added.\n\nThis game has 13 chapters, and lasts ~15 hrs.\n\nThis game also has huge mod library. And the community is still active. That's a great value for the amount of money you pay.","September 27, 2014","true","17.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The graphics are fantastic & the areas in the game often have a kind of gritty realism not seen before in a FPS. City 17 is an amazing backdrop for a game not to mention the surrounding areas such as highway 17, the Nova Prospekt prison complex & especially the citadel which is as alien as Xen but portrayed in a much less organic & much more mechanical Manor. On the whole the HL2 world is an amazing contrast of urban/suburban realism, a variety of outdoor locations & cold alien structures.\nHL2 also attempts to build on the character interaction that was revolutionary in the first game. Later in HL2 you will be joined by resistance fighters that form into a small squad that you can control. However you have extremely limited control over this squad. You simply order them to collectively follow you or move to an area that you point out with the crosshair & that's about it.\nEverything in HL2 behaves as you would expect it to in the real world & this really helps to draw you into the HL2 world. No more so then when you are first let loose with the gravity gun. This 'weapon' almost turns the game into a glorified physics engine demo but Valve have managed to implement this device in such a way that it becomes indispensable in your quest as well as an awe inspiring tool for demonstrating the physics engine.\nThe sound in HL2 is a very strong point. Amazing FX, background sounds & music that suits the action & seems to carve a niche of it's own. It's good to see such attention paid to an area which is sometimes overlooked in games & plays second fiddle to the graphics. In HL2 the sound is as important to the feel of the world as the graphics are. Probably some of the best sound I've ever heard in a game. I thought Doom 3's sound was amazing but HL2's is more subtle & as such often more effective.","December 16, 2015","true","28.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Why haven't you purchased this yet?\n\n\nJokes aside, oh man, I can't express how much enjoyment I get when I play this game.\nUltimately, this is my favorite game out of all the games I own.\nI owe it to one of my Steam friends who generously purchased the Half Life pack for me (while it was on sale too), for me so I could play Half Life.\n\nOut of all the Chapter's, Welcome To Ravenholm was the one I played the most, yet it's hilarious too because I HATE this chapter because I get scared way too easily. Yet the suspense when going through the town and being surprised by zombies or headcrabs, it's kinda hard to not hate this part of the entire game.\n\nZappy's, as I call 'em, are now on the good side, and I'm glad because they shocked my ♥♥♥ too much in Half Life 1 lol. Damn Zappy's, why you gotta shock my butt so much? Another thing about the enemies/protagonists was the weapons you could use when you killed a Combine Soldier. 3OP5me.\n\nOverall, this is one of my favorites, I can play this so many times, but I wouldn't get tired of playing it no matter what.

The AI is a strong point, and although there is little variety of enemies, you don't have a repetitiveness feeling while playing. The Source Engine needs no comments, even after almost 10 years of launching the graphics and physics effects are still convincing. The sound effects are also great.\n\nIt's in the plot that the game stands out even more, the story is great and is able to keep you immersed in the storyline like few games can, there is a good dose of mystery about some events and some of the most epic and charismatic characters. Gordon Freeman is arguably the most badass and emblematic protagonist of the gaming world, without even saying a single word. The secondary characters are also well-built and charismatic.\n\nI highly recommend for those who haven't played. In case of not having played the first and its expansions, is good to seek a source with information about the events prior to this title.\n\n9/10","March 31, 2014","true","12.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","3"

It's a classic among the FPS genre. Featuring the source engine which was amazing at the time this game has been mind blowing.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple just like in the previous game and there's plenty of action to go on, besides that there are puzzles that come along the way. The arsenal ranges from a crowbar to a smart rocket launcher and other alien technology. There is one heroine that accompanies Gordon for a good part of the game. There's at least 20 hours of gameplay in the game without episode 1 and 2.\n\nThe story revolves around Dr. Gordon Freeman who used to work in the Black Mesa research institute and he is one of the survivors from the incident that had a major roll in the invasion of the Combine that occured afterwards. He is hired by an individual with mysterious abilities, the motives of this person are unknown to Gordon. From here on Gordon is placed in City 17 and he begins his struggle against the Combine.\n\nThe graphics and the mechanics of the game are very good to date and bug free.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty fitting if I may say so myself.\n\nThe only issue regarding the game would be the stupidity of the NPC's and possibly the lack of harder difficulty choices and the the changes between them are minor.

The actual story is somewhat of an enigma, but the path you are driven to follow and the characters you meet along the way make journey enjoyable nonetheless.

Instead of being some elite marine, Gordon Freeman is nothing but a scientist forced to fight for suvival.  And the game plays like that.  Without your Biohazard suit you feel about as useful as any of the other Citizens in the world.\n\nEach level is unique and brings around its own gameplay challenges and puzzles.  Do you stop at that house with the smoke comming from it, or continue without stopping?  It's your choice, you are not expected to defeat every single enemy you come across, you can just simply run away.  Not always though.\n\nThe enemy AI is efficient, even if it may cheat somewhat.  They will advance and use cover, use flanking techniques and move as a squad.  It is let down how it seems to know exactly where you are, even after losing line of sight.  Or perhaps the AI is more intelligent than I'm giving it credit for and can hear my footsteps?  Gordon does sound flat footed at times.\n\nThe physics engine is still absolutely amazing and well oiled. Need to get over a ledge, but it's too tall?  Good job there is a see-saw next to it, just load the other end with all those bricks lying around to counter balance your weight.  Can't get that draw bridge down, because you are on the wrong side?  No problem, knock it over with that crane.  Ran out of ammo?  Well luckly there is a toilet bowl here and the gravity gun is fully charged.\n\nIf there is only one thing to gipe about and I do have only the one.  It's the companion AI.  Wait, just here me out.  It starts out fine, with Alyx, just the one.  She get's in your way a bit now and then.  Nothing too annoying, even though she sticks to you like glue and will follow you down every small dead end ally or single exit room.  She will apologize for being in your way, then move away a bit a moment later.  OK, not too much of a problem.  Then you get 4 companions.  All do the same, all stick to you like glue when going down dead end ally ways and block the exit.  The companions can apologise as much about being in the way they as they can, but it will get infuriating at times.  I was evantually glad when a strider wiped them out in a later mission, with no site of reinforcements.\n\nVoice acting is tremendous and you also form bonds with the main characters.  Helped along with the facials expressions the engine is capable of.  I don't remember seeing another video game where so much detail can be put through via facial expressions to show the emotions of each character.\n\nIn closing, Half-Life 2 is a brilliant FPS which hits the right notes in almost every area.  While not a technically impressive as some games released today, the game mechanics are solid and provides an interesting universe and characters to explore.  If you have nether played it, buy it now.  There is no reason to wait for it to go on sale either.","January 18, 2014","true","17.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

Although the developers have done a fantastic job of making it run nice and smooth on modern computers, completely eliminating the constant disk swapping present in the original version, there are still many things that might make the younger gamers hesitant about purchasing this. But enough about that, let's get to the game itself.\n\nThis game practically invented the first person shooter genre. Now, anyone familiar with BASIC programming and the commodore 64 can see where I'm going when I say the commodore 64 was a slow system. Like, really slow. Every time you move, the graphics on screen have to be redrawn, which usually takes a second or two. The game is drastically simplified in that the game, instead of featuring open, free roaming environments, works on a grid based, tile-walk system, similar to pokemon or the old bard's tale games. Over the course of the game, you level up, and can choose to increase either your health, stamina or magika, which really allows the player to take the time to craft the kind of characters they want.\n\nNow on to combat. There are three guns in the game, the pistol, the shotgun, and the SMG. It's up to you to discover their individual strengths and weaknesses in order to get through the loading screens in one piece. Just remember: Ammo is a precious resource, and must be used only when you truly need it.\n\nConcerning the story, it is definately one of the most finely crafted tales ever woven. Beautiful writing. Unfortunately though, you'll still have to download the paragraph book from the half life website, because when the game was first released, they didn't have the data storage to include all that text in the game.\n\nIn conclusion: This game is still a classic, and holds up even today. It is truly sad that the new generations will turn the other cheek at this game and walk away, but in my humble and biased opinion, I give it a buy.","February 14, 2015","true","8.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","7","9","7","1"

Instead of being some elite marine, Gordon Freeman is nothing but a scientist forced to fight for suvival.  And the game plays like that.  Without your Biohazard suit you feel about as useful as any of the other Citizens in the world.\n\nEach level is unique and brings around its own gameplay challenges and puzzles.  Do you stop at that house with the smoke comming from it, or continue without stopping?  It's your choice, you are not expected to defeat every single enemy you come across, you can just simply run away.  Not always though.\n\nThe enemy AI is efficient, even if it may cheat somewhat.  They will advance and use cover, use flanking techniques and move as a squad.  It is let down how it seems to know exactly where you are, even after losing line of sight.  Or perhaps the AI is more intelligent than I'm giving it credit for and can hear my footsteps?  Gordon does sound flat footed at times.\n\nThe physics engine is still absolutely amazing and well oiled. Need to get over a ledge, but it's too tall?  Good job there is a see-saw next to it, just load the other end with all those bricks lying around to counter balance your weight.  Can't get that draw bridge down, because you are on the wrong side?  No problem, knock it over with that crane.  Ran out of ammo?  Well luckly there is a toilet bowl here and the gravity gun is fully charged.\n\nIf there is only one thing to gipe about and I do have only the one.  It's the companion AI.  Wait, just here me out.  It starts out fine, with Alyx, just the one.  She get's in your way a bit now and then.  Nothing too annoying, even though she sticks to you like glue and will follow you down every small dead end ally or single exit room.  She will apologize for being in your way, then move away a bit a moment later.  OK, not too much of a problem.  Then you get 4 companions.  All do the same, all stick to you like glue when going down dead end ally ways and block the exit.  The companions can apologise as much about being in the way they as they can, but it will get infuriating at times.  I was evantually glad when a strider wiped them out in a later mission, with no site of reinforcements.\n\nVoice acting is tremendous and you also form bonds with the main characters.  Helped along with the facials expressions the engine is capable of.  I don't remember seeing another video game where so much detail can be put through via facial expressions to show the emotions of each character.\n\nIn closing, Half-Life 2 is a brilliant FPS which hits the right notes in almost every area.  While not a technically impressive as some games released today, the game mechanics are solid and provides an interesting universe and characters to explore.  If you have nether played it, buy it now.  There is no reason to wait for it to go on sale either.","January 18, 2014","true","17.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

I will break this down as simply as possible and end this debate as approx. 10 students have already asked me this today.\nThe problem as it is written is 6÷2(1+2) , the ÷ cannot be substituted with a fraction bar because they have different ranks on the order of operations. It is an illegal math move to do this. The bar ranks with parentheses, ÷ is interchangeable with *. therefore the problem must be solved as 6÷2(1+2) NOT 6 (over) 2(1+2) we do the parentheses first, so 6÷2(3), the parentheses are now no longer relevant, because the number inside is in it's simplest form. Every single number has implied parentheses around it.\n6÷2(3)\n(6) ÷(2)(3)\n6÷2*3,\nor even converting the division to multiplication by a reciprocal (a legal math move)\n(6)(1 (over) 2)(3)\nare all correct ways to write this problem and mean exactly the same thing. Using pemdas, where md and as are interchangeable, we work from left to right, so (3)(3) or\n3*3= 9\n\nJust because something is implied rather than written does not give it any special rank in the order of operations.\n\nThe problem in it's simplest form, with nothing implied would look like this:\n(1+1+1+1+1+1 (over) 1) ÷ (1+1 (over) 1) * ((1(over) 1) + (1+1 (over) 1))\nFrom here, nothing is implied, This again, works out to 9.\n\nIf the symbol '/' was used this whole debate would be ambiguous since that symbol can mean "to divide by" or it could mean a fraction bar.\n\nHOWEVER, because the ÷ symbol is used, it can not be changed to mean a fraction bar because that would change the order of operations and thus the whole problem, you can't change a symbol to mean something because you want to, in doing so you are changing the problem.\n\nOnce and for all, the answer is 9. But 9-6=3 therefore\n\nHalf-Life 3 confirmed","August 7, 2014","true","14.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

However, this game might have the great gameplay, storyline, characters, and surprisingly great graphics for its time, it is not the best Valve game out there in my opinion. Personally, it's not addictive, but just fun. The weapons all serve a purpose, and the enemies are great. I don't know why, but I don't "feel" like the game is that addictive, and sometimes, navigating can be very, very hard. Beyond challenging. I also encountered a few glitches that drastically messed up my games. However, it's still a great game and worth the money, even though I got this as a gift.

He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went.\nJohn Freeman got his computer shut down and wet on the platform to go up to the roof of the building where he left his motorcycle and normal people close because he was in his office lab coat. John Freeman got on his motorcycl and said "its time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences" so he had to go.\nJohn Freeman ramped off the building and did a backflip and landed. He kept driving down the road and made sure there was no zombies around because he ddint have weapon.\nThe contrysides were nice and the plants were singing and the birds and the sun was almost down from the top of the sky. the mood was set for John Freemans quest to help his brother where he was. John Freeman looked around the countrysides and said "its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys".\nJohn Freeman was late so he had to drive really fast. A cop car was hiden near by so when John Freeman went by the cops came and wanted to give him a ticket. Here John Freeman saw the first monster because the cop was posessed and had headcrabs.\n"I cant give you my lisense officer" John Freeman said\n"Why not?" said the headcrab oficer back to John Freeman.\n"Because you are headcrab zombie" so John Freeman shot the oficer in the head and drove off thinking "my brother is in trouble there" and went faster.\nJohn Freeman had to go faster like the speed of sound and got there fast because Gordon needed him where he was. John Freeman looked at road signs and saw "Ravenholm" with someons writing under it saying "u shudnt come here" so John Freeman almost turned around but heard screaming like Gordon so he went faster again.\nJohn Freeman drove in and did another flip n jumped off his motorbike and the motor bike took out some headcrab zombies infront of John Freeman. John Freeman smiled and walked fast. John Freeman then looked on the ground and found wepon so he pickd it up and fired fast at zombie goasts in front of a house.\nJohn Freeman said "Zombie goasts leave this place" and the zombie goasts said "but this is our house" and John Freeman felt sorry for them becaus they couldnt live there anymore because they were zombie goasts so he blew up the house and killed the zombie goasts so they were at piece.\nThen John Freeman herd another scream from his brother so he kept walking really faster to get where he was. Ravenholdm was nothing like the countrysides there was no birds singing and the pants were dead and teh dirt was messy and bloody from headcrabs.\nWhen John Freeman got to where the screaming was started from he found his brother Gorden Freeman fightin the final bosss and Gordon said "John Freeman! Over here!" so John Freeman went there to where Gordon Freeman was fighting. John Freeman fired his bullet from teh gun really fast and the bullets went and shot the final boss in the eyes and the final boss couldnt see.\nGordon Freeman said "its time to end this ones and for all!" and punched the final boss in the face and the final boss fell. John Freeman said "thanks i could help, bro" and Gordon Freeman said "you should come here earlier next time" and they laughed.\nThe laughed overed quickly though because John Freeman yelled "LOOK OUT BRO!" and pointed up to the top of the sky. Gordon Freeman looked up and said "NOO! John Freeman run out of here fast as you can!" and John Freeman walked real fast out.\nJohn Freeman loked back and saw Gordon get steppd on by the next boss and he was mad and angry.\n"I'll get you back evil boss!"

I already called Half-Life 1 one of the best games i've ever played, but this one is my all-time favourite.\n\nThe game is not even nearly perfect, it is perfect. It's action packed, it got GREAT graphics, animations and more for a game from 2004 and it even got moments which were truly epic.\n\nUnlike the first one, this one offers more puzzles, greater and more evoirments and more action and even a little bit of horror in it. You not only fight against one enemy, no you get to fight headcrabs, helicopters, City 17 Guards, zombies and more. You kill them on your own creative way around the middle of the game when you get more weapons like the Gravity gun, one of my favourites. It let you travel to so many cool area's and not only on foot.. You get to travel to there with for example a car. Absolutly amazing. It's one of the few games of 2004 that offered so many beatiful content and realistic fighting. For example, around the end of the game, you get to control rebels against City 17, they help you, and give you health if needed. Sure, it got it's bugs, sometimes it also brought me motion sickness.. But that didin't stopped me from playing it.\n\nThe ending and the mysterious G-Man makes me wanna' play Episode 1, which i surely will. It's only 9 bucks, so if you want to spent that money on a epic journey with enough replay valaue, then go ahead. Buy this game, a game which i think, never gets old and always will stay one of a kind.\n\nGreat job Valve, this is one of your games to be proud of.","February 7, 2014","true","16.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

While Half-Life 1 most certainly hasn't stood against the test of time, Half-Life 2 has aged like fine wine. Even ten years after it's release, the game looks and feels good. Playing as the mute Gordon Freeman, who arrives off the train in City 17, discovers that the city has been taken over by a force only known as the Combine. Shortly after, he meets the protagonists of the game. If I have to make a complaint, it's that none of the characters in Half-Life 2 besides Gordon and the Gman were in Half-Life 1, so you're just supposed to assume that they were there during the Black Mesa incident. To fully understand the story of Half-Life 1, all you have to do is watch the first ten minutes and the last five minutes of the game. I suggest that you skip straight to this one, and if you really want to pick up Half-Life 1 make sure it's less than $5.","October 14, 2014","true","26.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Gordon Freeman is very intelligent, but half retar:ded (He can't talk and probably can't count to 3). Gordon is waking up in a train after a big party at Gman's, on which he probably drank too much. After that he is walking around a City called 17 (somewhere nearby Russia). 17 is a big city with no rights for people. After that, our Jedi God gets inside a building, and because of that he is chased by the Police called Metro. 17MD (17 Metro Department) is chasing him through the building, because they want to beath him up with a big electric ♥♥♥♥♥. But as you probably can know - Our Jedi God is escaping, as he can matrix-dodge bullets on the rooftops. Then he finally gets beaten up with the ♥♥♥♥♥:s, but a girl called Alyx somehow appears from nowhere. Because of Alyx, our Jedi God couldn't go to heaven (He was going there, everything was white to him). After that, our Gordon is standing up, fixing his undestructible glasses and walks into an elevator with Alyx. After a ride, she wants to buy Jedi God a drink, but instead, she destroys the vending machine as it opens and they walk through it into another room. Then they get inside a lab where a Metro was, also an half-bald, old doctor. They were talking, and the doctor gave Jedi God his Jedi Armour. Then the girl walks into a teleporter and gets EXPLODED,KILLED teleported into another lab. Jedi God didn't had enough luck and get's teleported around the world, finally he lands outside the lab. The Metrocop called Barney throws a crowbar at his face. Crowbar - The most freaking awesome Jedi Weapon the world have seen. Our Jedi is walking around 17 beating everyone's as:s with a crowbar, r:aping women and children blah blah blah he gets to another lab and gets a Jedi Force Powered Gun (JFPG) and blah blah blah he lands in a big glowing and smoking tower called Citadel where his JFPG get's even bigger force, he rekts and pwns everyone there, and an evil gay guy escaped to another world and Jedi was trying to stop him and once again he woke up at Gman's and then he is sleeping again.

And what peace! Police is brutal, resistance fighters are sent to their death in Nova Prospekt or bombed with Headcrabs missiles, the extinction of mankind is planned as no children can be conceived because of a force field suppressor and Dr. Kleiner, your mentor, has as pet an Headcrab (which is a sort of disaster for your buddy Barney Calhoun.\n\nThe gameplay is still the same: you shoot, you kill and you try to stay alive between Headcrabs, Antlions and Combine units. And with your arsenal (bazooka, smg, shotgun, crowbar, antlion stuff, crossbow, etc..), you'll be well equipped. The Gravity Gun is also THE new feature: you can take items and throw them or just carry them. And you'll love the Super Gravity Gun at the end of the game.\n\nThe story will make you visit City 17 before and during the battle for freedom, you'll also take an escape road but very dangerous, see what happens when a town is bombed with missiles, meet a crazy priest, go to the beach, break into a high-security prison and even meet Dr Breen in person. The settings are varied, now that you're outside of Black Mesa and the scientific environement.\n\nThe new enemies are the Combine Army, kinda replacing the HECU units sent to Black Mesa, but with a better technology, the Antlions, a new alien race, that will be your allies and new types of zombies due to new headcrabs: a faster one and a poisonous one. You can set them in fire too.\n\nYou'll ride also a buggy and a hydroboat, which is changing from the wagon cart from Black Mesa.\n\nOtherwise, the allies will be resistance fighters with their chiefs like Eli, Alyx or Barney, though Alyx will be more your sidekick by moments than Barney. Also, the Vortigaunts, these aliens from Xen with green rays, freed from their enslavement, can assist you and recharge your protection.\n\nWith the Source Engine, Valve managed to get beautiful graphics but also, good physics, thanks to the Gravity Gun being the new toy for many players.\n\nAnd the soundtrack! It's still marvelous. Still feeling danger or sad moments or adrenaline.\n\nHalf-Life 2 can be seen as perfect in every aspect... apart the loading time. Or the fact that achievements got implemented at a late date after the release of the Orange Box on Steam (X-box owners had achievements in 2007, PC players got them finally in 2010).\n\nAnyway, fun, drama and action are present and Half-Life 2 is really a must-have.","November 19, 2010","true","27.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

So even if you won't find many challenging fights there (compared to Half Life, which was definitely more difficult), you will still want to keep going and see what more is waiting for you out there..\n\nI also want to recommended Half Life 2 to all the companies who come every year with new but mediocre games.

Sure, the graphics may not be the best ones out there, but it was huge for its time. This makes Half-Life look generally good while being able to run extriemely well with zero major framerate drops; completely smooth framerate. If you don't like the graphics, than you have to give credit to the storyline. Half-Life's story is one of the most gripping game storylines that I've seen. If you get Half-Life 2, Half-Life 1 is a must have. Unless you did some major reading about the first game before playing Half-Life 2, you most likely won't know whats going on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmytro-ielkin/recommended/220/","dmytro-ielkin","Dmytro IELKIN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmytro-ielkin/","131 products in account","Yes, I would like to start this review by saying that this is my second favorite FPS game. That is not say that it is in the second place because it is almost impossible to choose between Half-Life and Half-Life 2. And that would be unfair as well. These games are from different centuries but both are great, equally great. So what makes is so great? Let's find out...\n\nFirst and foremost I'm absolutely blown away by the story. Maybe not by the story itself but by the way it's told. The first game made me feel in the center of attention and action. It felt like it was very important to complete the mission but without making me feeling some sort of superhero that will win anyway. It may sound strange but I can't better words for it. And it continues here with one of the best intros I have seen in a game. Do you remember how the first game ended? Yes, it ended with a monologue of a man in a blue suit after which you agreed to work for him without really knowing who is working for. This game start with another monologue saying that the time has come for you to unleash all your skills and complete another very tall task. It all feels amazingly tense and even though you're ready to spring into action you are not a superhero so don't expect being handed a machinegun and go around shooting.\n\nAs I said the narrative is outstanding throughout the game series and it makes it feel very realistic and natural. I don’t want to spoil it for you so I'll let you see it for yourself. What I can tell you though is the way I felt when I started playing. Let's continue then, shall we?\nSo you awake several years after the end of the first part. It is somewhere in the eastern Europe from what I can tell by the architecture, well by what is left from it. The atmosphere is very grim and depressing and you're alone in a unfamiliar city trying to figure out what you need to do and if there are any friends of yours. The first thing you notice are the screens with propaganda and giant tower that you can see from any part of the city. And all of that really put me in the mood to fight. Because clearly someone is controlling the city and most likely the earth.\nAll of that is backed up by incredible ambient sounds and music. I don't know if it really makes sense to talk about music in this game but if you read review on the original game you'll know that it is something. It follows you around submerges you entirely into everything that is happening around. I first played the game in headphones and that was very wise decision and I'd recommend that to you as well.\n\nWhat kind of atmosphere can be there without proper visuals. And graphics are certainly there. And not just any graphics. Probably the best for the time. For me that is. But considering that it has been more than 10 years since the release of the game you could argue. But if you're into more realistic visuals you can find a mod online that will turn the game into eyecandy.\n\nSo this game has amazing sounds, graphics and story. How does it play then. Well, it pays absolutely fantastic. It is a true sequel and it carried over everything that made the original such a great game. Suit is there, crowbar is there, awesome guns are there to accompany dynamic and fast-paced shooting action. Even if you're not shooting you can still feel the adrenaline. Guns are fantastic to use, blasting through the enemies. And there's variety of enemies ranging from headcrabs to helicopters and giant striders. All of them have very good AI and they never made me feel an overpowered protagonist putting down handicapped enemies. It's complete opposite because I found myself many times low on ammo and low on health hearing suit AI saying "User death imminent". What Half-Life never lacked are the unusual weapons and you'll some this time as well. For example Pulse Rifle which is my favorite and something very special - Gravity Gun. The latter really helps to get out of sticky situations when you're low on ammo or being overpowered by zombies. It has so many uses and every time I figured out something new I felt real scientist. By the way this time you're not doing everything alone. You have friends that will aid in the battle. I would characterize their AI as limited but sometimes they are really helpful. In my opinion their role is to make you feel as a part of Resistance more than anything else. And they certainly succeed at that.\n\nYou will come across quite a few puzzles. What would Half-Life game be without puzzles. They are not that hard but require you to see the big picture. Gordon Freeman went to MIT so those puzzles should be not a problem.\n\nAs with the original game I played Half-Life 2 more than once. I played few times just didn't feel like playing something else and then I played it once again to unlock every single achievement and then I played it prior to Episode One and Two to refresh memories\nThis game is definitely worth picking up even though it's more than 10 years old but it still has that tense, action packed gameplay, immersive music and graphics that hold up today in my opinion.\n\nMore reviews from Gameaways Curator","September 3, 2012","true","25.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You can tell a landmark has occurred when most of what comes after is derivative in some way. The worst part of playing a game this good is being unable to enjoy mediocre titles without feeling let down. A good sign of an underperforming developer is when they react to being compared to games like this with the phrase 'gamer entitlement'. If you only play games with friends, download the Synergy mod available on Steam.","July 14, 2013","true","23.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can tell a landmark has occurred when most of what comes after is derivative in some way. The worst part of playing a game this good is being unable to enjoy mediocre titles without feeling let down. A good sign of an underperforming developer is when they react to being compared to games like this with the phrase 'gamer entitlement'.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bipabrena/recommended/220/","bipabrena","Metatron | trade.tf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bipabrena/","31 products in account","Half-Life 2 is extremely well-made and passionately executed. So often the game makes you chuckle in disbelief, press the "F9" (load last save) key because you feel you *must* see that breathtaking sequence again and in overall it makes you replay it time and time again. This game is, in simple words, an astounding accomplishment.\n\nExceptionally well thought-out storyline and immersive experience; we see everything from Gordon's eyes. Half-Life is unique in the sense that you are not the intended game's protagonist, the game's protagonist is YOU. Everything is left up to your own interpretation, understanding and words. There's so much to say about the saga of Half-Life (because yes, the Episodes as well as the first game and its two expansions, OF and BS, are just as fantastic), but words are weak to convey justice to such a magnificent game. In my opinion, it is simply the best first-person shooter of all time. The most well thought-out and influential, at least. Even though the typical "dystopia-alien invasion" storyline is quite common these days, Valve found a way to make it unique. I believe what makes Half-Life stand out from everything else is that Valve grabbed a storyline which is now common and sometimes hackneyed and made it BELIEVABLE. They made it feel REALISTIC and BELIEVABLE to the player, and crafted a wonderful, unusual protagonist which was given somewhat of a story but the rest is filled by you; this protagonist makes this absurd world of aliens, torture, blood, fear and dystopia work, no matter how unrealistic it may seem.\n\nHalf-Life, the entire franchise, has haunted me for a long time. The story is as rich and big in complexity as it is in enigma, so many questions are conveyed and yet left unanswered. I love the game, I'm in complete love with Gordon Freeman and the other characters (specially Barney) and with how well all the chapters in this game were made. Ravenholm is capable to fetch a perception of sadness and fear, the rebellion and the uprising elude feelings of both hope and doom, questions of *what* is going to happen arise and more disappointment appears because there are *no* definite answers, at all. Valve keeps throwing stuff at you and you don't ever have enough time to process it. And when you sit down to think about it, too many answers are possible. Valve takes the whole "open to interpretation" notion at a whole new level.\n\nI'd recommend this game to everyone, and if you don't have this game in your Steam library, I'M JUDGING YOU REAL HARD HERE. No, but it's a must-play, even if it isn't your type of game. Even with how exceptional the game is, however, many people may not and do not enjoy it, not only because it might not be "their cup of tea", but because Half-Life 2 is a game which requires patience (not as much as the first, though!), and it may not be a good game to someone who plays games to slouch or relax a bit, or to play for a short while. It's pretty intense and hectic. However, I'd still recommend it nonetheless.\n\nHalf-Life 2 gets a 10 out of 5 from me!","January 26, 2015","true","46.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bipabrena/recommended/220/","bipabrena","Metatron | trade.tf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bipabrena/","31 products in account","Half-Life 2 is extremely well-made and passionately executed. So often the game makes you chuckle in disbelief, press the "F9" (load last save) key because you feel you *must* see that breathtaking sequence again and in overall it makes you replay it time and time again. This game is, in simple words, an astounding accomplishment.\n\nExceptionally well thought-out storyline and immersive experience; we see everything from Gordon's eyes. Half-Life is unique in the sense that you are not the intended game's protagonist, the game's protagonist is YOU. Everything is left up to your own interpretation, understanding and words. There's so much to say about the saga of Half-Life (because yes, the Episodes as well as the first game and its two expansions, OF and BS, are just as fantastic), but words are weak to convey justice to such a magnificent game. In my opinion, it is simply the best first-person shooter of all time. The most well thought-out and influential, at least. Even though the typical "dystopia-alien invasion" storyline is quite common these days, Valve found a way to make it unique. I believe what makes Half-Life stand out from everything else is that Valve grabbed a storyline which is now common and sometimes hackneyed and made it BELIEVABLE. They made it feel REALISTIC and BELIEVABLE to the player, and crafted a wonderful, unusual protagonist which was given somewhat of a story but the rest is filled by you; this protagonist makes this absurd world of aliens, torture, blood, fear and dystopia work, no matter how unrealistic it may seem.\n\nHalf-Life, the entire franchise, has haunted me for a long time. The story is as rich and big in complexity as it is in enigma, so many questions are conveyed and yet left unanswered. I love the game, I'm in complete love with Gordon Freeman and the other characters (specially Barney) and with how well all the chapters in this game were made. Ravenholm is capable to fetch a perception of sadness and fear, the rebellion and the uprising elude feelings of both hope and doom, questions of *what* is going to happen arise and more disappointment appears because there are *no* definite answers, at all. Valve keeps throwing stuff at you and you don't ever have enough time to process it. And when you sit down to think about it, too many answers are possible. Valve takes the whole "open to interpretation" notion at a whole new level.\n\nI'd recommend this game to everyone, and if you don't have this game in your Steam library, I'M JUDGING YOU REAL HARD HERE. No, but it's a must-play, even if it isn't your type of game. Even with how exceptional the game is, however, many people may not and do not enjoy it, not only because it might not be "their cup of tea", but because Half-Life 2 is a game which requires patience (not as much as the first, though!), and it may not be a good game to someone who plays games to slouch or relax a bit, or to play for a short while. It's pretty intense and hectic. However, I'd still recommend it nonetheless.\n\nHalf-Life 2 gets a 10 out of 5 from me!","January 26, 2015","true","46.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

This game was the bomb when it came out in 2004 and it is still known as one of the best FPS games on the market but this game has a huge bit of history behind it when Valve finished Half-Life 1 they wanted to make a sequel right away but in 2003 after the E3 showcase of the game an ANON German hacker had leaked the files onto the internet and at the time the game was virtually unplayable. This also leaked some CSS BETA content and TF2 ALPHA content but this was one of the biggest thefts at the time and it will stand out in gaming history for a long time and it will always be with the people that have lived through 2003. Finally in 2004 this game was released to the general public with an outstanding physics engine, astonishing shader detail, a jampacked level editor in the files and daziling facial posing NOW can you see why this game is defined as a classic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/recommended/220/","DangerousSaiga","Dangerous Saiga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/","221 products in account","Half-Life 2. The video game that started the modern generation on first-person shooters and revamped the gaming history into a new era. Originally released in November 2004, the game won multiple game of the year awards and branched gameplay mechanics, including physics and the state-of-the-art game engine that look realistic during its release date. Many people are aware on the game’s popularity and everlasting legacy including various jokes on the awaiting sequel (for many years), but the question remains: Why is this game popular?\n\nThe game takes place after the events from Half-Life. You play as Gordon Freeman, the silent protagonist who got a Ph.D. on theoretical physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and knows how to use weapons very effectively; a strange paradox for a character with such features yet highly popular and well-recognized. You are sent to City 17 by the G-Man, a mysterious person or a phenomenon with a mysterious and ambiguous agenda, to overthrow Wallace Breen and the alien oppressors, the Combine. The setting and lore in the Half-Life universe is simply the best, taking some influence from George Orwell’s 1984 or other famous dystopian novels to set the story in tone. Gordon’s influence and previous actions will spark oppressed citizens in City 17 to take arms and revolt against the Combine. From City 17 to the prison at Nova Prospekt, each setting is unique, bleak, but beautifully designed, the game simply defined what a video game should be.\n\nEach NPCs and major characters such as Doctor Issac Kleiner, Barney Calhoun, and other characters interact realistically among each other and to you. In regards to Alyx Vance, your ally and companion, Valve spawned the concept of AI teammates and became a true asset in your journey to rally up the oppressed citizens. Besides good character developments, the best attribute for Half-Life 2 was physic interactions and the game engine. The game engine is Source, which feature high-dynamic range rendering, facial animations, and “realistic physics”; the first game that had such a feature like this.\n\nAre there criticisms for the game? I believe so, but to be honest, I couldn’t find any legitimate criticisms for the game. If one criticism has to be addressed, then the problem is the loading sections. Yes, those tedious loading that interrupted the “flow” in the middle of a long level or after finishing a series of firefights against Civil Protection or Combine forces. These loading or “checkpoints” really halt the immersion in the game. However, this is very common on all Half-Life games and I hope that Valve would address this (if they are working on the sequel…).\n\nHalf-Life 2 is pure gold, shining flawlessly on the test of time. With great graphical fidelity at its time, voice acting and realistic AI interaction from your allies and enemies, this game is a rare exception of genuine perfection and grand role model for other game developers to pursue their own game designs. The only thing Half-Life 2 (and its episodes) is a full fledge sequel. Besides many jokes, anxieties, and waning patience for Valve to announce the sequel, the game should be in every PC gamer’s Steam library. No exception. Half-Life 2 is simply the best; a grand overture that started and defined the modern gaming industry in the present time.\n","June 4","true","14.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The atmosphere, characters and Source engine were all, putting it mildly, revolutionary at the time. They all still hold up well today. Not to mention it CHANGED THE GAMING INDUSTRY, even more so than Half-Life 1 did. Think about it. Without HL2, Steam would probably be dead, in which case thousands of indie games would've never been made, let alone gain as much popularity, forcing all those indie developers to stop making games. Without HL2, Valve probably wouldn't have made their other masterpieces (Portal, TF2, L4D, etc.) Without HL2, and its amazing mod support, we wouldn't have gotten the best modding community ever in gaming.\nThere are too many good things to say about Half-Life 2, so I'll make a long review short:\nBuy it.

Half-Life continues the story of Gordon Freeman as he is woken up only to find that Earth has been taken over by an alien empire - the Combine. Throughout the game, he gets help from human resistance and former allies from Black Mesa.\n\nPuzzles are pretty much kept at the first installation's style, though I found them to be way easier. In Half-Life 2, there are more vehicles - an airboat and a buggy are added and they provide some more refreshing gameplay where you drive with them and ocassionally have to stop in order to solve a puzzle, because the path is blocked.\n\nGame features more weapons, most importantly - the gravity gun. I guess it shows the psychics of the source engine, but its a pretty fun weapon to use, some areas can be cleared without using any firearms. Near the end of the game it becomes even better and more powerful.\n\nObviously, it has better graphics than Half-Life 1.\n\nFor those that liked the first game - this is a must buy. I guess you can still play it as your first game from the franchise, but it just isn't the same in my opinion.\n\n","January 6","true","9.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Why? Because with just HL2 you unlock the ability to literally play thousands of free mods, some of which are of higher quality or more fun than HL2 itself, as well as the tools to make your own mods and maps. If you haven't played HL1 and are worried about HL2, Don't. The story is just as bizarre as ever and the token "unexplainable ending" of all Half Life games has returned yet again.","August 29, 2013","true","1.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WJKovacs/recommended/220/","WJKovacs","W.J. Kovacs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WJKovacs/","33 products in account","I recommend this game with CAUTION. From what I've played this game supports only one playstyle. If you're not running around constantly dodging bullets and getting up in peoples' faces (aliens, whatever), you're DEAD. I appreciate the lack of regenerating health, though. Half-Life 2 features some of the most annoying enemies ever. They have no personality whatsoever (unlike Wheatley from Portal 2 or the enemies in Halo). Game options could have a "very low to ultra" option to save time. There is little variety in the 3 hours I've played.\n\nThe story is all right. I'm neither utterly bored by it or blown away. Aliens, resistance, the usual.\n\nPuzzles are all right. Navigation, though, is another story. In the beginning of the game, there is a canal you have to walk through. The way to continue is on the SIDE of a box, and the game doesn't give a hint where you're supposed to go. Batman gave subtle hints to the player through his inner thoughts in the Arkham games. Gordon Freeman didn't have to speak, but seriously, the exploration system definitely detracted from the experience.\n\nGun variety is HORRIBLE. You have to play with the same gun until you reach a certain point in which you can pick up a new gun. Rinse and repeat. Now, I know the generic alien army Combines are supposed to carry the same weapons, but couldn't the resistance give/modify cool weapons like in any good resistance story?\n\nConclusion: If you are willing to run around like Duke Nukem most of the game guns blazing, then spend your money on this. If you are willing to do puzzles, spend your money on this. If you are willing to wait a couple of levels to get a new gun, spend your money on this. I can barely recommend this game, because the playstyle it forced me to use made me more alert and fast. I can't say that I had a lot of fun, though.","April 12, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WJKovacs/recommended/220/","WJKovacs","W.J. Kovacs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WJKovacs/","33 products in account","I recommend this game with CAUTION. From what I've played this game supports only one playstyle. If you're not running around constantly dodging bullets and getting up in peoples' faces (aliens, whatever), you're DEAD. I appreciate the lack of regenerating health, though. Half-Life 2 features some of the most annoying enemies ever. They have no personality whatsoever (unlike Wheatley from Portal 2 or the enemies in Halo). Game options could have a "very low to ultra" option to save time. There is little variety in the 3 hours I've played.\n\nThe story is all right. I'm neither utterly bored by it or blown away. Aliens, resistance, the usual.\n\nPuzzles are all right. Navigation, though, is another story. In the beginning of the game, there is a canal you have to walk through. The way to continue is on the SIDE of a box, and the game doesn't give a hint where you're supposed to go. Batman gave subtle hints to the player through his inner thoughts in the Arkham games. Gordon Freeman didn't have to speak, but seriously, the exploration system definitely detracted from the experience.\n\nGun variety is HORRIBLE. You have to play with the same gun until you reach a certain point in which you can pick up a new gun. Rinse and repeat. Now, I know the generic alien army Combines are supposed to carry the same weapons, but couldn't the resistance give/modify cool weapons like in any good resistance story?\n\nConclusion: If you are willing to run around like Duke Nukem most of the game guns blazing, then spend your money on this. If you are willing to do puzzles, spend your money on this. If you are willing to wait a couple of levels to get a new gun, spend your money on this. I can barely recommend this game, because the playstyle it forced me to use made me more alert and fast. I can't say that I had a lot of fun, though.","April 12, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The level design, the immersive atmosphere, the innovative use of physics, the graphics (which still hold up), the structure, the pacing, the characters, the story, the weapons...all are exceptional.  It's a game that can be played over and over.  One negative would be the AI which was decent at the time but feels a little dated now.  That's a minor gripe.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DT_76/recommended/220/","DT_76","DT76","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DT_76/","62 products in account","In some ways, this is a very old-fashioned FPS.  You have a variety of weapons, but can only hold so much ammo.   When you pick up stuff (by touching it), it adds those bullets/health to your supplies if you have any missing, and any excess is lost.  Carrying around health packs/extra ammo is impossible.  You still progress through a bunch of areas, needing to press the right button or trigger the right event to proceed.\nWhat sets it apart is the obvious polish, quality design, and good story.  The game uses only in-engine cinematics, and never takes over the player's camera.  It counts on you to observe the world around you, take an interest in the environment, and solve the various physics puzzles.\n\nInstead of just a bunch of corridors and enemies (though it has those, too), it focuses on small engagements, then big set-piece battles.  You'll play for a while in one setting on foot, then switch to a more vehicle-oriented bit, then a new mechanic is introduced, then it kind of repeats those 3, etc.  This varies up the gameplay and keeps introducing fresh concepts through little in-game tutorials.\n\nAbout the only complaint I had is that the game wants you to be immersed in its world, and use their impressive physics engine to solve puzzles.  It wants you to approach the obstacles as if you were actually there, making use of the objects around you to get past them.  This is great when it works, like making use of plastic barrels' buoyancy to get past one spot, but then you get to points where you try out a solution over and over, convinced it should be working, and it won't.  Oh, it should work, because it seems obvious, and because it totally would work in the real world, but in the game they want you to do something else pre-scripted, and until you figure out what that thing is, you're not going anywhere.  They make you stack boxes & crates in several spots to climb up/over things, but try it in the wrong place and you'll hit an invisible wall.  There's one area where you have to get past an electric fence and can see the power cable running above you.  Even though you've got a way to hurl nice big, sharp, wide saw blades with great speed and accuracy, you can't sever that cable.  No amount of shooting will help, either.  That cable's not a solid object, it's just there to let you know where to go to hit the switch that you need to find in order to turn off the fence.\nDespite a few tired elements and some minor breaks in the immersion, this is one hell of a game.","July 7, 2014","true","21.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You are one man army who's fighting the combine , an immense and powerful interdimensional organization, composed of a massive variety of both allied and enslaved species with the help of your fellow rebels . Also dealing with strange creatures , and again , Zombies and headcrabs on the side .\n\nIt all depends on YOU to bring down the combine , can you do it ?\n\n(+)Content :  The content is huge ! While playing the game and  through each level , you'll be facing new enemies , gaining new weapons and new allies on the road . This means no repetetive content , and lots of fun fun !\n\n(+)Gameplay :  Let's be honest , Half-Life series are the best FPS games out there . There is no need for a description of how great it is , you'll be noticing it the moment you get your .. gun . It's gonna take some time tho , you gotta kick some ♥♥♥ with the classic Crowbar first !\n\n\n\nIn my honest opinion , this game is definetely worth .. Hold on .. Half-Life 1 + Half Life 2 = Half Life 3 confirmed ??\n\n10/10 -   Triskelion Turbella Reviews","November 23, 2014","true","40.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Graphiquement on a le Source Engine version 2010, pas le plus beau mais qui restitue bien les environnements divers que l'équipe artistique à rendu réaliste au possible dans l'univers de science fiction propre à Half-Life. Niveau gameplay on a un FPS classique, mais l'ajout du Gravity Gun et des mécaniques de jeu orientées physiques (jouer avec le décor pour tuer les ennemis par exemple) crée une particularité, presque une révolution du gameplay. Une liberté quasi totale. La durée de vie est excellente, le prix est faible (préférez l'Orange Box qui a l'intégrale HL2 plus Portal et TF2 pour le tout petit prix de 20€) et la qualité est exemplaire. On pousse plus loin l'intrigue avec de nouveaux personnages.

You are still Gordon Freeman and still as silent as ever, soaking it all in. Some say that he is an empty husk devoid of character, while others treat his silence as an opportunity to let themselves react to the events in the world around them rather than being told how Gordon feels; YOU are Gordon Freeman.\n\nThe Source engine was debuted in HL2 and there are many little physics 'puzzles', to use the word generously, that show off the engine's bells and whistles. The gravity gun is really where it shines though.\nThe AI is competent (any veteran FPS player will have to play on the hardest difficulty setting), and there are many wonderful action set-pieces in well-fleshed out locales.\n\nThat's about all I can say here; I may share my thoughts on Episodes 1 and 2 at a later date.\nUntil then, happy headcrab hunting.","November 25, 2013","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Valve seems to know how to make great sequels. [Portal 2, Team Fortress 2, Half-Life 2] Yeah, I've already said it. This is a great game. For the graphics, they have certainly aged well.

I found the game kinda difficult (on Normal mode) but the difficulty amps up quite a bit in Ravenholm.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PISTOOLZ/recommended/220/","PISTOOLZ","TOOLZ ~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PISTOOLZ/","224 products in account","Like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 is a single-player first-person shooter broken into several chapters, permanently casting the player as the protagonist Gordon Freeman.\nThe sequel has nearly the same mechanics as Half-Life, including health-and-weapon systems and periodic physics puzzles, except with the newer Source Engine and improved graphics. The player also starts without items, slowly building up an arsenal over the course of the game. Despite the game's mainly linear nature, much effort was put into making exploration rewarding and interesting; many optional areas can be missed or avoided.\n\nA diverse set of enemies are present, which usually require being approached with different tactics: some coordinate in groups to out-maneuver or out-position the player; others, like the Manhack, fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors; some use predictable but powerful attacks, while others hide before swiftly attacking the player. Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons, or make use of indirect means, exploiting environmental hazards such as explosive pressurized canisters, gas fires or improvised traps. At one point in the game, Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers, and can send his team further from him or call them back; however, they can still die easily due to lack of damage protection. Squad members are indicated on the HUD (squad member icons with a cross sign are field medics).\n\nMany of the game's new features utilize its detailed physics simulation. Two sections of the game involve driving vehicles. Instead of button-based puzzles from Half-Life, environmental puzzles are also introduced with makeshift mechanical systems, revolving around the player's new ability to pick up, move, and place objects. Solutions involve objects' physical properties, such as shape, weight, and buoyancy. For example, in Chapter 3, Route Kanal, the player is required to stack cinder blocks on a makeshift see-saw ramp to proceed over a wall.\n\nPart-way through the game, Gordon acquires the Gravity Gun, which allows him to draw distant objects towards himself or forcefully push them away, as well as to manipulate larger and heavier objects than he is able to alone. These abilities are required to solve puzzles later in the game, and can also be used to great effect in combat, as any non-static object within proximity to the player has the potential to be used as a makeshift defense (e.g. a file cabinet) or a deadly projectile (e.g. a gasoline can or a buzzsaw blade).\n\nThe game never separates the player with pre-rendered cutscenes or events; the story proceeds via exposition from other characters and in-world events, and ensures that the player controls Gordon for the entirety of the game. Much of the backstory to the game is simply alluded to, or told through the environment.\n\nSource; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_life_2","February 10, 2014","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had it when I plugged a power cable into a lan card and fried it.  Oh young dumb PC accidents.  Half Life 2 is a build upon an already amazing franchise.  One that spawned Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat from free Half Life mods to actual stand alone games that were sold in stores.  Half Life 2 is an incredible game with stunning graphics and great AI - for its time.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and with the use of Developer Mode, players that are playing the game through for a second, third, or fourth time can enable fun gravity settings or thousands of other commands.  The story line in the game itself is the classic FPS Hero vs The World.\n\nI would rate this game a 9.2/10 because it is still a classic, a benchmark to gaming, a sequel to one of the best games ever made and still one of the highest META rated games in the world.  Half Life 2 is worth the few dollars to purchase - as well as all of the other Valve titles.","February 10, 2014","true","16.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had no complaints at all when I was playing, and enjoyed every moment I spent in this game. Easily one of if not the best first person shooter to this date.

It may not be some heavily gameplay design focused super polished masterpiece like Doom. However the atmosphere, the characters, the physics and environment interaction that still hold up, every big to subtle tid bit of detail where you can tell they poured every ounce of talent and soul into, it all just comes together to make one of the most profound video games ever made. Not to say the gameplay isn't special, for being the game series that sort of set off the whole trend of a more linear focused level design punctuated by amazing scripted events, the gameplay is still miles ahead of most modern FPS games today that do the same thing. One of the things that captures me the most about this game is the absolute sheer amount of variation of different situations this game throws at you. The game absolutely never gets repetitive at all, the game always tosses situations at you that you never really have done beforehand in the game. The fact that the game still captures that feeling of immersion without ever having to sacrifice that feeling in order to make the level design gameplay oriented is just amazing.\n\nI could go on but I don't really think too many people would read this, and everyone already knows how good this game is.

Once you've played this game make sure to play HL2 E1 and E2.\nI also recommend purchasing the first Half Life aswell as its spin off games Half Life Blue Shift and Half Life Opposing force.","December 29, 2013","true","24.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

From shooters, to racers, to RPG's to RTS's... It has never been a better time to be a gamer nowadays. The choice we have as gamers is overwhelming, and even though there are a lot of flawed products out there, a lot of great titles make their way into our libraries on an yearly basis. As I see it, video games are divided into three categories: Bad, Decent, and Great, from worse to best.\nBut some games are so unique, different and so many light years ahead of everything else, they don't quite fall under any kind of category. I know a few of these games myself. Half Life 2 is also light years ahead of those games.\n\nHalf Life 2 is an experience. It's almost movie like in it's immersion. I found myself caring about the protagonist, Gordon Freeman, my allies Alyx and Eli Vance, Dr Mossman and Dr K, in the fight against the fascist alien race known as the combine. I found myself caring about every little detail of what happened to them, and to my surprise, I have never felt this happy, sad and angry while playing a video game. It truly is an experience.\n\nI won't spoil the story to anyone, but it is by far, and in my opinion, the best story ever put into the video game form, for what it tells you, for what you have to figure out for yourself, and for the most intriguing and misterious character to ever grace a PC game (or any game for that matter): The G-man. When you play this game, you will know exactly what I am talking about.\n\nGameplay is varied, and the controls are close to perfection. You will walk and shoot like an FPS, drive a boat and buggy. The common link between them is the fact they are seamless and feel like you are on a true quest, no section is out of place and they are all extremely well done. The concept of levels isn't quite present, as the game world feels like a whole.\n\nHalf life 2 is an amazing accomplishment. It is the proof that games can be art, and can rival Hollywood in story telling. Make no mistake, Half Life 2 is in my opinion, the best game ever made, and worth every penny and minute you put into it. It is a rewarding experience like no other, and there are almost no games who can even compare to it. A timeless masterpiece.\n\nThe Good\n\nExtremely fun to play\nGroundbreaking story\nEnemy AI\nShooting mechanics\nVaried gameplay\n\nThe Bad\n\nNothing I can think of, it really is that good, and as close to perfection as you will ever get.\n\n10/10 - Legendary","December 5, 2013","true","22.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I couldn't believe it was quite this good. I chuckled in muddled disbelief, expectations utterly defied. My nervous fingers reloaded the level, knowing that I had to see that breathtaking sequence one more time. It was then that I knew for certain: Valve had surpassed not only themselves, but everyone else too. Half-Life 2 is an astounding accomplishment. It is the definitive statement of the last five years of first-person shooters. Everything else was just a stopgap.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a near perfect sequel. It takes almost everything that worked from Half-Life and either improves on it, or keeps it much the same. But that simple summation undersells how the Valve team have approached this task. Half-Life 2 is a linear shooter with most of the refinements one would expect from years of work, but it is also a game of a higher order of magnitude than any of the previous pretenders to the throne. The polish and the stratospheric height of the production values mean that Half-Life 2 is a magnificent, dramatic experience that has few peers.\n\nIt would be madness for me to spoil this game by talking about the specific turn of events, so spoilers are going to be kept to a minimum. We're going to talk about general processes and the elements of style and design that make Half-Life 2 such an energising experience. Key to this is the way in which Gordon's tale is told. Once again we never leave his perspective. There are no cutscenes, no moment in which you are anything but utterly embedded in Gordon's view of the world. Everything is told through his eyes. And what a story it is. Gordon arrives at the central station at City 17—a disruptive and chilling dystopia. And from there? Well, that would be telling. This is not the contemporary America that Gordon seemed to be living in during the original Half-Life. The events of Black Mesa have affected the whole world. The crossover with Xen has meant that things have altered radically, with hyper-technology existing alongside eastern bloc dereliction.","November 5, 2014","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WJKovacs/recommended/220/","WJKovacs","W.J. Kovacs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WJKovacs/","33 products in account","I recommend this game with CAUTION. From what I've played this game supports only one playstyle. If you're not running around constantly dodging bullets and getting up in peoples' faces (aliens, whatever), you're DEAD. I appreciate the lack of regenerating health, though. Half-Life 2 features some of the most annoying enemies ever. They have no personality whatsoever (unlike Wheatley from Portal 2 or the enemies in Halo). Game options could have a "very low to ultra" option to save time. There is little variety in the 3 hours I've played.\n\nThe story is all right. I'm neither utterly bored by it or blown away. Aliens, resistance, the usual.\n\nPuzzles are all right. Navigation, though, is another story. In the beginning of the game, there is a canal you have to walk through. The way to continue is on the SIDE of a box, and the game doesn't give a hint where you're supposed to go. Batman gave subtle hints to the player through his inner thoughts in the Arkham games. Gordon Freeman didn't have to speak, but seriously, the exploration system definitely detracted from the experience.\n\nGun variety is HORRIBLE. You have to play with the same gun until you reach a certain point in which you can pick up a new gun. Rinse and repeat. Now, I know the generic alien army Combines are supposed to carry the same weapons, but couldn't the resistance give/modify cool weapons like in any good resistance story?\n\nConclusion: If you are willing to run around like Duke Nukem most of the game guns blazing, then spend your money on this. If you are willing to do puzzles, spend your money on this. If you are willing to wait a couple of levels to get a new gun, spend your money on this. I can barely recommend this game, because the playstyle it forced me to use made me more alert and fast. I can't say that I had a lot of fun, though.","April 12, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Niveau gameplay on a un FPS classique, mais l'ajout du Gravity Gun et des mécaniques de jeu orientées physiques (jouer avec le décor pour tuer les ennemis par exemple) crée une particularité, presque une révolution du gameplay. Une liberté quasi totale.

It remains entertaining even all the way through to Episode 1 and 2, contains unique weapons, great graphics that stand out even today, and an excellent game engine that is still being used by Valve and indie game devs in this day and age.\n\nWhile there are some weapons that just don't feel right in this game whether it's how they feel when firing them or simply holding them and the game has a bad habit of repeating itself in certain instances, I felt HL2 is an excellent game that got's flaws, but that can forgiven for what it delivers in its 15-hour journey.","February 24, 2015","true","32.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cxero/recommended/220/","cxero","Sgt. Tactifag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cxero/","76 products in account","Half-Life 2 is a nice little FPS game that lets you think outside the box when it comes to gameplay. The game was a big deal when it was released, being the successor to the original Half-Life, which was just as critically acclaimed as the sequel.\n\nGAMEPLAY (8/10)\nHalf-Life 2, like I said earlier, really lets you think outside the box. It's one of the few games that integrates the physics engine into the gameplay. You can use your "gravity gun" to hurl projectiles at the bad guys, or use physics objects to aid you in the gameplay, like quickly scrabbling together a makeshift barricade from barrels and wooden palletes. The gunplay has aged a bit - Half-Life 2 doesn't have a cover system, leaning system (really wish it had this), iron sights, steady aim feature, or many of the things that are common in modern titles. The game was fairly classic-styled even at the time in this way. Sometimes, the classic style serves the game well - other times, it just makes it not as up to par to games of today.\n\nPRESENTATION (9/10)\nHalf-Life 2 is great in this aspect, especially for its time. The game has really great music that gets you pumped up for action. The graphics looked pretty good for 2004. The characters look extremely realistic and have really great animations, too - something that was revolutionary when Half-Life 2 came out. The voice actors are pretty good and deliver lines believably and with emotion.\n\nSTORY (9/10)\nThe game has a unique storytelling method. It rarely reveals detail directly. However, that does not make the story have any less depth. The developers left around many clues that leave you guessing and speculating about the backstory. Put all the clues together and you have a really well-crafted backstory. The game has an interesting cyberpunk, dystopian setting with believable characters. The main plotline is good and fairly realistic. Control is never taken from the player, except times where it makes sense - That's right, they don't interrupt the gameplay with cutscenes.\n\nGood game. If you haven't played it already, it's considered a classic. If you have ever enjoyed a FPS, you'll like this one.","March 4, 2015","true","23.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can enjoy the graphics and hate the realism of monsters .\n\n(+)Musics / Soundtracks :  Soundtracks are great . The timing and genre fits most situations perfectly , making you feel special :3\n\n(+)Story : Absolutely perfect . You're Gordan Freeman , a theoretical physicist who had hardly earned the distinction of his Ph.D. (According to Wallace Breen). You are one man army who's fighting the combine , an immense and powerful interdimensional organization, composed of a massive variety of both allied and enslaved species with the help of your fellow rebels . Also dealing with strange creatures , and again , Zombies and headcrabs on the side .\n\nIt all depends on YOU to bring down the combine , can you do it ?\n\n(+)Content :  The content is huge ! While playing the game and  through each level , you'll be facing new enemies , gaining new weapons and new allies on the road . This means no repetetive content , and lots of fun fun !\n\n(+)Gameplay :  Let's be honest , Half-Life series are the best FPS games out there . There is no need for a description of how great it is , you'll be noticing it the moment you get your .. gun . It's gonna take some time tho , you gotta kick some ♥♥♥ with the classic Crowbar first !\n\n\n\nIn my honest opinion , this game is definetely worth .. Hold on ..

I have no problem saying that it is my number one favorite. Even today, the physics engine is extraordinary and is still being used in games today. An entire generation of game making, mod making, and even short films was all born from this one game, and that still blows my mind.\n\nThe story is just as intense as a Hollywood movie. You care about the characters and you really want to help your allies and strike down your enemies. It is an incredibly immersive experience. Story wise, the entire Half-Life franchise (especially this installment) make it the best video game franchise in history. Despite what some people say, this game has aged incredibly well. There will be more games in the future, some incredible and some horrible. Maybe the magic of Half-Life 2 will be matched, but I personally believe it will never be exceeded.\n\nI loved this game in every respect.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PISTOOLZ/recommended/220/","PISTOOLZ","TOOLZ ~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PISTOOLZ/","224 products in account","Like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 is a single-player first-person shooter broken into several chapters, permanently casting the player as the protagonist Gordon Freeman.\nThe sequel has nearly the same mechanics as Half-Life, including health-and-weapon systems and periodic physics puzzles, except with the newer Source Engine and improved graphics. The player also starts without items, slowly building up an arsenal over the course of the game. Despite the game's mainly linear nature, much effort was put into making exploration rewarding and interesting; many optional areas can be missed or avoided.\n\nA diverse set of enemies are present, which usually require being approached with different tactics: some coordinate in groups to out-maneuver or out-position the player; others, like the Manhack, fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors; some use predictable but powerful attacks, while others hide before swiftly attacking the player. Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons, or make use of indirect means, exploiting environmental hazards such as explosive pressurized canisters, gas fires or improvised traps. At one point in the game, Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers, and can send his team further from him or call them back; however, they can still die easily due to lack of damage protection. Squad members are indicated on the HUD (squad member icons with a cross sign are field medics).\n\nMany of the game's new features utilize its detailed physics simulation. Two sections of the game involve driving vehicles. Instead of button-based puzzles from Half-Life, environmental puzzles are also introduced with makeshift mechanical systems, revolving around the player's new ability to pick up, move, and place objects. Solutions involve objects' physical properties, such as shape, weight, and buoyancy. For example, in Chapter 3, Route Kanal, the player is required to stack cinder blocks on a makeshift see-saw ramp to proceed over a wall.\n\nPart-way through the game, Gordon acquires the Gravity Gun, which allows him to draw distant objects towards himself or forcefully push them away, as well as to manipulate larger and heavier objects than he is able to alone. These abilities are required to solve puzzles later in the game, and can also be used to great effect in combat, as any non-static object within proximity to the player has the potential to be used as a makeshift defense (e.g. a file cabinet) or a deadly projectile (e.g. a gasoline can or a buzzsaw blade).\n\nThe game never separates the player with pre-rendered cutscenes or events; the story proceeds via exposition from other characters and in-world events, and ensures that the player controls Gordon for the entirety of the game. Much of the backstory to the game is simply alluded to, or told through the environment.\n\nSource; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_life_2","February 10, 2014","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had it when I plugged a power cable into a lan card and fried it.  Oh young dumb PC accidents.  Half Life 2 is a build upon an already amazing franchise.  One that spawned Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat from free Half Life mods to actual stand alone games that were sold in stores.  Half Life 2 is an incredible game with stunning graphics and great AI - for its time.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and with the use of Developer Mode, players that are playing the game through for a second, third, or fourth time can enable fun gravity settings or thousands of other commands.  The story line in the game itself is the classic FPS Hero vs The World.\n\nI would rate this game a 9.2/10 because it is still a classic, a benchmark to gaming, a sequel to one of the best games ever made and still one of the highest META rated games in the world.

Half-Life had revolutionary graphics engine, amazing A.I, logical puzzles and an engaging story- nothing like other FPS games that came out before Half-Life. Half-Life won over 50 awards, and is to this date announced as the 'best FPS game ever made'. And Half-Life 2 is the direct sequel to this masterpiece, so it has to live up to its expectations, though cliches with sequels are that they are only made to milk money. THAT is not true with Half-LIfe 2.\n\nNot only Half-Life 2 also had a ground-breaking physics engine called Source, it leaved the 'closed enviorment' atmosphere behind, but used it to make a even better written storyline.\n\nNow, keep in mind that Half-Life 2 was made in 2004. I will be reviewing this game like it came out in 2004, but also as if it came out in modern times.\n\nThe Source engine is still a pretty good engine now, but back then, it was amazing. The signature weapon of the game, the Gravity Gun, was made specifically to show out this new physics. You can't play the original Source engine from 2004 because they updated all games that used the engine to have the updated version from Half-Life 2: Episode 2, so you mostly won't suffer from the engines cons, but back then, the sound engine was terrible for the Source.\n\nThe story continues right where you left off. You were hired by the 'G-Man' because he was impressed at your skills, and put you into stasis untill the time came. Now, it's time to smell the ashes, and Gordon Freeman, the physicist you're contolling, has to join up with the Rebels to fight off the alien 'Combine' forces. The Combine are this galactic federation that enslaves every alien species come by, and puts them as the member of their 'union'. The humans had a 7-hour long war with them, until the UN HQ burnt down and Earth surrendered.\n\nIn Half-Life, the first bit of the game was you trying to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of Black Mesa, the research facility you were working. Then your mission was to save the world from suffering the same misery Black Mesa suffered by killing the invaders' master and ending the invasion. But Gordon was a bit too late, and the invaders found a way out of Black Mesa(which was just teleporting there) before Gordon did. But since Gordon did kill their master, they stopped fighting the humans(except for the non-inteligent ones). Then the Combine came, and this is where you start.\n\nAs the story goes along, the level change drastically. You start at a big city, goes to a canal, a dead town, a coast, a desert, a prison, then back to the city to finally blow up the Citadel, the Combine's base of operations for Earth. While the gameplay doesn't change a lot thoughout the game, the atmosphere do.\n\nNow, the gameplay is nothing special in my book- it's pretty good(or above average depending on your look). You shoot guns to kill people. Though you can use physics against your enemies with your special 'Gravity Gun'. The Gravity Gun allows you to pick up heavy objects and just throw them wherever you wish it to. This can definetely result in some funny moments, and can vary up the gameplay.\n\nThe playtime for Half-Life is much longer then any other FPS games that came out around 2004(Halo 3, Doom 3, Modern Warfare, etc). The average playtime for those games were about 6~8 hours, while Half-Life's playtime is around 8~10 hours. Nothing special compared to modern games(well, actually maybe it is), but still pretty good for a 2004 game.\n\nThe puzzles are back from Half-Life, though this time, a lot of the puzzles are about physics(not because the protagonist is a physicist, but to show off the engine). It involves simple tasks such as moving things to point A to point B, to puzzles like throwing barrels so it makes a bridge(a bit similiar puzzle is from Half-Life: Blue Shift).\n\n\nLet's talk about some miscellaneous stuff. The graphics were good at the time, but by today standards, it's average(even below avarage). The soundtrack is more of the same with Half-Life 1 actually, with some remixes and a few new tracks. It still takes advantage of the ambient themes.\n\nI probably don't even need to make this review any longer- as you may already have noticed, Half-Life 2 is an amazing game. But many people don't go over the cons for the game, and some of them are blantly obvious.\n\nThe A.I. Jesus Christ, the A.I. It's not terrible, but considering Half-Life 1 was revolutionary in its A.I. programming, it was very dissapointing. A good game to compare this is Halo: Combat Evolved. In that game, the enemies flanked you, took defensive positions, etc. While Half-Life 1's A.I. was fantastic at the time, if you compare 1998 with 2004, it's not very different. And Half-Life 2 didn't have much better A.I. then its prequel.(the companions A.I. is a bit improved though)\n\nThe game is really really easy. Really really really. I mean, Half-Life 1 was easy, but this game is just out there. I highly suggest not even touching the 'easy difficulty', A.K.A 'you can't ♥♥♥♥ing die difficulty'. There are also vehicles in the game, and while it's pretty fun, some parts are just fillers. Oh, and the ending is not that good. I also suggest buying the 'Orange Box', which includes Half-Life 2, its episodic sequels(that fills up the dissapointing ending), and a few other really great games.\n\nSo we come down to the verdict. I give Half-Life 2 a solid(not really) 7.7/10. It's a great game, for reals. If Half-Life 1 was what every FPS should aim to be, Half-Life 2 is a bit more meh. While the Source engine is an amazing engine, Half-Life 2 doesn't do enough to really stand out on its own currently in 2015. But eleven years earlier, it was amazing.\n\nOnce again, I highly suggest you to buy the Orange Box, and perhaps Half-Life 1 as well(it's a better game overall except for the story and the graphics). Them, Counter-Strike: Source, and Garry's Mod are a must buy if you're a Steam user.","June 2, 2015","true","111.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is hands down the BEST game ever. Half Life 2 alone is amazing and can be played without the episodes. To take the experience farther you should buy EP 1 and 2. The story of Half Life is awesome but you cant play until you have played Half Life. The first Half Life showed promise in the gaming world and was a very awesome video game. The graphics are OK but for when it was released, they were like next gen graphics. I would personally recommend getting the complete pack to understand everything. I have spent a lot of time playing and I just love it. Half Life was a great game for the 90's. Half Life: Blue Shift was a great addition and showed even more promise. The whole story of Gordon Freeman and the Black Mesa story along with the Combine and the Xen creatures. If you dont have HL2 then I dont know what happened to you. If you dont have it GET IT NOW. I strongly recommend this to everyone.\n\nMarch 6th, 2015\nI just want to note that I was being sarcastic when I said off the charts. It is a GREAT game and has a great storyline with great potential, but it is growing old and outdated. Still, it is a must have for people on Steam and is a great play for the price. Hell, it is barely anything when the sales are on.\nTrue score: 9/10","December 2, 2013","true","84.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I remember when I bought the Orange Box on PS3 I was just amazed! 5 years later replaying it on PC it just adds to the amazing quality of the game. I loved every single second of it and is one my most favorite games of all time. Half Life 2 is a tense, thrilling, and all around amazing game that should be played by everyone.\n\nNOT FOR: People who don't like FPS's. I would still recommend trying it out, but if that's not really your thing, I don't think Half Life 2 would change your mind all that much. However keep in mind that this is more of an old school first person shooter, unlike say Call of Duty. This game doesn't tell you where to go or how to get there, maybe not as much as the original Half-Life, but still a far cry from the crazy hand holding a lot of modern games have today.\n\nFOR: People who want to play or try out a different stlye of FPS. This is not Call of Duty. No constant checkpoints or arrows showing you where to go. While this may prove frustrating for some...(It was for me the first time I tried it.) It proves to be extremely rewarding. On a other note this game doesn't have regenerating health which up's the challenge factor considerably. Even on easy you can every easily die if you don't react fast enough.\n\nIN CONCLUSION: I hope this review finds you well and if you want some other games like Half Life 2, make sure to get it's sequels Episode 1 & 2 . Also try out Portal and Portal 2 as they are in the same universe. (The Portal series is a puzzle game so it's different, but it's in the same story universe.)  Lastly play the originaly it'll be worth it.","January 26, 2014","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

From shooters, to racers, to RPG's to RTS's... It has never been a better time to be a gamer nowadays. The choice we have as gamers is overwhelming, and even though there are a lot of flawed products out there, a lot of great titles make their way into our libraries on an yearly basis. As I see it, video games are divided into three categories: Bad, Decent, and Great, from worse to best.\nBut some games are so unique, different and so many light years ahead of everything else, they don't quite fall under any kind of category. I know a few of these games myself. Half Life 2 is also light years ahead of those games.\n\nHalf Life 2 is an experience. It's almost movie like in it's immersion. I found myself caring about the protagonist, Gordon Freeman, my allies Alyx and Eli Vance, Dr Mossman and Dr K, in the fight against the fascist alien race known as the combine. I found myself caring about every little detail of what happened to them, and to my surprise, I have never felt this happy, sad and angry while playing a video game. It truly is an experience.\n\nI won't spoil the story to anyone, but it is by far, and in my opinion, the best story ever put into the video game form, for what it tells you, for what you have to figure out for yourself, and for the most intriguing and misterious character to ever grace a PC game (or any game for that matter): The G-man. When you play this game, you will know exactly what I am talking about.\n\nGameplay is varied, and the controls are close to perfection. You will walk and shoot like an FPS, drive a boat and buggy. The common link between them is the fact they are seamless and feel like you are on a true quest, no section is out of place and they are all extremely well done. The concept of levels isn't quite present, as the game world feels like a whole.\n\nHalf life 2 is an amazing accomplishment. It is the proof that games can be art, and can rival Hollywood in story telling. Make no mistake, Half Life 2 is in my opinion, the best game ever made, and worth every penny and minute you put into it. It is a rewarding experience like no other, and there are almost no games who can even compare to it. A timeless masterpiece.\n\nThe Good\n\nExtremely fun to play\nGroundbreaking story\nEnemy AI\nShooting mechanics\nVaried gameplay\n\nThe Bad\n\nNothing I can think of, it really is that good, and as close to perfection as you will ever get.\n\n10/10 - Legendary","December 5, 2013","true","22.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DT_76/recommended/220/","DT_76","DT76","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DT_76/","62 products in account","In some ways, this is a very old-fashioned FPS.  You have a variety of weapons, but can only hold so much ammo.   When you pick up stuff (by touching it), it adds those bullets/health to your supplies if you have any missing, and any excess is lost.  Carrying around health packs/extra ammo is impossible.  You still progress through a bunch of areas, needing to press the right button or trigger the right event to proceed.\nWhat sets it apart is the obvious polish, quality design, and good story.  The game uses only in-engine cinematics, and never takes over the player's camera.  It counts on you to observe the world around you, take an interest in the environment, and solve the various physics puzzles.\n\nInstead of just a bunch of corridors and enemies (though it has those, too), it focuses on small engagements, then big set-piece battles.  You'll play for a while in one setting on foot, then switch to a more vehicle-oriented bit, then a new mechanic is introduced, then it kind of repeats those 3, etc.  This varies up the gameplay and keeps introducing fresh concepts through little in-game tutorials.\n\nAbout the only complaint I had is that the game wants you to be immersed in its world, and use their impressive physics engine to solve puzzles.  It wants you to approach the obstacles as if you were actually there, making use of the objects around you to get past them.  This is great when it works, like making use of plastic barrels' buoyancy to get past one spot, but then you get to points where you try out a solution over and over, convinced it should be working, and it won't.  Oh, it should work, because it seems obvious, and because it totally would work in the real world, but in the game they want you to do something else pre-scripted, and until you figure out what that thing is, you're not going anywhere.  They make you stack boxes & crates in several spots to climb up/over things, but try it in the wrong place and you'll hit an invisible wall.  There's one area where you have to get past an electric fence and can see the power cable running above you.  Even though you've got a way to hurl nice big, sharp, wide saw blades with great speed and accuracy, you can't sever that cable.  No amount of shooting will help, either.  That cable's not a solid object, it's just there to let you know where to go to hit the switch that you need to find in order to turn off the fence.\nDespite a few tired elements and some minor breaks in the immersion, this is one hell of a game.","July 7, 2014","true","21.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Later, their population overloaded and Black Mesa became instable, which drived to the attention of the Combine army. Soon after the alien species population was at peak, the Combines took over the city.\n\nIn the game, you first start out in the train station, where the mysterious G-Man transported you. After that, you reunite with your Lambda buddies: Barney, Alyx, Kleiner, and Eli. You try to teleport to Eli's lab, but the teleportation fails. After that, you're on your own.\n\nThe main plot is that you are trying to exterminate the vicious and abusive Combine army to bring the entire city and the world back in place. But, you must go through a series of trials to avoid any direct contact with any Combine army (like a series of Combines)\n\nIn general, this game is just downright amazing. The graphics are great for its age, it brings a realistic feel, and the AI is spectacularly done in such detail I can't even describe.\n\nThe gameplay is superior and more fluent compared to other games of that time, which makes it WAY ahead of its time. Even though there were other games released around that time like CS:S which has been critically acclaimed for its graphics, HL2's is FAR better; light years better.\n\nThe realism is just... REAL! It actually makes you feel like that you are Gordon Freeman and it brings strong visuals to your brain what it would look like if you were actually stuck in Gordon's situation.\n\nI'm so glad I actually forked out only $10 for the best PC game of all time. Ever since I got it, I've been EXTREMELY addicted to this game. I can't even believe I just started playing it three days ago! This game is a fun one, and it runs over the word "fun" and turns it into "extremely convivial." How about you guys pick this game up, and prepare to have the best time in your life! This game will fill a big gap in your game brain, like 80 percent of it.\n\nPrepare to be amazed at what Valve did here!\n\n10.0, 100/100","January 17, 2014","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
