This game contains 100 levels that may seem easy at first, but some of them can be difficult, providing you rather quite a challenge. The way you play is that you move your mouse to the left or right to rotate the screen for the marble to move in order to get from point A to point B.\n\nBut it's not something as simple as getting from point A to point B, you also have to maneuver through obstacles that comes your way. You would have to avoid hitting spikes that exists in some levels and falling down too far to the point the marble shatters. The levels shouldn't be too difficult, but if you don't succeed, try try again!\n\nThe graphics and the game interface aren't really the best, but not like it really matters. Oh and there's trading cards too if you want to craft more badges.\n\nShould you buy this game? If you're just looking for a casual game, like 2D puzzles, or just wanting to make more badges from trading cards, then yes. Just give it a shot anyways! :)\n\n6/10\n","October 18, 2015","true","2.4"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","46","52","0","0"

Minor changes in the review for the points for hard mode.\nLets start off with the positives.\nIt's an interesting gimmick, and he designed most levels around that pretty well.\nIt's a pretty difficult platformer, and has a wide variety levels, and even a difficulty select, for the masochists and the causals.....I think those are the only good things you can say about this game.\nNegatives. Where to begin?\nThe level design and choice of gimmicks is terrible. (I know I just complimented the level design. That was only refering to the design and combination of some gimmicks. The level design is not designed for Hard Mode AT ALL, and that itself shows how little effort was put into Hard Mode.) Every level that has 360¬∞ rotation on it you can find a way to cheese by abusing the game's physics to no end.\nThe difficulty balance is atrocious. There can be free and easy levels all the way in the 80s, and compared to Level 83 and 84? Those easy levels should belong back in the 20s and 30s.\nThe rotation gimmick is poorly done. It just doesn't work with the physics engine.\nOh, the physics engine is sickening, combined with the rotation, you're going to get a headache from playing this game.\nThe physics engine allows you to clip through platforms by going a specific speed. How did nobody find this bug?\nThere's no indicator of where the level end is on some levels. So you basically have to just roll around forever and if possible, abuse the physics engine to find it.\nHard Mode is just speeding up the game to no end.\nHard Mode took me 3 times longer to beat than the normal mode. Hard Mode unlocks nothing new in the game, in spite of the store page saying it has "100" levels, it still only has 85.\nHard Mode is not a challenge of skill. It's a challenge of patience and luck.\nOverall I would definitely not recommend this game to anybody.","October 18, 2015","false","24.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

As the title says, the ball is very fragile. Falling from a certain height can lead to your utter destruction. The physics of the game is very good. The puzzles are well-designed. There maybe times that the challenges are very easy but there will also be moments that you'll get frustrated on how hard the puzzle is. The graphics are okay but don't judge this game by the way it looks. The gameplay is simple yet challenging. A combination of speed manipulation, timing, patience and focus is needed depending on the given puzzle.\n\nIf you like difficult and challenging games then this is the game for you. I recommend it that you buy it during a sale because this game is just a casual minigame for me and minigames, in my opinion, should not cost too much.\n\nPersonal Rating:Gameplay: 7/10\nGraphics: 5/10\nMusic: 5/10\nStory/Plot: n/a\n\nOverall: 5/10","October 11, 2015","true","2.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","10","15","4","0"

Fragile Ball is basic 2D 'marble' game of skill, with one simple goal of using gravity to get your ball to the exit, while avoiding the inevitable traps. Certainly sounds simple, but in practice its one hell of a challenge!\n\nHard is perhaps an understatement. Level design plays a big role in this, with plenty of hazards to avoid, placed in just the right spots to have you pulling out your hair. Some level design reminded me of the old classic, Crazy Machines, where one small incorrect move and it all falls apart in milliseconds, followed by a swift restart while you mumble to yourself that you can do better. There are also other levels though that are more open/scrolling, but regardless of the level type the restarts will be many! It can be brutal .. I found myself swearing & groaning at my screen on more than one occasion. I do enjoy a challenge though; something that takes practice.\n\nWith the high level of difficulty, I find this game is best suited to short sessions. 5-10mins over a coffee in the morning is good to wake the brain up. If I get stuck for too long, I stop to prevent the frustration building.\n\nAlong with more 'standard' levels previously mentioned, there are also some maze levels to challenge you. These are generally bigger levels allowing a larger degree rotation. Standard levels generally limit the range of angle you can choose giving more of a fixed direction - but this does vary quite a bit. Graphics are rather bland, along with animations and menus, but they do the job.\n\nAlthough I do like the game overall, there are a few things that bugged me that I think could be improved upon. The mouse sensitivity has a limited range on the slider. With my Logitech mouse & slider all the way down, the movement still was too sensitive for my liking. This restricted the precision over the ball, but on reflection I can't be 100% sure if its just the mouse sensitivity or harsh physics in the game design.\n\nAlso found the maze levels when run in full screen made me feel nauseous. The spinning speed (and almost constant spinning sometimes), particularly when view full screen gave me some motion sickness. In a smaller screen (you can play in windowed mode) it was ok for me. Something to warn people about if they are sensitive to such things. Most levels were ok, but a few were tough to deal with.\n\nRunning in window mode was a bit problematic as well, as the mouse didn't lock to the game screen. I would move my mouse too far & it would flick back to windows, killing control over the ball.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this to everyone (some will just find it infuriating!). It's not the best example I have seen in the genre with some flaws, but you are a gamer with patience & persistence, who likes a hardcore challenge then this is a good value puzzler to add to your collection.\n\n\nDisclosure: Copy of this game was provide for review purposes.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","October 14, 2015","true","2.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","2"

I'm currently half way through having completed 50 levels, and it is what it is in the moment - so not very memorable. The short marble traveling maps will ask for a little of your brain power while simultaneously testing and probably pushing your frustration and rage meter into overload as you hear the sound of an exploding ball ringing in your ears. Luck often brings an end to a level if not some extremely careful mouse control, and there is a feel of wanting more reward for your efforts of completion. There are short won moments of elation until you suddenly fill with dread at the thought of the next marble madness challenge.

It is also just as efficient as it needs to be, because it is a really simple game. If you are looking for a good time with a cheap, unique game, this is it.

The issue comes in that there are sets of levels I would refer to as "poorly designed".They're trial and error machines with no hints or ability to solve them short of flinging yourself to death on the course repeatedly. Examples would be multiple which start you at a high point, then give you a left or right direction to fall in. For one thing, the game's title is spot-on: your ball is fragile and tapping ANYTHING over a certain velocity will kill you**, so if you pick the wrong path: bam, dead. Alright, but then what happens when a level is nothing but left/right paths where you have to memorize which is correct and which isn't? Or a single left/right fall but one side has a cushion at the bottom to catch you (which you need to aim for precisely, those ain't big) and the other doesn't. And you have to blind-aim your momentum to land on something that's way off screen.\n\nI hope you're beginning to get my point here.\n\nBut at the other end of the scale, there are stages which create some really fun challenges, where you have a full 360-degree playfield and you're working your momentum in platforming you don't see in anything else, managing momentum and angle of rotation and trying to find the exit before you can even maneuver down to it. When the game gives you the freedom in a stage to approach it however you like, it really takes off for a few minutes at a time.\n\nAlso, I feel this needs to be stated: this game is ugly as sin, consisting of nothing but stock textures used over and over in eye-searing ways. I think there are under 10 textures in the entire game, and sometimes they will be backgrounds, sometimes foregrounds, and usually in clashing, jarring fashion.\n\n* I presume there are 100 levels. Where I'm currently at, around 15 tiles on a 100-tile board refuse to open up, whether I clear things adjacent to them or not.\n** Except in "Super Ball" stages. These are poorly designed for other reasons, because you're invincible to physics damage in them, but basically controlling rubber and a lot of them involve precision-landings above hazard fields and slowing your momentum. It's not fun at all.","October 30, 2015","false","4.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Games, that despite playing each level multiple times, remain to keep the player hooked.\n\nMarble Mayhem: Fragile Ball is definatly a hard game, but not a very good one. The controls are bad, the visuals are bad, and even the repeating music and sound effects get annoying after a while. There is no insentive to keep playing the levels, because all that awaits you are more of the same.\n\nIn conclusion, if all you are looking for is a hard game, then you may like Marble Mayhem.

The courses begin to vary after ten levels with some looking like a pachinko board, or a classic maze of sorts. Tilting the whole level is limited per level sometimes you can go a full 360 other times the rotation is limited to maybe as little as ten degrees.\n\nAlso you‚Äôre not always playing with the fragile ball there are also levels with the bouncy ball.

Sometimes you get a fragile ball that will shatter if it hits anything too hard. Sometimes you get a blue bouncy ball that doesn't shatter but bounces more. Sometimes there are cannons you can enter to be propelled out. Spacebar or left clicking will reset your puzzle for you. There is a normal and hard mode. I tried the normal mode and found some puzzles to be very easy and some very challenging. So far I have done 13 of the 100 levels available. Between each puzzle you are treated to a 10x10 grid where you can select the next puzzle. Each completed puzzle unlocks one or two nearby squares much like the old MicroSoft game, Minesweeper. I have not encountered any bugs, glitches, DRM, or errors.\n\nThere are three sets of options:\nVideo Options: Fullscreen toggle, Anti-aliasing toggle, Video Resolution 640x480 800x600 1024x768 1280x800, V-sync toggle\nSound Options: Background music volume slider bar, Sound Effect volume slider bar\nControl Options: Rotation Speed slider bar\nHere is a gameplay video of it (sorry about the quality): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR0R1MWd1zU\nnot available on linux.","October 11, 2015","true","5.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Thats it here and more. The ball is super fragile like glass and breaks on you, if it hits a side too hard or falls to hard OR the ball is super bouncy like a 25 cents super ball from the grocery store. That makes this game a huge challange when going through mazes and lybrinths and PLATFORMS( witch I hate) spikes, cannons, crushers, slopes and makes this game a very hard challange to complete. A good game for the puzzle lovers out there. Just takes patience, timing and good mouse control.

Regardless of whether I paid for it or not, I remain unbiased in all of my reviews.

"Devilishly difficult" sounds more like an excuse for terrible game design. It's not challenging gameplay, it's terrible physics. Yeah sure the levels are "diverse" I'll give it that, but it's far from "ingenius". The music is generic and even annoying at times. The textures are drab, blurry, and just plain hard to look at at times. It's really unfair to compare it to Super Monkey Ball, Marble Madness, and Peggle.

What few innovative and fun level designs there are end up buffered by godawful slogs through finnicky trial-and-error abominations of level design.\n\nTextures are limited and dull. One of the primary backgrounds is a brick wall with even lines; seeing it twist around and around enough times will make the hardiest stomach roll.\n\nWhile the game itself -can- be fun if you're the type who likes punishing games, the music is... Well, awful. The longest track (out of the whopping three available) is 36 seconds. I just checked it. And you'll hear them over, and over, and over again as you try to complete the unreasonable levels. The sounds are serviceable, nothing more or less, but you will quickly find grating the sounds of your ball being spiked and cracked. And when you do by some miracle finish a level, farty trumpets salute you.\n\nOn the gameplay side of things, I've already mentioned how rage-inducing this title is, but it's the contrivances that make it so horrible. I can understand that dropping my ball too far makes it shatter, and similarly, letting it be crushed is also an acceptable way to lose. A glass ball being destroyed by touching spikes? From the side, even? That's harder to swallow. But the award for most ridiculous obstacle goes to the water. You let a drop of water hit that ball and you're starting over, baby. That's just a trolling game designer as far as I'm concerned.\n\nThe controls work, but muscle memory might screw you over. You can turn the screen (your only method of making the ball move) with the arrow keys, but the mouse is basically the way to go. However, the sensitivity is off the charts, and you'll most often destroy your ball by overcompensating and twisting the opposite direction of what you intended. Left click resets you to the beginning of the stage, which is an outright sin against gaming. I don't need to explain why that's a terrible decision.\n\nOverall, this isn't worth the 2$ it costs. I think I paid 50 cents for it on sale, and it's only -just- worth that much. This game isn't much of anything but a time-waster, and a frustrating one at that.","January 12","false","3.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I spent way too much time for the game and this wasnt good for me but it is THE BEST GAME ever made so i had to decide to stop playng this game or just leafe the school. So i made the better choice to stay with the game. Now i earn much money playing this game in livestreams and i am able to buy me everything i want but all i need is just this game something to eat and a littlebit cola to survive my days.\nNow you maby thing why i like this game soo much and here is the awnser: There are many levels and it doesnt matter how often i play these it still looks differend from the last try. If you have nice aim some reaction and a good knowedge of the level you can easyly play at the ESL and the support of ESL is just awsome just write them that you are a Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball pro and they will take you to many differend tournaments. The prices of this tournaments are awsome and you have many viewers who hope that they can be as good as you one day but the wont because for being as good as you they need to play this game or to cheat.\nAnd this is the only problem of the game the CHEATS. There are so many cheaters out there and they are able to fly around and win every tournament and because this game has no VAC the makers of the tournament cant do anything against this :( but it is still the game which made me famous and which is my life forevery.\n\nPeace and out my friends","December 19, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I gave it about 20 minutes and got through 12 or so levels - while they were challenging and fun - the way the screen tilts with the board made me wish I was near a toilet while playing.\n\nGraphics are okay for the genre - pushing towards realism, but in reality the game would have been acceptable with black lines and a white ball instead of going for the full 3D rendered effects.\n\nControls are done with the left and right motion of the mouse, or with the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard. I don't know about controller support, but regardless you could probably macro a controller to work with this game no problem.\n\nAudio was loud and horrible. Had to mute the audio to play the game.\n\nGameplay itself is simple. Each level has a restriction as to how far you can tilt each "board" and you need to navigate the marble/ball from start to finish. An added feature for failure is if the ball falls from too far of a height, it breaks - forcing you to restart the level. As an added bonus, there are various traps in each level to amp up the difficulty of a board. From what I saw, spikes were a common occurance, and jets of flame were another that lay in wait to disrupt your progress.\n\nAll in all, the game would have been enjoyable if it didn't make me sick trying to play it. Challenging? Yes, but not worth the feeling of wanting to stick my head down a porcelain basin.","February 10","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game contains 100 levels that may seem easy at first, but some of them can be difficult, providing you rather quite a challenge. The way you play is that you move your mouse to the left or right to rotate the screen for the marble to move in order to get from point A to point B.\n\nBut it's not something as simple as getting from point A to point B, you also have to maneuver through obstacles that comes your way. You would have to avoid hitting spikes that exists in some levels and falling down too far to the point the marble shatters. The levels shouldn't be too difficult, but if you don't succeed, try try again!\n\nThe graphics and the game interface aren't really the best, but not like it really matters. Oh and there's trading cards too if you want to craft more badges.\n\nShould you buy this game?\nIf you're just looking for a casual game, like 2D puzzles, or just wanting to make more badges from trading cards, then yes. Just give it a shot anyways! :)\n\n6/10","October 24, 2015","true","21.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The well implemented physics and simple intuitive controls makes this game effortless to play. You don't have to learn how to play this game, just just jump right in and play from the first second.\nI would recommend this game as a good game for children as it is easy to learn, fun and a play session can be anything from just a few minutes to longer sittings.","October 22, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gave the game an awesome new dimension! Love the creativity with a simple concept devs! I dunno, but the 3D text was something different from lots of other games! Just reached level 26. And I'm inpressed once again. Raindrops fall with the direction you're pointing at! Ball does break when it comes between a moving platform and a wall, just tested (acidentally)!\n\nSome things that annoyed me however are the transitions of music, the sudden stops of the ball when breaking. So, transitions. Oh, and sometimes the ball has a crack, but doesn't break, then the crack dissapears and i can just continue. It's the little things you know...\n\nI am overall impressed by the game. Expected it to be a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• indie game that I'd play once,but this was way more fun then i expected! So, to all of you reading this game. It might not be the best graphics, but the gameplay is pretty fun!\n\nTL;DR: It's like that phone game, Labyrynth 2, but the ball can break.","October 15, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game mechanic makes Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball a VERY hard game, but it stays very addictive.\n\nThe game has Steam cards, which is a GOOD thing.\n\nThe soundtrack is calm and it fits well with the game. I especially love the level select song myself.\n\nGraphics are alright. Who needs great HD extreme graphics in a puzzle game anyways? :3\n\nControls are responsive, and it uses the arrows keys or the mouse to rotate the level. It plays very smooth with the mouse, and smoothness in a marble game is very important.\n\n\nI have one complaint: No level editor. I mean, with how simple the game is, a level editor for it would be very easy to make and to use. And I want to be honest here: I WISH THERE WAS A LEVEL EDITOR. This game is just so good, a level editor would make it PERRRRRRRRRRRRRFECT. A way to share levels by other users (Workshop) would be great too if a level editor feature ever happens.\n\n\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game.

I gave it about 20 minutes and got through 12 or so levels - while they were challenging and fun - the way the screen tilts with the board made me wish I was near a toilet while playing.\n\nGraphics are okay for the genre - pushing towards realism, but in reality the game would have been acceptable with black lines and a white ball instead of going for the full 3D rendered effects.\n\nControls are done with the left and right motion of the mouse, or with the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard. I don't know about controller support, but regardless you could probably macro a controller to work with this game no problem.\n\nAudio was loud and horrible. Had to mute the audio to play the game.\n\nGameplay itself is simple. Each level has a restriction as to how far you can tilt each "board" and you need to navigate the marble/ball from start to finish. An added feature for failure is if the ball falls from too far of a height, it breaks - forcing you to restart the level. As an added bonus, there are various traps in each level to amp up the difficulty of a board. From what I saw, spikes were a common occurance, and jets of flame were another that lay in wait to disrupt your progress.\n\nAll in all, the game would have been enjoyable if it didn't make me sick trying to play it. Challenging? Yes, but not worth the feeling of wanting to stick my head down a porcelain basin.","February 10","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know about controller support, but regardless you could probably macro a controller to work with this game no problem.\n\nAudio was loud and horrible. Had to mute the audio to play the game.\n\nGameplay itself is simple. Each level has a restriction as to how far you can tilt each "board" and you need to navigate the marble/ball from start to finish. An added feature for failure is if the ball falls from too far of a height, it breaks - forcing you to restart the level. As an added bonus, there are various traps in each level to amp up the difficulty of a board. From what I saw, spikes were a common occurance, and jets of flame were another that lay in wait to disrupt your progress.\n\nAll in all, the game would have been enjoyable if it didn't make me sick trying to play it. Challenging? Yes, but not worth the feeling of wanting to stick my head down a porcelain basin.","February 10","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Second of all, the game isn't hard because of level design, no, its hard because of bad controls, and the amount you can fall from without dying is stupid. Fall about 1 inch on your monitor, and you die. You want a hard game? Buy Hotline Miami. 100% better.","December 2, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReikanFurrow/recommended/370510/","ReikanFurrow","Reikan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReikanFurrow/","127 products in account","Have you ever dreamed of rolling a frustratingly delicate ball around garbage maps made from the clearance section of your local Home Depot, all while listening to music that wouldn't be out of place in that weird Italian restaurant no one ever ate at but inconspicuously stayed open all through your childhood (You know the one, the parking lot was always empty save for that one car that never moved)? Well boy golly, have I got good news for you! Your dreams can come true today, yes all that I mentioned above, with the added bonus of the ball being so fragile you could swear it‚Äôs made from the purest of frozen orphan tears. Now I know, you're probably exhilarated, but contain your enthusiasm, because there's more. The engine has almost no concept of friction, so the slightest twitch sends that little ball flying through the air like a majestic, infuriating eagle, almost certain to detonate on impact when it lands a mere 15 inches away. The lack of friction is especially rewarding when the level has tiny, moving platforms, which require you to have the hand dexterity of a Himalayan Monk.\n\nSeriously though, if you're into really difficult, repetitive puzzles/mazes/pachinko-with-the-added-threat-of-death type roll the ball games, this game can actually be pretty fun. Aesthetically, it looks like a demo for a game that's still in development, with textures and level design being reused so frequently the deja-vu gave me a concussion. The font is reminiscent of a Chuck E Cheese pizza menu only instead of a birthday party with that cool tube-gym with that awesome twisty slide you get pain and a chance to try out those cool curse words you‚Äôve been waiting to use.\n\n6/10, would suggest waiting until its on-sale","June 2","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
