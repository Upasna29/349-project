Similar to Virtual Villagers, the refugees will gather resources, build homes, marry, and have children of their own. Your overall goal is to help this society rebuild their teleporter and return home. It proves to be an engaging quest with a surprising amout of objectives and puzzles along the way.","March 17, 2013","true","6.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Also contains the only known example of a non-frustrating sliding block puzzle.","September 23, 2014","true","8.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Only a few hours long, but cutely entertaining while it lasts.","October 6, 2012","true","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're looking for something you can play on the side while doing laundry, reading a book etc. you may like this.  It requires a bit of supervising if only to make sure people get married, have kids and those who are sick get treated.","December 28, 2011","true","9.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has a very charming style that keeps you cemented in your seat. It's a very casual game but it has a way of motivating you to go further. It reminds me of the days when I played Farmville for some reason. Anyway, this is one simulation/management game that you don't want to miss!","September 6, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
