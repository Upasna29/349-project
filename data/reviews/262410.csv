"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/recommended/262410/","zerathos","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/","1102 products in account","I remember at first picking this up on a whim, doing a couple guns, then putting it down for a long while and not really seeing the point. A few months later I decided to pick it up again and put some actual effort into bringing down my times and working on expanding my view of the map, and that was when I got hooked. The first time I managed to take first place on the daily leaderboards was a great feeling, and soon I started to get a feel for the general patterns of the mechanisms, like how similar the CZ-75 and Jericho pistols were internally, which helped decrease my times on both guns as I learned them. I learned that the Colt Walker is easy to take apart quickly, and whoever made the MG 34 can go to hell. Each gun had their own similarities and differences that were fun to figure out and optimize for the best times. Eventually I completed the whole map that could be done without paying (and I even got a couple of the premium guns from credits earned being the champion on different guns).\n\nAnyway, now that I've rambled for a bit, the point I'm making is that this is a fairly satisfying F2P experience. You don't really need to put in any money to enjoy yourself, and frankly the real money options seem to not have the greatest value. Just expect to log in once every hour or so and learn every gun on the map so you can do the quizzes. You should be able to manage at least 3,000 experience every time once you learn them, and depending on how actively you want to log in and do the quizzes, can rack up enough virtual currency to unlock a gun or two every day. It'll probably take you a month or two to unlock everything, and keep in mind you can buy things that are locked behind premium guns through the catalog at an increased price. If you're good enough to earn credits to buy some of those guns, strategically pick the SVD first to maximize the amount of stuff hidden being uncovered if you want to lower the cost.\n\nIn summary, for the price of free this game is worth your attention if you like challenging the leaderboards and don't mind investing some time in the quiz system to get the currency to buy guns. It probably helps if you like guns too.\n\nUpdate:I feel it's worth noting that virtually every single gun added to the game since I originally wrote this review has required premium currency to purchase. Whereas before you could own nearly every single gun in the game without paying a cent, and good play could earn you a couple more of the paid guns for free, now such a large portion of the guns require premium currency that it's forced me to revise my assessment somewhat.\n\nThere's still a hundred or so free guns that I expect will remain free, but once you've burned through those, don't expect to be able to continue to enjoy the game as a free player. Of course, you can always go back to guns you do own to refine your times, but there will eventually come a point at which you've done about as much repetition on the same guns as you care to. My suggestion would be to play through as much as you can as a free player (which is still a fair amount of content), then decide if you want to put money into the game. If you do, wait for the lifetime access DLC to go on sale. It'll be more economical in the long run than trying to buy each gun as they come out. You could spend $10 to get the 100 credit pack and not be able to buy all the premium guns available now. So if you can find the lifetime access on sale for 50% off or more (currently retails for $50), that's probably a good deal if you intend to put serious time into the game.","October 26, 2014","true","61.9"," 326 of 337 people (97%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","97","326","337","36","8"

YOU  NEED A HAMMER AND A  10 TON PRESS BARE MINIMUM FOR THAT JOB! they are NOT even  considered  general purpouse armorer removable parts... gunsmith/OEM  factory instalation job, ONLY !\n\nAnd it can be  "picky" about what it considers to be  "unitized parts" ...OOHHH so the  trigger , trigger spring and trigger linkage bar of a IWI MK VII .44 Magnum Desert Eagle is  a  unitized part which needs no disassembly, even though  it  was sold under 3 seperate SKU numbers   while   the safety assembly  of a  ( MISMARKED AS A CENTURION, MIND YOU!)

Because of its origin, and the fact that its free, unlocking stuff involves lot of grinding for experience points, which means assembling and disassembling same weapons over and over again. To unlock guns you only need XP, but for shooting range you need XP and you also got to send friend invites! Alternatively you can skip these requirements with credits, which can be earned with most difficult achievements, but even that can be skipped with, you guessed it, microtransactions! Buy credits or unlock stuff with real money.\n\nBut the question is, is it worth playing? The idea is really cool and if guns are your thing then yeah, go for it. The detail is excellent and it should satisfy the curiosity for those who want to know more on how guns work. However, lot of people will probably get turned off by the excessive amount of grinding and pay-2-unlock mechanics before they get to the guns they might actually be interested in. The game goes really anti-grind already after you've unlocked MP5, as the required experience to unlock the next guns keeps increasing and you earn less the amount of XP when you repeat old one's. I'd love to fool around with something like that Gatling Gun seen in the pictures, but I probably don't have time or patience to tear down the same bloody AK again, again and again, especially when I have better games to play which are actual full experiences.","May 21, 2014","false","1.4"," 644 of 869 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","644","869","0","27"

It’s more like an ABC of guns that everyone would like to have at home. Sure, it would be more interesting to have all those guns at home stored in a special place but if you have a very special need to take a closer look at the weapons of all kinds but at the same time want to be safe or simply can’t afford the arsenal – World of Guns Gun Disassembly is your savior.World of Guns Gun Disassembly is a decent and more than successful attempt to create affordable and deep encyclopedia of guns. But not just a virtual book with boring descriptions and history. Well, not that we do not like history, but all that information is available on the web already. We also have tons of videos and tutorials on how to use guns, assemble and dissemble them and how to fire the proper way. But, have you ever seen an application that would allow you to get inside the gun, see how it actually works and assemble or dissemble the favorite rifle with your own hands?To your surprise – World of Guns Gun Disassembly is exactly this kind of software.Once you got your gun chosen, start playing with it. At first it looks like a simple 3D room where you can take a look at the gun from all sides. However, in just a few seconds it turns into something unpredictably catchy.Everything you do is accompanied with simple but nice animation. In World of Guns Gun Disassembly your task is to dissemble or assembly a gun in a certain order. Don’t be afraid – it follows the rules of logic, so even if you have no idea what to do next – start dealing with the most complicated part of the mechanism. In the end you will either appear with lots of gun elements floating in the air or a fully loaded pistol/rifle/shotgun after making it one solid construction from all that stuff.It’s a great thing that you can train your memory by completing challenges both ways. Not only it gives you a better understand of guns but also allows to be more aware of all the small things. I would say it’s a perfect virtual helper for young soldiers and those who want to improve their knowledge in guns.Despite incredible attention to the details, World of Guns Gun Disassembly also has an X-ray mode where you can see what’s inside the gun and how the mechanisms work without tearing it apart.On the top of all the greatness, you can also equip your guns with various accessories and see how they work.  Flashlight, optics and lasers – they all are here and look different on every gun.World of Guns Gun Disassembly includes all the possible weapons starting from ages ago and going up to the modern and popular models. World of Guns is a wonderful experience.","January 1, 2015","true","26.7"," 93 of 107 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","93","107","4","0"

Gameplay is surprisingly engaging. I found myself trying to optimize ways to strip and reassemble the guns to get the fastest time. It's pretty cool they managed to make gun maintenance fun in a video game.\n\nCons: A few...\n\n1. Poor performance. Even on a 4670k and R9 295x2 the game will still occasionally crawl to a halt and stutter. This is probably the fault of the Unity engine.\n2. Ridiculously long tutorial that still somehow manages to not explain things very well.\n3. Incosistent on what parts are grouped into assemblies and which are counted individually. Sometimes you have to remove individual pins/screws, other times you don't.\n\nNow the big problems:\n\n4. Free2Play mechanics. The game is set up so that completing every game mode and getting most/all of the achievements for a gun will give you just barely enough XP to unlock the next gun. You essentially have to grind each gun until you can do it fast enough to get enough XP to progress. They then offer expensive "boosters" and DLC to help you progress faster. No thanks.\n\n5. (Final straw) The shooting range mode is apparently totally broken. I unlocked the 1911 shooting range and after a couple tries managed to complete all of the challenges. However the game did not recognize this at all, and when I returned to the map my >4000 XP had disappeared and I was at 0 XP.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/262410/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","World of Guns is a game about disassembling guns, as simple as that. Practically, this product has one of the clearest headers in the whole market.\nBasically, there are many (priced) products theming disassembling things. Most famous on Steam are the Surgeon Simulator 2013 and the Car Mechanic Simulator 2014/15. Both of those aren't giving you any real knowledge, just some queery "fun moments".\nWorld of Guns is very different. Generally, it's not much of a game. It's not about fun. Of course, if only you're not the one seeing fun when you don't lose any screws while disassembling something. Most likely, it feels as a big manual on "how to operate with guns". And that is a good thing. You can find many books, pictures, videos on "how to keep the gun", but you don't get it unless you'll try it by yourself, even if in 3d model (yeah, like those in ikea shops).\n\nIt has its flaws, sure. If you want a manual to specific weapon from list, you have to pay for it - or to get it by achieving "points". You can collect those points for practicing with already unlocked stuff and answering some quiz to unlock next weapon closer to one you want... Over and over, until you'll get them all. And yeah, if it sounds grindy to you, that's because it is.\nAlso, while you not only be playing with screws there - there will be some ranges to shoot, some paints to make your dream gun if you like them coloured... that's not all you can hope for from a weapons "Hustler" game. For example, if you were wandering not only how those irons disassemble and blazing, but how to oil them... alas, there are no such useful info.\n\nSo! People doesn't like to see a price in F2P game for quick access to something that could be opened later for free. People don't like "grinding". And even if they are alright with F2P gaming basics, the game itself is not like a wet dream for a gun ate-ups, as there are not so much content, as one can imagine... and new additions comes not so fast.\n\nStill, it is quite a good project. Even if it's just 3d models and not real iron, it's much, Much better than nothing. I can only hope it could be improved to become something greater. Like the "Jane's" magazines in the XX century.\n\nThere will be no usual mark 'cause it's not a game you'll play to enjoy.

Not the "Surgeon Simulator" kind of simulation but a rather realistic one. The developers of the game took their time to good use finding information and blueprints on different weapons. They then created and animated the parts. What you do in the game is disassemble and then reassemble them in varying detail. You start of with two weapons after the tutorial. The AK-47 and the Colt M1911. You can partially assemble them (Field Strip), fully disassemble them, assemble them, watch them shoot in great detail (X-ray Cam, Cutout, Slow Motion) and finally "Play" with them. There are 2 game modes. The simple one, where you disassemble and reassemble the gun as fast as you can, which can be done competetively against others via leaderboards and the "advanced" game mode where you do the same only that when you try to assemble/disassemble parts that can not logically be moved it restarts completely, forcing you to remember how to correctly assemble each of the guns. It should be noted that you only click on parts to interact with them. You will not use any tools or choose where to put the parts yourself, that is something that the game does for you.\n\nThe game features an unlock System. You can unlock new weapons with XP. XP are gained by earning achievements for each weapon (Finishing each game mode / disassemble and reassemble in a certain time etc.) or simply by "playing." It is not all that easy to unlock all achievements and it will make you grind to unlock most weapons, which is totally reasonable since that is what the game is there for. It teaches you realistically to actually disassemble and reassemble those guns. Learning their parts and the process of assembling them by heart.\n\nThis naturally should tell you that this isn't a game for anyone but gun enthusiasts. If you have no interest in guns or disassembling them, not once but over and over again repeatedly then this is not a game for you.\n\nNow that you know what the game is about, is it any good?\n\nIt's a good game in my book. As a long time german shooting club member (implying I already did disassemble some of the handguns also in the game) I can, at least for some of those guns, tell you that they are very detailed and correctly represented.\n\nMy only concern is that the developers seemingly weren't all that consistent when creating some of the guns. Sometimes removing a single bolt is an action you have to perform and sometimes the bolts and the part that they hold in place are handled in the same action.\n\nLastly, the game is free to play. You are free to try it and if you actually do get sick of unlocking you can also buy the guns.\n\nSo, if you think that you are within the target audience of this game, feel free to try it. I enjoy it a lot.","June 5, 2014","true","91.9"," 47 of 60 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","47","60","0","7"

This game will absorb all of your freetime!\n\nJust kidding! Don't worry guys, although I'm on here nearly everyday, it not too addictive.\n\nIt is however a very fun and educational program about firearms, and its FREE! However, I will admit, for extreme gun gurus, this game may be dissapointing for its somewhat watered down approach to firearms dissassembly. When I got this, I was thinking "AWESOME", finally a game that will help me figure out how to dissassemble my AR without getting shot in face the with the Action Spring! However, it turns out there is no in-depth explaination of the dissassembly process for any weapon.\n\nActually, the game is more about raw step-by-step memorization than anything . . . . Although you will be able to see every single firearms 100% dissassembled, and learn whice pieces need to be screwed/unscrewed first, there is no explaination about the methods of dissassembly, or the purpose of each individual part, or even groups.\n\nIn other words, the game runs as simply as this. In all of the game modes (except operation and shooting range), you have a 3D model of a weapon, you wait for the computer to 'clear' the weapon by racking the action and expelling all ammunition, and then it is your job to click the pieces that are to be dissassembeled 1st, 2nd 3rd, as the computer automatically dissassembles the parts/groups, and all the way until you have a complete 3D exploded view of the weapon, and then click the pieces in backwards order.\n\nAlthough there does seem to be some inconsitencies with the ordered parts in this game (on the AK-47, you must click the 'butt screws' before dismantling the wooden stock, however on the MP-5, the lower receiver just falls off magically?), this goes does serve as a great INTRODUCTION to each weapon. The operation mode allows player to watch the weapon fire with X-Ray vision, to watch the parts interact, however, there is no further explanation.\n\nAnother word. The game is FREE, therefore there are a couple draw backs. You do not have access to all the weapons at the start of the game! You have one starter gun, the AK-47, then you must master the dissassembly of this weapon to get 'XP" before unlocking more weapons! And oh, there is no list of weapons to choose from. Although weapon progressoin is not linear (there are often a couple branches to choose from), you will have to slog through some boring weapons before getting to your all-time-favorites. I will however REDEEM the developers by saying, this does force a player to actually master a weapon, and often times GO BACK to a previous weapon to re-learn and hopefully get more XP, but it can be really tedious . . . . OR you can purchase the game for $40 and have every weapon unlocked!\n\nHowever, start with the free version to make sure you can handle it ;)\n\n\n\n\n\n░░░░░▄▄▄░░▄██▄░░░\n░░░░░▐▀█▀▌░░░░▀█▄░░░\n░░░░░▐█▄█▌░░░░░░▀█▄░░\n░░░░░░▀▄▀░░░▄▄▄▄▄▀▀░░\n░░░░▄▄▄██▀▀▀▀░░░░░░░\n░░░█▀▄▄▄█░▀▀░░\n░░░▌░▄▄▄▐▌▀▀▀░░ THIS IS BOB\n▄░▐░░░▄▄░█░▀▀ ░░\n▀█▌░░░▄░▀█▀░▀ ░░ COPY AND PASTE HIM,\n░░░░░░░▄▄▐▌▄▄░░░ SO, HE CAN TAKE\n░░░░░░░▀███▀█░▄░░ OVER STEAM!\n░░░░░░▐▌▀▄▀▄▀▐▄░░\n░░░░░░▐▀░░░░░░▐▌░░\n░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░█░░░\n░░░░░▐▌░░░░░░░░░█░░░","October 25, 2014","true","137.7"," 41 of 53 people (77%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","77","41","53","10","7"

Learning about how guns work is interesting and taking apart and reassembling the guns is fun but the way the game makes you go about it is infuriating.\n\nI really enjoy seeing how each gun comes apart and how they go back together. Its great seeing how each part in the weapon works together to fire the bullet and chamber the next round. The x ray and slow motion options are great for capturing exactly how it all interacts. This game does present this all in a very nice way. I feel like i have learned alot about the weapons that i have unlocked however, some of those weapons are of no real interest to me.\n\nYou must unlock each weapon with experiance you earn from playing the game but you dont earn enough to ensure you will unlock the next weapon from hitting the most common achiements. This mean you need to repeat each test several times and combine with the frustrating mechanics you'll end up hating the game quickly. Additional the weapons are only unlocked following a tree that might see weapons you want to learn about hidden behind dozens of guns you are not interested in.\n\nThe experiance needed to advance is earned from getting achievments such as finishing under a set time or not clicking the wrong part. This method would be fine except that you have to wait out each animation before you can start the next part and by default the camera swings around wildly when each part is moved. This all makes it almost impossible to reach the better times needed to get some of the achievements. Additionally, clicking on a part before the animation has finished will count as clicking the wrong part and shut you out of another achievement further adding to the frustration.\n\nFinally, several achievements are require you to have a faster time then other people in the last 24 hours. These seem almost impossible to achieve as there are people who have unreasonably fast times blocking everyone from getting these achievements.\n\nMany of these problems would be resolved by buying the game but I feel it is simply not worth the money for a collection of interactive user manuals.","September 26, 2014","false","82.1"," 75 of 113 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","75","113","4","1"

The fact that such a large percentage of the game is locked behind a paywall removes my incentive to keep playing. The fact I've stopped playing doesn't even matter to them, if we aren't spending money then we are of no value to them as a community.

At first, I looked at it and thought "There is no way I'll like this.", but then I started playing it. I thought, 'Why would I want to do that?' almost every step of the way, after all, it's just taking bits out of a model and then putting it back together.\nWell, it turns out that if you have a few minutes to spare while a friend is off doing something, or half an hour before going to work with only boredom to keep you company, the prospect of a gun model to pull apart and put back together is pretty pleasing.\n\nMost things appear at first to be accessible with no payment needed, and a few that you can get by being the daily top score on a gun. It's free, so that's great value already, and you get hourly quizzes for bonus exp(Used to unlock more guns).\nSo then, how does it play?\nYou can field strip a gun, taking apart only bits of it, and then putting it back together\nYou can disassemble and reassemble a gun, which is doing the obvious\nThere is a simulation of how the guns work, with slow down, x-ray vision, and multiple magazines and assesories you can use\nAfter you completed those, you will unlock the 'game', 'supergame', and 'hardore game' modes.\nGame is a time attack, you have to disassemble and then reassemble your model as fast as possible, with bonusses for not clicking too fast and not clicking any part that you aren't going to activate. (Hint: Spacebar activates whatever you have selected, this will help your time a lot. You can also turn off the auto-zoom to selected parts in the options)\nSupergame is also a timed mode, but now you get to time your activation a second time on some parts. If on time, the part moves out faster. If not on time, it's slower. You get a bonus for not clicking too much.\nHardcore game automatically activates any part you click on, and you can activate multiple at once. This is where things get fast, with large amounts of bits, pins, screws, and all sorts of springs flying all over, you'll get a bonus if you don't click anything you can't activate\n\nAnd in all this, you will become very familiar with what I have called the "Ikea effect". Namely, there will be one or two little screws or pins somewhere that you can't find, possibly having vanished into the ether when you weren't looking. Luckily it isn't modeled on reassembly, so you won't have to worry about a spring rolling under somewhere and disappearing into an alternate plane of existence\n\nGun enthusiasts, you probably already have this. But if not, I recommend it to you.\nOthers, if you enjoy score-based or slightly competitive - With the whole playerbase or just between you and friends, this may be a good choice\nBut aside from that, if you just want to grab something simple to spend some time on between things you're doing, this is a great choice. The small size means its a fast download and the short gamemodes means you can spend as long as you want on this. But I'll warn you, perfection on a model may take a lot of time\n\n(I would also recommend a youtube search for LethalFeline, he has videos up of him playing if you still aren't sure)","March 17, 2015","true","25.4"," 36 of 52 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","36","52","5","0"

When you have enough XP, you can unlock the next gun.\n\nPROS:\n-Very skill based. You need to memorise what parts to move.\n-Leaderboards. Very competitive. You will think that you have the best times. Although some people clearly cheat, Noble Empire, get your ♥♥♥♥ together.\n-Very engaging mechanics. It's very satisfying to see all those animations.\n-Really easy to understand how to play.\n-If you are the plenty of time kinda player AND a gun enthusiast, this is the game for you.\n-As you get better at the game, you unlock achievements faster and faster, thus getting more XP and more guns.\n\nCONS:\n-Slow start in terms of XP. The game requires you to be good quite early.\n-Poor variety of music.\n-Inconsistent order of disassembly/assembly. You would think you can take that part out. Unfortunately, the game requires you to follow a specific order.\n-Inconsistent duration of the animations. Ruined many "speedruns".\n-Very small parts are hard to spot or don't come with the bigger parts.\n-Hidden guns are much more expensive unless they show up in the unlock tree.\n-Not recommended for casual players who just want to play and relax and not have to bother with the XP. But that's the life of free to play.\n\nWhen I started playing this game, I only had one weapon available which is the AK-47. Honestly I think they should introduce simpler weapons first, and maybe sort the weapons by type: handgun, assault rifle, smg... Oh well.\n\nI was immediately compelled by the mechanics of the game, the animations, the sounds, and the neat organisation of the parts in the 3D environment. I wanted to play more, I wanted to get better at the game. It's very easy to learn how to play.\n\nThen it told me that it has some modes of playing, Field Strip, Disassembling, Operation Assembling, Game, Super Game and Hardcore. Each mode is more difficult than the previous except for paint and operation. The hardcore mode requires you to know exactly what to do.\n\nOperation mode is quite fun. You can attach different stuff like suppressors, laser sight, bayonettas, etc. You can slow down the time and see how the weapon works when fired. It doesn't require you to disassemble the gun or anything.\n\nAfter I got good at the gun, I got enough XP points and unlocked my second gun. The pacing of the game in terms of unlocking is really well done, because you can get a weapon, and you can complete a lot of achievements for each weapon. I still haven't finished some weapons and I already have 2 guns in reserve to play. You could get a lot of XP really quickly if you dedicate your time to it. If you don't well, well then I don't recommend the game for people like you. You can also login to the game daily and amass more XP.\nI actually managed to get the complete set for 2 weapons. Very satisfying, would do it again.\n\nYes, you can't choose any weapon you want to disassemble, without paying time or money. Yes, if the gun isn't showing up in the main screen, it's a lot more expensive on the store.\n\nBut, all in all, still would recommend the game. Just because it's free to play.","January 15","true","11.7"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

A simulation based around the assembly, disassembly, maintenance and operation of various types of firearms which allows the user to better understand the mechanics of firearms and teaches the user the proper method of stripping, disassembling and reassembling their firearm, as well as giving history and insight into the design and use of the gun. As a concept, it is a fantastic idea as it allows the casual gun interest to better understand, and therefor respect, the tool that they admire as well as allow the seasoned gun enthusiast or collector a means of virtually disassembling a firearm without risking damaging its real-life counterpart.\n\nAs a gun enthusiast and owner myself, I saw World of Guns: Gun Disassembly as the latter, a helpful tool. However, the sheer tedium of grinding one gun constantly to get to the next, only to grind that gun again, coupled with both the steep learning curve and steep price tag ($49.99 for "Lifetime Access", which grants access to all guns, structures, vehicles and skeletons) has put me off of this notion. While the potental for greatness is there, the severely misguided execution of World of Guns has left it floundering with the rest in a sea of shovelware and lost ideas.\n\nSadly, I must leave this simulation with a negative vote.

It's a great way to educate and guide you on how guns operate and what to expect if you want to repair one of your pieces IRL. You start out with only an AK to toy around with and get 2 more for a while with little choices to getting other guns for free. I got 20,000 points out of nowhere though, which helped me get at least a half-dozen more guns to play with.\n\nSuggestions:\nBeef up the credits you get for IRL $. Maybe $10 for 60,000 or so? so $1 = 6,000? Maybe $1 for 10k. Some of the dlc is a tad bit overpriced and I'm used to steam sales anyways you know.\n\nMore ways of earning Credits like some more game modes if you can think something up.\n\nText is instant as in no scrolling till it loads completely.

However the guns are a real pain to unlock. In order to get enough experience to buy them you have to finish a bunch of challenges for previously unlocked guns, some of them are very hard, requiring you to dissasemble and reassemble a gun within a very small timeframe or without making a single mistake. Some guns require "credits" to buy which you get by completing insane challenges like getting the daily top score for fastest gun dissassembly + reassembly. Or you could get the DLC for 50$ to have all guns unlocked or buy EXP / Credits.

Mostly in the way you pull apart the guns piece by piece but there is a firing range and operation mode where you can fire the gun of your choice with different attachments such as silencers, scopes, different magazine sizes and just learn how every single component works with each other. The satisfaction you get when you pull apart and put back together a sophisticated gun with more than 60 parts without choosing the wrong components is probably more rewarding than shooting the gun itself.\n\nThe only downside to this game is that it's a bit grindey, but I guess that adds to the charm of getting to know each and every part of the weapon you are disassembling, but it's not too much of a problem for me as I don't really mind a bit of a grind sesh once in a while. Plus I get time to learn every weapon that is in the game instead of just blazing past every single gun and missing out on how they all work.\n\nIn conclusion, it's MUCH better than the Google Play and Apple store versions just because of the fact you have full control over the camera. Plus it's a stupidly fun and rewarding game if you're into pulling things apart then putting them back together just to see how they work and operate.","May 28, 2014","true","6.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Learning stuff about weapons, their assembly/disassembly procedures, operation modes and other was a lot of fun, indeed.\nI'm not very much into XP grinding for hours for a tiny gain. Also I prefer to pick a weapon by interest. So I even purchased unlock-all-guns-forever pack 'cause Support the developers, they said, it will be fun they said. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it is. This game is the source of frustration of many kinds.\n\nI have this game for more than a year now and here's what I got:\n- Most of this time this game could not even run: crashes and/or freezes since the very start of the game. They debug it like ♥♥♥♥ on major platforms like Windows and much much more ♥♥♥♥♥ier on others, like SteamOS. They don't seem to debug it at all on other platforms like generic Linux. I have Debian btw which is very close to Ubuntu and SteamOS. C'mon guys, crossplatform era (even in gaming) started years ago, not yesterday. Instead of delivering quality product devs concentrate too much on foisting new content and boosters.\nSometimes, some versions of the game could start so I faced the rest:\n- Not being able to connect to servers, losing progress and ♥♥♥♥.\n- Getting messages from the game like "We think you're a cheater, we don't trust your result, we won't accept it. If you disagree please contact support team." Should I say it was not even day high score?\n- Acquiring and loosing batches of achievements instantly. For absolutely no reason from my side, of course.\n- Cheaters. Cheaters everywhere. Some random guy appears and instantly gets weapon alltime highscore with time less than all disassembly/assembly animation takes being run super optimally. And yeah, he will appear tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. And the day after that day. Finally, if you're lucky, you will have a small window to compete with dozens of guys as desperate as you are.\n\nAs I stated before, my progress is not bound to weapon achievements, so I only got part of the frustration you guys get if you don't buy DLCs. Still too much though. For the guys whining about pay2win: oh yeah, it's here, but implemented like crap, so doesn't work for everyone, haha.\nDespite all of the above I got about 1% of normal gameplay I counted on, which is nice.\n\nNot recommended even if you have some mainstream platform, most issues are not related to it.\n","December 11, 2015","false","149.6"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","23","36","7","2"

The only way around it is to use windowed mode and thirdparty program to make it windowed-borderless ( haven't tested functionality ).\n\nInstead of being able to choose the weapon, ie I have an HK G36 and would like to see how accurate it is to provide feedback to the developers, you're stuck with the AK47 which you have to complete everything with before you have access to the menu then you're forced to unlock the Colt 1911 and complete that before you have the xp/points back to get something else, but the G36 is tens of thousands of points to unlock meaning you either have to purchase an XP booster pack to gain more xp ( $3 for 60 minutes for 2x xp ) to gain xp quicker in order to get up to the level to provide feedback, or you purchase credits or points to unlock or spend ~$23 to $50, depending where you get it, to unlock all of the weapons instantly...\n\nI can't spend the time necessary on it because of an automobile accident in 2011 which left me with a terribly messed up neck and back which causes a lot of other issues with sitting, laying, walking, etc... It is also the reason I haven't been able to go shooting since and was hoping to check out the game to see if it had the SL8 trigger system ( some of the springs are annoying to assemble so I removed the "lighter" trigger from mine but was thinking of re-adding it ) as an option, or not and if not then provide photos or feedback so it can be added.\n\nI can't spend the money on it because the job offers have vanished since the accident, all 6 figures minimum otherwise I'd gladly support the developer.\n\nThe camera system is terrible; you double-click on something to perform an action but instead of it happening the camera flings you around and you have to spend more time repositioning the mouse for each step then repositioning the camera back to a decent location, etc....\n\nThe audio is loud and nausea inducing with no way to adjust it without muting it in Windows because you have no access to the menu prior to completing the AK47..\n\nThe Escape key doesn't work, it doesn't open an options dialog to exit, etc.. to exit the game you have to close the task manually...\n\nIncorrect options for weapons ( The AK47 is "SAFE"/"AUTO", or "SAFE"/"FIRE[single]" depending on the variant; this WOG had 3 options which I haven't encountered yet but if it is a possibility then great... But the issue is with the weapon manipulation. I had to find the incredibly tiny button at the bottom left to complete the AK47 Assembly, Field-Strip, Disassembly and Operation modes... my advice: Remove them and click / drag the actual weapon... ), and instead of manipulating the gun as you see fit ( ie racking by clicking and dragging the mouse which would be more intuitive that double-clicking or clicking )","March 5","false","0.6"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","5"

Personally I am really addicted to this game at the moment. Ok first of all it is no real game... It is more a educational software for gunenthusiasts or a training module for your local shootingclub to further your knowledge about the internal parts of a gun and how a gun excactly works. But the game modes wich you will play a lot if you want to unlock more guns are fun (too a degree). I mean it is really not for everyone disassembling and assembling the same gun over and over again (to unlock new guns), but as this is more a tool to get knowledge about guns and how their internals work and the dependancies between those parts, I call that an excellent approach to bring that knowledge to guninterested people and I think it is really the easiest and fun way to learn about these things.\n\nAs I have read some reviews about this game myself, I read a lot about grinding in this game. For a game that is really Free to Play I think that isn't fair to say, cause even if it is a bit of grinding, you get full access to each and every gun through playing. If you are really bad at assembling and disassembling, just do it over and over again... you will get the hang to it and score your needed points.\n*Every 2 hours you can do a quiz where you just have to relate a black and white silhouette to a gunname, if you know gun's this is a fairly easy method for acquiring a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of points in just 30 sec. (every 2 hours without a hassle).* Update NOW every 1 hour * Kudos to the developers :)\n\nGet that game and try to beat my highscores, it is free to play afterall!!!","June 10, 2014","true","72.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

As a gun enthusiast I can say it's the best simulator in the genre that I've seen, it's an almost real experience. If you're looking for a random FPS don't download it, probably you'll find it boring, but if you wanna learn the mechanics or practise the disassembly of some of the most known and reliable weapons it's a must in your library. It has a greater educational value than entertainment value, however I do find pleasure on this kind of knowledge.\n\nContent - 9,5\nThere are several models of handguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, SMG's, etc. You start with an AK-47 and afterwards a Colt 1911, the other guns you will have to buy, but you can unlock many more with your exp. points. You get exp. completing achievements and logging in everyday. As if it wasn't good enough, you can also disassemble skeletons (got the highest score of the day :D) and vehicles, which I find amusing. In addition there are shooting ranges, quiz and information about the weapons. Models are downloaded the first time they're used.\n\nGameplay - 7.5\nModes are: field strip, disassembly, assembly, operation, game, super game and hardcore game, each has a description at the beginning. There are also achievements for each mode and world leaderboards for all 3 game modes. If you liked in the first 10 minutes, chances are you'll play for 10 hours in the first day, so I don't have to say it's replayable and addictive. You use the mouse to interact with parts and control the camera, you can also use keyboard for some actions but I don't recommend. Sometimes a different part is selected in game mode and in some modes the camera moves against your will. In most modes you have to wait for the end of the animation to perform an action, that's annoying in timed modes. RMB is a good and quick way to zoom a specific part. Controls could be more precise.\n\nGraphics - 7.5\nModels are very precise and some even include a bit of visual external wear (mechanic wear would make a nice DLC), however they only look like plastic. Options are very limited, but they're not very relevant on this game, you can identify any part at all times, and if you don't, there's a caption in the lower centre of the screen for each part selected. There's native AA support and fixed frame rate at 60fps. The game is windowed by default. In general the models look like any good directx 9 game, I believe it's playable even with integrated video cards. Menus could look better. The game hasn't crashed yet.\n\nOverall - 8.4\n\nCurrent specs\nIntel Core I7-4770K at 4.2ghz\nNvidia PNY GTX 770 2gb at 1201mhz\nKingston HyperX DDR3 8gb at 1600mhz (x2)\nHP 1TB SATA III 7200rpm\nWindows 7 Premium SP1\nSony Bravia KDL-42W655A at 1080p","January 6, 2015","true","134.7"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","25","41","0","9"

It's perfect in every way, save for a few flaws. The only issue, is that the flaws are extraordinary in comparison to the pro's. Not only is it basically a grindathon if you rather not put money into microtransactions, but you must have a certain number of friends (which number increases the more you unlock.) in order to play the shooting range courses.. The most entertaining PART of the game, may I add. (No pun intended.) I'd rather have paid at least 10 US Dollars for this game and have the whole thing to myself, rather than have it contain microtransactions and friend-poking. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I hope they make it a retail game soon, as that might remove the microtransaction and friend-needing element. The experience system is neat, as to challenge yourself to beat new difficulties in order to progress, but grinding does not equal challenge. It equals impatience and disinterest. And if you even try to repeat beaten game modes (Disassemble/Reassemble/Operate/Field Strip, etc.) the experience count you get for completion is laughable at best.\n\nFor operate, (COLT 1911.) I got 200 experience, repeated, it gives me a whopping 5. With the wallet-tease "IF YOU HAD A BOOSTER, YOU'D GET A WHOLE 12.5 EXTRA EXPERIENCE POINTS!!!!!111!!1oneoneoneeleveneleventy! JUST PAY US!" If you wont take my review seriously due to the time I've invested in the game already, it's because the curve the game grants you from "Hey! Welcome to Facebook, Guns edition!" to "PAY US PLZ!" is a mere half an-hour if you really are into it. Two guns, out of the hundreds available, are unlocked for me right now. With the MP5 within 300 experience points away. The only options I have to get these points are to spend money, or beat a "Super-Game" (Disassemble/Reassemble perfectly with no double-clicks or flaws while timed.)\n\nAt the moment, and I hate to say this, because Firearms are an extreme hobby of mine, is I do not reccommend this game at this current state, floppy connections, friend-bugging neccessities, and pay-to-win ruined it for that giant elated smile I had on my face when I hit "Play".\n\nOn another plus side, I got to dis/reassemble a human skeleton. Which was cool. Sadly I have to pay credits to play the Car assembly, Motorcycle assembly, and the rest of the Skeletal assembly games. I guess I'm alright with the AK-47 and the COLT 1911. for now.\n\nI will change my review as this game has hefty updates. Thank you.","May 21, 2014","false","1.9"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","2"

Tutorial given to you is pretty well done.\n\nOh you can also go to the firing range to test out your weapon but the major downside is that you need to find friends that play this game too to unlock the mode.\n\nNot only you get to learn,dissemble & assemble guns,you also do the same for human & animal skeleton as well as car parts.\n\nGRAPHICS : 6/10\n\nThe weapon detail overall is pretty decent though some parts of the guns is hard to distinguish from the others.\n\nYou can choose 4 different background.\n\nSome of the interface look like it came from a Facebook app. Seriously i am not kidding. If you ever try this game then you know what i am talking about.\n\nAUDIO : 4/10\n\nThe sound design for the weapon is really bad. You thought for a game that teaches you about guns,it would at least have a realistic firing sound effects.\n\nSoundtrack is repetitive and only contain like 2-3 of them.\n\nLONG-LASTING APPEAL : 3/10\n\nCan't say you have much fun in this game. There isn't much to do rather than assemble,dissemble,testing out the weapon,beat somebody high scores. That all you do throughout the whole game and it get boring pretty fast.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 4.3/10\n\nIf you want to learn about guns,then try this. However if you are looking for a good gun simulators or fun experience then don't bothers since this game is more like a learning program .\n\nA lot of the bonus things can't be unlocked unless through purchasing credits using real cash. So basically what they ask is Please Give Us Money.\n\nYou can get 20 credits by doing offers though but that consist of inviting your friends to play this game. If none of your friends play this game then your chances of unlocking other weapons or modes is 0.\n\nGRADE : F ( Horrible )","May 21, 2014","false","0.8"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","0"

Your first gun is an AK-47, and the game lets you field strip, dissasemble, assemble, operate and then do a little mode called "game" where you must dissasemble and assemble the gun without any hints in one sitting.\n\nThe best way to describe it is to say "A puzzle game with guns", click on the correct part and that part is no more, click on the wrong part and, unless you're in Super Game, you'll get nothing.\n\nThere's lots of guns, with Wild West guns such as a Colt Single Action Army, with World War 1 or 2 guns like the MP40, to modern-day rifles like the H&K G36E. The tree that you can unlock these guns with is huge, but is covered with a sort of fog that reveals the guns the closer you get to them. You will need XP to purchase the guns, and you get XP by playing around with your current guns.\n\nI'd say give it a bash, it's not that bad and can be pretty fun. Oh yeah and there's shooting ranges but they are kind of dull as only specific guns (I think only 14 guns has ranges) has ranges and they are mostly "Shoot targets 5 times" or "Hit all these targets within time" and whatnot.\n\nIf you are lucky, you might be able to stop terrorists by dissasembling their guns right infront of their face. But you need to be skilled, fast, and have the Sniper achievement for every gun in order to do this.","August 17, 2014","true","57.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Unlocked several firearms, and getting to know their inner workings is a blast! I'll try to keep this spoiler free if you're looking forward to finding out all the different firearms you can get, like I am. It's A LOT of fun, and is THE game to get for gun owners who find legitimate enjoyment in disassembling/cleaning their firearms. Truth be told, I've managed to completely disassemble/reassemble my Springfield Armoury M1911A1 Mil Spec while blindfolded without using tools within 30 minutes flat. The only things I didn't muck with is the sights, the barrel link, and the... tail thing on the hammer. That's right, I even took out the mag release spring and screw, without the use of my eyes lol Anyways, back to the game... if you always wanted to learn how firearms function, how their individual pieces come together to form one cohesive tool, this is the perfect game for you.\n\nI've never played anything like it, but I've wanted a game like this for years, possibly a decade. The closest thing I remember is a flash game on Newgrounds that allows you to eject the mag, replace the mag, rack the slide, and fire. Not at anything in particular, just to operate the firearm. Of course this has that, and LOADS more. I'm only 6 hours in, I've unlocked a fair number of firearms, and the ones that I'm seeing that are possible to unlock I'm very much looking forward to!\n\nHere's where some of the *SPOILERS* start to come in, but they're mild, I won't mention any other firearms yet, I'll give a warning before I have a nerdgasm on that. There's a leaderboard for disassembly/reassembly time, and there's also some shooting ranges. The firearms will behave quite realistically with mag+1, select fire, and all that good stuff. The only way I could see it being better is if you could adjust the sights, if the controls to reload were more like Receiver, and if you used individual mags instead of the typicall 'ammo pool' that you'll find on CoD and Battlefield. Alright, now to talk about firearms next, so if you want that to remain a surprise, divert your eyes now lol\n\nYou start out with the AK47, how appropriate is that? Known for being simple, it's still got some complexity when it comes down to knowing which parts to remove first. Still, VERY enjoyable learning about every last individual part and how they all interact. Next was the M1911A1 (Called Colt 1911 unfortunately. I mean it's a Colt, but it's an M1911A1, not a 1911), and other than the barrel link not dropping before coming out of the slide, as well as the way the hammer assembly needs to be strictly removed AFTER the leaf spring (which is simply nonsense), it's 100% accurate to real life. After that you get the option to unlock the MP5 or Tech-9 if memory serves correctly, and branching off those are the Beretta 92 and CZ75 respectively.\n\nThe Tech-9 is surprisingly simple, while the MP5 is DEFINITELY more complex. Now both the M92 and CZ75B are complex in their own right, but I found the Beretta to be particularly unforgiving with its hoard of tiny spring/plugs/pins. Then again, I also had to replace the trigger return spring on my 1982 CZ75 Pre-B so that kind of gave me a hand in figuring it out, came pretty naturally. There are also some historic gems, I can see the sillouette of the PPSH-41, M1928 Thompson, P08 Luger, and the ancestor that lead to the P08 which I can't remember the name. Borsharte? Something like that.\n\nThere's more to unlock after finding those out, and they apparently release another firearm at least once a month! All in a free-to-play game!!! You need to unlock experience however in order to unlock said firearms, and that takes quite a lot of disassembly/reassembly as well as time at the shooting range. Both I find quite enjoyable :P Ah, there's also a firearm quiz that you can take once every 2 hours. It lasts 30 seconds, and you have to name all the firearms you can, at 300 Exp. per model. If you get one wrong, you don't get any experience whatsoever, so be careful with your choices. Last time I played it I got 8, which is 2400 Exp. That's almost half way to unlocking another firearm for me, however they seem to be getting more and more expensive.\n\nPerforming feats of speed/precision with the shooting and disassembly/reassembly, are the only other ways to get experience at a convenient rate. Though doing the disassembly/reassembly over and over doesn't give you experience very quickly, neither is doing the shooting ranges over and over. The first time you make the time limit/hit number, you get a good amount, but every time after that is only a morsel of your first reward, so unless you want to spend money buying Exp. or credits, you're going to be doing a lot of quizes/shooting/disassembly/reassembly to unlock those juicy firearm models you're dying to get your hands on. Not that that's unenjoyable, but it does distinctly feel like grinding. Eventually doing it more for the Experience than the enjoyment. So basically what I'm saying is unless you're willing to pay, you'll need patience. I have loads of it, so I look forward to making this my go-to game for the foreseeable future :)\n\nAnyways I think that concludes what I know so far. If you're into the mechanical workings of firearms, then get this free-to-play game right now. No hesitation. If you just like playing shoot-em-ups without really caring how firearms come apart or work, well, you'll have to earn the shooting ranges you unlock in the game. Takes Experience for those too, you see. So far I only have two unlocked, and the next will cost me 8000 Experience if I recall correctly, which is a couple hours worth of grinding/quizzing. Still really fun though, with lots of modes to choose from, and I'm hoping to get some adjustable sights/bullet drop with the longer range firearms :) Happy shooting, and remember, check to make sure your firearm is clear before beginning your field strip or disassemble ;) Safety first!","June 1, 2014","true","92.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","3"

However the game is quite demanding. It expects you to deep dive into the guns, it's mechanics and constructions. I'd love to find some kind of chillout mode, for players who want to simply learn how to use and clean some various guns. For now, it starts with forcing you to disassemble and assemble about 100 elements of AK-47 - and you should do this really fast to go further for next guns and tasks.

I've always wanted to be a gunsmith, this game is kind of my "gunsmith-in-training" game, and sometimes realizing how many parts are in a single weapon, take the AK for example. I never thought it had 96 parts, considering it's easy field strip. Although there are a couple guns where I would think "OK, I don't want to ever mess with this, too many little tiny parts (SG 552, I'm talking about you)".Although I've only unlocked like 5 guns, there are ones I can't wait to unlock and tinker with. There are quite a few historical guns that really tickle the WWII history buff in me. Thompsons, 1911's, guns that everyone will recognize, and a few that I haven't heard of, but eventually knowing how to completely disassemble, reassemble, and field strip like the back of my hand.The game modes give a good challenge, like SuperGame. One wrong part click, gotta start all over. The community and developers are great, new guns regularly, game is alive with content.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like about WoG is it's long tutorial. When I first started the game up, it automatically put me into a field strip mode, went through that, had to disassemble and reassemble, then had to know about every button there was in the game.\n\n9/10 great game for 2nd Amendment supporters and people wanting to get into the 2nd Amendment profession.","January 9, 2015","true","149.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HankHayha/recommended/262410/","HankHayha","Hank ( 백금_おっぱい )","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HankHayha/","38 products in account","World of Guns: Gun Disassembly. A very simple game for those who love firearms or want to know more about firearms.\n\nThis is not really a game where you have fun compared to shooters or simulators or simulators that are made for the lolz.\nThis game is educational or an easy 3D source material for those who make replicas, fix guns etc.\n\nThe game starts well. It tells you how the game works and what you can do in a very straightforward manner.\nThe rules are simple. You unlock a model, play the game modes, unlock achievements and receive xp to unlock the next model.\n\nThe game modes are: field strip, disassembly, assembly, operation, game, supergame and hardcore mode.\nField strip- you field strip the weapon\nDisassembly- you take the weapon completely apart\nAssembly- you put the firearm back together\nOperation- you fire the weapon, reload it and customize it\nGame- you disassemble the weapon and assemble the weapon as fast as you can (there are 3 achievements. Timed I is easy, Timed II is medium and Timed III is hard)\nSuper game- Like game mode but harder. If you click on the wrong part you lose and you have to restart from scratch.\nHardcore mode- you can make more moves. Example: when playing HC mode with an AK47 you can take the magazine, cleaning rod, top cover, pistol and the cleaning kit apart (located in the stock) in a few seconds. To unlock the hardcore achievement you must take your gun apart and assemble it flawlessly. You can not take things apart instantly. For example if you remove the magazine on some guns you can not remove another part while the magazine is being taken out. You have to wait for the animation to end in order to take another part apart or when putting parts back together.\n\nThere are also shooting ranges where you shoot weapons and gain xp but you need xp to unlock them.\nIn shooting ranges you are given a task to shoot X targets X ammount of times with X ammount of rounds.\nThe reloading animations look robotic in my opinion but they are better than tacky animations.\nIts another game mode but if you want to unlock all of the guns then you might think about avoiding them but unlocking shooting ranges is also good because you can gain xp from them and possibly get credits from them on the first try (if your final score is good enough you might be the top scoring player of the day and receive 1 credit).\n\nAnd then there is Quiz. When playing Quiz you are given an image of a firearm and you have to pick the right answer.\nSounds easy but if you are not familiar with alot of firearms you are gonna have a hard time because if you pick the wrong answer the quiz is over, you get 0xp and you have to wait 1 hour in order to take the quiz again.\nSo the best way to play this is to memorize the models or print an image list. If you dont know the answer then the best option is to do nothing because something is better then nothing.\n\nThere is also bonus content where you can take cars, motorcycles and skeletons apart. The human skeleton is free but the rest is not. Which brings me to xp and credits.\n\nThe more guns you unlock the more xp you need to unlock the next model. Now you get a decent ammount of xp for playing the game modes but after unlocking the achievements you get less but depending on the model and the ammount of xp it requires you get more xp (a 16000xp model will give you more xp compared to a 10000xp model). Credits can be earned if you unlock the champion achievement (you can unlock it by topping the scorebored in the Day section. There is also Week and All time. Theres also highscores for each game mode. And if you lack the ability to think the Day section will show you the top scoring players of the day and yes the scoreboard resets). You also get free xp for playing the game the day after so the game is not that cruel. But if you lack patients you can buy a booster pack which doubles your xp or you can buy credits or xp with your money. 1.99 € for 5000 xp. You can also buy DLC to unlock everything but I have not looked that up very well so yeah you can simply buy all of the models for 50€.\nWhile that kinda sounds like a P2E (pay to enjoy) you can get all the models for free if you play casually.\nCasually playing is mini grinding and playing Quiz. When you have enough xp you unlock the model you want to unlock, have fun with it and start mini grinding and playing Quiz until you get the next one.\n\nGraphics- since my settings are set to low to get a lot of fps. I am not going to judge but it looks fine. Not super realistic but good for an educational game.\n\nMusic and backround art- the music is fine but the backrounds are not. In my opinion the default backround is the best for me cus the space backrounds look cheesy. If you like the space backrounds go ahead and use em. What ever floats your boat keep it floating.\n\nPros: educational, no major glitches, fun animations when taking the weapons apart, free and alot of models to check out.\nCons: due to the ammount of xp you need you will grind at one point or another and it does take a while to unlock a new model.\n\nTips: when taking firearms apart while trying to get the best time disable auto focus in the settings. Leave it on in disassembly and assembly mode for ease of learning.\n\nOverall the game is fine. Its not a mega fun blast. Its educational. 7.5/10","June 2, 2014","true","84.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It just takes an unreasonable amount of time to accrue more XP. So install it, but think of it as a demo. If you like it enough to finish the AK in Super Game mode, then ask yourself if you want to see another 100+ guns at the same level of detail. If you do, then spend the $50 and get the DLC that unlocks all content. Otherwise move along.","October 18, 2014","true","9.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

In fact the AK-47 is the very first gun available.\n\nYou can basically field strip, disassemble, reassemble and operate a large variety of guns. If you think you are good enough, you can unlock the timed competative modes and test your skills against people around the world.\n\nFor certain models of guns, there are also unlockable shooting ranges to try for some high scores in target practice.\nThe shooting range experience won't make you feel like you're playing a AAA FPS, but at least you can test the guns in action.\n\nAs of this writing, there are also other things that can be disassembled, such as skeletons, cars ( Including a Delorean ), a motorcycle, and even a tank!\n\nOn top of all that, the game is free to play. You unlock guns by earning points ( or credits, explained later ). You earn points by assembling/disassembling, using, or winning timed modes with the guns you already have. You can also earn points with a daily quiz and a referral system. To unlock credits however, you either need to make top place in the best times (daily times fortunately), get the referreal bonus, or pay money.\n\nIf you want access to ALL guns at once, or boosters, that's where the money comes in.\n\nI was kind of sad that some of the guns and most of the bonus content (cars, skeletons, etc) required credits to unlock, but I can understand the decision, as the level of detail was no doubt extremely time intensive to reproduce.\n\nYou don't have to buy it, but you should definitely try it!","July 9, 2014","true","52.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are a lot of weapons to read about, look at and disassemble to the smallest part, but not all of them are easily accessible. For instance, there are some guns, that cost a lot of xp points (36,000 for a simple pistol) and some require credits, which you can only get with real money. What saves this game from being a total grinder is weapons quiz. You have 30 seconds to recognise as many weapons as possible, and for 1 correct answer each, you get 300 xp points, which is a reasonable amount. There are some shooting areas, but I found those to be the weakest part of the game, boring and sluggish.\n\nIf you are a Gun Nut, who's mostly interested in how weapons work, then I would strongly recommend this game, if not,  then you won't find much enjoyment here.","December 19, 2014","true","43.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

You can take apart a weapon to the very core, every little spring, pin, and bolt can be removed and replaced. You can also simulate operations, i.e., firing, reloading, unloading, etc. Moreover, you can do it in slow-motion, or simply pause and scroll through the footage and frames manually to get an in-depth view.\n\nThe texture quality is more than decent; it's not like a realism mod, but you can see every little groove and angle that would be present in the real weapon very clearly. For example, I know nothing about guns, just like them in general, got this, then figured out thoroughly, simply through slow-motion footage, exactly how an AK-47 fires with every little detail.\n\nAbout Being Free to Play\n\nThe   game  is not free to play. The  demo  is. You don't get even a tenth of the full game content without puchasing at least an $8 pack. However, considering you can still take apart a few weapons and run operation demos for free, it's definitely worth the download for anyone who likes taking things apart. It's especially worth the download if you want to educate yourself on guns and their anatomy and functions. I'm already much more fluent in the nature of firearms from the small time I've played.\n\nI'm waiting a while to see if any packs will be on sale, like the 4 cars pack is as I'm typing this, and if I can't find anything soon I'll probably purchase the lifetime access. It's overpriced, but not by much, and I'm willing to spend a bit extra for this kind of content.","May 25","true","3.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It doesn't have to meet standards of a game. It can be as boring as possible to get its point across or provide the education it is designed to give. World of Guns: Gun Disassembly is a simulation that is meant to teach you the innerworkings of several guns. That is its objective, nothing incredibly fancy. Too me, it accomplishes this. The developers of this program provide a large quantity of guns, more than any other simulator that focuses on disassembly and reassembly does, and more models are being developed. Negative reviews that state their main point as being "This game is boring" don't understand this game is not supposed to be fun. It can be fun if you are interested in weaponry, but if you wish to shoot other people or targets, this is not made for that. I think you should experience this to see if you have any interest in models or guns in general.\nSecond, people point out the grinding for a new weapon. There are ways around this. One being an option on the main interface with the weapon trees. It is at the very bottom and is the "Catalog". This allows you to purchase a weapon without having an adjacent weapon on the tree unlocked. This does require more xp than purchasing it when it is able to be normally unlocked. A second way to reduce grinding is the "Quiz" tab at the top of the interface. This opens a 30 second quiz where you have to name a weapon being given only it's silhouette. To succeed, you must name the weapons with no mistakes. One mistake will forfeit your xp gained from the quiz. You can do this quiz once every 2 hours. A third way of gaining xp is to log on once every day. Each day logged on gives you xp, which increases each day. I believe that the xp needed to unlock a weapon should be decreased a little, which it most likely will be decreased in an update due to public opinion.\nThird, dlc costs are high. This simulation is still growing. The developers are offering you the chance to purchase every existing model, and have access to every new model that is developed. That is extremely generous so I believe that the price should stay relatively high to moderate. I for one will not purchase the dlc because I am dedicated enough to earn every weapon because for me, this simulation is pretty high quality.\nFourth, now that I have mentioned the quality of the simulation, I'll talk about graphics and overall structure. The simulation has graphics that work. They are not high resolution, and that shouldn't really matter for this. I would like to see better graphics, but for what the simulation wants to accomplish, it is perfectly fine as is. The graphics are simpler which makes it easier to show contrast between parts which is important when trying to disassemble something. The graphics themselves should not make or break this download. Now the simulation progresses by having the player do certain tasks, staring with a field strip of the selected weapon. Once the field strip section is complete, you move on by performing a disassembly and reassembly. Then you move on to the operation of a weapon, which introduces you with how the weapon works while firing, reloading, unloading, using a safety, different rates of fire, and add-ons to the weapon such as a grip or flashlight. Once complete, you move on to the game, super game, and hardcore game which are all about learning which parts can be removed in which orders, and how fast you can do so. After xp is gained from each exercise, you can purchase a new weapon, and the cycle repeats. This may seem boring, but this is how disassembly of a weapon works, you break it down and build it back up again.\nFinally, people complain about bugs. This simulation is new to Steam. Bugs will happen. One common bug is the "LOGIN_BY_CLIENT" bug. Several people have fixed this bug by deleting and reinstalling the program. People have also complained about having their save data "vanishing". Your data will come back. This happend to me and my data came back within the hour. These bugs will eventually be ironed out, but for now are not major problems since the simulation is new.\nI realize that this review has been long and has jumped around, and for that I am sorry, but this simulation has had ridicule for not appealing to some audiences, and I know that some people are going to see those reviews and be turned away. I feel as though this is a simulation that has already achieved a lot, and still has great potential given the variety of weapons humanity has created. I for one love this simulation. I recommend it for people who enjoy complexities, machines, construction, and guns. This simulation can be quite taxing on the mind so be wary of that, but the innerworkings of guns are extremely specific and thus are difficult to disassemble in reality, and this simulation replicates that extremely well. I hope you give this simulation a shot and that people can learn about weapons in a cheap, and safe manner thanks to this simulation.","June 23, 2014","true","55.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Me, I've always wanted to know how some of the weirder looking guns function, and now I do.\n\nTaking guns down is easy, and putting them back is equally easy, but doing so flawlessly and fast takes certain skill.\nWith closer to a hundred firearms, there's plenty of guns to learn the inside out.\n\nSure, the graphics could be better, but I see this more as a tool than a game so it's not as important.\nIf you like guns and useless information, this is your jazz.

There are several modes of play from a basic field strip to a full on disassembly of the gun right down to the last screw and spring. There is a reassmebly mode and then there are 3 different game modes that require you to do a full disassemble and reassemble while being timed with bonuses for not clicking any of the wrong pieces among others. This game has a large and beautiful catalog of guns to choose from. Everything from Mauser to Glock as well as Beretta, Colt, AK variants, Heckler and Koch, Fabrique Nationale, Walther and many others.\n\nThis is a fantastic game for any gun enthusiast. It will make you a lot more knowledgeable about the guns and how they break down. You can also see an x-ray view of how the gun works in real time or slow motion while it is in operation.\n\nIf that isn't enough you can also fire guns off at firing ranges as you unlock them. (You must unlock guns as well as ranges) One downfall to this is that it doesn't let you choose which gun to use at the range. The ranges have 4 games which are preset to certain guns.\n\nIn the end I don't think there is much to complain about. The game is free, and it has tons of guns. You can compete for high scores with other players and friends. You can learn about all of the parts of the guns, and you can even select an option that allows you to see the names of each and every part.\n\nIf you love guns, get this game. You won't regret it.\n\nI own a beretta 92FS and I will say the break down of the gun in the game is 100% accurate to the real thing. Every spring, every pin, every screw.

Me, I've always wanted to know how some of the weirder looking guns function, and now I do.\n\nTaking guns down is easy, and putting them back is equally easy, but doing so flawlessly and fast takes certain skill.\nWith closer to a hundred firearms, there's plenty of guns to learn the inside out.\n\nSure, the graphics could be better, but I see this more as a tool than a game so it's not as important.\nIf you like guns and useless information, this is your jazz.

The gameplay is very nice, and is a new idea. However, it is not yet flawless. The MP5 rifle has a glitch in the operation, and the firing ranges are extremely difficult, to the point that it takes a painful amount of time and luck to pass them.

It's a fun little toy for gun enthusiasts and hobbyists. So far, there seems to be a variety in the available guns, the accuracy of the firearms seems to be of top-notch quality, and the assembly and disassembly can be addicting. If you're looking for traditional fun, you will probably not find it as what you get in the game is what it advertises. You mostly assemble, disassemble, and learn about various firearms. If that doesn't interest, go elsewhere. There are two other gripes I have with the game. Firstly, if you lose connection to the servers, you're gonna have a bad time. It's not uncommon for me to lose connection which results in me having to restart the game. This is a nuisance and can become frustrating. The second major problem is the Facebook game-esque nature. You unlock things by grinding (assembling, disassembling, and playing games repeatedly) and inviting friends to play. You can also get things like XP boosts to unlock more guns and bonuses quicker. If you're not into having your fun held hostage until you get x amount of friends playing this, then go elsewhere.\n\nPersonally, I love it so far.\nbrb, assembling Kalashnikov","May 21, 2014","true","22.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FinnVArthur/recommended/262410/","FinnVArthur","Finn V. Arthur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FinnVArthur/","145 products in account","TL;DRHave you ever wondered how firearms work? If so, this is a perfect opportunity to familiarise yourself with gun mechanics... for free!\n+ LOADS of firearms, including rifles, pistols, machine guns, grenade launchers, and even artillery\n+ Attention to detail\n+ X-ray, slow-motion, and other features help you see better how a gun works\n+ Quiz\n+ Low system requirements\n+ Suited both for short (although it may be hard to stop playing) and long sessions\n- Steals time like nobody's business\n- Inconsistent\n- Frustrating and unforgiving at times\n- Grindy\n\nREVIEW\nWorld of Guns is a free gun simulator. It lets you disassemble and assemble firearms. Moreover, you can also see how a gun works and, albeit in a few cases only, visit a shooting range and put your aiming skills to test.\n\nThe gameplay is centred around, you guessed it, assembling and disassembling weaponry. It relies mostly on memorising which parts to move and when to do that. You can move single parts and the whole assemblies. The downside associated with it is that the moveable parts vary from weapon to weapon and it is very easy to make mistakes when disassembling/assembling. Who said that gun assembly was easy?\n\nApart from the clue of the game, you can also examine how a firearm works. There are some features which come in handy, including x-ray vision and slow-motion. During the "Operation", you perform many actions with the gun, such as fire, reload, attaching accessories (flashlights, scopes, etc.), changing the fire mode, and so on.\n\nThe weaponry ranges from historical (Winchester 1887) to modern-day rifles (TAR-21) and everything in-between. There are well-over 100 guns, including pistols, machine guns, and even artillery. To access them, however, you have to earn it the hard way. You start with the AK-47 and unlock other weapons by spending either experience points or credits. The former are earned by completing the weapon tasks (field strip, disassembly, assembly, operation, normal game, super game, and hardcore game) and completing quizzes (one quiz per hour). The latter are either bought or earned by topping the scoreboard in normal, super, or hardcore games (one credit per weapon). Getting all the guns requires a lot of grinding, but that is to be expected from a free game.\n\nTo sum up, I recommend this game not only to firearm fans but also to people playing casually. Despite being an unforgiving and sometimes frustrating game, it is still tons of fun to play and discover. Furthermore, it can be ran on pretty much any PC. Beware though: a wise man once said that this game should not be played at an airport. Mark his words, for you might miss your flight! A 9/10.\n\nP.S.

It's like a memory game with guns, with some sexy firing animations to break up the monotony. There is a lot of grinding, but most of it can be avoided by simply mastering the hourly quizes which will net roughly 1/3rd of the experience required for the best gun each time you take one. The best thing this game has going for it is the developers, who are probably some of the most active I've seen for any game. Just look at the Steam community forums, they respond to pretty much everything.\n\nI would love to see camera hotkeys similar to Starcraft where you set hotkeys to a predetermined camera state and more historical guns (let's face it most of the polymer pistols feel the same).","July 3, 2014","true","46.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is free to play, however you will have to grind some weapons in order to get them all... the extent to which you have to do this, I am unsure, as I just got all the DLCs instead because I wanted to see what the Minigun was like, among many other weapons. However, if you like guns, and ever wanted to take one apart but didn't actually have the gun, I think you would like this game and I recommend it to you.","August 5, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics, while not necessarily impressive, are nice, and the "Operation" mode is just outstanding.  Every working part of the gun is shown to you - be it in varying levels of X-ray mode, and/or in slow motion, you can see how a gun operates from the inside out.  This isn't just limited to one weapon, either - every gun you unlock, you can watch how all of the parts interact to fire a bullet.\n\nAs well, the disassembly/assembly modes are pretty cool, and the "game" and "super game", and "hardcore game" modes are really fun.  You're not just racing the clock or grinding for EXP, you're learning how a gun is constructed at the same time.  I've field stripped a Colt 1911 in real life before, and this game has it down to a T.  I haven't fully disassembled one before, but I'm assuming they got that right, as well.\n\nAll in all, really fun, sort of niche game that you should definitely go for.  It takes about 10 minutes to install, and is literally an educational time waster (for free!).","February 15, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The M-16 A1 model brought back not-so-fond memories of skinning my knuckles trying to pull out the handguards.

You get to see how most of everything inside works.\n2. You get to fire the weapons.\n\nWhat's not so good:\n\n1. The full weapons unlock should allow hiding all new guns and click to show/hide guns as needed so it is not so damn hard to navigate. It is overwhelming when you see all of the guns up to date displayed in one shot.\n2. I wish I could use my controller in the shooting games.\n3. The game doesn't explain things, it just walks you through. And sometimes the safeties can't be engaged by clicking on the weapon, you have to click a menu button.\n4. Sometimes the fire selectors don't allow all positions, so you are also stuck using a menu button to select fire modes.\n5. The only adjustable sight post that moves at all so far is the AK-47. The M16-A1s front post doesn't turn, unless I am doing something wrong.\n6. Some weapons should allow movement of the hammer but the model only allows to pull back the slide.\n\nWish list for the developers:\n\n1. Allow show/hide of items already purchased/unlocked/etc.\n2. Allow a visualization of the return mechanism, for example the M16-A1 should show me the gas blow back, etc.\n3. Allow sights to move if/when the originals do.\n4. Explain a little bit more of what's going on.\n5. All safeties, fire selectors, de-cocking levers, etc. should be movable from the model, not from menu buttons.\n\nBTW, hats off to the parties responsible for the game mode achievement for doing things in the right order. It's frustrating as hell, but these being dangerous machines it makes sense to force people to learn an assembly sequence. I have been busting my ♥♥♥ for two long miserable days trying to do the Colt 1911 in order and I keep screwing up because I pick the main spring out of sequence or I click the recoil spring plug when I wanted to click on the recoil spring, that kind of thing.\n\nOverall:\n\nA complete absolute win for anyone that is curious about how machines work. The first time you dig into that AK-47 and you figure out on your own why the auto mode works, you'll feel like a rocket scientist.","February 13, 2015","true","31.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Renorick/recommended/262410/","Renorick","Renorick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Renorick/","281 products in account","Not quite my definition of a "Game". More an educational simulator. It is a "Free-to-play" game in the sense that it comes with the nowadays standard (as much as it makes me want to stab someone with a rusty butterknife realising that) psychological warfare that is "microtransactions". For advance unlocks, "Credits", "Experience Boosters", etc.\n\nAnd the game is not without its problems:\n\nSome components you have to arbitrarily disassemble yourself, even when others do so automatically, which is an "inconsistency of the rules" I consider a crime.\n\nAdditionally, some components that you'd assume could be removed or (dis)assembled without interference from other components (example, taking off a muzzle/compensator/suppressor thinking the front sight won't be a holdup), THINK AGAIN, you're doing it their way or not at all! Which is a rather irksome issue. Common sense says that such steps should be performable interchangeably. This is plainly evident with the AK-47's accessory case in the stock, were that step a requirement to proceed, I might think differently, but you can dissassemble everything BUT the stock without any restriction, not only implying that you already have tools on hand, but that the restriction has ZERO reason to be there! And that's from the *first* gun you work on.\n\nEach gun comes with its own array of "Achievements" you unlock towards a massive XP (which is used to unlock more guns) stipend at the end. However there are no less than two such achievements that rely on leaderboard placement. Which is equal parts skill, luck, and psychosis. (Guys, AXE THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS!)\n\nThis issue is exasperated by the fact that some components take half-an-iceage to extricate or disassemble themselves.\n\nAnd lastly there is a small "quiz" minigame you can take every hour that tests your ability to identify certain firearms. Problems being that you only get the thumbnail from the gun "map" to go off of, so similar looking models are easily mistaken for eachother (I'm looking at YOU, Walther PP and Makarov PM!). And on top of that, when you get ONE wrong answer, all the experience you've built up (and it builds up quickly, which is nice, and sort of alleviates some of the aforementioned psych-warfare) is GONE. And the only way to get a question wrong and make off with the points is to let the 30 second timer run down.\n\nWhen you make a wrong answer, it tells you what the right answer was (after a short delay, which may confuse some), but when the timer runs out (whether by choice or simple lack of time), you leave with all accumulated points. Which may be interpreted as a tradeoff, you make a wrong response, you lose all points, but are told what the correct answer was, you let the timer run down, you keep all your points, but you are left in the dark on the last model. Which is especially frustrating when it (again) looks extremely similar to one or two other models. So, in short, make a judgement call: are you willing to lose all those points you've earned on a guess, or did you just start and have (almost) none to lose?\n\n\nOverall, I think this game can do a whole lot more in terms of educating (Example: What the hell is a sear? I've never heard of one until now!), it is nothing short of fascinating to see the internal workings of quality, classic, and iconic firearms. If you like guns, learning about them [not only do you get to (dis)assemble them, but each one has a comprehensive encyclopedia interface, complete with wiki links!], or are just curious about the internal workings of said guns, I give this game a (tentative) recommendation.","July 18, 2014","true","29.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being financially challenged and completely unmotivated to get the permits to own these guns, this wonder was set aside.\n\nThat's when I saw World of Guns. "A gun simulator where I can take apart guns to see how they work?" I said. "What's the catch?"\nThe catch is that it's free-to-play, and that comes with all of the normal trappings of free-to-play games. Several other reveiws have been comparing this to a Facebook game for a good reason; lots of grinding, lots of repitition, lots of soft paywalls, and there's even incentives to invite your friends to play.\n\nThe game itself is rather enjoyable and novel, and is about what it says on the tin. You disassemble, then reassemble, a firearm. The amount of guns there are is staggering. Name any gun from any modern-military FPS you know of; it's in the game, and you can take it apart, and even see how the parts work together while it's firing. You unlock the first few guns quickly, but the cost of guns later on increases, and the only way to gain more currency is through repetition. If you're looking to shoot actual things, there are firing ranges, but they're far from the main attraction and probably shouldn't be what you're spending your time looking at.\n\nThe repetition itself isn't too terrible. By the time you're forced to start repeating builds to get more currency, you've a decent selection of guns to play with, and each gun has it's own set of achievements to complete that help you earn currency. These achievements are repeateable, but subsequent completions don't give you as much cash as the first. The achievements range from simple completion to speed-run awards, and even reward you for having the best time on the ladder for the day.\n\nWhen playing, it may be better to see the game as a thematic, informative speed puzzle centered around guns. I've gotten quite a bit of enjoyment with this mindset and have killed several hours of time this way. However, as the cost of guns rises, it may become less and less feasible to continue playing, but it depends on your level of involvement.\n\nI reccomend only to people who think guns are neat and/or like to do fast-paced puzzles.","June 6, 2014","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not violent at all really, even thought it does have 8 shooting ranges.  I love the game for it's mechanical aspect, how I can take a gun apart, put it back together, see how it works, and, occasionally, shoot a bunch of targets with it. loads of fun if you're into memorizing things, are a hands on learner, or are just plain OCD (and i'm all 3 :)).  A must-try if not a must-love, and i haven't even bought any DLC to go with it.  For the harcore gamers, I'll have to suggest hardcore mode (a bit obviously) where you have to juggle all the parts at once instead of sequentially.\n\nEDIT: The newer objectives dissuade me from playing the game anymore, since it feels like I got all of my achievement maximizations for nothing.","August 8, 2014","true","72.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

World of guns: Gun Disassembly is a unique 'game' if I've ever seen one.\nYou start off with a classic Kalashnikova and work your way up to a colt, not much of a spoiler there. but yeah.\nThe game is all about unlocking things; Field strip your gun to unlock dissasembly, dissasembly your gun to unlock reassembly... Assemble to operation, operation to game, game to super game and super game to hardcore game. You can geuss what the first three are; Operation is using the various features on a gun, changing handgrips, firing it, attaching a silencer or even folding a stock. The games however are a test to see your memory of how to put a gun together, you get bonus points and kudos if you manage to do it without touching the wrong part or taking a hint. On super game and up its instant failure to touch the wrong part and there is no hints.\n\nYou might be thinking "okay thats easy" well... I've spent a bit of time getting raged at a gun for getting one peice wrong or forgetting what came first. A few times the game screws you over by saying "YOU NEED TO DO THIS FIRST" even though there are other points where you do the same thing and the game lets you.\n\nExample: You need to attach two rods to a plate and put the springs back on. One gun lets you put a rod and then the string on before having to deal with the second rod. But this particular gun needs both to be on.\n\nIts a bit annoying when some guns let you do it and doing it for real lets you do it.\n\nOn the graphics end of it. The outside of the gun, looks awesome. 10/10 texturing. On the inside though... many parts have 'brush' texturing. This means that they are all are very basic tons of grey and black. Honestly they're just shaped blocks at that point, a mere representative. No complaint unless your obbscessed with HD textures.\n\nOn the of the guns themselfves. TONS of variety. I find quite a few guns I like in their collection, however... I need to sift through alot of guns I don't cary about at all just to get to them. Sure you can buy the starter pack or the full unlock... but whats the fun of that? Well, i'll tell you: total access. Unless you got alot of time and patience, you won't get through this game without paying. Because the awarded points for working with a single gun almost never total enough to unlock a new one. Sure the points increase as you move on up... but the points needed per gun almost quadruple. So it makes playing fairly hard to do. Also you cannot earn any points through the ranges, I do not suggest unlocking them unless you really like the guns your using alot. Plus its just challenges and not free shooting; you also cannot repeat the challenges once you finish. The graphics for the range also take a plunk, going to CS 1.6 esque graphics. AKA Crappy world textures and okay gun textures.\n\nThere is also another few ways to unlock points (two of them broken for me, reinstalling to see if it fixes it for me).\nFirst is coming back every day. Don't laugh you get a points bonus for coming back so many days in a row; even if you only pop in the grab that bonus. But make sure you come back every day or it'll reset.\nNext method is by joining the group and inviting freinds. I managed to join the group... but now it won't let me invite freinds because the button for it does not function. I have even used the other method in game and it still doesn't work. but this gives you some credits and a ton of XP to use on unlocking guns. But, I can't use it because it's broken.\nLast method is the quiz (which has a high failure rate for me... figures)\nQuizes test your ability to recognize the gun models, the more you get right is the more XP you get to walk away with. Get one wrong though and you lose your shot and get locked out for 2 hours.\n\nThe funniest thing about the quiz not working for me is that it will go through just fine, but it will basically not give me the button to collect my points. It will however (even though I got all the questions right) lock me out for 2 hours. Its interesting to note that is registers me as unable to take another quiz... but yet I get none of my earned points. It only occasionally gives me my points for the quiz, if not... it basically locks the game up because it doesn't give me the button. CRAZIEST THING IS... If I fail the quiz, it doesn't crash at all. I feel like they're trying to keep me from getting points... Cheeki ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nAnyways I'm reinstalling, still voting positive for this game. Even though its got a bunch of Cheeki Breeki coders.","June 19, 2014","true","72.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So if your hobby includes firearms then get it. I'm not too fond of in game purchases but it looks like you can at least unlock most things without paying anything. Also not too fond of how your forced to do a tutorial but at least it is short. I don't know if this is so much a game as an informative application with some game like concepts. So if your like me and will be paying money to get the models I own and the ones on my wish list and not worrying about unlocking things, then I highly recommend this. If your not into firearms then I would probably not recommend it.\n","May 22, 2014","true","19.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The quantity of props is also astonishing, even if it mostly includes military guns and vehicles (apart from some other extra props, like the skeletons).\nStill with all of this, the game could benefit with removing some interesting and fun leveling up moments, while making every model available from the start, since people might want to use this as a tool to help them with cleaning or troubleshooting their firearms.\n\nAll and all, highly recomend!

World of Guns: Gun Disassembly is all about real world weapons. It is not a violent game. Main part of the game is about disassembling and assembling your gun. There are a lot of different weapons, some with few and some with many parts, and about each month there is released a new one. You can play this free game the way you like. When you are only interested in how to dismantle your weapon, go ahead. Want to know how it works? Use slow motion and cutaway views. But you can also play on time and try to beat the daily number 1 or try to get a place in the top 100. It's all up the you. Disassembling and assembling and operating your weapon is giving you experience points, with which you can unlock new guns. When preferred you can buy the game (not a cheap game, but this week 50% off!), which unlocks all weapons at once. Or you can buy parts of the game like e.g. WW2 weapons. The free game takes longer to collect the needed points for unlocking a new weapon but there are no other restrictions. So why not give it a try! As for me, it's a fun game to play and I can really recommend it.

You won't find many bad textures. It's far from realistic, in my opinion, though.\n\nArtstyle: 2/10\nExtremely simplistic. I'm not saying it should be all explosions and super action, but the game doesn't do too much to make you want to look at it.\n\nAtmosphere: None\nNo mutiplayer, no singleplayer... you just choose a gun and (dis)assemble it. It's not possible to immerse yourself into the game.\n\nSound: 5/10\nPretty average. I'm not sure if firing sounds are recorder real guns' sounds.\n\nControls: 4/10\nIt could enrage people how clunky it is. You can accidentally move your mouse to wrong direction, if you're doing the best time you can.\n\nGameplay: 6/10\nNot much to "play" other than disassembling and assembling guns. And it's pretty linear. You can also fire guns on a firing range.\n\nStory: None\nNo story. You will only like the game if you like guns.\n\n\nOverall: 7/10\nNote: "Overall" is my personal rating of how the game "feels" to me in general, not each point taken together.

The quantity of props is also astonishing, even if it mostly includes military guns and vehicles (apart from some other extra props, like the skeletons).\nStill with all of this, the game could benefit with removing some interesting and fun leveling up moments, while making every model available from the start, since people might want to use this as a tool to help them with cleaning or troubleshooting their firearms.\n\nAll and all, highly recomend!

And when I say that it reminds me of World of Tanks, I mean that I don't like it one bit.\n\nIn this game you start off with the original ''bad guy gun'', also known as the Avtomat Kalashnikov 47 (AK-47). You have to learn step-by-step how to assemble and disassemble the gun very carefully and as fast as possible to unlock achievements and score the highest scores. However, to unlock a new weapon, you need to earn a lot of experience. For example, unlocking the gun after the AK-47, the Colt M1911, is a piece of cake because it only asks for 2000 experience points that you can easily unlock right after completing most of the challenges on the Kalashnikov, however, after the Colt, the experience cost dramatically rises to 5000 and then keeps getting higher and higher.\n\nWith this massive experience cost, the game's grind rises dramatically which turns most of the players away from the game, seeking an easier alternative. The easiest alternative in the game, however, is to open your wallet and pay up. Yes, that's right, to unlock all of the guns, you can simply pay for DLCs. Pay-to-win, anyone?\n\nIf you seek an enjoyable game in which you want to access all the sweet, juicy firearms and assemble/disassemble them all, test them and stuff, then this is not the game for you. Please wait for a better alternative.","June 15, 2014","false","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's very interesting to see the workings of all the models without having to own them and get a reputation as a murderous lunatic. That, and actually since you can hide parts and slow down time while watching the weapons operate, it gives some insights into the gun that most people wouldn't be able to uncover with equipment they have at home even if they owned it.\n\nThe biggest problem for me is that the game is ever so slightly skittish on the virtual currency and clearly tries to goad the player into forking out some cash. This would be no problem otherwise, but I don't want to buy the exp straight out as it's the pacing that keeps the game interesting, nor do I want to unlock weapons directly, for the same reason. The boosters are cheaply done; they only last an hour and are much too expensive. The only real incentive to spend money I see here is stickers and other cosmetics for the guns, which I'm not all that interested in. In fact I find the ability to customize the guns with bright colors, animal prints and stick-on pictures a bit tacky.\n\nSomething I could see myself pay for would be a premium version where I can take apart all the weapon accessories I normally only get to see attached in operation mode. The differences between skeleton, wooden and synthetic stocks could be interesting, for example. Or maybe being able to operate weapons with parts taken off (and getting to see malfunctions, dry fire, etc). For the right price I could pay for these features even gun by gun.","March 2, 2015","true","31.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'll recommend it to people who have weird compulsive disorders and like meticulously taking things apart piece by piece, and seeing how it works, because that's all you do in this game. And it's awesome. And it's /free/.\n\nWhat's not awesome is that you have to invite friends to the game to unlock certain features, and the game really stunts your ability to progress like any other social/casual/f2p game. It's fine, because they have to make money somehow.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're willing to take apart the same weapons a few times and wait a day inbetween binging sessions, you can easily get enough points to progress without spending a cent! Can't beat that deal.\n\nIt's great fun if you're super weird and like taking stuff apart; that's pretty much it. Just try it. It's 90 MBs and free.

Very relaxing. The actual process is exhaustively accurate (or at least aspires to be - I don't own a gun myself that I can cross-check their work with.) If a given part could not be removed in reality without removing another part, the game makes you do it in the correct order. It also forces you to deal with parts so small that they don't initially seem to be there even on a close examination. "Plastic" mode colors all the parts differently in bright neon colors to make them stand out more, useful in these cases. A competitive element that you can engage or ignore freely - each gun has leaderboards you can compare yourself against. There's also cars and skeletons to disassemble, although only a handful of each, and a motorcycle and two military vehicles. The game includes shooting ranges and challenges to allow you to play with the guns as well as just examine them, but it appears that not all guns have corresponding ranges. Out of the five I've unlocked, only two have such levels.\n\nCons: You start with only three models - AK-47. 1911, and a human skeleton (under bonus models.) To unlock more guns, you have to either save up experience points or spend real-world money. If you're willing to spend money, you unlock guns quite quickly. To do it through XP, you have to grind. That's slow - I'm seven hours in, and have unlocked just three additional guns. (Keep in mind that each gun I have encountered so far takes no more than ten minutes to completely disassemble and re-assemble - and that's the first time attacking a relatively complex gun like the AK. The TEC-9, clocking in at less than forty parts, took just five minutes total, and judging by the leaderboards, I'm slow.)\n\nWhat's more, guns unlock in a specific order along a tree like a Civ V tech tree, except that it goes in multiple directions. You have to unlock eight guns to get to the Garand, for instance, and those eight guns take you in the opposite direction from the Desert Eagle, for another example. You cannot actually see the whole tree to begin with, either. You see the next guns available to unlock, and you can see vague outlines of the ones after that with no names or detail. After that, nothing. You have to consult charts made by other players to plan your unlocks more than two steps ahead. There's also a handful of guns that can be unlocked only with purchased credits. There are often  guns beyond these that can only be accessed by getting through that one gun - so while they're "free," you can't get at them without having paid. Virtually all of the respectable handful of non-gun models are paid-credits only, as well.\n\nConclusion: It's good for killing a few hours here or there, but completionists should be aware that it is impossible to 100 percent this title without paying, and everyone should be aware that what progress you can make is made only at a comparative crawl.","January 10, 2015","true","40.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Basically for all you civi's I fixed guns.\n\nThis game gets down to the nitty gritty of every gun i have worked on and im pretty damn impressed. What makes this more fun for me is i also get to dissassemble guns i have never worked on and actually seeing how they operate is pretty awesome.Every little spring and pin that the M9 has to make you rage is all there to make it for a realistic experience. I also own 9 different types of guns and starting off with the Ak made me smile from the get go.\n\nIf you dont know your ♥♥♥♥ when it comes to guns and dont wanna learn it i suggest you stay away. This is for sure more of a game for gun nuts and people who actually have hands on experience. I did purchase the 10 dollar started pack but the game is FREE!\n\nAll thats basically missing is the feeling you get when a M249 Op rod comes flying out the back of the Saw an pushes your two teeth in.\n10/10","June 28, 2014","true","68.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Boy, was I wrong, it's basically a Puzzle, Memory type of game where you learn how to take apart and reassemble real weaponery. Once I found out what the game had to offer I was hooked. I find it quite good and a little addicting. It's very casual too, hop in for 5 minutes or 1 hour. It's not like most games out there that really impose on your time to get something done.\n\nThe game is free, you only start with one gun but it's easy to get points to unlock other guns. So it's NO WHERE near a pay2play. I have around 11 guns now and enough points to probably buy two more guns depending on what I want. I actually feel quite guilty because I have not yet paid for on of the packs the game does offer which are around $10. I mean it's so cool of a game that I'd like to support the Development team.\n\nI don't know if this review will help much but if you get anything from it, learn from my mistake. I thought the game was stupid looking and almost passed it by but once I tried it I found out how great it is. Don't make my mistake.\n\nAt the very least yoou can learn how to take apart and then put back together an AK47 Assault Rifle or Colt 45 Handgun :)","March 26, 2015","true","37.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was wrong.\n\nThe developers put a lot of work into this game.  The models in-game are based on real world models.  Every part is labeled with it's correct name, down to the smallest pins, rollers and springs.  If you are detail oriented, mechanically-minded, or simply curious, this will be up your alley!\n\nWhether you are a firearm enthusiast or simply wondered how firearms function, check this "game" out.  I don't even consider this to be a game, but more of a fun educational tool with games on the side.\n\nThere are "pay" aspects, but only if you want to progress faster or move onto a subject other than guns, such as military vehicles, race cars, even skeletons, etc.  As for progression within the "gun" world, it's free.\n\nThe game consists of assembly, dis assembly, function, games (including a firing range) and even painting the firearms.  You can try to disassemble then reassemble as fast as you can, without "hasty" clicks, and without errors for extra points.  It's very challenging (and I'm adept at this using actual firearms).\n\nThe X-ray feature allows the player to see inside a firearm, even while firing, reloading, safety on-off, etc.  This is what I liked the most about it.\nIn the real world, one can take apart an actual gun, learn the names of the parts, and understand the basic functions; but to see the pieces in action (while inside the gun) gives us a better understanding of how all the parts work together.\n\nThe models are pretty good looking too.  They aren't super high res, but they aren't low-res either.\n\nMy only two complaints with this game:\n- The way one moves around the gun/parts to get a different angle is awkward, sometimes frustrating, but it's not game-breaking bad...not by any means; just an annoyance at times.\n\n- Some areas of the breakdown and assembly are draconian when it shouldn't be.  For example:  the AK-47, one does not have to remove the accessories pouch from the rifle-butt BEFORE removing the rifle-butt (in real life).  The game penalizes the player if the pouch isn't removed first though.\nThis problem is more of a developer's attitude of "You have to follow MY procedure, even if it's not necessary in the real world".  This is not game-breaking either, but VERY frustrating when trying to go from start to finish with zero errors.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game, 100%.\n\n9/10","April 9, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For everyone else, a more traditional shooting game will be much more well received.\n\nEdit:\nEven though the game is free, I'd recommend buying the Lifetime Access thing if you put learning about guns before the game-y aspect of unlocking each one at a time, as it takes a while and the unlock trees don't make much sense.","March 6, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It's also surprisingly detailed it just needs links to gun suppliers to show where you can get your spare parts from. I'm unsure of it being a game concept.

Each gun costs XP to buy, and when you complete stages like taking apart the gun, putting the gun together, firing the gun, using the gun at a shooting range, speed-disassembling/assembling the gun, etc. you get XP.\n\nHowever, XP isn't HARD to get, it's just...ANNOYING.\n\nThe problem with this is that you get WAY to little XP to unlock anything before you become bored. I don't think I made it anywhere past 4 guns (AK47, M1911, MP5, Beretta). To get required XP, you will need to constantly go back and play all of these games OVER and OVER again. It gets boring, trust me.\n\nI GUESS it would be good to buy the DLC for this, but honestly, just trust me, using it for something like this might not be the best idea.\n\nIs it a bad game? Well, sort of. They tried to make it a game, but I feel like just making it an interactive thing would have been much better and I would have given it a higher score. It's really interesting how you can do this stuff, and the guns are great, but since it's so annoying to get the XP needed to unlock the guns, you probably won't get to a lot of them. If they just lowered the XP required or dropped the "free to play", put a cheap price tag on it, and then unlocked all of the guns, that would be better. It IS great for gun enthusiasts, though, and I guess it wouldn't hurt to try it because it is free.","November 6, 2014","false","23.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

BEFORE I downloaded it. THEN after spending an hour or so I found it to be a TOTAL DRM P.O.S.. I mean, you have to frigg'n be ONLINE just to play this thing... WTH?\n\nEVERY time you want o "play"/ disassemble/Assemble a gun, the game has to REDOWNLOAD the model... WHY?? SUppose you live where the internet conenction is bad, or your camping and want to goof off after a long days hike on your laptop. NOOOOOO....\n\nEven the shooting ranges are limited, cause it's only for one kind fo gun. You can pick the kindof shooting range you want, choose whatever gun you want and start popping off shots. NO. It's whatever they want to give you, and only a SMALL fraction of guns get to be used in the shooting range.\n\nThe game is constanly telling you how much more EXP you could have earned by buying a booster pack, and even forking out $40 doesn't unlock every item (good thing I only got the free version.)\n\nDisassembly is dumbed down too. Oh sure, some models require you to remove every screw, but, ONLY for that region. Even then most guns assemble+disassemble as an assembly, meaning a group of parts com apart at the simple click of a button. I really don't feel like you learn much.\n\nTextures range from realisic, to flat out lazy. The AK and 1911 are very pretty, but guns like the Tech 9 sport few convincing textures (especially the barrel assembly.) The game goes so far as to tell you you can unlock any gun at any time... IF YOU PAY MONEY....\n\nWhile the multiple X-Ray modes, attchments are cool, there's really nothing redeeming about this at all. If I were to actually get a copy that didn't require the internet to even use and still required money to buy, I'd might consider it. But inthe end, it's really a Modern-day corrupt app.\n\nAnd I don't are if the Devs say: "Well, we want to preven piracy." To heck with that noise, this exact philosophy is what made sooooooooooo many gamers ticked off about the original features of the X-Box 1. So... Why bother with games like that at all. I don't care if this is more of a simulator than a game, I care about integrity, and I find this game to stink to high noon with questionable business practices.\n\n------------- REAL GAMERS DON'T NEED THEIR WALLETS TO UNLOCK FEATURES.

I see many potential ways to have fun in the game, and in the end even if you don't have any fun assembling, disassembling, and operating the guns the game has to offer, there are other models in the game including skeletons, cars, and motorcycles. Really there is quite a bit of fun to be had if you go into the game looking at it like a puzzle/ sim game and you may even learn something about the way guns operate and how they are manufactured and/ or assembled. If that's the sort of thing for you, you should also know there are statistics and info for each gun available if you want to know more information about whatever one you are interested in.\n\nNot all aspects of the game are enjoyable (at least for me) after a point you will hit grind (unless you pay) and grind is the polar opposite of fun most, if not all of the time. There is also a requirement (for some content) to invite friends to the game. Now I know that it might not sound bad to need to invite friends to play the game, but if your like me and most of your steam friends don't play these types of games you will run into an issue fairly quickly. Even if your friends will play, you don't want to end up looking like a spamming jerk do you? In the end I think you should just download the game yourself, (ts pretty small so it shouldn't  take long) and try it, after all only you can tell if you like it.","May 22, 2014","true","4.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The detail, the fun and everything. Only 1 thing brought it all the way down. It is that it will take ages (by ages, I mean AGES) for you to actually unlock a new gun.\n\nGetting XP to unlock a gun will take a long time. You can reassemble and disassemble guns again and again, but it won't give you that much of XP. The only sustainable way of getting XP is the daily reward, which is flawed by itself. Everyday, you get more and more XP (100, 200, 500...) until 3000. Think that it will help you out? I thought the same too. But then, after reaching 3000, on day 7, the count restarted to the measly 100. So much for 'coming on everyday and this reward will increase!'\n\nSo if you count the daily rewards that you can get in a week, that tallys up to 6800, which at first seems like a lot. But eventually, you have to unlock guns that cost almost twice that amount. So... you just have two weeks of opening and closing the game before you can get to any action.\n\nWhen I play, I always ask myself, what's the point of having so many guns if you can't even use them? The price to unlock all the guns is ridiculous too. 50 dollars?? You might as well just add 10 bucks to it and get Battlefield 4 or something.\n\nIn conclusion, this game could have worked out brilliantly. Only a flawed daily reward system and the crazy amount of time needed to progress brings it down all the way. 3/10 stars","July 6, 2014","false","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In case you did not know, Noble Empire created an app called Gun Disassembly II a long time ago.  I, being a fan of going to the local range picked this app up.  That was two years ago.  I have since paid $.99 for 105 guns, not to mention the extra money I spent on the Car Disassembly and the Body Disassembly apps.  You may wonder why this is important.  Well this version of the game requires me to REBUY the items I have previously bought.  Which is funny since the PC application of Gun Disassembly allows me to download my purchases I bought.  If you’re new to this world of disassembly apps & games, get this game but be ready to spend an arm and a leg in two weeks.

Its cool how you can field strip or fully take apart a gun, but for what reward? You'll eventually get to the point where you grind and grind and grind and grind untill you get the next gun. Guess what you have to do next? Yep, grind. The game holds your hand through the entirety of the game (except shooting range). For example, you cannot make mistakes, if you try and put one thing with the wrong component it does nothing. What they should've done (in my opinion) is have some sort of feed back, like show a little animation of the two parts trying to fit together and failing instead of just nothing.\n\nNow on to DLC issues, remember how I was complaining about "grinding" up above? Well you don't have to worry about it! Just shove your credit card into the disc tray, pay $50 and get 100+ guns half of which you won't even touch! Also "4 Cars Pack" and "5 Skeletons Pack"???? Why are there cars and skeletons in a game called "World of GUNS:  GUN  Disassesembly????? I haven't bought these (shocker) but the ideas are cool and I think if they were seperate games. The "10 Shooting Ranges Pack" is completely pointless. The one thing I'm not sure about is if the "World War II Pack" includes guns in the game right now or exclusive guns only in this pack. "Starter Pack" is obvious although it doesn't say what guns are included.\n\nOverall, the game is interesting and quite cool, but the way it performs, with grinding being its main problem, even though this game is free and steam makes games easy to uninstall, its still not worth it.","November 6, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game requires, as previous reveiws have stated, a good bit of grinding to unlock things. True there is a quiz that you can take every two hours that can be slightly rewarding but if you make one mistake you get nothing and have to wait two more hours to take it again. If you want to pay for  unlocks though prepare to spend a fortune as it is not cheap. $15 may get you 2 or 3 normaly later unlocked guns.\n\nAs for the gameply, id say it is very good. The weapons can be fully dissasembled into the smallest componets and put back together again. There is a wide variety of weapons to unlock ranging from a flint lock pistol to assalt rifles, SMGs, sniper rifles, machine guns, and even a couple of artillery cannons.\n\nThis game is deffinetly a very good experience for anyone who is curiose about the opperation of firearms. As well as weapon enthusiests alike.\n\nAll and all for a free to play its not bad. Although it would have been better to have a set price in exchange for all the grinding.\n\n6.5-10\n\nNOTE: To anyone who has previously played the flash version, you account does not go over to steam from what i can see. You will have to start over completly. If you play the flash version do not bother downloading this.","May 21, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However, after playing it for 11 hours, I've noticed a few things that have turned me off it.\n\n1: No way to delete your current progress. This is annoying for me because after leaving it for a few months, I wanted to start again. However, there is no way to do so. At all...\n2: The quiz is stupid. You can correctly identify 7 models, get 1 wrong, and lose all those points. Why don't I get the points for the the 7 models I got right?\n3: You pretty much need to buy extra points after about 10 hours of play. I'm at the point where I have to grind the same models over and over to get one new gun, which then gives me about 30 minutes of fresh entertainment, before it's back to grind-city.\n4: So content is locked off by making it only purchasable by credits, which you can't get by playing the game. Guess what that means? Microstransactions!\n5: Whats worse is that there are achivements linked to content only buyable with credits. So to get about 4-5 of the achivements, you are forced to buy credits.\n\nSo there's my review. A fun game for the first couple of hours, then you hit grind city and all entertainment is lost.","October 9, 2015","false","12.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game itself is good overall (atleast the concept), but e.g. the textures aren't really "2014" I think. The MP5's textures,like the whole shooting range, look just horrible. Also I miss extended graphics options, a slider for the music/sound volumes and more competitions at the shooting range just to name a few. This seems to be some App ported to the PC. Please make it a fair game for players who play this game for free and USE the possibilities and resources the PC gives you as platform. Let us get 5-10 guns easily without grinding for hours or having to pay or make it a (REAL) pay-once game. Use another engine that actually USES the PCs hardware to make everything look actually realistic.\n\nSummary:\nGood concept but looks and feels like a rather bad port from the mobile market just to get more money. If you want PC players to actually PLAY this game make it a real PC game.\nAll in all a 3/10 (like the number of guns you get when you're not paying, being a pro or grinding for hours)","June 27, 2014","false","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","1"

The guns are nicely detailed and you learn quite a lot about each gun functions when it is fired. How ever there are some issues. The Spec Ops feature where yu are ewarded for joining their group and having 5 freinds play the game does not work, I've joined the group and have 6 friends play the game and can not claim the rewards for completeing the objective. Another issue is that any new guns they add to the game require credits, a currency you pretty much have to buy to use on these guns. Sure they run a prmo code to unlock it for free, but they are limited and you have to buy the credits if you want to ulock them. The Exp gain is alright, I wish It was a bit higher, I also wish that the quiz system was worked out better like maybe having a 3 strikes and you lose. Overall I'd rate it a 6/10 pretty fun game, pretty educational, but the Spec Ops being broken, and new guns requireing credits is a bit disappointing. Probably will cgange to a Recommend once the Spec Ops feature is fixed.","June 6, 2014","false","16.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is really cool and awesome to see how some guns work. You get to take them apart, put them back together, paint them, and see how they operate! It is really cool! But man does it take a LONG time to get enough exp to get a gun (at least it does to get an M4), so you might want to plan on spending money if you want a lot of guns. The AK-47 and M1911 are both unlocked through the tutorial though, so if those are guns you are interested in then prepare for a LONG and BORING tutorial. So I would say its worth trying out because it is free (unless you want lots of guns fast).","October 19, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
