I cannot recommend it to anyone, especially if you have ever had problems with a gambling addiction.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe turn based formation combat is entertaining and rather unique. Where you place your mercs and which mercs you use and in what order makes for fun game play and interesting decisions.\n\nThe journal that collects battle info is very well done.\n\nThere are several different pvp and pve activities implemented, allowing you to use your mercs and strategies in different ways against different types of obstacles.\n\nYour mileage may vary, but the people who I met who play this game seemed friendly.  The ones who weren't AFK, that is.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nYour mercs must level up from when you first get them, often placing them far behind your main character and the rest of your team of mercs. Keeping a large stable to switch out for different strategies is not practical for this reason and the cost in real money to buy licenses.\n\nThe artwork in Atlantica Online is dated. This one doesn't bother me that much, but I know people who are put off by such things.\n\nThe depiction of women is insulting; expect nearly any woman in this game to be very buxom, half naked, and usually underage.  The depiction of men is also very shallow.\n\nThe experience required to level your character and your crafting skills drag each process out beyond reason, after a certain grace period.  Many of the quests after a point become a grind by themselves, as well.\n\nYou can recieve free experience for sitting, and many people at high levels afk craft, which rewards alt tabbing the game for long periods of time, leading to a social atmosphere where many if not most of the people logged into the game aren't actually there.\n\nThe North American version of the game is approximately 10 updates behind the Korean version. I estimate that to be about 2 years, perhaps more. Expect whatever bugs they fixed long ago to still be around for you, and whatever features they are accustomed to to still be unavailable to you.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nThis game has the worst item store of any free to play game that I have ever seen. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE A GAMBLING ADDICTION. Two item types, available only through the store, have stats equivalent to the highest level gear or higher, and have no in game available alternatives, meaning that they will be needed to be competitive in pvp, especially at lower levels, and many strategies for fighting higher level, tougher dungeons, will be more difficult, if not impossible, without them. To attempt to buy one of these items you must pay 10 dollars US for a 'box' that might contain the item that you are after. The odds of containing your coveted item are not listed in the store, but the internet suggests 5% or less. The cost to buy the points needed is also not listed in the store, without first giving up your credit card information. I found it through internet searches. Finally, there are four powerful mercs available through the item store, which will also be difficult to progress in higher level content without, and needed to be competitive in pvp even at low levels. Each costs fifty dollars US plus twenty to thirty more for any skill up books, depending on if you bought a bundle or not. For comparison, a newly released major company video game typically costs 50 to 60 dollars, if it's 18 months to 2 years old it typically costs 30, and for something 5 years old or more, as many good turn based games are, 5 to 10 dollars.\n\nFinally, customer service tickets take a ridiculously long time to be answered, if they are ever answered at all. There are people in the forums that have been waiting for six months on unanswered tickets about serious issues such as account or item theft.\n\nMy suggestion to anyone considering this game would be to spend less time and money than you would spend trying to succeed at this game buying several turn based games from steam and from gog. If you enjoy the few redeeming qualities enough to play it anyway, at least know what you're getting into.","March 25, 2014","false","29.4"," 66 of 90 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","66","90","3","11"

Even before NDoors was bought out, it was pay2win after level 100. Each level cap increased the grind exponentially to the point that lv120+ you are lucky to get 1 level a week of hardcore grinding. PvP is broken now because they sell OP heroes in the cash shop (for ♥♥♥♥ing $70 each) and PvE's focus has changed from the "classic" 3v3 grid combat they shown in the trailer to a FFT multiplayer style mission based mode called TBS. This may sounds cool but it is incredibly laggy, unoptimized, even more repetitive than the 3v3 combat, and the reward system is unbalanced (they encourage you to play mutliplayer maps solo). Nowadays all anyone does is grind TBS maps solo, sit AFK in town crafting, or AFKing through PvP.\n\nThis game is 100% Pay2Win. You can gamble to upgrade your weapons with cash shop items, You can buy gamble boxes for mounts that give you better stats than all your armor combined.\n\nDo not touch this.","June 29, 2012","false",""," 39 of 52 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","39","52","3","0"

The first 100 levels were great, and then the grind began at 100. The best classes are worth millions, if not billions of in-game gold to obtain. Across a level 50 and two level 100 characters, I barely made 1 billion gold, with plenty of market playing. Getting the stuff to do the quest essentially drained me of all of my savings, leaving me with nothing to buy gems, which is how you upgrade the characters at certain level milestones. Not only that, the better the character, the more expensive the upgrades will be. These upgrades can't be ignored either, as they give huge boosts to their stats, making them worthless at higher levels when left in their basic form. So this 1 billion class was going to cost me several billions more just to upgrade it as many times as my weaker, but cheaper characters.\n\nAfter going back to the game after some time, I saw the new classes and how much their summon gems were selling on the market. Trillions. All because they are cash shop exclusive, and are by far the strongest characters in the game. At this point, anyone going completely F2P is screwed out of all their work, and hit a huge grinding wall that will never end. By the time the money is earned to buy any one of these classes, a new, stronger class will be created you will have to pay quadrillions for.\n\nIf anyone at all is still thinking about trying this game and you see this, don't. You might enjoy it for quite a good number of hours, but are forced to pay or get out if you wanna get anywhere close to the mid-game, and a lot more to reach even a mile away from the end-game. Just don't, unless you want your heart broken like mine.","August 21, 2015","false","146.8"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","28","34","0","0"

The only reason for playing now is working the market, which is dominated by tradeable cash-shop items and their consequential inflation effect. The advertised combat style and dungeon exploration has been eschewed in place of spammable "mini-game" style dungeons that require semi-AFK clicking every few minutes. And, in natural Nexon style, this cheesy side-grade is the only way to acquire some of the best gear.\n\nAfter hundreds of hours spent on the game before Nexon acquired it, and a hundred more recently trying to get back into the game, I simply cannot recommend anyone keep Atlantica alive any longer than it needs to be.\n\nThere are very few reasons for veteran players to return, and even less for new players to begin. Atlantica is a monument; a memory of greatness once before.","July 2, 2012","false","146.4"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","29","36","3","0"

In the end, you should play it; this isn't another game, this is a completely different genre from anything you've ever played.  When this game dies, this genre of video games will be dead and there will never be another like it.  My heart goes out to Atlantica Online (AO) for that reason; the PvP is easily the most challenging thing I've ever done in a game, the features and design of the game are unique, there's a lot of quirks you don't find in other MMOs, and the community is great.  But at the same time, if you play this game you need to have your expectations set right.  Nexon is not the best company, the item mall is terrible, the max level is 170 and it's taken some people almost a decade to reach that, and you will never catch up to the top ranked PvP'ers without spending thousands of dollars (I'm not exaggerating).  You have to be ok with knowing that you'll never be the best, and you have to just want to enjoy the ride.\n\nThe Best Parts:\n\n-You'll never play another game like this.  It's unique, it's challenging in all the right ways, and it's so addicting.\n\n-PvP is an absolute gem.  Let me break it down for you...each player has a 3x3 grid of characters, so 9 total.  Each character has physical attacks and magical attacks.  Each physical attack gives 1 stun counter to your opponent.  At 3 stun counters their character is stunned for 3 turns.  There's various weapons, some hit a column, some it a row, some hit a single target or a cross shape.  As for the magical attacks, they all have some sort of special effect such as Silence, movement limitations, etc.  Each character has a "Monk" who can either remove stun counters or remove debuffs each turn.  So the game revolves around trying to trick your opponent and force them into hard decisions.  For example, a Monk removes dubuffs by putting up a magic shield that lasts for 2 turns, so once that shield is up they can't heal or remove stun counters.  Which means you can put up 1 stun counter, and then on the next turn both debuff them and put up the 2nd stun counter, forcing your opponent to chose between keeping the debuff or letting them get stunned.  But at the same time, they can do the same to try and disable you from putting up those stun counters, or disable your character with the debuff and make you pick a less favorable debuff to put up on them; so you have to plan ahead.  There's trillions of variables that can also come into play such as guarding, scrolls, changing places.  Each player gets 5 moves per turn, oh, and everything has to be done within 30 seconds.  So you have 30 seconds to spend your moves, and then 30 seconds to memorize your opponents moves and plan accordingly.\n\n-The community is great.  Guilds have a lot of incentive to stay together.  Everyone knows everyone else so they're all civilized.  It's a smart game, it's attracts smart players who like learning.  The community also has ways of policing itself through things like Nations.  A nation is a group of guilds, they can invite guilds to join them or kick out troublesome guilds.  Nations collect points over time that can be spent on items and bonuses.  There's also raid dungeons that require a whole Nation to do.  Nations can also do something called "Kings Judgment" which lets a guild leader mark any player in the game, and then anybody in the Nation can kill that player.  If you abuse that power, other Nations will in turn come after you, Nations can go to war, but they can potentially lose things like cities and the amount of economy they control.\n\n-The Economy is cool.  I'm not much of a entrepreneur, or a crafter but I do really like that the economy is 99% player controlled.  Items don't exist unless players craft them and crafters need resources from things like Nations and PvE.  The game even has a list of the servers best crafters for each type of craft.  It's an MMO feature that you no longer find in newer games.\n\n-There's so many events!  Seriously, and they're cool events too.  They give away free mounts and costumes, experience boosts, all sorts of great items.  A lot of the events are interactive.  They'll have minigames, or temporary event dungeons, or random world monster drops.  The events are so random and interesting.\n\nThe Worst Parts:\n\n-You will never catch up.  Never.  Don't even try.  For example the PvP's grand tournament that happens cross-server every Sunday afternoon is still fun.  But when the tournament narrows down, it's always the same 10 players or so.  There used to be more variety back when the level cap wasn't 170 and the game was newer.  But now days, the older players have accumulated so much wealth that they're levels and equipment simply make them better.  Which sucks because the tournament used to be the best way to spectate good strategic matches between the best of the best.  It's not like that anymore.  Most of the people at the top aren't even that good; they're just rich.\n\n-The equipment grinds would be fun if they weren't so expensive.  Sure, they're not really necessary, and you can competitively PvP without them.  But there's 170 levels to this game.  People who play 24/7 for years haven't even reached the level cap.  You have a lot of incentive to upgrade gear because it cuts down on the grind.  Here's how the system works; you have two Flame Swords, so you combine them, and now you have a Flame Sword +1.  Then you go find another Flame Sword +1, combine that with the one you currently have, and then you have a Flame Sword +2.  The max is +9, which means you have to get two weapons to +8 and then combine them to make a +9.  That's 81 swords total that you consume.  You could also gamble and "Enhance" your sword directly from +8 to +9 without the additional +8 but there's a 50% chance the Enhance will fail and you'll lose the weapon permanently.  The best seller on the item mall is this item called "Atlas Ore" which lets you Enhance without losing your weapon permanently should it fail. Atlas Ore is literally so important that it's the sole factor in determining the strength of the economy.  But most people never gear up past +4.\n\n-The item mall is silly.  For example, the "Vampire" character on the item mall is $70.  That character is also a healer and a staple in the highest levels of PvP because she has a powerful heal that lasts over time and heals in a column rather than a row like the rest of the healers in the game.  That makes her a great sniper prevention tool.  It doesn't matter at lower levels.  But there's a few game changing mercenaries on the item mall.  And seriously, $70?  Oh Nexon, it's like you have no self awareness.  Luckily, the Vampire is really the only character who affects PvP, the others are game changers in PvE however.  And as other reviews will tell you, the item mall is also all about gambling.  If Nexon releases a new mount on the item mall, you can't just buy that mount.  You have to buy a "box" that when you open rolls dice and you have a random chance at getting the mount.  You /could/ get the mount, or you /could/ get something so worthless that your money would have been better spent on $50 worth of Atlas Ore that you can sell to players.  The game also attaches huge stat bonuses to mounts and costumes (which can be upgraded to +9 by the way .)\n\n-New Characters start at level 1.  Ok cool, so you want to try adding the new character that was just released to your team.  But the rest of your team is at level 136 and it took you over 300 hours to get your current team to that point.  Ok have fun!  There are things like experience boosts.  But even with those it's a pain.\n\n-You have to do everything 9 times. You have 9 characters, each with their own equipment, experience table, skill tree,  and what not.\n\n-This is the International Version and it tends to update more slowly compared to the Korean Version","October 28, 2015","true","78.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

It's a decent game and one of the very few turn based MMOs that has a good battle system, the gameplay itself is solid and mostly fun and there are many ways to build a successful group of mercs, there are a few cookiecutter setups for specific purposes like pvp or TBS farming but you can play the game without using one of them.\n\nIf you don't have a ton of time to dedicate to the game you can still progress for a while as a casual player but eventually you'll hit a wall and have to either spend real money or be able to solo farm the big payout TBS missions to fund upgrades so you don't constantly die. Sadly, overall I'd have to say I don't recommend this game. A year or so ago I definitely would have but there have been too many changes that try to force people to spend money by changing game elements into something else or even taking core elements of the game out and replacing them with cash grabs.\n\n\nNow for the full review.\n\nDon't let the low playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours in this game off and on over the years. I started playing way back when ndoors still ran it and the pay to win aspect was present back then, but once nexon took over it became a whole different ballgame altogether. Anyone who's familiar with some of nexon's other games will know how they try to milk players for every cent they can squeeze out of them and this game is no exception. It's somewhat hidden here though, most of the stuff you need to get ahead is equipment and that's not sold in the cash shop, what a lot of people do is buy stuff from the cash shop then sell it in game and use the money they make to buy good gear from other players.\n\nAnyone with gambling issues SHOULD NOT play this game as that is what almost the entire cash shop is based on, there are no direct purchases aside from the cash shop mercs and atlas ore, everything else from costumes to mounts comes in a box that has an estimated (based on numbers run by several players while opening hundreds of boxes) less than 5% chance at actually giving you the item you're after and will usually give some random crap like scrolls or merc upgrade items.\n\nWhen you start off it's cheap, easy, and quick to craft and upgrade gear but toward endgame you're almost required to use atlas ore to upgrade, as the equipment itself is prohibitively expensive to sacrifice on combining and it's not worth the risk of taking it to the NPC, atlas has a chance at failure but unlike the upgrade NPC the item isn't destroyed, it loses an upgrade level which suckers you into using even more atlas ore to get it back to where it was before you started trying to upgrade.\n\nAnd regarding crafting it's a decent way to make money for a while, but later on it actually starts costing more money to buy materials to craft than you'd get by selling the equipment you make. Crafting itself is a gamble, because you have a chance to craft equipment that's up to +6 (maximum upgrade is +10), and with higher level gear (130+) you needed to get +2 just to break even on the cost of materials. Even getting +1 is very rare though, most often you end up with no +.\n\nThe pay to win aspect is somewhat mitigated by almost all cash shop items being sellable/tradeable, so it's possible (though difficult) to play without spending a dime if you know how to make the crazy amounts of money in game required to purchase those things. However, if you have money you're willing to throw at this game to get ahead your best bet is to buy atlas ore which is used for too many things to list and always has a huge market.\n\nThe game itself scales somewhat well at least, there are higher ranked mercs you can get from quests and you absolutely do not have to get the cash shop mercs if you don't plan on being competitive in pvp, there are perfectly good setups using only recruited mercs although some of the recruitable mercs require rare items only available from nation dungeons which you need A). To be in a guild that's part of a nation able to run them and B). Be lucky enough to actually get that drop or for someone in the nation who does get it be willing to sell/give it to you, OR C). the astronomical amount of money needed to buy the merc recruitment item from someone and skip the quest.\n\n\n\nSince I've started playing again I've noticed a few major changes I do not like at all, and I'm going to assume if you're reading this part you've played before and know what these things are. Individual merc inventory was removed and you now get inventory equal to a full party, but your mercs at home or in the merc room don't carry anything beyond what they're equipped with, anything that was in their inventory previously gets dumped into the new "personal warehouse" that's accessible from almost anywhere. To be fair it is huge and has 2 pages, but it's a rental and you get 90 days that starts counting down the instant you log in. The worst part is there is no license for it so the only way to renew it is pay once the time runs out.\n\nExpeditions were also removed and replaced with "merc training", you have to pay gold for each merc in the training squad AND have a merc training license (which sometimes drops from bonus mobs) for each one of them to start training. Essentially it went from a way to level mercs and make a little money on the side from selling the loot to having to spend money to level them.\n\nIndependant mercs were removed as well and the rare items obtainable from them were put into the old treasure boxes you get from bonus monsters. I haven't seen any of them yet from opening OTB though, and talking to people in my nation several of them have opened thousands of OTB and gotten 1 or 2 Rainbow Soulstones. The failure rate for OTB seems to have been increased as well.\n\nAll in all I don't recommend this game if you're a new player, it's just been made too hard to get anywhere without spending large amounts of money on it. If you've played before and are considering playing again you may or may not get anywhere depending on how far you'd progressed before. The only good thing that's been introduced lately (and I use the term loosely as this a year or so ago) is they finally added an exp share option for regular battles and not just TBS/skirmish so you don't have to drag battles out so your weaker mercs can get kills.","December 4, 2014","false","56.5"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","15","21","2","0"

It is set in an alternate Earth, using the entire globe as a map.  The game mixes places and people from throughout history and legend, so Marco Polo, Miyamoto Musashi, Nefertiti, and William Tell are all here, and Rome is the cultural center.  The basic storyline involves the ressurection and protection of Atlantis.\n\nThe game is free-to-play; there is a market (called the Item Mall) but none of the items sold there are necessary to succeed (though some items are so convenient that they may feel needed.)  This is the English version of a Korean game, so expect a great deal of randomness and a manhwa influence in the art style.\n\nThe player controls an entire party of heroes, starting with their main character and recruiting companions in various ways as they advance through the game.  The maximum party size, including the main, is nine.  Each companion must be trained, advanced, and geared just as the main character must be.  There are multiple modes of combat ranging from static turn-based to a more tactical mode where movement, positioning, and range are important.\n\nOffering a radically different party and combat model for an MMO, Atlantica Online will be of interest to anyone who finds ♥♥♥♥♥♥me design a topic worth exploring.

Pick one of many classes as your main character, and recruit plenty of computer assistants of varying classes to battle along side of you.\n\nYou can have up to 9 in a party (including your main), customize spells, and even battle along the sides of friends and guildmates to make for interesting 27 character battles against enemies in the wild, against opposing guilds, or bosses inside dungeons you run with your guild. While free to play, there are a vast amount of upgrades, rare items, and other trinkets that you may purchase with real money towards the game.

First off, this game is a bit odd. A lot of this is due to it being a Korean game, and while the localization is decent enough, some of the design choices will alienate certain people. The main draw of the game though is it's unique strategy turn-based system, and that alone is the only reason for the recommendation. The combat is a lot of fun, but the actual campaign is an absolute drag. It takes place on Earth, but in an alternate reality? Sorta? I'm not even quite sure myself. For whatever reason whenever I logged back into the game sometimes my character (my freshly made new one) would spawn in Rome, even though I'm supposed to be somewhere in China-ish. I can't fast-travel really, and walking on foot takes forever..... There are many minor nitpicks I could mention here and there, but this would just be a long list of complaints if I did that. In short, if you're completely ok with Korean game design choices, and other minor annoyances, the game is actually pretty fun. The combat is smooth and an absolute blast, and the game looks pretty decent.\n\n7.5/10 Might return to this game out of boredom later","January 4, 2015","true","12.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kdevil/recommended/212240/","kdevil","kDeviL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kdevil/","27 products in account","When I first heard about an MMO with turn based combat I immediately figured it'd be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I mean I loved final fantasy and all that but obviously I only really liked old Jrpgs for their story.  Although their combat was entertaining, I really doubt I would have played them at all without their great stories.  So how could an MMO possibly make it work when the combat is so crucial?  No way it'll be fun..  I was so very wrong.  This game is awesome and the combat is simply genious.\n\nThere are about 40 or 50 mercs that all have a different skillsets and stats, think of them sort of like champions from a Moba.  You can fight with any 9 of them on your team and you unlock higher teir mercs as you play which can't have duplicates.  PvE is actually really fun,  Many of the quests are the typical ones you'll find in MMOs.  However it really doesn't feel grindy because you only ever have like 1 or 2 at a time.  Each time you go to the next hub city, there's an ancient ruin of some sort nearby that you explore. You follow a chain through a couple floors and you have a boss at the end. It's done quite well.\n\nPvP is where this game really blows me away though, I freakin love it.  It's not just 1v1 either, you can have 3v3 fights, each with their 9 mercs.  And there's even Mass PvP with a setup much more like FF tactics and alot of people.  The PvP systems are equally as well done as the execution.  For open world pvp, you can join a guild, which can join a nation, which can go to war with another nation of guilds, guilds can also capture, own and I think tax cities. Though I haven't really gotten this far yet, it sounds awesome.  There are also Leagues every couple hours  that last for an hour and match against equalized opponents as you gain rank.  And finally there's the new arena of atlantis.  This is basically a  whole new game that you can access through your character at any time.  When you click the icon at the top it lets you play against bots or players based on your ELO rating,  In this mode, absolutely nothing else matters, gear, levels, main class, all worthless here.  A level 1 can play a lvl 160 and have every chance to win.  You start picking your main characters class out of about 12 options.  You then go to a window with every single merc in the game.  First you and your opponent ban 2 away, then you each pick your final 8 with absolutely no duplicates across the board.  Skill is the only factor and you get a giant icon above your head for everyone to see.\n\nTl:DR?   Play it.","April 21, 2015","true","403.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

There has been a lot of added new update to the game after coming back 2-4 months of not playing each time. Thinking I would have quit the game, ploop~ some random awesome event comes out, which can fetch u a lot of gold, or requiring u to pay rela cash to gain 100x that gold back. Most important part of this game I like is the offers that makes you come back, even if you think you missed muched, after being long gone for awhile, they offer you a class change ticket, or a 30 day mount, or maybe a perma mount for some special event or update and many more! It offers a great damn price giving back to returned players. I do say, if you have a gambling problem, I advise not to play this game at all, but if you are moderate or don't spend at all, this game is just for you because it's all about the unique lovely battle system, not all about the gold in my opinion. Yes you may need gear and everything, but if your the type who is gone for 2-4 months and then comes back, you get tokens to rent some 30 day gear at specific levels, which is freaken OP and helps so much.

You will learn that everything from that point on requires you to pay gold to get gear, the best mercs (characters that fight with you) and the best gear. BUT! With recent updates and content being brought to Atlantica online, leveling and grinding out materials to craft gear or sell for money is easier then ever. With there being special event last the better part of a month, and a new one begining no more then a few weeks after the end of the previous one the game really is becomming more friendly to new players.\n\nAll in All Atlantica has taken up many ours of my life and i dont really regret it, the community is amazing, even though sometimes most people on the server are afk people are still helpful and open to help really anyone!

The quest structure is painfully archaic and padded out, I didn't care for the Tactical Battle System, which is basically a more sluggish version of the battle system already in place but with the added drag of moving your units. And then of course there's the nature of the microtransaction content, which is either mostly over-priced or a complete gamble.\n\nStill, I put in nearly two-hundred hours.

After contacting support who barely speak english correctly which right there tells me this is a Japanese made game and all they really care about is us fat Americans giving them our money, they refused to give me a reason why it was banned which right there is something that no company should do or be allowed to do and might not even be legal, then refused to listen to me and give me any chance at all of saving my account. This is #1 on my list of customer support nightmare stories and I honestly hope this company goes out of business and anyone involved with making this game never works again. What was done to me is the nightmare of any gamer.\n\nWhen I was allowed to play it, it was a very fun game for a long while until it just gets way too repetative. I quit playing mainly for the account thing I mentioned, but also because of a very ignorant problem that blows my mind why any game company would do something like this to their game: The games most massive flaw is that if you are, say, lvl 70 and you unlock a new teammate class and want to replace one of your lvl 70 guys in your party with him, new guys start at lvl 1 and it is nearly impossible to ever get them up to your level. That kills the fun of unlocking new party members. That and the quest system is mind bendingly tedious and quests are unbelievably long and incredibly repetative. It is an OK game if you can get past how horrible of a company this is. If you don't mind having a sudden possibility of having your account permanently locked and banned for no reason and playing a game from a company who does not have english support and if you contact them they can barely converse with you, if that doesn't bother you, have fun.","June 29, 2012","false",""," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fluffybish/recommended/212240/","fluffybish","Alessondria","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fluffybish/","87 products in account","Years ago, before I began using steam exclusively, I used to download games from their websites. I have sunk a good bit of time playing Atlantica Online. What I enjoy about the unique MMO is the original battle system. I found the crafting system pretty good too. I disliked the pay to win aspect and sometmes the grind got to me.\n\nRealiatsically I did not get very far in the game's quest or level curve. I spent no money on it and stopped at around level 100. As a casual 'play at my own pace' kinda person I thinkk I quit around level 80 or 90. Every so often I have tried to go back. Yes its dated graphics. Yes its a huge grind. Low population. Extremly greedy with item mall... its more like a expensive casino, actually.\n\nIt has its faults but I really enjoyed it. I just grew apart from it. I tried it because I generally dislike the WoW style online game and this is unique as I mentioned. Its totally worth it to check it out even today. Companies mass produce these cookie cutter copy-paste systems with different engines and art styles so if you would like to try out something new consider this.\n\nIts just a guess but I would say AO is prob not going to be around for another 5 years. But hey it might! In the past few years there have been a lot of new content added with many changes. Typically MMO type games require a massive time commitment to experience as intended. This one is that. When you are not playing you need to run the client and AFK... if you are a hardcore ♥♥♥♥♥♥mer you will prob need to keep the game running 24-7. Everyday. All day. Coming back at certain intervals to que new crafting or relist items or check on item pricing. It could be very involved. For a casual player you can enjoy it too because the combat system (even PvE) is quite enjoyable. Different.\n\nWhen I meet people who like PC gaming I often ask if they have played Atlantica. 9 times out of 10 I mention its worth a try for a week or so. But for me I am afraid my time with the game is at an end. The last time I played I went through some battles for about an hour. It was fun but not the same. There's too much new stuff to learn about. Too much of a commitment with the point in the game I got to. And there's no way in hell I am starting over.\n\nTo wrap it up: yes try it if you are a little intrested. It can be played for free. You will not play it for 3 years but its cool to experience. The game has some geat game mechanics and some wonderful progression methods. It is an eastern-style game and not too westernized, though. So you will be grinding. However the game rewards you for grinding. Even AFKing. I rate this game a 3 out of 5. Worth a look.","April 1","true","13.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Was actually a pretty great turn-based RPG. Kept playing it for about two months until the first major patch... and then it became pay to play and I immediately stopped playing. I dunno if Nexon fixed that aspect or not since then (this was in 2011 or 2010 I think I stopped playing), but if they did, it's worth a shot playing. The dungeon runs are pretty decently fun/challenging and there are a lot of party options. But yeah, since it's Nexon, it's still probably pay to win. Don't bother.","June 30, 2012","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Played this since it first came out. As many have said, it all went down with Nexon... (like most things). After level 100, the game is essentially a display of high level people showing off their expensive items. Very pay-to-win. What an unfortunate fall. However, until that point, despite the massive inflation in the game's economy, I still recommend this MMO, since it gave me YEARS of incredible play (on and off), socializing with the excellent guild and nation system, and world exploring. Massive storyline, and great quests although repetitive at times. It is a turn-based strategy combat MMORPG.","December 29, 2014","true","39.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an RPG but turned based. You choose a main chatacter class and hire up to 8 mercenaries filling in the other classes. Besides turn based, Atlantica also provides a tactical battle strategy system. It's similar to the turned base system but requires the players to move. Other than the main game, Atlantica features in crafting and guild systems that are used to even purchase main towns in the game. (Which are based off of real world maps) Individuals may also purchase houses and customize their character with fancy mounts, clothing, and wings. The gameplay become a little repetitive after a while but Atlantica is definitely a game to check out. It's free!","July 12, 2012","true","53.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you hit about level 105 the grind begins and just gets grindier as each level passes. I first started this game in august of 2010 before nexon took over from Ndoors. Nexon really didn't change much Ndoors was no better with managment.  Huge IM game you'll need IM stuff to truly progress you can ofcoarse buy most of the IM stuff via market (with in game gold) but will take alot of time back in older days it wasn't so bad you could buy atlas ore off market for 6mil a pop now 50 mil a pop that should tell you how much this game has died out. Mounts are super expensive now compared to then my current mount back in the day got it for 2bil now it's price 5.5bil-6bil.  If you a new comer with a small wallet you'd be smart to skip this old relic if you do play you'll understand why by time you reach level 110. If all you want is a time sink you found it hands down lol. Now if you rich and just looking for a money sink look no further.\n\nThe IM itself is luck based it's a gambling game no promise you'll get the item you paid $40 for from the IM so take that to heart. Personally if there is a mount or clothing item you want you got money to spend just sell atlas ore for gold then buy the item off market if it's for sale how I done it majority of the time.\nI never really spent much in this game lucky me i played mainly as free player still did very well but I had more time then money.\n\nTo tell you how much of a grind this game is I had buddy that was entirly a free player took him 2 years to get from level 110 to level 150 (was the max level at the time) and it took him 3 years get best mercs in the game up to that point. He was highly active and played daily 8-12hrs everyday.\nThat should give you nice sum of how much of a grind you'll face.\n\nAs for gameplay I love the gameplay I was more a solo type of guy a loner and I did just fine I just had use +6 armor/weapons all the time which gets pretty hard now that the game has died out alot since 2010 I still play it on n off but not like I once did harder to keep my gear +6 because way game economy is now supply of things have degraded a great deal only people providing stuff is the greedy level 160s but thats how it usually goes in any MMO when no noobs coming in you know a game isnt far from being shut down but I'd say this one will keep going long as the korean version does. So do I recommend the game sure only if you got a fat wallet or lotta time to waste. If you have neither I'd just stay away or play till 110 and quit lol.","May 30","true","29.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
