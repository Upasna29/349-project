"http://steamcommunity.com/id/icicle95/recommended/215470/","icicle95","☽Nyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/icicle95/","107 products in account","Primal Carnage is a game I can entertain myself for hours on end. Whether you're in it for the killing or just to mess around and role play (rp). I Recommend this game. It's true this game hasn't been updated in months or maybe even a year now but even so it makes a great game none the less. If you want to feel a realistic dinosaur game then this one should be on your list of games to try.\n\nThe gameplay is quite smooth if you have a decent connection to the internet, it only gets laggy if there is a player with a high ping or your internet is just slow. It's a very smooth game and this is why I prefer it over Primal Carnage Extinction. The "improved" primal carnage (Extinction) is just too choppy for me and it just doesn't have the same feel that Primal Carnage gives. When I fly as a ptera I feel free, I could spend hours just flying around a map doing tricks and going under/over hard to reach places. Bonus: Pteras can actually speed up in this game by diving, wheras in Extinction you're basically just looking to get killed if you're a ptera. The movement of the dinos feels realistic, for example the raptor pounces at what seems within logic (in game it looks to be around 15ft). The rex doesn't vacuum you up into it's mouth, you actually have to aim to eat the human. Dilos are a much harder class to play, so if you like challenges then you should play that class and try to get atleast 5 kills without dying. Another thing that I like about the gameplay is the accuracy in aiming, it seems very realistic although the bullets don't slow down, they shoot the same speed as far as you want. Even still this game is quite fun.\n\nOne huge thing I love about this game is the community. Most people I have played with are reasonable although there is arguements on kill servers about weather a person is using "aimbot" or not. All in all most people understand the rules quickly and don't usually spam. I find there is less trolling in this game then in Extinction. Generally the people you meet will want to connect with you and soon before you know it you have a new best friend or someone who is very dear to you. I highly recommend getting to know the people you play with, you'll find out that they aren't so different from you and a lot of them share common interest along with you.\n\nIn conclusion, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes an intense and fairly accurate game. If you like it from the beginning chances are you'll get hooked just like I did. I am a die hard Primal Carnage fan and I will never forget this game. So if you want a little competition try new things in this game and push yourself to see how good you can really get. Before you know it you'll be the top killer on your team. I hope some of you will consider this game and give it a try.","March 22, 2015","true","142.7"," 204 of 230 people (89%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","89","204","230","21","79"

Most were either "meh" or just bad. However, a few of them were gems; and Primal Carnage is one of them. This game succeeds what many games failed at creating: fun, cool, playable dinosaur gameplay.\n\nPlaying as the dinosaurs is in third-person and is solid, though they could use a bit more polish. Playing as the larger dinos, such as the T-Rex & Carnotaurus may seem a bit slow to respond to turning, but it doesn't deter them, or the other dinosaurs from being fun to play as a whole. Each dinosaur plays similarly, but each brings their own unique class abilities to the table.\nThe design & animation of the dinosaurs are amazing & life-like, and the DLC includes a ton of beautiful, high quality skins to use for your favorite dinosaur classes.\n\nPlaying as the humans is also surprisingly fun. The control is fluid and reminiscent of more classic forms of first-person shooters like Halo & Team Fortress 2, having no ironsights for guns other then the sniper rifle. The classes have some creative members on their team, such as the Trapper who wields net gun and dual handguns.\nThere is no form of progression system such as perks or upgrades. Though some may think the game lacking in that respect, it fits the game's simple approach to making a fun, easy to pick-up humans vs. dinosaurs multiplayer game. Though skins for the humans is still lacking compared to the number of dinosaur skins, the human DLC skins are fully remodeled and not simple reskins like as in many other games.\n\nGraphics are also top notch, rivaling many other higher budget games while at the same time not sacrificing natrual lighting and colorful environments for the filtered, cinematic atmosphere that many games today have.\n\nThe classes are fairly balanced and the gameplay relies on teamwork like in the Left 4 Dead games rather than players running off on their own and doing their own thing like in most other online multiplayer games. The game is also constently updated and is driven by community feedback via the game's website.\nThis game is definitely worth its price, especially as the game is still growing with more maps, gametypes, DLC, and more in the future.","November 25, 2013","true","423.8"," 174 of 204 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","174","204","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kevke92/recommended/215470/","Kevke92","Kevke♫","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kevke92/","251 products in account","Edit: Please consider supporting the new Early Access game Primal Carnage: Extinction. This is basically an enhanced version of Primal Carnage. Featuring upgraded graphics, more dinosaurs aswell as new customization for both dinosaurs (skins) and humans (skins & weapons). There are also new game modes.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrimal Carnage[primalcarnage.com] is a fantastic Humans VS Dinos game that either consists of Team Deathmatch or a game mode with objectives. This game doesn't get enough credit for the amazing gameplay it offers.\n\n\nThis game has unique and intense gameplay that is hard to find in games, for example:\nPlaying as the Dinosaurs feels awesome. Sprinting and stalking through the maps as a raptor makes you feel like a true rogue waiting for the perfect moment to pounce your target and rip them to death only to disappear before the rest of the humans know what happened to their valued team member.\n\n\nNot just the Raptor, but every dinosaur has unique tactics to ensure your survival.\n\nThe Dinosaurs\n- As a Dilophosaurus you'll mainly make up for your lack in strength and speed with tactics, sticking with the bigger predators     waiting for the perfect moment to spit your damaging and blinding poison at a human leaving them completely blind and defenseless.\n\n- As a Pteranodon you'll scan the ground for vulnerable prey to lift into the air and release at deadly heights, or above racing rivers.\n\n- Playing the ridiculously intimidating T-Rex or Spinosaurus mostly means offense is the best defense. You can eat humans to regain health and even trample them if they decide to get too close for your liking.\n\n- The Carnotaurus is a big brute with incredible speed and strength, sprinting headfirst into humans and smashing them in all directions with their strong attacks.\n\n\n\nHaving mentioned that, the humans are definitely no pushover in this game. They might be slower and limited in their vision due to the first-person point of view but each of their classes brings valuable tools to the fight.\n\nThe Humans\n- The trapper can lock a Raptor, Pteranodon or Dilophosaurus in a net, allowing them to come close and instantly dispatch them with their knife.\n\n- The scientist has a tranquilizer that impairs both the vision and speed of dinosaurs, allowing you (or your team) to escape a T-Rex or catch up to an escaping Raptor.\n\n- The Commando is an assault-type class that uses a grenade launcher to deal massive damage to both big and small targets.\n\n- The Trapper uses a shotgun to easily dispatch of the bigger beasts (if he can get close without being trampled) and flares to blind the Dinosaurs and force them to retreat.\n\n- The Pyromaniac uses a flamethrower to deal heavy over-time damage to dinosaurs aswell as a chainsaw to chop up a slow Dilophosaurus or an inaccurate Raptor.\n\nThe elements of surprise, teamwork and variation in classes makes this game a blast to play. This is truly the first (online) game allowing you to play a dinosaur that isn't poorly executed. Everything feels incredibly fluent.\n\n\nI highly recommend you pick up this game, it's cheap for the (guaranteed!) hours of amazing gameplay you'll have. Playing together with a friend is especially fun as you'll either be:\n\n1. Terrified, because your evil friend is in the dinosaur team following your every move.\n2. Evil, because your terrified friend is in the human team and you're following his every move.\n3. Overconfident, because nothing beats a good Raptor tag-team.. untill you come across a trapper tag-team.\n\n\nThe developers are still hard at work on implementing the newest patch[primalcarnage.com] that includes more human and dinosaur skins (including a Steam Community trading system), aswell as enhanced graphics and gameplay, overhauled maps and the whole new Horde Mode.\n\nPlease show your support for this awesome game. :)","May 22, 2014","true","32.6"," 79 of 93 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","79","93","0","0"

Something they really doesnt need.\nThere is only one map that is fair to both sides, and one that is better for human players. All the rest...dinosaur heaven.\n\nGame is alright if your only desire is to play a dino. But you will eventually get switched to the human side\nAnd what can you expect there you may say?!\n1. T-rex unkillable. Just let it eat you unless your close to a house.\n2. raptors overuse their secondary attack which is pounce. Pounce can not be escaped unless raptor is low on stamina or is damaged. You will be pounced constantly as this is the only thing raptor players ever do.\n3. Super speed grabed by the birds..yes. its ridiculous fast. Your teamates cant react in time to even try save you.\n4. Shooting these two in the face as they attack you often does not interupt their grab/pounce. Something IT SHOULD DO!\n5. Sometimes when your beeing bitten/clawed at, your reloading is interupted... Leaving you defenseless.\n6. Trapper gun sometimes shoot a phantom/ghost nett instead of the real one. Causing you to hit the fire button again to trigger reload, but instead actually shooting your real net at nothing, wasting it.\n7. Dinos will gladly sneak around health boxes. When you do it as a human to the dinos Health box you instantly get: STOP FOOD CAMPING "&"%¤!!\nHypocrites.....\n8. The Commandos granade have to hit dead on to kill a smal dino. and sometimes it does nothing at all. Even on a direct hit!\nI remember the glorious days when you just had to hit at its feet to kill it Q_Q so Glorious!\n7. all forrest like maps got health and ammo crates far from eachother! usually.\n8. So much downtime as a human. you will find yourself short of ammo constantly.\nDinos of course doesnt have this issue, as all of them have fast regenerating stamina which only is drained on running and jumping sadly(and pouncing and grabbing for raptor and bird). So really. they have no downtime to speak off.\n\nBut yes. Game can be fun if you only play as a dino, though that isent fair to the one whos forced to play a human in your place.\n\nBut in the end i cant recommend this game.\nNot in its current state.\nWhen patch 2.0 FINALY hits...then maybe.\nBut not as of now.","October 27, 2014","false","026.4"," 117 of 157 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","117","157","8","2"

It's good, stupid fun no matter which side you play on, although a questionable option to switch sides midmatch occasionally leaves too many players stacked on the dino side.Parkouring dinosaurs, sub-horror moments of Velociraptor terror, and picking up a human as a Pteranodon and dropping them to their death are just a few reasons I love the concept and execution of Primal Carnage. It's just too bad that there's not more here to flesh out the more positive qualities and suppress the negative ones from seeping through.What's there is terrific, there just needs to be more of it. Here's hoping it doesn't go extinct before it evolves into something really great.Primal Carnage could become a better beast with updates, but at launch it's missing some key elements and polish.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mataschmata/recommended/215470/","mataschmata","TRASH MAN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mataschmata/","19 products in account","Alright. I could go on, and on, and on about how AWESOME this game is. I'd been anticipating it for years after it's announcement but forgot about it. Recently I finally remembered it and I've been having fun ever since. But there's one thing I should mention before you buy the game.\n\nIt is dinosaurs vs humans, and this is the version that's no longer being updated. That means no more balancing. That said, dinosaurs are a bit overpowered. It's super fun--that is, if you get a spot on the Dinosaur team. I only know a small few of people that actually enjoy being a human, and it's always an "i'm okay with both" rather than a "i choose human over dinosaur"\n\nAlthough I've played many-a-time where the humans can win game after game after game. Really, it just depends on how good you are at first-person-shooters.\nDinosaurs are completely melee (with the exception of the dilophosaurus which can occasionally spit at humans to blind them and do a small amount of damage) and function in third-person mode. This gives you a meta advantage because you can look around structures without being seen. It adds to the "horror" feel of the game but it still puts the dinosaurs at a slight unfair advantage.\n\nDespite this, guns in the game are super strong so as long as you have a good aim you should be fine playing as a human.\n\nFor those interested but want to know more about the game, here's a short description on each class in Primal Carnage\n\nScientist: Has a sniper that can 2-shot most dinosaurs (1 hit shot if it's in the head) and a tranquilizer gun which dizzys dinosaurs and depletes stamina very quickly. press F to use the Cattle Prod that stuns and dizzys dinosaurs.\n\nCommander: equipped with a Machine gun with an alt-fire grenade launcher with grenades that have an AoE and smaller dinosaurs within the range are 1 hit KOd. press F to whip nearby dinosaurs with your gun, which does a fair amount of damage.\n\nPathfinder: Has a Shotgun that 1-shots most dinosaurs up close. Alt-fire throws a flare that on dinosaur screens looks like a bright, white light that they cannot see past. F to slash at nearby dinosaurs with a machete.\n\nPyro: Has a standard flamethrower that's hooked up to a chainsaw, which is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing cool. holding alt-fire raises your flamethrower and revs a chainsaw that obliterates nearby dinosaurs whenever they come close to you. Secondary weapon is a hand grenade that works the same as the Commander grenade launcher but is thrown rather than launched.\n\nTrapper: Main weapon is a Net Gun that holds a max of 5 nets at once and takes a little while to reload, but if it hits smaller dinosaurs such as Pteranodons, Raptors, and Dilos it will trap them and make them unable to attack or move for about 7 seconds. If you press F while facing a trapped dinosaur your knife will kill them instantly. Secondary weapon is dual pistols, one is a standard pistol that fires quickly but does little damage and has low range. the other is a Magnum that fires slowly but does a lot of damage and has high range. Both can be shot and reloaded simutaneously.\n\nNovaraptor: Very quick dinosaurs with a standard claw attack that can kill a human in 4 hits. They jump the highest of all the dinosaurs. Alt-fire allows them to pounce in which they launch forward and pin down an enemy. The pounce will use up stamina until you run out, let go, or the human is killed. While pinned a human cannot attack or move, and will stay like that unless you take damage from another human. While they are pinned, you will do damage to them until they die. Roaring empties your stamina but allows you to use your claw attack in rapid succession.\n\nDilophosaurus: Weak, Mildly fast dinosaur with a standard bite attack that can kill a human in 5 or 6 hits. These bites are poisonous and will make an enemy dizzy and recieve continuous damage for a short time. Roaring allows you to use your Alt-Fire attack twice. This attack shoots a wad of purple spit in the direction you are facing which goes through enemies and blinds whoever it hits. They cannot jump very high but can jump high enough that they can get to some higher places.\n\nCarnotaurus: Bulky, Big-target, slow dinosaur with a standard bite attack that can kill a human in 3-4 hits. Their specialty is that when sprinting, they slowly build up speed until they are running very fast and whoever they run into will recieve a heavy amount of damage and be flung. Alt-fire makes them flail which flings away any nearby enemies which is useful when you're surrounded. Roaring makes you do less damage but any damage you do will refill some of your health.\n\nPteranodon: Winged, bird-like dinosaur that can fly. Fly mechanics are decent but can be manipulated. Have a normal bite-attack they can swoop down and hit humans with--but their main attack is Alt-fire. If you swoop down and Right-click as you fly just above a human, you can grab them by their shoulders. Repeat right-click and you'll drop them. You can either fly very high up or go over water before dropping them and it will result in their death.\n\nRex: EXTREMELY op class. That's why only 1 of these is allowed for every 12 players in a game. They are very slow if not sprinting, have a hard time turning, and are a very vulnerable and big target. However, they have heeps of health and are very hard to kill. Walking over an enemy player will immediately kill them, and their main attack is a bite in whatever direction you are facing. The player you bite will promptly be grabbed and swallowed, which refills a large portion of your health. Roaring gives nearby teammates a boost, and they have no alt-fire.\n\nSpinosaurus: Available in GTC games. Same as the rex except they have an alt-fire attack that allows them to swipe at enemies below. This knocks enemies back and sometimes can do more harm than good as it gives them time to shoot.","March 14","true","129.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Well, many other Human vs Dino games have some implement that makes them special. In Dino D-Day, the Dinosaurs have guns strapped onto them. Orion Dino Horde, the Dinosaurs are always in swarms. Now, Primal Carnage is special because it doesn't HAVE anything special. It is pure, objective killing. I love the fact that it's a Red vs Blue kind of thing. The game also has some of the better graphics for Unity engine, and the sounds are amazing. The fact that this is an FPS game, or in this case, FPC ( First Person Clawer ), just blows my mind about how much work was put into it. The developers have created the new version of this game by now, but still, this game is one of my all time favorites.","December 21, 2014","true","144.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

What this permanent 1.3 may lack in balance, it heavily compensates for that in how regardless of that, it keeps me entertained for hours on end. It is easily the best shooter I've yet to play, again, both in concept as well as gameplay.\n\nOn the gameplay: It isn't the absolute best, yet it still is far better than Extinction. There for one, are actual active TDM and GTTC servers where I get decent ping! Though, certainly there are some things wrong with the game. Some of the little things I don't like, (Which I know won't change.) are: The ptera controls, no more sprint jumping to fly, and the dilo not being able to use its shorter-range spit as well as its longer-range one. I also happen to dislike how much damage the scientist does, but all of these are minor, and the game is still fun.\n\nThough this game has deviated from its original L4D style, it still had me wanting to buy it just for how interesting it seems. I can say with absolute certainty that it was worth it. I waited months and months for 2.0, an update that never came, which happened to be replaced by PC:E, a game of which i'm still trying to figure out whether or not I like.\n\nI still miss Lukewarm Media, and the consoling fact that the game was still updating and going strong.\nBut alas, I'll just have to watch this game slowly die, which may be months, years maybe. But until that time, I'll keep playing. Been a heck of a few years with this game, love it every time I play it.\n\nThanks to anyone who actually read this.","February 26","true","222.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","3"

Many balance, performance and gameplay fixes need to be made but it seems the developers have already abandoned their game with updates being few and far between.\nI would love to recommend this game because the idea of Dinos vs Humans is such a fun one but Primal Carnage executes it in a boring and sloppy manner.\n5/10 Don't even bother.","December 23, 2013","false","3.2"," 38 of 68 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","38","68","0","18"

Why it is good?\n2. Why it is Bad?\n3. Why i am confused?\nand 4. Is it worth the money?\n\nFirst of all, let me start about the pros. I believe that this is a great game because not only is it very interesting, it also has very good graphics, it can run on lower end pc's and finally can be played for hours without becoming boring. I love this game and it is probably up there in the top 3 dinosaur games ever (1.ARK:survival evolved, 2.Primal Canrage and 3.Primal Carnage: Extinction). Something i also love is the very unique depiction of a T-rex, and not just the T-rex but also the carno and all other dinosaurs. So yeah, It is a very fun game that is the best version of a "dinosaurs vs humans" game.              :)\n\nOk, so now the bad things about this game. First of all, no matter what specs you have the game is quite laggy. For me to get somewhat smooth gameplay i have to minimise my graphics even though i meet the requirements. Part of this reason is because it also relys on whether your internet is good or not (BTW yes my internet is quick. It goes 1.2mb per sec). Also because this game is old they have stopped updating this and put all focus into the second game. This means that the second game has all the newer dino versions, maps and updates (including co-op!!!). Anyway over all if your internet is quick then this may not affect you, but dont just think "i have quick internet. Ill be fine" because everyone of my friends that own they game say they receive lag.\n\nOk so now, why am i confused? Because in the trailer it shows a spinosaurus and in the dlc it talks about these new dinosaur skins for this weird dino (cryolophosaurus) but in-game there is no spinosaurus and also the dino skins they were showing for the weird dino, well you guessed it, There isnt that weird dino (cryolophosaurus) in-game. But something interestin is that they are in the second game, Primal Carnage:Extinction.\n\nSo finally, Should you buy this game? The answer is simple. No. This game is a bloody terrible game and the devs just want your money. DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY!!! hahaha I'm only joking. Of course buy this, the devs put alot of work into this game and it has become very successful so if you haven't, then please buy this game!!! IT IS AMAZING.\n\n\n7/10\n\nP.s. brofist if your pumped for Primal Carnage genesis!!!    :)  peace","July 7, 2015","true","5.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","4"

This game poops on everything appealing about that.\n\nLike many games on Steam, I got this one on sale for ~75-85% off, so I gave it a shot.\n\nLegitimately the worst balance in a multiplayer game I've ever experienced. Not even by matchmaking or server browsing or anything, but by design. Humans are extremely underpowered in almost every circumstance.\n\nThis game has a lot of DLC so that you can have skins and stuff! Normally this is something placed into a game to support developers while they continue work on their game post-release. In this case, it's just pure greed from the devs.\n\nNo tutorials or anything, awful single player options, terrible customization...\n\nThe game has been completely abandoned in favor of Primal Carnage: Extinction, with a lot of things left unfinished.\n\nOverall, this is not worth the price. It's incredibly boring and one of the least fun games I've ever played.","April 1","false","3.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","1"

The game seems like lots of fun on paper and the whole thing has been executed quite well except for one fundamental flaw (IMO), which is that the game hardly has any balance whatsoever. Humans suck. Dinosaurs rule. As a dinosaur myself, I can appreciate this, but if you are unfortunate enough to play this game as a human it's pretty much zero fun (was my experience) where the only kills you get are the ones where you are barely scraping by and meanwhile they just need to catch you.\n\nTo double up on the suck, for some reason there seems to be some issue where I can't switch teams to dinosaur. There is a switch teams option but clicking it doesn't ever seem to do anything and eventually it times out and I'm forced to respawn again (as a human). Apparently if you're patient enough you can be autobalanced to dinosaur team but I found it really frustrating seeing as I bought this game mostly to see what it's like to play as a dinosaur (which seems to be really easy to do Dino D-Day, but doesn't appear to be nearly as well done as here in Primal Carnage)\n\nThat said, I'm not saying this game is horrible, on the contrary it's very functional and I may change my opinion yet once I've clocked more than an hour in the game. but humans definitely need something for this game to be salvageable for me and I need to be able to switch teams to dinosaur every once in a while to break out of the FPS slog, that is the only reason why I wanted to play this game in the first place.\n\nNot giving up on it yet.\n\nThe dinos do look nice. <3","February 24","false","0.5"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","10","16","2","0"

Or get to the chopper here u need to capture from 3 to 2 check points wich we'll take a while tell u make it at that time u need to defined the capture point or the chopper .\n3. CTE or capture the egg . Here u need to catch an egg from the dinosaur  part of the map and it back to ur part of the map to get a human score each egg is 1point .\n\nThere are many maps for both DM and GTC  but only one map to CTE  . There are  the snowbound, marsh ,docks ,airbase,utilitybase , forest chamber  , and that is it for the DM maps .\n\nFor the GTC there are also many maps and they are , ruthless , docks , downpour, forest chamber  and that is also it for the GTC maps.\n\nAnd for the CTE there is this map called the forgotten outpost the biggest map of all maps.\n\nTo move there are w,a,s,d.

Is that not good enough for you? Well, there's more.\n\nThis game has amazing graphics for an Indie game. I'd still be impressed by them if it wasn't. (because I can easily be impressed by graphics. Even if, truthfully, they aren't great.)\nPlaying as a human can be very frustrating, however, especially when a T-rex suddenly appears and there's only 6 of you.  If that happens, then your team is probably going to lose.\n\nPlaying as a dinosaur is a different matter all together. There's something so satisfying about stalking a human, then leaping on them and tearing their face off. Yes. You heard me. Tearing their FACE off. Plus, it's hilarious to pick up a person as a Pteranodon and throwing them off a cliff. Like charging around and acting as if people are bowling pins? The Carno is for you. The T-rex can kill people by just stepping on them, and the Dilos? It's fun to blind people, let me say that much.\n\nThere are some glitches, which sometimes are benefital. I have encountered no game-breaking bugs yet.\n\nDon't hesitate. Buy this game. You won't regret it. for £11 or 15$, it's worth it.

The game progresses as any other standard team-based multiplayer game, through rounds in which 2 teams compete to have the best end score.\n\nYou can choose between a few classes of dinosaurs, each with their own unique size, speeed and strengths (raptors, t-rex, ect.) Or you can play as a human and choose between different classes of characters there as well (soldier, hunter, pyro, ect.).\n\nThe graphics are not very polished, the sound is decent though and the servers are reliable. The gameplay works and is addictive. However, since Primal Rage: Extinction released, there's barely anyone on the servers except for some experienced veterens who didn't like the changes with Primal Carnage: Extinction made to the gameplay aesthetics.\n\nAlso, consider the newer Primal Carnage: Extinction has been released, the core gameplay is basically more-or-less the same but this game seems highly outdated and the newer one seems much more playable, polished and just more enjoyable as a whole.\n\nPros  Great concept\nDinosaurs are always fun\n2 different perspectives, humans r dinosaurs\nCons  A better, more developed successor has been released\nServers are empty except for a few matches with even fewer players\nGraphics and animations are not polished\nEnvironments are underwhelming\nFinal Thoughts:\nNo disrespect to the veterens who still love and play the game - however many few that is. I, like you, do not like the roleplay games in Extinction but be that as it may, Team Deathmatch in Extinction is still much more polished and a much better quality experience.\n\nRating (5.5 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","January 17","false","1.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zerotar7878/recommended/215470/","Zerotar7878","Mattias aka TT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zerotar7878/","51 products in account","Primal Carnage is a fun online multiplayer game. The game is about humans and dinosaurs fighing each other. There are to modes so far but new things keep coming like they are going to make an campagin and adding a new game mode called horde. Anyways the 2 game modes there is right now is Deathmatch and get to the chopper. Deathmach is just a mode where you kill ontill either the dinosaurs or the humans gets 500 kills. This means the maches are going to be pretty long. The other mode (get to the chopper) is a domination tipe off thins where you capture a point and hold it for a period of time. When you have reach the goal there will come a chopper and pick you up but first you have to defend the area. The goal of the dinosaurs is to stop you at any course. This mode also fitures a spinosarus insteed of a T-rex insteed of 2000 hp it now has 4000 hp. The reason for this is probaly to make it easyer since a take down on a dinosaur is easy when the humans are stacked up and defending. There is 5 types of dinosaurs 6 if you count the spinosaurs. The 5 are T-rex, NovaRaptor, Canotarus, Peteranodon and Dilphosaurus. Each it unike apilites and play style. Novaraptor fucuses on agillity and quik attacks even so its fast its health bar is pretty low. Canotarus is a charge machine so to say all you do is charge up your speed and ram the enemy. T-rex might I add is good in almost every way you can run fast eat your orponens and walk them over. The only thing thats bad about it is the fact it turns really slow sometimes atleast. Dilphosarurus is a mix between range and meli it can shot posion that blinds the enemy for a shot while and apply a small amount off dmg for a shot time. It fucuses on blinding the enemy and then strike for a quik kill. The Peteranodon or Taradactel flys in the air and pick up people raise them up and then let them fall to there dead. It can also shout a scream that revials the enemy for a shot amond of time. The weaknes for this thing is its hard to get a kill since if you pick up a human and another human shoots you, you will drop the target instantly. There is also five tipes of humans. The each have specific roles there is Pyro, Trapper, Pathwalker, Cormandor and Scientist. The Pyro is a short range man with a flamethrower. It has a very small range but its deadly because it applys fire dmg over time. It also has a chainsaw attached to the flamethrower and it hurts like hell can even one shoot you if you aren't carefull. It has special granades that exloped almost instanly after it hits the ground. Scientist is a longe range sniper who uselly is used to take down Peteranodon or incoming Raptors. It also have a dart gun whould I call it if you hit an enemy with it then it starts to walk in a weird way because it makes them see unclear. Pathfinder is my favrite class because you have a shotgun and flares. The shotguns is exreamly good to take out Raptors and dilphosaurus. The flares does not only light up the area but also blind the enemy in the area the flare are in. The weaknes of this class is if it meets a T-rex its dead because it berly does dmg to it. Cormandor specialise in hevy weapons like machine guns and granade lunchers. This class is good to take down a T-rex because it can get fireing from a distens and enflic an anormes amound off dmg with granades. The weaknes is that its hard for it to kill a Raptor since its moving so fast. The last one the Trapper uses nets to ether cach dinosaurs for a small time or slower the bigger ones down. The Trapper also uses a pair of guns to inflec dmg on smaller dinosaurs its not that good against bigger ones like T-rex. Even though all humans have a meli attack like a knife or a eletical shocking stick or something, The Trapper is the only one who can one shot a dinosaur in the net. On to the mapps, so I am no quite sure but I believe there is around five mapps in total. Its critcal for both roles on witch map you are on because all the mapps force the player to play difrently. I believe its a good way to do that since it becomes lees boring if you played for a while. Enought of that all the mapps have a ammo case and a medical case for the humans scadered around the map. The dinos have corpses of a dead dinosaur. You can use thise things so you can keep youself alive even so if you are low on health or ran out of ammo. One thing to remmeber is that you can't do anything while you are healing or geting ammo so don't rush into it alone. The game is also good because you are constaly on the run and you gotta be on watch every second to stay alive. Its a hella good time for both pars exept if the dinosaurs are domenating because its hard to do anything against a T-rex. luckely there can only be 2-3 T-rexes debending on withs server you are playing on. There are even one map where you can avoivd a T-rex completliy because you can stay indo almost all the time. There are surten areas where T-rexes can't get in because its simply 2 big. The first time you come into the game is amazing since you can hear all thise gun shoots and dinosaurs screams. The ground is literly shacking/your screen when a T-rex are nearby to make the experiens twice as awesome. The game dosen't comes without flors like the T-rexes head sometimes gliches thow buildings and they can just eat you that way. It a stupid bug because you have no way of knowing it becuase you are already eaten. Sometimes when you are playing dinosaurs the move you are making is to fast for the screen to keep up with. Fx I didn't explain this yet the Raptor can leap forword using energi. energi deturmens how fast you can run for a shourt period of time both humans and dinos use it anyways. The Raptor can use a leap to hold you in a postioning that will kill you after sometime however you can sometimes break free either by an ally shoot the Raptor or I believe a bug or something. Nvm the leap sometimes gliches out and moves you 10 feet away form the target but you are still on him eating the ground. Overall this game is brilliant there are still somethings that needs to be fixed, and it becomes boring at sometimes so they dirently need a campaign to keep the players interested. The gameplay is fun the soundtrack is awesome and on top off that both parts are really fun to play even though humans are harder but still by my orpinion the funiest. Because you get a really go sence of satesfaction when you take down a T-rex or any other dinosaurs. So my final score for this game is a 7/10 great but could use inproment.","May 24, 2014","true","22.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetruerocka/recommended/215470/","thetruerocka","Rocka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetruerocka/","134 products in account","Primal Carnage is a game like TF2. It requires teamwork, and it's multiplayer!\n\nThere are 2 gamemodes, Team Deathmatch, and Get to the Chopper. Team Deathmatch is pretty self-explanatory, and Get to the Chopper is where the humans are trying to capture objectives to reach a helicopter, while the dinos try to stop them.\n\nEach team has five classes. The Commando has an assault rifle with a grenade launcher. His accuracy is pretty bad, so he's good against large dinos like the T-rex.\n\nThe Trapper has a net gun which can trap raptors, dilos, and pteras. He can then stab them for an insta-kill. The net can also prevent the rex and carno from biting temporarily. He also has 2 pistols to dish out damage.\n\nThe Pathfinder has a shotgun which does a lot of damage at close-range, but doesn't do well far away. It also reloads very slowly. He also has flares, which when looked at by a dino, blind them, which helps to protect capture points and repel dinos.\n\nThe Scientist is the sniper of the team. She has a sniper rifle for her primary weapon, and a tranquilzer pistol for a secondary. Her sniper rifle is very powerful, killing a raptor in about 2 shots, but shines when used against pterosaurs and rexes. Her tranquilizer darts do small amounts of damage, but reduce stamina and makes the unlucky dino's vision blurry.\n\nThe Pyro has his Flamesaw, a combination of a flamethrower and a chainsaw. The flamethrower does a moderate amount of damage, but is automatic (of course) and continually damages dinos, since they're on fire and all. His chainsaw is very strong, but drains ammo very fast and has it's own stamina bar.\n\nNow for the dinos. The Novaraptor is great at stealth, but decimates human teams when in packs. It's primary attack is to claw, and it's roar allows you to bite as fast as you click, but it drains your stamina so you can't jump or sprint. It's secondary attack is to pounce, and if you land on a human, you begin to nom their unfortunate ugly face. If you get shot by another human, however, you fall off. Pouncing also takes about a third of your stamina, so plan carefully!\n\nThe Dilophosaurus is like the Nova, as stealth and packs make it very deadly, but it is a lot less agile, and cannot pounce. However, it's bite does damage and poisons the enemy, kind of like the pyro's burn. The dilo can also spit, like in Jurassic Park, and it damages and blinds enemies. It's roar increases the range of your spit, and when you crouch, allows you to aim it better.\n\nThe Pteranodon is very unique. It can fly, and it's roar marks the location of enemies nearby you for all the other dinos to see. (It's an eye above their head.) The Ptera can also pick up humans, and drop them to their doom, whether into the sea, off of a cliff, or just from really high up. However, if you are shot while carrying a human, you will drop the human. This means it is relatively hard to pick up humans working together, so try to focus on lone ones. Oh, and you pick them up with your feet.\n\nThe Carnotaurus is like a charger in Left 4 Dead. When he runs, he can ram into humans, breaking up groups of them, and his roar reduces his damage output but makes hits give health. He can also bite and use his head like a baseball bat.\n\nFinally, the T-rex/Spinosaurus. The Rex has a ton of health, and is huge. This makes him a big target, but he can't take too much fire. His primary attack is to bite, and you can move his head up and down with set buttons. If he eats a human, he gets some health back, but eating takes a few seconds. If Rexy picks up a lot of speed, he can trample humans as well. His roar gives nearby dinos an adrenaline boost, increasing their health for a bit. The Spinosaurus can only be used in Get To The Chopper. He has more health then the rex, and can smack humans away with his arms, but it takes longer for him to eat his prey.\n\nWell, that's Primal Carnage. There's also free DLC and skin packs, if you're interested in that. Thanks for reading!","April 20, 2013","true","44.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You have a choice of 4 classes. The dinos have a choice of Spinosaurus, Pterandon, Ovaraptor, Trex, Carnotarus, and dilophosaurus. Human Team has the choice of Paleontologist known as the scientist with the weapon of a sniper rifle and tranquilizer darts, Commando who carriws an assault rifle armed with 3 or 4 grenades, Pathfinder who has flares that blind dinos with a powerful shotgun, Trapper that carries dual wield pistols and is able to trap dinos in a net and also had a melee that most netted dinos die instantly, and the pyromaniac/pryo that has a powerful weapen of a flame saw that is a combination of a chainsaw-flamethrower hybrid also able to chuck grenades at enemies.  Although they could add some bug fixes and other things since there are many glitches such as the rex getting caught in places not alowing them to get out, just minor fix with lagging, and I was able to get past the lines/ border  in capture the egg/ FGOP (<--- i think). Overall the team has done a wonderful job making this game with a combination of dinos and humans. Hopefully they will create some skins for the spino and for people to be able to buy the feathered raptor skin on steam. I really recomend buying this game. You will get frusteraded if you get killed a lot but its worth playing!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greenapples/recommended/215470/","greenapples","Green Apple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greenapples/","35 products in account","Primal Carnage is a fairly simple game: you play as either a dinosaur or a human, and the goal is simply to be on the winning team. Each round can be around 20-30 minutes, and you have to use your skills in order to kill as many enemies as possible. It can be quite fast paced and sometimes stressful, but always fun regardless whether you play as a dinosaur or human.\nIt's often on sale, and I'd recommend buying it then. The game is good for killing an hour or so of your time, but there really isn't anything more to Primal Carnage other than maiming your opponents and the amount of maps is fairly small, so perhaps it's not a game one should pay full price for (there isn't a lot of content).\n\nBe aware that there often is a significant amount of lag regardless of your ping, and that does take away from the fun. But the lag isn't always there and it's sufferable. Anecdote:  One time I managed to lag severely while launching a jump attack as a Raptor, and somehow went flying across the entire map and into a cliff, where I died from the impact. Was going for a new personal record too, so that was a bit irritating... : P\n\nAll in all, I do recommend this game for people who enjoy dinosaur games and/or first person shooters.","November 14, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Be a raptor & pounce on people. Be a T-rex & run them over or swallow them whole. Fly around as a Pteradon. Be a spitter. Be a compy (the small little guy).\nI could end the review there, but I won't.\n---\n\nStory: what story? It's multiplayer only\n\nGameplay: It's a First-person shooter if you're on human side, and\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>a 3rd person action game if you're on Dinosaur side\n\nTeam balance: auto-balanced teams, so the worst it will ever be is 1 man advantage. (although sometimes it takes like 2-3 minutes for the auto-balance to force someone to switch teams)\n\nBalance balance: Classes seems fair enough* for me. (I won't go through each class, but) Each class is unique.\nAs humans you do have to use a little more team-work, but then again, that's part of what makes the game thrilling -that you almost HAVE to work together to survive\n\nModes: Team Deathmatch, Get to the Chopper (my favorite), and Capture the egg(?) (the last mode they added, kind of like king of the hill mixed with capture the flag -which I admit I haven't seen actually played)\n\nTL;DR= the game is fun.\nSure, it doesn't have a progression system & it doesn't keep track of any stats, but it's an adrenaline rush of a game that promotes teamwork, and to this day I have yet to find a better game for FEELING LIKE A RAPTOR. :D\n\n(Oh, and it has steam achievements, so there's that, too)\n\n-------\n*some people say the Pyro's flamethrower and fire-bomb are both OP,  That may have some truth to it, but I think you need to have a class like that to deal with hordes of dinos in the same place. there are ways the dinos COULD deal with a pyro, so I don't see that big of a problem with him.","December 27, 2015","true","45.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was playing with a trackpad, and while it could have been more fun with a functioning mouse of some kind, I definitely enjoyed killing things. How it works is that you're put onto the Human team or the Dinosaur team. On each team you can select a character--A type of hunter, or type of Dinosaur respectively. They have different maps and that's neat, but actually, it's not neat. Some of them are terrible to be a Dinosaur on and have Human advantage (but the opposite is also true).\n\nMy favorite thing to be was a raptor, because who doesn't love jumping onto unsuspecting Humans and tearing them apart? I wasn't great at finding health to recover with, which would have also improved my game play/reduced my time spent dead, but I enjoyed it none-the-less. It's most fun to play with people you know, though I think there's a policy against group chat (I was chatting with friends the entire time, but it was less about giving off location and more about calling people chumplords and hearing their groans when you kill them).\n\nEither way, this was really fun and if you're considering getting it, then you probably should. 8/10, would recommend.","April 14, 2015","true","2.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

This game is well polished, the dinosaurs are made perfect with their moments & humans too putting graphics to its extent. Maps are made with prehistoric ideas which is really cool. 5 Classes of dinosaurs, (You can be T-Rex too) with Spinosaurus in GTC mod vs. 5 Classes of balanced well humans fight for their survival as team. Team work is really necessary here. Each & every map in this game has so much of detail and made without any fault. It was good that this game was multiplayer only because now we can’t judge what will happen next when we are humans or dinosaur because there are no pre-defined actions for dinosaur & humans. So it’s like in this game we are the AI to control dinosaur & humans. Humans are better than AI. Wait for Primal carnage genesis for single player actions...

This game outright convinced me to get Steam, alongside Skyrim,  and to buy the sequel (which is arguably worse.)\n\nPros:\n-Teams switch every round so everyone gets a chance to play dinosaur (most times)\n-The 2 gamemodes available are quite fun and challenging: a Team Deathmatch mode and an objective based mode called "Get to the Chopper"\n-Quite a few species of dinosaur, including Dilophosaurus, Spinosaurus, T.rex and a hybrid raptor called "Novaraptor"\n-The human classes are both fun and challenging, and all have a personality. From the calm English sniper, the gung-ho   US commando, the Aussie trapper and the insane Scottish pyromaniac,\n\nCons:\n-The game, in terms of development, is very, VERY dead. LukeWarm Media were bankrupted and they split up, forming several different companies. One of these, Circle 5, is developing the sequel, Primal Carnage Extinction.\n-Some attacks feel overpowered, and as the game's not being updated, these will never be fixed.\n-Graphics can feel exceptionally mediocre on anything but "High" settings\n-As a result of the sequel, the game's not very populated.\n\nOverall, a brilliant multiplayer experience - if you can find a match.","October 30, 2015","true","91.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

I'm by no means a die hard fan of them, but certain titles I do love such as the Battlefield series.\n\nI was looking for a game that set itself apart from other shooters. And that ladies and gentlemen, is just what Primal Carnage does.\n\nDoes the game have a plot or storyline? Nope. How about any singleplayer action? Not at all. No, it's entirely online PvP based. Even so, I still really like Primal Carnage. Do you want to know why? I'll tell you why. Dinosaurs! THAT'S WHY!\n\nUpon changing your video settings and joining a server that tickles your fancy, you'll have to join either the humans or dinosaurs. Both teams have five classes, except in the "Get to the Chopper" game mode, where the dinosaurs have the option to be a different dinosaur. All classes for both sides have their strengths and weaknesses which is good to see and balances out the game nicely.\n\nAside from "Team Deathmatch" there's also Get to The Chopper" which I mentioned earlier. This game mode is objective based, with humans aiming to ultimately escape. I personally haven't played this gamemode very much, I prefer standard deathmatch as it's simple and really fun.\n\nEach human has their ups and downs, but most of the time I find myself playing as a commando because of the simplicity of the gun a grenade launcher. Other classes include a Trapper, Scientist (sniper), Pyro (flamethrower) and a Pathfinder (kind of a maverick.)\n\nPlaying as each different dinosaur feels really different too. Some are small (novaraptor, dilophosaurus), some are bigger (carnotaurus and a T-Rex!) and there's even one that flies (pteranodon)!\n\nSo overall, Primal Carnage has great variety and is absolutely some great fun to play. It's also relatively inexpensive on Steam (and Origin, if you swing that way.) A real gem.\n\nIt gets 9/10 from me.\n\n","December 10, 2013","true","13.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Lukewarm Media's debut comes out of the gates screeching, roaring, and grenade launching as you fight as either an assorted team of humans or an equally varied team of dinosaurs against the opposite team.\n\nForget the other dinosaur games that came and went -- this is definitely one to have.\n\nEach class, whether human or dinosaur, has its own unique set of skills, abilities, and weaknesses. The Raptor, for example, is your token stealth class -- he's not got a lot of armor or bulk, but he's fast, can pounce in an instant, and leap higher than every other dinosaur. The Commando class, for the humans, is your token heavy class. He's got an assault rifle with a grenade launcher and can melee kill trapped and injured dinosaurs with ease, but with his big gun comes a lot of recoil and relatively low stamina.\n\nIt's really worth the asking price, and for such a low amount it really can't be beat.

This is probably the best dinosaur game I've played in a while despite it being only a team deathmatch genre game, it does one thing a lot of people want to do and what other dinosaur games have failed to do well, play as dinosaurs! The dinosaurs are very well designed and in my personal opnion the mechanics of them are quite good aswell, from the detail right down to the animations and sounds! There are five classes on each team for the dinosaur there are,  Pterandon, Novaraptor, Dilophosaurus, Carnotaurus, Tyrannosaurus rex and Spinosaurus (the spinosaurus is only available for get to the chopper and not team death match!)\n\nThe human team rely on weapons but also have other useful tactical weapons, the pathfinder class have flares and these appear blinding to the dinosaurs thus getting you out of a near death situation, There are five classes all together on the human team, Commando, Pathfinder, Pyro, Scientist and the Trapper each having their advantages and disadvantges.\n\nPrimal Carnage's environments favour for both dinosaurs and humans, I've found myself playing as both and I've found that I could adapt with both teams with each map (except Marsh more tricky and does favour dinosaurs a bit more!)\nThere are a total of six maps, Utility base, Airbase, Docks, The Falls, Forest Chasm and Marsh. each having a different environment setting.\n\nThis game is very captivating and a lot of fun can be had with this game and I defiantly recommend this game to others!\n\nMy final verdict is a solid 8/10 would of been a 9 but the game does have some issues with lagging and other optimization issues but the devs are working on a update to fix all of these issues!\n\n","May 9, 2014","true","44.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First of all, its genius that someone thought of a survivor vs dinosaur multiplayer FPS and both the concept and design work very well for what it is. The game does have some hiccups and misfires in certain areas but you have to give it credit for getting some things right, lets go over the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n> Impressive enviromental and dinosaur graphics\n> Brilliant Concept\n> Can be very fun in small doses\n> DLC isnt required to have fun with the game and is mostly cosmetic\n\nCons:\n> Hardly anyone plays it and when they do, the pings are terrible for US players\n> Server browser issues (servers dont always show)\n> Can have serious balance issues\n> Too many map design flaws that either make the game too easy, or too difficult\n> The human character designs and animations seem off somehow\n\nIn the end, the price is about right for what you get and you do get enough to keep you busy for a little while provided you find a server with decent ping, or at all. If you have some extra cash to spare it might be worth your time especially if youre an avid fan of Jurassic Park, where the game gets much of its inspiration from. But if youre looking for a more populated, balanced multiplayer experience you might want to look elsewhere. 6/10","December 31, 2013","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It looks great, and if the default skins aren't cutting it, theres a number of DLC skin packs available, including premium skins which are new models/species (with same game play as original, hence premium skin and not new class). Even if there are some noteable scietific innacuracies, its a game, not a documentary, so I have no issue with any of the dinosaurs designs. The inclusion of some slightly more obscure species (namely tupandactylus and cryolophosaurus) that have only rarely made appearances in video games/pop culture, is certainly a nice touch.\n\nIt runs reasonably well, of course its been between updates for some months now, this next update promises a complete recode, with far better system optimisation to help it run a bit better. In the meantime it can get pretty laggy at times, and there are a handful of glitches and strange controls that are still in process of being fixed.\n\nWith the rising numbers of dinosaur featuring FPS/TPS games coming out Primal Carnage is leading the pack by a mile, (I would place it a notch above DinoDDay, and for goodness sake its better than Orion Dino Horde).","November 30, 2012","true","480.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is probably the best dinosaur game I've played in a while despite it being only a team deathmatch genre game, it does one thing a lot of people want to do and what other dinosaur games have failed to do well, play as dinosaurs! The dinosaurs are very well designed and in my personal opnion the mechanics of them are quite good aswell, from the detail right down to the animations and sounds! There are five classes on each team for the dinosaur there are,  Pterandon, Novaraptor, Dilophosaurus, Carnotaurus, Tyrannosaurus rex and Spinosaurus (the spinosaurus is only available for get to the chopper and not team death match!)\n\nThe human team rely on weapons but also have other useful tactical weapons, the pathfinder class have flares and these appear blinding to the dinosaurs thus getting you out of a near death situation, There are five classes all together on the human team, Commando, Pathfinder, Pyro, Scientist and the Trapper each having their advantages and disadvantges.\n\nPrimal Carnage's environments favour for both dinosaurs and humans, I've found myself playing as both and I've found that I could adapt with both teams with each map (except Marsh more tricky and does favour dinosaurs a bit more!)\nThere are a total of six maps, Utility base, Airbase, Docks, The Falls, Forest Chasm and Marsh. each having a different environment setting.\n\nThis game is very captivating and a lot of fun can be had with this game and I defiantly recommend this game to others!\n\nMy final verdict is a solid 8/10 would of been a 9 but the game does have some issues with lagging and other optimization issues but the devs are working on a update to fix all of these issues!\n\n","May 9, 2014","true","44.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nazenn/recommended/215470/","Nazenn","Nazenn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nazenn/","48 products in account","Spent quite a few hours in the game recently and thought Id post my thoughts on the current version (1.3)\nWhile yes it does have issues that are likely to frustrate many players, the overall game and the challenge of it more then make up for those frustrations for me and it is incredibly fun to play and even just to explore all the mechanics of it.\nThe core issue in the game itself is its balencing. The balencing is unequal between the dinos and humans, and goes against what you would expect. Classes that should do high damage dont, classes that should have low defense have strong, and similar issues along those lines. There are a lot of tricks to get around these problems that you will quickly learn by playing the game on various maps and learning techniques you can use to help overcome the bad balencing.\nOtherwise, technically the game runs very well, there are a few of the usual Unreal Engine errors, but certainly nothing game breaking or enjoyment stopping. The game feels VERY smooth to control, and I don't get any motion sickness like I usually do with FPS games, although it is worth noting that setting up a controller is incredibly difficult and not doable from just in game.\nSo yes while it does have a few issues I find the game itself incredibly enjoyable. The satisfaction of taking out a Rex, or dealing with a bouncy raptor is great, the same as you get as a dino when you manage to sneak up on a human and kill them or set up a run to do mass damage to a group at once. Turning around and seeing a dino charging at you is terrifying, helped by the great sense of scale that the devs have used model wise, and being killed across the map by a human with great aim really keeps you on your toes as a dino.\nWhile its not the most spectaular looking game, the graphics and assets they have used work very well together. Flora moves when you touch it, which means keeping your eyes open is very helpful, and the maps are well spaced, and often have unique balencing across various areas of the map itself. There is also a nice variety of map styles that you can play, if you can find servers using them.\nI do highly recommend the game, and it is great deal of fun, although if the balencing is likely to extremely frustrate you, you might be better off waiting for the v2.0 thats being worked on.","October 23, 2014","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My only problem is that the balancing is terrrible. The dinosaurs were too OP so they made guns do more damage. This in turn made the humans OP so they made the guns wildy inaccurate and called it good.\n\nAs it stands humans will die in small groups or alone as the dinosaurs greater health, and speed are a great boon, but are impossible to defeate in large groups due to the Wall O' Bullets effect. In this way the game becomes incredibly one sided depending on the extent to which the players of each team know of the games flaws.","June 27, 2013","false","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Primal Carnage is a team-based PvP game with, you guessed it, Dinos and Humans. The only plot is that there's an island where Dinosaurs have been reborn (Jurassic Park gone wrong?) and humans get trapped on the island. The classes are pretty basic, each one has a main and secondary attack, along with Dinos getting a roar ability which buffs other Dinos. The concept of gigantic Tyranosaurs and Spinosaurs isn't as overpowered as you might think, and they pulled it off pretty well, although obviously if you got someone good playing he'll probably wreck your team.\n\nThere isn't a big community left, mind you, but it isn't hard finding a full server if you want to play a couple rounds of Dino smashing or Human stompin'. It's worth the $8, but if you can pick it up on a sale go for it. It's freakin' Primal Carnage.","November 30, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As long as humans and dinos stick together in teams, the game can be challengingly fun. It also takes quite a bit of time to master some of the dinos, so you can't just go charging into a group of humans thinking you're invincible.\n\nI do criticize the inability to aim down the sights on some of the human weapons (e.g. Commando's machine gun).

If you are a player, I would say if you can cope with a few glitches, obligatory childish players with the majority being mature adults, good graphics and decent gameplay, then this game may be for you!\n\nBut as I've stated before, this message is more for the devs at Lukewarm Media. You guys need to MAKE AN EXPANSIVE, FREE ROAM, CUSTOMIZABLE DINOSAUR SIMULATOR! Honestly, if I wanted to play a Humans V.S. Something else, I'd play Left 4 Dead or something along those lines. But the dinosaur models are fantastic, and with a few alterations, they could be the best I've seen!\n\nThere are virtually no Dinosaur Simulators, and for good reason. People can't seem to make them correctly. However, if you keep the models and the sound (and for the love of God, work on the textures and environments), then I'd say you guys at Lukewarm are on the fast-track to a pretty awesome game! These are just ideas, of course, and the idea of a superb Dinosaur Simulator is my own ambition, not yours. So these are just suggestions for you guys!

Some would say it is a terrible game, there is little variety in the human classes and the weapons are uninspired, boring and lack impact. Many of the maps are confusing, clutters of bushes and rocks, lacking any personality or landmarks, making navigation almost impossible. There are barely any servers and the netcode is horrible, making everything delayed due to this awkward lag. The launcher of the game will even sometimes crash and the menus might glitch out sometimes preventing you from joining any games. The community is silent and you barely find anyone talking anywhere, well I should say typing, since the game doesn't have voice chat. However you can communicate with other people with 2 whopping sound clips that make the voice commands in CS:GO and TF2 pale in comparison. The balancing is severely off as well, the dinosaurs being way overpowered compared to humans.\n\nHowever, the game is riddled with all sorts of problems, sometimes, during a full moon when the stars align, you will not even notice all of this, because you will be having such a great time. playing as the OP dinosaurs is a blast, ramming people as a carno, pouncing as a raptor or eating everyone in your way as a T-rex never gets old. When you do get to be in one of these rare games where everything is just sunshine and lollipops, you realize this game has real potential, but it is just buried under so much filth and just needs polishing to uncover these great bits.

There's something satisfying about knocking a mercenary off of a cliff or flying them up into the sky and dropping them like dead weight.\n\nThe mercenaries also have their own combat tools and NEED to work together to win. The biggest gripe I have is the vastly unfair pressence of a T-Rex on the dino team. Every time I see an Enemy T-Rex play they always seem to somehow have 80 kills with no deaths and to be frank they are a huge distraction to the other dinosaurs to the point where focusing attention is difficulty. I won't lie, I spent more time watching my various characters get eaten by T-Rexes (even when I hide inside) than I did actually shooting dinos. That aside, the game is simple to play, easy to get into, and fun to play on either side (There's also that satisfying feeling when you trap a raptor about to eat your face giblets and then you knife it to death)\n\nThis game should be renamed to: "The Magic School Bus: The T-Rex Digestive System"","December 26, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

You guys need to MAKE AN EXPANSIVE, FREE ROAM, CUSTOMIZABLE DINOSAUR SIMULATOR! Honestly, if I wanted to play a Humans V.S. Something else, I'd play Left 4 Dead or something along those lines. But the dinosaur models are fantastic, and with a few alterations, they could be the best I've seen!\n\nThere are virtually no Dinosaur Simulators, and for good reason. People can't seem to make them correctly. However, if you keep the models and the sound (and for the love of God, work on the textures and environments), then I'd say you guys at Lukewarm are on the fast-track to a pretty awesome game!

Some would say it is a terrible game, there is little variety in the human classes and the weapons are uninspired, boring and lack impact. Many of the maps are confusing, clutters of bushes and rocks, lacking any personality or landmarks, making navigation almost impossible. There are barely any servers and the netcode is horrible, making everything delayed due to this awkward lag. The launcher of the game will even sometimes crash and the menus might glitch out sometimes preventing you from joining any games. The community is silent and you barely find anyone talking anywhere, well I should say typing, since the game doesn't have voice chat. However you can communicate with other people with 2 whopping sound clips that make the voice commands in CS:GO and TF2 pale in comparison. The balancing is severely off as well, the dinosaurs being way overpowered compared to humans.\n\nHowever, the game is riddled with all sorts of problems, sometimes, during a full moon when the stars align, you will not even notice all of this, because you will be having such a great time. playing as the OP dinosaurs is a blast, ramming people as a carno, pouncing as a raptor or eating everyone in your way as a T-rex never gets old.

When you're a human, you can easily be overwhelmed by one or two raptors that circle around you. It basically has a massive skill curve for the Human side, but for the Dinosaurs, it all feels right.\n\nGraphics: I play on medium, but it's still very nice looking. It is an Unreal Engine game so it is "shiny".\n\nStability: Not the best for stability. There could be a lot of moments where your FPS drops down in a spike, especially during a fight. Not too bad, though, atleast for the Dinosaur side.\n\nGameplay: Dinosaurs are really fun, Humans could totally use some rebalancements.\n\nCommunity/Playerbase: Nobody seems to be mean at all, but the playerbase is really small for this game. I found a hard time looking for a server with a good amount of players.\n\nTL;DR: For 15$, it's a little expensive. But not too expensive, for how the game is. Nice on the Dinosaur side, kinda uncomfortable on the Humans side. Low playerbase. Good graphics but not too stable. Buy at your own risk.","May 22, 2014","true","2.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","4"

So perhaps my review is a bit bias?? Mayhaps? Welp, I'm not instantly in love with every dino related thing that comes out. There is a lot that can go wrong. so some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n1) The dinosaurs have skills and powers that fit with what it is. The animation of these is terrific. I'v been charged at when I was a human and punted around. It feels smooth and not wonky and awkward so when your a raptor pouncing on someone there isn't this a awkward glitchy *waiting for animation to line up* thing that you might get from other games. Which makes it feel more epic and fluid. Also, they don't needlessly have guns attached like in other titles since well lets face it they are pretty badass without them.\n\n2) Yeh I like dinosaurs, and I like playing as the dinosaurs but I legitmentally enjoyed playing both sides. I was concerned that I'd be upset at playing the humans because I'd be waiting to switch sides. Not the case at all. It was really thrilling to be running around, hiding and hunting and really fun to try to kill these beasts. The balence is really great and far too often games like this would tip the scale to make the humans stronger to stand a chance but no everything feels accurate.\n\n3) This is sort of a mix of TF2/CSGO/Jurassic Park, I found out about this when I was playing CSGO and had an idea of, 'wouldn't it be great if like the entire Terrorist Side was replaced by Raptors?' And to my delight someone says 'that exists'! If you want to, join or host a server with your friends. Play as all raptors if you wanted.\n\n4) NOMNOMNOM! Pouncing, teamwork and straight up clever girl moments. I <3 it.\n\nCons:\n\n1) I'v only played about an hour so far but had trouble figureing out some of the controls. My poor little Pteranodon floundered around like a wounded bird for a little while, honestly I expected it to glide. It was still fun, but yeh spend a little bit of time to play with the controls before you judge it. I have a feeling some people just didn't bother to learn before they reviewed. They aren't difficult honestly, just don't expect any tutorials. Also, I'v seen people do things that I can't figure out how to do. Not sure if it is controls related or dlcs.\n\n2) uuuuh... Maybe more dinos? This isn't a con really, there are only 5 but I think a lot can be done and who knows maybe it can but I haven't explored that far. But yeh like host a server and change up what type of dinos are allowed of a like pick 5 from a list of 20. Or even limit it to 1 type. Who knows, maybe future updates but either way awesome the way it is.\n\n3) Would be nice if you could earn skins or gear from in game. Like earn points per kill or even a drop system like csgo. I'm not a huge fan of buying dlc's for that, but I don't feel it is pay to win or anything so I'm putting it as a minor offence.\n\n4) Would love the option to first person as the dinos. 3rd person is nice and all for the epic jumps and animation but still would like to toggle between the two options. Heck they could even use it to nerf a trex by giving it motion based vision.\n\nI'v glanced at some other reviews and not sure why people would not recommend this. So take those with a grain of salt. It's pretty clear about what it is on the tin, so if you aren't into that then well move on.","December 18, 2014","true","3.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

For one, this game has brought so many little thunder-♥♥♥♥♥ into the dinosaur community, it's not even ♥♥♥♥ing funny. This game is basically Left 4 Dead 2, but with dinosaurs. Here's an example of those thunder-♥♥♥♥♥. "LUL DILOSAURUS IN RELE LIF AR SO SMALL, END IT SPITS TOO!!! 1 1 1 11 xDDD xxDDDDDDDDDD WE WIL ROILPLEY MATEING IN A SURVIR!!"\nI've been into so many sexual servers, that I lost count after 21. The roleplaying in this has got out of hand. Now we have trappers acting like little kids, saying the scientist is the mom. How ♥♥♥♥ing childish is that? We have people from 7-12 years old in this game, acting like complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. All they do is spam attacks.\nThe changes in this game are so unbearable, that I don't play this game anymore. Dilophosaurus was changed when some gerber-baby-potato-autist said that 201 was odd, and now Dilophosaur's health is lower. They listen to that ♥♥♥♥, but don't listen to the normal players.\nI'll give this game a 5/10.

Most of the players are fun people to team up with. There are plenty of servers to choose from and it gives you the option to host or sort through the lists to find one you'd be interested in. Most keep it short so if you get tired of playing as a human there is usually a timer in the top right letting you know when the switch will be made. There are of course some users who hate playing as a human and will ditch the game as soon as they're human only to force the game to autobalance the teams... which means even if you played the full time as a human and you finally got to be a dino there is a chance you could be autobalanced back into being a human. It's sad, but I've gotten used to it since the game is still pretty fast paced and you can take a lot of joy out of just acting silly as you strive for the high score. Or you could just play around the entire time while avoiding getting killed. There are a few RP servers where they are a No-Kill server but the game really isn't set up for such a thing so it makes a great location to practice how to jump to that ledge you've always wanted to get to or learn how to fly with the Ptero... or figure out just how far you can spit as a dilo. :D","September 14, 2014","true","115.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's a few balance kinks (Namely: One map requires humans to move through a narrow chokepoint, and 1 dinosaur player can spawn as a huge T-Rex that 1-hit kills, is as large as the chokepoint, and cannot be killed by the humans. Problem?). This game has a cool premise, and a lot of different game modes and classes for both sides, and with balancing it could be great. Except that the gameplay itself really isn't that fun yet. You run around and hipfire in the unreal engine as a human, and you run around and use a crosshair to aim melee attacks as a dinosaur.

It was a really fun co-operative game and even the dinos co-operated :D I loved being the Pteranodon personally, keeping a hawk-eye view on those pesky little humans who liked to hide in awkward places!\n\nAnyways, I have got the sequel game that was once an update, and I enjoy it. I breathes new detailed life into the somewhatlower poly, even if only by a little, old models we had. I don't see any of DLC bought being transferred over but maybe that's a feature to come. I did get the " Classic Novaraptor" which is that weird green booger colour of the default back in PC that made me feel uncomfortable staring at the butt of while trying to pounce on people.\n\nNow, Primal Carnage is not a bad game now, even if there appears to be a basic reboot that looms overhead like a shelf cloud about to burst some sick lightning on PC's ♥♥♥, it's still just silly fun about hunting people or hunting dinosaurs. No doubt it'll either have only a couple dedicated servers in the end with a lot of modded ones, or just all modded self-hosted servers.\n\nSo, amigos. Grab a gun, holster your secondary weapon and let's go kill us some dinosaurs! Dinos! Sharpen your claws, stretch your wings and bare your teeth as we hunt down some humans! I don't care if we're fighting for the Extinction of one or the other, or merely fighting for the fun of the Carnage! I just care that I get to have a sniper rifle in one hand, and some good teammates on my back. Or in the dino's case, I'd be glad to have some eyes in the skies and a big bad T-rex acting as my meat shield and scattering the humans like roaches.","December 23, 2014","true","130.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Such as gravity accelerating your fall or dive as a Ptera.\n\nThe original game isn't the best balanced either though.... It's just fun to play!

A good team can make your enemies scream in rage, and a bad team will lose the match for you, so it is very dependent on good players; however, the way the game is built (horrendously overpowered dinos - a good thing, mind you -, scattered spawn points, and just a lonely time on your own) mean that a team will naturally come together, and few things are more satisfying than the mighty, fearsome, invincible tyrannosaurus stomping on screen, only to be turned into a glorified roast turkey by a hail of bullets and flame. The two game modes, Deathmatch and Get to the Chopper, usually play out very quickly and easily. This is bad and good; it is an incredibly easy game to just jump into, but it's no Battlefield 4 tactically speaking. If you just want to shoot some dinos (or eat some humans) while having wicked, mindless fun, this game is definitely worth the buy.","December 4, 2013","true","115.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegriz617/recommended/215470/","thegriz617","Thegriz617","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegriz617/","208 products in account","Let me tell you a story about growing up in the 90s. The thing now a days is zombies, zombies everywhere from the the slow lumbering corpses as seen in Romero's "of the Dead" series to kirkmans the walking dead, to the new and fast infected of franchises like left 4 dead and 28 days later; but in the 90s everything was about dinosaurs, classics like Stephen speilburgh's Jurassic park,  to Jim Henson dinosaurs,  every kid wanted one, every kid had thousands of their toys, and every kid screamed for more.\n\nNow that being said, there weren't any guides, or codes, or even rules to make a good dinosaur game. Sure we had a few classics like snes's Jurassic park, but those were well before my time, with my first console being the PSX. Now i'm glad to see that there is a few people with that mindset and these people grew into a game company called lukewarm, and they've made the best dinosaur game in history, ever, buy it. What are you waiting for click the buy button.  Fine, you wanna know why it's good? well here,\n\nIf you've ever played with your gi joes and army men then made them fight dinosaurs, this makes that fantasy come true. In the game you can either play the action figure looking humans or the or the nicely monstrous looking dinosaurs.  On the human side you can pick five classes a la team fortress 2 a nimble female sniper, an action hero looking heavy, an Irish pyro, and a hunter that looks nothing like bob peck (the guy that gets eaten by a velociraptor right after saying "clever girl") from Jurassic park.  Each of these classes have unique game play with the gunner's heavy machine gun, pyros chainsaw flame-thrower, and snipers sniper that makes the game as a whole, totally worth the buy.\n\nNow to move on the the other end of the scale there are the dinosaurs that are a totally different brand of game play than the first person shooter style of the humans. The dinosaurs have more of a third person action aesthetic that gives their brand more of a left 4 deadish style glee hearing the scream of someone on the mic as i gnaw their face off as a velociraptor.  each dinosaur like a human, has a very distinct and abject set of traits that make each of them more unique class game-play. Like left 4 dead I've often found myself, and my co-horts in dinosaur related terror striking in precision letting the charger like carnosaur go in first, knock everyone on the ground to let the smaller velociraptors come in and pounce like hunters onto the straggling survivors of the attack.\n\nOne of the things I've found shocking about this game is the graphics. Not the aesthetics, though we will get into that later, the sheer work that is put into this engine  the trees move, the winds whirl, the storms storm, the snoz berries snoz berry and everything just catches my eye. Now a lot of people who are used to big budget games will argue that this is no crisis and that they might spend their time elsewhere but for an indie game with their first release? HOLY ♥♥♥♥ this is amazing. i love this company and what they've done with this game is nothing short of breath taking.\n\nAnother thing that I've found that bodes in this game's favor is its absolute beauty and great looking art style. The lush tropic greens are a much desired break from the tedious browns and war torn look of most games. A lot of the maps are cluttered in a neat way that makes for interesting paths and unique always for a raptor to find it's prey and to strike from any direction they choose. See, the clutter here is good unlike modern military shooters  because the clutter serves a function and has a means to an end. The unique shrubbery and tropical jungle gives even t-rexes a chance to pop out 3 feet in front of your face only giving you enough time to scream in horror before you're lunch\n\nAll in all, great graphics, great game play, great art style. Buy it, it's more than worth your money\n\n","December 8, 2013","true","23.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Unfortunately the install always fails if you have a newer version of the framework (like 4.5) This causes your system to force restart in a minute.  And when windows boots back up, you're greeted with a message... That installation failed again and that your computer is going to reboot in a minute....\n\nTo avoid the loop don't click the close button on the error message.  Instead hit Ctrl+Shift+Esc to quickly pull up Task Manager.  under the processes tab find 'Setup.exe' and click on that and then the end process button at the bottom of the window.   Sure you wont be able to play the game because of the failed non-installation of Framework, but now you won't need to go crazy trying to fix your computer either.\n\nStrangely enough if you boot the game directly from your steam folder you avoid this nonsense altogethor and can hop in the game.","February 28, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"Unlike any you've previously experienced" is reasonably accurate. And I don't want to experience anything like it in a game again.\n\n- It looks and feels like a halflife mod. The default graphical settings look nothing like what you see in the preview above.\n- Tutorial really is needed. Especially for the flying dino to get a handle on the picking up mechanics and how to use the first aid/ammo kits (so many people jumping on top of them not knowing there's a use button)\n- No quickplay option\n- If the game is over the cap for number of T-Rexs it spawn you then says you can't be there and makes you wait an extra 5 seconds instead of something sensible like disabilng the button on the selection screen.\n- Single shot guns like the net and grenade launcher really should reload automatically instead of having to fire again.\n- Inconsistent binding between characters. One has grenades as a secondary weapon, another has it as alternate fire and another has it as a different button all together.\n- Flares are kinda useless\n- Hitboxes for charge is huge.\n\nThere's a alien vs predator for a knockoff game I played about 7 years ago that does a better job of this type of gameplay. If I'd actually intended to buy it , instead of getting it in the humble bundle getting GoD Factory: Wingmen, I'd be incredible annoyed. Instead, I'm just disappointed.

Unfortunately the install always fails if you have a newer version of the framework (like 4.5) This causes your system to force restart in a minute.  And when windows boots back up, you're greeted with a message... That installation failed again and that your computer is going to reboot in a minute....\n\nTo avoid the loop don't click the close button on the error message.  Instead hit Ctrl+Shift+Esc to quickly pull up Task Manager.  under the processes tab find 'Setup.exe' and click on that and then the end process button at the bottom of the window.   Sure you wont be able to play the game because of the failed non-installation of Framework, but now you won't need to go crazy trying to fix your computer either.\n\nStrangely enough if you boot the game directly from your steam folder you avoid this nonsense altogethor and can hop in the game.","February 28, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"Unlike any you've previously experienced" is reasonably accurate. And I don't want to experience anything like it in a game again.\n\n- It looks and feels like a halflife mod. The default graphical settings look nothing like what you see in the preview above.\n- Tutorial really is needed. Especially for the flying dino to get a handle on the picking up mechanics and how to use the first aid/ammo kits (so many people jumping on top of them not knowing there's a use button)\n- No quickplay option\n- If the game is over the cap for number of T-Rexs it spawn you then says you can't be there and makes you wait an extra 5 seconds instead of something sensible like disabilng the button on the selection screen.\n- Single shot guns like the net and grenade launcher really should reload automatically instead of having to fire again.\n- Inconsistent binding between characters. One has grenades as a secondary weapon, another has it as alternate fire and another has it as a different button all together.\n- Flares are kinda useless\n- Hitboxes for charge is huge.\n\nThere's a alien vs predator for a knockoff game I played about 7 years ago that does a better job of this type of gameplay. If I'd actually intended to buy it , instead of getting it in the humble bundle getting GoD Factory: Wingmen, I'd be incredible annoyed. Instead, I'm just disappointed.

Graphics 7/10 no particular reasons. Gameplay is really fun especially if your a dinosaur. But the only other problem is that if your a human your chances of winning a match are really low compared to the dinosaurs who thrash the humans. For the relatively cheap price the game is brilliant! I would definitely recommend it to you if you like PVP styled battles.

One of the best features is that you don't just play as the Humans you also Play as the dinosaurs which makes the game that much better. When your playing as a Human and you see a T-Rex or Spinosaurus coming running at you, you feel the sense of sheer size of The T-Rex and Spinosaurus and get scared sometimes. There are still many servers alot of them full of players. If you are a fan of dinosaurs and want to feel the intensity of what it was like to fight a dino or be one DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY THIS!!! $15 bucks is a very reasonable price and worth every penny of your money, you won't be dissapointed .

Its simple, addicting, and entertaining.\n\nThe human teams feel like something out of an Alien vs Predator game, with the player never knowing if there's something leaping at him from behind, or scoping them out from above.  And there's always the general feel of hopelessness as you notice a T-Rex coming your way.\n\nThe dinosaur teams are entertainingly diverse, with each one serving a purpose.  The Novraptors are entertaining, and feel like the general soldiers of the team, as they're fast, do a lot of damage, and in plenty.  However, flying with the pternadon is a chore with its semi-buggy flying mechanics, and not very rewarding unless you like being helpful to your team, or just enjoy picking people up to drop them from the skybox.  The dilophosaurus are a bit underwhelming as well, being extremely underplayed because their only skills are utility, with their blinding/poison abilities.  And good luck trying to snatch a T-Rex role, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ does it look ♥♥♥♥ing fun.\n\nAll in all, I'm extremely happy with the game, but I have no illusions that is anything but arcadey fun.  Its not deep, and probably won't snag a thousand hours by anything, but it is entertaining, and something to quickly pick up and play.","November 28, 2013","true","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Why I even put as much time into this game is beyond me. Maybe because a little part of me tries to enjoy every last scrap of anything in this game that is considered "fun." That, my fellow gamers, is very rare to come by in this complete load of rubbish that the developers dared call a game.\n\nThere comes a time where people need to learn how to work together. It's how we get further in anything. If you are looking for a great and enjoyable experience with teammates, you came to the wrong place. The players in here are the worst people and seem to not understand the basic instincts of what it is to be a human. These ♥♥♥♥-nuggets, commonly referred to as players, mistake this game for Call of Duty, wherein you don't have to work together to win.

With the joining of teams, running around and shooting aimlessly, one would think it's just as boring as other "minor" shooters. But with a choice of either humans or dinosaurs, the game keeps it fresh and makes you think of your character choice. Small dinosaurs are great, but are easily trapped and killed with less health than the other dinosaurs. Bigger dinosaurs may seem overpowered at times and humans may seem to be handicapped being significantly smaller than the king lizards of the worlds beginnings, but with some sharpening of skills, any dinosaur can be brought down with a well placed sniper or grenade-launcher shot. Plus, playing as a T-Rex is badass.","December 27, 2013","true","9.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I’ll try and keep the amount of Jurassic Park quotes to a bare minimum for this review, but I make no promises, hold onto your butts.\n\nWhen the miracles of modern science have brought dinosaurs back to life, a ragtag group of humans have been sent to “The Island” in order to reclaim it after the prehistoric beasts have broken loose. Sound familiar? With no indication on where the island is located, it might as well be called Isla Nublar.\n\nDeveloped by Lukewarm Media, Primal Carnage provides fast team-based competitive online multiplayer action across a single game mode: Team Deathmatch. Each side – humans or dinosaurs – features five distinct classes, that when used in unison provide the best chance at winning the match.\n\nThe humans are played in first-person with each class equipped with a unique primary weapon – along with a secondary ability. The Pathfinder wields a shotgun, but also comes equipped with flares that can blind any nearby dinosaurs. The Trapper focuses on shooting nets, immobilizing the smaller dinos, while the Scientist can deplete the stamina of the larger dinos by firing tranquilizer darts. The Pyromaniac focuses on being a problem to any dinosaur that wants to get up close with a combination flamethrower and chainsaw. Meanwhile, the Commando comes equipped with a heavy machine gun and a grenade launcher – best used to take out the larger dinosaurs.\n\nOn the other side, the dinosaurs focus on getting up close and personal with their claws and teeth to rip the humans to shreds.This is in stark contrast to the humans play style of using ranged weapons to their advantage. While the game implies a first-person perspective for the humans, the dinosaurs feature a third person perspective. Feeling more versatile and nimble than the human counterparts, they are able to set traps and ambushes by peering around corners with ease. Novaraptors are at their deadliest when working in packs, ambushing their prey and leaping on their foes back while biting them to death. The Dilophosaurus is a support class, blinding it’s prey with a tar like spit that can also poison, while the Pteranodon can spot enemies for teammates, as well as carry and drop them over the nearest cliff. The two largest dinosaurs in the game – the Carnotaurs – uses it’s unbreakable head as a battering ram that sends humans flying through the air, while the mighty Tyrannosaurus can swallow people whole as well as crush everything beneath their massive feet. Each one also comes with a secondary roar ability, which provide buffs to nearby dinosaurs or like in the case of the raptor, it increases attack speed at the cost of stamina.\n\nAs you can see, both sides have unique play styles, yet both sides feel balanced. The class structure was set up so each side has a class better suited against a class on the other side. While Commandos can provide a steady stream of gunfire, the high recoil provides limited accuracy, making them a poor choice at taking down anything but the larger two species of dinos. On the other hand, the Trapper is best suited for trapping the smaller dinosaurs, while the Scientist and her sniper rifle can take down any Pteranodon circling in the air. Don’t expect to survive a one on one with a dinosaur, especially since you never know if one is waiting right around the corner. Clever girl.\n\nPlaying as a human, other humans are highlighted on the map allowing you to easily reach them upon respawn in order to have a better chance at survival. Some of the most intense moments I’ve had revolved around trying to reach the safety of inside a complex while trying to outrun a T-Rex. Moral of the story, if the T-Rex spots you, and you are all alone, be prepared to a prehistoric dinner.\n\nMuch like myself, everyone wants to play as the dinosaurs. Given everyone an equal chance, each round will flip the sides so everyone will get the chance at playing the hunter and the hunted. While only containing five maps, each one provides detailed landscapes full of lush vegetation, trees, tall grass, bushes and all manners of flora that sway with the breeze – as well when a mighty beast moves through them. Sunlight filters through tall tree branches and leaves, while buildings and other objects provide various levels of vertical terrain, all with impressive looking textures. The night time raining map in the thick jungle provides the most intense time you will have with the game, if you are playing on the human side. The thick foliage and lack of light keeps the tension high and keeps you guessing where the next raptor will jump out from. The dinosaur models and animation in particular stand out as a testament of what a dedicated team can achieve.\n\nNone of the visuals would mean a thing, if the game didn’t play well, but the old-school arcade style fits the game beautifully. When servers start to fill out, the action become chaotic with humans trying to stay together in order to survive with the threat of dinosaurs that cane come from any direction.\n\nSimply Put\n\nWith no progression system, stat-tracking or leaderboards – as of yet – Primal Carnage lacks features that many modern day games include from the get-go. Primal Carnage is light on features and content, but addicting gameplay provides hours of entertainment and most importantly fun, even if the game only currently has a single game mode. And with Lukewarm Media planning updates that will feature new game modes, maps, skins and more, Primal Carnage has brought dinosaur games back from extinction. Releasing for only $15 on Steam, you won’t have to spare no expense, like our dear friend John Hammond.","December 28, 2013","true","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Right? How does that ever work out for the humans? One word: Flamethrower. The maps are designed to be disorienting, and they maybe succeeded in this too well. It takes more than a few sessions to know what the hell is going on. The controls also are a little different, and you may need to rebind them if you're used to other shooters, or MMO's. The most frustrating thing for me was the dinosaurs' movement. When you manage to snag the Carnotaur, the charging controls are awkward to manage alongside the movement keys. At least they were for me. All that being said, you get to play this game as a dinosaur! And it does feel as awesome as it should once you get the hang of the controls and the map.

With the joining of teams, running around and shooting aimlessly, one would think it's just as boring as other "minor" shooters. But with a choice of either humans or dinosaurs, the game keeps it fresh and makes you think of your character choice. Small dinosaurs are great, but are easily trapped and killed with less health than the other dinosaurs. Bigger dinosaurs may seem overpowered at times and humans may seem to be handicapped being significantly smaller than the king lizards of the worlds beginnings, but with some sharpening of skills, any dinosaur can be brought down with a well placed sniper or grenade-launcher shot. Plus, playing as a T-Rex is badass.","December 27, 2013","true","9.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I’ll try and keep the amount of Jurassic Park quotes to a bare minimum for this review, but I make no promises, hold onto your butts.\n\nWhen the miracles of modern science have brought dinosaurs back to life, a ragtag group of humans have been sent to “The Island” in order to reclaim it after the prehistoric beasts have broken loose. Sound familiar? With no indication on where the island is located, it might as well be called Isla Nublar.\n\nDeveloped by Lukewarm Media, Primal Carnage provides fast team-based competitive online multiplayer action across a single game mode: Team Deathmatch. Each side – humans or dinosaurs – features five distinct classes, that when used in unison provide the best chance at winning the match.\n\nThe humans are played in first-person with each class equipped with a unique primary weapon – along with a secondary ability. The Pathfinder wields a shotgun, but also comes equipped with flares that can blind any nearby dinosaurs. The Trapper focuses on shooting nets, immobilizing the smaller dinos, while the Scientist can deplete the stamina of the larger dinos by firing tranquilizer darts. The Pyromaniac focuses on being a problem to any dinosaur that wants to get up close with a combination flamethrower and chainsaw. Meanwhile, the Commando comes equipped with a heavy machine gun and a grenade launcher – best used to take out the larger dinosaurs.\n\nOn the other side, the dinosaurs focus on getting up close and personal with their claws and teeth to rip the humans to shreds.This is in stark contrast to the humans play style of using ranged weapons to their advantage. While the game implies a first-person perspective for the humans, the dinosaurs feature a third person perspective. Feeling more versatile and nimble than the human counterparts, they are able to set traps and ambushes by peering around corners with ease. Novaraptors are at their deadliest when working in packs, ambushing their prey and leaping on their foes back while biting them to death. The Dilophosaurus is a support class, blinding it’s prey with a tar like spit that can also poison, while the Pteranodon can spot enemies for teammates, as well as carry and drop them over the nearest cliff. The two largest dinosaurs in the game – the Carnotaurs – uses it’s unbreakable head as a battering ram that sends humans flying through the air, while the mighty Tyrannosaurus can swallow people whole as well as crush everything beneath their massive feet. Each one also comes with a secondary roar ability, which provide buffs to nearby dinosaurs or like in the case of the raptor, it increases attack speed at the cost of stamina.\n\nAs you can see, both sides have unique play styles, yet both sides feel balanced. The class structure was set up so each side has a class better suited against a class on the other side. While Commandos can provide a steady stream of gunfire, the high recoil provides limited accuracy, making them a poor choice at taking down anything but the larger two species of dinos.

Really basic shooter game. The only thing unique about it is the ability to play as the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs are a little bit more fun, but the third person camera makes it close to impossible to really target where you're trying to attack.\n\nThe dinosaur textures are great, but everything else is pretty lackluster. The game feels more like a mod than a real game. Worth $5 max. Really disappointing because I was looking forward to finally having a fun dinosaur video game.
