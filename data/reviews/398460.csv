The underground world is being ruled by a puppet master who created the puppets to work for him in the mines, he enslaves them.\nWhat the puppets dont know is that there is a colourful and amzing world outside the mines. Blink and Tula accidently discover the outside world and decide to escape. They get captured and tula is torn in half. Her soul is now scattered (you will have to collect those pieces throughout the game in order to move to the next level), Blink is thrown in prison. This is where the game starts.\nYou have to escape and find all the soul pieces from Tula. To bring her back to life.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis is an arcade game where you have to defeat your enemies and outsmart obstacles. You have to avoid lasers and other dangerous traps, every map is different and offers new challenges.\nYou experience this adventure from a birds perspective, you see Blink and what Blink sees. Watch carefull around every corner as you embark on this journey.\nThe controls are really simple. WASD to move around.\nMouse to look around.\nLike the badass that I am, I chose for the  HARD  difficulty which was remarkably easy at first.\nBut I soon came to the conclusion that I made a big mistake choosing this difficulty. The first 15 levels were all pretty easy but then the nightmare began.\nI had to retry almost every level over 20 times to finish it. The satisfaction of finishing a level on hard difficulty.. it's great! \(^^)/\n\n\nPerformance , graphics and atmosphere.\n\nThe game runs fine and I encountered no glitches in the game so far.\nThe graphics are nothing special but they bring the griddy and dark atmosphere alive, it adds a unique feeling to the game.\nThe music also fits the game really well! The art style is great and everything is hand crafted by the developers.\nA big shoutout to the developers!\n\nLet's move on; the PROS and the CONS for Mooch.\n\n\nPros: Griddy dark atmosphere\nMusic fits the game well\nResponsive controls\nChallenging levels\nGood variety of enemies\nBoss(battles) are well designed\nGreat art design\nThrowback to older arcade games\nGreat fun for a good price\nLevel design is well done (fits your small field of vision)Cons:Some levels are really hard. maybe to hard.\nSome paths with traps are so narrow its hard to not fail.\nIf you die you have te replay the entire mission\nThe stress and frustration you get when you only needed one more and you die by the most random spikes on the walls\n\nFinal conclusion:\n\nMooch can be frustrating and a pain in the ♥♥♥ at some levels. But im sure as hell going to give it my best untill I complete every level!\nIts a great indie game developed by only a few people.\nI have to give credit for their great work.\nOverall the game is a great challenge and it has enough variety to make you keep coming back to finish that one level you couldn't get past. It entertains like no other and the music also suits the game.\nThe characters and levels are well designed and the bosses are a even harder challenge. For this price I'd say its well worth your time and money. Play it for 30 minutes to 1 hour a day untill you get frustrated and quit.\nAfter all you probably will come back the next day to finish what you started. The story is fine and the voiceacting was good enough. The gameplay is simple and solid.\n\n\nRating:\nThe game is well worth picking up for this price. Support the developers for their hard work!\nI would rate "Mooch" a solid 8/10!\n\nWant more recommendations? Come see our reviews on our favorite upcoming games!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hustlayo/recommended/398460/","hustlayo","hustlayo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hustlayo/","4308 products in account","The plot of Mooch is simple. The Puppet Master created puppets and forced them to work in the mines. Those poor puppets have no idea about the outside world until one of them, Blink, discovers that the outside world really exists. Blink and his friend Tula decide to escape the mines but one of the guards foils their plans by tearing Tula apart. Her soul becomes scattered across the underground and Blink has to find every piece of it before escaping.\n\nYou play as Blink and collect soul fragments which look like small, white orbs of light. There are 3 worlds, 24 levels in each one and every 8 levels there's a boss that the hero has to outsmart. That's right, outsmart as you don't have any weapons so your only option is to avoid enemies and run from them when necessary. The atmosphere is dark and even though you see the world from the top you can only see as much as Blink. That's mostly because underground is dark and Blink uses his flashlight mounted on his head to scatter the darkness. Music is nice and fits the atmosphere of Mooch very well. Graphics are also plausible and I especially like the fact that the gameplay takes place in the middle of the screen and the rest is dark - it creates an unique feeling and makes immersion into the game world a lot easier. I also have to say that the game is pretty challenging, I've finished roughly 50% of Mooch so far but I can already say that the second one world is definitely harder than the first one. But for those that don't like hard challenges and want to relax I can recommend "easy" game mode where everything is easier.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Very good gameplay\n+ Nice graphics\n+ Good, dark atmosphere\n+ Interesting music fitting the game very well\n+ Nice boss "fights"\n+ Challenging\n+ Sometimes makes you think\n+ Fair price\n\nCons:\n\n- If you die you have to replay the whole level\n\nOverall, I can recommend Mooch to pretty much everyone who likes indie adventure/stealth kind of games.","September 20, 2015","true","12.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","1"

In this dark underground world you and other same creatures forced to work to yours devil creator. Once you and your friend named Tula decided to escape from there, but sadly a lord captured you and your friend. Tula was been torn apart after this, the part of her soul was scattered in whole dark dungeon.\n\nSo this is a main story of game, your mission is first escape from a prison and collect all parts of you friend in this dungeon. But not all so easy how sounds. Here you will found a lot of different blades, enemies and bosses what you should avoid or beat. Overall more than 25 type enemies and 9 bosses you will found here. For all you should chose a different tactic and be very careful, because when you die you should start from the beginning the actual level. To beat a level you should collect all parts of souls on that level.  The game control is enough easy, with keyboard  you are moving and with mouse you are look around, also you can easily set a mouse sensitivity. Also a game have other very nice features for example a different story endings or a hidden passages.\nThe graphic style is awesome, this is enough dark but looks very good and also this is hand-crafted! The game sound are also good.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+different endings\n+nice hand made graphic\n+nice story\n+challenging gameplay\n+different enemies\n+music and sounds fits to game\n+easy control\n+steam cards and achievements\n\n-some level can be hard\n-sometimes can be frustrating when you die to many time\n\nWell this game is unusual an challenging. The atmosphere and style is really dark, this well fitting to the story. Sounds and music is also fit to this all well. You can set difficulty at start, but this not bring to much help in some levels, so if you die again and again its can be frustrating. Anyway i really can recommend this game if you are want to get a some unusual and challenging for enough good price.","February 16","true","5.0"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","1"

One of those games that kinda got buried by the avalanche of indie titles hitting the Steam store for a few years now. Tbh, I probably hadnt noticed it if a friend didnt tell me about it. A problem many indie devs experience.\n\nThe game is pretty simple. The main character, a puppet named Blink, is a slave working in the mines for the evil Puppet Master. He discovers there's a world outside the mines and decides to escape with his girlfriend. The girl gets caught and torn apart (ouch). Blink needs to fix this and he can do that by picking up all the soul orbs lying around each level, pacman style.\nEach level is small and is completed when all the orbs have been collected. That wouldnt be a difficult task if there werent some obstacles. The enemies are robots, trapped floor tiles, lasers, etc.\nAfter completing a number of levels you'll meet a boss. Until now I met The Spider Bot (who moves around the area shooting lasers and The Worm (a worm throwing bombs at you.) Pretty simple if you ask me but it makes the game a little less repetitive.\nSteering Blink is simple. Its WASD to move Blink and the mouse is used to rotate the camera.\nAnimations, graphics and sound effects are ok.\nOverall, its a nice little casual game. Better than most of the indie titles I've played. Its ok priced and it works on basically every pc or laptop.","March 3","true","8.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KinkyCyborg/recommended/398460/","KinkyCyborg","KinkyCyborg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KinkyCyborg/","5566 products in account","Mooch is a game that should be in every gamer's library because it has the perfect combination of story & atmosphere while equal amounts of arcade and strategy elements that make for a fun ride.\n\nThe story starts off rather sombre with the main character watching his friend being ripped apart and his ultimate decision to go collect the fragments of her soul. This sets the tone as you head off collecting her soul orbs as you progress through ever more challenging levels.\n\nI liken this game to a topdown version on Limbo where quick reflexes and a game plan are essential to completing a level. Death is at every turn as you bob & weave through flying saw blades, sentry robots and other booby traps. Even the walls in the often narrow passage ways are all blade edged and can kill with the slightest touch.\n\nI found myself getting frustrated on several levels but that just urged me to continue attempting different stratigies. The Worm boss shooting out his heat-seeking, exploding marbles was particularly challenging but very satisfying when you finally defeat it.\n\nIf it wasn't for the store page I would have never known there is controller support as there is no reference to it anywhere in the settings menus. After trying WASD & mouse controls I found I much more preferred using the dual analog sticks on my controller.\n\nI'm not sure of the country of origin for this game but I did notice some sentence structure issues in the intital game dialogue which I attribute to poor translation but it is not a deal breaker by any stretch and you still get the gist of what is going on.\n\nOverall I give this games two thumbs up and for the very affordable price it should be a no-brainer that you pick this one up. You won't be disappointed.","February 16","true","6.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/398460/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","I don’t have a whole lot to say about Mooch that isn’t already covered in the extraordinarily good Steam description, below. That and the fact that I am truly in a level of pain that my brain is attempting to cope with. Ainslie, who is a nurse, and I believe that I have at least partially torn my Achilles tendon and we cannot get to a doctor’s office until the morning. I really wanted to crank out this review today and I would have been disappointed in myself if I didn’t.\n\nBut look I really enjoy Mooch. It’s definitely among the better casual adventure/puzzle games that I have played. I’m not much of a precision gamer and often struggle with games of that nature. However, while I have died needlessly on a couple of levels I really enjoy the tricks and traps present in the game. It makes you play carefully but more than that it makes me eager to discover what is behind every corner. It takes a well designed game for that to happen and Crank Goblin have done extremely well to achieve that effect.\n\nI don’t want to delve into spoiler territory but I really enjoy the story here. I also had a great appreciation for the voice acting of the children. Given Crank Goblin is a polish developer I’m not sure why the child reminded me of an Australian accent. I’m probably, most definitely, hearing things but the voice over throughout the introduction really works for the game. I was suckered into it and fully immersed by the time that it was my turn to play the game.\n\nSome levels require a lot of thought into how you are going to defeat it. It’s not all precision based on reflexes. It’s a perfect combination of logic and hand-eye coordination. I find it somewhat disappointing that less than two thousand accounts own this game. That definitely makes the game a hidden gem and I will tell you having watched Molly tonight (biographical on Australian music industry legend Molly Meldrum) that you  should do yourself a favor and buy Mooch!","February 9","true","12.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

The sound effect when dying can work as a jump scare sometimes :)\n+ Mooch is an arcade/puzzle game , where you play pretty small areas each level and your goal is to collect the dots, that represent fragments of Tula's (your friends) soul, in a pacman style of game. At the same time you have to avoid numerous traps and enemies. Traps can be lasers, traps that appear from the floor as you walk over them, moving or static walls with spikes, holes in the ground and many more. Enemies are varied, most of them have a pattern you can watch and learn to avoid them, others explode when they touch you. Many boss stages that are unique each time and pretty hard to complete. Game has 3 worlds with many levels each and a unique setting each. Game is pretty challenging (at normal difficulty that i play, i can't imagine playing it at hard) , but most of the times nothing is random, but depends on your skill.\n+ Excellent controls, the movement of both blink and the camera is very fluid using wasd and mouse. Your field of view is what blink can see and this is done excellent as it plays a vital role in the gameplay itself. (usually you die from things that come outside your field of view).\n+ Pretty long for an indie game, completed the 1st world in 2 hours, although it starts pretty easy, you will die a lot and retry most of the levels numerous times.\n\n- More story elements with the use of cutscenes or notes would be welcome. (first cutscene was pretty nice, expected more later on).\n- Gameplay is sometimes unforgiving, maybe too hard, might loose patience and rage quit. Maybe a checkpoint system at low difficulty would please some. Not on normal or hard though since it would change the whole structure of the game.\n- Maybe a bug, but explosions generally should be coded better, since even if you avoid them, if you change the camera fast looking at them you will die.\n\nCertainly this is a great first effort from an indie developer , that managed to develop a pretty unique and polished game. A really smart game where nothing is random and progress depends on your skill. Recommended whether on sale or not.","February 24","true","5.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The storyline really reminds of a movie titled THX 1138, where a man is trying escape an underground oppressive and controlled society (basically a slave drone like Blink in Mooch).  But in Mooch (name of the world??) Blink at least has chance to bring his companion along if he manages to escape.  That is the point of the game, in fact, to collect little balls of light (pieces of your companion's soul/life force) as you scan this dark world of simple maze-like corridors while avoiding anything spinny, pointy, or tinged red, all of which are lethal.\n\nThere are 3 sections to this game with 24 levels per section.  Simple command movements WASD or the arrow keys up, down, right, left are used to move the character and the mouse scans the dark.  Patience, strategy and good timing are all virtues in this game.  There are also 3 challenge modes, easy, normal and hard.\n\nEach level restarts at the beginning if the player ends up a puff of black smoke, but do not despair, the levels are relatively short and small in size.  However, do not let that fool you, some levels are quite a challenge and there are the equivalent of mini-bosses as well as bosses.  There is plenty of strategy involved in trying to collect those tiny shiny balls of light.  At the beginning of each level the number of lights needed to clear the level is displayed and the number goes down as the light is collected.\n\nDefintely an engaging maze survivor game, with increasingly challenging levels, and challenging enough to be worth the price.","February 17","true","8.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

The story is a basic and incredibly similar rendition of Ori and the Blind Forest. I recommend Mooch just as much, and beware the players who consider themselves feint of heart. Your anxiety will be met with buzzsaws, homing missiles, and various devices from the 7th level of the Mines.","September 28, 2015","true","34.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The game draws from both Super meat boy and Teleglitch making for a refreshing and unique experience in sea of Early Access survival games and AAA FPS games, offering around 8 hours of playtime if you play on normal and double that if you play again on hard difficulty, making for a pretty worth while investment. Devs are great and frequently release patches on any issues players might have. I can personally recommend it to anyone who has atleast a bit of patience and doesnt require constant action CoD style. This game is solid 8/10","November 20, 2015","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a slower moving, "be careful" sorta game.  Nice controls, WASD to move each direction and mouse to turn your character.\n\nObject of the game is to put the love of your life back together after she is torn apart in the beginning little story by robots and scattered across numerous levels as "soul pieces".\n\nMy early score:  82% which might go up or down some as I play the game more, but that's a good first score I think based on what I seen so far.\n\nHope that helps!","September 7, 2015","true","0.3"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","12","22","3","0"

While escaping with his friend, Tula, they are caught and Tula torn apart. Now you as Blink must find the pieces of Tula's soul and bring her back to life and escape once again.\n\nThe game visuals are quite nice, reminiscent of Limbo. The view is top down and you can only see far ahead as Blink can, making it interesting both visually and mechanically. You can clearly see hazards as they are painted red.\n\nGameplay wise, the game is challenging yet fair.\nThe game is divided into three worlds, each world consisting of 24 levels.\nIn each level you have to collect a set amount of Tula's soul pieces before continuing to the next level.\nEach level is scattered with different hazards, ranging from spikes, robots, mines, lazers etc. Those hazards, which can, and will, kill you, will try to stop you from achieving your goal.\nEach few levels is a boss level. Each boss has a unique design and trick to find in order to defeat.\n\nThe levels start simple but can get quite hard and challenging quite fast, and you have to think and act fast if you want to survive.\n\nThe music in the game is a nice ambient music, contributing to the game nice atmosphere.\n\nIn conclusion I would recommend this game, especially if you have a few hours to fill!","February 20","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The level design is challenging enough that you can easily fail a number of times if you try to rush (and in some areas, move too slowly). The game does not have a timer, so taking your time is important as it will allow you to strategize your next move. Paying attention to your surroundings (even the areas you cannot see) are important. Many times focusing on one thing makes you lose focus and result on many deaths. The boss fights I've encountered are well thought out and will challenge your patience, reflexes and force you to strategize. However, you'll will feel a sense of completion upon .\n\nThe various languages options available are nice. The only issue I encountered, personally, is the game resolution seems to be locked as playing in 1440 resolution doesn't scale well as when playing in 1080. However, besides that, I recommend the game as it is worth your time if you enjoy arcade style games.","January 18","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mooch is strange, and definetly not a game for me, and I have to say, personally I did not enjoy it.\n\nThis type of a game is not for me, and if you are like me you won't enjoy it any more than I did, but what the game set out to do it does reasonably well. Nothing exceptional.\n\nStory is non existent, so if you are like me and like story and reason behind your gamples, you won't like the game too much.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is great, personally I'd say it is the absolute best thing about the game.Tight corridors and death behind every corner - perfect. My problem is - NO CONTEXT TO ALL OF THIS. If you don't mind that - try it out. It may surprise you.\n\nLet's just say, I am not a fan of the game, I did not enjoy it much, but I would recommend it for the price, it is cheap enough to justify trying it out. It definetly is not a game for me though and if you like me enjoy stories in games - you won't like Mooch much.","October 29, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

However it had so many things wrong with it. Instantly I found a gamebreaking bug that lets you run twice as fast by strafing with W + D (or A) and angling the camera. Also a majority of the levels have RNG. It's okay to have a small amount of RNG in games but if there's a level that when I use a necessary teleporter I could die entirely up to the game, that's not okay.","September 7, 2015","false","0.5"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","8","23","0","0"
