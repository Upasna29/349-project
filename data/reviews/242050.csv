Most fun I have had pretending to pirate since Sid Meier took a shot at it in the 90s. Largely addictive, great voice acting for the series, and dialogue that isn't painful to listen to on its own as well. This game could have a real shot as THE redefining moment for a series that has otherwise been largely stagnant. Unfortunately alot of those stagnations still exist here, repeated follow/eavesdrop missions for instance. All in all though this is easily what I would consider the BEST of the entire AC series since the first 2 games. Hope this is the start of a trend in making these more engaging and different/unique with each setting and iteration that follows.\n\nCheck it out if you're ready to hit the open seas with your own brig, exploring the beautiful environments of the West Indies.","November 25, 2013","true","61.6"," 930 of 1,078 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","930","1","0","52"

Great environments graphics, level design, interaction, and details to very small things.\nThis might be the best AC Title so far, and might also be GOTY.","November 25, 2013","true","179.4"," 577 of 678 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","577","678","0","16"

Why's that?\nWell, first of all, the main components are still the same.\n\nYou're playing as Edward Kenway, a pirate which ends up being involved in the Assassins vs. Templar war.\nThe gameplay didn't really changed, as you're still running and parcouring around in third-person. Climbing up on lookouts, to reveal the map, collecting stuff like chests and animus fragments, doing assassination missions and following the main quest about a mysterious observatorium.\n\nSo far, everything as usual. The one big thing which changed, or was rather heavily extended, is the ship you are sailing with.\nAlready introduced in AC3, you're also getting your own ship this time (of course, what would a pirate be without a ship ^^), the "Jackdaw". With said ship, you're spending a lot of time travelling through the caribbean sea, hunting down whales and sharks, exploring sunken ships and underwater caverns, battling other ships and boarding them to get gold and ressources in order to upgrade the Jackdaw (eg. more cannons, reinforced hull, different looking steering wheels or sails).\n\nIn my opinion, the part where you are sailing around and enjoying the dynamic day and night cycle, checking for profitable ships to hunt down or just enjoying the waves on the sea is the best part of the game.\nThe Sea Shanties (your crew will sing along on the open sea) are also great for the atmosphere and pretty entertaining (i found myself singing along with them :D ).\n\nThe story itself feels a bit bland and is starting off pretty boring in my opinion.\nBut it gets better throughout the missions and there are quite some interesting and likable characters which improves the story after the beginning.\n\nThe graphic is pretty good, nothing groundbreaking, but very atmospheric and it can create some beautiful moments, especially with the day and night cycles.\n\nThe world itself is also quite big, with enough places to visit and roam around to fill hours and hours of gametime. If you don't like collecting stuff or repetitive missions/ship battles, then you might be bored after a while. Even though the ship battles feel quite dynamic, at some point, it's still quite the same (especially if you upgraded your ship and you're more powerful).\n\nOverall, i found it to be a "different" Assassin's Creed title, as i had the feeling that component wasn't overly present. I had much more fun sailing around and exploring, than following the main mission. But i think that's also pretty subjective. It's still a very good game and i would recommend it to anyone liking the AC titles and/or good action-adventures, especially with a very good pirate-flair.\n\nNow, drink up me hearties and get back aboard, treasures are waiting, arrrr :)","March 20, 2015","true","53.6"," 216 of 234 people (92%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","92","216","234","32","9"

And I'm a diehard fan of this series.\n\n\nNow let's start by a simple pros/cons:\n\nPros:\n\n+The game doesn't take itself too seriously.\n+You really feel like you are a pirate, so careless and free to do what ever you want.\n+Almost no map limitations; after the few first missions, you are basically granted the opportunity to explore the world as much as you wish, which hasn't been possible in previous titles. And exploring is as interesting as it can get! Massive amount of islands, fisherman villages, caves, mayan ruins, plantations etc. And the game also rewards you alot for exploring.\n+Character design. Edward is an interesting main character and to be honest; there has never been a side character so cool as Edward Thatch, or well, as most of us know him as, Blackbeard.\n+Map. It's just... big. And full of places. After 50+ hours on the game, I'm still finding new islands to explore.\n+The amount of side activities. Ranging from the usual assassination contracts to defeating legendary ships, you will not run out of things to do.\n+Free roaming. Well, this isn't anything new to Assassin's Creed series, but the addition of freely sailing the seas and countering plenty of other ships to board and rob out of their cargo, this game takes freedom of play to a whole new level.\n\nCons:\n\n-Optimizing is quite bad (which really isn't a surprise though), as the game will be somewhat laggy even on better gaming rigs. Don't expect too many FPS with high graphichs if your PC isn't top notch. It's not unplayable on computers that aren't as good, absolutely not, but you should be prepared for certain FPS drops and lowering your graphic quality etc.\n-The story is quite short (NO SPOILERS) and sometimes feels like it's a bit too much "go there and kill him so we can be rich arrr!". Story isn't bad, I really enjoyed it, but I still hope it would've been a bit more deep in some aspects.\n\nSummary:\nThis has got to be one of my favorite games of all times, as it never fails to excite me. Are you a diehard fan of the series or just looking to be the "deadliest scourge of these seas"? Either one, this game is for you!

I' m in love with ac2 but ac4 is almost as good as my fav part. It has beautiful, big world which you can easly explore. A lot of quests, stuff to collect. Nice combat. Maybe some easy... but its not a big minus of whole game. Storyline is really intresting (dunno what to write here to not spoiler... Its just awesome!). Music and graphics are on high level, great atmosphere of pirate world, ship battles, pirate songs, treasures, just everything what you can connect with pirates.\nI think only one minus is this ship/pirate stuff... for me personally its too much. It makes from it more pirate than assassin game. But still you can find a lot of sneaky mission and assassin atmosphere.\n\nMultiplayer:\nHere I' ve spent much more time. And I stil play it. I promise you, you will not find 2nd multi like this. Its still great fun with friends. A lot of nice modes, playing tactical or just jumping around. Abilities are balanced, perks also. I think I can say its the best multi of ac series. Really enjoy it. Just one minus are people who often play unfair... But its not game fault, just people carying for winning far too much. I think only game fault is that it has not so good matchmaking and sometimes you wait for session ages.\n\nIn my opinion, no matter if you buy it to play singleplayer, for multiplayer or for both i can promise you, you will enjoy it!

I guess there's not much to add if you're familiar with the rest of the series.\n\nWell, the combat. It's hasn't improved, infact, it changed a little bit for the worse; it's not as spectacular as it used to be and feels kind of clumsy to control. The good part is you can have up to 4 preloaded pistols, so at least thát helps. Either way, you really should use all your tools in this game, they're totally OP compared to the lack of fighting skills.\nI guess it's because you play some stinking peasant turned pirate, rather than a trained assassin. Which is actually a nice change; being no part of either templar or assassin but getting in too deep to avoid the crossfire. The story does unfold quite nicely.\n\nThe new things in this game are obviously the ship battles, gimmick from the last game. Well, not too surprising since they went with a pirate theme. Most of the game is either at sea, or in ports. A lovely addition to the sea travel are the shanties; a few drunks singing a song makes the trip more enjoyable, so it pays off to search for a few.\n\nThe fun and yet frustrating part is boarding a ship to capture it. Somehow the controls suddenly go more wonky than usual when climbing the sails. Especially when there's a few waves moving the ship. And the decks always feel way too small with the amount of people getting in your way.\nBut most of the boardings look really cool and are fun to do for a while.\n\nThen there's a whole new creature to hunt for; the Great White, and his nautical buddies.\nAlthough whaling is basically just chucking spears at the beast untill it stops flopping, it's pretty cool.  And the sharks do put up quite a fight.\n\nOh, and another wonderful thing they added is; underwater levels. Because we all know how much people love underwater levels. They actually looks quite magical.\n\nOutside of the Animus there's a few computers to hack, and obviously a less action-packed part of the story going on. Strangely enough you seem to be an Abstergo employeé this time around...\n\n\nAlthough they really should've included all the DLC's if they wanted to ask such a high price for it, oh well, I bought it anyway when it was on a sale, I blame the pirate theme, ARRR.\nI guess I can't complain, all'n all, it's an entertaining game, pretty much worth what I paid for it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kebhow/recommended/242050/","kebhow","kebhow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kebhow/","733 products in account","TLDR; This is, as far as my experiences go, the best Assassin's Creed game I have ever played. or maybe it's because I have a thing for pirates-themed games, I don't know. Story is there but certainly not the best part of the game. it's just there because every game needs one. it's the mechanics that works so well and contents that can make you spend 100 hours to complete all things in the game, that's not including the multiplayer (which I haven't tried).\n\nthe old and tested formula of the AC series is still there, but this time there are only 3 huge cities which still looks similar to other cities in the previous AC games and also looks similar to each other. The fun part is on the sea. It is a seamless experience that is so well implemented that it feels hassle-free and very fun at the same time. For an example, you can do an assassination side mission, then right after you kill the target you can just jump into your ship, drives away, and wreak havoc shooting every passing ship that passes by.\n\nNaval Combat is the highlight of this game for me. there are a lot of different types of weapons. Your typical round shots, chain shots, mortars, heavy shots, fire barrels, and swivel gun. you can choose what to do with an enemy ship. destroy it till it sink and get 50% of its cargo, or damage it enough to be able to board a ship (kinda like in pokemon, lol). the boarding is fun, too. you'll get different objectives which I think is randomized. usually you'll be told to kill a certain amount of enemies depending on how big that ship is. then sometimes you are also given other minor objectives.\n\nI'm sure all people who have play any AC games know the part where you have to climb up to a vantage point and synchronize to unlock the locations of all secrets in a location? it's still there, but now you also have to do that on the sea, but through destroying a fort in an area. the global map is divided into about 15 parts (never counted the exact amount), and each part's surface is blurred until you destroy the fort's defenses and then get to the fortress and kill the commander (somewhat like fighting a ship, just harder).\n\nBeside the main story and synchronizing at seas, there are tons of activities you can do when you get bored. you can find treasure maps and then look for the location, solve mayan puzzles, dive underwater to collect treasures, sneaking to a warehouse and steal materials to sell, hunting legendary ships, collect music sheets which unlocks new chants your crew sings when you are exploring the sea, hunt animals on land to unlock upgrades and craft outfits, and also harpooning sharks and whales.\n\nupgrading your ship is also essential to be able to progress through the game. you will have no chance fighting a huge ship with only a handful of cannons and low hull armor. this is part of the fun, making your ship stronger and then pawning those cocky spanish / british fleet (try using your upgraded ship to destroy 3 frigates in a row, it's fun !).\n\nthere is also a kind of mini games where you have a fleet of ships which you can send to do shipping missions that require a certain amount of time to complete, like most social games out there. If you have friends who also play this game, they can help your ship complete the mission faster. you can add captured ships to the fleet to make them able to complete bigger missions with bigger rewards. there's also a simple turn based combat system to make a trading route safer. it's pretty fun at first but in the end you just click everything and then forget about it (like social games).\n\nnow for the negatives. I feel that the secrets and chests you can find on the global is too scattered (maybe it's meant to be that way). I've been meaning to collect everything but there's just too many things to collect (I'm sure it's a good thing for some people).\n\nthe stealth aspect felt improved but still needs some tweaking. it's pretty difficult to move quickly from cover to cover when Edward wants to climb and jump on everything (it's annoying). not a significant problem though.","November 25, 2013","true","68.7"," 268 of 366 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","268","366","0","8"

I did some research and found out a LOT of people have this issue. I decided to open a support ticket with Ubisoft so I logged in to their support site. I went through the 'Submit a question' option to explain the issue. When I click submit it take me to a list of possible solutions, none of which are even close, and says if these dont fix your issue click submit. Only the submit button does nothing. I click on 'My Questions' only to have no new questions there. I tried this three times and could not submit a question.\n\nI then went to the Ubisoft technical support forum to post about the Black Flag issue and the Submit a Question issue. I typed out my new post and tried to 'submit' it. It tells me I have to choose a 'thread prefix' so I choose one from their drop down box and click submit. It blanks out my thread prefix and tells me I have to choose a thread prefix. I think maybe this is a bug because I didn't have a thread prefix selected when I first submitted. I retype the entire post, choose a prefix and click 'submit' only for the forum to blank out my thread prefix and tell me I need to choose a thread prefix.\n\nI finally had to reply to someone else complaing  thread because I could not create my own. Uplay and Ubisoft have forced me to change my review as I do not want my friends to have to go through this crap.","December 13, 2013","false","132.2"," 407 of 586 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","407","586","2","31"

Ubisoft STILL has utterly failed to correct their major game save issues. Regardless of whether or not you use or disable their horrible "cloud save feature", your games will STILL randomly disappear with no hope of recovery. I am at my wit's end with these thieves. They absolutely refuse to respond to anybody (a huge number of people) who have had this problem with anything other than a canned reply about "we're sorry but your saves can't be recovered" even if the damned inquiries have nothing to do with recovering game saves, but are asking if and when they are ever going to fix this game-breaking issue.\n\nWhat's more, they seem to have changed how the game is saved, so while previously, there was a possibility of recovering your game saves if you were lucky, that now seems to not be the case.\n\nOver two years in, it's clear what their answer is - NO, they are NOT going to fix it. I've tried playing this game on three different operating systems and two different computers (Windows 7, 8 and now, 10) and I have the same problem over and over and over.\n\nTake your money elsewhere. Ubisoft does NOT deserve your money and YOU don't deserve to have to deal with thier absolute indifference to their customers and their horrificly broken "games".\n\nI say all this with a very heavy heart, because in the time I have been able to spend playing Black Flag, I absolutely LOVED it, but I simply cannot support a game and its developer when they are uncaring ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s whose only concern is to pocket as much of your money as they can before moving onto their next monthly installment of Assassin's Creed.\n\n\n\nWarning - this game WILL eat your game saves, it is inevitable and is happening on a mass scale and Ubisoft doesn't appear to care, based on their very few comments on the problem.\n\nI really enjoy the naval aspect of the game, although I wish that there were more ship types. There is not a very large variety at all. Also, too many bonuses and unlocks for the multiplayer side of the game, which I don't really care about (ESPECIALLY because there is NO naval aspect to MP at all, only running around on land.) I don't play a single-player story for hours and hours only to earn useless costumes and other crap for multiplayer, thanks...Also, almost all the DLC and the crap you get with the preorders is almost all MP content only. I was under the impression that it was for the single-player campaign as it was marketed that way.\n\nAlso, after putting in over 200 hours on this game (even though I'm just over 50%, which goes to show I really enjoy playing this game) Uplay and/or the game decided it today, for no apparent reason, to completely wipe my game save. I booted it up to play today and it's simply gone without a trace. WTF.\n\nUPDATE - after further research, it's stunning how many people are also having their game saves wiped. I don't recommend this game solely because of this MAJOR problem. Trust me, you don't want to be like me (and all the other countless people having this problem) and spend 200+ hours of your life doing something that some crappy software that is forced on you (Uplay) is going to nulify on a whim. Their "cloud storage" system is a gimmicky piece of crap that will ruin your week.\n\nI'm sorry I spent as much money as I did on this game and all their BS DLC, the majority of which is not useful for ANYTHING in the game. This is probably the last Ubisoft game I'll be buying unless they get their act together, as their past games have also had issues like this.\n\n\nFINAL UPDATE - for others who've been screwed out of their game saves, one possible way o recover your saves that worked for me is as follows:\n\nJust for future reference for anybody that is searching for answers on how to recover a lost game save:\n\n1) Navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\n2) right click the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder and choose properties\n3) Click Previous Version\n4) Hopefully there is a pervious version backed up. if so you can double click it in the list.\n(There will be a folder in there with a long chain of numbers as its name. Inside there will be one or more folders with a couple numbers for their name. These are the gamesaves for whatever Ubisoft games you have. BLACK FLAG'S gamesave folder is '437'. Copy that one and replace your current damaged one.)","January 11, 2014","false","237.3"," 177 of 243 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","177","243","2","1"

It was around this time I thought it would be a good idea to hunt for different animals so I could get better gear (more pistol capacity, better armor, etc.). There I was, wandering on some island near cuba when I saw a sea turtle. With my head filled thoughts of turtle armor and other possibilities, I shot it, not thinking much of it. Edward saunters toward the turtle and I press the button to take my reward from the carcass. Nothing. I try again and again, growing more desperate each time. I am experiencing flashbacks of myself several seconds ago, laughing maniacly as I unload round after round of lead into the unsuspecting sea creature.\n\nI am crying now. I just wanted to be a pirate."What have I become?" I ask myself, half sobbing, half screaming. I cannot tear my eyes away from the unmoving turtle corpse. My high hopes of sweet turtle armor have transitioned to thoughts of suicide. I am a murderer now. I push myself away from my computer desk and fall to the ground into a pool of my own excrement. My mother walks into the room to see her only son covered in his own filth and muttering the word "turtle" over and over. She sheds a single tear. She knows what I have done. She quickly calls the cops on me and has me arrested. I don't fight the officers as they lift me up from my fecal pool and into their cruiser. I get sentenced to death for voluntary turtle slaughter of the first degree. I don't order a last meal, because all food tastes like sea turtles and shame now.They take me to the electric chair and tie a blindofold around my eyes. I don't struggle anymore. I am numb.

But if you're getting it on PC understand you're playing a game of russian roulette with it.  This game has multiple tech issues.  I've experienced constant crashing when turning on AA, god rays, anything other than low shadows, etc etc.  This is odd, because I've got a powerful rig that has the game on maxed textures and plays numerous others maxed out with those options enabled but, sure, whatever, we'll say something is wrong with my computer and not BF.  There's also the issue that if you use UPlay's cloud saving the game will eat your save, causing you to lose hours of progress.  I personally LOST FIVE HOURS OF PROGRESS.  This even happend to a previewer on RockPaperShotgun.  Checking the forums, others have lost completed games, with the average loss being 8 hours.  Some users insist this continues after turning off cloud saves, so back up your saves too!  There's also the issue I may have had that this game may not play nice if you don't install it on the same drive with your windows install, although this seems to be true for other Ubi titles (like BlackList) (I can't pinpoint this one for me because I reinstalled and also changed graphic options at the same time which stopped crashing but which one fixed it(?), but other forumers have the drive issue).  And some users (thankfully not me) have the game crash on the splash screen.   Also, if you have a laptop apparently this game doesn't play nice with those and the integrated graphics cards involved, so do your research?  Don't know much about that one, currently using a desktop.\n\nThis is a great game.  The gameplay is rock solid.  But I can't recommend it in good consciouscience because I don't want anyone to buy it, or worse, gift it, and not have it work.  That's an awful, frustrating feeling and I don't want anyone to feel like I did.  So no, the other reviewers are not wrong for recommending it.  Their time HAS been positive!  Mine hasn't.  It just is what it is, it's part of the baggage of PC gaming and it rears its ugly head now-and-then.\n\nHowever, make sure you turn off cloud saving no matter who you are and back up your saves.  This is a nasty bug for UPlay that doesn't care how great your machine is.  Imagine doing all the sync points or collecting all the collectibles on mutliple islands only to lose them.  It sure stinks.","December 10, 2013","false","49.7"," 242 of 343 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","242","343","0","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesgtslaughter/recommended/242050/","thesgtslaughter","Captain Barbossa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesgtslaughter/","15 products in account","For the most part, Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is a fantastic game. For ease of interpretation, I have decided to break my thoughts on the game down into a simple pros and cons list.\n\nPros:\nThe open world sailing/plundering/exploring while aboard the Jackdaw is by far the best aspect of the game.\nThe main storyline is decent (aside from the classic Assassin's Creed "outside the animus" sections that everyone hates)\nCombat is fluid and easy to learn although it was very clearly designed for console\nAll of the enviornments are beautiful and well designed\nVoice acting was well done and there weren't too many NPCs with the same voices.\nThe upgrade system seems pretty reasonable outside of the fact that, once you have enough money, you can basically buy every upgrade without putting in any work to collect materials etc.\n\nCons:\nThe game was very much designed for console which produces quite a few problems for PC users.\nThe Ubisoft launcher is absolutely terrible and I have had several problems getting it to boot up properly. Also, you will be unable to play the game if your Ubisoft launcher has problems so there is no way to bypass this terrible system.\nEven with a fairly well built gaming PC, higher level graphics options are etremely taxing and framerate drops are common.\nGameplay becomes repetitive after a certain point and the quests outside of the main storyline aren't anything to write home about.\nAfter you have maxed out all of the upgrades for the Jackdaw/Edward, nothing really presents a challenge.\nVery little replay ability\nThe cutscenes for sucessfully boarding a ship are all identical except for the fact that they are re-skinned depending on if the ship is Spanish, English, or pirate hunters. This is quite annoying if you pillage more that 10 ships (you definitely will)\nI already mentioned this above, but the "real life" sections of the game where you exit the animus are TERRIBLE! Every time one came up, I found myself saying "please end this stupidity so I can go back to the story that I care about." Perhaps some people feel differently about these scenes, but most seem to agree that the game would have been better if they had been left out all together.\nMultiplayer is clunky and feels like an afterthought. There is no real opportunity to play with friends in the way that would actually be fun (a fleet of customized ships sailing around engaging in massive battles and accomplishing various goals)\n\nConclusion:\nI really did (and still do) enjoy this game. There are very few high quality pirate themed games on the market and Black Flag definitely fills that need. The game is by no means a masterpiece of storytelling, nor is it a real divergence from the classic Assassin's Creed model. However, it is a ton of fun to play (especially if you love pirates) and the add-ons for the delux edition are worth playing as well. I would give this game a rating of 7/10 simply because of the clunky conversion from console to PC and the constant issues with the Ubisoft launcher. If Black Flag was as good on PC as it is on console, I would give it a 9/10.","December 21, 2015","true","248.3"," 66 of 77 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","66","77","10","9"

Sure, we have had games that use a theme around piracy, say Skies of Arcadia’s sky pirates or the pirate theme of The Secret of Monkey Island, but there’s never been one game that has managed to blend in the concept of being a pirate, exploring the ocean and visiting islands quite like how it is done in Ubisoft’s increasingly popular Assassin’s Creed series.Ubisoft has learnt from the blunders of the incredibly slow introduction that Assassin’s Creed III featured. This is great news for fans or newcomers, as it means people jumping into Black Flag don’t have to sit through hours of slow paced story plots and tutorials to understand the game’s mechanics. Within the time frame that it took the player to start playing Connor in Assassin’s Creed III, you’ve already learnt pretty much everything that you can do in the world of Black Flag. Even better is that the main character, Edward Kenway, the grandfather of Connor, is a much more likeable person. He’s got an aura around him that was missing from the forever-straight behaviour of Connor. The overall tone of Black Flag is much more light-hearted in nature, thanks to the comical and carefree personality of the Welsh pirate, which is on display throughout the game’s many cutscenes.Story wise, Black Flag takes place a few decades before the main events of Assassin’s Creed III, and is set in a vast ocean filled with the tropical islands of the Caribbean. It begins with Edward in the midst of a storm fighting with another ship, which just happens to house an Assassin. Things go horribly wrong and Edward is washed onto a beach, along with the Assassin that killed some of his crew members. Like any good Welsh man, he gets revenge and plunders his gear, becoming a pirate masquerading as an Assassin.The plot is filled with Assassins and Templars – it’s in the franchise’s DNA to do so – as they all hunt down a thing called the Observatory. What makes this story different is the piracy theme. Edward doesn’t care much about the Assassins or Templars and their thousand year war; he just wants to have the Observatory for himself, so that he can become the wealthiest pirate that ever lived. With no loyalty to either gang, you see Edward acquiring help from both sides as he tries to gain clues and figure out where this special place is hidden.Edward’s personality and the game’s theme makes the story an interest one, and it’s backed up with fascinating supporting characters that include famous pirates like Blackbeard (Edward Teach) and James Kidd. The sci-fi elements still remain – Abstergo are featured in the present time, as the player is put into the role of an employee working at Abstergo Entertainment. Near enough from the get go the entire game’s world is available to explore. There are some areas that are pumped with harder difficulty to make it less welcoming for the player to sail there, but once the boat is obtained, the ocean really is the only limit. The world is huge, and what is even more impressive is that it’s filled with lots of unique locations that contain plenty of secrets to discover.While it’s easy to get lost in discovering new land and finding collectibles, there are three major cities, Kingston, Havana and Nassau, that Edward will revisit on multiple occasions. Each city feels alive and distinct from one another, and all are packed with plenty of hidden collectibles to find.Black Flag builds a lot on top of the ship components of the previous title. You’ll take part in plenty of ship combat, but thankfully that has been fleshed out with better controls of the ships weaponry.You no longer need to remember what button launches what attack, as depending where the camera is focused will determine what weapon will launch. But Black Flag is more than just blowing up boats, as when conquered ships are on their last legs, the player has the chance to pull in and board the vessel. Once aboard, a required amount of crew must be killed before the ship’s goods become your own. There are plenty of side quests to do when out on the seas, such as hunting down whales or other creatures and using the materials gained from carving animals to improve existing gear, similar to 2012’s Far Cry 3.Combat is still easy, continuing with the comparable counter-heavy fighting system that we have seen in games like the Batman Arkham series, but with less fluidity in animation. A change to the interface means equipping gear is snappy, and using dual pistols is as easy as pulling the shoulder button to aim or pressing Y to shoot at an auto target. If there’s one thing the combat can pull off, it’s that it looks flashy when you have mastered the skills and are taking down a group of guys.When you’re done with the story and all its crazy additional side-questing, there’s the multiplayer that can be jumped into. If you’ve played the previous games, then you have an idea how it works. It follows the same principles of finding the target and killing them, while not getting stabbed by the people that are hunting you.What I did spend a lot of time doing is looking in awe at how beautiful the game can be. Black Flag looks fantastic on the PC, with some thirst inducing ocean and wave effects that are some of the best generated in a video game. The world also looks great, with a lot of detail going into making a believable incarnation of the West Indies, with quality texture work and decent models.Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is an amazing pirate game, and also my favourite Assassin’s Creed title, which goes hand in hand with the more open nature of the pirate theme.","February 9, 2015","true","114.6"," 84 of 105 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","84","105","8","7"

As a player you'll be working in Abstergo and entering the animus to relive the life of Edward Kenway and you'll be sailing a large area of the Caribbean sea during the age of piracy. more than 40% of the game takes place in the sea which you'll be sailing and pirating.\n\nThis is quite possibly the BEST pirate game up to date without the stereotypical aspects of piracy.

Ending was super expected if you follow the series.\n\n-Some of the really awsome characters in this game make REALLY short cameos, Kid the pirate and blackbeard etc. They are fantastic and memorable but you didn't get much time with them to feel the connection\n- This game was bugged when it came out, I couldn't 100% it and drove me nuts\n-Not enough end game content You can only fight 4\n\nOverall a much better game than all previous games, will make it hard to replay the old ones if you touch this one, even going back to HD remakes will make you go bleh.","February 23, 2014","true","86.6"," 116 of 154 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","116","154","0","0"

While I hated teh ending off this game it had a ton of solid content and the main questline had some outstanding moments gameplay wise. The side missions and exploration are even better offering stories of their own and allowing you to make your own story.\n\nAssassins Creed 4, Not revolutionary, but awesome!

Read at the end for that, if your PC meets the RECOMMENDED or close to (not minimum at all) by all means get an enjoy the game. If you do not carry anything above 2.7Ghz / or an HDX8XX + or one of the newer GTX models you WILL NOT run this game at good speeds.\n\nHands down the best Assassin's Creed game since AC2, and an amazing pirate game by it's own right.\n\nAs soon as you start the game up, it starts up in high action and puts you in a storm, taking control of a vessel as soon as you're able to move and fight off the invading Navy after that ship's captain was killed. You play as Edward Kenway, a brash, young pirate in hopes of landing it big and living it easy, and right away the game tells you a bit of his backstory and you're given control of Edward yet again and gain access to the Assassin robes and his weapons of preference, two long swords.\n\nThe game is visually a treat, with vegetation and fauna being more alive than ever in an AC game, just on the first island alone, you can see tiny crabs walking alongside the sand , you can see turtles moving about, seagulls flying above, etc the game feels alive thanks to these touches of detail - that's not even mentioning the amazing texture work the game has overall, the grass moves as you swivel through it, the water reacts to every little force and as you sail you get to see the waves far off move back and forth as they crash alongside your ship as you sail through the vast open world, arguably the biggest in any AC game to date, and explore every island to your heart's content.\n\nIn regards to the already standarized systems found in previous AC games - the combat feels more like AC1 in it's execution, with counters not being as obvious and enemies being more aggresive, it makes you actually worry a bit and forces you to slow down and pick your fights as you can't take many hits in combat unlike in certain previous AC games. The regenerating is back for this game, and you will actually need it, as playing reckless will see you low on health more often than not as well as some enemies being almost impervious to kill counters mix in among those that are. Stealth has also been improved from the previous games, but it still isn't the best trait the game has, enemies still have the unrealistic bobble icons that flash from yellow to red and can be alleviated easily by just hiding in tall grass or sides o buildings, etc, but enemies DO react faster upon seeing you, making the experience slightly more intense and stealth a more viable option than in previous AC games.\n\nAs far as new mechanics and things to do go: the naval combat has been GREATLY improved from AC3's. It involves 3 points of attack - Front (releases a bolo like cannon that slows down enemy ships), Side (Standard Damage dealing cannons) and Back (Drops fire barrels to stop ships from sneaking up on you and ramming your vessel) as well as a new attack mode that fires a concentraded cannon fire on enemy ship weakpoints to deal massive damage (you'll be using this a lot too) and every single Navy encounter feels more like a duel when out at sea, it is amazing. On top of that, lowering an enemy ship's value to red, and then parking alongside them will allow you to board their ship, you can choose to either down their ship entirely, or board them and take the full cargo to your ship as well as potentially add new crew members.\n* * In addition, there's also hunting (in both land and sea) land is like AC3, you find and kill critters on different islands and skin then for items that can be used to upgrade your holsters, etc for a bigger inventory space and extras for your character and in the sea you get to experience the joys of feeling like Captain Ahab and hunting that great white. :P\n\nThe Seafarer's Adventures ~ This game as a whole is an AMAZING pirate game by itself. Traveling feels a lot like Legend of Zelda Windwaker, and I am amazed at how much of an improvement this game is compared to the mediocre AC3. Combat and the standardized AC mechanics have been greatly improved, the character itself is charming and lovable as far as rogue adventure types go and the game itself is a treat visually and sounds amazing too thanks to the amazing composition by Brian Tyler.\n\nA+++ One of my faves this year no doubt.\n\nEDIT: For now I have to unrecommend this game due to the large amount of bugs and issues the game currently has on PC. While I did love this game, I cannot for the life of me understand just what the hell Ubisoft is doing with this game. Performance before that PhysX patch was shoddy at best before, but now it's almost borderline unplayable, and even unplayable for a lot of people. I have a friend with an amazing Rig that can't even get past the damn Uplay Launcher and I have to run the game at 1280x resolution to maintain at LEAST a 28 - 30 FPS on both PCs. Until Ubisoft fixes some of these issues OR a new driver that makes this mess playable it's literally a "Your Mileage may Vary" kind of thing.

Mostly because its amazing, and no game with an "animus" in the story should be called amazing. The other AC games are good don't get me wronge I like them alot; but, not GTA, Fallout, Elder Scrolls good. Black Flag is nearly just that. Everything in the game is polished and open. The naval combat is a blast :p, and the melee combat is great. My only gripe is it is restricted to typicall AC themes. I.E. don't killing civilians, no taking someone elses ship and building that one up, limited to what weapons you can hold on to. The story is ok, but sometimes unbearably in accurate how they portray real pirates(simular to ACIII), and they are just there to move the plot. The whole animus thing is bearley a discussion and is still needless. They could have just made it you are a pirate, go and pirate things. No need for the same old story of made up blah blah in historical local, but the open world lets you forget about that.\nWith the world being so big and grand, and your crew singing while you sail its easy to get sucked in. The mini games are a lot of fun and at  times just I just like to play a game of checkers while listening to the "live band" who will play period music.(and each region gets their own songs based on the inhabitants. Like a English settlement will play old English and Irish songs) One grip I do have for this game is its a bear to run. Most are lucky to see 30FPS. I modded it and it tends to run around 45-50fps at 1080 with ultra on everything but shadows with an i7, 2gb nVidia, and 16gigs ram. So make sure you can run it. This is a game I would highly recommend to people who even hate the series, because this AC shouldn't of bothered with the name Assassins Creed #. No it is to good!

Unfortunately,  its game play is as shallow as its world is vast, and its mechanics are pathetically anemic for an annualized franchise.  I'm writing this review after having completd only about half of the main story, because I'm debating whether or not to continue.  After 20 or so hours the aspects of the game that were initally fun have beocme boring and repetive, and its shortcoming are a constant source of frustration.  Quite simply, the game is no longer fun to play.\n\nGraphics quality is good.  The story is decent, although it unfolds most through cut-scenes and linear missions.  Combat is the same brain-dead block and parry nonsense that got old in the original Assassins Creed.  Free run as glitchy as ever, and quite often freely decides to move in a direction that defies all logic, often resulting in a spectacular plummet from heights that took several minutes of diligent manuerving to achieve.  Stealth is even more poorly implemented.  Auto-stealth zones are a poor man's stealth mechanic, and AC IV continues to use them liberally. The combination of simplsitic stealth and imprecise movement is a recipe for frustration.  Many times I have been hangling from a ledge with a guard patrolling above, waiting for the pricise moment to pounce... When suddenly I jump up right in front of him no apparent reason, triggering an alarm and failing the segment.  Such fundamental flaws are unforgivable after a half dozen or so AC release iterations.\n\nIn all fairness, resource gathering and crafting is greatly improved.  Sea battles are the source of raw materials for upgrading your ship, and upgrades are a neccesity to defeat stronger vessels.  But even then, sailing around the world plays out like a single-player MMO.  Enemy ships are everywhere, so you must contantly engage in battle to get anywhere.  Ship battles are fun for the most part, but do get reptitive after sinking a couple hundred foes.  But grinding is required if you to obtain enough upgrades to take on legendary ships.\n\nThere are quite a few other activities as well, like hunting and finding misc. collecetibles and treasure.  But the appeal of those diversions eventually wears thin as well.  There are also a few out-of-animus experiences thrown for good measure.  They are so linear, slow, and dull then when given the chance of hacking a computer or jumping off a building, I was dismayed to learn suicide was not actually an option.  Which was unfortunate becuase the hacking mini-game made me want to kill myslef in real life.\n\nSo, I'm debating whether or not to continue my pirate adventure.  I've actually put it away a couple times already, then decided it deserved more of a chance.  I really want to like this game.  It presents a world full of potential.  Unfortunatetly, my voyages in AC IV seem to ultimately ground themelves on the rocks of shallow, glitchy game play and missed opportunity.  So, to save others the same frustrations it gets a thumbs down from me.","December 14, 2013","false","60.7"," 97 of 139 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","97","139","0","6"

At least, certainly my favorite game.\n\nI have never felt so immersed in and compelled by a game in my life. The music, the scenery, the world, the ships; all these combined perfectly to pull me deep into the world of the game.\n\nSHIP COMBAT: 10/10\n\nYou have not felt immersion until you have stood at the wheel of a pirate ship dodging and blasting your way through a five-way naval battle in an intense gale. The ship controls are perfect, and allow you a huge amount of control over the Jackdaw. As soon as I got my ship, I spent days of real time just sailing around fighting, plundering, and upgrading; I can't get enough of it. I have played over 300 hours of this game and the naval combat has never once felt boring or stale; every fight is an adventure (provided you fight the ships in your "weight" class).\n\nI have beaten all the legendary ships. I have upgraded all aspects of my ship to 100% (including the legendary upgrades). I even went on a treasure chest hunt so I could get that special ship's wheel customization I wanted.\n\nAll in all, this is the best sailing/naval combat game in existence (that I've played, at least).\n\n\nNON-SHIP COMBAT: 8/10\n\nYou are rambo. Edward can literally take on the entire crew of a British Man-O'-War singlehandedly and win. The combat is fun and fast, but it's pretty much just a button-masher. If you're looking for an innovative hand-to-hand combat engine, you won't find it here (I'd recommend Shadow of Mordor). Also the game occasionally glitches, meaning you throw someone in the wrong direction, stab the air, etc (this is a rare issue, though). Still, the combat, and especially the boarding sequences (the game transitions seamlessly from naval combat to ship boarding; stereotypical pirate rope swinging included) is exciting and fast-paced, and makes you feel like you're in a less-silly Pirates of the Caribbean film.\n\n\nSTORY: (7/10)\n\nFor a non choice-driven story, this game really delivers. I felt very invested in Edward's character, and I felt that he underwent significant and realistic character development. Many people say they dislike the story because Edward is motivated by greed, but in my opinion those people have missed the point. This story is about a man achieving his dream of wealth, only to realize (SPOILER) too late that love and family are the greatest treasures of them all. I almost cried at the ending (SPOILER ENDS HERE).\n\nFrankly, I would have given the story a higher rating if not for the Assassin and Abstergo portions, which I found to be boring, uncompelling, and repetitive.\n\n\nWORLD: 10/10\n\nI've been to the Caribbean, and I have to say that this game's portrayal of the sea and islands is spot-on. The world is totally open, and the seas positively teem with trade and warships from different colonial powers (which occasionally fight each other) for you to plunder. Also, there are so many beautiful islands to explore that you can spend days of real-time getting through them all. Although the map is, of course, limited, it very rarely feels that way; you feel like the sea is yours to roam.\n\n\nSOUNDTRACK: 9/10\n\nAs a music major, I hear a lot of great music by great composers. This game's music is right up there with those in some places. The music changes a bit too fast for my taste in some places (such as when you're going from naval to shipboard combat), but that's just a matter of personal preference. It's like Pirates of the Caribbean, but different.\n\nMy only true complaint is that, sometimes, some of my crew sing a tad off-key in the sea-shanties. I like the shanties; they are catchy and add to the experience. But to be honest, off-key singing drives me insane. Luckily this isn't the case with all the shanties.\n\n\nOVERALL: 42/50 (84%)\n\nIf you like pirates, buy this game. I would have gladly paid double the price if I had known how good this game was. My rating is not 100% because I feel there are some aspects of the game that could be improved. That being said, I repeat that this is the most fun I have ever had playing a video game.","May 6","true","377.3"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","31","32","0","2"

However, I absolutely loved the game. Although Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag sets much more focus on being a pirate and sailing a ship, it definetely feels awesome to be an assassin pirate.\n\nThere are lots of incentives to upgrade your ship and yourself, and to complete side missions and general activities. The story of Black Flag is definetely one of the best stories I've ever connected to (since the dialogue is almost always matched with the gameplay), and especially near the end you gain a deep understanding of the story.\n\nBut of course, what's a good story without good gameplay? AC4 never dissapoints a pirate's wildest fantasies. I still remember the first time I rammed into a ship and swung onto the ship, wiping everyone out in a fury of pressing two buttons. The combat is rather bland and requires little skill, but feels really cool nevertheless.\n\nIn the end, whether you've played every game in the franchise, have no clue about the games or just wanting to be a badass pirate, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is sure not to dissapoint.\n\n8.8/10\n\nP.S pistol-swords","December 15, 2014","true","55.2"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","34","38","3","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/242050/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Black Flag is a certain success. Certain, but not complete. The best word I have to describe that game is "Inconsistent".\n\nAfter the questionable third volume of the Assassin's Creed franchise, which was supposedly the last in the story... AC IV should have been very brightful with the story, the main character, the combination of all already invented game mechanics and a good addition of newer ones. It was really supposed to add something fascinating to the Assassin's Creed Universe.\n\nUbisoft crafted one of the greatest and interesting games with "Pirates" topic - and some even say "the best pirate game of all". With that they failed to recollect the loose ends of that precious, yet quite dubious Creed of assassins. Speaking ahead, in the next game of the serial, the Rogue, Ubisoft went even forward with messing the cornerstones and adding as much blur to the main AC story as possible. What was intriguing and inspiring at the first and second volumes of franchise, the inheritance of the former race, the main quest to save the world from global apocalypse... all that becomes quite gaudy and messy, t the point when none care about the main quest at all. Oh well, let's cut the story, in the end it just dropped hard and shattered to bits and pieces - spoiling the overall impression even worse than the end of the Mass Effect III.\n\nAs of the Black Flag in general, though... it is normal and even delightful open-world Ubisoft game, with the robbers from the main road posed as valiant knights in their crusade. Only with such goals to fulfill as the thirst for gold and blood and fear, and without the shadow of vengeance for their misdeeds... You may assume now what I'm not so high with pirates as "good guys". Well, I'm not high about the killing in the first place, but that can't stop me from admiring the Assassin's Creed serial for the impact on the gaming world that Ubisoft originally made.\nSo - yeah, with all said, Black Flag is a damn-good gaming experience, with intense action both on the land and on the sea. Great naval battles, the chests with gold and other prizes spread along the big territory of West India... Black Flag is a one fine adventure.\n\nIt has some flaws, sure: the main story and some of the game features quite illogical and even spoiled. Like hunting with the hidden blade - before you acquire one. Like the quests from assassins which you can take right after arriving in the first city - a friggin year before the story actually tells you to do so - and with that, the diving sequences (which would be so natural to free-riding adventurer before he messed with Assassins) comes closer to the end of the gameplot. In my game, I've conquered all the forts, sinked one of the legendary ships, and done about 80% of other free-riding before I was permitted to finally bought the diving bell. It is so messed in my book, that only non-explicit word I have about it is "inconsistent". Yeah, I said that already, I know, I know...\nSome major glitches known from AC III and even previous titles - disappearing ships, leaving big holes into the water, for example. Or people stacking into supposedly solid structures, like walls and roofs. Sometimes during the missions you can try to perform something supposedly legal by game's rules, but not lined into the given quest scripts, like jumping into other bush than you were aimed to... the game crushes. Sweet, right?\n\nWell, with all said, I'm still highly recommend the Black Flag. Even if you're not down with all that Assassin's Creed fuss, that game stands aside. It's a fairytale 'bout pirates, rum, treasures and exceptional bravery of the seamen, with glorious naval battles and very complex (even if a bit unstable) open-world experience.\nMy mark is 8.7/10 - I enjoyed almost everything but the occasional (not frequent) bugs and bits of logical flaws here and there during my gameplay.\n\nPS: As of DLC Freedom Cry - take it, if you have a thing in saving black people from chains (even if gets repetative quite fast). Or if you enjoy the melee combat by AC rules, as there will be new and fine moves with big mean machete. If only there were decapitations in the fighting engine, Adewale would be a perfect resemblance to the "Machete' movie... Blunderbuss is cool thing to wield as well, yarr! Just don't expect from Freedom Cry the deepness even on the level with Revelations. It's just a short DLC campaign for a black assassin, saving his people from slavery. Worth 6.9/10 mark, I guess.","April 8","true","161.5"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","27","31","4","4"

It is strange to think how long it has taken for there to finally be a great pirate game! And I really do emphasise on the word great. Sea exploration, battles and challenges are a wonderful addition to what I considered a pretty flat series. Assassins Creed looked destined to drag out the series with pretty much the same-as-normal routines that you would expect in most of Ubisofts titles, but Black Flag truly surprised me. I was immediately drawn to it when I first heard the inclusion of ships & battle. In fact this reminded me of when Total War finally brought naval battles into the game, I would spend hours enjoying it - just like Black Flag, it brought all those great memories back.\n\nVery refreshing and nice to be able to come back to (first had this on PS4) I'm looking forward to getting round to playing Rogue and Unity to see if Ubisoft has been able to keep up with this excellent title.\n\nPS: As a side note, Uplay is horrendous (as we all know) many times the game did crash, or Uplay decided to Notplay. It definitely became frustrating but overall didn't dampen my Black Flag experience too much.","July 14, 2015","true","51.3"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","31","38","5","0"

If to this we add a compelling plot, well placed in the historical context of reference and fun to follow, the result is a chapter of the saga able, finally, to stand up to the second episode for innovations, the centrality of sea life, and content density. Sorry didn't see the same courage in facing some of the ancestral deficiencies, such as the combat system, weapon anchored again always limits, but the renewed emphasis placed on stealth reminds us that the soul of the Assassin's Creed race much more again on a concealed blade, compared to a sabre in combat.

But I never will and so long as Uplay exists I will never buy another Ubisoft game. I have spend more time trying to get Uplay to work than I have playing the game (and I'm 12% finished with the single-player campaign).\n\nThe world is beautiful and the gameplay is fun. But the game requires Uplay which is a broken pile of steaming... excrement. According to Ubimal, Uplay needs me to set static a static IP for my computer then set up port forwarding for *TWENTY-FOUR* different ports. And if my wife or I want to switch computers (we have two desktops and a laptop that can run AC4 on max settings), then I have to go into the router configuration and change *ALL TWENTY-FOUR* ports to forward to the *other* static IP. And that's *if* Ubisoft connects. I haven't been able to connect yet. I have 70 games in my Steam Library, and I (semi-)regularly play five or more MMOs. I have a 200mbps connection (up and down) that usually sees maximum latency with North American Servers in the range of 100-200ms. The only time I *ever* have trouble connecting to a game is when it requires U(don't)play.\n\nWe almost bought two copies so we could play the multiplayer together (we normally just play MMOs together). I am so glad that I didn't because buying the deluxe version of this game plus all of the DLC only to find that I can't access anything but the basic single-player game is frustrating enough. I would be highly irritated to have blown twice as much only to be locked out. As it is, I am strongly considering demanding a refund for everything except the basic game.

Minor bugs are endless and everywhere. Combat is awful and occasionally will completely stop working and you'll just flick your swords until you either die or resort to your pistols. Shoutout to the GENIUS developer who decided you can only attack when an enemy is highlighted. And then making the highlighting mechanic camera reliant. Btw, the camera is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ too. And don't get me started how it locks when you're being rushed through an underwater current while trying to dodge stone pillars and spikes. Really nice how you can't move the camera to see in front of you. The free-running is equally as horrifying, where you'll run up a wall next to you while facing the camera away from it forever if you don't force him to stop and walk away. Meanwhile running up a fallen tree requires 5 years of training and planning and a runway strip fit for a WW2 bomber. And sometimes he still decides to jump off the ledge next to it or just stop at the base completely. Basically, almost every mechanic seems broken or untested when you play enough. The story is AWFUL and completely unimpressionable. Half the time you have only a vague understanding of what's going on and why you need to be somewhere or doing something.\n\nNow here's my gripe specifically for newcomers to the Assassin's Creed series. Ubisoft's decision to make this an AC game was probably the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ up in the entire game. If you enjoy immersion may want to try somewhere else, cause you play as a guy playing the memory of his pirate ancestor. If you get this I don't need to explain any more, if you don't get it no amount of explaining will help. Moving on.\n\nThe GOOD:\nNaval combat. It's satisfying, it's exciting, and it drives you to upgrade your ship as much as possible, which supplies gameplay. Only downside is how boarding can result in the bugs you get everywhere else (♥♥♥♥ing parkour glitches). Also, the Legendary ships are a teensy bit cheap. One has undamageable sides so you have to hit it from the front, back, or from above with mortar. Another consists of 2 level 75 Man o' Wars that fight you by working together and getting you inbetween them and ripping you apart from both sides (good) but as soon as you kill one the other proceeds to do its best to sit on you, with speeds impossible to match. So basically you have to kill them at the same time, or damn near close to it. But anyways, on sale for $20 the naval combat is planty to make it worth it. Had I bought on full price I'd be taking advantage of Steam's new refund feature.\n\nThe OCD:\nDo you Hate people who Type like this?\nor people who don't capitalize anything that should be like british or captain blackbeard?\nWell whoever wrote up all the text in the game: subtitles, tips, everything, was BOTH of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S in ONE box!!!!! :D","June 9, 2015","false","39.5"," 85 of 136 people (63%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","63","85","136","13","6"

With Assassin's Creed 2 and Brotherhood alike being my all time fave AC titles, I was rather spektical about this at first. The whole idea of how Naval Combat in AC3 was horrible and made me rather avoid this title. But thankfully I took my chances and played this. It is absolutely incredible. Simply amazing.\n\nThe gameplay like previous AC titles is well worked and serves a great time while it follows the same idea of counter killing just about anyone via combat remains classic and at it's finest. Naval combat has been refined in an amazing way that made me simply love it compared to AC3's naval combat.\n\nEdward is a real fun character, altogh he seems like the worst Assassin at first, he appears to have a much better liking than Connor, the story is fun, intresting and all around enjoyable.\n\nMap is huge, no need to explain on that detail. It's big, no other word needed.\n\nLike any other AC games it can have some humerous but only sometimes game breaking glitches, Ubisoft get your head straigth please, Unity just shows how much people can stand your slackering.\n\nPeople tend to hate Uplay, and I actually did at first. But hey it's not THAT horrible, as long as I don't have to use it to actually get in my games so for all I care I just ignore it when the game finally installs.\n\nGreat PC port. Just love it. Solid 60 frames nonstop.\n\nAssassin's Creed IV Black Flag is an amazing title, it serves the idea of a good game for both AC fans and non AC fans. While this may not be your typical 'Loyal to the Creed against the Templar's type of game, it well enough deserves a top spot in the franchise and sits very well with the legacy AC2 holds.\n\nAll in all, I'd give Assassin's Creed Black Flag a 9.7/10 A must have if you enjoy these types of open world games.","December 31, 2014","true","43.8"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","2"

It is the next installment in Assassin's Creed series and a prequel to Assassin's Creed III in terms of storyline.\n\nDesmond Miles is dead, but his legacy continues. An unknown Abstergo Entertainment employee is doing research on Desmond ancestors in the familiar machine called Animus based on Desmond samples where he dives into the history of the one of many fearless and notorious pirates, Edward Kenway.\n\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag like Assassin's Creed III, get some gameplay change and improvements again. Most improvements are very good and makes the game more fun and entertaining. The story takes place before the event of Assassin's Creed III, you play as Edward Kenway, grandfather of Connor Kenway, and a father to Haytham Kenway. In some location in this game, like in the city of Havana, we can go back to the building climbing style of gameplay, while in most location where it's not a city, the tree climbing still present a lot. But the best thing this Assassin's Creed has to offer is sea battles, piracy. While not on mission or on the way to mission location, you can engage and loot Spanish or Her Majesty ships, fleets or convoy and loot them for money and resources. Ship-to-ship battles has been improved a lot in this game that most of the time you will forget the mission and do some piracy instead. Sometimes I wonder how a small Brig can take down 2 big Spanish Galleon without a scratch and live to tell the tale. But those moment are awesome. But that just only one of many new features in this game that you can try. There are other things you can do like hunting sharks, wales or any of those extinct fish, explore undersea shipwreck and gets eaten by sharks, attack and conquer Spanish and/or British coastal forts, or maybe you just want to play checkers here. Sadly the Assassin's Brotherhood feature has been taken out in this game and replaced with Kenway's Fleet new mini-game. But many of these features are great, and there is still more to see.\n\nGraphics of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, for me, I don't know, I don't see much difference with Assassin's Creed III, except the effect on the sea. Sea can be very unpredictable here, sometimes the waves are calm, sometimes you have to face a small tsunami or hurricane which will damage you beloved ship. Performance of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is good, I haven't encounter any bugs or glitch and the game runs smoothly.\n\nIn multiplayer, mictotransactions are back, I don't know why Ubisoft do that, but it's not like you have to buy them, so no harm done here.\n\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, in my opinion, is the second best Assassin's Creed after Assassin's Creed II, ever. I recommend this.\n\nRating 9/10","February 1, 2015","true","62.3"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

The upgrade system is pretty good, you want easy battles, then go hard at finding upgrade material or you don't want find material, then go hard at battles.\n\nCons :\n- Maybe not fully perfect port to PC, some fps drop to 30 may be found.\n- Outside animus gameplay ( every times it on going, I always say "the hell is this, just back to Kenway story !" )\n\nOverall, this is the best AC story & ending (aside from Ezio story). I really do enjoy this game and always trying rush on main story because it just make me curious. Characteristic & enviroment are just so fabulous, and for combat / naval mechanic are awesome.\n\nMaybe this game is underrated (I know some people may feel disgusted with AC series), but just give it a try for this one, may you will fall into the storyline :)\n\n9/10 for it.","March 25","true","41.9"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/recommended/242050/","idiobrando","I DIO!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/","517 products in account","Black Flag is going to be the last Assassin's Creed I buy and I've liked the series since the original (Yeah, I actually like that game). Why you ask? I mean after all I've played more than 50 hours of this game, I clearly didn't hate it. There's a lot to like here, the pirating is fun, especially because there's been barely any good pirate games ever since the remake of Sid Meier's Pirates and that was ten years ago. Edward Kenway is a likable protagonist that doesn't give a crap about ancient aliens brought to you by the History Channel, he just wants the British and Spanish to donate to his retirement fund by giving him all their sugar and rum. It's also a atmospheric game with some nice exploration, finding everything will definitely keep you busy.\n\nThe thing is though is that the game is still plagued with frustrations, that while they don't straight up ruin the game, prevent it from becoming truly great. This mainly comes through the old Assassin's Creed gameplay of platforming and combat. Black Flag is jank as hell when it comes to platforming. Assassin's Creed always had a bit of clunky platforming at times but this is noticeably worse. Coming off of Shadow of Mordor proves this to me even more, Mordor was utterly smooth while in Black Flag it wasn't uncommon for the controls to sh*t themselves causing me to plunge to my death. The combat is also worse than the Ezio trilogy due to the sh*tty camera which was way too zoomed in which allows enemies to cheap shot you off screen. Enemies also have too good priority, being able to see you and hit you before you react sometimes. The future plot is at an absolute nadir here with an obnoxious metaplot that’s far more annoying than Desmond’s stuff ever was and I always thought he was the worst part of the series. (Though I never played 3)\n\nAll this goes to show that Assassin's Creed really isn’t improving and I assume 3 has ruined the series from here on out. But ultimately do I recommend this game? Yes, I do. Despite all the problems it’s a solid sendoff for the series seeing is that Unity and Rogue clearly aren’t helping to prevent the series' downward spiral. It’s definitely worth your time if you’ve liked the series up till this point and/or want a new pirate game.","January 7, 2015","true","59.7"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

So why am I writing this?\nBecause UPlay.\n\nDon't get me wrong: AC4 is probably great. That's why I bought it.\nBut it needs UPlay and here problem begins. I neither need it nor want it, no matter what it offers and whats more important - I simply don't believe it works. And now I have one more reason for it> after you download about 30GB, it needs to connect, you can't immediately play in offline mode. When UPlay doesn't work, you are screwed. If there is a server maintenance, overload, DDOS or just anything wrong, you are screwed.\n\nToday UPlay doesn't work for me (trust me, I tried all the usual stuff as reinstall and so on..) and I know it's not Steams fault and all that is because a thing I don't like, I don't want and I don't use.\n\n\nIt's my fault. I broke my own rule.\nFor a long time I don't buy games, that requires 3rd party stuff. I never had use for them, didn't create even more accounts, avatars or profiles. And I never will. Also I'm an old fart so I remember those days, when if you bought a game, it wasn't "right to use it for period of time on specific service", it was actually _YOURS_.  Thats why I love GOG and Indie developers so much.\n\nSteam is a different story, but it's a sevice that I CHOSE to use. Also I honestly think it tries to improve itself and I get the feeling Valve loves gamers, do not treat them like enemies that must be punished in advance, because "pirates".\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nOf course I won't hate it just for what happened to me. But in order to help you with your decision, all I can say is:  "Please, take a few seconds and think about WHAT and WHO do you support".\n\nNext time I will. Breaking of own rules is stupid, anyway.","December 20, 2014","true","21.9"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","20","26","0","0"

The illusion of choice masking linear gameplay and limited options.

This game is more expansive. There’s more freedom. More sense of accomplishment and I’m just having a good time. It’s polished like all the other games but some of the island scenes are just knock-out beautiful … it’s transportive. I’m loving the sense of exploration, the pirate songs, the layers.\n\nThis game is an incredible accomplishment and I’m glad a gave the franchise another chance.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/242050/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","Yeargh!\n\nI had high expectations for this game after all the positive things I had heard about it. Though I know all too well that sometimes those things that alot of people think is great, to me, are far less so. Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag is... not one of those cases. This game is awesome. Period.\n\nIt helps considerably that Black Flag shakes up the AC series which was in desperate need of something new and fresh. AC2 and ACB were awesome, but ACR added little new and AC3 seemed to have forgotten it was a game series that does killing better than managing a homestead. About the only interesting thing AC3 did was add some naval missions, which was a first for the series and ended up being the highlight of that game for me.\n\nAnd it only got better in Black Flag, as it had better considering this game centers around the "Golden Age of Piracy" in the early 1700's. A time when the Spanish Empire was still strong in the Americas, but the British were fast becoming dominant as well. As usual, you meet a fair number of historical figures here, and this time it's a more colorful cast for obvious reasons. Your main character, Edward Kenway, is a Welsh pirate who, in his desire for wealth and to support a family back home, decides to venture to the Caribbean to seek his fortune. As far as AC protagonists go for me, Edward is a close second to Ezio as being characters that I really like, being much more interesting than his grandson Connor from AC3 ever was.\n\nStory and characters are good here, but it's gameplay that makes this great. Black Flag is, in essence, everything you could ever want in a pirate game. Lots of rum, buried treasure, fights, and, most of all, sailing around in a huge open map able to attack and plunder as you please. As far as sandbox games go, there are two types: the kind that have giant interesting open worlds that I can explore for hours without getting bored (Fallout 3, Skyrim, most of the Saints Row games), and others that end up leading me to just play the main missions because I see little reason to go exploring (Oblivion, Sleeping Dogs, some previous AC games). Black Flag is the former. I spent so much time just wandering about that I had to force myself to do story missions because I would otherwise never finish the game.\n\nOh, and one highlight worth mentioning: money is actually useful in this game. Unlike past AC games where you used cash to do some management thing or improve your house, you need mountains of cash to improve your ship, which only encourages you further to roam the open world causing mayhem. I hope future AC games take this approach because renovating shops or doing trade is at odds with the action gameplay, and using the cash to further the gameplay you actually do is good.\n\nThis game isn't perfect though. The story missions are decent, but too often involve tailing missions where you have to follow some tosser without being spotted. A few are ok, but they seem more common in this game than in past AC games. And compared to the glory that is open world pirate action, following some tosser through the streets of Havana or Kingston is completely uninteresting. I also had a few bugs and one crash, but this is hardly the most unstable game i've ever played. My new monster PC ran this game great on max settings, but for others it may be a different story. Lastly I can do without the hunting and whaling stuff, if only because I don't like killing huggly animals. :(\n\nExcept sharks. ♥♥♥♥ sharks. Also ♥♥♥♥ Uplay for simply existing. And having achievements separate from Steam ones.\n\nAnyways, this game is awesome. It might even be the best AC game i've played. It's certainly comparable to AC2 and ACB. For those who saw the series stagnate after those games, Black Flag is a sign that there is still life in this franchise, and that maybe there are more great games to come from it. We shall see. :o\n\nYeargh...","June 12, 2015","true","56.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

Let me put it to you like this, Black Flag is the best thing to happen to this franchise since II.\nWhy do I like AC IV Black Flag? Well I'll tell ya!\nFirst let's start with the story; Not the game's strong point at all but it is interesting and very thoughtful some times.The story seems to be primarily in the Animus not the real world so I will begin with Edward's story (the animus) then head into the real world protagonist.\nEdward's story has been the most interesting story ♥♥♥ Creed has seen since the Ezio days (Even though I'll admit to not being a fond fan of Ezio, I felt Connor was better than him and Altair in general is my favorite assassin). The story handles all sorts of cool things. It touches up on pirates like Black Beard, Benjamin Hornigold, Calico Jack, and plenty of other cool pirates. One of the best things about the story are the interactions Edward has with other pirates and enemies alike. The story does a good job at displaying the growth Edward has through out the journey and just how much you've done to affect the world he's in, positively and negatively. As for the Templar propaganda and all the cool illusive things about the old ♥♥♥ Creed story lines, they take place outside the Animus; you won't really be finding any cool intrigue in Edward's story though it is a good one.\nAnimus Story; very interesting actually. This one takes place after the death of Desmond and touches up on the many secrets of Abstergo and their new Animus projects. Most of the story here is within secrets, like sticky notes and hacked computers that display little secret conversations and things alike. If you're just following the story and doing none of the side stuff in the real world, it's a shame to say but you're just not playing the full real story. There's juicy stuff here!\nStory Summary: 7.5-10 Pretty good, just not memorable or something new to the franchise.\nNext up, Gameplay. Assassin's Creed Black Flag refined gameplay for AC in general. The game controls and plays the same way as AC III which to some may be a good thing, I for sure liked the controls and free running of III and very much enjoyed the combat system from III which is also returned and refined in Black Flag. The game has a much stronger emphasis on ship combat this time, everything from getting money, to progressing across the world is done on that ♥♥♥♥ing ship. To be honest, the ship battles were fun and interesting in AC III and the earlier parts of this game, it did not have to become a main point seller of the damn game. You can't whipe your ♥♥♥ with out paying 2,000 and having abundant amounts of wood and metal in the ♥♥♥♥ing bathroom so you can whipe your ship's ♥♥♥ too. It is a lot of fun to use the Jackdaw later on when you've pimped it out to near incredible stats. Ship boarding is also a new system in Black Flag, and damn they are fun. Sure they get boring and repetitive, some times tedious, but honestly the rewards you get out of boarding is amazing. Ship combat can become very overwhelming, even when you're OP as ♥♥♥♥. Large ships in a large group can and will ♥♥♥♥ you over, especially in the earlier parts of the game. Most of the Jackdaw's and Edward's upgrades can be unlocked by getting secret blueprints across the caribbean and trust me they are the most annoying things to go out of you way to collect. I also hated hunting in this game, I felt it just restricted me from simply paying for an upgrade. Freaking metal and wood farming for the Jackdaw just ♥♥♥♥ing blows. But there's lots to do in Black Flag too! Assassination contractions have returned from the older AC games and they're rewarding! There's ♥♥♥♥ loads of collectibles and exploration to just be done here. Tonsa fun to be had!\nGameplay: 6-10, it would be higher but the problems I've had were far more daunting than most of the fun I've had. It's sill damn good fun though.\nGraphics are next. Assassin's Creed games have never been ugly games, Black Flag is a wonderful example of the best of last gen graphics. Playing this game on high graphics is just mesmerizing. From the beautiful sky boxes, to the wonderful storm effects, the most wonderful water graphics, environments, and most character models; Black Flag just has plain beautiful graphics. It may lag your computer like monster though!\nGraphics: 9-10, definitely beautiful game.\nSound and Music in Black Flag I feel is just plain forgettable. While the sounds of stuff and ship battles are just jaw droppingly awesome, the thing is most of them are recurring noises from Assassin's Creed III and previous titles. There's not much new to the sound system. As for music? What music? There's music?! AC IV has some great battle tunes and indeed does have wonderful ambient tunes playing around the cities like Kingston and Nassau, but besides those and the wonderful ship shanties; this game has a lack luster soundtrack. Tavern music's also pretty good but just not game saving.\nSound and Music: 4-10, a definite dissappointment from a franchise that has been known for having good music in their games.\nIn conclussion, Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is a must buy for those whom are Asssassin's Creed fans in the like. It's also a perfect game to get into the franchise with because it cuts off most of the old storyline from the previous games and gives gamers a fresh new canvas to enjoy. It is a memorable game in almost every form with most of the gripes I've had with it being forgotten by the time I've finished it. It's just masterful at heart and you can tell Ubisoft was making a game for its fans to enjoy, not for anything else. That's just what they've achieved and it's what makes this game the second best in its franchise.\nOverall Score: 8.5-10, must play and a definite pick up!\n","July 16, 2015","true","151.3"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

Honestly, I can now easily assort this as one of my biggest errors I have ever done.\n\n(I have't played any previous AC games)\n\nAssassin's Creed IV Black Flag game, first of all I should point out that it is very intelligent game with complex and thrilling story and interesting characters, smart dialogues and amazing scenes. The whole game is based on the historical facts, so it's educative as hell too.\nThe open world in this game is realistic and fun. Graphics and the game's design is perfect. I like the balance between the main story and side missions. The game gives you as much space as you want in the way how you want to proceed. The game's soundtrack is brilliant and feelingful aswell as the voice over which makes an irreplaceable atmosphere in this game. The main characters, pirates, are unique and definitely not boring. You will find nothing like wooden leg, parrots or eyepatch here. They are really well written characters.\n\n\nI would recommend Black Flag to anyone who likes action adventure games and ignored AC series, even to those who hate pirates, because this game illustrates them just the way they should be, I know it's still very romantic kind of way to look on them, but what the hell.\n\n10/10","December 11, 2015","true","102.3"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","15","20","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonex90/recommended/242050/","jonex90","J o n e x","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonex90/","977 products in account","“Absolutely breathtaking” is a very good way of describing Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, from my experience at least. I’m very happy that Ubisoft decided to go back in time to a very interesting period in history, the Golden Age of Piracy. Not only does this game visit a stunning Caribbean setting, but there are also numerous enhancements to the gameplay and graphics. I’ve put about 30 hours into it so far and I’m 60% towards total completion.\n\nIn Black Flag, you can sail your own pirate ship, and explore a vast Caribbean sandbox consisting of uncharted islands, shipwrecks, and 3 major cities. There’s a vast open ocean to travel across, but the new convenient fast travel system has eliminated the annoyances of fast travel in the previous games (such as finding a fast travel point in order to fast travel). Now after discovering a location, you can quickly travel there at any time you wish.\n\nEach of the cities is different in its style and residents. Visiting each of them gave me the feeling that I was visiting a different part of the world. Havana has the Spanish theme, Kingston has the English theme, and Nassau has the Pirate theme. I was very impressed with the amount of detail put into each location. And this can be said for the more remote areas such as the jungles and beaches. A lot of work was put into making the environments feel genuine.\n\nThe gameplay has been slightly improved since Assassin’s Creed III. There are many new tools to use (some are REALLY neat), and new animations for fighting sequences. The enemies feel more dangerous than they did in previous games, which are good because I always found the combat to be a little too easy :P Black Flag has made sure to keep the fights challenging.\n\nThe graphics are another point worth mentioning. The Anvil-Next engine looks even better than it did in Assassin’s Creed III, which is to be expected, but it went above my expectations. The new weather system features full night and day cycles, complete with the most intense storms I’ve ever seen in games. Nvidia users get the full experience, with TXAA anti-aliasing and improved PhysX, though Radeon users still have a great looking game!\n\nA big reason I bought this game was because of the story, which is AAA quality as usual. The Templar twist in Assassin’s Creed III still beats anything that Black Flag has thrown at me, but that doesn't mean I’m disappointed. There are many famous pirates that some history buffs will go crazy over. Your character Edward has one hell of a journey turning from pirate to Assassin and even plays a Templar for a while. It’s very well thought out, with real events being tied into fictional events, part of the Assassin’s Creed universe.\n\nThere’s so much more for me to talk about, but if anyone has made it this far, you’ll probably be sick of this fan boy rant. If you enjoy the series, you won’t need this review. If you’re unsure, I would take a risk and buy it. There’s so much to do, and a great story to boot.\n","November 30, 2013","true","53.9"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","30","48","0","0"

Connor.  But our newest unknown main character a research assistant for abstergo entertainment seems to have some unknown potential.  But enough about him our true main character Edward Kenway a man who wanted to hold the world hostage and take what was owed to him or so he thought and became a pirate and lived by the pirate code and unwittingly lived by the iconic assassin's code: Nothing is true; everything is permitted.  Edward does start off a little lackluster and takes you awhile to get into his character and the many flaws he does have.  (spoiler)  Not being a true assassin or even joining order at the end of the game. I knew he had joined at the end but felt like it wasn't a strong revelation for him to join.   The story was strong in spots and weak in others and felt a little jumpy from certain missions to the next mission.  Towards the end of the game they mentioned its been six years and you are like wow really.  One of the downsides of the game is how Ubisofts loves adding those treasure chest and the run after an item like almanac sheets in the third and now music sheets and animus fragments.  I personally am bored with because all the games have had something along these lines but the plus side no feathers in this game. Same way with the fighting mechanics you basically just spam the same  button combinations over and over eventually I would like to see a combo fighting style installed in the games to keep it fresh.  The open world/sea was a amazing you will spend hours raiding ships.  Till the awe factor wears off and I mean hours because it was fantastic and the world was so huge.  If you didn't have the fast travel it would take you days (over exaggeration) to get from one location to another.  The naval part was one of the prizewinning features of this video game it was grand.  Legendary ship battles will have you shouting for joy once you defeat these monstrous ships.  Now the other downside to Assassin's Creed: Black Flag was the every so often how you would find the hole in the world and just free falling to your death.  The climb your ship from the sea and just fall through and be stuck or the gaming loading and you and your crew fall in a big empty ocean where your ship should be.  And the occasional graphic glitch where you need to exit the game completely and start again.  These were more annoying then anything on just how random they were.  All and all AC4: Black Flag was a excellent game and as a huge fan of the series I do recommend this game even though the gameplay and style hasn't changed much since brotherhood.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/reviewboard","March 2, 2014","true","158.3"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","30","48","0","1"

First you don't just randomly start climbing a wall when running. It feels very smooth and clean but a notorious run up a wall and jump off that is terrible.\n\nCombat: The combat is relatively easy unless you come across an officer or heavy soldiers. These special soldiers can parry and counter attack. The two swords make the fighting very interesting with some bad ♥♥♥ animations. The pistols are slightly unrealistic because when you reload it does the normal reloading animation then does the same animation 2-4 times depending on how many pistols you carry. The pistols have great variety and are made for every players needs.\n\nCombat Extended: One of the weapons you come across is the blow gun, it can shoot 2 profectiles, a sleep dart(Knocks them out for a period of time) and a Beserk Dart(It makes the victim start attacking others. You also have an array of odd weapons. Such as the throwing knife(Self Explanatory) and the Rope Dart. The Rope Dart can be used to hang or pull soldiers to you, I didnt use these much but when I did they were extremely useful. You also have two hidden blades.\n\nGadgets: Some of the gadgets or items you get include the: Smoke Bomb and Money. The smoke bomb stun and blind soldiers whilst the gold draws civilians with means you can blend in.\n\nShip Gameplay: The ship gameplay is acclaimed and overall extremely fun and diverse. The weapons you have include the: Mortar(A long range upward firing cannon that shoots a shell that explodes over the target spewing it with cannon balls.), The Chain Shots(Used to fire at sails and slow ships), Round shot(Normal Cannon shot) Heavy shot(A flaming cannonball of close ranged death) and the swivels(After you make a solid hit against the the solid part of the ship, it leaves weakpoints that the swivels fire at dealing massive damage). After you decapicate a ship you can board it and have to kill crew and/or cut a flag and/or kill a captain and scouts. After doing this you can repair your ship the Jackdaw or send it to your fleet, you can also lower your wanted level(If your wanted level is high enough pirate hunters come after you.).\n\nThere is also assassin contracts which involve killing a target, bonus for remaining stealth, Naval contracts which you hunt down ships. You can also save pirates and unlock taverns.\n\nStory: The story is brilliant, there is character development is solid as titanium, and the story in general is SIMPLY BRILLIANT. Nope, no spoilers.\n\nIn conclusion this game is the best in the franchise.\n\n","February 16, 2015","true","441.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

Aside because I want to finish because witcher 3 is incoming, the game itself is kind of stray from the line of the creed.\n\nTo wrap the story , it's about a man that dreams big about adventure and get rich fast so he sail to the sea to become pirate while leaving his beautiful wife behind. All to find the plundering as a pirate that he was doing is wrong and he lost his way. At the end, the Assassin's Creed made him realise that he was wrong and help him back to his way, and don't forgot his daughter come to meet him so he really realise that he's wrong and try to become a good father. Happy End\n\nIt's better to name this game a different title, the story is not about Assassin's Creed at all. It's about pirate and plundering, while adventuring meet the Assassin's Creed and Templar.\n\nWhile I complain about the story and the concept, the gameplay itself is fantastic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/242050/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","After what is generally considered one of the lesser points of the Assassin's Creed franchise, Ubisoft put out yet another installment, taking the pirate theme and more or less perfecting it. Few other games have taken the pirate theme and done so well with it. Black Flag blends the concept of being a pirate, exploring the ocean and visiting islands quite well.\n\nIn Black Flag, you take on the role of Edward Kenway, who is trying to make a life for himself and his family back home. He joins a privateering crew and one night at sea during a storm his ship comes across another that happens to have an Assassin on board. Things goes awry and Edward finds himself washed up on the shore of an island...next to the Assassin who killed some of his crew members. After getting revenge Edward plunders the Assassin's gear and begins masquerading as an Assassin. Deciding to meet up with the party who wished to meet the Assassin (found out via a note in his gear), Edward soon finds a ship to replace the one he lost. Ubisoft found an intersting way to turn our hero into an Assassin, although at some points it feels a bit off. A bit later in the game, Edward is asked to display the skills he's learned during his time with the Assassins, and Edward performs every action, every takedown with extreme ease, no explanation, and no backstory. Understandably though, this is used as a very light tutorial for your basic actions.\n\nThe plot is your usual Assassins versus Templars fare, and this time both sides are after what is called the Observatory. The interesting thing is Edward doesn't care about either side, even though he is technically playing for the Assassins. Instead, he wants to find the Observatory for himself and become a wealthy man, and throughout the game he plays both sides to get whatever information he can to get him closer to his goal. Edward’s personality and the game’s theme makes the story an interesting one, and it’s backed up with fascinating supporting characters that include famous pirates like Blackbeard (Edward Thatch) and James Kidd. The sci-fi elements still remain. Abstergo are featured in the present time, as the player is put into the role of an employee working at Abstergo Entertainment, who is currently testing a pirate themed game for the company. These moments out of the animus feel lacklustre compared to the amazing world that Ubisoft has created in Black Flag.\n\nThe game has an open-world feel to it, although it is not as large as most open-world games. You are pretty much free to explore as you wish, uncovering collectibles, finding hidden chests, pickpocketing citizens of one of the three major cities, as well as sailing around from island to island finding out what lies in store for you on each one. You can hunt wild game, which rewards you with materials to upgrade various things (much like Far Cry 3), such as weapon holsters to carry more weapons, or a bigger ammo pouch to carry more bullets for your gun. There are also many different outfits to customize your look.\n\nThere is so much to do in Black Flag, that at times is can be a bit overwhelming. There are the standard vantage points from the previous games, where climbing to the top reveals large portions of the map, but there are a few new things. There are Forts that guard costal area, which can be taken over to reveal coastal sections of the map. There are also plantations which you can sneak into to steal goods, or Mayan puzzle pieces to collect that lead to treasure. The map is scattered about with some hidden and not-so-hidden treasure chests which house a variety of random loot, much of which just serves to line your wallet with currency. Currency is then used to buy upgraded swords, cutlasses, pistols, and so on.\n\nWhile participating in the game’s story missions, the game uses the same mechanics that we have seen  since the original Assassin's Creed. Following a target, and eavesdropping on their conversation to progress the campaign. There’s a voting system at the end of every mission, which is a brilliant way of Ubisoft implementing a feedback device for players, while blending it into the game’s plot through the Abstergo storyline. My only gripe is that it does not show what anyone else has voted, but instead thanks you for sharing your feedback. Combat is still easy, using a system akin to the Batman Arkham series, relying on careful timing, counterattacks, and chaining basic attacks together. As you master the system you will see just how flashy combat is, as you are then able to move between opponents in a whirlwind of steel and death, increasing the body count as you go. Even though you can kick everyone's butt if you so choose, there are times when it's simply not a good idea. Sometimes the numbers against you can be too great, especially as you are first learning the combat system. Portions of the game rely on stealth, and even when you are not forced to use stealth, it's always a great tool to weaken the forces pitted against you. You can hide in brush while whistling to draw your prey towards for a silent takedown, hiding their body in the brush afterwards as you continue onward towards your objective. And there are always plenty of places to hide and get the upper hand!\n\nBlack Flag looks absolutely fantastic, with some thirst-inducing ocean and wave effects that are some of the best generated in a video game. The world looks equally amazing, with tons of detail going into making a believable incarnation of the West Indies. The animation can be a bit off, but apart from that it’s a very pretty game.\n\nAssassin's Creed is one of those games thats difficult to write a review for within a character limit. There's simply too much to tell about, from the 25+ hour campaign, to the multiplayer, to the insane amount of collectible and side activites, and the many exotic island locations which you may find yourself. Ubisoft has crafted possibly the best pirate game ever, and it is definitely a worthy addition to the Assassin's Creed franchise, and dare I say on par with the masterful Assassin's Creed II, possibly taking it's spot as the best game in the series. Ubisoft has fully addressed nearly all o fthe issues with the previous installments and added so much more on top of that. My hat's off to you Ubisoft....this time.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=387598899\n\nA Must Play\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","February 5, 2015","true","34.1"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","1"

Rarely do those games come from AAA developers, but Assassin's Creed 4 most certainly delivered. Between responsive controls, fun game mechanics, a massive world to explore, and an exciting story, I enjoyed nearly every minute of this game. Though parts of the story do leave a bit to be desired, and I was left with some unanswered questions at the end. Maybe it's due to my lowered expectations after AC3, or maybe it's because I'm a sucker for pirate adventures and sea shanties, but the latest installment of the Assassin's Creed series just may be my new favorite.\n\nControls\nBasics – The basic game controls are more or less the same as they've always been: Run around, jump and climb buildings and stab lots of enemies. The familiar control scheme is satisfyingly responsive and though there were occurrences of Edward doing something I didn’t intend, they were seldom. Most impressive, however, is the input detection. I generally play Assassin’s Creed games with an Xbox controller, since they don’t require the precision of a mouse and allow for more fluid movement with the analog sticks. But if I wanted to switch to the mouse and keyboard (for instance, to more quickly navigate menus), all I had to do was press a key or move the mouse and input automatically switched over. When I want to switch back I pick up the controller again and can keep playing. I didn’t even have to enter the settings menu.\nCombat – Combat is incredibly satisfying, if extremely simple and easy, allowing you to either mash a single button until everyone's dead, or pull of some fun and impressive-looking combos with your swords and pistols.\nThe Jackdaw – Similar to AC3, you have some control over the ship's speed, allowing you to make tighter turns if necessary. The ship does control rather sluggishly, but that's to be expected considering, well, it's a ship, and it's actually a good bit more responsive than what I imagine steering a real boat is like. Naval combat is fairly straightforward, allowing you to select from a myriad of weaponry for different scenarios. Use the broadside cannons to hit anything alongside you, the chain-ball shooting chase cannons to hit enemies in front, or launch fire barrels off the back of your ship to hit those behind you. You can also upgrade the ship with new weapons like mortars and heavy shot for even more range and damage.\n\nMechanics\nThe World – The game world is absolutely massive, with tons of areas to explore and things to collect. And aside from a few story-critical areas, the entire map is open to you from the moment you get your ship, meaning if you want to ignore the story missions entirely and explore everything, nothing’s stopping you. Of course many areas of the map are far more dangerous than the starting areas, but a nice upgrade system lets you plunder enemy ships for materials which you can then use to make your own ship stronger.\nForts – The map is divided up into sections, with each section being home to a large fort, or “base.” If you’re able to destroy the fort and kill the fort leader, the fort is then liberated, opening up that section of the map to you. This reveals locations and hunting areas for that section of the map, as well as opens up some naval missions that you can complete for some extra cash.\nKenway’s Fleet – After you get a good ways into the story, you gain control of your very own fleet. From that point, any enemy ship you plunder gives you the option to send it to your fleet. Once there, you can send the ships on mini-missions similar to assassin missions from Brotherhood, trading goods for money. By completing these missions, you unlock new trade routes with new missions that can net you even more money. However, some routes are more dangerous than others, and you have to first send some of your fleet into a mini-battle to make it safer for travel. While overall a pretty small part of the game, the fleet missions can be interesting, and are certainly a good way to bring in some extra cash.\nTailing and Tagging – Quite a few missions throughout the game involve following a target for a distance without letting them spot you. This usually involves walking at a distance behind them, and ducking into alleys or blending in with groups of people to avoid detecting. Black Flag also introduces a new mechanic that allows you to “tag” up to ten enemies by focusing on them in eagle vision. They are then highlighted when you return to your normal view, and you can follow them even as they walk behind buildings or you would otherwise normally be unable to see them. While a neat mechanic, it does seem to make many tailing missions almost too easy.\n\nGraphics\nTo be blunt and to the point, the game looks gorgeous, both aesthetically and graphically. Some of the most enjoyable parts for me were just sailing over the deep blue waters, passing by other boats and islands. The texture resolutions are certainly impressive, and there were only a few times (generally during close-ups) when a noticeably low-res texture jumped out at me. With the recent addition of PhysX capabilities, smoke rising from fires and recently fired cannons also behaves much more realistically. And everything ran surprisingly smoothly, too. I’d heard some reports of poor optimization and consistently low framerates and was initially worried, but I was able to set the game settings at near maximum with next to no problems at all, only some slowdown during ship battles when there was a lot of smoke. And considering I’m running off a GTX480 I consider that to be pretty impressive.\n\nStory\nEdward Kenway – To avoid the risk of spoilers I won’t detail too much here, but I did find the game’s story very enjoyable. The characters are solid and there’s certainly no lack of personality to be found. Edward is of course a pirate, so everything he does is with his own and his crew’s best interest in mind, but that doesn’t stop him from being able to care about others, and as the story progresses Edward really grows as a character, one of my favorite aspects of AC2. I did however have some issues with the finale, as the story ended with a relatively important task left incomplete and with a few overhanging questions that were never answered, which made for a slightly less than satisfying conclusion.\nThe Employee – Meanwhile, outside the Animus, you play as a new employee to Abstergo Entertainment, a company aiming to bring the memories and experiences of people such as Edward to the general public in the form of interactive movies. Unlike the previous games’ arcs with Desmond, your character in Black Flag is faceless and voiceless, and you play from a first-person perspective, restricted to your office building throughout the game. It’s certainly an interesting spin on both the purpose of the Animus technology and the real-world portions of the game, and not entirely unwelcome in my opinion since Desmond’s story, while interesting, seemd to almost competed for dominance with Ezio’s story at times. Now your time spent outside of the Animus generally involves talking with your superiors, and later on learning to hack your co-workers computers for some very interesting backstory.\n\nThe Verdict\nOverall this is certainly one of the most fun games I’ve played recently, and one of the few that I actually had a hard time putting down. It looks beautiful, plays well and is responsive, has an interesting story and overall some really fun mechanics. Despite a few flaws with the story that left questions hanging in my mind, I enjoyed the majority of the time I spent with it, and can say that this is a huge step up from the previous game.","February 24, 2014","true","87.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

I just recently started playing Black Flag and after the horrible, slow and boring ACIII this was just a breath of fresh air, even if it took many, many elements from the other AC games. But they also managed to improve on the more mediocre aspects this time, making it a solid game all around, and my favorite Assassin's Creed game since Brotherhood (which now comes second place).\n\nAfter some tweaking this game runs wonderful, at a solid 60fps. This game is just gorgeous. Man, rarely have I witnessed such a beautiful game. The water, the islands, the details. You have to see it in motion to truly appreciate it. Some of the faces, on the other hand, still need some work. Graphically speaking these are still the weakest, just like all the previous AC games.\n\nI think anyone has played an AC game before so they need no explanation as far as gameplay is concerned. There have been some changes this time, in a positive way. First, there's the sea, it's open for exploration right from the beginning (some (side) missions have to be unlocked first though, like diving). And second, the Abstergo/real life missions are short, which is a big improvement (I'd still like to see it entirely removed, however).\n\nBlack Flag is a huge game. Completing the story will take roughly 20-25 hours I think and doing literally everything can take anywhere between 75-100 hours. It is that big. And it's all very fun to do as well, partially thanks to the sunny setting which absolutely brightened my mood on dark, cloudy days. I wish I had the time to 100% it but my priorities are a bit different in comparison to most of the other gamers out there (I like to finish as many games as possible).\n\nAssassin's Creed IV Black Flag is back after the mediocre ACIII and it's bigger and better than ever. I thought I was done with the franchise after the last couple of games but if Unity can even match this one I'll gladly take back those words.\n\n[Rating: 94/100]","May 30, 2014","true","29.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","1"

Ubisoft have shown that the Assassin's series is far from running out of ideas as this installment, for me, is easily the most enjoyable and rewarding of them all.\n\nEdward Kenway, a man who is still uncertain of just what kind of man he is, takes up life on the sea in hope to one day be able to live a comfortable and easy life. His ambitions extend to as far as a coin can shimmer and no further. This story isn't one about conspiracy theories or attempts to save the world. It's a personal story of identity, purpose and self realisation that many, including myself, can very much relate to. What truly matters to a man and a woman.\n\nThe characrers are easily what make this game so memorable. Each rough pirate and posh kingsman brings with them an equally vast and rich personality that you'll either love to love or love to hate. The voice acting is absolutely incredible and some scenes hold some truly gripping speeches.\n\nManaging to play this on ultra, the game is gorgeous. When you first take control of Edward and you sea the deep blue of the ocean, the lush green vegetation and the warm glow of the sands, it's hard to not take a minute and just observe everything around you. Even free running and chase segments in the jungle, I found myself just admiring the level desging so much.\n\nThe music is yet another immersive feature to this game that a great deal of attention has been obviously applied to. The tavern music brings life to the towns you visit and the shanties sang as you explore the west indies makes you feel you're on an adventure for riches.\n\nI think the biggest attraction gameplay wise for most people has to be the naval combat. I personally love pirate games already and found the combat to be fast, intense and very enjoyable. The moment you incap a ship and call your crew to ready to board never gets old! There is enough freedom for you to play as you want. either defensively with fire barrels, up close with heavy shot, or snipe them with mortar fire. As with other Creed games, Black Flag has a A LOT of other activities to take part in, optional lands and towns to explore and mysteries to uncover! If you have an eye for adventure you'll feel right at home on the Jackdaw!\n\nMy only problem is that the game is still restricted to the idea you're reliving memories and as such, the 'animus' prevents you from going to certain places at certain times becase "It wasn't available in this sequence" or it'd take you out of the experience of the 1700's to run around in a modern day office doing chores for people you don't know and don't bother questioning why. While Ubisoft DID do a good job in limiting both those things to a minimum, it was still something that didn't need to be there and restricted the experience, for me at least.\n\nBlack Flag is a very rich game in character, content and reasons to play. If you want to get lost in the oceans and adventure or be a part of a grand story with grander characters then be sure to pick this gem up!","January 5, 2014","true","37.6"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Yet here I am... with riches and reputation, feeling no wiser than when I left home."\nIf I could, I'd give this game one thumb up, and one thumb down. But for this review, I thought to myself, what would I say if a friend asked me if he or she should buy this game?\n\nFirst off, I'm not gonna be like these other reviewers downvoting instead of not recommending because of a problem they had with Uplay. I've played the game and finished it, and put alot of time into this game, therefore I am actually gonna talk about the game, and discussing about what Ubisoft did right and wrong.\n\nThe Review\n\nIt's definetly the most unique Assassin's Creed game out there. It shares a few elements from the other ones, but makes its own mark with its setting... 18th century Carribean. The gameplay is incredibly easy. All the enemy types are the same, and even though the animations are well done, they get boring to look at pretty quickly. Enemy AI is also pretty bad. Sometimes an enemy will see you, and then all of a sudden go back to patrolling. This is franchise has one of the easiest stealth systems ever, and Black Flag shares that curse. Enemies can't hear you running, enemies can't see you clearly sometimes, enemies walk across dead bodies sometimes, the list goes on. It's surprising that after five games, not even counting the PS Vita and PSP version, they can't add a simple little crouch button that games in 2004 had. Scaling also feels dumbed down and much easier. There's nothing special about it anymore, and there's a lack of interesting buildings.\n\nNow... being a captain of a ship. Something an Assassin's Creed game has never aimed at. It's got it's share of good and bad. The good? Steering feels immersive. The atmosphere of captaining your own ship, and having a loyal crew of members working for you that all want the same thing. It's done well. Everyone's happy, having fun, but always ready to follow orders. Ship battles are also fun, but there's no real strategy involved. Jumping on to the enemy ship never gets old too in my opinion. There's no better feeling than "I've disabled you ship, now I'm gonna jump on, kill your crew members, and force you to lower my bounty level!". Hunting whales, dolphins, and sharks is cool the first few times you do it, but it gets boring after a while and doesn't feel too useful. Same with diving missions, it's cool at first and actually has it's own little stealth system, but feels useless. The world is also HUGE! But... the islands are small, and there was never any feeling that I ever wanted to explore any of them unless they had a collectible that I wanted at the time. There's only four islands that have full cities, the rest are either for trading or they're empty.\n\nEdward is also probably the most unique character out of all the previous Assassins. The previous Assassins wanted Revenge, Freedom, Justice, Answers. Heroic type things like that. Edward? He wants to become rich and famous, which is fitting for the setting. His character model is also super badass. But despite all of this, he's not that interesting of a character. Bad thing's in his life happen, but somehow the player never really feels for him (except for maybe in the end). The story start's out right in the action, which is nice, but after that it sort of starts to lose its meaning. Of course, there's also the story that goes on in the modern day. I don't have many good things to say about it. It's unwanted and unnecessary. It's like immigration: an incredible boring and long process that you don't want to do, but it needs to be done for you to progress. Even though I'm not saying alot of good things about the story, don't get me wrong. It has it's moments that I wouldn't want to spoil for you, but it's taken over by too much bad.\n\nGraphics and sound aren't too special in this game. Facial animations aren't the best, and the lighting isn't too great either. The resolution for texture's aren't that low, but they aren't very high for you to be amazed either. Voice acting is good, but the quality of all the other sound's are average, some even subpar. There's also some bugs. I didn't deal with too many, but I dealt with enough where I have to inform it. Nothing gamebreaking though. And no, I had no problems with Uplay.\n\nOverall Opinion\n\nAssassin's Creed 4: Black Flag doesn't do much to impress. Here and there, it's got some good things, and it captures the pirate aesthetic, but it's overtaken by a boring storyline, easy gameplay, a few bugs, some "meh" sounds and graphics, and there's really not much to do in the world.\n\nFinal Recommendation\n\nIf you are thinking of buying this game, only buy it when it's on sale, or find a good price and buy it for the cheapest price you can find.","January 6","false","97.9"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","19","30","2","2"

Developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft.\n\nAssassins Creed 4 has surprised me with how the game starts off. It begins with a good build up to your character and then you find yourself beached on a shore with a fellow sailor and then chasing after him.\n\nWhen I first started playing the game I was very surprised on how it started off with pirating and adventuring. After a bit of playing the game started to feel like Assassins Creed with the climbing up a tall tower to sync you to your surroundings.\n\nEventually I got to get my own ship and sail the seas. Finding small little islands and other larger islands to explore for treasure chests, messages in bottles and treasure maps. You also get to chase after sea chanty songs for your crew to sing as your sailing. Other artifacts like Aztec monuments you climb and get to orientate a marker with your surrounding to find where the buried artifact will be is a cool idea in the game. This all makes this game a joy to play and a break away form the old flag hunting that is meaningless.\n\nThe game play is the same as previous Assassin Creed games with the climbing and combat style. I like that you can run up to a person and assassinate them, get into tavern fights to open the tavern up to you.\n\nThere are places in town when you first begin where you need to save some pirates from the authorities who later join you and are your crew on ship. You also get to save people adrift on the seas and they become crew members.\n\nOnce you upgrade your ship to include harpoons you will be able to go whaling and get that big white whale! Along with whaling you can go shark hunting as well.\n\nEventually you will get to a point in the game where you will get control of your own island and call it home. Upgrading it to provide a tavern, shop, ship repair store and an estate home as well.\n\nThis game was played with an Xbox360 controller and I can say that its really made to accommodate this type of game play. I appreciate it when developers make a game compatible with a controller.\n\nI am very impressed with Assassins Creed IV Black Flag and happy that I picked up the Deluxe Gold Edition for $30 during the 2014 Summer Sale.\n\nIf your planning to buy this game or not sure if you want to play another Assassins Creed game I would recommend this game, check out the video below.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/howiegaming/recommended/242050/","howiegaming","Howie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/howiegaming/","410 products in account","To me, The Golden Age of Piracy is perhaps one of the most intriguing times in history, and this is exactly where the latest Assassin’s Creed takes us. Many feared what yearly entries would do to the franchise, but with the setting in the early 18th century Caribbean, the improvements to gameplay, and the leap to the next-gen consoles, this is probably the best version of the best Assassin’s Creed yet.\n\nIn Black Flag, the Caribbean is yours for the taking, and it doesn’t take long before the game sets you loose on the world with your own ship, your own crew, and an enormous amount of things to find and do. Gone are the days of the naval portions being cordoned off from the rest of the game. In fact, you’ll spend the majority of your time on ship this time around, but if you want to scour that small island off to the starboard side for loot, you just need to drop anchor and make the short swim to shore.\n\nThis easy and abundant gameplay makes getting distracted in Assassin’s Creed IV a very common occurrence. I found myself stopping and plundering every small island, boarding every ship, and exploring every undersea wreck. Many things are not available right up front, or you are just too weak to take them on, but the game’s progression feels very natural, and I never felt like I was locked out of doing too much at any given time. In fact, if I was able to do even more earlier on, I would have never gotten this review done.\n\n\nThe story in Black Flag is one of the most interesting me, simply because of Edward’s rogue dynamic. Edward is not an Assassin. He stumbles into the conflict between the Assassins and Templars purely by chance while seeking riches to provide a better life for his estranged bride. He is a pirate. The growth and evolution of Edward and his external view of the conflict was a much more interesting story to me than the fairly static “creed locked” nature of the previous games’ heroes. The modern day aspect is also quite interesting and I did not dread being put outside of the Animus as much as I did in previous games. There are also a couple of interesting Easter Eggs connecting the world of Assassin’s Creed to Ubisoft’s upcoming Watch Dogs as well as possible hints at future entries in the Assassin’s Creed series.\n\nThe free running through the world feels improved over Assassin’s Creed III, and while I did run into a few areas of frustration and difficulty climbing, these were much fewer and farther between than I was used to. Anyone who has played the past games knows the issues of running up a wall only to grab onto nothing or jumping out into open air instead grabbing onto a ledge. This being my biggest downside of any Assassin’s Creed game, I was very happy to find that the free running and climbing in Black Flag feels a lot more intelligent to what you are actually trying to accomplish.\n\nBeing that it is such a primary focus, the naval portion of the game has been much improved over your time at the helm in Assassin’s Creed III. Dynamic weather can affect your ocean voyages as sudden storms attempt to topple you, fog limits visibility, and waterspouts damage your ship.\n\nThe Caribbean seems extremely alive with a vibrant and varied world that feels much more organic and real than any Assassin’s Creed before. Being a free roaming pirate in this world is incredibly freeing and the only time I got any feelings of redundancy was actually during the Assassin focused missions. While being a pirate is extremely fun and open, playing the Assassin is the exact opposite. I felt limited while slinking around in foliage and tailing enemies without being seen. These may be staples of the Assassin’s Creed series but they have not evolved in the same way as the rest of the gameplay. Fortunately these sections play a much smaller part in Black Flag so they do not overshadow the awesome feeling of being a pirate.\n\n\n\nCollectibles are not a grind in Assassin’s Creed IV as they seemed to be in prior games. Money and supplies to upgrade your gear and ship are found by hunting the wildlife of the Caribbean and plundering the various ships found out on the open sea. Setting out in a creaky rowboat to take on a killer whale or a great white shark is just another daily occurrence for the times, and boarding a ship twice the size of yours to steal its contents is a necessary means for survival and fortune, but all of it remains fun throughout as there is so much to do that no one specific thing gets to feel too repeated.\n\nFor those not familiar with the multiplayer, it consists of numerous game modes that involve hunting targets stealthily. The more stealth and discretion that you use, the more points you will be awarded. The execution is done wonderfully, but the online mode is largely the same as the multiplayer that we’ve seen before. While massive focus was put into overhauling the way the single player game was played, multiplayer was slapped with a few minor updates and a facelift for the environments and characters. The lack of change isn’t a bad thing as I feel that Assassin’s Creed has one of the most unique and fun multiplayer modes on the market, but don’t expect to be floored by the multiplayer in the same way that the campaign will get you.\n\n\n\nEven though it is cross generation, Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is one of the must have launch games for the next generation of consoles (and PC!) and should hold you over with its vast world until the next slew of next-gen titles hits the market. Ubisoft have proven that they are not milking the Assassin’s Creed franchise for all it’s worth as much as they are cultivating the great things about the series to continue to bring us amazing and fun games. This impressive interpretation of a pirate’s life mixed with the Assassin and Templar influence was a thrill ride that will surely be hard to beat in the inevitable next entry in the franchise.\n\n\nPositive things.\n\nThe Golden Age of Piracy.\nSo many things to see and do around the world...\n...and a massive vibrant world to contain all these things.\nFree running feels improved.\nBeautiful visuals.\nBeing a pirate, in every way.\n\nNegative things.\n\nTailing targets and remaining unseen gets repetitive.\nThe freedom of the pirate makes the Assassin feel limited.\nToo many distractions can mean you take too long to finish a review.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n\n9.5/10","November 26, 2013","true","120.4"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","20","32","0","3"

The only way to get such thing is by becoming a pirate ... Arrrr?\n\nSTORY:  The story revolves around Edward Kenway and his quest to become a mighty pirate in the Caribbean. He meets the mysterious order of the Assassins which he decides to abandon. The story has some emotional parts but overall, it's rather disappointing. The Assassins plot seems forced and a bit out of place. If this game was called "Pirates" or something it would've been better, since the AC plot is so forced.\n\nGAMEPLAY:  Standard Assassin's Creed fare, you jump, hide, kill, run around rooftops, and most annoyingly: eavesdrop. Once you board your ship, the Jackdaw, all of that changes. The naval combat and the huge open sea and world make up for monotonous on foot missions. While the naval combat draws so much from the Playstation 2 game: Sly 3 Honor Among Thieves, it is still fun and innovative in its own way. To sail around the Caribbean and sink other ships while your shipmates are singing is a sight to behold.\nOh and the game has a SH!T ton of collectibles.\n\nGRAPHICS: Beautiful. From the detailed environments to the characters and NPCs to the huge open sea to the animations, it clearly is one of the best looking games of 2013.\n\nAUDIO:  Solid cast of voice actors and one amazing soundtrack. You'll know you're in for a treat from the main menu’s theme.\n\nMULTIPLAYER:  The usual AC multiplayer, if you love it, you'll love this one even more. If you hate it, it won't change your mind.\n\nOverall, Assassin's Creed IV Blackflag is an amazing game if you forget that it's an AC game. With 50 hours of (mostly great) Single Player content and a good multiplayer it truly deserves a ......\n8.8/10","February 22, 2014","true","53.9"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexpre888/recommended/242050/","alexpre888","Derps von Herpington","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexpre888/","146 products in account","Assassin's Creed IV® Black Flag™ is a sequel to Assassin's Creed III (The reason it is a sequel has to do with modern-day storyline). This game goes one century back in 17th Century during the "Golden Age of Piracy" as you play as Edward Kenway, the father of Haytham Kenway, thus the Grandfather of Ratonhnhaké:ton/Connor (The Protagonist of Assassin's Creed III).\n\n[Visuals]\nThe setting is beautifully made with realistic looking oceans and breathtaking landscapes. The color and beauty is quite well made, it feels like the beauty I once saw in Assassin's Creed II. Each major locations look unique to each other. For Example, Havana has blockly colorish clay houses with sandy streets, Nassau looks like a jungle mix with towns, and Kingston has colorful yet similar Buildings like the ones in Assassin's Creed III. Everything is made pretty darn well.\n\n[Gameplay]\nIt has retain the same concepts in Assassin's Creed III, but much more improved. Hiding in bushes will not always protect you now as enemies will not only search bushes, but can spot you quickly if they are near enough to see you. Combat System has been improved and difficulty is balanced. The new Free-aim system works very well and bodyshooting enemies will not always kill them, so headshots are mostly necessary and reloading the gun(s) are quick and easy. There are changes for the enemies combat as well. They have the ability to tackle you down during a chase, enemies such as Scouts and Captains can attack you in free flow combat similar to what Connor does in Assassin's Creed III. Sharpshooters tend to shoot at you from above and stays there even if you are hiding. The stealth system seems to have Improved and for me it was enjoyable. Naval Combat is the key in this game. Edward's Ship, The Jackdaw, will be greatly relied on and if you enjoyed Naval Combat in Assassin's Creed III, then you will love this as well. Your ship can shoot cannons with correct aiming, Swivel guns aim perfectly, you can shoot fire barrels from behind and shoot chain shots from the front and with some more upgrades, you can use mortars and upgraded rams. These are useful when fighting tougher ships like Man O' Wars. You can now plunder ships when the ship is damaged enough. No cutscenes play during the plundering and moments like these are great. The Wanted System will not apply on land, however it will apply on the sea. As long as you keep plundering ships, your noteriety will increase, which will result pirate hunters to go after you. The higher the noteriety, the bigger the ship(s) will come, and more difficult it becomes. The Crafting System is encouraged so you may have more guns to carry, more health to gain, more ammo to hold, and so on. You can craft simply through the pause menu. You need materials which leads to Hunting, which encouraged to hunt animals such as Iguanas, Deers, Monkeys, and even Crocodiles. If you go further, you can even hunt sea creatures such as hammerhead sharks, great white sharks, humpback whales, Killer whales, and if you are lucky a white whale. Assassin's Creed IV has also introduced underwater exploring for the first time in the series, which you use a Diving Bell to explore and gain treasures in the deep ocean while avoiding dangerous animals such as Great White sharks, Jellyfishes, Sea Urchins, and Moray Eels. You can avoid them by gaining oxygen through barrels or diving bells or hiding in seaweed (Be careful as it may contain a Moray Eel).\n\n[Side Missions and Activities to Do]\nSide Missions are not bad and will have a good reward for you if you finish or collect all things in the game. Assassin Contracts are mostly unique and Naval Contracts are similar to Assassin Contracts, except it involves fighting on the Ocean. There are maps in areas to get so you can find a buried treasure by simply looking at the coordinates and checking the picture of the map which rewards you with either money or more plans to improve the Jackdaw. There are Missions that involves you getting a key to open a room for a new costume to wear. There are Mayan Keystones for you to search around the Map which rewards you a super cool looking costume. Forts are around the area that will shoot you on sight and it can be challenging if it has assistance from other ships, which is another reason to destroy them so they can reveal treasures and locations on certain sections of the map. Finally, if you are brave and powerful enough, you can fight Legendary Ships that will put up a challenge in the seas which is a great addition to the game.\n\n[Story (Modern Day - Abstergo Researcher)]\nYou are an Abstergo Researcher, living the memories of Desmond Miles by using his DNA. The purpose of this is for marketing research as Abstergo was Successful with their product called "Liberation" (Abstergo's version of Assassin's Creed III - Liberation). They now hope to get more marketing possiblities by researching on Edward Kenway. As you go deeper into Edward's life, the more deeper you are in between the war of Assassins and Templars in this timeline. As you progress you will be given the ability to hack into Abstergo Computers, Cameras, and Servers to see information that is not meant for you to see. The story for me was not bad and had me excited for the next game.\n\n[Story (17th Century - Edward Kenway)]\nEdward Kenway is a privateer turned pirate who seeks wealth and fortune. The story revolves mostly about him and his desire for riches and wealth so he may retire a good life through piracy (Common among all pirates). You will see a brash and arrogant protagonist, but as he progresses, he will see clearer of what he does as he unintentionally enters the war between Assassins and Templars. You might hate him and you might love him (I believe that is the purpose in his character development), but either way, he makes a good story for a man who simply wants to be rich.\n\n[Ending (No Spoilers)]\nEdward's story ended surprisingly well. However, Modern-day ended with a cliffhanger. Is it a good or bad cliffhanger you say? I let you decide. Those who have played the entire Assassin's Creed series should no longer be surprised by coming Cliffhanger endings by now.\n\n[Bugs]\nThere are some bugs that I encounter but was never interfering with my gameplay. I must say though, this sort of bug is the most oddest and most epic bug I have ever seen in a game. Sometimes you will have a hole in the water...and...well...lets just say...your sailors might...go to heaven and the jackdaw rises from the sea. or your ship is at the air and will go down quickly like crazy as if peter-pan was trolling Edward. It was the most hilarious bug I have ever seen in my lifetime. Don't let this discourage you, the game is still good to play. Regarding if it is PC optimized, I cannot say. I ran the game well with my 780M card at the highest settings possible, but I cannot say the same for others.\n\nThis game improved greatly from its predecessor and I recommend it. Attempt to pay attention closely to the plot of both modern day and 17th Century as it plays one heck of a major role for the next game.\n\nAdditional Notes: I have finished the game with 100% Synchronization. This is a review for Single-Player Only. Please be aware that I am reviewing the game itself, not the Ubisoft Launcher or anything that has nothing to do with the game, unless it is necessary to be said.\n\nThis game is played on my Laptop:\n- Intel Core i7 4700MQ\n- 8 GB RAM\n- 1 TB 7200 RPM Hard Drive\n- Nvidia Geforce GTX 780M 4 GB\n- Bigfoot Killer Wireless-N 1103","December 7, 2013","true","89.0"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","26","44","0","3"

Well look no further, because this game is a FANTASTIC pirate game! Coming from someone that has never played an AC game, I thought this game was incredible.

It is a comprehensive improvement over its lacklustre predecessor - Assassin’s Creed 3.  There are plenty of interesting side tasks to keep you busy for dozens of hours. The ship combat remains satisfying for just as long and ship upgrades feel worthwhile. While the campaign has a few poor eavesdropping missions, they are offset by quality, varied content. You can spend your time finding buried treasure, whale hunting, ship-wreck diving, plundering convoys or basic assassinations.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Naelok/recommended/242050/","Naelok","ᕙ༼ಠ͜ʖಠ༽ﾌ Naelok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Naelok/","181 products in account","This is a game that has some extremely high points and extremely low points.\n\nLet's start with the good: Sailing. After the first hour or two of faffing about, the game gives you a pirate ship and sets you loose on the seas. Most of the fun times you'll have in the game will be sailing around and getting into incredibly dramatic ship battles on the high seas. If you've ever played Sid Meier's 'Pirates!' then you'll be pleased to know that sailing in Black Flag is basically a modernized version of that. You have to manuever your ship to bring cannons to bear while staying out of their firing zone by managing your ship's speed and manuevers.\n\nIn one memorable moment, I assaulted a British fortress in the middle of a storm, riding waves and dodging artillery as a British Man O War and a pair of Frigates bore down on me. Using a wave to barrel out of the way of an artillery barrage before delivering a round of heavy guns onto a Man O War's backside is absolutely thrilling stuff. The sailing alone is enough to make me recommend the game. It's incredibly fun and incredibly fresh.\n\nThe story (ignoring the modern day headache that the game insists on vomiting onto you now and again) is alright, if fairly predicatable. One problem I had is telling apart the male pirates. It seemed like I killed about 8 pirate guys that betrayed me somehow and I had some sort of beef with. But I didn't really care about the details of the templar/assassin nonsense anyhow, so I'll give the story a pass. I liked James Kidd quite a bit after all.\n\nThe problems with the game are basically everything else.\n\nLet me discuss the major points:\n\nFirst:\nWhenever you go back to land to take an assassination mission, the first thing you'll be asked to do is tail and/or eavesdrop on someone. This involves jumping on a rooftop as they walk along town (and needless to say every town in the Caribbean has a good five or six guards inexplicably guarding rooftops) or hiding in a bush as they walk along. If you fall behind, mission failed, start again. Not fun.\n\nSecond:\nThe land combat is ridiculously easy.\n\nI did some early assassination missions, made some gold and then bought the Wheellock Pistols, which have massive range but do less damage. Unfortunately for every Spanish soldier in the Caribbean, pistol damage means ♥♥♥♥ when a headshot is an instant kill no matter what. For when I did do melee, I had a pair of swords that I bought in the first hour of the game that let me jump around going for a stabathon on all the bad guys without much trouble.\n\nBut honestly, that wasn't even the problem. There are three points in the game where your weapons get arbitrarily taken away in an attempt to get you to use stealth, but even with just your wrist knives you can kill infinite guards with parry and break defense.\n\nSure it's fun at a visceral level to walk up to a fortress of British soldiers and kill everyone inside, but Dark Souls this ain't.\n\nThird:\nThe game wastes time with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nThere's this entire diving minigame with unique mechanics where you've got to dive underwater for some treasure while using air bubbles and dodging sharks. It's a terrible minigame that no one in the right mind would want to play and Ubisoft seemed to recognize this, because you only have to do it once. You can explore ship wrecks as an optional thing on your own, but it's such a tedious busywork section that no one in the right mind would want to do it.\n\nWhich brings us to the central point, which is that Ubisoft has no idea how to tell a good idea from a bad one.\n\nInstead of underwater travel or tailing (and I'm not even going to talk in any detail about the stupid ♥♥♥♥ing modern day office/hacking crap), they could've given the sailing a bit more depth and made more things to do at sea.\n\nAs it stands, the game is great fun up until the point where you've got your ship upgraded to the point where you can take on two Man O Wars with ease. At that point, the game sort of peters out and you'll fast travel from story mission to mission to wrap the thing up.\n\nJust goes to show that while a team behind a game might have talent, you still need a director with a coherent vision to make a game great. Without that vision, you end up with a scatterbrain game like AC: Black Flag.\n\nStill, cool that a brother is heading a big video game project. Keep improving, Ashraf Ismail.","August 2, 2014","true","38.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Due to the crappy whether this weekend, I hibernated inside and finished this game over three days. #nerdout.\n\nI feel like this game tried to be something apart from an Assassin's Creed title. If it was anything other than an Assassin's Creed named game, it would be a very good pirate sim, but because it comes with the name and reputation that the series carries, it some times falls down.  The actual regular normal "on foot" gameplay techniques are a huge improvement over the predecessors. The combat seemed flawless and you can really wrack up some cool looking combos.\n\nBeing a pirate game, I would of excepted to of really enjoyed the captaining the pirate ship, and sailing one into the heart of battle, but it just seemed very clumsy and out of place in an Assassin's Creed game and I almost wanted to skip these parts all together if possible. I just didn't enjoy them.\n\nStory wise, very interesting saga. Enjoyed the story more than the others in the series. Maybe it's because I enjoy the whole pirate tales but it just seems to draw you in.\n\nThis was probably the most impressive game I have played graphically. The SLI Titans in my rig very rarely have to put any effort in, but they at least had to get out of bed to churn the beautiful graphics this game can produce.\n\nThere is huge amount of side quests, missions, activities to complete and treasures to find. The main story for me took about twenty two hours to complete, so that in it self is pretty impressive.\n\nAnother game that you can easily get immersed into by sitting back and playing with a controller on a big screen TV.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Hell yes! Although if you aren't a fan of sailing boats, you have been warned, there is alot of boat type missions. The overall game is very good though. The graphics are simply breathe taking.\n\nMore reviews at - http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/","August 4, 2014","true","21.7"," 32 of 57 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","32","57","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/242050/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","Assassin's Creed IV is the game that Assassin's Creed III should have been. You know... like, actually good and stuff. In that way, it's somewhat similar to the drastic change in quality from AC1 to AC2. Assassin's Creed III had some good ideas, including changes to the controls and overall formula, but ultimately just wasn't as good as the previous games (not to mention it was also buggy as all hell). AC4 takes the improvements that AC3 tried to make and actually implements them - with nary a bug in sight. I suppose it also helps that the setting and main character are far more interesting as well. I mean, seriously... who doesn't dig pirates and adventure on the high seas? You play as privateer Edward Kenway - neither Assassin nor Templar - thrust into the middle of both of those worlds. Edward is one of the better protagonists in the series, and is generally quite likeable.\n\nThe one huge difference that sets Black Flag apart from previous games in the series is its setting - well over half the game takes place on the ocean. And what an ocean it is... seriously, it is huge. And sailing on it is just so very cool. The closest comparison I can make is to exploring the ocean in the Wind Waker on Gamecube back in the day, only much bigger and more realistic. The exploration element alone is great. However, what really sets AC4 apart is the way it looks and feels. In terms of video game technology, it's just amazing what they were able to pull off. You can almost actually feel like you're out on the ocean, as waves and wind make your ship swerve, sway and dip (and just wait until you see all the gorgeous weather effects). I can't imagine any game ever nailing seafaring better than this... (well, at least not until virtual reality sailing comes along). It just feels great. Naval combat also plays a big part in the game. Unfortunately, as fun as it can be, it does have a few problems. You control your weapons by changing the perspective of the camera (look to the ship's side to fire cannons, or to the rear to drop fire barrels, for example). This is all well and good, in theory, but in the heat of battle with multiple enemies, it can get a bit dodgy. By the end of the game, you should have a good handle on it, but it isn't always the easiest thing to manage. By far, the coolest part of combat is boarding other ships. There are no loading screens on the ocean. Ever. This means that any ship you see (and all of the crew members on it) can be engaged in real time, at any time. If you want to jump off your ship and swim to a frigate and kill every dude on board all by yourself, you can do that. If you want to incapacitate a ship with your cannons, get alongside, board it by swinging on a rope and air-assassinating the captain from one of the masts, you can do that. It is very, very fun. But as with anything, repetition will eventually cool those initial highs and you may start to tire of the whole process by the time the latter parts of the game roll along. This is more an inevitability than a knock on the game itself, but should be mentioned. Rounding out the new additions to the series, Black Flag introduces a set of underwater diving locations. These are mostly optional and don't really make or break the game one way or the other. They are just "meh", mostly due to the horrible controls inherent with underwater segments in every game with underwater segments ever made. Ever. There are some cool bits underwater, but these segments could have easily been excluded and it still would have been a decent game.\n\nThe other half of the game takes place in land-based locations, and follows the standard AC series formula. You take on various missions to gather information or assassinate people, which require either stealth, combat, or both. Free-running and climbing also return and are generally OK, though the usual issues (like climbing onto things you aren't trying to climb onto in the heat of the moment) are still ocasionally present. Combat is similar to previous games as well. Mostly all you need to do is button mash and use counters or break enemy defenses at the appropriate moments. As simple as it is, it is still ever so satisfying, due to the insane number of moves you can pull off in various situations - put simply, you are a serious badass. There is also a very limited number of different weapons available (contrary to previous games), which is a welcome change. There's no longer 3 inventory screens' worth of pointless weapons you'll never use. Early on, you'll be able to buy a good set of swords and pistols. Those, along with your hidden blades, are pretty much all you'll ever want or need for the majority of the game. The land-based segments take place in 3 major locations - Havana, Nassau and Kingston. Additionally, there are a number of smaller islands scattered around the ocean that contain fishing villages, ruins, and more. Overall, it's a nice balance between traditional AC and the newer naval bits.\n\nThe last part of the package is a sub-plot that continues the goings-on in the modern-day time period. With Desmond out of the picture (mostly), you play as an unnamed employee in the game division of the Abstergo Corporation. I don't mind these sections too much, but for those of you who don't care about these present-day bits, just know that most of these sections are optional, and the parts that are required can be done pretty quickly. The optional activities available involve "hacking" a bunch of computers, which unlocks various bits of lore and info on what has happened since the events of the previous game. If you are into following that part of the series, some of it is pretty interesting. Otherwise, these optional bits can simply be ignored.\n\nOverall, I found this to be a worthy entry in a series I thought was on its last (peg?) legs. The amount of things to do is pretty insane, and I found almost everything to be pretty dang fun. That said, I am also somewhat easy to please, and kind of anal when it comes to games that have any kind of collecting aspect... so take that opinion for what it's worth. A lot of how much you enjoy this game will depend on how much you dig the new seafaring aspect, since it is such a large portion of the experience. I can see how it might be hit or miss for some people. If you liked the naval missions in AC3, then you will most definitely enjoy the improvements Black Flag makes in that area. If you hated those missions, I hesitate to recommend AC4 wholeheartedly (though you very well may still enjoy it). If you've never played an AC game before, or haven't played one in a long time, this is a great one to jump into the series with. It's definitely not perfect, but it's pretty solid overall. I'd rank it up there with the better games in the AC2 era. I'd give it a B+ or A-.","January 6, 2014","true","64.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","2"

Previous titles made me uninstall them after a couple of hours but this one is absolutely solid and enjoyable experience. The story is interesting and has some unexpected plot twists. The whole "pirate" stuff is also nice and fun to do. Unfortunately the combat system is still about mashing two buttons until all your enemies are dead. Naval battles are better but with some upgrades your ship becomes way too powerful and even high ranked enemy ships can't stop you. Hunting is fun but when you got everything you need becomes useless. Graphics looks pretty and effects like smoke and fog are really well done.\nOverall AC IV is absolutely worth purchaising and speding your time among the carribean pirates.","December 21, 2013","true","29.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Within AC4: BF there is crafting, naval fleet management & trading, item collection, hunting, harpooning, piracy, exploring and of course the third-person assassination missions that we all know and love from the franchise. AC4: BF is absolute fun and has become the premier pirate game.

Sue me.) and I haven't encountered any bugs, either (apart from the occasional sword phasing through some of the outfits, but I have yet to see a game where that doesn't happen).\n\nThe parcour pathfinding is no less aggravating than it could be in previous games, and there are some climb-able things it really hates, such as a few parts of mast and rigging, as well as the occasional tree. Fluidly running over rooftops and the like works good, though - if you can find enough rooftops to run over, that is.\nYou don't need to constantly hold down three keys (forward, sprint and freerunning) anymore, only two; you only need the third one for jumps deemed 'unsafe' by the pathfinding, which is definitely an improvement.\n\nHand-to-hand (or, well, sword-to-sword) combat is okay, but neither particularly hard nor terribly exciting. Very satisfying, though, and it looks awesome.\n\nNaval combat, however, is fluid, streamlined and just plain fun once you get the hang of it.\nThe only thing that is probably even more fun than naval combat is sailing: The different weather conditions are beautiful to watch (look out for high waves during sunshine - the color of the sea when the sunlight shines through the waves is a very nice and very pretty touch), if occasionally slightly aggravating (hello there, super-dense fog and intense storms with unfortunate timing) but ah, the things you gladly suffer for a bit of realism.\nThe ship handles very nicely too, and the level of texture you can see even while sailing is incredible.\n(Also, bonus point for sea shanties, dangit! Best thing ever. Although the soundtrack if you deactivate them is glorious, too. Win/win.)\n\nI don't know if I've mentioned it yet, but the game is stunningly beautiful. Very detailed, very nicely textured and well made, with a very clean, intricate and atmospheric look.\nIf you're anything like me you'll probably end up climbing sync points more for the looks than for anything else, especially because the map is a good deal less integral to you finding your way around than it used to be.\n\nThe only thing that I don't like about AC4 is the amount of wasted potential: AssCreed needs a more captivating story than AC4 has and as much as I love it as it is, it probably would've been the game of my dreams if they'd just made a pure pirate game out of it and expanded on the pirate-y parts of it. The Assasin parts of the game do feel a bit tacked on every now and then.\n\nStill, I don't regret spending money on this - it was totally worth every cent of it and I can full-heartedly recommend it - it may not be a perfect game, but it is a very, very good one.","July 27, 2015","true","97.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Third person parcour, forgiving stealthy or go loud game, which is not meant to completely run & gun. I played the first two tittles before Black Flag. Here is my impression on this one:\n\nWhat remained:\n\n- Beautiful, large open world.\n- Great atmosphere\n- Love to detail regarding historical costumes.\n- Senseless meta story\n- Repetitive elements\n- Nice puzzle minigames entering terminals. Though to a lesser extent than the previous episodes had.\n- As with the other parts: Too many collectibles, simply to inflate playtime.\n\nWhat improved:\n\n- Naval battles are fun and intuitive, capturing an enemy's vessel is great.\n- Key bindings for PC players make more sense and are easier compared to AC1 & 2.\n- The shanty catching quests are a worthy replacement for the race ontop of the roofs parcour challenges.\n\nWhat got worse:\n- Berserk darts are simply game-breaking due to their long range. The poison syringe in AC2 already made things a lot easier, but this is an overkill. Besides, the animations are far more boring and it makes no sense that someone on a berserk dart kills the own people but spares civis. Was much more fun in AC2.\n- Second point is the new climbing system, which might have been introduced together with AC3: It is beautiful, if you can leap seemlessly from branch to branch in the forests, but the same mechanics let you clinch on every corner or jump ontop of treasure chests, you simply wanted to open up. This was always a problem but since the parcour part used to be a little harder w/o this change, that glitch didn't happen that often before.\n- The corruption of statistical information, aka "progress tracker". Now even subquests are added to the main story's tracker and some values like collectibles are counted double (as "location" and as "side activity")! This slows the progress increase down for a looong time.\n- Ok, eavesdropping events are a staple of the franchise, but this has gone overboard to me with this one. Same goes for the tail-your-man missions.\n- Skins, impossible to use, because they were rewards of long-gone community challenges? Unbelievable!\n\nWhat I like about this franchise is that real contemporary characters (mere commoners, not just the famous ones) are picked according to their value to the story. So the backstory to these characters is always authentic, like a merchant  turned pirate or a nun opening up a brothel in Renaissance Italy.\nThe story is the same since part 1 though and quite incoherent this time. These contemporary characters are rather thrown in than fitted in nicely: Ok, the barmaid turns pirate for the looks of it, but Adewale complaining about searching for a fairy tale castle, though he should be most appreciative of the whole crew, being an assassin?\n\nOutfits which contain stat boosts are meh, if I can't choose them and simply add the boost. Most of the time, the puffy native Indian outfit is the most useful, which is sad indeed.\nThe rope darts are given for the last 20% of the main story and nobody knows why, since there is anyway enough to make this game far easier than the previous parts.\n\nBut what an amazing game this could have been, if the marketing department had less of a say in it!\nThe real meta story of the game, which was well fit in between all the character information is the battle between devs and marketing department which was added as some ironic side twist in a form of managerial comments: "Should we mention slavery? People want to hear postive stuff..." - This picking on stupid marketing department phrases makes this game really worthwhile - besides it is an enjoyable but repetitive game.\nIf it wasn't for the nice Caribbean environment and the cool navy battles, this part would be worse than AC2.","March 16","true","165.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That might have some bearing on my opinions of it, maybe not. This game is pretty damned good, though. Even without the (what I assume to be) over-arching AC story, it stands up. The modern-day stuff could have, in my opinion, been taken out entirely and it would have #1 been just fine and #2 made just as much sense story-wise.\n\nBeing a pirate is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. I haven't seen a game yet that really captures the feeling of sailing on the high seas as well as this one. It's not exactly like LoZ: Wind Waker, where you have to be mindful of the wind direction and such, but it feels really good anyway. The naval combat is superb as well, and while the boarding actions (and the resulting cinematics afterwards) don't necessarily seem realistic in the midst of a huge battle, but it works anyway. Upgrading the ship feels really good, too. You can customize your sail color and figurehead with unlockables, but there's really no better than the Crimson sails, which you get fairly early on and I never changed. Finding upgrade plans in underwater chests and with treasure maps is always neat as well, and really gives you a reason to explore. And honestly, you'll be exploring anyway. The game mostly open-world, so you can completely disregard the main story-to a degree-and just explore and conquer the seas. My advice, though, would be to at least progress throught he story until you get the diving bell. It's really not all that far in and you need it for certain ship upgrades. I made the mistake of conquering about 50% of the map before I did that, but it's not really a huge deal.\n\nThe hand-to-hand combat is a bit trivial, you really only need to wait to block, then hit kill. Not a lot of challenge, but it's fun anyway usually. All the stealth bits are also there as you would expect from an AC game, and those are done well.\n\nSo what's bad? Well, like I said before, I gave 0 ♥♥♥♥s about the modern day missions. They kinda sucked me out of the game, and while they don't last too long, they're kinda boring and have pointless mini games thrown in. One of them is literally just Frogger. They also pair you up with an IT guy with all the social skills of a broom in a dark closet. Just an annoying character. And to top it all off, towards the end of the game it gets stupid. Like, really stupid. This is one of those moments where maybe it would make more sense if I had played the earlier AC games, but they don't give much explanation for it here and it's just a big wtf moment. Like, I just want to go around doing awesome pirate ♥♥♥♥, but they make me walk around (because that's all you can do in modern-day missions) and watch some weird ♥♥♥♥ they offer no real explanation for. There's hints about the ongoing Templar-Assassin war happening even today, but it still felt really unnecessary.\n\nThat's honestly my only complaint. It's an aweome game, being a pirate is fun as hell, they tie in a lot of actual historical figures from the Age of Piracy, the sailing is great, harpooning is awesome, I just disliked the modern stuff. But hey, that's what the series is. Would definitely recommend, even for those who haven't played Assassin's Creed before.","March 23","true","48.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

I actually never really all enjoyed the series with the exception of the first.\n\nBUT THIS IS AN EFFING PIRATE SIMULATOR (or as close to one as you can get). While the game never takes away the copy paste element of ALL the other Assassin's Creed games, this one has a much more tollerable experience... if you like pirates and simulated games. Black flag has stunning realism in the ocean sailing. There are strangely fun events to partake in and loads of ships to sink, destroy, or board. While you do still do the traditional island hunting, stalking, hawk diving, assasinating of traditional Assasin's Creed games, it's a bit more free roam. Therefore, it will not force you to continue the story line if you just want to kill some whales and blow up ships. Upgrades for your ships, and crafting elements are apparent in this one.\n\nI'd say Black Flag is one of the best, top notch Assassin's Creed games released so far. On PC, expect some framerate dips if you aren't running a brand new $1000 rig, but it's not unplayable. Expect some frustrations with controlling your charecter without a controller as well. I'd strongly reccommend a PC controller for this game. It will make movement on land (with all the traditional Assassin's Creed's mechanics) and sailing your ship far easier.\n\nNone the less, Assassin's fans will have a different viewpoint than myself. As not-so-much a cult follower of the series, to another Assassin's fan, get it. To a non-Assassin's fan like myself, it's worth at least finding a friend that has it to try it. You may be impressed. Perhaps you'll get it on sale, never beat the game, and roam the ocean like I do. I'm pretty pleased with the sailing myself. Then again, I always wanted to be a pirate. RRRGGG!!!\n\n4.0/5 for an Assassin's Creed game\n4.5/5 for a pirate simulator\n\nI'd pay $30 for this game anyday. Not sure if I'd really pay all that much more for it though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MUGARO/recommended/242050/","MUGARO","418","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MUGARO/","253 products in account","I spent about 40 hours playing this game.  Gameplay wise, it's great.  The gameplay is the same engine as AC3.  Edward Kenway controls the same as Haytham & Connor Kenway.  The ship traveling is the same mechanic but improved greatly.  Sailing island to island, ship combat, boarding an enemy ship & plundering all their loot is a lot of fun & something I did probably over 50 times.\n\nThe gameplay is perfect, no complaints here.  I wouldn't spend 40 hours if the gameplay was flawed.\n\nThe big part of every AC game is the story, and I have kind of mixed feelings about the story here.  On one hand, it's a great story with great characters that takes place in the Assassin's Creed universe, but the whole assassins vs templars thing isn't necessarily the main plot going on.  All of the supporting characters are interesting, but I have these complaints with it:\n\n1) The main villain of the story is barely seen only a few times through out the entire game, we really don't get to know much about him which is a major contrast to how well we got to know previous AC villains, especially the villains in AC3 which we knew quite well, only Revelations had a villain we knew less about.\n\n2) For that matter, pretty much all of the antagonists don't really get much screen time.  While some characters become good guys & others become bad guys, very little time is devoted to developing any of the other characters that aren't one of the main 5 or so characters.\n\n3) The motive is kind of hard to understand.  It starts out simple: "I want booty, gotta get rich or die trying" and it progresses into something more complicated, but it skips a lot of steps that explain why Edward has a change of heart and develops into a more mature character.\n\nAt one point in the end of the game, one of the villains makes a comment that he's lost everyone in his life thanks to him & the other villains, but that's not true.  He was already divorced/separated from his wife before the game started.  A few of his friends died or betrayed him, but it wasn't necessarily due to anything the villains or Edward did.  It was the villain taking credit for what wasn't his to take credit for.  At some points, Edward shows that he cares about people in his life and at other points, acts like nobody matters to him but himself.\n\nAnd I'm trying to not spoil anything, but come on AC games always have plot twists and characters dying.\n\nHaving gotten these flaws out of the way, it's still a very fun game.  I'm actually curious where they're going with the modern day 2013 storyline again, where as the 2012 storyline in AC3 was pretty boring.  Ubisoft has said they've thought of an ending that will be final & ultimate, but I have a feeling they're going to keep milking out yearly AC titles until the cash cow runs dry, ala Call of Duty.  At any rate, AC Unity looks pretty damn good, I'll be getting it probably around Christmas.\n\nFinal verdict: 8.4/10  Better than AC1 & AC3, but the Ezio trilogy still reigns supreme.","August 11, 2014","true","43.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackmoore04/recommended/242050/","jackmoore04","Odyssey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackmoore04/","165 products in account","Black Flag is a bit of an oddity in the Assassin's Creed Franchise. It's difficult to say if it's a good Assassin's Creed game because it is quite a bit different, both thematically and mechanically, than it's predecessors. Fortunately this is actually very good thing in a franchise that has seen a bit of a decline in terms of quality over the years. At the very least, I will say that this is the best pirate themed game that I've ever played, as well as one of my favourite games flat out.\n\nFirst things first, this game just oozes atmosphere. The locations you get to visit are all interesting aesthetically as well as being quite varied from one another. There's a pirate cove full of debauchary and friends, there's English and Spanish colonies, independant islands and small stretches of land barely big enough to walk on. The great design choice is the fact that you don't spend the game in a couple of cities, you spend it exploring. The journey between all of the story specific islands and landmasses is genuinely entertaining because the world is a such a joy to explore. It's not just a case of the graphics being good (which they certainly are), it's the fact that the world is very nicely crafted and a lot of detail has been added in.\n\nThe way in which you move through the world is twofold, you sail around the world in your ship, or you leave the ship and wander about doing the various story and side missions scattered around the world. You are somewhat stopped from simply going wherever you want by the game placing much more difficult to defeat ships in some of the locations you are meant to visit later on in the game. Theoretically you could just take these down, but it's more likely you would get absolutely trashed. I won't complain about this as an artificial way of stopping you from doing whatever you please, because it makes sense from a narritive point of view: the bigger ships protect the more lucrative trade routes and areas.\n\nThe absolute best part of this game however is undoubtedly the ship itself. The Jackdaw. Your home for the game and where the real pirating is done. After a brief period of adjusting to the controls of the ship it becomes second nature to be behind it's wheel. The game is just oozing in theme, and the ship is no exception. Your trusty crew will sing sea shanties as you sail around and you'll soon find your favourite ones and have them memorised. Upgrading the Jackdaw over time is an entertaining distraction and once you reach the upper echelons of the upgrade tree you'll really notice the difference in power. You can customise aspects of it, such as the prow, the sails and the interior to your liking.\n\nThe ship combat is very robust and I didn't find myself bored of raiding other ships even towards the end of my playthrough. You sometimes find yourself in combat with two or even three larger ships and the hectic nature of battles in the high seas really shines through. It's especially satisfying blasting a full broadside and watching another ship begin to sink. Of course, this is a pirate game, so after weakening an enemy ship you have the option to board it, during which you will engage the enemy in hand to hand combat. As as assassin you will always have the upper hand in the melee, but your crew will be helping you out as well. One of my few complaints about the game is that boarding can become quite tedious. You are expected to kill a certain amount of the enemy ship's crew before they surrender their cargo, but on the bigger ships this often ends up being 25 kills. When you're already fighting multiple ships and you have to do this two or three times, it can become somewhat irritating.\n\nUpon capturing enemy ships you have 3 options, patch up your own ship, reduce your wanted level or add them to your own fleet. Your wanted level increases the more ships you loot or sink in a short period of time, and progressively stronger bounty hunters will head your way, actively seeking you out wherever you happen to be with the intention of taking you out. It's pretty easy to reduce but it's a cool little mechanic.\n\nAs for sending ships to your own fleet, this game introduces a little minigame where you can send your own fleet of ships on missions to earn you resources which can be used to upgrade your own ships. It takes a little while to get used to but it can be a fun distraction, though I wouldn't say it's really necessary to do, perhaps just a time saver if you really want rarer resources quicker. If I was being cynical, it feels like ubisoft wanted this to be a game you play all the time, because the bigger missions take 9 hours (real time, not playtime) to complete, which is a bit ridiculous if you're like me and marathon games. That being said, I did have fun with the fleet system, and capturing bigger ships to add to your fleet is a nice distraction.\n\nThe story follows Edward Kenway's progression from pirate to assassin, with some interesting characters along the way, such as Blackbeard and Mary Read. At the same time it does continue the story from the previous games.  Of course, this is another story of the battle between assassins and templars, but I actually felt motivated to do a lot of the missions because I was doing them for other pirates. I feel like Edward's motivation to become an asssassin is credible and believable, as he learns various lessons throughout his journey in the game that convinces him he needs to follow a better path. The story overall is fun, if a little short. I feel like how much you care about the story would affect your enjoyment of the game somewhat. I didn't really care too much about the assassin/templar thing, but it drew me in towards the end of the game.\n\nYou are using an animus throughout the game, with the motivation being that you are working for a company trying to make a pirate game using the memories of Kenway. This takes place in the offices of Abstergo, and you're able to wander about the offices to find some nice tidbids and story pieces from the previous games. There's a really cool twist at the end as well. If you blast through the main story, it probably won't take you very long, but if you're like me and you mix in the main story with exploring, you can greately extend the amount of time you play.\n\nThere's some cool little things to do on the side. Hunting is one of the standout features, in particular hunting whales and other large sea creatures. Unfortunately, without properly upgrading your harpoon it's very hard to actually catch any of them. You can use the pelts/materials of the animals you hunt for gear and to upgrade Edward's abilities as well. You can use treasure maps to find hidden booty, find pieces of sheet music to add to your list of sea shanties and various other distractions. My favourite part is that you can go underwater in a diving bell and feel the fear of hiding from sharks while you look for treasure.\n\nThe biggest problem is that you have to use Uplay, which is third party DRM within the DRM which is steam already. Thankfully I had no issues with this, but a lot of people have had very negative experiences with it.\n\nFinally, I feel I have to talk about the musical score. The music really is incredible at capturing the atmosphere of the game, and there are some truly memorable pieces which I still listen to from time to time. The sea shanties are excellently done and make you feel like you're really part of the crew.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing. It's almost a shame that's it's an assassin's creed game, because at times I felt like it could have been something much more if it wasn't shackled into the franchise, with certain expectations and necessities being in the game. The feeling of freedom and joy sailing around the map is an unforgettable experience for me and I can't recommend this game enough. Perhaps it's not the Assassin's Creed you're used to, but I feel like that's a really good thing.","December 27, 2015","true","37.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dylanai/recommended/242050/","dylanai","Luminaire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dylanai/","500 products in account","Black Flag is as big of an improvement over ACIII as ACII was over the original Assassin's Creed; while ACIII took the series' trademark parkour gameplay mechanics and applied them to an open world, much of that world's freedom was limited or illusory. Black Flag makes the biggest leap forward the series has taken yet by giving you true freedom to go wherever you please whenever you please. Unlike ACIII's overlong prologue, Black Flag thrusts you right into the action and has you at the helm of a seafaring vessel very early - after a few introductory missions, the game centers itself squarely around sailing & naval combat which gels with the spirit & magic of Assassin's Creed's distinctive gameplay. There are a huge array of side quests and tangential, self-contained missions alongside the main story which you can go through at your own pace, and the light RPG elements return in the form of levelling up your weapons and ship as you progress through new waters. What makes this formula special isn't the plot or characters (some are likeable though not particularly memorable) but the world they inhabit - so alive it practically pulses with its own energy in a unique fictional slice of history - combined with freedom of exploration & activity. I've spent hours at a time sailing aimlessly through the sun-filled isles of the West Indies simply watching the weather change or engaging in naval battles and looting ships before taking to shore to stretch my legs and run through the jungles of deserted isles or the dense populace and buildings of bigger cities. There are buried treasures and letters in bottles to be found across a large map, a variety of animals to hunt in different regions to craft upgrades and new outfits, and even underwater swimming sections in which you evade sharks and other deep-sea dangers in pursuit of sunken wealth. Gone is the overarching present-day storyline featuring Desmond & Co. (which had grown very stale and convoluted); the Animus returns, but in an entirely new context that's creative & fun and features some ingenious meta-game narrative flourishes.\n\nBlack Flag is, in my opinion, by far the best Assassin's Creed game to date, with the more dated and linear yet still brilliant ACII trailing behind. It had injected a sense of wonder & adventure into a series that had grown stale, and it gives players the closest experience they'll ever have to being a seafaring pirate during the golden age of piracy. It may be the best naval action & simulator game ever made, and it combines the best elements of the series with a true open world sandbox I still marvel over and bound around in to this day. Whether you're already an initiated Assassin's Creed fan or new to the series, this comes with my highest recommendation as it's one of the greatest adventure games in recent memory.","April 12","true","140.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Set during the early 18th century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, the story follows notorious pirate Edward Kenway, the grandfather of Assassin's Creed III's protagonist Ratonhnhaké:ton, who stumbles upon the conflict that's waged by the Assassins and Templars. Unlike most of the previous games, gameplay elements focus more on ship-based exploration in the open world map, while still also retaining the series' third-person land-based exploration, melee combat, and stealth system. Multiplayer also returns, albeit with only land-based modes and settings. Assassin's Creed IV has three new main cities; Havana, Kingston, and Nassau, which is currently residing under the Spanish, British, and pirate influence, respectively. Assassin's Creed IV has a much more open world feel, with missions that are very similar to those found in Assassin's Creed, as well as fewer restrictions for you. The world opens up much sooner in the game, as opposed to Assassin's Creed III, which had very scripted missions and did not give the player freedom to explore until the game was well into its first act. You will encounter jungles, forts, ruins, and small villages. The world is built to allow you to have much more freedom. Assassin's Creed IV also features 50 other individual locations including atolls, sea forts, Mayan ruins, sugar plantations and underwater shipwrecks to explore, with a 60/40 balance between land and naval exploration. A new aspect in the game is the Jackdaw, the ship that the notorious pirate Edward Kenway captains. The Jackdaw is upgradeable throughout the game, and it is very easily accessible to you when needed. In addition, a new underwater component has also been added. You now have access to a spyglass, which allows for the examination of distant ships, along with all of their cargo and their current strength. Overall I give this game a solid 10/10 it is by far the best Assassin's Creed game I've played. I really recommend this game because I am 100% sure that Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag will not disappoint you in anyway at all!.","November 30, 2014","true","95.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198171238315/recommended/242050/","76561198171238315","danstew23","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198171238315/","104 products in account","This is the first review that I have to start with the classic "I wish there was a neutral rating button" line.\n\nLet's start with the positive: The game looks really nice, the areas are beautiful, the music is nice, so are the Shanties. If you liked the naval battle in AC III, you will love it here, it is a lot of fun, especially once you upgrade your ship. Sailing on the ocean in the Jackdaw with your crew singing... just very immersive and looks awesome.\n\nAlso, even though there are some pirate-clichés, the game is surprisingly accurate when it comes to the development of the whole pirate-scene in the carribean. I recently read two books about it (it almost seems as if the story-writer here read at least one of them), and they kinda show you how it all came to be, where those pirates came from. So not as many clichés with peglegs, parrots on the shoulder, eyepatch and yaarrr.\n\nHowever, I wish they had put this out as a standalone pirate-game, not a part of the AC-franchise. Either they tried to attract more people who are into pirates, and so many apparently are, or they really tried to really mix things up, really try to change the scenery big time in order to reinvigorate the franchise.\n\n***Slight story spoilers ahead*** IMO, it does not work. So here we have a greedy pirate, who often enough acts like a jerk, who gets marooned with an assassin. He kills that assassin with surprising ease, puts on a clothes, suddenly knows how to use eagle view, and tadaa, new protagonist for AC4. It doesn't work for me. I was like "What, that's it? He steals this guys clothes and weapons and now suddenly has assassin abilities"?\n\nEdward's main motivation is greed. People complained about a rather stoic Connor or how Shay in Rogue betrays the assassins and becomes a templar. Here we have a guy who mainly cares for gold. How is that for a sympathetic hero? I know that eventually, he realizes there are other things, but how many hours into the game is that? EVen Shay, who betrays the Assassins, has more honorable intentions as he wants to stop the assassins from dealing with things much too powerful after thousands of people died.\n\nI get that people love the pirate side of things, and if this was just a pirate game, I'd give it a big thumbs up as one of the nicest pirate games. But do people really say "Man, I love this franchise with this ancient order of highly trained assassins and their everlasting fight against templars. Now, the new assassin is a greedy pirate who stabs an assassin, and we'll drink rum, sink ships and be a pirate and assassin?"\nSure, lots of people LOVE pirates, and I guess many waited for another good pirate game, so I am sure for many, an AC with pirates was perfect. However, I care mostly about the assassins, characters, storyline, historic settings, and in that regard, to me, BF is not a good entry. Innovation is good, especially since the series ran out of ideas lately, but to simply blend the franchise with a safe bet theme (pirates. What's next? Wild West?) doesn't work IMO\n\nIt just doesn't work for me personally, I am sorry, even though I am happy for those who actually consider this the best AC.\n\nNow, while the devs put in a lot of changes (like the diving, shanties, the new blowpipe which you shoot berserk- and sleep-darts with, new mechanics to naval battles, the fleet etc), they also apparently ran out of time or ideas regarding the main missions. The amount of tailing and eavesdropping here is frustatingly horrible. At some point, I quit playing because I couldn't STAND YET ANOTHER eavesdropping mission. You start a mission (or templar hunt), sneak up on someone and tail him, having to stay out of sight, not aggro guards, not getting to close, or eavesdrop for quite some time.\n\nIf this would have happened like, 3-4 times in the game, it might have been fun even. But the amount of these quests here is silly. I just tried to get back into the game after  a long break, started the next mission, and guess what? Another tailing one. Afterwards, I started a templar hunt in town, and guess what? Eavesdrop.\n\nIt wouldn't even be as bad if the hiding and parcouring would be more precise. The game still suffers from some control flaws... not as bad as they sometimes where in AC2, but it's less "safe" than in, say, Unity or Syndicate. I have played every AC so far, and yes, misjumps and mistakes happen. But they happen WAY less in those newer games. If you are supposed to totally stay out of sight and follow a pretty strict route set up by the devs (for some of the eavesdrops), it only works if the controls are really tight. They often are, but still, sometimes it doesn't work.\n\nSame for combat. I played Rogue in between, and blocking in that game was much more precise than it is in BF.\n\nOptional content? Of course, you have a metric ton of that in game, just like in most other Ubisoft games. However, it's not so optional. I disliked the diving with the overly aggressive sharks. However, at some point, you can't continue the storyline if you haven't upgraded your ship enough. Only way to do that is with blueprints eventually which you get from underwater shipwrecks. So if you dislike the diving, get ready to do some more.\nEven if Rogue has more of a polarizing setup (Assassin goes templar) and might look more bland (icebergs, snow, polar-like areas), and is VERY similar to BF, it did many things better. Taking over forts actually makes more sense (more profit), blueprints are hidden in wrecks on land, so jump-puzzles rather than diving. In Rogue, you also can skip the fleet-combat (minigame with your fleet), at the risk of losing a ship or two. The fleet-battles in BF cant be skipped, and even though they might be fun at first in a FB-game type way, it actually gets dull.\n\nSo, here is my verdict:\n+ Great pirate game (- ...unfortunately, it's an AC game)\n+ Naval battles are fun\n+ Beautiful zones\n+ Lots of things to do\n+ Nice touch with the history of pirates\n\n- Jerky main character which to me is much less likeable than even Arno, Shay or Connor\n- Edward at first seemed like a sneaky attempt to copy Jack Sparrow. Boy, was i wrong. Wait until you meet the guy who temporarily maroons you on an island later on. It's ridiculous how much they ripped Sparrow here.\n- Diving IMO sucks\n- Diving is kinda mandatory for blueprints\n- Controls not as precise as they should be\n- While lots of things were innovated... the amount of tailing and eavesdropping is simply ridiculous, same with some of the chases.\n- Fleet is nice for income etc, but eventually, it takes too long, wish you could skip to the results like in Rogue.\n\nI get why people love this, but to me, it's not very AC-like. Assassins and pirates is a stretch, but the way Edward is introduced is ridiculous.\nEven if Rogue is considered "BF V2", because it's so similar, and even though its story might not be for everyone, it did MANY things better than BF.\nI personally rate this above Syndicate and Liberation, but below Unity, Rogue, ACII to AC III.\n\nIf you want a great pirate game, check this out. If you always wanted assassins doing the pirate-thing, enjoy. If you're like me, mixing them doesn't work well, and Edward is pretty much my least favorite assassin. The game has quite a few things going for it, and would normally be a 7, as AC 4 I rate it a 5-6, especially because of the story and overuse of certain mechanics/types of missions. Was torn between thumbs up and down, but as an AC-game, it's not something I recommend after enjoying the other ACs so much\n\nBefore you go "Dude, 35 hrs in game...thats a good value"... I did restart the game eventually after I first lost interest, and even though I played it a bit, it never was remotely as enjoyable as the previous or later episodes, even though Syndicate was even worse IMO","June 3","false","45.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The best Assassin's Creed game after Assassin's Creed 2. The story, albeit slow, is amazing. The combat mechanics has improved. Totaly like the dual cutlass. The main focus is on the sea where you travelled between islands with your ship, the Jackdaw. You can upgrade and customize your ship. Now the secondary objectives only applies to the story mission. You can play on the sea all day long pirating, attacking ships, plundering, harpooning, diving etc. The music is great too, especially the Jackdaw's "radio". The Kenway's Fleet minigame is good for extra income and you can play it with your smart devices by installing their app. Multiplayer is awesome as always. It got Game Lab mode which allows you to customize a game. Wolfpack coop mode also got improved.\n\nThe parts that I don't like is lack of weapons. In this game, you only have cutlass and hidden blade for combat. No small weapons anymore like previous game. But you got pistols, 4 of them which is good.  Assassination missions are same and boring, but the final reward is awesome (pistol sword FTW XD). No more silent ranged assassination since no bow or crossbow. Dunno pirates don't like bows. The main villain didn't get much spotlight and kinda forgettable. Collecting uncharted chests and Animus fragments is a hassle.\n\nThis game deserve 9/10.

They actually went back to their roots and released an amazing sequel. The way Edward acts and associates with the different orders is total gold. Everything the old games brought they improved on with this one and created a HUGE world to explore. I actually want to explore and do every side quest; unlike in AC3 where it was bland and boring. Edward is a killing machine, dual wielding swords and wrecking guards like the good old days. New hero new game, spot on masterpiece.\n\nAs someone who hated AC3's version of ship battles I was surprised how much i enjoyed Black Flag's. They expanded on the ship battles: boarding, more guns, and rain mortars to destroy more and more to make your ship stronger. Nothing dragged on or felt out of place. The missions were enjoyable, and I like how they implemented a rating system for feedback on if you hated the mission or if they were well done. Also the addition to salvage underwater wrecks and the environment down there was just beautiful.\n\nThe only downside I could see is the story isn't as gripping as Ezio's story. It was good, but Ezio's story was just fantastic and untouchable on scales beyond all comparison. Edward is a pirate, he plunders and steals booty that is all he cares about. He mocks the creed and laughs doing it. Although it doesn't hit the level of legend Ezio could hit, Blackbeard and the other pirates are enjoyable to listen to and work with; unlike Connor's story/acquaintances.\n\nOverall I give this a solid 8.8/10.\n\nAlso buy Freedom's Cry DLC, Adewale has a great story, and was a character I loved in the main story.\n","January 12, 2014","true","56.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimalHunter_779/recommended/242050/","PrimalHunter_779","PrimalHunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimalHunter_779/","383 products in account","Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ is the sixth installment in the Assassin's Creed series; this installment sets out with a new protagonist, setting and other mechanics in order to reinvigorate the series after the somewhat mediocre affair of Assassin's Creed III. I can safely say that Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ is the installment I have enjoyed the most, and will be incredibly appealing to newcomers of the series and long time fans.\nThis time the player is in control of Edward Kenway; legendary pirate and grandfather of Connor from Assassin's Creed III. Edward isn't a member of the Assassin order, and only manages to join their ranks by murdering one of their own and stealing the dead Assassin's garments. Edward's roguish behaviour puts him at odds with the stoic mysticism of the Assassin's, and sets the tone of light hearted pirate adventures in the Caribbean. Edward and his companions are wonderfully voice acted, and are incredibly entertaining to interact with. Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ probably sets the bar for the best narrative of the series, and the change in perspective makes incredibly positive contributions to this.\nGameplay in Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ consists of sailing to various locations, engaging in city exploration, engaging in naval combat, and the usual parkour/sword fights from the other games. Edward's pirate ship, the Jackdaw, allows him to sail between ports such as Havana and Nassau to collect the usual assassination quests, synchronisation towers, collectables and other Assassin's Creed stuff. You can use the Jackdaw to sail to these locations via the open seas, or fast travel via the map menu. On the seas, you can engage in a more refined version of the excellent naval combat from Assassin's Creed III; this consists of using mortars and other ship-based weaponry to completely obliterate enemy vessels or severely damaging them so you can board and steal cargo and passengers. This is incredinly entertaining and it helped to make this installment feel fresh and unique after the relative lack of innovation evident in previous titles. The open-ness of the world in Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ in addition to the encouraged exploration and open ended mission objectives help make this feel like a very unique experience and far more enjoyable to play.\nOn a technical level, Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ satisfies in most areas. The PC optimisation leaves a little to be desired, but the suite of options is perfectly acceptable. The visuals in this game are particularly nice, with special mention going to the excellent foliage, fog, water and lighting effects. This game often looks quite dazzling due to the nice colour palette used in most areas.\nIn conclusion, Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ is an excellent game that has managed to reinvigorate a dying franchise with new mechanics and an exciting story, complete with entertainingly interesting characters. The excellent naval mechanic provides a fascinating new angle complete with awesome upgrades and a wealth of content to work through. I can easily recommend Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ to fans of the series or anyone looking for a great open-world action game.","January 23, 2015","true","17.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

Ready to sail the Caribbean? Assassins Creed IV lets you do just that. Assassins Creed IV is a large step-up from Assassins Creed III. The naval combat is much improved and sailing around is generally a good time. The graphics are beautiful if your GPU can handle it. They made huge strides to improve ambient life and vegetation, and it really paid off. Everything is an improvement, except one thing. I feel like I was cheated out of land battles and exploration on land. The 3 cities you get are not enough for my type of exploration. Another city would have made this game a 9.9/10 for me. Having said that, I give this game a good 9/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LDR/recommended/242050/","LDR","Kiksu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LDR/","183 products in account","I think its fair to say I recommend this game as not only has it entered my top 5 games ever, it has a good claim on being the best game I've ever played!  It’s a phenomenally rich and detailed pirate sandbox which takes the typical Assassin's Creed formula (of which I am a fan) but adds a twist.\n\nEdward is a different kind of protagonist for this series.  He's instantly likable as a rogue looking to further his own ends.  But there is depth to the man.  He has a conscience and watching him grow as a character makes for a compelling story.\n\nTechnically I’m amazed by what the developers have managed to do.  The seamless transition between captaining a ship to the traditional Assassin's Creed free-running is incredible.  The simulation of the sea is a marvel as the rolling waves, the wind and storms look and feel amazing.  Make no mistake, if you have the rig to run it this game looks absolutely beautiful.\n\nThere is so much to see and do in this game its almost impossible to get bored, there is such a vast area to explore.  As of right now I think I've clocked 30 hours and I’m just under a third the way through the game.","January 6, 2014","true","90.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gonkish/recommended/242050/","gonkish","Gonk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gonkish/","386 products in account","First of all, if you read my rantview of AC3, you know a lot of what I thought was wrong about it.\n\nThis game basically fixed all of that. It's a much more logical progression of the series than AC3's "here's a bunch of half-baked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that doesn't matter and will be used as a one-off that we don't ever ♥♥♥♥ing explain". There's actually a reason to do things, and -- holy shitballs -- those things are actually ♥♥♥♥ing explained.\n\nI know that Ubi has different teams working on AC. This is the A team's game. The B team made AC3, and ♥♥♥♥ me does it show. This game is everything AC3 should have been, plus it has ♥♥♥♥ing shanties. SHANTIES. SHANTIES ALL OVER THE PLACE.\n\nYes, you're a pirate. Yes, you get a ship. Yes, it's fun to board other ships, steal them, send them to your fleet, etc. Yes, you get to run around stabbing mens from the rooftop. Yes, there's still a modern-day storyline included for no particular reason other than to make you really, really appreciate the REAL game. But shanties are the most important thing in this ♥♥♥♥ing game. There are other things to collect, sure, but SHANTIES. Shanties are to 18th century sailing (AND PIRATES) what ♥♥♥♥ing shooting things is to video games. Inseparable. Natural. Right. SHANTIES.\n\nSeriously, though, the shanties are AWESOME and since you spend so much time sailing around the Caribbean you might as well listen to them. If you don't collect all the shanties you are a bad pirate and I don't like you, but you will also get REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING TIRED of hearing the same handful of shanties over and over again. Collect the shanties both to be the piratey-est pirate that ever pirated things, and to save yourself from hearing Sally Brown about 50,000 times. Shanties.\n\nBeyond SHANTIES, there's actually a good game here. There's hunting, but it's not the stupid, unexplained and utterly useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that it was in AC3. Bonus: it's optional. You can buy the skins needed if you don't want to sail to bumble♥♥♥♥ nowhere to get two monkey hides for whatever the ♥♥♥♥ upgrade you're looking at, when you're just sitting on a pile of ♥♥♥♥ing money. (See, AC3? This ♥♥♥♥ isn't hard, you ♥♥♥♥ing waste. Now go back in the ♥♥♥♥ing corner so I can continue pretending that you don't ♥♥♥♥ing exist.)\n\nThe ship stuff is pretty awesome. The controls are a refined version of what was in AC3, except now there's actually a ♥♥♥♥ing reason to sail the ♥♥♥♥ing ship, unlike "Assassin's Creed Seriously, who the ♥♥♥♥ developed this? A room full of syphilitic monkeys? 3". You get a crazy armament, as well. The Jackdaw (that's your baby) has to be the heaviest-armed brig in the ♥♥♥♥ing world. You get not just your broadsides (which can ultimately be upgraded to have 23 guns per side), but also mortars, fire barrels, and a ♥♥♥♥ing ram. That's right, you can ♥♥♥♥ing ram ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and then rock out like it's the 3rd century BC. By game's end, your little ship is taking out ♥♥♥♥ing full-sized warships that quite literally dwarf you as if it's no big deal. Such is the power of the shanty. Did I mention you can make it pretty? You can make it pretty. Then you can ram ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s some more, while being pretty.\n\nThe only real downside to the ship game is that eventually most of the challenge goes out of it. You can throw money at most of the ship upgrades, but the upper-tier ones are all locked behind a need to find plans scattered throughout the world. Some are found in buried treasure chests -- because what would a pirate game be without buried treasure -- while some come from exploring sunken wrecks. The wreck stuff is, honestly, kind of tedious and occasionally annoying. ♥♥♥♥ sharks, that's all I'm going to say. It's not impossible, and it's not outright bad (*coughAC3huntingcough*), but there's not a hell of a lot to it. The only real variation in the sunken stuff is that you occasionally find a smuggler's cove and then you have to Batman the ♥♥♥♥ out of the bad men in there, because you don't have your full armament. That stuff is pretty cool.\n\nAnyway, back to the ship. Once you gather enough cash, resources (cloth/wood/metal, gained primarily from capturing prizes on the open waves), and plans, your little ship becomes an unstoppable juggernaut that ♥♥♥♥♥ all over every ship on the sea regardless of size or apparent strength. The one exception to this is the "legendary" ships, which are firmly optional. They offer big rewards, but by the time you're strong enough to actually take them on the rewards are utterly meaningless. They exist primarily for bragging rights, and you have to approach each with a particular strategy, so at least there's more depth to them than the standard "poop out doom at the ship until you can board it, then repeat" nature of the naval game later on.\n\nAs a quick aside, it's really ♥♥♥♥ing weird that when you stop to board a ship every other hostile ship just stops attacking you and sort of stands by to watch. Understandable from a gameplay standpoint, but still very odd; doubly so when you realize that you can cripple a ship, wait until you're severely damaged, run back to the crippled ship to board and capture her and then use her to repair your ship back to fighting shape WHILE IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE. It's strange and unrealistic, but I'll give it to them because, hey, at least it's not AC3 (no, I'm not going to stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on AC3 -- ever).\n\nThe story is what it is. I won't spoil anything, other than to say that the protagonist is actually enjoyable and not a huge ♥♥♥♥ing whiny, irrational and wooden ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that anyone with a ♥♥♥♥ing brain would've simply dragged out back and shot in the ♥♥♥♥ing face to save the human race from having to deal with him. Edward is awesome, although his character development, if you don't pay attention to the dates, can seem really oddly paced. Edward is a pirate's pirate. Even the way that he gets involved with the Assassins is awesome, and the completely unnecessary and stupid hours-long intro of AC3 is nowhere to be found. You get some short backstory, then it's PIRATE TIME with PIRATEY PIRATE THE PIRATE as your protagonist. He even ends up seeming human and rational, if self-centered. Dude's a pirate.\n\nAll in all, definitely worth your time.\n\nIncidentally, the first real DLC, Freedom Cry, is also pretty damned good. Not exactly the longest thing, but you get to play as Kenway's quatermaster (read: first mate), Adewale, and he uses a ♥♥♥♥ing machete while running about stabbing men. A machete. There's a kill animation where he hacks it into a man's knee and then LEAVES IT THERE while he punches him in the face. So yeah, worth it if you like the main game, but not terribly long (which is probably a good thing, to be honest).","January 12, 2014","true","54.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimalHunter_779/recommended/242050/","PrimalHunter_779","PrimalHunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimalHunter_779/","383 products in account","Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ is the sixth installment in the Assassin's Creed series; this installment sets out with a new protagonist, setting and other mechanics in order to reinvigorate the series after the somewhat mediocre affair of Assassin's Creed III. I can safely say that Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ is the installment I have enjoyed the most, and will be incredibly appealing to newcomers of the series and long time fans.\nThis time the player is in control of Edward Kenway; legendary pirate and grandfather of Connor from Assassin's Creed III. Edward isn't a member of the Assassin order, and only manages to join their ranks by murdering one of their own and stealing the dead Assassin's garments. Edward's roguish behaviour puts him at odds with the stoic mysticism of the Assassin's, and sets the tone of light hearted pirate adventures in the Caribbean. Edward and his companions are wonderfully voice acted, and are incredibly entertaining to interact with. Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ probably sets the bar for the best narrative of the series, and the change in perspective makes incredibly positive contributions to this.\nGameplay in Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ consists of sailing to various locations, engaging in city exploration, engaging in naval combat, and the usual parkour/sword fights from the other games. Edward's pirate ship, the Jackdaw, allows him to sail between ports such as Havana and Nassau to collect the usual assassination quests, synchronisation towers, collectables and other Assassin's Creed stuff. You can use the Jackdaw to sail to these locations via the open seas, or fast travel via the map menu. On the seas, you can engage in a more refined version of the excellent naval combat from Assassin's Creed III; this consists of using mortars and other ship-based weaponry to completely obliterate enemy vessels or severely damaging them so you can board and steal cargo and passengers. This is incredinly entertaining and it helped to make this installment feel fresh and unique after the relative lack of innovation evident in previous titles. The open-ness of the world in Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ in addition to the encouraged exploration and open ended mission objectives help make this feel like a very unique experience and far more enjoyable to play.\nOn a technical level, Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ satisfies in most areas. The PC optimisation leaves a little to be desired, but the suite of options is perfectly acceptable. The visuals in this game are particularly nice, with special mention going to the excellent foliage, fog, water and lighting effects. This game often looks quite dazzling due to the nice colour palette used in most areas.\nIn conclusion, Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ is an excellent game that has managed to reinvigorate a dying franchise with new mechanics and an exciting story, complete with entertainingly interesting characters. The excellent naval mechanic provides a fascinating new angle complete with awesome upgrades and a wealth of content to work through. I can easily recommend Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ to fans of the series or anyone looking for a great open-world action game.","January 23, 2015","true","17.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

The combat is awesome (Infantry and Naval) and there are some really good elements to the game such as, recruiting pirates, taking over other ships and then choosing what you can do with the wreckage of the ship ( Repair, Destroy and so on) This really does add to the game in an awesome way\n\nThere is a couple of problems involving minor detail for example, The death animations of the guards and enemies are broken...  For example, you kill a guard near a wall and his foot goes through the wall playing the death/execution animation after you have killed him and in order the the corpse to ragdoll it need to go in to the ragdoll physics, in the ragdoll physics you will see that the foot has got cought in the wall and makes the guard glitch out. It's amusing to see but kind of annoying at the same time.\n\nOver all I rate it 8/10 because it is awesome but not perfect. Thank you for reading my review.\n\n","July 20, 2014","true","93.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Most issues you'll encounter have been solved in online forums, so do your homework. Of mention is PhysX. Disable that, even if you have an NVIDIA GPU. It has noticeable memory leaks and degrades game performance substantially, and the effects it enables are very minimal. Again, your mileage may vary.\n\nStory:\n\nThe most epic part of the game, if I may confess. The characters are well developed, and it highlights key cultural notes of the height of piracy in the West indies and the figures of that time (Mary Read , Anne Bony, Black Beard, Calico Jack, etc) and the tumultous events of that period (such as the Maroon uprising, the execution of Calico Jack, the deaths of Mary Read and Black Beard and the role of piracy in shaping up the eventual collapse of  the Pirate republic). All in all, we see the main protagonist, Edward Kenway, grow up from  a rash seafarer to an experienced, self-centered pirate who found his purpose to his calling with the Assasins' and eventual maturity into a legend after Mary Read's death.\nThis storyline and the many hours you'll spend pirating will keep you going back for more, and to be frank, this is probably the most nostalgic Assasins' Creed game in the franchise.\n\nAudio/ Sound work: Excellently done. The music in this game is expertly composed, and the shanties are a timely and welcome addition to the deep, well-crafted in-game environment. Also, quite memorable.\nThe english speakers are quite fluent, and all in all, a high quality recreation of the characters they represent.\n\nGameplay: Reminiscent of Assassins Creed III, the action is split about 60:40 land/sea in missions, and there's a ton of side activities, exploration, assassinations, and naval expeditions to execute in this exhilirating chapter of Assassins Creed. A slight drawback (in my opinion) is that combat , naval expeditions and assassinations feel a bit repetitive compared to the previous Assassins Creed games, and not much innovation has been done to the aging combat system in this franchise. Compared to other free-flow combat games such as Batman Arkham City, this game feels way more immature in that regard, and furtthermore, lowers the game difficulty considerably. A plus on the side is that parkour is flawless, and the emphasis on climbing tall access points for synchronization isn't emphasized much.\n\nThe side content / DLC:\n\nPlaying as Adewale in the Freedom Cry DLC adds extra gameplay and a slight variation in equipment (Machete vs dual-wielded cutlasses and a rudimentary shotgun in place of the dual-wielded pistols from the main game) and a new story line covering the previously un-explored Maroon uprising that is hinted at in the main game via the templar hunt missions. This DLC naturally fills in the gap and adds up to a grand climax at its' end. In a manner, it builds up Adewale's character in a light that we see since his departure from the Jackdaw as the quartermaster and models him into a capable liberator and assassin.\n\nThe element of naval warfare also exists, though with a larger emphasis on liberation and lesser on wanton plunder.\n\nOnline/ Multiplayer:\n\nSelf-descriptive. Prepare to spend much of it on land, though. Take hints from the DLCs in that regard. Your mileage may vary, knowing how unreliable Uplay's network connectivity can be.\nI'm aware console gamers may have a better experience here compared to the PC version.\n\nRecommendations: Get the season pass. Playing as Adewale adds several hours of gameplay (for one) and has its' perks.\nI'lll be playing Assasins Creed for a long time to come.\n\nOverall rating: 10/10 , must - own.","April 19, 2015","true","133.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In other recent Ubisoft games like Watch_Dogs, the HUD was intrusive and confusing as hell. In Black Flag, it's pretty minimal and you can actually tell what is what. Naval combat is great, shooting is great, but melee combat is a little wonky, the game forces you to switch targets and it's annoying. Watch_Dogs being the only other Ubisoft game I own, this is a big step up. In Watch_Dogs, the only interesting thing to do was the main mission, which was bland and mostly consisted of Aiden Pearce talking on the phone and shoving his hands in his pockets like a thug, then sneaking into an abandoned warehouse full of armed hackers and killing everyone. (Which was impossible, even on easy the combat was insanely weighted toward your opponent.) My favorite side mission in AC4 is climbing insanely high buildings and looking out over the beautiful Carribean landscape.\nThings I don't like:\nUplay. Crappy Steam wannabe.\nThe whole thing where the game is just a simulation and nothing is actually real. Great marketing ploy Abstergo.\nLazy animating. A lot of recycled and crappy animations.\nVoice quality: meh.\nLast but definitely not least: LEGENDARY SHIPS MAKE ME WANNA FOJAHIFBWYUONVOWINAIUVDHIUNWOUNFVOWN\n\nOverall, AC4 Black Flag gets a 7.5/10","January 18, 2015","true","47.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With the exception of a little bugginess this game is really well put together. It has all the elements of a great game. Fans of the series plus games like X. It takes the original winning formula and adds in this system where you go around in a pirate ship and blow other boats up for supplies to upgrade your boat and make it more awesome so you can blow up even bigger boats. And THEN it adds in this Kenway's Fleet minigame thing where basically after you blow up a boat (mostly) you can add it to your fleet. The missions take like 10 hours in real time (they go when the game isn't running) and you get money from them and they unlock new missions and stuff. It's just awesome. And THEN you get your own island which you can upgrade for better stores and perks around the world. And THEN it unlocks a series of side quests that tie into the main questline where you save assassins or something but it adds them to every city so you can go back and do these side quests that are each like 4 missions in length. It's just great. I don't want to go outside until I finish it basically and that's going to take forever because all I do is sail a boat and blow stuff up instead of doing quests.","August 20, 2014","true","170.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

If you are a fan of "Sea Legends" (1996) then you might like the naval part too :)\n\nThe storyline is very smooth and involves quite a few plot twists. For the first time, you are not a nobel or a rebel, just a greedy pirate who seeks personal gain in every task. Perhaps one of the most impressive facts about this game is the map size, as in addition to the 3 large cities, you also have access to few dozen small towns/islands and entire sea map that you can travel to conquest ships of unlucky Brits or Spaniards. Though it is a pity that there are no Portugese, Dutch or French ships trespassing the Caribbean sea.\n\nOn cons, you no longer have your recruits to fight for you, but there is a solid reaon for it :) Major downside is the frame rate. Even on a powerful laptop, I have experienced occassional minor frame rate issues, so I would advise to purchase this game for a video console instead. In order to max out the graphics on a PC, I have set the "environmental settings" down to Medium and left the rest at High / Very High. Even though there were no visual bugs, I could not enjoy the small environmental details that would make this game absolutelly superb.\n\nOverall, the game is great and definatelly worth playing! However, Brotherhood remains my favourite game of the series :)","December 7, 2013","true","39.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Laptop's HD5400 can't handle them unfortunately (plus 13.4+ driver shuts off display's backlight for reasons unknown), but it handles enclosed sequences, Aveline DLC and multiplayer.\n\nIt just needs better preferences section - I can't turn off bloom, multiplayer graphic settings don't save at all, MP and SP .exe are separate, but I can't have fancy French voiceover and English voices for SP. PunkBuster service may need some kind of repairing - but it works, I never noticed cheating. It feels like in development game was remade, so software experience was partially forgot so new problems appear.\n\nBut gameplay is awfully addictive, I just got it for multiplayer but was dragged into pirating, I still played half of it ("one more location/mission and I'm done"). Shanties are amazing! Exploring is interesting even with reused  buildings - settlements look way to similiar. There are activities for any taste, and they feel like one whole thing. Aveline DLC was enjoyable (no learning curve bullcrap there, straight to action)\n\nWhat's best for me is multiplayer, it just keeps improving with every game. Now there's Game Lab for costumizing game modes, Assasinate mode, which encourages stealthiness and caution even more. Wolf Pack is like a missing piece - it's both practicing ground and co-op variant.","January 2, 2014","true","107.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But each addition to the series has built on its predecessor, adding interesting new mechanics and hooks (I’m looking at you, Revelations) to help keep things fresh.\n\nBlack Flag places you in the recently liberated boots of Captain Edward Kenway; a rough round the edges, loveable rogue with a quick wit and one thing on his mind. Treasure.  And whist Templar conspiracies and secret wars with assassins are rife in the vast Caribbean ocean, Kenway’s only interested in such affairs for as long as they're profitable. To that end, Black Flag positively encourages exploration and adventure to the point where the main story quickly becomes a secondary concern. Which isn’t to say it’s not worth playing through. In fact, Black Flag’s main narrative is arguably one of the strongest in the franchise. The overall tone is light and humorous (certainly in comparison to the sombre, quest-for-revenge that was ACIII), and there’s not a single character amongst the myriad cast of famous-named swashbucklers that doesn’t feel fleshed-out and well characterised.\n\nThe game also offers an overwhelming number of side activities to indulge in and keep you occupied. Many we’ve already seen in previous ‘Creeds’, but some welcome, themed additions to the roster include whaling, diving, hunting for Mayan treasure and battling with the Caribbean’s  4 ‘Legendary’ enemy ships. But trust me when I say leave fighting them until your endgame.\n\nThe huge world map is revealed incrementally as you travel from island to island, and large sections are filled in with the successful takeovers of heavily guarded forts. These effectively act as synchronisation points for the overworld map; highlighting nearby towns, islands and explorable shipwrecks, as well as a plethora of other pirate collectables. And it’s well worth taking to time to collect them. Building materials and plans are needed to upgrade and customise the Jackdaw. And you’ll need plenty of Reyals to kit Kenway out with new gear if you want to stand a chance late in the game.\n\nYou’ll soon find however, that some of Black Flags most enjoyable moments come from travelling between the Caribbean’s various points of interest. Naval combat has been refined and perfected from its role as a side-quest in ACIII, and now features the ability to board and takeover enemy ships.\nThe feeling of broadsiding a British man-o-war in the middle of a typhoon, before swinging onto the deck and wreaking havoc with a bandolier full of flintlocks, is one that’s seriously hard to beat. Throw in a heroic, Hollywood-esque score (composed by Iron Man 3s, Brian Tyler), and you’ve got an experience as close to being in a Pirates of the Caribbean film as you could ever hope for.\n\nEven out of combat; the sounds of the ocean, distant cannon-fire and sea-shanties chorused by the Jackdaw’s crew, make for a scenic and atmospheric ride. Although your ships ability to magically vacuum up any floating loot and sailors that drift by, does little for the immersion. Of course, the games various glitches and bugs don’t help much either. All too often your high-profile free-run controls will send you jumping sideways onto a path you didn’t necessarily want to go down, and A.I musketeers have an unerring ability to hit you even when you’re behind cover. But these are minor issues in an engine that’s otherwise seriously impressive.\n\nIn short, Assassin’s creed Black Flag is a tremendous technical achievement and arguably the best in the series to date. Stunning visuals, impressive sound design and fast-paced, free-flow combat make for an engaging and immersive experience. Upgrading the Jackdaw and Kenway, adds a satisfying RPG element and there’s some excellent scope for customisation. The story is well paced and quick to get going, although certain mission types soon start to feel repetitive. But if and when you get bored, there’s always something else to do. Whether that’s hunting elusive white whales to craft Kenways next costume, or trying to unearth buried treasure with only a hand-scrawled map for direction; the important thing is that you have the freedom to choose. And surely that’s what being pirates all about.\nWell… that and treasure.\n\nYo Ho!","December 6, 2013","true","35.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Builds on most of the mechanics of the previous games, while also fleshing out some of the half finished ideas from Assassin's Creed III (hunting, sea combat, etc) and making them actually fun and useful.\n\nThe story is good. Edward's journey is a good one. The writing and voice acting are all well done, and there are some memorable characters.\n\nThe 'ground' gameplay is  very much more of the same Assassin's Creed that your'e probably already used to if you are considering this. If you weren't a fan of stabbing dudes, climbing to viewpoints, parkouring all over the place, etc then you probably still will not enjoy this part of the game. It's not challenging, really, but it's fun.\n\nThe sea combat is surprisingly good. Cannons are all handled well (and you have quite a few varieties). Your ship can be upgraded with better armor, cannons, new types of cannons, etc. You can board or sink ships, take their treasure or commandeer them for your fleet (sort of like the Brotherhood 'minigame' from the previous games). Well done and very fun. Sailing the high seas is made even better by the sea shanties you collect for your pirate crew to sing.\n\nThere are quite a bit of side objectives to complete, some old and some new. Assassin missions, collectables, and chests are all still present. New challenges include harpooning whales, naval battles, and capturing forts (sort of like capturing templar bases in the older games). I 92%ed my save, and it took me about 40 hours. I imagine it'd be about 50 if you wanted to 100% it. Maybe a bit less.\n\nI was a fan of the modern components of the previous Assassin's Creed games, even though I understand that a lot of other people were not. A new tangent of the modern story is present in this game, and it's handled in a slightly different way. If you were not a fan, there's probably 15-30 minutes of 'modern' gameplay that you are forced to do, and the rest is optional. If you're into the series/lore, there are a lot of different tidbits you can find that relate back to previous games, future games, etc. Pretty cool.\n\nOverall, great game. Highly recommended even if you haven't played previous Assassin's Creed games, and even more so if you have and liked them.","April 2, 2014","true","40.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Not being bogged down with the weight of the assassins from day 1 is a refreshing change of pace. and the freedom to hit the seas and have a crack at who ever and whatever crosses your path is great.\n\nHitting locations simply for the hell of it is great also, i spent the first 30 hours just sailing about picking stuff up, going to islands and boarding ships.\n\nAlso the stealth thing is back, ACBF makes you think about attack plans whilst trying to assault a castle or takedown a target, no more running headlong into a target, hitting him hard, then diving into the sea......no no you need your thinking caps and paitience.\n\nAll in all i have enjoyed this greatly, and the plot although not quite so grand is facinating, and you feel that you could leave it to explore without making it feel unimportant.\n\nOnly downside is the whole animus thing, being kicked from your pirate adventures to walk about an office for the "actual" story is frustrating. and i feel that the AC games suffer from that.\n\nBut all in all BRILLIANT\n","April 25, 2014","true","78.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

With the exception of a little bugginess this game is really well put together. It has all the elements of a great game. Fans of the series plus games like X. It takes the original winning formula and adds in this system where you go around in a pirate ship and blow other boats up for supplies to upgrade your boat and make it more awesome so you can blow up even bigger boats. And THEN it adds in this Kenway's Fleet minigame thing where basically after you blow up a boat (mostly) you can add it to your fleet. The missions take like 10 hours in real time (they go when the game isn't running) and you get money from them and they unlock new missions and stuff. It's just awesome. And THEN you get your own island which you can upgrade for better stores and perks around the world. And THEN it unlocks a series of side quests that tie into the main questline where you save assassins or something but it adds them to every city so you can go back and do these side quests that are each like 4 missions in length. It's just great. I don't want to go outside until I finish it basically and that's going to take forever because all I do is sail a boat and blow stuff up instead of doing quests.","August 20, 2014","true","170.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Ubi continued to march out their yearly cash machine and I was amazed at how they seemed content to just keep making the same game over and over again.\n\nThen........\nBlack Flag happened.\n\nNow up to that point Sid Meyers Pirates had come pretty close to being the perfect pirate game and people always had that to fall back on if they felt the sudden urge to scream "Arrgh Matey" while gaming . With the release of Black Flag the perfect pirate game had been accomplished, and what was infinetly more important was that the ridiculous Assassins storyline had been abandoned for a classic pirate tale (albeit one where Edward Kenway just didn't give a sh!t about the Assassins or Templars and just wanted to do some proper piracy).\n\nAs far as having to give the game a score to reflect my feelings about it, I would say half point deducted just for being an Assassins game (it should have just been a new IP called "Black Flag" and it could have been the new yearly milking machine on its own), and another half point deducted just for that stupid immersion breaking "lets go back to the game developers office for the most galactically stupid side story ever" sequences, leaving it with a solid 9/10.\n\nThe naval warfare and ship boarding alone could have been it's own game, but with everything else it was the magnus opus of the Assassins Creed series.\n\nThen they went back to being stupid again for the following 4 games.\nLife is weird eh?","February 8","true","80.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Not because it's an Assassin's Creed game but because it is an Assassin's Creed game wrapped inside Pirate Simulator 2013. I liked Sid Meier's Pirates and this game takes the concept to a whole new level. There is SO much to do.\n\nPros\n- Sea battles\n- You can board ships\n- You can capture these ships and send them to your fleet\n- You have a fleet which incorporates its own mini game. You can send our fleet's ships to mission to gain resources and money but first you need to secure the trade routes by doing mini sea battles.\n- You can go whaling and kill sharks\n- You can explore islands from tiny to huge in size and kill the local fauna for resources.\n- You can find things like smuggler dens and dive to sunken ships to find treasures and treasure maps.\n- I'm not quite sure on this yet but it seems like you can assault whole cities and take them for your own.\n- Upgrade your ship\n- Upgrade your character\n\nNeutrals\n- Tons of collectibles and unlockables. Love them or hate them...\n- You need to progress the story to be able to do everything listed above.\n\nCons\nAt its core it's still an Assassin's Creed game. That of course doesn't automatically make it bad, but:\n- Uplay\n- Very sticky and at times sluggish ground movement. Your character constantly tries to grab on to or step on any possible thing he can find. Chasing something? Better jump on some random post and and squat for a few seconds instead of just running on the street like a normal person.\n- As soon as you step foot onto any roof, you will be hunted by ten or more guards who want to stab, shoot and generally murder you in cold blood for...being on a roof.\n- Silly bugs but nothing game breaking for me so far.","May 20","true","36.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

So much to love and enjoy about this game. It's definitely refreshing how they mixed the ship combat & boarding with the solid Assassin's Creed foundation. It reminds me a bit about the amount of fun I had with Sid Meier's Pirates back in the day which is definitely a good thing. It's definitely my favorite Assassin's Creed game yet.\n\nSide missions / activities are pretty good and varied... Deep sea diving, Animal hunting on land and at sea, Assassin Missions, Trader Missions, searching for Mayan puzzle pieces, Templar key hunts... Lots to do.\n\nOne of my favorite little side activities is collecting "Shanties" which is songs the Pirates sing... and each Shanty you collect? Your crew learns a new song! A game where collecting things adds more fun to the game indirectly and in a good way!? Awesome. :P\n\nOn PC it was optimized incredibly well compared to even Skyrim even with packing more detail on screen. :)\n\nThe only poor part is the controls when diving underwater and a current carries you... can't spin the camera and know what Edward's skull is about to bounce off of lol... only other control issue? Parcour. The classic controls of Right click enables parcour and Shift increases the running speed is sorely missed here. Sometimes it's hard to tell Edward which way you wish for him to move with just WASD, that and if you're trying to make a tight manuver (ie, Climbing the masts to cut down a Ship's flag) Edward will think you meant leaping somewhere else instead of 90 degree turn and climb the Mast some more. :(\n\nOverall? Even with a few control flaws? It's still my favorite Assassin's Creed game to date... Definitely worth the money, especially if it's on sale. :)","March 28, 2014","true","58.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

AC3 was a huge disappointment after the AC2 trilogy, with massively scaled-back mechanics, a painfully wooden main character, a ridiculously obtuse trading simulator, and a plot that was so disjointed it felt like a David Lynch movie. There was one key redeeming factor however... The boat.\n\nThen along comes AC4. "You like boats!? We've got boats for days son!

The entire story feels arbitrary and half-told, and the "climax" was far from satisfying, leading the end of the game to feel abrupt, as if it ended early to accomodate more DLC.  Issues that have dogged the series have only gotten worse, with ground combat being the worst I have seen yet.  I don't think I've ever played a game where I felt simultaneously more powerful and incredibly weak, but they have managed to somehow pull that off.  It also bears, in my opinion, several strong resemblances to Far Cry 3 while failing to capture any of the uniqueness of that game.  Hunting and scrounging for materials to craft upgrades, weird visions where you're forced to walk really slowly by people from your past as they rage at you, taking over enemy forts to give yourself fast travel locations - fans of the tedious parts of FC3 will be very happy with this title.\n\nDespite buying the game in Steam, it plays in Ubisoft's terrible Uplay, which requires a separate account and tracks achievements separately.  Buying a large pack of DLC here on Steam therefore requires manually copy/pasting each individual code over into Uplay, which is cumbersome and unnecessary.\n\nMy playthrough was also plagued with lost savegames, which a quick search shows has been an issue known to Ubisoft for several months and has received no attention, resulting in the loss of about two dozen hours of playtime.  Despite Uplay's "always on" cloud syncing of savegames, I was able to lose entire sessions with no real warning on multiple occasions.  Ubisoft forum denizens offer a workaround for this issue in the form of a batch file to back up your savegames (I did not try this), but the fact that Ubisoft has failed to resolve this issue several months after a botched launch reflects extremely poorly on their further involvement in the title.\n\nGone is the ability to recruit new assassins, replaced by the ability to create a trading fleet managed in a minigame instead (The less said about this new minigame the better).  I suppose this is due to the fact that Edward isn't actually an assassin until the end of the game, and while he occasionally works with them his ends seem mostly at odds with theirs throughout the game.\n\nIn the plus column - this game is gorgeous and there is no way to overstate that.  Every sightline falls on something just beatifully done.  This game also has some of the great jumping and climbing puzzles that has made the series great, and collectibles are very liberally sprinkled all over the place, which made for a lot of fun until I lost an entire day of collecting due to a savegame corruption as mentioned above.\n\nThe overall impression I felt while playing was less like I was playing AC4, and more like I was playing a reskinned AC3.","January 13, 2014","false","290.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/billyazad/recommended/242050/","billyazad","billy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/billyazad/","98 products in account","Well, how can I start with the wonderment that is Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag. Launching the game for the first time, I had my fair share of doubt, coming fresh from ACIII, with III's ambition but failure to embrace the roots of the franchise in the slightest, if at all. So one can only imagine how sceptical I must have been of Ubi's promise with ACIV, but something grabbed me about the game even before playing it. I was excited Darby McDevvit was writing another AC story, because his work on Revelations was nothing short of a masterpiece in pacing and execution (in my personal opinion). And the fact much of Far Cry 3's team moved over to the dev team for ACIV, making it a game that had that sense of sureness about it, a sense of a development team that knows what they're delivering, fully.\n\nAbout the story in ACIV. As much as very little of your time is spent in the modern day segments, it still plays a huge part of the game. It has now, in fact, become a canvas for pretty much an infinite (depending on Ubi) number of future AC titles. But i'll not delve into too many details at risk of spoiling anything for you all. You are the main character, and assume the role of a voiceless, faceless Abstergo employee. This first person identity approach makes for a much personal experience, and I found myself getting personally attached to the character I was controlling, simply because there was a sense of "me" giving the character the identity.\n\nEdward Kenway's saga. Well, what can I say, you are thrust so quickly into the shoes of Captain Edward Kenway, that you don't even get the chance to yell "Half Sail Lads!" (heuheuheu ;) ). It is essentially full sail and your away in this game, which is leaps and bounds from what you may remember from ACIV's prequel only but a year ago!\n\nThe game's sense of progression in Edward's character as he advances through the lengthy campaign is absolutely astonishing, and you can't help but grow attached to the witty, hot-tempered, selfish, arrogant Pirate in Captain Edward Kenway, no matter how much of a bad person he may be by anyone's defenition.\n\nIf you were worried that they're taking the series away from the roots, you can discard all those worries. In my opinion, using a single protagonist to play Assassins off Templars and vice versa makes this, in some areas, the more "Assassin's Creed" a game than any of its predecessors. It forces you to question each side, their goals, method of achieving them. And staying away from the typical biased good guy character forced to join the "good guys" makes for interesting plot moments throughout!\n\nThe ending is satisfying and conclusive, and you are teased with enough bits of info throughout the modern day to keep you questioning about the next games in the franchise, but as for ACIV's story alone, it concludes in, probably, the most satisfying manner I've seen a game conclude, reminding me personally of the likes of Max Payne 3 and McDevvit's previous AC, Revelations.\n\nTake down forts and make them your own for the pirates, take part in Assassin hunts, Templar hunts, complete Assassination contracts, chase Shanties for your crew, collect data fragments, loot chests, find treasure maps, go treasure hunting, loot underwater shipwrecks, harpoon a variety of sea beasts for hunting goods, ranging from Whales to Bull sharks, complete naval contracts with each new fort you've taken over.. The variety of things you can do in this game is insane, and it gives me faith the Ubisoft Montreal are finally starting to deliver on their promise of ambition in open world games, whether that's only in the AC franchise, or otherwise!\n\nVisually, the game is drop dead gorgeous, no questions asked, very little texture pop-in occuring, and there is the occasional drop in frame rate, but this only really occurred for me when sailing into heavy smoke during naval battles. The game has remained a stable PC version, and at no point has it made me wonder whether it was just "ported over" (though Next-Gen makes that easier to get away with now, hehe ;) )\n\nBoth land and naval combat have been streamlined, but not simplified! Naval combat is straightforward to get to grips with, and incredibly satisfying once you've gotten a taste of boarding and pillaging ships, and subsequently upgrading the Jackdaw.\nA deep upgrading system surrounding Edward and the Jackdaw make for excellent exploration ventures that are almost always fun, over the top and satisfying. Land combat is far more tricky this time, with slightly modified archetypes than we're used to, and the fact that guards no longer wait for you to finish killing their buddy before they attack you, so quick counters, breaking defences and great positioning make for satisfying kill streaks, on ship and land!\n\nMultiplayer is back and with few improvements, but whether this is positive or negative is up to you, I see it as a winning formula that's being maintained. Same great cat and mouse gameplay, perks etc etc. With the addition of the game lab, which I can assure you, is as in-depth as promised. If you digged the multiplayer in the previous AC titles, you'll have the same, if not more of a blast playing through AC multiplayer-Black Flag edition (my name for it ;) )\n\n\nWell, that concludes my review for this excellent, excellent game, I can only wish everyone else on this planet could have experienced it with me! :')\n\nI give Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag a solid : 10/10 !

Here's why I don't like it:\n\n1) The controls are fiddly: There has been a few times when I was in combat and I just didn't have control over Edward. Example, I would be fighting a group of 3-4 guys and when they got in close range, I couldn't move away and couldn't fight back either. Even when you're not in combat, running/climbing all over the environment can be tricky in places!\n\n2) Graphics problems: The graphics are consistantly going weird on me. It becomes totally unplayable. If you want to see what I mean, please feel free to have a look at some screenshot's I've taken. You'll see what I mean!\n\nUPDATE: Here are links to the screenshots:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=202976713\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=201027543\n\n3) Gameplay can be generally frustrating: I must admit, I can't remember if AC has a selectable difficulty as it was a while since I started the game, but I ALWAYS start on easy mode on the first playthrough of every game I buy, just to get the hang of it and then move up after. But I'm still on my first playthrough and can be waaaaay to hard. The number of times I've actually got super angry is unreal. Avoid this game if you have anger issues/prone to high blood pressure. You may just suffer a stroke!\n\nFinally, I think it's such a shame. I had really high hopes for this game and really did enjoy it for a little while, and the one good point is that the storyline is pretty good and sucks you in, but knowing what I now know, I really regret buying this now! I know Steam says I'm entitled to only 1 refund, this may just be the one time I exercise that right!\n\nAvoid like the plague!","December 11, 2013","false","37.5"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

Rum and suger can be sold to get even more money.\nWhen you destroy enough ships you will get more wanted stars, the more stars you get the stronger pirate hunters will be spawned, and they will hunt you until you manage to remove the stars.\n\nThe seas are vast and there is loads of stuff to do, be it gathering mayan secrets for something to be revealed, or following treasure maps and finding your treasure. And don't worry, after completing the main story you can still sail around and do these things.\n\nAnd if you are done with the main story or everything, what I love to do is to put on some epic Pirates of the Carribean music while sailing!\n\nHowever this is still an Assassin's Creed game, so you will still be doing missions quite similar to the previous games. Like "Tail the target", "eavesdrop the conversation", "kill target", "escape area and become anonymous" and so forth. But there are also missions where you sail with your ship to destroy another enemy ship.\n\nThe main story is worth completing, because it is really entertaining and you will meet many interesting and cool characters, the ending was to me quite touching in different ways.\nIf you (like me) doesn't like the "new futuristic world" where you sit in a machine, then there is both a positive and negative side.\nThe negative side is that you are in a kind of machine.\nThe positive side is that they have removed many of the animations inside the world where it continously remind you that you are not in the world, in the previous games you would see things manifest around you like you were in a machine, you don't see it as much in this game. And you are only drawn out of the world about 5 times.\nSo because of this I feel that this is an improvement.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone that is interested in the pirate life, sailing around in your own ship, fighting the royal navy or pirate hunters! This is without a doubt my favorite Assassin's Creed game so far!","December 10, 2013","true","45.1"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

Though overall mapsize is bigger.\n\nThe best part is out on sea imho. The battles you can have there are just amazing. It all depends on the upgrade system,\nif you're able to take on three Man'O'Wars or not :D\nIn the beginning, even some smaller ships can sink you in seconds xD\nAnd cruising around the sea, while listening to your pirate singing shanties, is just awesome (Leave her Johnny leave her...)\n\nFighting is still overpowered, but enemies can hit you easier, then in previous titles, which is a plus imho.\n\nFreerunning is as awesome as always, but can be clunky sometimes, but that's mostly yourself being to hectic with the controls :D\n\nAnd the pirate theme just fits so great into this setting, honestly go buy this if you like AC titles, and if you don't liked them before, start with this!","November 27, 2013","true","64.3"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","5"

Tailing someone to a spot to kill them, eavesdropping on a conversation to learn of a spot to kill them, or just killing your target directly seem to be the bread and butter of this series and it's all a bit stale now.  None of it takes advantage of their really amazing open world, more freedom in mission design would really benefit the next game.\n\nI love the "real world" narrative in this one as well, while the story itself is thin the setup for the next game is really open ended with Abstergo Entertainment at the helm.  Really creative and man, they could do some amazing things with that in the future.  Do all the side stuff and enjoy the open world as a pirate, leave the main story missions for last as they are mainly a chore to get through.","January 20, 2014","true","248.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are beautiful and gameplay is smooth as it has ever been. The story is great and you don't have to play half the game to play the main character *cough* AC3.

Take AC3's map and times it by 10. I have so much more to do in the game and I can't wait!!

I didn't ike the whole pirate concept because I just didn't think sailing around would be that fun...man i was wrong. This game is fillied with so much to do. From infiltrating forts, to destroying and boarding ships. Finding artrifacts to unlock new and unique armour. Stealthly taking out assassination targets, hunting, enjoying the improved and incredibl fluid freerunning, going underwater into hidden caves, building your own fleet and much more. The combat may be easy, but still very satifisying. Stealth in this game is challenging and fun when pulled off right. This game is probably the 2nd best assassins creed game out there after 2.

Mind you, I haven't played any AC games before, so I was a bit skeptical of spending a full $60 on it. However, one hour into the game was all it took for me to realize I was wrong. I love the Caribbean setting and everything the developers added to immerse the player. The characters were also very lovable, and they made the storyline amazing. All the sidequests and missions were incredibly fun, but some became a little tedious. If I'm on the topic of complaining, I might as well include that this was a very poor console port, being locked at 30 FPS.

Assassin's Creed 4 takes the whole franchise to a new level by adding an exciting naval combat system. You never get bored of playing as there is such a varity of things to do. Combat is a little glitchy at times especially while boarding. The story admittedly falls short and is lackluster compared to Assassin's Creed 2 or even Revalations. Graphics (provided you have a decent graphics card) are stunning. Community challenges allow you to compete with the community in certain objectives which adds a nice competative element to the single-player. The naval combat and the many side quests and explorable areas more than make up for the game's shortcomings. Overall amazing game that will keep you hooked for quite some time.\n9.5/10","February 8, 2014","true","90.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Was it worth the delay you ask?\n\nAssassin's Creed 4 is a prequel (of sorts) to Assassin's Creed 3 in which you play as Connor's grandfather Edward Kenway a notorious pirate, Edward is an absolute delight to play as, he is quickly becoming a personal favourite of mine, all the old gameplay factors have transferred over from the previous installments, unfortunately this means evasdrop missions and tailing missions make a return, they still bring forth annoyances, optional objectives are back from those suffering from OCD and wish to 100% the game.\n\nThe sailing and sea exploration is the main feature of this game. And by god is it amazing. From small boats to giant warships they all carry prescious recources that are required to upgrade your ship, and believe me they're needed if you wish to be in control of the Caribbean, ship controls and battles have been tweaked and tightened since Assassin's Creed 3, they now feel bigger and more intense, the controls feel more responsive so that you can react to these manic battles.\n\nThe story is still top notch and full on. Voice acting is ace, and the new present day parts are intriguing if slightly dull compared to that of Desmond's final journey in the previous installment.\n\nFinal Verdict: This game is worth every penny you pay for it, with countless hours of fun out of the story and a thrill ride of a story. 9/10","November 28, 2013","true","32.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Maintaining and upgrading a ship is surprisingly well integrated with the usual Creed city-style gameplay.\n\nBoth the vast open ocean and bustling cities provide ample amusement for any type of gamer.\n\nEdward charms audiences with his carefree attitude, the antithesis of the previous installment's Connor (who couldn't seem to get past his persistent anger and upset) - Edward loves what he does and never wears his Neuroses - though it is always very clear that he has a larger purpose.\n\nCombat is refined and we finally, at long last, have free-aim while dealing with projectile weaponry. Swashbuckling with two swords is an absolute blast and boarding ships after raining mortar fire, chain shot and broadsides upon your enemy is a delght. The crew sings dynamically on long voyages, fights alongside you during vessel captures and cheers when you take the helm.\n\nAs usual, there's a lot to do - and along with that comes a main plotline that resembles a B action flick. The Abstergo sequences have been completely overhauled to better guide us through the meta-story without jarring us with hours of interruption. Though they're still as tacky as ever.\n\nThe abundance of follow/stalking "memories" are a bummer but are far more generous with checkpoints and feature more dynamic side objectives than prior titles. Obnoxious? Yes, but refined with a new targeting system and slew of gadgetry that make the segments at the very least more interesting.\n\nAll that being said, there's no one real reason to buy this game, but instead, a long list of lovely features Ubisoft Montreal seems to improve with every launch that make this Creed game a must.\n\nBuy this game because it's a labor of love, pick it up because it's absolutely gorgeous and represents the type of AAA game that comes to PC without skipping a beat.","November 25, 2013","true","254.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Admittedly 3 was a recent low point in the Assassin's Creed games, and 4 borrows a lot from it but honestly I think it's returning to the days of Brotherhood in terms of quality.  The main aspect of this game is the naval combat feature pioneered in 3, and it's been improved upon.  This time you're a pirate and you can ravage and loot any ship you come across.  You're confined to a square of ocean with islands scattered about but it has plenty of side missions on those islands.  You can hunt wildlife (but you don't have to) and you can create a fleet of pirate ships to do naval missions for you (similar to the assassin missions in the prior 3 games).\nThe story may not be as engaging as the original base games (and let's be honest, that's been a problem in the past few AC games) but in terms of fun, this game is quite that.  My one complaint, however, is that it tends to crash on me at least once every playing session and I cannot figure out why.","December 23, 2013","true","162.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is great and the main charcter Edward Kenway is awesome hes a mix between the ladys man smooth talker Ezio is and the rough thugish figure that is Conner. One thing that sets this game apart is the motives Edward isnt doing these things for honor or glory or because it the right thing to do, his only motive is money and you see that in him during the main story. I would give this game a 9/10 because the only thing keeping this from being a perfect game is well the Assassins Creed parts this would have been much better as just a pirate game. I liked the new touch that they added with the exsploration of Abstergo Entertainment insted of the whole Desmond Miles thing but It was very boring and I would really have liked it better if I could just skip it entirely and go back to being a pirate. Another thing is the old Assassins Creed missions. I loved beinging a pirate and raiding plantations that was new and something that I think people will like to do but the old stalk this guy or evesdrop on this person was very annoying a something that was old and boring a long time ago.

The new climbing or free running, that had been simplified in number 3 has showed itself once again proving to be fun and easy.\n\nFlowing sword play and explosive cannon battles are but icing of the cake for this game.\n\nStory: As always the writers at Ubisoft have written a masterpiece, the story seemed to have no strange or abrupt periods. Running smoothly and being the meat on the bones for the story lovers.\n\nSea Battles: One thing I personally liked about number 3 was the fact we could sail, but I also found a distinct lack of instances where we could go sailing. Through out the whole game sailing is a major player and extremely fun to do, commanding naval ships from schooners to mana’ wars and taking forts for the black flag is both exciting and productive being one of the best ways to make money in the game.\n\nGraphics: An amazing game when it comes to graphics, texture detail is great and maps are vast with few loading screens NOTE: I am running the game on max settings with every effect enabled on a 1440 x 900 HD resolution screen, my view may be different than yours.\n\n\nNegative:\n\nGame play: there are instances where freerunning will fail or you are aiming and try running doing this will fire what ever weapon you are using.\n\nStory: I honestly can’t think of anything I would prefer to change.\n\nSea battles: When you're not aiming you fire a usable heavy shot no matter what.\n\nGraphics: Tasking on your system, recommend having a high end gaming computer for advanced graphics NOTE: The next gen games such as this and cod ghosts run massively different on almost the exact same systems.\n\n\nConclusion: MAKE SURE YOU CAN RUN THIS GAME BEFORE YOU BUY! The AC4SP.exe can have crash problems here are some links that helped me fix it http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-1827759.html\n\nhttp://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/727484-AC3SP-exe-Has-stopped-Working-Forums\n\nNOTE: multiple fixes may need to be applied.\n\n\nPersonal Score: 8.5/10\n\nHaving to instal the uplay is very annoying and the lack of a fix for the AC4SP.exe (may be fixed by the time this is out) is also concerning. As a long time fan of the franchise I see nothing wrong with the game itself just issues that are unresolved and annoying boot things like uplay.","January 17, 2014","true","109.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No other Assassins' Creed game has really touched on this before. You can travel all around the carribean either on land or by the ocean, all the while passing ships, fleets, sharks, whales, sunken treasure, pirates, bounty hunters, etc. This game has alligator fights! It has privateering! It has shanties! And the best thing about it is: you aren't forced into focusing on the story the whole game! Probably around 90% of the game is NON story...\n\nThe shipfaring is a big part of the game which is well thought out. You really feel like you're controlling your crew through an epic battle and the struggle feels real. Boarding ships is easy and the game does a great part of transitioning into a boarding from a fight. It never gets old! Probably half of my played time is sailing around and plundering ships.\n\nOne bad thing about the game is that it doesn't have a lot of assassinations... but honestly who cares? The least fun parts in the game in my opinion were when I was forced to sneak around in the shadows instead of staggering up to my foes and shooting them in the face like a proper pirate.\n\nCaveat: I haven't played an Assassin's Creed game since Assassin's Creed II. So I wouldn't call myself a die hard fan.\n\n","January 18, 2014","true","57.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play as a pirate of the Caribbean who doesn't really fit in with the Assassins or Templars.  He basically just does what he wants and what he wants is money and gold.  You command a ship around in a big open world with hardly any loading.  One of the things that I was amazed by is how you can essentially stop sailing a ship, jump into the ocean, swim to islands, and continue playing on foot with the standard Assassin's Creed gameplay.  Fast travel has been improved greatly this game and is pretty much necessary as everything is so spread out.  One of the great things is each of the synchronization points become fast travel points and you can go to them immediately through the map menu.  You don't have to go to a fast travel point to fast travel.  Hunting and crafting makes its return and it's way more fun.  They got rid of setting traps and bait.  Instead, you just shoot the animal with your gun and it's over with.  Sword play is essentially the same as before.  Gun play has changed from the previous games I believe.  You can now control where you aim instead of auto locking.  If you're a fan of Assassin's Creed and Sid Meier's Pirates, you will enjoy this game.","January 8, 2014","true","88.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It almost looks like new entire installment, even I wondered why there's no separate installment "Black Flag" instead AC4: Black Flag. Either way, AC4: Black Flag is good in its own way different from previous installment.\n\nFor some people who wants to enjoy Assassin's Creed story but too lazy or didn't want spend time completing previous installment, AC4 is a good start. But of course, it'll be more enjoyable if one has completing AC and AC Legacy.\n\nFinal Verdict (w/o DLC):\n8.2/10","December 3, 2013","true","129.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I got hit by it pretty early, in the middle of AC2 and never finished another AC past that one. I love the gameplay in AC but apart from the main missions, most of the things that can be done are repetitive tasks that always end up feeling like a grind (and I've got a high tolerance for repetitive gaming tasks but they have to be at least a little fun). Another criticism is that AC never provided any opportunities to create your own fun like you would expect out of an open world so if you don't like the activities it offers, there's nothing else to do.\n\nAC4 has all of these issues, but for some reason it's still a pretty good game. I did not get hooked right away but once I got far enought to be able to freely roam the open world with the ship, it became a pretty amazing experience that no other game has ever done. The naval battles are simply amazing.  It feels more like the ultimate pirate simulator than an AC game. It's something that has to be experienced. I finished the main story but I am compelled to continue playing because there is still a crap load of fun to be had with the open world piracy. I just wish they had made the naval warfare part of the multiplayer.","May 20, 2014","true","138.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Assasin's Creed IV Black Flag feels like a revitalization of the franchise. It is truly a remarkable experience set in a caribbean atmosphere and centered around pirate lore. The game has numerous addictive qualities that keep pulling me back for more. Sailing the high seas in conquest and search for treasures never gets boring. Upgrading your ship and battling ever increasingly difficult numberrs of foes keeps you on the egde of your seat.\n\nThe graphics and sound here are truly spectacular, and without taxing your computer hardware. I really can't recommend this game enough. If you enjoyed any of the previous Assasin's Creed games or haven't played them but have an interest in pirate lore, this game is an easy no brainer.

This means that I have to squint.\nAnd this wouldn't be so bad were it not that, even when I change my desktop resolution to match, it stays bordered.\nI initially refunded this game, but I'm willing to give it a shot with some tinkering.

This is a pretty damn fun iteration of an AC game. Best game I can compare it to right now is Mad Max. The combat is pretty meh, the story/development is decent, but the best part is roaming the open world collecting things and destroying everything in your path. Basically mad max (the game) on the ocean.\n\nI can't name any other game where i've gotten to control my own ship in an open world setting, at least none that were memorable. This game lets you have your own ship with a lot of weapons/upgrades/customization, and you can take it just about anywhere and do anything.

You guys know it, im sure everyone has tried one of the games in the series at some point.\n\nThe story for this one is very interesting, Ubisoft seems to have changed gameplay up and made the game far more open world.  So you have the normal Assassins creed, parkour mixed with hack and slash fighting mechanics with a good and interesting storyline of the battle through the ages of the templars vs the assassins.\nThe story is solid making reference to historical characters and events, you even meet the real life characters that made piracy so compelling as a storyline throughout the ages.\n\nAfter playing through this i feel that it was a much stronger game than every other Assassins creed game i played and i own the entire series.\nWhat did i like about it?\n\nThe storyline while starting off dragging its heels a little was very interesting it almost felt like a movie to me.\nCharacters were fantastic i loved them all, the voice actors did a fine job.\nThe actual fighting on land was typical of any Assassins creed game here nothing new i found this average at best.\nShip to ship combat and travel was immense, this was the most interesting part for me at least.  Braving a tropical storm at sea while in a battle firing cannons at an enemy ship was breathtaking.  I enjoyed the fact you could attack any ship you wanted i felt this made the game more open and enjoyable.\nShip upgrades were a much needed addon and ubisoft delivered on this.  No more running from a battle with a larger more powerful ship later on in the game once you have the upgrades needed to take down such ships.\nThe deck battles after weakening a ship i found better than the land battles as it just felt right for the the time and location and scenario of the game.\n\nThe side missions as usuall were and interesting touch and i found myself constantly starying from the main story to chase these and complete them while not ruining my enjoyment of the game at all.\n\nThe graphics and sound effects were excellent but you can expect the same movements and similar textures to previous titles but dont be put off ubisoft once again have done a great job makign everything and everyone look good.\n\nWhat i didnt like...\n\nAverage land combat although the flint lock pistols added some fun it can get repetetive quite fast and i found myself itching to get back on the water to take down a man o war spanish warship everytime.\n\nThe story seemed somewhat short, this is usually a case with most Assassins creed games they seem to end the story rather short.\n\nAll in all i enjoyed this game.  It was a very different approach to what im used to with the Assassins creed series and what i would say if you are considering this game its a no brainer really to just buy it and play through it at least once.\n\nThat rounds up my review i'll give this one 8 out of 10.","January 17","true","40.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Very... interesting series for me to talk out. They start releasing a game a year on main gen consoles and PC since 2009, hell, they released two back in 2014, Unity and Rogue, and I guess they do it this year again. Heck, they could be releasing even more a year. What I am saying, ladies and gentlemen, is that this game makes Call of Duty jealous from the ridiculous releases each year. So, to quell our possible uprisings, Ubisoft decided to say, "We are sorry to hear that you are unsatisfied. Would you like an awesome pirate adventure?" The unanimous answer to that was, "...well now we do!" Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, which is not the fourth game but I would go nuts for counting up what game it actually is probably, is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome without a doubt, and is probably the best of the franchise, though I've only played this game twice, half of 3 and part of 2. Not very much, yeah, but this game is awesome. Want to know why? Of course you do, or else you wouldn't be reading this. So let's get into it, shall we?\n\nSTORY: Your name is Edward Kenway. Actually, you're some guy who works at a video game development place that uses Desmond Miles's DNA to both make games and  benefit the Templar order, but most of you only give a ♥♥♥♥ about the pirate, so I'll tell you about the pirate. You go to the Carribean to try and make money to support you and your wife back in England. After you kill an assassin, you decide to impersonate him and go to a meeting in Havana, where it turns out that the Templars plan to find a place called the Observatory. Edward, seeing a way to make money, decides to try to go after it. He is then imprisoned, but breaks free and takes a ship and a crew that are willing to go after the observatory with him as long as they get paid. You are thrown unwillingly between the duel for power between the Assassins and the Templars as well, which is interesting to see how this plays out. The story is interesting, I was engrossed enough, there were a couple neat twists throughout the whole story. The ending was sweet, I'm glad I made it to the end. Oh yeah, and that DNA playing thing was good I guess. Overall great.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Same ♥♥♥♥ as the last couple ♥♥♥ Creed games. You run around, have a lot of gadgets, you can do parkour. Stealth gameplay is fine, but I feel like sometimes it is kind of unfair, though it might just be because I suck. Combat is great, feels fairly satisfying. The parkour stuff is fine. Ship combat is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing as well, I love fighting on ships. Just remember, play with a gamepad. Keyboard controls are kind of bad.\n\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE: Game looks damn good. Water looks very nice, environments are nice, kind of the same jungle-y areas for the most part, but still nice. This game takes a lot for it to run, however, so you might want to hold off on this unless you have a PC that can handle it. My rig could barely run it even. But if you have a good PC, it won't matter.\n\nCHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: Edward Kenway is a good character. It's kind of interesting seeing him evolve from a man who only does something for a paycheck to a loyal member of the Assassin's (spoiler? meh, probably not.) You come across some notable members of pirate history, including Blackbeard, Black Bart, and some more guys who I probably could recognize if I paid attention better in social studies the day we went over these names. If this was a review of AC3 I could tell you every single ♥♥♥♥ing name in that game, I bet. xD You don't really have any notable members of your crew with the exception of Adewale, a slave who helps you escape your prison and take over your ship and becomes your First Mate. He's awesome as well. Not really any bad voice acting I'd say, character design is decent, so I can't really complain.\n\nSIDE ACTIVITIES: Land activities are simple. You can go on assassin missions where you have to take a guy out, you can help other Assassin's out in order to find keys to a safe, you can raid storehouses, you can use your eagle vision to find Mayan keystones, you can syncronize points to reveal bits of the map, or you can just go around and look for collectibles. Seawise you can attack and conquer forts, which reveal parts of the map, you can go harpooning sea animals for crafting purposes, you can go on naval contracts that are essentially assassin missions but on a boat, and you can, of course, attack and plunder ships like a true pirate. You can also go underwater with assistance of a diving bell and explore underwater wrecks. Decent amount of variety with these, I think I might miss one or two but you get the idea. Nice amount of stuff to do.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Nice place to start off in the ♥♥♥ Creed saga. Any game that doesn't have Desmond Miles in it only gets points to me. 9/10, definately worth picking up sometime soon.\n\nIn a world without gold, we would be heroes Kenway!","October 21, 2015","true","35.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

This is a pretty damn fun iteration of an AC game. Best game I can compare it to right now is Mad Max. The combat is pretty meh, the story/development is decent, but the best part is roaming the open world collecting things and destroying everything in your path. Basically mad max (the game) on the ocean.\n\nI can't name any other game where i've gotten to control my own ship in an open world setting, at least none that were memorable. This game lets you have your own ship with a lot of weapons/upgrades/customization, and you can take it just about anywhere and do anything.

Matter of fact, I think it would be a terrible game if it focused more on the Assassin aspect of the story, that didn't really seem to fit the main character or the situation he found himself in all that well.\n\nBut while Ubisoft may have given us a mediocre AC game with Black Flag it seems they accidentally created an amazing and beautiful pirate game.\nThe Pirate story is believable, the setting and maps are absolutely breathtaking, as is the experience out on sea, with the sound of waves crashing against your ship, cannons and seagulls in the distance and your crew singing shanties as you roam the map in search of adventure.\n\nIf this game is on sale and you can run it I see little reason to not pick it up, it's easy to lose yourself in the beautiful world and story and I can't think of a single pirate oriented game that can even reach the overall feel of this title.\n\n\nTL;DR: Meh AC game, Amazing Pirate game.

Just read my criticisms and decide for yourself.\n\nI only played the first and second AC. The first was a clumsy mess of a game but very innovative. I remember thinking to myself "Can't wait to see what they do next, with all issues solved. This is going to be the go-to formula for AAA games in the next few years". I guess I was right, AC 2 did solve all its issues and expanded on the original. And this did became the go-to formula for AAA games even to this day.\n\nThen, after many years without playing an AC game, but playing plenty of sprouts of AC, like Batman, Just cause and many others, I gave AC another try with Black Flag. Heard great things about it, so why not. I don't remember exactly how AC 2 felt when playing, so my main parameter for comparison comes from Batman games, and I don't know if Batman really improved on the formula or if this AC took a few steps backwards.\n\nAbout free running/climbing. The level/missions' design certainly doesn't respect the limitations of the system. The game makes you chase enemies through narrow streets, so you will find yourself climbing a wall that was exactly perpendicular to the direction you were running because you brushed against it. Then the game makes you stalk people, but you can't rely on this movement scheme will do what you think it should. When you are two levels above the guards and want to drop to the second level you might end up doing a somersault with a rolling finale on the guards' feet instead.\n\nThe parkour system is actually impressive, with glitches here and there, like getting stuck at small steps and not finding the occasional edge, but it's the level design that simply doesn't know what it can do well. On the sea there is a similar issue. It's all very fun, sailing through storms, attacking other ships, upgrading etc. Until the game decides to throw an escort mission. Oh god. An escort mission. On a ship. What else? underwater level? slippery ice level? (retro references :P) And this is yet another example of mission design that doesn't seem to respect the mechanics a whole lot. Sure, you can finish this level, but not with skill. You will play again and again until you know where the ships are coming, just like you did for the chase and stalk missions. It's not the kind of level design that makes me happy. It feels like a chore.\n\nDoes all of this break the game? not at all. It does make it frustrating about half the time. In fact, it feels like AC1 all over again! I remember feeling exactly like this, admiring the potential and wanting to see what comes next in the series. Only now I'm not that curious anymore, specially after I heard this is the best of the series since AC2.","January 5","true","22.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evan/recommended/242050/","evan","HugeJerk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evan/","198 products in account","Assassin's Creed 4 is so very close to being the Pirate game I've always wanted. The variation of things to do kept the game moving along, pacing isn't an issue when the game gives me the freedom to choose. Often times I'd spend a few hours sailing the seas, harpooning, stopping to pick up some lost treasure, or liberating ships from their captains to add to my own fleet... all between doing the story missions.\n\nEnvironments have been given plenty of detail and character of their own. Havana, Nassau, Kingston, and the island ports all have a unique ambience. The ocean, where you will likely spend a good amount of time, also keeps things interesting with changing weather and wave conditions. The water even has a correct appearance when you see the light shining through the wave.\n\nCombat can still have some odd stumbles, but the majority of the time it felt smooth. Weapon variation seems to have taken a backseat in this incarnation. Dual swords, pistols, hidden daggers, and fists are what you'll use the most, with rope darts making a very late entry. I didn't use the heavy weapons much in the previous games, but I had hoped to see some one handed fencing to round out the swashbuckling experience.\n\nThe Good: Player character has personality, something AC3 lacked. Large open world is fun to explore. Controls feel improved.\n\nThe Bad: Storyline feels disjointed at a few steps along the way. The ending wasn't very satisfying. Lack of weapon variation.","November 26, 2013","true","169.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PadgerMan/recommended/242050/","PadgerMan","PadgerMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PadgerMan/","605 products in account","This is my first review and I am trying to portray everything I think so feel free to leave feedback for me or questions in the comments!\n\nAssassin's Creed IV may have reached the pinnacle game out of my Assassin's Creed collection.\n\nFirst the bad:\n\nTechnical Issues: A pain in the a** to preload and some bugs, but Ubisoft has been pretty good about patching them out so it shouldn't apply to anybody. The worst glitch I had by far, a kill objective that wouldn't go away and led to nothing, has been patched out, and aside from that most of the bugs I encountered in the game were actually quite funny, like my ship disappearing and leaving a hole in the sea, and rising out of the hole like it was some kind of dimensional ship later. One of my friends did report a lot of crashing for him when he first installede the game, but that has been fixed. One REALLY BAD issue is that two of my Assassin's Creed-playing friends have had their save files reset by the game and had to start all over again, so keep your eye out for that. I can see why they waited three weeks to release it, as it would've been much more of a mess if they hadn't. Also on a side note, I had an SSD that made loading screens nonexistent, but when I had to move it over to my 7200 RPM hard drive to make room for BF4, and the load times were much much longer, and it took away from the awesomeness of fast traveling.\n\nKenway's Fleet: There is a feature you unlock relatively early int he story that is similar to the Assassin Brotherhood from Brotherhood/Revelations/AC3 where you can send your ships on trading missions for easy cash. The only catch is that you have to unlock the ships from in-game (which I love) and that you have to use resources you get from fighting in ship battles inside the Kenway's fleet minigame, which is terrible. You pick ships that go against their ships, make sure the Odds of success is high, and press the space bar. You have to watch the ships slowly duke it out, and the only thing you can do during then is maybe if you feel like it use a limited fire barrel that does a very small amount of damage on the enemy ship. I know this is supossed to be for the mobile app, but it is still VERY tedious and they still have to port it over to phone. It is an easy way to get cash and I am very very happy Ubisoft didn't make this a giant microtransaciton-fest, but I only do it if I have to. Friends can help your ships out on missions by speeding them up or healing them, but overall it kinda sucks.\n\nNo pets: Come on...\n\nHome island: Not too long into the game you get access to an island you can build up similar to the Homestead from AC3. However, unlike AC3, there are no missions, you just throw large amounts of money at people so they can build things for you. For example, you can build a great fire thing that will let the Drunken Pirate group you can recruit be free. It's better than nothing, but I actually liked the Homestead missions.\n\nCombat (kind of): It hasn't changed much from AC3, it is still extremely fun to kill people and I have pride in my 5,000+ kills in the game. The only thing I miss from previous games is that in this you only have three main weapons you always have with you: two swords you hold at the same time, your fists, and hidden blades. Anything else you can only pick up for a small amount of time.\n\nWhat is good/great:\n\nStory: I loved the story. The pirate one, while not as good as AC2/Brotherhood (and I never expect any AC game to measure up that high) it was really good. In the near future world, you play a mute first-person Abstergo employee who does things with memory and stuff because I don't want to spoil AC3 for you. While I wish the story connected a little more to the end of AC3 (aside from the ending), I know that this lets Ubisoft make as many games as they want until Assassin' Creed dies and they can make a final game. The piratey story focuses more on pirates than anything else. Edward just picks up an Assassin suit in the beginning and says "I like this". He doesn't become a true Assassin until the very end. However, they set a end goal with the Assassin storyline and let you go about your piratey buisnesss, mostly pertaining to Nasau, the pirate HQ of sorts.\n\nTutorial/Controls: It is not very long, and aside from the diving bell, you get almost everyhting not very far into the game. They have definitely learned from the last game in that regard. I just switched to PC this game, I used to play them on Xbox, and the keyboard/mouse controls felt natural and all the buttons mapped out (Xbox 360 controllers are suportted but mine broke and I wanted to get used to the keyboard controls). They have a system where if the game notices you keep failing at something (like block) it will remind you how to do it. It is very cool, and if you don't like it you can turn it off (I tihnk)\n\nMultiplayer: While still not as good as single player, the multiplayer is very fun. I was able to quickly start a clan with my friends and we went on Wolf Pack which was very fun. While most of my AC friends haven't even touched multiplayer, it is a very oversighted feature that should be played for a bit at least.\n\nGraphics: I got my GTX 770 a day before my AC4 game came out, so I was able to see the glorious visuals that completely eclipse anything the Xbone and PS4 have to offer. I could max it out at 30-50 FPS (driver updates will make it run better) and if I turned down non-essential features like anti-aliasing and kept shadows and texture quality high, it looks gorgeous at 40-60 FPS. My friend has an older computer, but he says it looks decent if you don't mind turning a couple settings down. Keep in mind NVIDIA cards have bonuses like God Rays and some antialiasing and other stuff that is cool but not essential.\n\nCombat: Still very fun, very addictive, and has more challenge than the one-button Ezio days. It always makes me happy to see a room filled with dead Spaniards or British.\n\nShip Stuff: An incredible addition to the game. It isn't a sailing sim by any means, but it is fun to sail your ship around, stopping at Caribbean islands to get some booty or to find some Assassin Contracts. Ship combat is much more compex than AC3, with many weapons at your disposal. It looks pretty too, and the best part is that if you want all the loot the ship has to offer you bring its health down then board it, going along the rope swings, manning the swivel guns, or jumping from your mast to theirs. It becomes normal Assassin's Creed again, with the objective of killing people and doing other things like blowing up gunpowder or cutting down flags/ When you take over a ship, you can either destroy it to repair your ship, lower your notoriety (it only applies to ships now) or send it to Kenway's Fleet, which I covered earlier. Either way, you get resources, crew members, and sometimes money. Resources can either be sold (like rum or sugar) or used for upgrades (like cloth, wood, and metal). More crew members means more people firing your cannons and helping you fight the people you're boarding (even though they are really bad at it) You can also "save pirates" in some of the land segments, where you kill their captors and they will join your crew. Also, if you're desperate, you can buy crew members or lower notoriety from people near tavens. Speaking of notoriety, if you destroy too many ships they will send bounty hunters after you. You can just attack them like any other ship, it's just that they have red sails and will look for you. I didn't find ship battles to be TOO hard because I was great at resource management and it didn't take too long to get all the best upgrades.\n\nOVERALL: Buy it. It is amazing. Friend me on Steam or Uplay (wkhammond)\n\nTime to beat story: I did many of the side quests and such before, and it took 30-35 hours to beat.\nAdvice or tips: Uplay is required to play it as anotehr form of DRM. I didn't mind it, but some may MOR BELO","December 16, 2013","true","103.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

AC4 strips away the what was clunky about the previous title.  By pullling the camera back again giving a wider range with the big open environments we can finally fully appreciate what a next gen Assassin's Creed game can bring.\n\nThe world is huge giving more than enough to exlpore after completion and ofter has you wondering far off the main storyline to persue your own interest.  As a pirate you can truly go anywhere or go at whatever you want.  Side tasks and optional missions are no longer a grind and instead have you going on just to persue them.\n\nAnother cool thing is the AC4 Black Flag Companion App which syncs with your game.  While playing you can use your Andriod device for World Map and Treasure Maps.  You're also able to run your naval fleet remotely for shipping runs or look through the animus database.","March 4, 2014","true","62.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The worst glitch I had by far, a kill objective that wouldn't go away and led to nothing, has been patched out, and aside from that most of the bugs I encountered in the game were actually quite funny, like my ship disappearing and leaving a hole in the sea, and rising out of the hole like it was some kind of dimensional ship later. One of my friends did report a lot of crashing for him when he first installede the game, but that has been fixed. One REALLY BAD issue is that two of my Assassin's Creed-playing friends have had their save files reset by the game and had to start all over again, so keep your eye out for that. I can see why they waited three weeks to release it, as it would've been much more of a mess if they hadn't. Also on a side note, I had an SSD that made loading screens nonexistent, but when I had to move it over to my 7200 RPM hard drive to make room for BF4, and the load times were much much longer, and it took away from the awesomeness of fast traveling.\n\nKenway's Fleet: There is a feature you unlock relatively early int he story that is similar to the Assassin Brotherhood from Brotherhood/Revelations/AC3 where you can send your ships on trading missions for easy cash. The only catch is that you have to unlock the ships from in-game (which I love) and that you have to use resources you get from fighting in ship battles inside the Kenway's fleet minigame, which is terrible. You pick ships that go against their ships, make sure the Odds of success is high, and press the space bar. You have to watch the ships slowly duke it out, and the only thing you can do during then is maybe if you feel like it use a limited fire barrel that does a very small amount of damage on the enemy ship. I know this is supossed to be for the mobile app, but it is still VERY tedious and they still have to port it over to phone. It is an easy way to get cash and I am very very happy Ubisoft didn't make this a giant microtransaciton-fest, but I only do it if I have to. Friends can help your ships out on missions by speeding them up or healing them, but overall it kinda sucks.\n\nNo pets: Come on...\n\nHome island: Not too long into the game you get access to an island you can build up similar to the Homestead from AC3. However, unlike AC3, there are no missions, you just throw large amounts of money at people so they can build things for you. For example, you can build a great fire thing that will let the Drunken Pirate group you can recruit be free. It's better than nothing, but I actually liked the Homestead missions.\n\nCombat (kind of): It hasn't changed much from AC3, it is still extremely fun to kill people and I have pride in my 5,000+ kills in the game. The only thing I miss from previous games is that in this you only have three main weapons you always have with you: two swords you hold at the same time, your fists, and hidden blades. Anything else you can only pick up for a small amount of time.\n\nWhat is good/great:\n\nStory: I loved the story. The pirate one, while not as good as AC2/Brotherhood (and I never expect any AC game to measure up that high) it was really good. In the near future world, you play a mute first-person Abstergo employee who does things with memory and stuff because I don't want to spoil AC3 for you. While I wish the story connected a little more to the end of AC3 (aside from the ending), I know that this lets Ubisoft make as many games as they want until Assassin' Creed dies and they can make a final game. The piratey story focuses more on pirates than anything else. Edward just picks up an Assassin suit in the beginning and says "I like this". He doesn't become a true Assassin until the very end. However, they set a end goal with the Assassin storyline and let you go about your piratey buisnesss, mostly pertaining to Nasau, the pirate HQ of sorts.\n\nTutorial/Controls: It is not very long, and aside from the diving bell, you get almost everyhting not very far into the game. They have definitely learned from the last game in that regard. I just switched to PC this game, I used to play them on Xbox, and the keyboard/mouse controls felt natural and all the buttons mapped out (Xbox 360 controllers are suportted but mine broke and I wanted to get used to the keyboard controls). They have a system where if the game notices you keep failing at something (like block) it will remind you how to do it. It is very cool, and if you don't like it you can turn it off (I tihnk)\n\nMultiplayer: While still not as good as single player, the multiplayer is very fun. I was able to quickly start a clan with my friends and we went on Wolf Pack which was very fun. While most of my AC friends haven't even touched multiplayer, it is a very oversighted feature that should be played for a bit at least.\n\nGraphics: I got my GTX 770 a day before my AC4 game came out, so I was able to see the glorious visuals that completely eclipse anything the Xbone and PS4 have to offer. I could max it out at 30-50 FPS (driver updates will make it run better) and if I turned down non-essential features like anti-aliasing and kept shadows and texture quality high, it looks gorgeous at 40-60 FPS. My friend has an older computer, but he says it looks decent if you don't mind turning a couple settings down. Keep in mind NVIDIA cards have bonuses like God Rays and some antialiasing and other stuff that is cool but not essential.\n\nCombat: Still very fun, very addictive, and has more challenge than the one-button Ezio days. It always makes me happy to see a room filled with dead Spaniards or British.\n\nShip Stuff: An incredible addition to the game. It isn't a sailing sim by any means, but it is fun to sail your ship around, stopping at Caribbean islands to get some booty or to find some Assassin Contracts. Ship combat is much more compex than AC3, with many weapons at your disposal. It looks pretty too, and the best part is that if you want all the loot the ship has to offer you bring its health down then board it, going along the rope swings, manning the swivel guns, or jumping from your mast to theirs. It becomes normal Assassin's Creed again, with the objective of killing people and doing other things like blowing up gunpowder or cutting down flags/ When you take over a ship, you can either destroy it to repair your ship, lower your notoriety (it only applies to ships now) or send it to Kenway's Fleet, which I covered earlier. Either way, you get resources, crew members, and sometimes money. Resources can either be sold (like rum or sugar) or used for upgrades (like cloth, wood, and metal). More crew members means more people firing your cannons and helping you fight the people you're boarding (even though they are really bad at it) You can also "save pirates" in some of the land segments, where you kill their captors and they will join your crew. Also, if you're desperate, you can buy crew members or lower notoriety from people near tavens. Speaking of notoriety, if you destroy too many ships they will send bounty hunters after you. You can just attack them like any other ship, it's just that they have red sails and will look for you. I didn't find ship battles to be TOO hard because I was great at resource management and it didn't take too long to get all the best upgrades.\n\nOVERALL: Buy it. It is amazing. Friend me on Steam or Uplay (wkhammond)\n\nTime to beat story: I did many of the side quests and such before, and it took 30-35 hours to beat.\nAdvice or tips: Uplay is required to play it as anotehr form of DRM. I didn't mind it, but some may MOR BELO","December 16, 2013","true","103.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The story and characters are far and away the most well-done out of any of the previous ACs, and the open world aspects are substantial and engaging. While pirating itself is done well, fleet commanding leaves a lot to be desired, and the present-day sections (in true AC fashion) can feel like a distraction from the main game. Though there is not a huge incentive to explore many of the smaller islands outside of 100% completition, other side quests and city exploration make up for it.\n\nMy biggest critique is that apart from optional objectives and quests where detection results in failure, stealth is rarely the best option. The combat--while fluid and enjoyable--is easy enough that Edward will have pretty much no problem with any group size as long as you are attentive. That said, the combat is very visceral and well-animated, and enjoyable despite it's lack of challenge.\n\nOverall, an excellent title and easily one of the best Assassin's Creed games to date. The non-Desmond based story makes it ideal for new players entering the series as well.","December 1, 2013","true","59.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There's still a lot of annoying elements, such as the outdated combat system and clearly-not-fit-for-purpose control scheme, but the majority of the game is actually a whole lot of fun.\n\nThe much-touted naval system is an improvement on AC3's, but I feel like they're putting too much emphasis on it. It's almost like they'd rather distract you than fix the obvious problems with the core gameplay mechanics. Nevertheless, it's a feature and a mighty impressive one at that.\n\nIf you weren't a fan of the real-life side of the AC storyline, then you'll be disappointed that it's back, though it seemed a bit less pretentious than in previous outings. It's always been one of those love it or hate it scenarios, but I felt they did a better job this time.\n\nIt's not a difficult game, either, which can be good or bad depending on your preference, but the lack of difficulty actually seemed to make it more fun to play, as you could set up awesome air assassinations much more easily. The stealth sections are much more forgiving than in previous titles, but still can be frustrating if you're going for undetected objectives.\n\nOutside of those issues above, the game is a gem and legitimately fun to play. Kenway has swag much like Ezio did in AC2, which filters down through the story and into the game itself, as every action he takes is saturated in swashbuckling cool. A highly enjoyable game with minor issues that don't really detract too much from the game experience.","January 16, 2014","true","42.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'll keep my review short as I don't believe words can replicate or convey my feelings and opinions about this game adequately.\n\nGameplay: Without a doubt the strongest AND weakest of the franchise thus far. The variety in naval, land and underwater allows the player to never feel as if they're repeating the same thing over and over, which was a major downfall of Assassin's Creed 3 and the weakest entry of the series thus far. Ubisoft could very well have taken out Templars and Assassin's, renamed the game Pirates, and it would stood on it's own as a solid IP from Ubisoft. With that being said, having Black Flag considered an entry in the AC franchise harms a few things. Swordplay is still pitiful in terms of complexity and effort with the same mindless mashing of X to slaughter endless hordes of Templars being intact once again. Collecting is a tad bit more tedious now but this is something to expect from a game that is next-gen along with being on sea as well as land\n\nControls: Black Flag is going to be marked as the buggiest and most frustrating AC game so far. Ubisoft has yet to figure out how to polish the climbing of this game back to how effective it was in AC2. Automating the climbing makes navigating ships more difficult than it was in AC3 (which was already a buggy mess on it's own) and the increased number of actual ledges, ropes and trees to climb only amplifies how painful it is to navigate on land and sea effectively. But if we turn our eyes towards ship and sea controls, this is a gigantic step forward from AC3. The expanded arsenal that Edward has available at his disposal along with the seamless selection of weapons makes naval combat a matter of quick thinking and timing rather than jumping through a thousand control hoops. I never had to think about which weapon I was using, only to gage where my ship was relative to the target and I instantly knew what I had to use and how to use it. Ubisoft also expanded ship controls beyond combat, adding in a Travel Speed that allows a more relaxing, cinematic perspective while sailing the high seas alone. On top of this, designating one button to Dock, Release and Board makes it simple to understand what you want to do at any time.\n\nStory: While Black Flag will never hold a candle to how tighly wound Ezio's initial storyline was in AC2 or the simplicity that we had in AC1, Edward's tale is cleaner, more entertaining and enjoyable than any moment Conner's story ever had to offer. Before you ever take on the robes of the Assassin's, you can feel Haytham's energy pouring out of Edward but with more purpose and context. Playing Edward makes it easy to see why we enjoyed Haytham so much and why Conner was such a disappointment in comparison. The continuation of Desmond's story is hard to care about as Black Flag has a massive disconnect with Desmond for much of the story and leaves us wanting more. I do hope Ubisoft returns to the idea of a modern day AC entry as Desmond's sequences in AC3 felt more difficult and stressful as you are without the Animus UI to guide you. You, like Desmond, had to adapt to the enviroment and think on your feet instead of being given indicators and waypoints.\n\nOverall: If you were worried about Black Flag after how disasterous AC3 was, like myself, do not fret: Black Flag is easily the best entry since Assassin's Creed 2 and serves to allow Ubisoft to go in different directions with a new IP using the naval gameplay of Black Flag along with pushing us closer to more modern day entries in the franchise. Edward is what we've always wanted from an AC protagonist: Full of character, rich with dialogue and meaning, and complexity that allows you to believe that what Edward is doing is what HE wants to do instead of being shoved into his role like Conner and Ezio.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nControls: 7/10\nStory: 7.5/10\nOverall: 8.25","December 27, 2013","true","36.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I bought this game at a later date to get it at a lower price and in the hopes that all the bugs and wrinkles would be ironed out.\n\nI don't need to complete that paragraph, do I?\n\nI bought the game mainly for the multiplayer, and haven't played the single-player beyond the first island, so this review won't be going into that. I am sure it also has its share of annoyances. In any case, I was hoping that Ubisoft would have learned from all the ♥♥♥♥ups of the past, but no.\n\nThere are three kinds of bugs: the first kind is the one you can live with. The other kind is one that prevents you from playing, something that is often a mercy.\n\nThe third kind is the kind that is tantalizing, something you think you could ignore... but no. It is there, ♥♥♥♥ing up your day, all the time in the most frustrating ways possible.\n\nI don't get angry at games. Except... Assassin's Creed Multiplayer.\n\nThe MP is a mess of connection and server-side issues. For example, for me the leveling mechanism does not work properly, and I will be rewarded with in-game skill point currency I am due if I am very lucky during a particular session. Then there are the constant matchmaking and connection issues that plague the game itself. We live in the far-flung future of 2014, and Ubisoft still hasn't figured out how to program a multiplayer game that doesn't ♥♥♥♥ with you at random.\n\nI tried to reset my password at the Ubisoft support site, but even their password reset system is bugged, because they ♥♥♥♥ed up their recaptcha system by providing two obligatory fields when the captchas themselves are just providing single-word Googlemaps address numbers nowadays.\n\nThis is a good time to mention the time I discovered that when registering into Ubisoft-something-or-other the system would glady accept a password with space characters--and then not accept passwords with spaces in them when logging in, making you question your sanity as you desperately try to figure out why all your passwords don't work.\n\nThis mess of frustration is just a culmination of Ubisoft's philosophy of tossing out a new game every year and trying to monetize the ♥♥♥♥ out of it in the meanwhile, all the while ignoring the glaring problems their games have as they migrate on to their next project: their grandest, most vast ♥♥♥♥ up to date, whenever that is.\n\nI am reasonably certain that the Abstergo Credit bug is because you can now buy microtransaction currency for real money. The systems for preventing abuse are also ♥♥♥♥ing everything up for everyone else. Some people have even reported not getting their microtransaction rewards, which is the only reason why I don't think Ubisoft is preventing normal in-game currency collection to sell Erudito credits.\n\nAs the multiplayer component of an AC game dies out as each new titles in the series come out, I wish that the multiplayer could be divorced from the single player in order to give it the time it needs to mature and to keep a steady long-time player base. As it is, though the MP is a beautiful, beautiful game, it is beautiful in the way that a sick person dying of consumption in some old Gothic novel is beautiful: pale, doomed and breaking my heart.","June 22, 2014","false","9.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The only AC games that kept my interest long enough to actually finish were AC1, AC2, AC: Brotherhood and this AC. The story is amazing and meeting infamous, half-drunk pirates like Blackbeard, Horningold, Kidd, Rackam and etc never gets old. Their personalties make the cutscenes worth watching and the dialouge interesting.\n\nFor me, the most important aspect of a game is story and characters. In AC3, Connor was very unlovable and I was always apatheic towards his situation. As for Edward Kenway, he is the epitome of a pirate character. He is charming, charismatic and extremely lovable even when he's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You relate to him, feel sorry for him and desperately want him to outlive all his fast-going pirate comrades. The end of this game is also heartwarming and is extremely satisfying, leaving the player wanting more Kenway.\n\nIn a world run by anarchy, debauchery and betrayal, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is the epitome of a pirate experience.","February 13, 2014","true","68.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/barefootmatthew/recommended/242050/","barefootmatthew","barefootmatthew","http://steamcommunity.com/id/barefootmatthew/","213 products in account","Hands down, the BEST pirate simulation game on the market. This is the game that Disney WISHES they could make with the "Pirates of the Caribbean" license, as it accurately models all of the appropriate kinds of things that one could ever wish for from a game about pirates. Sailing the seven seas looking for treasure? Check. Intense naval battles and skirmishes that you just manage to survive by the skin of your teeth? Check. Carousing and brawling in taverns and dives throughout the West Indies? Check, check, and check. As a pirate game, Black Flag is just about perfect. As an Assassin's Creed game, well, let's just say that Ubisoft could have completely left that whole assasins versus templars subplot out of the game and none of us would have missed it. In all honesty, the AC franchise has floundered somewhat in recent chapters of the series, so if the pirating part of Black Flag weren't so strong to make up for the lackluster plot contrivances of the greater mythology, I would have come away disappointed. But as it stands, I've got alomst 100 hours in on this game, and reached 90% completion, butI could easily see myself adding to that total just trying to track down all the hidden treasures, upgrading the Jackdaw, running resources all over the world with my fleet, and plundering anything and everything that sails the open ocean. This game is amazingly beautiful as well.\n\nNot everything about it works as well as it could. The same control issues that have plagued the series from the beginning remain - Edward too often springs off in the wrong direction, or grabs a ledge when you want him to air-assassinate someone, and don't even get me started on the cluster-frak that is deck-fighting. And although there was some effort put towards improving stealth play, it's still falling well behind games where that is the main mechanic. I still found myself much too often just saying "forget it" and wading in with dual swords drawn. At the very least, the number of "remain undetected" missions is kept to an absolute bare minimum, allowing me to enjoy the campaign without screaming obscenities at the screen (so far the only real obsceneites have been directed towards the optional Legendary ships, who cheat like the floating cheaters that they are).\n\nI certainly recommend this game for fans of the series, but also for those who were never a fan of the series. Unlike previous entries, Edward Kenway is NOT an assassin, nor does he really work for them. He's out for himself and his friends, and it just so happens that their interests align at times. Because of this, you don't need to know the backstory to understand Edward's motivations or what he's doing from moment to moment. If you're a fan of pirates at all, it's well worth the price to pick up this robust game.","November 28, 2013","true","95.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

The story is top notch. in this AC title you review the memories of Edward Kenway a man who became a pirate to try and become rich to support his family. well on one unfortunate day the ship he was on wrecks and he is stuck whith what you think is an assassin on a beach so you end up cassing said assassin down killing him and taking his outfit and a object to be dilivered to the govoner of Havana. Well turns out that they are templars the assassin that you killed betrayed the assassin's and guess what the templars are searching for an object that will give them the power to take over the world. So you gotta kill them and get the object easy enough. Ok well the story might sound a bit dull but trust me its good. Character development is outstanding and there were quite a few twists  and scenes that left me saying "♥♥♥♥ you game" in a good way of corse. also you play as an employee for Abstergo to make movies so the templars can find a peice of eden.\nGameplay is pretty much the same just with a few diffences wich mostly pertain to naval combat so all of that is good.\nAnd finaly the look of the game. The graphics are outsanding. Nice texture quality, reletivly good lighting, and the enviornments were really well done. Also if your pc can handel maxing out water do it cuase it looks really nice.\nAlright so what are the flaws of this game.\nLets start with naval combat. Now dont take this the wrong way, The naval combat is well done but my god if i dont want to do naval combat to grind ship upgrades for the love of god dont put 2 man o wars infront fo a missinon zone as well as a naval fort please. That is probobly the biggest flaw this game has. Like i said naval combat is well done but some people are not fans of naval combat.\nAnd then another flaw i have is with the Audio. It seems like there is a bug with rain and your audio settings where once it starts raining Kenway turns into MR. Elephant man and start stomping arround causing all sorts of ear ♥♥♥♥. it got tot the point in some parts where i could not stand to have my headset on my neck because of how loud the game got.\nSo  how do i rate this game i give it about a 8 out of 10 and definatly worth your time if you like the AC franchise\n","May 31, 2014","true","30.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While not on an island or in one of the three major cities, you're on your ship. This ship, called The Jackdaw, can be upgraded with a dozen of very diverse and funny upgrades which really add to the fun.\n\nFurthermore, they've added additional completetion stuff eg. the "Templar Armor". This can be unlocked by completing a serious of "Templar Hunt"-missions which almost act as different story-lines.\n\nThe epic sea-fights are, yeah, epic... You never get tired of them, especially if you happen to run into a storm while fighting. In this scenario you'll have to steer your ship through tornados and rouge-waves while the thunder rages above you and at the same time keeping an eye out for the enemy ship whose cargo were the only thing you wanted. It dosn't get anymore intense than this.\n\nWhen adding that much new content to a game that already has a flawless gameplay, you're sure to make something great. It is obvious that this game is the result of long and tough working process, but it really payed off.\n\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is the best game in this series ever released.","May 19, 2014","true","46.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And AC II is in my top 10 games of the past 20 years.\n\nFirst off, the gameplay. This game definitely take a bit of a change from the AC titles of old that put emphasis (ish) on stealth. You're a pirate with two swords. And four pistols. And a lot of other tools in your arsenal. If there's no stealth bonus for the particular mission you're playing, or the game doesn't require you to stay hidden, it's actually to your advantage to go in guns blazing and swords flashing. You'll get the job done quicker and if you're even moderately okay at countering enemy attacks, it's possible to get through the entire game without taking a single point of damage to Edward. Pretty cool. The kill animations are also pretty satisfying, so bonus for that too.\nThe climbing animations are fantastic as well. Scaling tall buildings in mere seconds has never felt so good. That 5 story church tower over there? You can climb it in probably 6 seconds. Edward climbs fast, and his agility is definitely a focal point of his animations.\n\nThe story. I haven't finished it yet, but I think I'm probably 80ish percent done. The story is probably the second best part of this game. As is AC's trademark, there are famous people integrated quite well, and you can actually develop feelings towards these different characters, including Edward. Without saying much, it is a long story in comparison to the previous AC titles because of.....\n\nThe sailing. The naval mechanics of this game are EXTREMELY well done. This alone could have sold this game. The camera angles look good and aren't crazy, and changing the angle is as simple as can be. The ship you sail on, the Jackdaw, comes with plenty of weapons too, and changing which weapon you fire is as simple as changing the camera angle. The story takes so long because it's absolutely essential you upgrade your ship to progress. Edward upgrades come last (unless it's crafting. Those don't cost reales), Jackdaw upgrades are hugely important.\n\nBasically, 9.5/10","May 20, 2014","true","49.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They probably downloaded so much porn that their computer is melting.\n\n\nI am not kidding when I say Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is the best Assassin's Creed ever made. First of, old, annoying mechanics of the previous games have been fixed, like the stupid wanted-poster hunting after killing a single guard.\n\nBack then if you did something wrong every guard in the city instantly knew about it and everyone in the world was hunting you. Now if you do a crime and kill every guard who saw it, you are perfectly fine. It now actually makes fun to roam around the cities and hunt for treasure-chest (or kill some random guards if you're feeling down). Also we finally have a simple fast-travelsystem: One map with all the locations and cities to zoom in and out, and not Map of City A, Map of wasteland inbetween, Map of City B and continent-map.\n\nAs the title of the games says, it is focused around pirate-history and ships. With your ship, the Jackdaw that you obtain soon in the game, you can explore the whole world very early and if you want you can freely start battles with nearby ships (note that its not a good idea to attack 3 giant warships if you're not ready for it). If you attack and board enemy ships and manage to take them over, you can gain various cargogoods from them, wich you need to upgrade your Jackdaw with better cannons and armor. Notice again how free you are to move, if we drive near to a little island with a treasure on it, we can actually stop the ship anywhere we want in real time and personally swim to the island. Its fun and a pleasure to fight with your Jackdaw and upgrade it until you can take out the giants of the sea. (And upgrading it can take a lot of time, the upgrades require high amounts of money and cargo-goods, and unlike in the previous games the money is not thrown at you this much).\n\nSadly, most of the missions on land (about 50-60% of the main missions have something to do with the sea and sailing your ship) are not very creative, the usual eves-dropping to conversations, killing people, doing contracts, and so on.\n\nThe story focues on Edward Kenway, who has to leave his girlfriend in england and become a pirate to make gallons of money. Thats what Edwards motive is, instead of something like honor or freedom from the other characters its the incredible greed that makes him strong, not a noble but reliable and quite realistic motive. One day Edwards ships sinks and he finds himself on an island with an assassin. He kills the assassin and takes his armor (because he can). The assassin carried a letter and the player can put the pieces together and find out that that assassin was a baddy and wanted to join the templars. Bad for Edward that he does not know that, so he just lives the roll of the assassin now and goes deeper and deeper to the conflict of assassins and templars without even realising it. Througout the story we meet other famous pirates like Blackbeard or James Kidd. Sadly the story has, like most of the other games, plotholes or poorly written scenes every now and then. (5 Enemy Soldies enter the village that Edward wants to protect and its instantly taken over with no fight what so ever and how does Edward even know on the map where the next event for the main story takes place even if no one told him where to meet or what will happen). Especially at the middle-end of the story it gets extremely sloopy and feels a bit lazy done.\n\nThe gameplay yet is entertaining and there are tons of side activities you can do like plundering warehouses for cargo, attacking special ships and convois, taking over enemy fords, hunt for whales and sharks in a quite realistic minigame, use treasure maps to get da booti money, and another very good innovation: you can dive for treasures in special under water levels where you have to avoid sharks and stuff. Then there is your fleet, your trading map from where you can send out ships to get money from buissness and even more!\n\nOver all: Buy this game if you are an assassin's creed fan and still like innovation, you can get insane amounts of fun from it.","December 1, 2013","true","71.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

YES you should buy this game! (I totally sound like a fanboy in the review and I apologise, it's just that this game gave me the same feeling AC II managed to deliver and I am excited about that)\n\nWARNING: IF you decide to buy this game after reading this, GET IT ON STEAM! you don't want to get it on uplay, Uplay isn't ready for us. (you do require uplay to play but i experienced 0 issues with that)\n\nThis game is awesome!\nthere it is! i said it, Yes it is your yearly release so you know what to expect i guess, but also you don't.\nThis is a pirate game, now I have to start by saying that I am not a huge fan of pirates, they are cool and the pirates of the caribean movies were awesome but i'm not really a sea person. I had to make an exception for this game.\n\nBack to a nice funny/awesome main character:\nIt may be a little strange that edward can do all the things assassins do considering he is not an assassins when you begin. I always liked connor, i liked his story and enjoyed playing it but I had a hard time stumbeling through ACIII and i didn't do any side missions at all. This feels like AC II: where we got to learn an amazing new character who sticks with me till this day, damn i love ezio. (no homo)\nI think i have already played this game more than Assassins Creed III but i am not even half way done with the story, i am really doing every side objective I can get my hands on. And the Phone application makes it a little easier which i love. If you have an ipad or smartphone you can download the companion app and do some cool stuff on there.\n\nMechanics:\nAll the mechanics are basically the same, a lot of the animations are shared between AC III and AC IV. I have to admit i am not bothered by it. The combat still looks awesome and feels awesome. The game is EASY! yes full caps, i went there. but yeah if you are looking for a challenge i suppose that you should not play this game, I like easy to be honest, it makes me feel good about myself xD.\nThe naval combat/exploration/just sailing around is amazing! In my opinion they nailed the pirate feeling. in my opinion it can get a little to busy on the open seas and that can poop on your immersion i guess. if you want to sail the seas with nobody in sight, well... that's not going to happen there are always other ships around you. (A lot of the times they leave you alone though, if you are a nice guy).\nIf you don't like the naval system that's fine as well it's required for some missions of course but you can still use fast travel and there are a lot of epic things to do on land. (such as exploring some beautifull sceneries)\n\nWait?! you get to play in the present as well?!?!?! not that S#$( AGAIN!\nYes! you do get to play present day again and i've heard some complaints about it but if i have to be honest with you, I like it.. a lot even. It is kept to a true minimum and if you don't give a rats ♥♥♥ about the present guy well, then you can ignore him and stay in the aninuminuminus . (there are some required leaves introducing you to things you can do during the modern time) I am not going to spoil things but since the moment i've entered that building i noticed things, certain voices/faces/ and other things that you will recognize if you played the previous games. It is really really a nice change of pace for me and does not feel forced or wrong. I was expecting only madness from the current time in AC IV but i got something really cool!\n\nMultiplayer:\nI am not going to lie, I don't buy AC for the MP. I really liked what i played for the few hours that I played it, it's fun, there is a solid tutorial for the new people (me) and there is some co-op mode but don't expect to much, it's not really special at all. It's cool and you can get a few extra hours of game time from there, maybe you will like it and stay.\n\nMusic:\nI am a very big music person, game music interests me beyong anything you can imagine. And assassin's creed has some of the best if not the best music in the industry. The soundtrack for IV is very solid and especially the Main menu music does it for me again! in-game you have a lot of songs that your crew can sing, I like it but that's not really my thing, when i talk about music i mean the score. So far it has been solid at the level of AC but nothing to fancy yet. (besides the Main menu music of course! epic!) I won't rate the music just yet.\n\nBugs/Support/performance:\nBugs: This game has way less bugs than accassins creed, it's like they played it a little more safe, for which i am happy because DAMN! AC III had some major game breaking bugs when it released and then we are not even talking about people just teleporting in and out of your screen right before your eyes! Don't get me wrong, this game has bugs and mistakes but come on, that happens with such a huge open world and in my opinion none of these are game breaking.\nSupport: My experience with Ubisoft support is terrible! 0/10, AC III had a bug where the audio would go missing, 1000's of people had this and it took them a month to reply, i hope this has been improved but I can't say anything about it yet.\nPerformance: I play this game on almost the highest settings (way higher then NVidia experience recommends) and it runs at a solid 30FPS, it is capped at 30.. yeah 0.0 <- that was my first reply as well.. what is this !?!?, if the game doesn't perform to well it will cap your FPS at 30, this is an nvidia thing though. But i like it, it makes the gameplay feel smooth and the graphics look very nice, it is well optimized in my opinion and there are a lot of settings you can change. (playing at a solid 30 is a better experience than playing with 60 FPS that has drops to 30, this is way more noticable then a steady FPS) It does not look as good as in the screenshots though. I don't know why games keep marketing their product falsely, it just gets your expectations up to high and it can only disappoint. (YES WATCHDOGS I AM TALKING TO YOU! YOU BETTER LOOK AS AWESOME AS THAT E3 DEMO!)\n\nThe game is a full price game and it re-uses a lot of things learned in old games, but in my opinion the story + side objectives (of which there are soo many!) make this game worth it's price. If you like assassin's creed I am pretty sure you will love this game. I would like to recommend you get the Digital deluxe edition, this also gives you a 25% discount on the season pass + a lot of other cool things.\n\nI am sorry for the many spelling mistakes in this review, I made it very quickly after playing the game and I need to get some sleep!\n","December 2, 2013","true","41.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They probably downloaded so much porn that their computer is melting.\n\n\nI am not kidding when I say Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is the best Assassin's Creed ever made. First of, old, annoying mechanics of the previous games have been fixed, like the stupid wanted-poster hunting after killing a single guard.\n\nBack then if you did something wrong every guard in the city instantly knew about it and everyone in the world was hunting you. Now if you do a crime and kill every guard who saw it, you are perfectly fine. It now actually makes fun to roam around the cities and hunt for treasure-chest (or kill some random guards if you're feeling down). Also we finally have a simple fast-travelsystem: One map with all the locations and cities to zoom in and out, and not Map of City A, Map of wasteland inbetween, Map of City B and continent-map.\n\nAs the title of the games says, it is focused around pirate-history and ships. With your ship, the Jackdaw that you obtain soon in the game, you can explore the whole world very early and if you want you can freely start battles with nearby ships (note that its not a good idea to attack 3 giant warships if you're not ready for it). If you attack and board enemy ships and manage to take them over, you can gain various cargogoods from them, wich you need to upgrade your Jackdaw with better cannons and armor. Notice again how free you are to move, if we drive near to a little island with a treasure on it, we can actually stop the ship anywhere we want in real time and personally swim to the island. Its fun and a pleasure to fight with your Jackdaw and upgrade it until you can take out the giants of the sea. (And upgrading it can take a lot of time, the upgrades require high amounts of money and cargo-goods, and unlike in the previous games the money is not thrown at you this much).\n\nSadly, most of the missions on land (about 50-60% of the main missions have something to do with the sea and sailing your ship) are not very creative, the usual eves-dropping to conversations, killing people, doing contracts, and so on.\n\nThe story focues on Edward Kenway, who has to leave his girlfriend in england and become a pirate to make gallons of money. Thats what Edwards motive is, instead of something like honor or freedom from the other characters its the incredible greed that makes him strong, not a noble but reliable and quite realistic motive. One day Edwards ships sinks and he finds himself on an island with an assassin. He kills the assassin and takes his armor (because he can). The assassin carried a letter and the player can put the pieces together and find out that that assassin was a baddy and wanted to join the templars. Bad for Edward that he does not know that, so he just lives the roll of the assassin now and goes deeper and deeper to the conflict of assassins and templars without even realising it. Througout the story we meet other famous pirates like Blackbeard or James Kidd. Sadly the story has, like most of the other games, plotholes or poorly written scenes every now and then. (5 Enemy Soldies enter the village that Edward wants to protect and its instantly taken over with no fight what so ever and how does Edward even know on the map where the next event for the main story takes place even if no one told him where to meet or what will happen). Especially at the middle-end of the story it gets extremely sloopy and feels a bit lazy done.\n\nThe gameplay yet is entertaining and there are tons of side activities you can do like plundering warehouses for cargo, attacking special ships and convois, taking over enemy fords, hunt for whales and sharks in a quite realistic minigame, use treasure maps to get da booti money, and another very good innovation: you can dive for treasures in special under water levels where you have to avoid sharks and stuff. Then there is your fleet, your trading map from where you can send out ships to get money from buissness and even more!\n\nOver all: Buy this game if you are an assassin's creed fan and still like innovation, you can get insane amounts of fun from it.","December 1, 2013","true","71.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean Abstergo employee.\n\nThe Assassin part is similar to the previous games, but it is improved.\n- Sword fighting feels alot better than previous games, its more Batman-like (Arkham games) and less Counter-kill spam.\n- Range weapons are powerful, but not over powered.\n- They finally put stealth mechanics in the game!!!! A game about Assassins!!!! (You can hide in bushes, long grass and are able to move around)\n- Mission design is really good, and more varied than previous games.\n- Side missions are amazing too, they range from under-sea diving to whaling to taking over forts.\n\nBeing a ship captain is the best part of the game.\n- I enjoyed exploring the high seas more than the storyline, I kept exploring till the point where all that I could was the main storyline.\n- Your Ship is upgradable and the system is extensive.\n- Ship combat is great. It consists of shooting cannons at each other and then boarding for some sword fighting to capture the ship. Its really addicting.\n\nBeing a ubisoft employee is in first person, and you mainly do hacking puzzels in it.\n- Doing these puzzels unlocks background information, that is really interesting.\n\nMultiplayer\n- haven't touched it, but maybe intersted\n\nOther Stuff\n- Optimization could be better, but it`s a beatiful game.\n- UPLAY :((   (it`s uncomfartable programm for me. idk about you.

Is that a good thing? YES it is.\nWhy? Because a lot of ppl out there are a little tired of the AC game play etc. It gets boring after some time. Sneakin , listening , kill , run , rinse repeat.  I was one of those people. But think of this "Black Flag" addition as Sand box, exploration, pirate game and the finnaly, at the end, AC gameplay in the mix.\n\nI actually bought this game because I was looking for a good pirate game. Let me tell you, it does not come better than this. I love sailing the open waters with my crew singing shanty's across the deck. Looking out over the insanely beautifull enviroment, that you sail past. Next moment I'm in a sea battle with 2 ships. 1 of them has the "metal" I need to upgrade my cannons. So I shoot them to pulp and then start boarding the ship. Then this turns into a fight with swords and guns on the enemy boat. I take the loot, sink their ship, sail to a harbor and sell the sugar and rum. Got enough money now for the upgrade on my ship.\n\nThen I decide that I want a little bit more money, so I go visit the place where they keep the pigeons with assain contracts on them. Yes this is where the AC part begins, but the village is so beatifull and scenic, that i forget about the rinse repeat stuff and just kill the target, split and the go buy some harpoons because a White Whale has been spotted infront of the coast, I can hunt.\n\nThe map is huge, where most of your travel consists of Sailing your ship across the water.\n\nThe game is awesome. To put it down in numbers would not be right. Main caracter is really well done. Charcters you meet are rich of story and looks. The voice overs are to good to be true. Landscape Is amazing. I especially like the sea. Music is ok, shanty's are brilliant in my op. Gameplay as always is pretty solid.\n\n1 thing I did not like! You need to have BEAST of gaming rigg to full experiance ultra settings. Got a I5 3570k clocked to 4.1 ghz, got a crossfire hd 7970 royal king, graphic card setup. It uses it all to 98% So thats max. I play it in ´high` settings.\n\nIf you are a AC fan or a former one. Buy it, beacause they are back!\n\n\n\n","October 27, 2014","true","61.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

TXAA does its job correctly as well. I've rarely seen a game that looks this nice unmodded, though it obviously doesn't stack up to the likes of, say, Crysis 3.\n\nWhile the freerunning is a bit sloppy as in past titles, it's easily manageable, and the handful of forced stealth missions in the game are compensated for by a fair share of naval combat missions.\n\nMost of the time I've spent on the game has been sailing, capturing ships, sieging forts, whaling, hunting and collecting the various collectibles strewn around the Caribbean, and it's these things that I've enjoyed the most about the game. I would say the games' strongest points are its appearance and theming, and most of the aforementioned activities build into the latter, setting a distinctly swashbuckling mood.\n\nAgainst the game are a cheesy plot and a reliance on quick time events for encounters with predatory wildlife, particularly sharks which are moderately difficult to avoid and cannot be dealt with in any other way. These aren't big concerns for me. The game also has a definite point where there isn't much left to do, the story is completed, everything there is to be collected is had and you've seen every bit of the world and conquered every enemy, but that isn't a complaint so much as what's there, which has been over 175 hours' worth in my case, being good enough that I want more.","July 8, 2014","true","281.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No longer are you hunting templars from the get go. No, this story pulls you in gradually, making you care more for its characters than its overarching plotlines. And that's not a bad thing. In fact, its the characters that will leave the most lasting impression on you in this game. Well, that, and blowing the heck out of the British navy, but meh... that's just fun for a few times, right?\n\nWrong. The gameplay in this game is, dare I say, wild, ambitious, intense, adventorous, and risky. Yes, risky. There was never a gaurantee that ship based naval combat would work in a series like Assassins Creed, but Ubisoft flexed their muscles on this one. Not only does it work, its plain fun. Sailing the seas and riding the waves is peaceful, but its the cataclysmic storms that blow in your way whilst you're engaged with a Spanish frigate that really spices things up. Things like using waves as cover, and trying to time your shots just right so you maximize damage and unload with your swivel guns. It's damn intense. And no, it doesn't get old fast. After the 30th ship, its still fun. Damn fun (again).\n\nPumping that action and exploring along is a score that, again, might be the best in the series. Nothing has made me feel more like a pirate up to no good since Zimmer's classic campaigning themes from the Pirates of the Carribean films. I'll just say... music is suppose to enhance the experience; this score does that. Therefore it succeeds.\n\nI don't want to go into nitty gritty details about the story, but I will say there is no 'one story'. It starts off making you think its that simple, but as it goes on, things crumble, loved ones die, priorities shift, and Edward changes. It's a great progression, and one I'd enjoy seeing more from this series. Edward is extremely likeable. Even when plundering and scavenging. Even when being the badass pirate he is, there's a lot to like about this man who's simply looking for an easy life. Albeit, one that cannot be obtained easily. And that quest for riches and a quiet peaceful living soon take a turn when he's caught up in much larger affairs.\n\nThere are a few errors for all its glory, though indeed they are few. Some graphical glitches here and there, including the occasional pop in textures. The modern day story line succeeds in really doing nothing but pulling you away from the story you *actually* care about. There's also some AI bugs that could use some attention. The graphics in general, while beautiful on the seas, begin to show their age on land. That, likely, being the outcome of it being a cross gen title and not running on a pure 'next gen' optimized engine; something we'll have to wait for Unity to bring.\n\nAll in all, this is a great one. The best in the series, I would say. Definitely the best since the second, which seems to be most people's favorite. But for me the bombastic score, adventurous theme, intense naval battles, and superior character writing to anything Ubisoft has put out so far in the franchise, puts this entry a wave above the rest.\n\nAssassins Creed IV: Black Flag sails in high at a score of 8.9","July 23, 2014","true","57.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After the 30th ship, its still fun. Damn fun (again).\n\nPumping that action and exploring along is a score that, again, might be the best in the series. Nothing has made me feel more like a pirate up to no good since Zimmer's classic campaigning themes from the Pirates of the Carribean films. I'll just say... music is suppose to enhance the experience; this score does that. Therefore it succeeds.\n\nI don't want to go into nitty gritty details about the story, but I will say there is no 'one story'. It starts off making you think its that simple, but as it goes on, things crumble, loved ones die, priorities shift, and Edward changes. It's a great progression, and one I'd enjoy seeing more from this series. Edward is extremely likeable. Even when plundering and scavenging. Even when being the badass pirate he is, there's a lot to like about this man who's simply looking for an easy life. Albeit, one that cannot be obtained easily. And that quest for riches and a quiet peaceful living soon take a turn when he's caught up in much larger affairs.\n\nThere are a few errors for all its glory, though indeed they are few. Some graphical glitches here and there, including the occasional pop in textures. The modern day story line succeeds in really doing nothing but pulling you away from the story you *actually* care about. There's also some AI bugs that could use some attention. The graphics in general, while beautiful on the seas, begin to show their age on land. That, likely, being the outcome of it being a cross gen title and not running on a pure 'next gen' optimized engine; something we'll have to wait for Unity to bring.\n\nAll in all, this is a great one. The best in the series, I would say. Definitely the best since the second, which seems to be most people's favorite. But for me the bombastic score, adventurous theme, intense naval battles, and superior character writing to anything Ubisoft has put out so far in the franchise, puts this entry a wave above the rest.\n\nAssassins Creed IV: Black Flag sails in high at a score of 8.9","July 23, 2014","true","57.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although it makes me sad that the pirate mechanics will probaly won't ever be used again, the game is stellar. Graphics are beautiful, the various gameplay modes are exceptionally fun, and there is a LOT of content to get through. Even the social minigames- Kenway's Fleet, is a fun little diversion. Certain side missions did feel tedious and unrewarding at times- hunting, whaling, and diving.\n\nNow I'm hoping that I liked this game enough as an Assassin's Creed title enough to like future games in the series.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamersomething/recommended/242050/","gamersomething","Supersomething","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamersomething/","193 products in account","Lets start with the Pros:\n-Fully fleshed out ship warfare.  If you enjoyed the ship battles in AC:III Then you need to get this game.  Seriously... it's great\n\n-Huge explorable map.  Relatively soon after the introduction after you get your ship, the world is your oyster.  The further south you go the harder the ships get, so be careful.\n\n-COLLECTIONS, COLLECTIONS, COLLECTIONS.  You have Animus fragments, messages in a bottle, treasure maps that you must collect and then lead you to treasure, sea shanties for your crew that they actually sing, and various wildlife for you to exterminate to make yourself look cooler, oh and the Mayans left some stuff laying around.\n\n-The atmosphere is absolutely amazing.  The shanties mentioned before are actually sung really well and makes your pirate ship come alive.  Cities feel lifelike and there is plenty to do on the high seas.\n\n-Oh yah... this is Assassins Creed.  There are two different types of Assassin style missions.  Pirating assassinations, and the Creed assassinations.  So get out there and kill some people.\n\n-If you have a tablet PC you can further enhance your experience by downloading the app that aids you while you're within the game.  This app will load up the full map and you can mark things on the map on your tablet and it will mark it in your game.  It will also track your overall progress, load up your treasure maps instantly if you're on an island that relates to that map, and manage your fleet of ships even if you're off line.  This is one of the first games I have played where  the mobile app for the game actually provides great functionality.  If you do not have a tablet you can load it on your mobile phone as well.\n\n-Legendary ships provide a great challenge for the mastery of your vessel in combat.\n\n-Without giving too much away the story and its characters are all absolutely fantastic and is on par with AC:II story telling.\n\nSo the Cons\n-Get stuck on random stuff sometimes when free running\n\n-Weird issue when loading in and seeing your ship in either; A. Massive pit in the ocean.  B. Popping up from the bottom of the ocean.  C. Doing a reverse titanic and unsinking itself.   Its pretty rare that it does this, but its still pretty funny.\n\n-Boat variety is a bit lacking.  There is only five classes of ships you will ever see in the game, plus the unique legendary ships.  The Man O' War's can put up a good fight though, especially if they have help.\n\n-Similar to Watch_Dogs the PC optimization is quite awful so heres a pro tip:\n1. Turn off in game Vsync, and set the Physx Particles to Low.\n2. Turn on Adaptive Vsync through your Nvidia control panel and voila... enjoy your many pirating adventures.\n\nOverall the game is quite wonderful and I would rank it up there with ACII in terms of game play.","June 22, 2014","true","67.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I was not disappointed in the slightest, and in fact, I liked all of the gameplay enough that I bought the rest of the games in the series when they went on sale.\n\nFantastic sailing and ship combat, and the parkour and melee combat are both well done and lend themselves well to both land and sea-based encounters.  The story was pretty well done, and I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of many of the famous pirates of the time.  The present-day stuff was a little strange and jarring, but with a little research into the previous games, it wasn't too bad. Still, I feel the game would have been better without it. It's really the only complaint I had about the game, and it's a minor one at that.\n\nOverall, a fantastic game that I would highly recommend.","September 5, 2014","true","228.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They did it beautifully, one of the top enjoyable mechanichs of all the time for me.\n\nThe story still didnt quite captivated me like the first instalments but i can say for sure that it returned my faith in the series since this time i actually cared about the main character and enjoyed some of his life lessons and how things turned out.\n\nThe DLCs story wise are extremely short but the Freedom Cry was the best giving an good arc to an overlooked character, the costume ones as expected give a little flavor but thats it.\n\nThe Multiplayer ends up beeing the same thing as previous games but something extra to try and keep it fresh but i feel kinda saturated with it.\n\nSo in the end this was an game resparked my interest in the series so if you are having doubts about the series aswell i suggest you give it a chance.","September 7, 2014","true","117.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Luckily, I was wrong. Ubisoft delivered an amazing game, not just by it’s story, but all of it. I always thought that any other game could be better than the second one, but they made it. It’s not just entertaining, it has amazing scenarios and many, many places to explore. Another thing that impressed me was the weather system. I risk saying that it’s the best I’ve ever seen in a game. The only complain I have is about the PC version. It’s graphically amazing, but not well optimized. Nothing compared to ACIII, of course.

YES you should buy this game! (I totally sound like a fanboy in the review and I apologise, it's just that this game gave me the same feeling AC II managed to deliver and I am excited about that)\n\nWARNING: IF you decide to buy this game after reading this, GET IT ON STEAM! you don't want to get it on uplay, Uplay isn't ready for us. (you do require uplay to play but i experienced 0 issues with that)\n\nThis game is awesome!\nthere it is! i said it, Yes it is your yearly release so you know what to expect i guess, but also you don't.\nThis is a pirate game, now I have to start by saying that I am not a huge fan of pirates, they are cool and the pirates of the caribean movies were awesome but i'm not really a sea person. I had to make an exception for this game.\n\nBack to a nice funny/awesome main character:\nIt may be a little strange that edward can do all the things assassins do considering he is not an assassins when you begin. I always liked connor, i liked his story and enjoyed playing it but I had a hard time stumbeling through ACIII and i didn't do any side missions at all. This feels like AC II: where we got to learn an amazing new character who sticks with me till this day, damn i love ezio. (no homo)\nI think i have already played this game more than Assassins Creed III but i am not even half way done with the story, i am really doing every side objective I can get my hands on. And the Phone application makes it a little easier which i love. If you have an ipad or smartphone you can download the companion app and do some cool stuff on there.\n\nMechanics:\nAll the mechanics are basically the same, a lot of the animations are shared between AC III and AC IV. I have to admit i am not bothered by it. The combat still looks awesome and feels awesome. The game is EASY! yes full caps, i went there. but yeah if you are looking for a challenge i suppose that you should not play this game, I like easy to be honest, it makes me feel good about myself xD.\nThe naval combat/exploration/just sailing around is amazing! In my opinion they nailed the pirate feeling. in my opinion it can get a little to busy on the open seas and that can poop on your immersion i guess. if you want to sail the seas with nobody in sight, well... that's not going to happen there are always other ships around you. (A lot of the times they leave you alone though, if you are a nice guy).\nIf you don't like the naval system that's fine as well it's required for some missions of course but you can still use fast travel and there are a lot of epic things to do on land. (such as exploring some beautifull sceneries)\n\nWait?! you get to play in the present as well?!?!?! not that S#$( AGAIN!\nYes! you do get to play present day again and i've heard some complaints about it but if i have to be honest with you, I like it.. a lot even. It is kept to a true minimum and if you don't give a rats ♥♥♥ about the present guy well, then you can ignore him and stay in the aninuminuminus . (there are some required leaves introducing you to things you can do during the modern time) I am not going to spoil things but since the moment i've entered that building i noticed things, certain voices/faces/ and other things that you will recognize if you played the previous games. It is really really a nice change of pace for me and does not feel forced or wrong. I was expecting only madness from the current time in AC IV but i got something really cool!\n\nMultiplayer:\nI am not going to lie, I don't buy AC for the MP. I really liked what i played for the few hours that I played it, it's fun, there is a solid tutorial for the new people (me) and there is some co-op mode but don't expect to much, it's not really special at all. It's cool and you can get a few extra hours of game time from there, maybe you will like it and stay.\n\nMusic:\nI am a very big music person, game music interests me beyong anything you can imagine. And assassin's creed has some of the best if not the best music in the industry. The soundtrack for IV is very solid and especially the Main menu music does it for me again! in-game you have a lot of songs that your crew can sing, I like it but that's not really my thing, when i talk about music i mean the score. So far it has been solid at the level of AC but nothing to fancy yet. (besides the Main menu music of course! epic!) I won't rate the music just yet.\n\nBugs/Support/performance:\nBugs: This game has way less bugs than accassins creed, it's like they played it a little more safe, for which i am happy because DAMN! AC III had some major game breaking bugs when it released and then we are not even talking about people just teleporting in and out of your screen right before your eyes! Don't get me wrong, this game has bugs and mistakes but come on, that happens with such a huge open world and in my opinion none of these are game breaking.\nSupport: My experience with Ubisoft support is terrible! 0/10, AC III had a bug where the audio would go missing, 1000's of people had this and it took them a month to reply, i hope this has been improved but I can't say anything about it yet.\nPerformance: I play this game on almost the highest settings (way higher then NVidia experience recommends) and it runs at a solid 30FPS, it is capped at 30.. yeah 0.0 <- that was my first reply as well.. what is this !?!?, if the game doesn't perform to well it will cap your FPS at 30, this is an nvidia thing though. But i like it, it makes the gameplay feel smooth and the graphics look very nice, it is well optimized in my opinion and there are a lot of settings you can change. (playing at a solid 30 is a better experience than playing with 60 FPS that has drops to 30, this is way more noticable then a steady FPS) It does not look as good as in the screenshots though. I don't know why games keep marketing their product falsely, it just gets your expectations up to high and it can only disappoint. (YES WATCHDOGS I AM TALKING TO YOU! YOU BETTER LOOK AS AWESOME AS THAT E3 DEMO!)\n\nThe game is a full price game and it re-uses a lot of things learned in old games, but in my opinion the story + side objectives (of which there are soo many!) make this game worth it's price. If you like assassin's creed I am pretty sure you will love this game. I would like to recommend you get the Digital deluxe edition, this also gives you a 25% discount on the season pass + a lot of other cool things.\n\nI am sorry for the many spelling mistakes in this review, I made it very quickly after playing the game and I need to get some sleep!\n","December 2, 2013","true","41.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well I guess another gripe would be when running and trying to save time you will often try to run up a wall that you cannot even if you are running away from the wall. But all in all this is the best assassin's creed game so far in my opinion, I like how they explained what happened from assassin's creed 3 without going to far in depth just enough for you to understand where this one falls in the timeline and how it is even possible for the game to continue. The soun effects in the game are very realistic the waves the birds the cannons even the sound of the wind in the sails is dead on, if you like naval combat from the game Pirates of the burning sea this is the game for you. I have yet to test out the multiplayer but if it is anything like the multiplayer from assassin's creed 3 it should be good though the maps did get a bit repeatative however if you are playing this game for the multiplayer you are missing out on a wonderful story line.","June 24, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I was not disappointed in the slightest, and in fact, I liked all of the gameplay enough that I bought the rest of the games in the series when they went on sale.\n\nFantastic sailing and ship combat, and the parkour and melee combat are both well done and lend themselves well to both land and sea-based encounters.  The story was pretty well done, and I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of many of the famous pirates of the time.  The present-day stuff was a little strange and jarring, but with a little research into the previous games, it wasn't too bad. Still, I feel the game would have been better without it. It's really the only complaint I had about the game, and it's a minor one at that.\n\nOverall, a fantastic game that I would highly recommend.","September 5, 2014","true","228.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Leaving the stealth elements to a bare minimum and focusing on naval combat and exploration of the caribbean makes this a worthwhile standalone game if not very assassin's creed-y one. The present time storyline manages to be little more than an anchor hindering your progress through the game and its passable actual story and characters. To quote Deadpool: "He's not here ten seconds before he starts boring us with his dire warning-from-the-future crap!" Seriously Ubisoft, just drop it and pretend it never existed and everyone will be happy. Other than the story, combat is entertaining enough for the duration of an average playthrough but is a bit on the easy side again, an issue that seems to haunt AC games for all eternity. It looks very cool and the finishers feel satisfyingly brutal, but it really needs some challenge to it. Best point of the game is definetly the naval combat, which feels pretty epic and took the majority of my playtime. Boarding the ships is okay, what with the occasional, no wait, constant crew members hacking you in the back and generally being in the way of cleaning the deck effectively. But despite its many flaws I had fun with this title, more so than previous AC's. Maybe not worth the launch price which I paid but good game overall.","November 17, 2014","true","36.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The real eye-candy are the islands that are literally everywhere on the world map. Even the small, miniscule islands are absolutely gorgeous and are worth exploring. The water, the weather, the day/night cycles, everything graphical in this is just amazing to look at.\n\nAnd the main character is finally likable in an AC game again. Connor in AC3 was just annoying to me, so Ezio was the last really likable character in the series. Edward is a bit of an anti-hero, but that's what makes him likable. Not only is the acting done really well, but he has no issues with doing what he pleases for whatever he wants...as you would expect a pirate to be like.\n\nSo yes, great title and very worth the buy","November 23, 2014","true","49.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With this out of the way i can now explain why this is a difinate recommendation, again the graphics are amazing the huge open world looks beautiully expansive stretching right through the Caribbean and is unlike anything i have seen in games yet, the graphics on the waves are uniquely lifelike, as for the combat the fighting looks almost corriagraphed with flowing combos. i again now go to the possibilities of the open world, i found myself lost in all the side quests as they were so fun and adverturous, by taking fortresses, exploring islands and hunting for treasure, overall this is a fantastic game and i would recomend it anyone","November 28, 2014","true","134.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Comparing to AC III, the combat was a lot more fun and enjoyable, the characters were a lot more likeable, and the protagonist didn't insist on being a ♥♥♥♥ throught the entire story. When I played AC3, after not too long I got bored with the game - then I started to burn through the story to feel better about putting the game down. With AC4, though, I spent lots of time having fun exploring, finding collectibles, doing side-missions, building up my ship, and of course, being a pirate. The Ship-Ship combat is, in my opinion, stellar. Not too difficult to get the hang of, but it stays fun, from the first few ships to the 100th and beyond. Looking back, I think there was a 15 consecutive hour period of gameplay in which I by-passed the main story entirely, focusing on the side missions and taking over ships.\nComparing to the earlier AC games, especially AC3, the controls were MUCH better in this game. I remember half of the rage I had in AC3 was due to unexpetedly jumping to my death innumerable times just to get to a viewpoint or something. There were a few instances of this in AC4, but they were far fewer and more manageable than I've previously experienced.\nI experienced a few bugs during the game, but only once was there an interruption - luckily I only had to re-play five minutes worth to get back to where I was, but it's still bothersome.\nWith the - to me- somewhat lackluster enjoyability of AC Revelations and the rather boring and annoying AC3, I wasn't fully sure about spending the money on AC4. Now that I've played it, I'm glad I did, and this game has restored my hope that this series still has some life and fun left in it.","July 2, 2014","true","43.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A new Assassins Creed only a year after the last one... Bet this is going to be like Call of Duty. I was pretty happy with Assassins Creed (AC) 3 singleplayer. The story was desent, and the maps were pretty good - but like with all other AC games, I never got into collecting or multiplayer.\nI desided to go around AC4, 'cause how can it be any good so close to the last one?\n\nI had my birthday just after New years, and desided to try out AC4, due to good reviews.\n\nAnd boy was i pleasently suprised! First of all, they cut back on all that Animus crap from the other games, so that was a great suprise.\nThe story is "okay", nothing like AC1 or AC2, but good enough to keep you moving forward.\nYou play a pirate that engages in navelcombat with a random boat, that has an Assassin onboard. You both end up on the beach, and after abit of learning the movements and combat, you end up killing him and taking his clothes. Turns out he was a traitor, and you use this for personal glory. I wont spoil it all here :)\n\nThe big thing in the game is the sailing. And do it deliver big time. I love roaming the sea, having my crew sing different songs, and plundering innocent merchant ships from Spain or Great Britain. The naval combat functions really well, and it is easy to switch between weapons, controling the ship and boarding other vessels.\nIts so much fun, that after reaching Act 8 (of 13) i totaly forgot about the story and just went around plundering and upgrading my ship.\nAfter a while I desided to get back to the story, and finished it rather quickly. But the game wouldnt let me go there.\n\nAfter finishing, I really wanted to collect stuff. You can see on your map, when a location has been depleted of all activity (it turns yellow). And it didnt take long for me to make them all turn yellow!\nThe most tedious part was the diving missions, because you have very limited movement and time (and no weapons). But ive heard from others they found them to be the most thrilling parts of the game...\n\nIve now fully upgraded my ship, got a badass Mayan (bulletproof) Armor and almost collected everything in the game. Ive spent 60+ hours, and was very entertained all the way.\n\nAnd on a end note, may I recommend watching the Black Sails (starz) serie that is currently running in between gameingsessions, just to keep the mood going! :D\n\nTL:DR; Desent singleplayer, great navalcombat and really adictive!

Is that a good thing? YES it is.\nWhy? Because a lot of ppl out there are a little tired of the AC game play etc. It gets boring after some time. Sneakin , listening , kill , run , rinse repeat.  I was one of those people. But think of this "Black Flag" addition as Sand box, exploration, pirate game and the finnaly, at the end, AC gameplay in the mix.\n\nI actually bought this game because I was looking for a good pirate game. Let me tell you, it does not come better than this. I love sailing the open waters with my crew singing shanty's across the deck. Looking out over the insanely beautifull enviroment, that you sail past. Next moment I'm in a sea battle with 2 ships. 1 of them has the "metal" I need to upgrade my cannons. So I shoot them to pulp and then start boarding the ship. Then this turns into a fight with swords and guns on the enemy boat. I take the loot, sink their ship, sail to a harbor and sell the sugar and rum. Got enough money now for the upgrade on my ship.\n\nThen I decide that I want a little bit more money, so I go visit the place where they keep the pigeons with assain contracts on them. Yes this is where the AC part begins, but the village is so beatifull and scenic, that i forget about the rinse repeat stuff and just kill the target, split and the go buy some harpoons because a White Whale has been spotted infront of the coast, I can hunt.\n\nThe map is huge, where most of your travel consists of Sailing your ship across the water.\n\nThe game is awesome. To put it down in numbers would not be right. Main caracter is really well done. Charcters you meet are rich of story and looks. The voice overs are to good to be true. Landscape Is amazing. I especially like the sea. Music is ok, shanty's are brilliant in my op. Gameplay as always is pretty solid.\n\n1 thing I did not like!

TXAA does its job correctly as well. I've rarely seen a game that looks this nice unmodded, though it obviously doesn't stack up to the likes of, say, Crysis 3.\n\nWhile the freerunning is a bit sloppy as in past titles, it's easily manageable, and the handful of forced stealth missions in the game are compensated for by a fair share of naval combat missions.\n\nMost of the time I've spent on the game has been sailing, capturing ships, sieging forts, whaling, hunting and collecting the various collectibles strewn around the Caribbean, and it's these things that I've enjoyed the most about the game. I would say the games' strongest points are its appearance and theming, and most of the aforementioned activities build into the latter, setting a distinctly swashbuckling mood.\n\nAgainst the game are a cheesy plot and a reliance on quick time events for encounters with predatory wildlife, particularly sharks which are moderately difficult to avoid and cannot be dealt with in any other way. These aren't big concerns for me. The game also has a definite point where there isn't much left to do, the story is completed, everything there is to be collected is had and you've seen every bit of the world and conquered every enemy, but that isn't a complaint so much as what's there, which has been over 175 hours' worth in my case, being good enough that I want more.","July 8, 2014","true","281.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the beginning however, we had a bit of a rough patch with some players such as losing Saved games, and hours of play time spent. With constant updates, it shows Ubisoft still cares about it's PC gamer community (Optimization being another topic) for the most part. Now, optimization isn't much of an issue to me, as my Rig is pretty powerful, but for others whom don't have this, it's a real pain, as you have to play on the lowest of low sometimes, just to get a decent frame rate. Even with some of these cons though, it's a really quite beautiful game. It brings the best of both worlds, Pirates and Assassins, with the occasional Templar. Now not to spoil anything from AC3, but in this one you may be confused as you play you, in the beginning and not Desmond. This to me is a really great aspect of the game, as you get to be yourself. Now, don't take this as you get to customize how your real life character looks because you can't, I just find it different, and kind of nice for a change. Just like Ezio, even though he was great, it was time to move on after 3-4 titles with him in it. Overall however, this game is a great buy. If you have a decent gaming PC, make sure to give this a go. Final Score would be: 8.7/10","January 20, 2014","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The grind for upgrades/the need for DLC to give you stuff that should be basic/and the remaining Assassin's Creed game elements are dubious at best. The main character is much more likeable than AC3, but the villains are decidedly less interesting.

I'll keep this simple, Pros and Cons:\n\nPros\n\n-Sailing. Between the ambient sounds, the crew singing, and random events, it's exciting, and even soothing.\n\n-Naval combat. Much refined from AC3, simpler even with added features. And much more exciting.\n\n-Pirating. I was glad to see the pirating had a purpose, after all, you have to have some way to obtain the wood, metal, and money needed for those shiny new broadside cannons you want.\n\n-Open world. Huge world, many places to discover and explore. Which brings me to the next pro.\n\n-Fast travel. With a world that big you need a good fast travel system for those who use it. Not only does each place have a fast travel option, but every synchronization point is its own fast travel.\n\n-Graphics. The game is beautiful. While things like hair looking a little flat, and rain popping indoors aren't very impressive, the rest of the world definitely is.\n\n-Voice acting. Top notch.\n\n-Music. Some of the sea shanties, and tavern songs still get stuck in my head from time to time. And I even YouTube a few, just to hear them again.\n\n-Present day missions. The Desmond missions left much to be desired. But I found these missions very interesting, and fun. I would actually look forward to the next mission.\n\n-Story. Some don't agree, but I liked it. It was a change of pace. The main character wasn't hell bent on revenge, he was a pirate after the next big payday. The story got more and more intriguing as time went on.\n\n-Crafting/Upgrades. Always fun to upgrade your character/gear. Especially seeing the changes affect the look of the Jackdaw.\n\n-Kenway's Fleet. Fun and rewarding mini game.\n\nThe next pros, are also cons. And each point will be explained in the appropriate section.\n\n-Game play. Had some very fun missions, utilizing each of the game's strengths.\n\n-Combat. The fighting was fluid, and simple. A little to simple for some, but still fun nonetheless.\n\n-Weapons. You have your usual swords, hidden blades, and guns. But they added the blow gun, which with it's sleep, and berserk darts came in handy all throughout the game.\n\nCons\n\n-Game play. Way too many tail and eavesdrop missions for my taste. Yes it's a stealth-ish game. But some just seemed to not be properly implemented, and just down right frustrating.\n\n-Combat. Seemed watered down from AC3. Which in my opinion was some of the coolest finishers I've seen. And you get like a fourth of them in AC4. And the slow mo finishes didn't have sound, which took away from the epic-ness for me.\n\n-Weapons. Again, watered down from AC3. There's no slot for a heavy weapon. And even though there are different types of each weapon, the guns are the only one you actually can notice a difference in. Also you don't get the rope dart till towards the end of the game.\n\n-Shipwrecks. Can be frustrating, the main downfall for me was not having a defense for the ridiculous amount of sharks congregating in the area.\nThis next con was the biggest for me, and it might not be the games fault, it could just be mine.\n\n-The glamor just kind of wore off. I reached a point where money was no longer an issue, and my character, and ship were fully upgraded. So that just left the story. And with annoying tail and eavesdrop missions after another I eventually got turned off and stopped playing for a while. I actually felt obligated to finish it because I paid $60 for it and wanted to see how it ended.\n\nAgain, that could just be me. Y'all might not run into that problem. But one thing I have noticed, is starting after Brotherhood, my in game hours have been dwindling for every new installment of the AC series. It could be the way the games are being made now, or again it could just be me.\n\nEverybody has their own opinion, and I'm just giving you mine. And my opinion on this game, is that it is definitely worth a buy. And a must have during a big sale.\n\nIt's not my favorite Assassin's Creed game, but it is my favorite pirate game.","February 24, 2014","true","85.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your health also just regenerates by itself and it doesn't seem to matter how many times you've been shot or slashed. Also, they removed alot of features that were in AC2, AC Brotherhood and AC Revalations like when you had to pay money to unlock shops, you need to go to doctors to heal, canoes (Which could've been rowing boats in AC4 if it was added) and making your own bombs like on AC Revalations. I'd give the game a 7.5/10.","February 25, 2014","true","148.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wasn't even hyped for this so it took me by surprise how amazing the game was.\n\nYou don't play as an honorable character, or a character driven by revenge. Edward Kenway is driven by money and the persuit of more money! A nice change to see things from another perspective.\n\nCombat is more fluid than AC3 but also made hard again like AC1. And I don't mean hard as in big tough guy who blocks everything you throw at him (those guys were cheap in AC3), but you have to plan your way out of situations. Take out the small fry, let the Captain ready his gun and then use the Brute as a human shield and finish the Captain. Then escape!\n\nThe ship side of things is sooooo awesome. They took what was good in AC3 and expanded on it. More attacking methods and lots of nautical terms which is nice. And due to the open world nature of the game, you can get off of your ship and explore an island and while you are on it you can hear a random ship battle between Spanish and English ships out at sea.\n\nThe story like all AC games keeps you coming back for more and the modern day aspect has been reduced to very little if you don't like that side of things. Or if you do like the modern day angle, lots of exploration and discovery. Basically its there if you want it and can be ignored if you don't.\n\nI could go on saying much more; basically this game is worth the purchase.","March 30, 2014","true","109.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Leaving the stealth elements to a bare minimum and focusing on naval combat and exploration of the caribbean makes this a worthwhile standalone game if not very assassin's creed-y one. The present time storyline manages to be little more than an anchor hindering your progress through the game and its passable actual story and characters. To quote Deadpool: "He's not here ten seconds before he starts boring us with his dire warning-from-the-future crap!" Seriously Ubisoft, just drop it and pretend it never existed and everyone will be happy. Other than the story, combat is entertaining enough for the duration of an average playthrough but is a bit on the easy side again, an issue that seems to haunt AC games for all eternity. It looks very cool and the finishers feel satisfyingly brutal, but it really needs some challenge to it. Best point of the game is definetly the naval combat, which feels pretty epic and took the majority of my playtime. Boarding the ships is okay, what with the occasional, no wait, constant crew members hacking you in the back and generally being in the way of cleaning the deck effectively. But despite its many flaws I had fun with this title, more so than previous AC's. Maybe not worth the launch price which I paid but good game overall.","November 17, 2014","true","36.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only drawbacks that I saw were that at times you were limited with collections due to not being able to access an area, such as the Mayan Stones, Yes, the reward was nice for completing this collection, but I felt a little underwhelmed with it due to not being able to complete it until so late into the game.","November 24, 2014","true","120.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The real eye-candy are the islands that are literally everywhere on the world map. Even the small, miniscule islands are absolutely gorgeous and are worth exploring. The water, the weather, the day/night cycles, everything graphical in this is just amazing to look at.\n\nAnd the main character is finally likable in an AC game again. Connor in AC3 was just annoying to me, so Ezio was the last really likable character in the series. Edward is a bit of an anti-hero, but that's what makes him likable. Not only is the acting done really well, but he has no issues with doing what he pleases for whatever he wants...as you would expect a pirate to be like.\n\nSo yes, great title and very worth the buy","November 23, 2014","true","49.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Arrgh. ;)\n\nHowever - There are plenty of problems as well.\n\nFirst of all, Uplay - What the F*** Ubisoft?\nIf you force people to use your software, please, make sure it actually works without problems. My installation works OK, haven't had much problems, but pretty please, don't ever gamble with peoples save game files - I've lost count of all the discusssions I've already seen about lost saves. (!)\n(Oh and with a game offered on Steam, could you also consider not having the same default hotkeys for some actions, like screenshots, as Steam has?)\n\nSecond, No Ubisoft, NO! Bad boy. You DO NOT SELL cheats and timesavers as DLCs. That's just wrong, and takes away much from the actual gaming experience.. It is an accepted part of games like this one, that you should either waste your time playing right, or waste your time cheating on Google. It is all a vital part of the complete experience.\nI've also seen plenty of people wondering how to deactivate their purchased cheats, after they've made the MISTAKE of activating a cheat pack. ( I'm not one of them, don't know if there is a way to do this?)\n\nThird, a game still actively sold and supported as far as I know, should really be a finished and polished product by TWO YEARS after release. But NO... There are some crazy bugs out there, like for instance - Today I was carrying out an assassination contract. Killed everyone I found in the target area, but did not find my target. Tried this for multiple times, until I decided to try and drown myself. Strangely, that helped. o_O The target appeared.\n\nDon't want to go on whining, so I'll just end this by saying that this actually is a great game,\nbut be prepared for all sorts of small glitches and problems, and keep in mind you are likely to end up seeing some crazy s**t that's (hopefully) not there by design, before you've reached 100% in game.\n\n\n\nP.S.\n\nPOSSIBLE SPOILER:\nI was really disappointed to see we only got a glimpse of some of the most interesting characters in the game, before we lose them for good. I would have wished to see much more of Blackbeard and Mary.

Ship combat feels easy and challenging at the same time. Ship boarding is great way to test your melee combat skills and tactics. On land combat and activities feel same old "Assassiny", that get boring after a while, island exploring is sometimes challenging for no reason, making full exploration a pain to do, when you can't seem to locate one particular chest.\n\nStealth "bush" system is great new addition to the tactics, and add some stealth element to rather boring town combat/exploration. The pirate story side is really great apart from boring Assassins and Templars for the 4th time. There's lack of melee and ranged weapon variety, and once you get couple thousand R (money), you don't have to invest in those.\n\nPersonal gadget upgrades are a nice touch to make you hunt for specific animals and their hides/bones. Ship upgrades are really nice, and require you to obtain cloth, wood and metal for them via sea battles, apart from R (money) and schematics. All around it's a nice pirate game, even if it's the same old Assassin's Creed under the cover.","August 15, 2015","true","28.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nov 18) and boy has it been worth it. I have never played any of the previous assassin's creed games, but I believe I picked the perfect one to start with. I am totally enamored with it. The ship to ship combat is easily my favorite part of this game, and on many an occasion I have fistpumped with my virtual crew on the successful boarding of a larger Spanish or British ship. In short... this game brings out the pirate in me! ARR!\n\nI have run into little to no bugs at all in the game, and it runs fine on my system, especially with the big screen as my main monitor, and the surround sound. I am pretty sure the neighbors think I am conquering the block, and probably expect me to swing through their windows any minute, yelling "Heave to, mi hearties!"\n\nI have yet to try the pvp aspect of it, as I am not much of a pvp player, but I am loving the heck out of the story mode, even the parts in the Montreal office. Well designed game, well written story, highly immersive. All of the characters I have encountered thus far have a certain charm to them, including the one I am playing, Captain Kenway. I have been posting pictures of my adventures on facebook, and I may even blog about it in the very near future, or at least post some youtube videos.\n\nHats off to the crew at Ubisoft who put this game together, as it was just what I needed to scratch my looting and pillaging itch!","November 26, 2013","true","149.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have spent forty-two hours in this game and I've only managed to get through maybe a little under half of the main storyline. The reason for this is the vast amount of gameplay to be found. In previous AC games I would beat the game first and then go through and unlock everything. However, this game is so good that I havn't been able to stop doing the extra side missions in order to finish the game. Needless to say, that is the highest praise that I think can be laid at the feet of any video game. So enjoy, this is amazing.\n\nOn the other side of things I do want to point out that there are some glitches: few and far between thankfully.

A new Assassins Creed only a year after the last one... Bet this is going to be like Call of Duty. I was pretty happy with Assassins Creed (AC) 3 singleplayer. The story was desent, and the maps were pretty good - but like with all other AC games, I never got into collecting or multiplayer.\nI desided to go around AC4, 'cause how can it be any good so close to the last one?\n\nI had my birthday just after New years, and desided to try out AC4, due to good reviews.\n\nAnd boy was i pleasently suprised! First of all, they cut back on all that Animus crap from the other games, so that was a great suprise.\nThe story is "okay", nothing like AC1 or AC2, but good enough to keep you moving forward.\nYou play a pirate that engages in navelcombat with a random boat, that has an Assassin onboard. You both end up on the beach, and after abit of learning the movements and combat, you end up killing him and taking his clothes. Turns out he was a traitor, and you use this for personal glory. I wont spoil it all here :)\n\nThe big thing in the game is the sailing. And do it deliver big time. I love roaming the sea, having my crew sing different songs, and plundering innocent merchant ships from Spain or Great Britain. The naval combat functions really well, and it is easy to switch between weapons, controling the ship and boarding other vessels.\nIts so much fun, that after reaching Act 8 (of 13) i totaly forgot about the story and just went around plundering and upgrading my ship.\nAfter a while I desided to get back to the story, and finished it rather quickly. But the game wouldnt let me go there.\n\nAfter finishing, I really wanted to collect stuff. You can see on your map, when a location has been depleted of all activity (it turns yellow). And it didnt take long for me to make them all turn yellow!\nThe most tedious part was the diving missions, because you have very limited movement and time (and no weapons). But ive heard from others they found them to be the most thrilling parts of the game...\n\nIve now fully upgraded my ship, got a badass Mayan (bulletproof) Armor and almost collected everything in the game. Ive spent 60+ hours, and was very entertained all the way.\n\nAnd on a end note, may I recommend watching the Black Sails (starz) serie that is currently running in between gameingsessions, just to keep the mood going! :D\n\nTL:DR; Desent singleplayer, great navalcombat and really adictive!

Playing as a pirate, exploring the beautiful seas and islands, made me feel like a kid again.  The thrill of stalking an enemy fleet, launching a surprise attack with heavy mortars and a broadside fusillade of cannon fire, and boarding the crippled ships to seize them in hand-to-hand combat never got old.  I felt like the heroic Errol Flynn in his legendary pirate movies!\n\nAC4’s story wasn’t fantastic, but it was the best one in this franchise after the original AC2.  The protagonist in AC4 is eminently likeable, a charismatic and tough-but-caring rogue far more like AC2’s flamboyant Ezio than AC3’s boringly stoic Connor.  The characters in AC4, particularly some of history’s most-famous pirates, were generally a lot of fun.  And the modern-day Animus hokum that rips you out of the meat of Assassin’s Creed games was thankfully kept to a minimum.  Most of the out-of-Animus activities, which were actually the most entertaining of the series, were fully optional in AC4.  I’m glad the developers are hearing us that the modern-day stuff in Assassin’s Creed is a jarring waste of time.\n\nThe missions are classic Assassin’s Creed, with lots of tailing, stalking, assassinating, and escaping after the deed.  The optional objectives in missions were much more manageable than some in AC3, generally achievable without excessive retries.  There is also the option to restart missions at checkpoints within them, rather than at the beginning.  That made the game a lot less frustrating for people like me who want to get all objectives but don’t have tons of time to play games.  Tailing sections in some missions were used to advance the dialogue, which I enjoyed much more than just watching a static cut-scene.  Using stealth-craft to tail targets unseen was often a fun challenge.\n\nThe hand-to-hand combat is excellent, easily the best of the series yet.  The animations of our hero and his enemies are exquisitely fluid, with natural transitions between different moves and when switching between enemies.  Unfortunately the weapon options were dramatically reduced from AC3, to essentially just hidden blades, dual swords, and pistols.  The explanation given was pirates prefer a sword in each hand, but it would have been nice to have the larger weapon set from previous games.  You could still disarm enemies to take different kinds of weapons, but they got dropped soon after combat.  The combat isn’t up to Batman Arkham’s stellar standards, but it is still a lot of fun.  Particularly in ship situations, swinging from ropes on the masts to jump into the middle of a scrum and massacre all.\n\nThe ship-to-ship combat was utterly amazing, AC4 is easily the best pirate game I’ve ever played and this is coming from a lifelong gamer born in 1974 who started gaming on an Apple ][.  The seas are absolutely beautifully rendered, with the ships acting realistically on the waves with the exception of faster responses than possible in the real world.  The tactics of naval combat can actually be quite deep, such as approaching enemies from the stern to deny them a broadside shot at you.  Blasting enemy ships to splinters with cannons just never gets old, and boarding them to steal their cargoes to upgrade your own ship is very satisfying.  The seas are lousy with ships, so there are always plenty to fight, board, and loot at every turn.\n\nThe open-world exploration aspect of AC4 dramatically expands on AC3, and was very addictive.  Between missions you can sail wherever you want whenever you want with virtually no restrictions, discovering new villages, smugglers’ coves, and even underwater shipwrecks.  There are many local assassination missions, which are short and sweet and fun if you like remaining undetected until the killing stroke.  There are tons of collectibles that unlock everything from ship upgrades to new weapons and armor to cheats to multiplayer customization options, and I was surprised how compelled I felt to get absolutely all of them.  That isn’t hard, as after conquering naval forts commanding the open seas or scaling traditional viewpoints in cities the collectibles all appear on the map.  Most are easy to get, and satisfying to collect.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend AC4 to any fans of this series, and any fans of the oceans, tall ships, the golden age of pirates, or classic naval combat.  I hoped to get 30 hours out of this game, but it was so fun and addictive I nearly doubled that.  While I still think AC2 probably had the best story of the series, AC4 is the best game hands-down.  It is amazing how great this game is considering it only took a year (albeit with a huge team) to produce and came right after the middling-in-many-regards AC3.  It is a strong buy at any price below $30.  Enjoy me trumps!","January 20, 2014","true","58.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll keep this simple, Pros and Cons:\n\nPros\n\n-Sailing. Between the ambient sounds, the crew singing, and random events, it's exciting, and even soothing.\n\n-Naval combat. Much refined from AC3, simpler even with added features. And much more exciting.\n\n-Pirating. I was glad to see the pirating had a purpose, after all, you have to have some way to obtain the wood, metal, and money needed for those shiny new broadside cannons you want.\n\n-Open world. Huge world, many places to discover and explore. Which brings me to the next pro.\n\n-Fast travel. With a world that big you need a good fast travel system for those who use it. Not only does each place have a fast travel option, but every synchronization point is its own fast travel.\n\n-Graphics. The game is beautiful. While things like hair looking a little flat, and rain popping indoors aren't very impressive, the rest of the world definitely is.\n\n-Voice acting. Top notch.\n\n-Music. Some of the sea shanties, and tavern songs still get stuck in my head from time to time. And I even YouTube a few, just to hear them again.\n\n-Present day missions. The Desmond missions left much to be desired. But I found these missions very interesting, and fun. I would actually look forward to the next mission.\n\n-Story. Some don't agree, but I liked it. It was a change of pace. The main character wasn't hell bent on revenge, he was a pirate after the next big payday. The story got more and more intriguing as time went on.\n\n-Crafting/Upgrades. Always fun to upgrade your character/gear. Especially seeing the changes affect the look of the Jackdaw.\n\n-Kenway's Fleet. Fun and rewarding mini game.\n\nThe next pros, are also cons. And each point will be explained in the appropriate section.\n\n-Game play. Had some very fun missions, utilizing each of the game's strengths.\n\n-Combat. The fighting was fluid, and simple. A little to simple for some, but still fun nonetheless.\n\n-Weapons. You have your usual swords, hidden blades, and guns. But they added the blow gun, which with it's sleep, and berserk darts came in handy all throughout the game.\n\nCons\n\n-Game play. Way too many tail and eavesdrop missions for my taste. Yes it's a stealth-ish game. But some just seemed to not be properly implemented, and just down right frustrating.\n\n-Combat. Seemed watered down from AC3. Which in my opinion was some of the coolest finishers I've seen. And you get like a fourth of them in AC4. And the slow mo finishes didn't have sound, which took away from the epic-ness for me.\n\n-Weapons. Again, watered down from AC3. There's no slot for a heavy weapon. And even though there are different types of each weapon, the guns are the only one you actually can notice a difference in. Also you don't get the rope dart till towards the end of the game.\n\n-Shipwrecks. Can be frustrating, the main downfall for me was not having a defense for the ridiculous amount of sharks congregating in the area.\nThis next con was the biggest for me, and it might not be the games fault, it could just be mine.\n\n-The glamor just kind of wore off. I reached a point where money was no longer an issue, and my character, and ship were fully upgraded. So that just left the story. And with annoying tail and eavesdrop missions after another I eventually got turned off and stopped playing for a while. I actually felt obligated to finish it because I paid $60 for it and wanted to see how it ended.\n\nAgain, that could just be me. Y'all might not run into that problem. But one thing I have noticed, is starting after Brotherhood, my in game hours have been dwindling for every new installment of the AC series. It could be the way the games are being made now, or again it could just be me.\n\nEverybody has their own opinion, and I'm just giving you mine. And my opinion on this game, is that it is definitely worth a buy. And a must have during a big sale.\n\nIt's not my favorite Assassin's Creed game, but it is my favorite pirate game.","February 24, 2014","true","85.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the combat system (Not the naval combat) is way too easy, so easy that you don't need to buy any new weapons for your character as I went through the entire game without buying any new swords or pistols... so that then makes the stores in the game useless. Your health also just regenerates by itself and it doesn't seem to matter how many times you've been shot or slashed. Also, they removed alot of features that were in AC2, AC Brotherhood and AC Revalations like when you had to pay money to unlock shops, you need to go to doctors to heal, canoes (Which could've been rowing boats in AC4 if it was added) and making your own bombs like on AC Revalations.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Angra1Mainyu/recommended/242050/","Angra1Mainyu","57Ω|2^^\/3η63|2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Angra1Mainyu/","19 products in account","Okay, I'll try to write down my commentary to AC4 (comparing it sometimes to AC3 too), remember that it is MINE OWN opinion, so it might vary from yours (though I will try to judge fairly). Minor spoilers awaiting!\n\n*****Concept*****\nThe idea of Edward Kenway is... kind of weird. I'm not against it, but not on it either. Yes, he might be the one that have some genes in him or anything that makes him being able to do all the assassin's feats while being a simple pirate from the beginning and NEVER pass training like previous characters (that stuff took Connor some years if I remember correctly). But also you'll never see in these games a lot of such people, so why there can't be one? It kind of makes sense though.\nAlso it is original, apparently thought through and looks cool! But still that's a little weird...\n*****Storyline*****\n"Main missions" in the game, which I consider as storyline, I found rather short. Yes, I mean that I do not really like that there's too little story missions in the game. But when I finished the story and looked on Steam to see how much time I spent on this - Oh my god - it's been about to 211 hours! Total sync was, like, 61% I think (did a lot of side activities too, like missions in town, upgrading the ship and character, looting chests and etc). So when I summed it up, it was clear that those hours just flew by - I liked it a lot. But still, I think some measures not to be able to rush down the story would be ok (like, making story mission appear only after certain time spent on side-activities or such, but even better would be making story just longer). I don't really know, but I recall that AC3 had much more main missions, or they were longer. But at the same time, I do like the Storymode overall. Even though it was a too fast adventure, I "liked" or "really liked" all the missions except one (not gonna spoil it though), because they all are well-made and aren't empty: there's a lot of action in every of them. So, I could basically just not rush it down and try to be more patient in the game, basically, there's might be no wrong in the story mode at all.\n*****Combat System*****\nCombat in AC4 was harder than one in AC3. And I really do like it. Back in the previous game, I was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about how easily you can slash people down, how op counters are and how useless is parry. Now, when the slow-mo in counter is gone and you can no longer counter Brutes attack (you always dodge 'em), the combat became far harder. Also the Human Shield mechanic and idea of gunners is also splendid - it made combat actually challenging, but maybe not too much (yet if you think about it, why would it be hard combat if you fighting, like, one against ten people? That'll be too hard). I also still think that parrying is rather useless, unfortunately, but it was buffed and, in vary rare situations, it actually helped me, so it's not hopeless. And the thing that I actually missed in this game that is arsenal. AC3 had MUCH more different types of weapons and had more tools, so I was expecting this in AC4, but it didn't come true, sadly. However, new mechanics (like, four pistols and darts, as well as new shenbao (rope dart) are cool). Combat in the seas is even more challenging that the one on earth. It is kinda making no sense that you can aboard one of five ships you fight, and other ones will do nothing, while after that you repair your ship because of boarding and fighting like a god damn vampire-ship-thingie (on other side without this strategy you do not survive grand battles against strong opponents). I don't approve that idea. But in 1v1 fights overall navi combat is nice, though I don't really see use for chain missiles. I also was dissapointed about maximum of infamy your Jackdaw may reach. I really hoped this cap was far higher, so at it's peak you'll be hunted by legendary hunter or something. Overall, I think that combat system needs some more tweaks, but mostly it is fine and entertaining.\n*****Stealth System*****\nStealth is the great part of AC games, but in this game i found Social Stealthing in the Single Player being freaky and mostly ineffective when stalking zones are overpowered. In Multiplayer, reverse is true: haystacks are mostly useless, while social stealthing is too useful. The mechanic that you move with the crowd in MP should have been also in SP, otherwise you need to speed up from time to time to keep up with crowd and it makes already hilarious stealthing even more broken. So, AC4 is rather "stealthing" game than "social-stealthing", as it was used to be. But overall the mechanics became better compared to AC3. It now makes a little more sense - standing in the crowds in AC4 became better (by means of animation and that's not too laughable right now by realistic means), and stalking "in the wild" is keeping up, too (AC3 bushes made no sense - you CAN'T hide in so thin vegetation, but AC4 is almost perfect in these means). The AI of enemies is still lacking and very badly at some points (not too buggy but mostly irrealistic), yet overall I think it is on right course.\n*****Side activities*****\nThe Assassin's Creed 4 contains a lot of side activities, including harpooning, collecting stuff, side missions and so so on. The first thing I experienced about that - side missions - vary in the game and are a little less exciting than ones in AC3. Still, pretty enjoyable and so they are fun (Templar Hunt is like a little story line which I appreciate very much). Fleet, however, is a great failure for me. A minigame? Are you kidding me? This is a FLEET. I really am dissapointed about that, I thought it'd be far more epic. However, Diving is also very exciting, but sometimes a little to hard (for example, hint about new hostile creature in the seas appeared only after it hit me. How's that fair?). Still is well made activity. Harpooning is very enjoyable though - you need to charge, to aim harpoon, to counter attacks of the prey by interrupting it and stuff. About collecting... Well... I am not a fun of this type of things yet they did not annoy me too much in AC4. Actually, if you'll try to collect them while sailing somewhere you actually would like to sail (we're passing by, why not stop for a three minutes or so?), they are ok. But the way they are in the world... It's a pain, but the best I can imagine them to be. They are spread in the world, but strangely - seems to be close, yet you need to drop to the island, collect stuff, jump again to the ship, sail to the another location for a little while, repeat. That's how you collect them. Even if you do it only when it's not so hard to do, it still is a painful thing to add into the game - even the chests ain't worth picking up by the loot they have inside (cargo standing on the ground won't worth a single button pressed for them). That makes collecting stuff for me purely rating-challenge based activity, where you  ladder up above some people you don't even know. But yeah, those three chests probably will move you upwards on ladder for 1 000 people who do not care about such stuff. Yaaay. Much pride. So wow. However, collecting some things from different sources (treasure maps and diving for example) gives you plans for your ship to make it stronger or some other huge bonuses, making collecting somehow useful too. So, the side activities mostly do give you some in-game stuff after the story mode, yet it might be boring and also ain't endless.\nI wanted to tell more, but that's limit of symbols. Overall - recommend.","January 25, 2014","true","270.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also keep in mind that this is my second AC game and the only other AC game I played was Brotherhood, so obvously my review can be a bit biased as I could only compare to that game which was released 3 years ago.","December 31, 2014","true","59.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The open world, endless objectives and engaging storyline really put this game ahead of the curve. I have also played other creed games such as 3, and I think that while there are many similarities, this game is still better. Also, I loved how the game was based around the boat, that was a great idea, granted the storyline is about pirates so there had to be a ship somwhere, but the extent to which it was intergrated was amazing. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the creed series or even if your a newcomer.","January 16, 2014","true","64.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Invested around 40 hours into it, where most time was spent in sandbox mode attempting to become the greatest pirate on the seve... hmm.. one sea!\n\nOn a sidenote, the story was less frustrating and confusing with a smaller focus on the Astergo trouble.\nI'd definitely recommend this for anyone who enjoyed parts of any assassin's creed game.","April 6, 2014","true","44.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A new Assassins Creed only a year after the last one... Bet this is going to be like Call of Duty. I was pretty happy with Assassins Creed (AC) 3 singleplayer. The story was desent, and the maps were pretty good - but like with all other AC games, I never got into collecting or multiplayer.\nI desided to go around AC4, 'cause how can it be any good so close to the last one?\n\nI had my birthday just after New years, and desided to try out AC4, due to good reviews.\n\nAnd boy was i pleasently suprised! First of all, they cut back on all that Animus crap from the other games, so that was a great suprise.\nThe story is "okay", nothing like AC1 or AC2, but good enough to keep you moving forward.\nYou play a pirate that engages in navelcombat with a random boat, that has an Assassin onboard. You both end up on the beach, and after abit of learning the movements and combat, you end up killing him and taking his clothes. Turns out he was a traitor, and you use this for personal glory. I wont spoil it all here :)\n\nThe big thing in the game is the sailing. And do it deliver big time. I love roaming the sea, having my crew sing different songs, and plundering innocent merchant ships from Spain or Great Britain. The naval combat functions really well, and it is easy to switch between weapons, controling the ship and boarding other vessels.\nIts so much fun, that after reaching Act 8 (of 13) i totaly forgot about the story and just went around plundering and upgrading my ship.\nAfter a while I desided to get back to the story, and finished it rather quickly. But the game wouldnt let me go there.\n\nAfter finishing, I really wanted to collect stuff. You can see on your map, when a location has been depleted of all activity (it turns yellow). And it didnt take long for me to make them all turn yellow!\nThe most tedious part was the diving missions, because you have very limited movement and time (and no weapons). But ive heard from others they found them to be the most thrilling parts of the game...\n\nIve now fully upgraded my ship, got a badass Mayan (bulletproof) Armor and almost collected everything in the game. Ive spent 60+ hours, and was very entertained all the way.\n\nAnd on a end note, may I recommend watching the Black Sails (starz) serie that is currently running in between gameingsessions, just to keep the mood going! :D\n\nTL:DR; Desent singleplayer, great navalcombat and really adictive! A must buy for every Assassins Creed fan!","January 30, 2014","true","82.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Playing as a pirate, exploring the beautiful seas and islands, made me feel like a kid again.  The thrill of stalking an enemy fleet, launching a surprise attack with heavy mortars and a broadside fusillade of cannon fire, and boarding the crippled ships to seize them in hand-to-hand combat never got old.  I felt like the heroic Errol Flynn in his legendary pirate movies!\n\nAC4’s story wasn’t fantastic, but it was the best one in this franchise after the original AC2.  The protagonist in AC4 is eminently likeable, a charismatic and tough-but-caring rogue far more like AC2’s flamboyant Ezio than AC3’s boringly stoic Connor.  The characters in AC4, particularly some of history’s most-famous pirates, were generally a lot of fun.  And the modern-day Animus hokum that rips you out of the meat of Assassin’s Creed games was thankfully kept to a minimum.  Most of the out-of-Animus activities, which were actually the most entertaining of the series, were fully optional in AC4.  I’m glad the developers are hearing us that the modern-day stuff in Assassin’s Creed is a jarring waste of time.\n\nThe missions are classic Assassin’s Creed, with lots of tailing, stalking, assassinating, and escaping after the deed.  The optional objectives in missions were much more manageable than some in AC3, generally achievable without excessive retries.  There is also the option to restart missions at checkpoints within them, rather than at the beginning.  That made the game a lot less frustrating for people like me who want to get all objectives but don’t have tons of time to play games.  Tailing sections in some missions were used to advance the dialogue, which I enjoyed much more than just watching a static cut-scene.  Using stealth-craft to tail targets unseen was often a fun challenge.\n\nThe hand-to-hand combat is excellent, easily the best of the series yet.  The animations of our hero and his enemies are exquisitely fluid, with natural transitions between different moves and when switching between enemies.  Unfortunately the weapon options were dramatically reduced from AC3, to essentially just hidden blades, dual swords, and pistols.  The explanation given was pirates prefer a sword in each hand, but it would have been nice to have the larger weapon set from previous games.  You could still disarm enemies to take different kinds of weapons, but they got dropped soon after combat.  The combat isn’t up to Batman Arkham’s stellar standards, but it is still a lot of fun.  Particularly in ship situations, swinging from ropes on the masts to jump into the middle of a scrum and massacre all.\n\nThe ship-to-ship combat was utterly amazing, AC4 is easily the best pirate game I’ve ever played and this is coming from a lifelong gamer born in 1974 who started gaming on an Apple ][.  The seas are absolutely beautifully rendered, with the ships acting realistically on the waves with the exception of faster responses than possible in the real world.  The tactics of naval combat can actually be quite deep, such as approaching enemies from the stern to deny them a broadside shot at you.  Blasting enemy ships to splinters with cannons just never gets old, and boarding them to steal their cargoes to upgrade your own ship is very satisfying.  The seas are lousy with ships, so there are always plenty to fight, board, and loot at every turn.\n\nThe open-world exploration aspect of AC4 dramatically expands on AC3, and was very addictive.  Between missions you can sail wherever you want whenever you want with virtually no restrictions, discovering new villages, smugglers’ coves, and even underwater shipwrecks.  There are many local assassination missions, which are short and sweet and fun if you like remaining undetected until the killing stroke.  There are tons of collectibles that unlock everything from ship upgrades to new weapons and armor to cheats to multiplayer customization options, and I was surprised how compelled I felt to get absolutely all of them.  That isn’t hard, as after conquering naval forts commanding the open seas or scaling traditional viewpoints in cities the collectibles all appear on the map.  Most are easy to get, and satisfying to collect.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend AC4 to any fans of this series, and any fans of the oceans, tall ships, the golden age of pirates, or classic naval combat.  I hoped to get 30 hours out of this game, but it was so fun and addictive I nearly doubled that.  While I still think AC2 probably had the best story of the series, AC4 is the best game hands-down.  It is amazing how great this game is considering it only took a year (albeit with a huge team) to produce and came right after the middling-in-many-regards AC3.  It is a strong buy at any price below $30.  Enjoy me trumps!","January 20, 2014","true","58.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are that kind of person and are intrested in a complete review, read on!\n\nOK. I'm going to write a complete review with PROS and CONS of this game. Before that let me say that Assassin's Creed is a game where you play as an assassin. You have your main mission but there is nothing saying that you can't wander off and cause trouble with the guards and what not. There are always side missions and the map is HUGE!\n\nPROS:\n\nEasy to pick up and play.\n\nCombat is simple with the attack+counter keys. You can also break an enemies defense or throw them. Why not?\n\nFree running is insane fun. Run up buildings or climb all the way to the top of the ship and plummit down to your death! Or if your precise you can land in the water! Why not?\n\nThe main missions are always fun, but if you somehow get tired of that you can go and travel+explore, or go try an assassination mission.\n\nGraphics are beautiful.\n\nGameplay is smooth and fun. You will never find yourself in a dull moment. Even the parts where you just stalk someone while listening in to their conversations sometimes lay in restricted zones and always are intense.\n\nSWORD FIGHTING!!!!!!!!! BLADE FIGHTING!!!!!!!!!!!! MUSKETS AND GUNS!!!!!!!!!!!!! WEAPONRY IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe ocean is a vast place! Take your boat anywere! Enter a restricted zone? Why not? Need crew or supplies? Raid an ememy boat and take their supplies! Take over a fort? Who says no!!!\n\nYOUR NOT JUST AN ASSASSINS. YOUR A FREAKING PIRATE!\n\nThere are so many more PROS in this game, that I recommend just buying it and finding out for yourself!\n\nCONS:\n\nThe multiplayer isn't the absolute best, although it is fun.\n\nThe game runs and feels like assassin's creed 3, but this should not stop you from buying this.\n\nYou can replay missions, but you have to replay the whole entire mission. For example. Say you want to replay the mission where you steal your first boat, then escape in bad weather with rouge waves and tornadoes. Before getting to the part where you drive the boat, you have to spend 30 minutes before hand finding your crew, and this can get annoying if you just want to drive the boat. (INSANE FUN IN THAT KIND OF WEATHER)\n\nI know that this has been going on for every game, but I think that you should be able to at least harm civillians. They are technically impervious to everything. It can get a little annoying not being able to just stab them. lol.\n\nYou can control all the cannons on either side of the boat when you drive it, but I think it would have also been cool if you could have controlled one cannon specifically. That option could have made the boat funner.\n\nThis took me a long time to write because this game is so much fun that I was having difficulty coming up with cons for the review :D\n\nSo go buy this game now.\n\nI really love it and I think everyone reading this will love it too.\n\n11/10","January 25, 2014","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
