Space Overlords by 12 Hit Combo reminds me of some of the games that were popular throughout my childhood. Had this game been released back then instead of today it might have been considered exquisite and the type of game that you the whole world knows about. Back then we didn’t care how basic a game was or how repetitive its gameplay proved to be because we lived in an era where the majority of games were so basic that they were forced to be that way. Unfortunately for 12 Hit Combo the times have changed and repetitive gameplay is generally frowned upon unless the mechanics are either so good or unique that we can look past them. Space Overlords fails to satisfy either one of those criteria and therefore we’re left with a game from a fantastic indie publisher – I really do enjoy working with Excalibur who we worked with for Perfect Universe – that has gone largely overlooked to the Steam crowd.\n\nSuch is the overlooked nature of this game that SteamSpy reports that between 88 and 1288 people own this game. I’d be surprised if that margin for error wasn’t much closer to the lower end of the scale than the other. Average playtime is just 19 minutes (factoring in that I’ve spent 4 hours as of writing with the game). Mind you this is a game that comes with the trading card program attached to it so people aren’t really playing it – or leaving it running – to milk the trading cards out of the game. It’s a sad story.\n\nIt’s not as though the game is devoid of potential. It has quite a bit. In fact, if the developers at 12 Hit Combo are continuing to work on their game and were to spice up the gameplay to not make it so repetitive it could be a title that could turn itself around quite easily. A little bit of variety would be fantastic. Their rampage and destruction has potential. There is a level editor that would be fun to design levels for friends with. The story at the moment is the highlight of the game and is a very nice transition to each level but by itself doesn’t change the repetitive gameplay.\n\nUnfortunately, because the game lacks a playerbase – the all-time peak of simultaneous players is 8 and most days peak at 0 or 1 – the multiplayer component of the game that looks like it could have a lot of potential is dead. Ainslie wasn’t interested in playing with or against me in local multiplayer so I haven’t been able to test out that either. But local co-op or multiplayer could be the way that Space Overlords makes it interesting. Like many of those older video games where the single player mode became boring very quickly but if you had a friend around the television with you you could spend several hours without thinking about boredom.\n\nUnless you have friends that you’d like to play with locally or more variety is input into the gameplay I cannot recommend Space Overlords. I wish I could but it’s just too repetitious.\n\nFor our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group","March 16","false","5.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

After all, to me, that’s kind of what the name implies. Yet, once I did a bit of research I saw it was basically a planetary-rampage romp of a game that looked like it was right out of the mid-to-late 1990s. The game comes to us from 12 Hit Combo and Excalibur Games, and it’s certainly a unique one, but how does it stack up after having dug into it for just over an hour?\n\nWell, the game is sort of a mixed bag in my book. On the one hand, it has an interesting story about a group of powerful beings known as the Overlords that watched over the universe until one of them betrayed the others, sealed them away, created their own race of beings, and used them to colonize every planet they could find and drain the resources to feed her growing power. One such overlord awakens after countless eons of rest and endeavors to destroy these followers and free her brethren. Yet, all of this is ultimately a lot of fluff because the main gameplay sees you traveling to various planets and having to destroy everything on the surface within a set amount of time (400 seconds). In many ways, the goal seems to be to survive and reach some kind of threshold, because in a couple instances I failed to destroy one or two buildings and still managed to advance to the next area.\n\nEach of the four selectable Overlords has their own strengths and weaknesses as well as special attacks they can deliver. The game also has multiplayer modes (not tested in my coverage) as well as a world-designer that you can use to build and share your own maps.\n\nThe graphics are definitely dated, giving me the vibe of Blast Corps on the Nintendo 64, and while that doesn’t count against my opinion on the game, I do find that it was rather unpolished. Typos can be found in various parts of the game, there are numerous instances of environmental clipping with the character models, and for a game about widespread destruction, the destruction seems rather tame and uninspired most of the time.\n\nUltimately, I think the game is okay, but for the asking price I’d likely stay away from it until it goes on a deep discount on Steam or you can get it as part of another bundle that has games you want in it.\n\nOn a scale from 0 to 10, with 5 being an “average” score, this game gets a rating of:\n\n----------------------\nMEH...... 4 / 10\n----------------------\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTNZGTY36Pw\n(Gameplay at 3440x1440)\n\nA review copy of "Space Overlords" was provided to me from Excalibur Publishing on behalf of the developers.","March 9","false","1.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

At first glance, Space Overlords seems decent at the beginning when you have a choice of picking overlords but unfortunately deals with a significant amount of issues. For instance, the story starts nicely but turns out to be quite generic and simple, followed by the repetitive gameplay in terms of destroying cities. Another issue I noticed was the lack of description in terms of buffs received. It usually resumes to one word which essentially you have to press and essentially guess what happens next. Another issue was the difference between overlords which is supposed to be based on stats but personally I would have never guessed due to the fact that each class seems to be the same. The game in a nut shell is kill all the buildings and destroy the attacking towers.\n\nThe multiplayer option unfortunately dissappointed me as well since I could not find a single match which means that I could not try it at all. This leads me to the conclusion that the players fanbase is literally non-existent. Overall, I think the game was most likely not ready to go live and I would not recommend it.\n\nFor our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group\n\n\n","May 6","false","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This does NOT affect my verdict of the game.\nI have not finished the story mode of the game so I'm only talking on game play right now.\nI made a game play video of this game on my YT channel Krisfire Here! -> https://youtu.be/CrUXlbmY1cQ\n\n(The small amount of story that is in the game opening) The Overlords created everything, and one of the Overlords sealed the others away to rule over the universe solo. That's all I got so far lol.\n\nThe game play is what I would call a beat-em-up destruction game; you control one of 4 Overlords, each with different powers, strengths, and weaknesses. You use them to destroy planets and colonizations made by the rogue overlords creations. There are different types of planets and different environments that each planet might have from an ice planet with lava ocean to a desert planet with an ice ocean. Each planet has different defensive systems. You get 4 different power ups that charge as you destroy things that you may also use to destroy more things.\n\nThe fighting is really fun, but gets repetitive really quick. I'm hoping as the game moves to the later levels it spices up.\n\nThe world creating is really cool as it lets the community build and create all sorts of different levels that can either be really easy...or really REALLY HARD!\n\nOverall the game is a fun game that gets slightly boring after awhile, but is a fun game to kill time.\n\n7/10 Good time killer.","March 3","true","0.9"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","9","19","3","0"
