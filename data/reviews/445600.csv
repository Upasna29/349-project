This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Note: Void Raiders is currently in Early Access. The version reviewed was released 17-MAR-2016 (including hotfix).\n\nVoid Raiders is a hectic science-fiction twin-stick shooter with rogue-like elements and great pixel graphics.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - Void Raiders has mostly great pixel graphics with a technological theme. It doesn't quite look like cyberpunk, but there's a definite sci-fi feel to everything. From the "Lone Invader Tavern" that makes up the sparse main menu, through the handful of different level styles, character and enemy graphics are solid quality and well animated, while levels are made up of interesting objects, albeit laid out in only a limited number of ways.\n\nOnce the action starts everything gets a bit hectic. All of the guns fire bright pulses of colour, rather than bullets, adding to both the science-fiction feel of the game and the action on screen. At first it feels a bit cluttered and overwhelming, but you get used to it after a while, and begin to appreciate the chaos all around you. The screen shake effect adds to the atmosphere.\n\nGraphics options are all but non-existent. You can change the severity of the screen shake, and there's a "not available yet" setting for particles, but you won't find resolution settings, levels of detail, or anything like that on the settings screen.\n\nSound - Original grungy techno music with a heavy beat infuses each level, encouraging the frantic action present in every level of the game. Sound effects are mostly good, with a few different gun sounds and suitably booming explosions. There is an odd beep, like the sound of a pinball bumper, that feels a bit out of place when you collect items, but overall sound is good.\n\nGameplay - Void Raiders is a frantic twin-stick shooter, with WASD for movement and mouse for aiming your character's gun and shooting, but unfortunately it doesn't yet support controllers (although that is a planned enhancement). You choose one of three characters, who all start out feeling pretty similar, and on each level you race around like a nutter blasting at anything that moves while you collect objectives and try to reach the elevator marking the end of the level.\n\nEnemies respawn frequently enough that you'll typically run out of ammo if you just try to stay still, so the game keeps you moving constantly, dodging incoming fire, evading melee enemies, and raining death around you. Enemies sometimes drop health, ammo, or cash. The first two simply top up your ailing health bar or increase your ammo reserves, respectively, while the third adds to your cash stash, enabling you to buy upgrades that increase statistics, or add some other beneficial effect. I think I've seen about a dozen such upgrades, but I don't know how many there are in total.\n\nYou can choose from one of three characters when you begin, and when you die (which will happen frequently), you can either continue on with your previous character (minus upgrades) or you can return to the Lone Invader Tavern and start again with someone else. The tavern also lets you spend skill points, earned through levelling up each of the three characters, on various skills and bonuses from each character's skill tree.\n\nThere's no tutorial for the game and instructions are minimal, so you may have trouble getting into it. Once you get the hang of it, though, and you've upgraded a character a couple of times, the game really starts to shine.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Great atmosphere\n+ Great pixel graphics\n+ Good soundtrack: both music and sound effects\n+ It's grindy, but it's fun grindy, due to the lasting character progression\n+ Different characters evolve to be significantly different to play after spending a few skill points, increasing replayability\n+ Achievements\n\nCons:\n- Only three characters, although there may be more coming\n- There's no story or introduction provided, so the characters' goals are completely unknown\n- It gets a bit repetitive; would be great with some more added goals or even character development side quests\n- Achievements seem to be a bit bugged, with some of the "Complete xxx level" achievements not always unlocking\n- Terrible quality writing for the in-game text (e.g. "ADD A DROP OF LEVANDAR TO YOUR BATH", or "ON NEPTUNE NOONE CARES YOU SCREAM", or the level called "MOANSTERY")\n- Still a few small interface issues, such as opening up the options menu when you have a character open in the tavern, or the tooltips being partially hidden by the mouse pointer (see screenshot in my profile)\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Void Raiders is a quality rogue-like shooter that, to me, is what Early Access should be all about. The core game is completed, and there's obviously been some fine tuning already performed, and a lot of effort and love put into it. It still needs more content and a bit more polish to really shine, but even as it is now in Early Access, I see no reason to not strongly recommend it. It's a fantastic, fun game.\n\n8/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","March 17","true","3.2"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","14","19","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boc_uma/recommended/445600/","boc_uma","boc_uma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boc_uma/","5 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhat attracted me to Void Raiders was its beautiful cyberpunk pixel art style. With the neon 80s retro futurism style (Which I'm always a sucker for) I was instantly addicted. Thankfully it’s not just a pretty face, going hand in hand with the graphics is the soundtrack. Clearly wearing its Synthwave/Dark Synth influences on its sleeve but mixing elements of Industrial rock and slicing in a Breakbeat edge it complements the hi-octane action perfectly.\n\nI know the difficulty has been mentioned a few times but I personally think it is set at the right, not too easy that it’s a walk in the park and not so hard its off putting to newcomers as the lovely little Goldilocks would say “It’s just right!”\n\nFor the price of the game I think there is a wealth of depth here and by the sounds of it will continue to expand on this in the future.  I know a few on here have compared it to other sweet indiegame shooters such as Crimsonlands, Hammerwatch and Nuclear Throne (and I can clearly see why) but for me It brings me back to the classics such as Gauntlet / Chaos Engine / Geometry Wars / Smash TV and even the granddaddy of the twinstick shooters Robotron but then again I am an old fart!\n\nHighly recommended guys if you need to feed your twinstick twitchiness :D\n","March 19","true","1.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Though it lacks plot or characterization of any kind at present, it has good enough music and spritework to convey a sense of style: a dark, neon-lit, occasionally rain-soaked metropolis on... Neptune?\n\nIt has three playable characters- Boris the Brawler, Tina the Gunslinger and Gudrun the Bladedancer, and of the three thus far I have had the most success with Boris, whose upgrades slowly turn him into a bullet-spewing tank. Tina puts out even more shots with her dual guns and has an entertaining special ability that causes her to spray bullets everywhere around her. Gudrun, with proper use of her blade-dashing and bullet-reflecting, is surprisingly survivable, and has a shotgun for when her sword isn't enough, but if you can't effectively use her sword to intercept incoming shots, she's by far the most fragile of the three.\n\nStages are split up into floors. On each floor you must obtain a certain number of key items, either these metal boxes with pink lights or these glowing green datacubes, before the elevator to the next floor becomes available. Enemies respawn endlessly, but you get xp for every kill. They drop cash, ammo and the occasional health pickup. Cash can be used to purchase stat-boosting (more damage, higher crit chance, health back on critical hits, etc) items from in-level vendors, one item per vendor, and you also get a choice of three items to buy between floors. However, you don't know what you're getting if you buy the in-level items, and in roguelike fashion, these items are lost when you die.\n\nThere's another review on here mentions the somewhat sluggish player movment, noting that you often have no choice but to "take the hits", and I'm inclined to agree, but if anything that's the game's only real shortcoming apart from not-yet-added features. However, I personally feel like the current level cap of 10 for each character is a tad low- admiteddly, leveling only gives you skill points, with the actual stat increases instead coming from upgrading your armor using components earned from defeating the bosses. I can only hope these upgrades have no cap, or at least a high one, as the game still becomes very difficult in later stages. Interestingly, I noticed that the difficulty increases not per stage but rather at certain time intervals in the length of your run- if you waste time, things will only get harder, but you might miss out on extra funding and items.\n\nI've played a lot of roguelikes and am glad to see another one with character experience and skills that carry over between runs. I hope that, like Rogue Legacy, or Galak-Z's arcade mode, victory in this game is an eventuallity, or at least a reasonable possibilty as in Ziggurat.","March 18","true","5.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I honestly was not expecting to much as it seemed a lot like a nuclear throne rip off or something along those lines and did not seem interesting at all, but i said "screw it let me try it and see how i like it!" and i honestly dont regret buying this. it is a really fun game to play and it gets fairly addictive.\n\nNow this isnt to say that it does not have its flaws. this is a early access game so of course there are bugs, i mean even in fully released games there are bugs everywhere. As of this game nothing is really hugely gamebreaking there are moments where u want to smash your keyboard in because of the annoyingness of some of the mobs but that is the fun part of this game. you dont really know what to expect really. As of this review there are only 3 characters, however with 2 customisable trees for each character it adds up to multiple fun ways to play the game. there definetly needs to be more characters / weapons / and levels because after a while killing the same mobs kinda gets old.\n\nOverall though the game is really fun to play so i rate this an 8/10 as far as it being a early access. I definetly recomend you to buy this if you have the $5 and want something entertaining. The creator responds to your feedback and takes into consideration what you say so i see this game having a promising future!\n","April 3","true","5.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

All the best stuff from my 80s and 90s arcade upbringing in one nice package, I haven't had this much fun since Ikari Warriors.  Do yourself a favor and buy it, and support this good effort.\n\nEdit:  I add this part at the end in case any other developers read reviews for other games to try to understand what makes something so popular or attractive to users.  I would say this developer pays an appropriate amount of attention to the visual effects, not so much that they ovewhelm or that the game loses focus, but it makes a really nice "paint job" on top of great mechanics (which seem very well-tweaked).\n\nA lot of other games, including ones I have bought but not played lately, seem almost to this level, but are just missing that extra variety in the color palette or visual effects to stay up to date with modern games.\n\nHere's a hint -- if the visuals on things like Bejeweled look head and shoulders better than your game, it needs some shine.  This developer used relatively low-pixel 8-bit style graphics and gave it the right shine to make it do its magic, with very simple yet effective art.  I consider this game to be a model for other developers in its class, and feel very happy with my investment, to the point that I have shown it to coworkers and family.  Kudos, and may your competition learn from your efforts.","April 4","true","4.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/445600/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo far so good. I already like this infinitely better than Nuclear Throne, which it is very similar to in terms of combat and weapon sounds, because it gives me a chance to not die quickly over and over again because it actually gives me some ♥♥♥♥♥ hit points. Nuclear Throne gives you 8. This game gives you 100+. That is the single only reason that I found NT challenging. Despite giving you so much hp, this game is challenging. Enemy bullets travel fast (too fast), enemies travel fast, and they respawn infinitely on each stage and they respawn often. And that is one of the biggest problems I have with this game is that enemy projectiles travel too fast. You cannot avoid gunfire and will always take massive amounts of dmg. It really does need to be toned down if they want this game to have any shelf life. And I'm not bad, most gunfire/lasers are just unavoidable. The objective is to collect four pink things in the level then the elevator is ready and you backtrack to it to go to the next stage. The game gets increasingly hard from very easy to hard and so on, exactly like in Risk of Rain. Another thing that makes it more enjoyable than Throne is that you can get permanent character skill upgrades, like crit chance and the ability to have a gundrone. K&M controls work great and you even get a nice red laser to help you aim in case you lose your crosshair in the action which you will like in most top down shooters.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are done well although they need to be cleared up because the rooms can get confusing as to what you can or cannot walk over/around. I am often wasting bullets shooting into a pillar that blends into the background or I have to try and decipher how I want to navigate a room while ten guys are wailing on me with lasers.\n\nSound/Music\nAwesome! I love the music and the gunfire booms loudly.\n\nThere are some things I hope get fixed up, like how on one stage I was staying locked in one room and running out of ammo because the little white ninja slice guys wouldn't quit respawning and running at me. They need to tone down those guys respawn rate and make them take a little less dmg to kill. Also when the girl character runs out of ammo she just simply wont fire but once every few seconds making her only useful if you have energy for her special move and get lucky and get a ammo drop. The other big problem is that end of level rewards are useless unless you can stack them multiple times. The problem is that the game gets hard very quickly so that's not going to happen and even if it could, end rewards are random. Double end level reward bonuses to fix this.\n\nIt's an early access game so of course it needs a lot of work, such as a better UI, better menus, more instructions, more options, more content, more coherent level design for less confusion, more clear item buying during a level so you don't miss it, character improvements, slow down enemy bulets, lessen respawn rate, more clear goals, more varied goals, explanation of why I need to use green build credits to enter certain side areas, and so on. So far they are on the right track and depending how much they put into this game it could turn out awesome.\n\n6.5/10 so far","April 3","true","3.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hemmingjay/recommended/445600/","hemmingjay","Hemmingjay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hemmingjay/","1433 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBliss.          Combine smash hit games Nuclear Throne and Risk of Rain and you get Void Raiders. There are two excellent systems at play that make this game work. First you have the temporary character upgrades/pickups during the gameplay. You are able to purchase one of three upgrades between randomly generated levels and these stay with you until you die. They are pickups such as a thorn halo that hurts enemies close to you or an increased critical chance. These are welcome but incremental, almost anemic, upgrades. They help once you stack 5 or more of each but initially they won't do you much good.\n\nThe second system that makes this game work is the permanent character progression. You start with 3 selectable characters and as you play with each they level up. Upon levelling up they get skill points that you can apply to two different skill trees for each character. These are serious improvements and you will likely die a lot at first with each new character. However, once you apply 2 or 3 skill points your character becomes a death-dealing, apocalypse wielding, mayhem spitting machine. To take it one step further for you progression junkies, there are 3 equipment upgrades as well. While beating levels you will earn four different resources and each hardware upgrade uses 2 different, very rare, resources. This will likely be the slowest upgrade path and it seems to be an odd choice at this point given that they appear to be fairly week changes.\n\nThis is early access though and the game isn't without it's potential improvements. To be a true classic it needs to tighten up the controls/responses. A real SHMUP needs lightning fast movement and tight controls. The game currently is a little swimmy and the shooting feels off, inaccurate. That might be due to the impossible cursor/aimpoint that is lost in the oversaturated graphics. I'm not a graphics snob and I love pixel art as much as the next guy but I find the lighting, color choice and minimalist art to hurt the experience a little. At the same time the individual art is charming at times and shows real talent. I just think the art direction could benefit from more consistent style and a little more restraint on light effects.\n\nI think this is a true gem in the making.

This is promising, and I'll keep playing and will keep my review up to date.\n---\n\nWait to buy and instead wishlist this game, for now. The price is totally great for the product given at this point, but if you are leary of anything that comes with Early Access, I'd totally wait. Although Void Raiders is its own thing, there is alot of influence of Nuclear Throne here (which is wayyy better at this point, but then again its been around a long time and basically created a subgenre spawning games like this one).\n\nEssentially, you get to choose out of three playable characters (more to come) which all have their own stats and unique weapons. Like Nuclear Throne you have a primary and secondary weapon. They all feel different which is good. The cool thing about the characters is that they have metagame permanent RPG-style level up ability with a small tech-tree that you can kind of choose how to build the character (its really limited, but fun none-the-less). Otherwise this is pretty much a spray-and-pray affair.\n\nPros:\n+Price is really cheap for the level of content.\n+The fun factor definately increases with time. It starts out really really slow.\n+Level up system is fun, although it needs to be modified - currently it can simply be boiled down to a 1st level grind. You can (and I did for a bit) just sit on the first level over and over to grind XP to level up. It may actually be the smart thing to do, idk.\n\nMeh:\n=For the boasting about the music, its ok, but considering all the great music in indie gaming; I wouldn't buy the soundtrack.\n=The pixel art can be a bit muddy at times. Sometimes its hard to know what is the top of a box and the side, etc. Sometimes the art overall is simple (in particular I am talking about the actual playable character models).\n\nCons:\n-Overall, the game needs more of its own identity. Yeah it seperates itself a bit from Nuclear Throne, but when it does, it mostly just goes into some other mechanic thats been done by some more successful game(s). This can be corrected.\n-Most importantly, your character is too slow and/or the bullets are too fast. Even with speed upgrades, many times I just have to take the bullets. There is no sprint or dodge-roll. It seriously eliminates alot of the strategy. It makes it brute force, when it should be anything but.\n-There is polish that could be easily done, that needs to be. For example, characters that are non-selectable at the moment should have a tool-tip that says 'coming soon' etc. It can be confusing. Shops apparently are also not available, although it looks like it. I mean, is it a glitch? Is it me? Are they available or not? It would take moments to make a tooltip for these situations. Its still not the best, but the developer's explained the shrines to me.\n-The level load times should be reduced (it breaks momentum), and the small 'cutscene' scanning the level is functionless and just wastes time. What are you trying to show us?\n-No options menu or graphics options, etc. Found this thanks to dev help\n-I get a bit of lag on both my gaming rig and mid-end laptop. No bigs, but it should be noted.\n\nIts cheap, and the content is there but needs further refinement. I will not refund or anything, and look forward to this game further seperating itself from competitors and really becoming its own thing.\n\nPeace,","March 17","false","1.5"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","13","25","5","0"

It's *okay*, but only just.  And it's not worth the price tag.  A lot of the game depends on "luck", which level you end up generating.  Sometimes you might get a very difficult first level and get destroyed, sometimes it'll be the second level, sometimes you'll make it to the boss.  I hate games that rely that much on luck though.  Hero Siege is much more fun, has more classes, more abilities, more replayability, and is cheaper.","May 8","false","1.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
