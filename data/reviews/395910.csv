So, actual game ~12 MB. The graphics resolution is 720p, quality ranges from bad Flash drawings to beaten-to-death-with-effects photographs. There are 18 backgrounds and 16 characters, but you'll only get to see about half of these because the game crashes as soon as you sell something to the baker. The voiceovers have amateur quality as well. I am calling this a visual novel because you can't really manipulate items in the environment; most of the gameplay is cutscenes and dialogue (but you do get a movable avatar in three scenes, animation is 4 frames).\nOne positive point: I can confirm that it will run (such as it can, seeing it crashes in the baker scene) on an old slow XP box.\n\nIt's a very incomplete amateur game. Don't pay money for this.","September 25, 2015","false","1.0"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","38","42","0","3"

No, of course not, even if it worked 3$ would be too much from what I've seen.","September 27, 2015","false","0.2"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

It is pretty short (under 10 minutes), art is okay, the whole thing is kind of something you would have seen on Newgrounds before.\nThe best part of the game was the business dude conversations which ended up making me laugh.\n\nI don't recommend buying it, instead just go watch the 5 min let's play of it.","November 27, 2015","false","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Everything screams rush job here. Some things are intentionally badly done (graphics notably), which is fine by me, but the UI is horrendous, some of the voice acting is painfully delivered through a faulty microphone, there's a crash at the baker shop (I managed to circumvent it by selling for $5 and then immediately leaving the shop), there is no save feature (all right, you can finish the game in less than 10 minutes but when you have to re-do it several times to get past that crash, it gets annoying), the inventory is ridiculous, and worst of all, you have to move with the arrow keys and bring up the inventory with the 'i' key, while the rest is done with the mouse... Sorry? You couldn't spend five minutes adding arrow icons to the left and right borders of the screen, and an Inventory icon in a corner?\n\nI liked Tokyo Hosto and even recommended it, and I had a few laugh at the silly conversations in here too. But at this point, it's just a ridiculous scam attempt, a project that was destined from the start to be bundled so the guy could make a few easy bucks and not have to worry about people asking for refunds. This would be enough to make you lose faith in the indie scene...","October 12, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
