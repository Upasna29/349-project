"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerebralpulse/recommended/325110/","cerebralpulse","Mio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerebralpulse/","3110 products in account","A very generic puzzle game, where mediocre could be said about everything in it - from graphics to sounds to gameplay.\nThe graphics in particular aren't very crisp, and sometimes I found myself lost between the foreground and background. Nothing really stands out as exciting, and while nothing is particularly bad, nothing about it is particularly good.\nI played the whole game in about 3hrs - probably more than the average person, as I initially wanted to collect everything, but gave up on this idea part-way through due to lack of interest.\n\nMight be worth playing if you like Lemmings, or similar style puzzle games, but not for full price - maybe a couple $.\n\nRecommended? Probably not, unless you want to play something truly, well, meh.","April 27, 2015","false","3.1"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","23","26","2","0"

This isn't it. It's just a cheap knockoff. The music is the same on every level. The Furries sound like Despicable Me minions (annoying) and the puzzles are too easy.\n\nI don't hate this game; I just don't like it very much. It feels way more dated than 3 years old. I would feel mucho cheated paying $7.\n\nI'd pay $0.50.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.
