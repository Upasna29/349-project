It’s a dream of a happy family sharing profound and eternal love. So does it even matter how much of it is true, and how much takes place in the forgetful mind of an old, possibly dying man who often forgets his own wife’s face and name, and the death of an only child? This story is a reminder of how true forgetfulness isn’t in the old, but in those young people who have forgotten that true love can never really end. After all, where would it go that we cannot follow, someday? (And the music is exceptionally nice.)\n\nThere may be no shortage of those saying that FNLAKN (which is by no means a game, but simply a story that moves at the reader’s own pace) is contrived, designed simply to provoke deep emotion. And it might be hard to argue to some extent, since it does do that very well. But it’s more than that. No doubt the meaning and value of this story resides largely in the heart of each reader, and will be interpreted very differently based on age and life experience. But for one ageing male gamer who married for the right reasons, however mistakenly and briefly, this is a story about the hope that even the simplest memories of love can be eternally (and eventually) redeeming. And that goodness and kindness can be those stepping stones we need to cross that last river. But mostly Forgotten, Not Lost – A Kinetic Novel is a reminder that no matter the number of powerful and sustaining memories age and dementia may take from our daily awareness, in whatever remaining part of our minds we continue to dwell those memories also reside, undiminished.\n\nIf readers wish to feel the heartbreak of dementia, and understand how too many people currently experience each day of their lives, FNLAKN is an excellent experience. As well, if you wish to understand caretaking of your own elderly family members, now or in the future, and this more regrettable possibility of your own future, again, this is a simple, short and inexpensive way to preview those prospects, in a hopeful manner. Or if you’ve simply lost love, and wish for the reassurance of its possible return, this may prove a very pleasant way to spend some time while warming your heart.\n\nThank you.\n\n(4m/s)\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)","April 3","true","0.2"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","31","32","0","2"

The 'game' tells a tale of an old man. I would say this is the most accurate representation of a Visual novel. There are no decisions to make, there is nothing to do but read. Hardly what I would consider a game, but to each their own I suppose.\n\nThe story is about dementia and it is interesting enough and it's not a bad story, just wasn't really great either. The graphics are alright, as is the music. Nothing special; nothing horrible.\n\nOverall: 5/10 I suppose.\nIt's not broken, it works.... though it requires some extra assets the first time you play. If you want a quick read then give it a go, I'd suggest getting it in a bundle or with a good coupon.\nIf you like VNs that just present a story to you, then you'll probably enjoy this. If not, stay away.\nI can't really not recommend it, as it does exactly what a VN is supposed to do, it's just not my personal cup of tea.","May 9","true","4.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

But then games like Forgotten, Not Lost - A Kinetic Novel are released showing how the medium can be used to deliver strong stories. While this title is more of a story than a game, with no choices to be made, it is still none the less an enjoyable experience with lovely artwork and music tying the tale together. I must warn you, it will tug your heartstrings.\n\nThe story is about an old man named Reynard who is suffering from memory loss, perhaps dementia or Alzheimer's, the game itself never says. He lives with his loving wife who helps take care of him and their home as the two enjoy their golden years. The story follows Reynard as he tries to recapture faded memories and prepare himself for the inevitable. The story is short but revealing much else might spoil things, I will say it is beautifully written and shows great insight into the mind of someone as they try to hold onto their most precious memories.\n\nThe artwork in the game is soft and gentle, matching very well with the tone of the story. There aren’t many characters in the game but each one has a lovely model to fit them. The game also has a few cutscenes which are of the same quality. The background music fits very well, relaxing and soothing as you follow along through the journey of memories. I found the game very aesthetically pleasing and found no issues with it. I would have loved to see more of the artwork, actually, especially seeing more illustrations of the old stories Reynard was telling.\n\nThe game mechanics are very simple. It’s a visual novel and all you have to do is sit back and read since it is the kinetic kind that doesn’t require any interactions. You can use your mouse to click through the lines of dialogue or set the game on autoplay if you’d rather just read and use your hands for other things, like I personally enjoy eating while reading a good visual novel. You can save you progress, adjust the text speed and many other basic options one would expect. The text is easy to read and the menus are very easy to maneuver through.\n\nI fully recommend Forgotten, Not Lost - A Kinetic Novel, as a heartwarming story that brought me to tears. It’s a very short experience, maybe an hour or two but it’s well worth it. The game also has trading cards and achievements that are easily obtained through the course of the story. I honestly have nothing negative to say about this game, I do wish it was longer however it accomplished its goals either way and I was left with a satisfying experience.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproduction.com]","April 16","true","12.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Now it's too late for me to visit her.\n\nI love this game, it made me feel like a horrible person, but I simply didn't have the heart to see my grandmother in such a terrible state. I'm so sorry.\n\nThe novel's full of simplistic, but still good, symbolism. Such as the different emperors of Memoria (pretty obvious ...), and of course, the characters that the main character interacts with through the story.\n\nThe ending can be interpreted in different ways, either as an afterlife or the main character's last dream before his death.\n\nI recommend this novel if you want to think while reading it, maybe about the past, just like the main character. It can be finished in an hour, maybe even less, but it will be worth it.","April 17","true","1.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Forgotten, Not Lost released on 2nd April 2016. The game costs £1.59 and the game is available for Steam. A press review copy was provided for The Hidden Levels.\n\nForgotten, Not Lost is a visual novel game which touches upon the difficulties of dementia and old age. You play as a farmer in the game who is simply forgetting more and more things and feeling the effects of dementia more and more as time progresses on. I don’t want to touch too much on the story because it is short and I do not want to spoil the pleasant experience I had with the game.\n\nPositives:\nArt Style and Direction – The art and backdrops to the game provide a good image to work around mentally. I loved the unique style of the characters (which fell more into an anime style) and found the art style to be well done and very consistent. I really enjoyed that the music backed up and really complimented the scenes.\nPrice – The price of the game is really low. For the price I cannot think of another alternative visual novel.\nSave slots – A lot of VN’s I have played have lacked spots to save the game. This game comes with a total of 38 save slots which is way more than what you’d need.\nTouching and emotionally packed – The game hit me right in the feels and this is where the game excels. If you can let your  barrier down and put yourself in the characters place you will find real emotions, confusion and happiness hit you many times.\n\nNegatives:\nLongevity – The game is short and not very long. This could be a downfall for a gamer searching for a visual novel of length. One play through was enough for me but it was enough and I felt satisfied after.\nName bars – Sometimes the names of the people speaking do not appear over the text box. When you character speaks there is no text box to indicate who is speaking which can get a bit confusing when it swaps to them speaking and there is no name indicator.\nConfusion – The game temporarily hit me with confusion, making me feel that I missed something. This was resolved however and I really feel this is not so much a negative. Just made me feel temporarily out of place.\n\nAfter seeing someone in my own family go through dementia this game for me was always going to be a touchy subject. The author of the story also based it off actual experiences caring for someone with dementia. I hope that this game raises a lot more awareness for Dementia and the difficulties people face going through it.\n\nThe game was short but I believe it was for the better, I really enjoyed it from start to finish and one of the quotes from the game page was “a visual novel that hopes to bring tears into our readers' eyes, especially those who have gone through similar situations when dementia or Alzheimer's has claimed the memory of a loved one.” – I would gladly say that this is backed up by me playing the game and around halfway through having tears flow from my eyes. This game may not be for everyone but if you are a fan of visual novels or wanting to find out more about the effects of dementia I wholeheartedly recommend this game. I had a great experience from playing the game and it will leave its mark on me for a while as a really good eye opener to ageing and dementia.\n\nIf you find it hard to connect emotionally to games or don’t really like Visual Novels or games where you don’t get any choices then I would not recommend. For everyone else though this to me is worthy of a purchase.\n\nScore: Buy it now!\n","April 2","true","3.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

No choices, no game elements, just a great read that will take most readers 30 minutes to an hour to read through completely.  I warn you however, that if you've ever seen anyone you love and care about change in their later years and become someone almost unfamiliar due to dementia or Alzheimer's,  have some tissues ready!  Yes.. even if you are a "heartless guy"!  Furthermore, I will make it known that I state right now that anyone who can genuinely read this entire short novel and not at least wet an eye simply doesn't have a heart, period.\n\nThere's nothing more I can add about the story that the details in the description and the preview video don't present better already.  I can say that this short novel was well worth the money to me, it's a finely written story that is likely to hit home for a lot of people.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meerreessm/recommended/457490/","meerreessm","Nobody","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meerreessm/","363 products in account","So basically this is not a game in the traditional sense, and if you're looking to play something with a gameplay element, then forget about it. The only interaction here consists of clicking the left mouse button, or pressing spacebar from the start to the end of the story. I'd generally categorize this under the 'kinetic novel' category instead of a game. It would be nice too if there's some element of choice in the story, but I understand that would probably blow the budget beyond the cheap price of this game.\n\nBeing aware of that however, if what you want is an EXPERIENCE, a nice story of how an old couple live together at the end of their lives (and beyond), then by all means, get this kinetic novel. I guarantee that this product comes with tons of chopping onions and will touch you deeply as tears flow -- especially if the characters in the story are people you can relate to. Arts is okay-ish and does the job, the music is excellent! Writing is decent. The nearest equivalent to this would be those $1 indie self-published books in the kindle store, but this one comes with a full multimedia experience of graphics and music too. I play it at night and managed to go through the story in about 30 minutes, and for what I paid, I consider it worth the money. It's also something I will definitely recommend to other people whom I know share the same taste as myself.","April 14","true","0.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Luckily, it all ends as it must, with a very touching and happy ending, despìte everything that goes by.\n\nI'm not going to spoil it for you, but if you're into touching stories and relatable characters, or even if you just have a little time to read a sweet story (just an hour or two of gameplay, depending on your reading speed) then this is for you. You won't be disappointed.\n\nThe music fits this  VN perfectly, and the art is also very soft on the eyes and fitting, gives you some sort of nice, cozy feeling when meshed altogether :)\n\nIt's just 2 dollars...and for what it gives you, it's more  than worth it.\n\n\n\n","May 2","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is both sad and hopeful at the same time. The focus isn't so much on what is happening, but how the protagonist experiences it. The lines between memory, dream, and reality get intentionally blurry.\n\nThe visuals and audio were simple, but appropriately expressive.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend the experience.
