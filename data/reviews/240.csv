"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/recommended/240/","bashfulbritishboy","Schmoes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/","121 products in account","Hello, cheeky chaps! For starters, what's the first thing that comes to mind when you saw this game? That's right, this isn't Call of Duty! This game is Country-Steak: Sauce and yes, it's a dank one, mate. Tesco's finest said so right on the package.\n\nFirst time playing, you're going to get mega wrecked and question yourself, ''How do I quickscope?''. If you're feeling down like the little, fedora wearing scrub that you are, why not get your noob butt popped with a solid, mint-condition bag of Doritos and to cool off your edgy skills with some Mountain Dew? Don't forget to even add in that inaudible dubstep that just adds passion and flare to your MLG gaming experience. If you repeat all of these actions, you just might have the chance to receive a granted entry into FaZe clan or a casting audition for the next special episode of EastEnders. Damn son, how does that sound and where'd you find this? You'll be the face of the MLG jubilee. Scrubs and hackers alike will all be wrecked by your hands, and may just in fact denote you as a cheeky Illuminati ninja, or possibly even a stupid autistic camper. As you can see, you're definitely around the corner from a notorious OpTiC application and a B&Q. By the way, check out my mate, Derrick on YouTube, if he reaches twenty subscribers, he'll do a dank giveaway. But if you don't, I'm afraid you will be eaten by the spooky scary skeletons and brought down to the depths of an Aldi's public urinal.\n\nThis game has many different servers of I don't bloody know, ducky darling. So, be sure to check them out, mate, or not, I don't give a damn. But please, do not ever lie about what happens to you when you play this game, if you're caught hacking, lose all your weed and fedora and get a VAC ban, it's your fault, you dirty, dragon eating, little s-p-a-s-t-i-c. On a related note, be careful of hackers, not only are they noobs, but they will definitely steal your fresh swag and obey cap in the process.\n\nMake sure that there are no snipers creeping behind you, so you can easily deck them in their heads, with your mighty yet cheeky, 360 no' handscope, pimp slap, as you're followed by the blinding lense flare. The mechanics, noscopes, hardscopes and of course, the precious quickscopes in this game are so amazing, that it'll leave you screaming, ''Mum, get the camera!'' with joy, enthusiasm and adrenaline, as you easily hook all your opponents in their puny little gabbers. You're now the star with the inevitable saying, ''Watch this, lads.'' followed by only the kills a CoD global elite sniper could pull off. with every euphoric game that passes by, be sure to treat yourself to a quick blaze of a dank blunt, right around 4:20pm, with a wee giggle, typing in the Doritos, crust-infested keyboard, ''gg lads no re.'' never leave it as, ''sample text.'' As it will only just make them more edgy and make them beg for your Steam login as well as full access to your memes. Poopy hackers, don't talk crap to me online, or I'll ban you, my dad works for Colgate toothpaste.\n\nBy the way, did I mention this game is great?\nThis was brought to you by Tesco's everyday value tomato soup, with special thanks to Kelloggs' cereal for the weed flakes to help me write this review. They're so great, mate, only 20p each. Haha, Asda once tried to bribe me to not write my reviews, what a packet of Hob-knobs. Subscribe to my flaming channel, old chap, for Pete's sake and remember to give this review a like so my Nan's dead soul can finally rest in pepperoni, after getting shanked outside Sainsbury's.\n\nOn a final ending note, got any crisps?","December 11, 2014","true","10.0"," 343 of 414 people (83%) found this review helpful 486 people found this review funny","83","343","414","486","2"

CS: Source (and it's predecessors) somehow found the balance between competitive and fun. The downright silly and super serious. Technical and instinctual.\nThe ability to allow your players to expand upon the original game almost limitlessly. Customization and depth is everywhere. From maps, models, skins, admin commands, sprays, communication, server types, etc. The commands, binds, scripts even the hacks can all be impressive.\n\nServers have been around for years and some since the beginning. Servers you can call your second home, a place where everyone knows your name. A great game to meet new people and find friends.\n\nYou'll actually improve you K/D ratio depending on how drunk you are (Drunken Boxing/Zui Quan martial art equivalent).\n\nHow developers should treat the players. Give them the game and development tools. Something to start with as they explore to their imaginations limits.\n\nThe type of game you wish others followed in it's example.\n\nOne of the last great games made by Valve before they began to go downhill... Unpopular Opinion I know, but the company has been all over the place developing and experimenting in things that aren't what made them so great in the first place. Dota 2's Arcade is an exception to this; a step in the right direction that reminded me of the old days.\n\nOverall this game is still alive and a home to many still to this day.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fenami/recommended/240/","fenami","iTsao","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fenami/","43 products in account","Ok, here are your options. You can buy this package and get three multiplayer games. Or you can buy the retail version of Half Life 2 and get Counter Strike:Source, Half Life 2 Deathmatch, and the story version of HL2. Basically, with this package versus HL2 retail, you will be trading the story version of HL2 for the multiplayer game Day of Defeat and whatever price difference there is.\n\nNow with that out of the way, I'd assume you are looking at this page because you are interested in Counter Strike: Source. Good choice. There is a reason CS:S is the number one online game in the world. The game is amazing......it's that simple.\n\nThe game is set up around the premise of Terrorists vs. Counter-Terrorists. When you first join a server you choose which side you want to be on, the main difference being the weapons you will have access to. During the game each team has a different goal. One some levels the Terrorists have to plant a bomb while the Counter-Terrorists try to stop them. On other levels the Counter-Terrorists try to rescue some hostages while the Terrorists try to stop them. During each round you get 1 life. That's it! This means if you die you have to sit around and wait until the round is over. It's not a big deal though, the levels are generally small and well designed, and rounds don't usually last very long. Some of the positives of this system are that it discourages "Rambo" type play where people will just run around with guns blazing, of course some people still do that, but most people are more concerned about being careful with their life.\n\nThe graphics in this game are amazing! All the particle, smoke and water effects are extremely well done. There is a reason the Source graphics engine is so popular and it shows in this game. If you don't have an up-to-date computer you may have to sacrifice some visuals for performance, but the Source engine scales quite well, so as long as you aren't years behind you should be able to find settings that work.\n\nA heads up to any parents up there, there is a good amount of blood in this game and obviously it is centered around shooting other people, so you may want to keep that in mind if you are purchasing for a kid.\n\nNow we move on to the actual gameplay. I already touched on the one life per round aspect of this game, but as a new player you should be prepared to die...... a lot! You will die over and over and you will never kill anyone. That is a fact, and if you are going to buy this game it would serve you well to just accept that right now. Having played First Person Shooters in the past will help a bit, but you will still be nothing but a bullet absorber when you first start out. The learning curve on this game is a bit steep, and there are many people out there who have been playing this game for years. They have the aiming system down to a science and know every level like the back of their hand. There is also a little weapon called the AWP, which is a sniper rifle you will get to know very well. Mainly by the amount of times you are killed by it. This is a one shot one kill weapon and there are some players out there who simply don't miss with it. Suffice to say it can be quit frustrating when you are constantly killed from 200 yards while you barely get a chance to even see who shot you.\n\nThe point of all this is that it will require a bit of patience to learn this game and get to a skill level where you can be competitive. There is a neat little option where you can start your own server and fill it with "bots", which are computer controlled characters, and use this as practice. You can even set the difficulty level of the bots. While no AI can compete with human intelligence this is a good way to get better at the game and learn the levels if you are getting frustrated on real servers.\n\nOverall, it's a great game that is being updated constantly with new levels and features. If you can get past the learning curve you will be rewarded with a satisfying online shooter that you will be playing for years to come. If you are easily frustrated and do not want to put in the time it takes to get good at this game you may want to pass on this and try something else.","February 26, 2015","true","111.5"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","19","19","5","0"

They are both amazing games that allows the players to continue changing their experiences. Custom maps, skins, mods, i had so much fun playing this game... zombie,surf, jail, fy maps, the classics, i have tons of memories in this game. Global Offensive will never be better than this, trust me. The gameplay here is much more "Counter Strike" than GO. The graphics are obvsiouly oudated, but they are still good using the Source engine. If you read my GO review, you will see why i dont like Global Offensive : Valve. Yep, in my opinion Valve is ruining this franchise with the whole "pay the game then pay more for skins" to fully "enjoy" the experience. Thats why 1.6 and Source were more enjoyable than GO, becouse you buy the game and you dont have to pay more. If you want skins, download for free it or just build one yourself with the right tools. Source praises criativity, while GO praises CASH. While the "Competitive" mode introduced in GO make people think that the game is more serious now, it really isnt. There were professional championships in Source and 1.6 also.\nTherefore, Counter Strike became a classic that continues to shine everyday and will keep shining forever ;)","July 7, 2015","true","455.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051461196/recommended/240/","76561198051461196","Classic","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051461196/","42 products in account","What is Counter Strike: Source?\nIt is a multiplayer first-person shooter which is a remake of the original Counter Strike that focuses on the teams of Counter-Terrorists against Terrorists, this game includes plenty of maps including some well known maps such as de_dust2 with the gamemode of Bomb defusal and cs_office having the gamemode of Hostage rescue.This game involves quite a bit of skill unlike other first-person shooters out there which can be hard to get used to.\n\nHow it Works\nThis game takes quite a bit of skill as said previously, it requires knowledge and understanding of the game. This can mean learning the economics of the game, from nade usage to shooting and compnesating spray control. As you progress you will start to learn these things. Learning is what makes this game longer-lasting and more enjoyable than other first-person shooters.\n\nPopular Gamemodes\nBomb Defusal\nThis is a gamemode with the main objective where the Counter-Terrorists try to prevent the Terrorists from planting at either Bomb sites A or B. There are 2 ways that will give you victory, as Counter-Terrorists you can eliminate the enemy team or defuse the bomb before it explodes. When playing as Terrorist you can win doing the same thing as the Counter-Terrorists which is eliminating the enemy team or planting the bomb and letting it explode.\n\nHostage Rescue\nA gamemode which has hostages that are placed where the Terrorist spawn, same concept with the wiping out enemy team but instead of the Terrorists objective to plant the bomb, it is the Counter-Terrorist to rescue the hostages and take them back to where the Counter-Terrorists spawn.\n\nCustom Gamemodes\nLastly in Counter Strike: Source you will be seeing a lot of custom maps and servers which make up majority of the servers nowadays. These gamemodes go from minigames to bhop and surf with plenty of other custom gamemodes to chose from. Custom gamemodes are especially fun to play when you are bored or just looking for something to play with your mates.\n\n\nConclusion\nWell worth buying it if it goes on sale a little bit cheaper as it is a little old and not worth the $20 at the moment. Worth all the 200+ hours on this game however there aren't as much servers as they use to be because it is getting old and there are mods that are available which are a load of fun to play such as Jailbreak and Zombies. Hands down the best game for its time and maybe even today (at least for me). I do recommend this game to those who are thinking of purchasing it although you better purchase it soon as servers are getting wiped. Although if you are still wanting the Counter Strike Experience you can switch over to CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Offensive). Its a good alternative but I still prefer Counter Strike: Source over it\n\n9.5/10","March 18, 2014","true","259.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","1"

The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective: defusing the bomb, rescuing all hostages, or killing the entire opposing team. The ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than the opposing team. This game used to be a mod back in 90s is than CS 1.6 come out and now they remake the game with Source engine and thats how this game born.\n\nIs not what you think like other game u hold down the trigger and aim at player easily get lots kill you need know how the gun work how to handle different kind of gun cos they all have different recoil damage and range. while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the trigger down to continuously shoot produces severe recoil. The severity of damage induced by weaponry is dependent upon the specific locations of hits, with hits to the head being most lethal and shots which make contact elsewhere causing lesser loss of health.\n\nNow 2014 i dont play this game that much anymore,but sometime is nice when i get on the game with AK grad few kill have some fun and trust i have alot memory in this game :)\n\n","July 6, 2014","true","3.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Want to have custom sound effects that make the players make goofy death noises? You can. Sprites? Yep. Screen Overlays/Hud Messages and Elements? Yep. None of this can be done with CSGO without either being half-broken, or crashing the game.\n\nIf you want variety and a unique gameplay experience from server to server, get CSS.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justinheeber/recommended/240/","justinheeber","Thicc Marahuans","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justinheeber/","95 products in account","Hitman Squads, is a crime business game with RPG elements, developed by Infinity Ward and published by EA. It took over 5 years to make, so you know it's good. You play as your custom hitman in a hitman squad. By the way, the game rips of Saints Row: The Menace of Shrek with it's crazy character customization. Anyway, you and your hitman squad to various crimes while trying not to be killed by the police with Sam Fisher nightvision goggles. You'll be doing things like planting bombs in a nuclear plant, holding hostages in an office while holding off the police, and doing a neighborhood heist. The game has an economy system that rips off Payday 2 that lets you buy weapons before going in. For example, you start out with a pistol. By completing missions, you get money. You can spend that money on new weapons and equip- WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS. Just pay $35 in real life and get the raygun already.\n\nThe game isn't without it's flaws though. Everytime I beat the mission, I get sent back from the start and I have to do it 12 times in order to progress. Other than that though, the campaign is one of the best I've played. The game is also very unrealistic. The game doesn't let you aim down sights, and when you press Shift to sprint, you WALK instead? What were they thinking? The multiplayer is one of the worst I have ever seen. It's basically the same thing as the single-player, but you get to play as the cops, and you have to buy guns during matches. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING. Why would you play as the cops? That's stupid. Also, the MP9 Silenced SMG is overpowered. YOU CAN STAY OFF THE MINI-MAP. WHAT?\n\nEven with all of it's flaws, it's still one of the best games I've ever played, if not the best. This game gets a 9001/10, get Call of Duty Ghosts 43 instead.","February 25, 2014","true","26.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","2"

This means all new textures and major aesthetic changes with more complex buildings and scenery. In addition, the levels are scattered with objects that react realistically with the Source engine's physics engine. A rather good game. Graphics and models are satisfactory and there aren't a lot of hackers in this game (as far as I know, but I could be wrong). This game really boosts teamwork abilities in people unlike other games.

Enjoyable regardless of how much time a day you have to play it. Graphics are very flexible (they can go from looking very realistic to looking like Quake), and overall the game is simply entertaining, it gives you good times. The only things that really annoy me are the default animations for each weapon, which look pretty...rough, as if they were taken straight from 1.6 without any editing (e.g smoothing the animations).\n\nHowever the game does make up for it with the fact that it's very easy to mod. Once you put in it custom skins or maps of your liking, you're golden! It can give you an even better experience. CS:S is not just a realistic FPS; it can be everything, and you are the one who decides what the game should become with all the kind of mods that exist for it. For example, I'm even using a mod that turns all of the grenades into Rubik's cubes!\n\nI recommend it.","January 8, 2015","true","475.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","7","9","3","0"

Visuals are not the strong point of CSS - it is ok though. Sound is good, guns sound great. Voice commands are great and very helpful (bots react to them). Not too many guns, but that is not the problem. Different maps offer different gameplay - you will definitely find at least some of these very pleasing. Gamemodes - always Ts against CTs - defuse or hostage rescue - both fun and tense.\n\nUser created content - community has created bazillions of various maps - there is an insane number of them.

The gunplay is also different, but balanced: no gun is ever the same (obviously), and the in-game money you earn from kills and completing objectives  will make you decide between an expensive AWP and a helpful Kevlar vest.\nThat, and the fact, that this game's mod-friendly increases the replay value considerably, makes you wanting for more Counter-Strike, even after a long hiatus.","September 8, 2013","true","140.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This gets rid of most of the errors in Garry's Mod for one and is also a really fun game! However it needs a sort of Team Deathmatch mode like in Call Of Duty (Even though I hate that game) because having to wait for the round to end just to respawn is pathetic. However there is one mode called Gun Game which is Instant Respawn and you just go round shooting people and the more kills you get the better gun you get.

And you can’t complain too much about that.It's fast-paced and a little goofy, but it's also very tactical and teamwork based. The learning curve is very steep (the maps are easy to learn, but the shooting system is hard to perfect). The Source engine gives the game a solid feel. And if playing the standard way is not your things, there is a wide variety of custom maps and game types (minigames, zombie mod, jail break, hide n seek, surfing, etc...). Also if you think Call of Duty is competitive don't even bother buying this game. This is for the die hard FPS fans.It will take a long time to hone your skills.

Lots of different server types, mods, gun games all sorts. Very good fun.\n\nRecently came back to the game after trying the new CS:GO, I can pretty much say this is the way better game out of the two and is still very well populated with many players playing all hours of the day.\n\nStill seem to be a lot of top players playing on the servers, good people with 3000+ hours in game which I'm very glad to see.\n\nand people are still happy to chat and be social during rounds in games as well, not many people really complaining or whining about anything.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Idunnoburgers/recommended/240/","Idunnoburgers","G-B312","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Idunnoburgers/","61 products in account","Whoo, CSS, my favorite of the series.\nI'll have to say, its gunplay is probably the best out of them. I know, I know, to some, it might feel like its too easy. But no, I think you still have to worry about recoil and such. Plus its just Counter-Strike with the Source engine, the only difference is that some maps from 1.6 didn't make it in and there are some new maps (that also happen to have not been carried over to GO.)\nBoth the new ones and the old ones have great map design, however. Bot AI is alright. They're still kinda stupid even in Hard but I can't complain too much since I'm pretty sure the AI was carried over from CZ (Condition Zero). What makes them harder is their boosted reaction times, weapon preferences, etc.\nSpeaking of bots, if you want to play with human players, there's no such thing as matchmaking or whatever, just a server browser which makes things...quite hard. Why? Oh, I dunno, could be UT2k4 sounds that are so repetitive that could stop you from playing on that server. Or maybe the fact that a server has 16k dollars whenever anyone spawns regardless of how many wins and losses. Basically, there is no tag for avoiding "community" servers. Which is exactly why I don't play this game online much. Also because literally every brazilian player is some kind of insane pro that once he snags an M4 or AK you're pretty much screwed.\nSound design...eh...I mean, most of it was carried over from 1.6 and for its time, 1.6's sound design was actually pretty good. In 2004?...Not so much. I mean, it's still well-designed for detecting enemies and the like, but I mean the quality of the sounds. It all feels like someone just edited stock sounds to make it playable. I'm probably wrong on that matter, maybe, but looking back, it feels a lot that way.\nThe design for the weapons, the least important thing ever, since you can also just download a skin that at least makes it  look better...For a Source remake, I'm actually impressed they managed to make the guns look like their real life selves in 2004! But if you're unhappy you can just do what I said above. Reloading animations are so wrong, though. Like pulling the bolt catch on the M4. That's just silly. Then again the animation was from the original CS and back then Valve didn't actually own the franchise. Ah, well. Skins also fix that.\nHitboxes are actually spot-on, unlike GO. You have an AK and your crosshair's on someone's head. What happens? Exactly.\nThat's why I love this game so much. I never complained about not having dealt enough damage, because I always did deal damage.\nGameplay is balanced since its all carried over from 1.6.\nI won't cover the radio chatter since that's more for practical reasons rather than flavor. If you're wondering why the voice acting on them's so lame, it's exactly because it's one of the higher staff from the original CS dev team doing the acting.\nI'm also not going to criticize weapons I dislike despite them having a place in the game like everyone else. I hate the P90 and how overused it is, but if its in the game, its in the game. All of the weapons have their strengths and weaknesses, but the assault rifles by far have it all perfect, since, they don't have weaknesses and they're capable of doing what other weapons specialize in, best.\nSpeaking of assault rifles, the 3-round burst is overpowered but I love it because of just that. It has pinpoint accuracy when firing, unlike 1.6 or literally every CS title as of yet, and it makes the AK seem like a donkey to use when you have the FAMAS' burst on someone's head. Literally 2 shots on one's head to get a headshot if they're wearing a helmet. You don't have to worry about the FAMAS missing one of those shots. The glock gets the same burst but it's not as effective, granted, as it is a starting pistol and doesn't have much in the way of armor penetration.\nMaybe for balance it breaks it a little what with the CTs having a much better cheap AR in comparison to the T's Galil. Oh well! People seem to enjoy buying deagles instead...I don't blame them.\nI think that's it. I hope I covered everything someone would need before purchasing this game. In my opinion, it is the best CS title as of yet. The only problem I have, personally, is the fact it lacks a filter for, well...filtering OUT the community servers. But if that's not a problem to you, you should totally get this one. If it is, well...you're probably better off getting GO. 1.6 is essentially the same as Source though, uses a server browser, too. Doesn't even have Source's Tags feature, either.\nHave fun playing it if ya do get it! :D","April 19","true","135.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As they are about to kiss each other goodnight at the front door, when the guy starts feeling a little horny.\n\nWith an air of confidence, he leans with his hand against the wall and smiling, he says to her, "Honey, would you give me a bj??\n\n"Horrified, she replies, "Are you mad? My parents will see us!",\n"Oh come on! Who's gonna see us at this hour?" he asks grinning at her.\n"No, please. Can you imagine if we get caught?"\n"Oh come on! there's nobody around, they're all sleeping!"\n"No way. It's just too risky!"\n"Oh please, please, I love you so much?!?"\n"No, no, and no. I love you too, but I just can't!"\n"Oh yes you can. Please?"\n"No, no. I just can't" "I'm begging you??..."\n\nOut of the blue, the light on the stairs goes on, and the girl's sister shows up in her pyjamas, hair dishevelled, and in a sleepy voice she says,\n\n"Dad says to go ahead and give him a bj, or I can do it. Or if need be, mom will do it, or even dad.\nBut for God's sake tell him to take his ♥♥♥♥ing hand off the intercom!"","May 7, 2015","true","31.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","4","5","7","1"

Climbing, Bhop, football, scout, multigames, Zombiez...\n\nMy favorite is the last one, even if surviving isnt that easy, the big danger won't come as you might think from the ennemy , ie: zombiez, but from noob CTs especially the edgers (the worst thing is that they never learn from their mistakes o.O)... so beware, you've been warned !!!

It is heavily moddable, has an extensive community, and has quick gameplay with sharp controls and low system requirements. Some of the best things about Counter Strike lie in it's community, and the content they make. Zombie Escape, for example, is the gamemode I play most on, with close-knit groups of players and a fairly large variety of maps to play on.\nI would dare argue that ALL Counter Strike games are worth buying for these very reasons, especially Counter Strike: Source.","December 1, 2013","true","677.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was the first one I ever played, the campaign remains in my mind today even though I no longer have it (I think?). When I saw that Source was available with Garry's Mod for all but a shilling, I had to grab it and give it a test run. Safe to say, I haven't been disappointed.\n\nWith a complete graphical overhaul, I was paying close attention to the detail of the weapons and smaller geometries around the world in addition to the character texturing/meshes. Valve pulled it off, and they did it well. I played this game for hours with a friend, jumping from server to server experiencing what I had never done before. Playing online at such a young age during Condition Zero was just something I never did. In my own personal opinion, Source is better than even the more modern day Call of Duty's, and it is from the same category (First-Person Shooter). I even think the sounds got some looking after as they seem to be much clearer then they did back in 2004. However, all good things must come to an end as I stopped my CS experience here: Global Offensive just does not appeal to me, at all. Onto the pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n» Graphical overhaul has mentioned, a real step-up from Condition Zero.\n» Sound also seems to be a big factor. I noticed that even the running sounds were revamped for the release.\n» Animations were reworked as far as I can tell. One thing that stood out to me was the idle animation for the knife.\n» Many online gamemods, great fun to play!\n» Although this is a Valve product, it has great integration with Garry's Mod which is nice to see.\n\nCons:\n» Considering this game is ten years old (I can't believe it!) it's absolutely magnificent. I just wish there had been a campaign like CZ.\n\nMy rating for CSS is 8/10. I took into account the length the game has been released and some of the technical factors in regards to the game engine and blockages that may have come up. The only thing that stopped it reaching a nine was the no campaign. I wish they had that!","June 27, 2014","true","21.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Valve pulled it off, and they did it well. I played this game for hours with a friend, jumping from server to server experiencing what I had never done before. Playing online at such a young age during Condition Zero was just something I never did. In my own personal opinion, Source is better than even the more modern day Call of Duty's, and it is from the same category (First-Person Shooter). I even think the sounds got some looking after as they seem to be much clearer then they did back in 2004. However, all good things must come to an end as I stopped my CS experience here: Global Offensive just does not appeal to me, at all. Onto the pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n» Graphical overhaul has mentioned, a real step-up from Condition Zero.\n» Sound also seems to be a big factor. I noticed that even the running sounds were revamped for the release.\n» Animations were reworked as far as I can tell. One thing that stood out to me was the idle animation for the knife.\n» Many online gamemods, great fun to play!\n» Although this is a Valve product, it has great integration with Garry's Mod which is nice to see.\n\nCons:\n» Considering this game is ten years old (I can't believe it!) it's absolutely magnificent. I just wish there had been a campaign like CZ.\n\nMy rating for CSS is 8/10. I took into account the length the game has been released and some of the technical factors in regards to the game engine and blockages that may have come up. The only thing that stopped it reaching a nine was the no campaign. I wish they had that!","June 27, 2014","true","21.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But if you don't mind that, and if you don't mind modding, get Counter-Strike Source. Why? It is much better in terms of modding than CS:GO, the majority of servers will support mods so don't worry about that. You can replace all of those crappy default weapon models with HD models far better than CS:GO's with fancy animations.

It is truly the hypest of all PC games. Your enjoyment of shooters or not is irrelevant! Kneel before the master PC game of the superior master console race! But seriously its an amazing game, its not simply TDM or hostage rescue. The countless user generated content keeps the game timeless, even with the release of global offensive I still find my self coming back to this game time and time again. Those who have not played this game at all, should not count them self's as a 'True' PC gamer. I know that's quite a bold statement to make but I'm making it. Im not saying you have to be a source fan girl like me, but you should give it a shot. The graphics are as extreme or as simple as you want it, On my X51 (with a few modifications) I can get about 300FPS in game on maxed settings. While the last Update I recall did put an end to extreme bunny hopping, changes are few and far between for this game, and why shouldn't they be? You wouldn't go putting neon lights on the Mona Lisa would you? The community again is like the graphics... They can be as extreme and vulgar as you want, or a sweet and innocent. Anyway that's enough of me fan girl'ing over my wifu game. I hope this encourages a certain sexy voice actor/ musician to give this game a try, heck ill even buy it for you.

Maps: planting bombs, rescuing hostages, running from zombies, knife only, scoutknivez, awp only, Warcraft 3 RPG mod, Gungame mod, etc. You have the ability to make your own maps and mods as well. Looking for servers is easy, and simple unlike some games that dont even show you ping! (Left 4 Dead cough). Rounds are usually pretty quick and you can play as long as little as you want. Used to play this game a lot back in the day, and have recently been getting into it a lot.

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was the first one I ever played, the campaign remains in my mind today even though I no longer have it (I think?). When I saw that Source was available with Garry's Mod for all but a shilling, I had to grab it and give it a test run. Safe to say, I haven't been disappointed.\n\nWith a complete graphical overhaul, I was paying close attention to the detail of the weapons and smaller geometries around the world in addition to the character texturing/meshes. Valve pulled it off, and they did it well. I played this game for hours with a friend, jumping from server to server experiencing what I had never done before. Playing online at such a young age during Condition Zero was just something I never did. In my own personal opinion, Source is better than even the more modern day Call of Duty's, and it is from the same category (First-Person Shooter). I even think the sounds got some looking after as they seem to be much clearer then they did back in 2004. However, all good things must come to an end as I stopped my CS experience here: Global Offensive just does not appeal to me, at all. Onto the pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n» Graphical overhaul has mentioned, a real step-up from Condition Zero.\n» Sound also seems to be a big factor. I noticed that even the running sounds were revamped for the release.\n» Animations were reworked as far as I can tell. One thing that stood out to me was the idle animation for the knife.\n» Many online gamemods, great fun to play!\n» Although this is a Valve product, it has great integration with Garry's Mod which is nice to see.\n\nCons:\n» Considering this game is ten years old (I can't believe it!) it's absolutely magnificent. I just wish there had been a campaign like CZ.\n\nMy rating for CSS is 8/10. I took into account the length the game has been released and some of the technical factors in regards to the game engine and blockages that may have come up. The only thing that stopped it reaching a nine was the no campaign. I wish they had that!","June 27, 2014","true","21.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
