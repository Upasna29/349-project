If you like open-world games with a sense of humor, and you want to plow through thousands of enemies using all sorts of crazy improvised weapons, this is the game for you. This is one of the last games by Keiji Inafune before he left Capcom.\n\nHowever, it requires you to create and sign in with a Games for Windows Live account. In order to save your game, you need to be signed in and connected at all times. This is a real problem. I can no longer get this game to even run, because the Games for Windows Live installer crashes on my Windows 8.1 system. The only way around this would be to either download a pirated copy that removes Games for Windows Live or play it on a console. Either way, I wouldn't be able to play the game with my friends, which is the best part of the game.\n\nWorse yet, Microsoft is shutting down its Games for Windows Live service, making this game essentially useless. The good news is, Capcom has announced that they will be patching it to remove Games for Windows Live. As I write this review, Capcom has yet to do so. I can only hope they stay true to their word. Once again, this is one of the best games ever.","May 10, 2014","true","145.1"," 93 of 107 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","93","107","0","6"

Servicable voice acting, decent plot and a good protagonist make uncovering the next story event something to look forward to.\n+ Lively, well developed characters.\n+ Myriad of fun and effective weapons. Combine two weapons into one of extreme power. Combo weapons are creative and worth the hassle.\n+ Leveling up your character gives rewarding incentive to do some sandbox and replays.\n+ Fantastically recorded and generated sound assets.\n+ Fortune City is a colorful, enjoyable map with plenty of fun and surprises.\n+ Zombies are dismembered in satisfying, dynamic ways.\n+ Visuals are obviously dated but serviceable.\n+ Decent amount of PC options. Controls are relatively problem free. Not a Mad Max quality port, but certainly a giant leap from something Arkham Knight quality.\n+ Co-op can ease up more difficult missions and add substantial enjoyment to the slaughter.\n+ Vehicles are a great transportation/murder tool, even if the controls can be a bit over/under compensating.\n\n- The timer is the biggest controversy of this game. I personally hate being paced, stressed, and rushed. The only reason I reccomend this game is because you can disable/slow the timer with mods and trainers. The timer adds a decent challenge to the game but leaves little time for fun screwing around or side missions.\n- Competetive online is dead, but it was never really "all that" in the first place. Fairly generic "American Gladiator"-esque challenges that involve zombie death.\n- Side missions; particularly the survivor escorts, are repetetive and pretty boring. Survivors can slow you down and become a time wasting liability.\n- Although the "psychopath" boss fights are memorable and contain great characters, they are rather annoying and dependant on your level rather than your skill and adaptability. They often boil down to the same "dodge this then hit me" formula.\n- Some combat mechanics wear thin quick and become a chore. Shaking your mouse in a QTE to shed a grappling zombie (which happens OFTEN), getting knocked flat on your ♥♥♥ and stunned by almost all human attacks, stopping to cough sporatically when the later introduced enemy attacks you.\n- Normal, non-combo weapons feel a bit underpowered for the most part. Firearms have their damage heavily reduced against human enemies for no explained reason. Uncombined melee and throwable weapons break very quickly and yield very little experience.\n\nOverall, Chuck Greene's a pretty cool guy who makes pretty cool weapons and kills zombies in pretty cool ways in a pretty cool set-piece. The only overbearing cons are the timer which can be circumvented via mods and the lousy side-missions which are totally optional. Picked up for about $7 which justifies almost thirty hours of play.","November 6, 2015","true","27.9"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","45","49","2","3"

Story is fairly decent, but it's not the game's strongest aspect. There is multiple endings, but ending A and S are the only ones worth getting.\n\nDescribing the type of game dead rising is, is rather tricky since it's in a league of it's, however what I can call it is that it's a beat em up hack n slash third person shooting open world rpg, or you can just call it an action rpg.\n\nCombat is slow and kind of annoying, but somehow in the end it's so fun slicing and bashing zombies. You can use anything as a weapon from knifes,guns (which are quite fun to use), brooms, to wheelchairs even. However each item breaks, which makes the game kind of refreshing.\n\nOne of the elements of the game that makes it so much fun is the combo cards, which allow you to take 2 items you find. You need to go to a maintenance room for it.\n\nThere is an rpg element in the sense that you will level up with PP. How do you get PP? Kill Kill and Kill, and also completing side missions which involves Rescuing survivors(which is kind of annoying, but tolerable if you find the leadership magazine) and fighting psychopaths(Optional boss battles that are generally enjoyable to fight).\n\nthe game also has a Timer which will turn a lot of people off....on the first playthrough, on the 2nd since you are at a higher level it's no big deal.\n\nDead rising 2 may not be technically impressive, but the game is never afraid to show something visually appealing and the animations are fairly good.\n\nSound is good, the music is ranges from lounge music, rock, to atmospheric music which fits well with the goofy nature of the game.\n\nDead rising 2 may not appeal to everyone, but what it does it's does it quite well.\n\n7/10","July 8, 2014","true","50.3"," 59 of 72 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","59","72","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/recommended/45740/","midnightwolfie","MidnightWolfie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/","597 products in account","A bit about the game and developers.\nDead Rising 2 is a sequel to a zombie slaying game - Dead Rising. Dead Rising 2 is set a bit after Dead Rising, but has nothing to do with the original game. Dead Rising 2 has been developed by Blue Castle Games, and published by Capcom! It's funny how Capcom has so many well known zombie games...\n\nAbout Gameplay.\nDead Rising 2 is an open world zombie survival game. In Dead Rising 2 you have couple of missions (one main mission and a lot of side missions) which you do not need to follow at all! You see, Dead Rising 2 is a game in which you can do almost anything. Grab a motorbike, put a chainsaw on it and run over zombies. Or grab a motorbike, put machine gun on it and kill more zombies! Or just run around with nothing but a blade in your hands, chopping down everything in your path. The ways you can kill this zombies are almost limitless!\n\nWhat makes this game far better than the first one is co-op option! You can call a friend to play this game with you and destroy the zombies with you! It's very fun indeed! Imagine two motorbikes with chainsaws, just driving down the street, ending every single zombie's life that is currently present.  This game also gives you and ability to craft a weapon out of two other weapons. For example, with a broom and a machete you make something like a spear. With knife and boxing gloves you make razor claws. With nails and a baseball bat... Very deadly baseball bat! You get the point - it's extremely fun!\n\nSo, as I said, you can chose to do the mission or you could just chose to ignore it and have loads of fun in the game. The game has six different endings, which all happen with a reason. For example, if you do whole main mission and then chose option A on some point (i don't plan to give out any spoilers!) You'll get first and best ending. If you do main mission and chose option B, you'll get almost same thing as A case. Everything else is more or less failure.\n\nThe game also futures a four person co-op in which all you can do is drive around a small area on a motorcycle and kill tones and tones and tones of zombies. I can't tell you much about that because I never managed to get into a game. There are just not enough players that play it..\n\nGraphic and Audio\nGraphically speaking the game looks very very sweet. There's just enough blood, the zombies are quite detailed and everything seems in place. They could have added more different looking zombies though. Audio is very awesome and never gets too boring to listen to! It keeps changing as you enter stores, menu and so on and on. Only positive thoughts about Audio of this game!\n\nPros, cons and final grade.\nPros:\n- Great co op fun.\n- A lot of different clothing and weapons.\n- Audio never gets boring.\n- A lot of vehicles.\n- You can keep on playing even if you decide not to do missions.\n\nCons:\n- Main mission forces you to wait a long time before continuing the story..\n- Only two people co op.\n- No players so the 4 person co-op is impossible without friends.\n- The game uses Games for Windows Live so it might become unplayable next year since GFWL is going down..\n\nOverall grade: 8.5 / 10\n\nExtra info: This is an amazing zombie killing game to pass the time. I really enjoyed playing it with a friend of mine, Mr.Trolla. Thank you for playing the game with me!\n\nThank you for reading my reviews! Don't forget that I'm usually posting new reviews on my blog weekly and you can check them out here:[/b] http://midnightwolfie.blogspot.com\nThank you![/b]","November 27, 2013","true","9.9"," 41 of 53 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","41","53","0","3"

Pictures/camera have been replaced with custom weapons (much more fun),the AI has been drastically improved, the text size has been enlarged (finally),and no more annoying Otis.\n\nEssentially,however,this game is a love/hate kind of deal. If you didn't like DR1, chances are,you're not going to like DR2.It follows the same overall system.You start out incredibly weak,you level up,psychopaths can be -extremely- hard,and dying is generally unforgiving (although this time around,having 3 save files really does help quite a bit).\n\nOverall: If this doesn't sound like your thing, you'd best avoid the game.

After searching through the internet for various fixes that did not help, I uninstalled the Games for Windows it tried to install.  I then installed it directly from the windows website.  It again did not work.  I uninstalled again and installed from the xbox website.  It now loaded up but gave me an error when trying to sign in with my windows live information.  The error is vague and I had to search it as well.  Apparently you have to manually login through the xbox website or through an xbox to accept the terms and conditions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lavarat/recommended/45740/","lavarat","A Large Wallaby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lavarat/","100 products in account","There is frustration around every corner of this game.\nTo start off, you are not welcome to play this game at your own rate. It juxtaposes a Majora's Mask-Like mechanic around a leveling system. You level up and unlock recipies and special combat moves (most of which you can more easily unlock by inviting someone who has already beaten the game to your session) But you are also required to do the main missions in the time it gives you for each of them (Which ranges between more than enough time, to just enough time, to ridiculously slim time, to a lot of time, but you have to wait until the nick of time to actually show up, and that pisses me off the most) When you die or get a Game Over, you are given the option to either return to your last save, or the less popular option to keep all levels and experience in hand, but start the story over from the beginning. You have no other option, and your last save may as well be miles behind your grinding, and this is a VERY grindy game.\nNext, the fairness aspect is divided between the game and the missions. They worked hard to make the zombie combat realistic and fair, however the "psychopath" bosses deal and take unreasonable amounts of damage, and you have no way of avoiding them when they attack. On top of that, bosses stick around, so when you discover them (which, at many times can be completely by accident) You have to either fight them with your current equipment and health, or wait them out until the mission requiring you to off them eventually expires. Whenever you enter the area, they will immediately hunt you down until you either beat them or leave. This flip-flop of realism completely ruins the flow of the game, if the story-save mechanic didn't do that already, as you switch between a game where proper headshots or hard hits kill zombies and Tekken with chainsaws.\nAnd I neglected to mention that this game never autosaves. You can only save it on the spot after an important mission, which at most times is near somewhere that you can save. The save mechanic revolves around visiting a restroom (this game includes a lot of sex and toilet humor, but unlike games like GTA or Borderlands, they aren't nearly as endearing, as the story goes between a drama and a horror-psycho approach), which requires precise planning allthewhile battling the clock, which is a war you will ultimately lose, as it is borderline impossible to achieve every side mission in the game with the unforgiving times they permit you.\nAnd finally, it is very buggy, you sometimes lose things you have already unlocked by going back, and there are plenty of other bugs to spare, which stick out like a sore thumb as the game is generally attractive and persistent at most times; and they aren't funny when they occur, they are just annoying, as this isn't a true sandbox game, it's a story game with a limit where every damn second counts. (Although, the levels always reset and anything you've left behind gets wiped)\nI am very dissapointed in this game, especially since I bought the complete pack. Besides the graphics and animation, it's really lazy with voice acting limited to story scenes and unmanageable press-a-to-continue interactions that are all labeled "interact" in-game. It's still a fun play, though repetitive, unlocking new weapons and getting through those tight zombie fending scenes and kicking ♥♥♥ with an overpowered combo weapon is sure a hoot; but the mechanics that top it off totally limiting what would be a fun experience into an uninteresting story with a generic traitor plot that you are forced to put before all else to avoid having to reset in said story.\nUnless you don't mind the restrictions to freedom and want to play an otherwise okay zombie game, I would NOT reccomend purchasing this game.","June 22, 2014","false","12.4"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","22","36","0","0"

The game is very effective in creating tension, and you will often feel conflicted by the decisions you make as you will not be able to do everything DR 2 has to offer on the first playthrough.\n\nThe game play is straightforward enough, you guide chuck Greene (motorcyclist extraordinaire) through a collection of zombie infested zones- each broken up by a 15 second load time, and along the way you will encounter bosses, looters, and survivors. Much of this content is optional, but you'll want to complete some of the side quests as they help Chuck level up, learn new moves, and become faster and stronger.\n\nThe story of Dead Rising 2 is good, if a little uninspired. You begin  at the end of a "Terror is Reality" motorcycle show to find that fortune city is overrun by hordes of the undead. It's up to you to get chuck and his zombie infected daughter to a safe house that becomes home to you and your fellow survivors. The rest of the game's story feels more like a patchwork of cutscenes that feel like they sort of blend together, but do not feel directly linked to your actions or playstyle. Because you will only play about a third of the game'a content on a single playthrough, and because so much of that content is optional the story in Dead Rising 2 feels very loose and definitely takes a backseat to the game's truly excellent action.\n\nOn my first play Dead Rising 2 took me about 15 hours to complete. And with multiple playthroughs available there is easily plenty of zombie killing value here for your dollar. This is also a well optimized port that works well on lower end graphics cards. I had no trouble playing the game on a radeon R7 240. So if you are looking for a violent, zombie-infested romp look no further- Dead Rising 2 is here on pc and it's great!","May 14","true","19.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frawt/recommended/45740/","Frawt","Peter Pan(cake)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frawt/","304 products in account","Dead Rising 2 is an interesting game. The premise, while differing from the first one, presents the exact same kind of gameplay structure. You're thrust into a big locale filled with zombies from one end to the other, and your playground is stacked to the brim with items that you can pick up and either use as weapons or consume for health.\n\nOne big problem the game has that very ironically cripples the game's fun factor is the constantly running time, with relatively strict time limits placed on every mission in the game. From what I could glean, there is no way to turn this off. Even if they don't want to abandon the intentional rushed feeling of being stuck in a city filled with zombies, the time limit could make some concessions, considering it keeps running during almost all missions, even after you've initiated them, which might leave you to randomly fail a mission that, for example, involves carrying a wounded woman back to the safe house, a trial she survives with no problems if you don't waste time running to her rescue at the beginning of the mission, but for some reason "the truth is lost forever" when you take time to make a few Painkillers and create some combo weapons beforehand and then go take her, and the timer runs out mid-mission.\n\nAnother gripe is the game's limited save system. This was a huge criticism levied at the first game, and maybe the decrying of the first game was pointless, because the Dead Rising series seems poised to retain its rushed, dangerous and desolate feel of tight time limits and very sparse save points, that lead you to being unable to save a huge majority of the survivors, and make you reload earlier saves often to save time while doing the main missions.\n\nOverall, though, the game is a delight. Chuck Greene starts out as a boring alternative to Frank West, but quickly becomes endearing, especially with the addition of a good co-cast, and a sporadic, but nonetheless touching, relationship between Chuck and his daughter, who periodically needs Zombrex, medicine that keeps her from turning into a zombie, due to a zombie bite gained prior to the game's events.\n\nThe combo weapons are fun, and once you get the hang of the game and start instinctually knowing where maintenance rooms are and memorizing the combinations, you'll feel naked using regular weapons (except for the firearms, and a few others, like the broadsword, which would be ridiculously fun if only it lasted for longer), which is a good sign in my opinion, because the joy of creating a cool combo weapon is satisfying to no end, especially with the discovery of some of the better ones.\n\nThe psychopaths are tons of fun to fight (once you gain a few levels, 'cause in the beginning they're impossible) and have varied fighting tactics which, coupled with the different environments and weapons you have and their relatively high difficulty, provide variety in tactics that you have no choice but to experiment with to prevail.\n\nThe storyline throws a few curveballs at you and doesn't throw too much monotony at you, which is more the domain of the tedious survivor rescues. Even though not too emotionally gripping for most of it, there are a few moments in the plot that can really get to you, especially if with the hardships you have to go through with so many gameplay limitations, you feel magnified emotional connections to some of the characters that you co-operate with, look after and occasionally save.\n\nAll in all, there's not much to say. Chuck controls very well, and there's a certain "meatiness" to his turning and his hits (with the feeling of smashing through a crowd of zombies with a sledgehammer being my favourite), and with the exception of the annoying time limitations which sometimes don't even make logical sense and the still-annoyingly sparse save points, the game is a fun romp that makes you feel both powerful, and hopelessly weak, that controls with little fault, and oozes personality through the graphical presentation and the colourful characters.","August 28, 2013","true","20.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Yes it is a discontinued system, but when installed properly there's no problems playing the game. Since saying that isn't very helpful let me break it down\n\nHere's what worked flawlessly for me on Windows 8.1 64 bit. I realize that this won't be neccesarry soon, but if you, like me, just bought it on sale for $5, you don't want to wait for this steamworks business.\n\nUninstall (if any) games for windows live things you have\nI'm fairly sure you need the legacy .NET framework installed. On win 8 hit win+x then F to get to programs and features. Then turn windows features on and off\nCheck all the .NET framework boxes for 3.5 and 4.5, just to be safe.\nI'm not sure where to find the current GFWL installer, but luckily I still have it from when I solved this trouble for one of the batman games, so I just made a shareable link from my google drive\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9rvE1lz9fK-aFFFYUNzMm5tOE0/view?usp=sharing\nInstall that guy\nIf you don't have a xbox live account, make a free one by going to signup.live.com, make an account, then sign in to xbox.com\nThe game should launch no problem, you'll sign-in and put in the key, It'll need an update, do said update and restart the game.\nSign in one more time\nThere all better. It looks like a lot of steps but it shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes.\n\nOn to the review.\nHad this game for 360 and played it for hours and hours. Beat the story a dozen times, got all the endings and all that jazz. I haven't tested multiplayer on the pc version yet, but it really made the game for me on xbox. A friend of mine and I did a 12 hour straight run through, doing every side mission and such, and it was awesome.\n\nThe graphics are fairly well improved from the xbox version, really it's just added anti-aliasing, but that makes it so much prettier.\n\nIf you enjoy creative weaponry, killing zombies, and B horror movie story lines, then this is the game for you. Unlike many sequel type things, In my humble opinion, this series has gotten better each time. So once you're done with this one, you should absolutely buy the third game, as it is even more amazing.","November 30, 2014","true","0.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The greatest asset of this game is the ways in which you can take the environement, and destroy hordes of zombies with it. With some of the most enjoyable weapons in games, memorable and challenging boss battles, some of the best coop gameplay I've seen in years, time management mechanics that add replayability, great controls, some nice visuals for the time of its release, a lovable Capcom style campy story and cheesy dialogue that keeps you anticipating the next one-liner, Dead Rising 2 offers hours and multiple playthroughs of fun.\n\nI'm also glad to say that the PC port is the superior version minus the lack of availability of the Case West DLC, and is actually one of the best PC ports I've played in a while. The PC controls are intuitive, the graphics are a step up from its console iterations, and the patches for the game's major issues on release (saving kicking coop partner and inability for coop partner to save progress are examples) is included.\n\nThe game has its problems however, which I think are necessary to point out for the sake of the reader and potential buyer. The first is the overabundance of quick-time-events. I honestly consider QTEs to be a bad mechanic 100% of the time, due to it stripping the gameplay to, "press x to watch what happens next" or, "press x to not die." Unfortunately this game makes you go through one everytime a zombie gets his hands on you. The button prompt changes everytime, so you can't just anticipate it and get it over with quickly, luckily the prompts are always one of the movement keys or waving the mouse around. The PC port's use of Game for Windows Live is probably the PC version's second greatest flaw. Games for Windows Live is horribly unoptimized, and is a chore to use in comparison to Steam. Another issue is one I previously mentioned, the fact that the Case West DLC has not been ported, and is not available on PC, so if playing Case West is a must for you, you might want to consider getting this game for PS3 or Xbox 360, although I'd argue it isn't worth the sacrifices made for the console versions. Two very minor complaints are Chuck's slow movement speed, because sometimes I find myself getting impatient with Chuck's inability to go faster than a jog, and how New Game+ doesn't up the difficulty any. I will say however, that New Game+ is fun in the way that you can try and complete all of the missions before their timers run out, due to you being much stronger.\n\nDespite its issues, Dead Rising 2 rounds out to be a wonderful game, that I whole-heartedly recommend buying.","December 9, 2013","true","25.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Why must I play a game with time constraints?\n\nIt is not necessarily a problem should there be a game mode where this can be turned off. But there's none. I know once you're done with the story the game offers a sort of unlimited game mode for the purpose of just eliminating zombies, still, I would prefer the gameplay Dead Island has. You can go around and look for lootable items and complete side missions and you can also trigger the next main story mission if you want. There are no time constraints here and everything can be done at your pace.\n\nI know there was a deliberate reason for not going ahead with this when Capcom came up with the series. It was decided with a purpose that there should be a time limit so that players cannot feel completeness - I think somewhere in a forum on the internet a guy put it right when he compared this game to the fun park experience of a child: the kid cannot really try out everything but must, instead, make a decision as to what to do and leave the rest for the future. It is all about making a priority list.\n\nSo, while the game feels rushed it seems you should set a priority to the list of things you want to do. And those you fail (including a lot of side missions where you need to save people) can later on be dealt with in your next playthrough. So, yes, I really understand what they were trying to pull off, still, I did not like it.\n\nIf you are not bothered by time constraints and you are OK with maximising everything throughout several playthroughs then Dead Rising 2 is clearly for you.\n\nAs for me: I like taking things at my leisure so this game felt too fast-paced and I was annoyed how many side missions I failed due to not being fast enough.

Nothing like dressing up in heart underwear and killing zombies with a gattling gun that shoots fireworks.\n\nKilling enemies are satisfying, though if you jump in expecting to be able to be all powerful you will be dissapointed.\n\nThe begining of the game can be slow as you are, well, slow and you dont have a lot of health. Luckly levels come easy and soon youll be able to enjoy this game much more.\n\nPC Port comments: I like it. It loads fast even on a HDD. Vehical controls arent outright terrible with makes getting first place in the opening sequence a breeze. Combat is, imo, better than on console. I havnt played around with key bindins but you might want to put weapon dropping on a different button.\n\nUInlike some ports, this one supports 1920x1080 and your max refresh rate (Im assuming it can go up to 144hz if you have a monitor that supports that, but my is stuck at 60hz)\n\nBesides the issues with sound in the beginning (The game would black screen before starting due to audio quality being OVER "24 bits, 48000 Hz (Studio Quality)". To fix, go to control panel>sound and right click on the device your using and choose properties, then go to advanced and change it to the above.)\n\nHavnt tried online, but i assume it works great now that GFWL is gone. Now i hope they do the same to RE5 soon.","November 23, 2014","true","1.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","9"

I initially dismissed this game as nothing more than a poor L4D competitor, I was wrong.\n\nDR2 is a completely different game, in almost every way. You have a RPG-styled character with upgrades and perks. You have hundreds of 'weapons' you can use to annoy or wipe out zombies. The storyline isn't too bad, but if you co-op through it with some crazy costumes on the main character, it has some hilarious cutscenes.\n\nStability wise, the game is not friendly to alt-tab, and the co-op play is also bug ridden with random disconnects. If you can stay together, it's a fun time battling missions, sharing weapons, building awesome combo weapons, driving new vehicles, and of course... killing zombies. Unfortunately, it's only a good experience about every 1 out of 3 or 4 times.\n\nIf you're a single-player person, you'll find a lot to do with a good campaign, and some very, very tough bosses. If you're in it for co-op, buckle up for some fun and frustration.","October 19, 2011","true","37.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not much of a challenge, there's a small slice of storyline, and the balance between missions and free time to ♥♥♥♥ around simply doesn't exist.... because everything is built to be "in fake-real time".  It's another Windows Live game, so don't be surprised when it doesn't validate properly, or you get connection issues.\n\nThe warnings aside, it's a fairly solid game with enough entertainment value, replay time, and funny crap to warrant around $20.  Waiting for a sale below that won't hurt.  The coop is acceptable, the zombie killing is satiable (with cleverness), and seeing Playboy covers all over the place with help your brain switch gears.\n\nI recommend outright failing the story right off the bat for the first one or two runthroughs so that you can have a good amount of time in between saving survivors and killing psychopaths to get familiar with your surroundings / controls, and to kill the ♥♥♥♥ out of zombies for the lulz!\n\n8 / 12","January 11, 2011","true","87.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The graphics and technology behind the game is severely dated and it plays and looks like a game much older than it actually is. The limited options and controls that's carried over from the console game doesn't help either.\n\nThe storyline is easily forgettable and the voice-acting is mediocre at best. The characters are 99% forgettable and main villain gets quickly pushed into the background by the various psychopaths wearing random costumes you will have to fight along the way.\n\nAll of this is forgivable however because of the pure simple mind numbing fun of the core gameplay: Killing zombies with whichever random and illogical object is at hand. It is a simple but hugely entertaining mechanic although one that should only be taken in small doses.\n\nThe game's multi-player works great as well although the fact that it uses GFWL will make it real hard to find people to play with.\n\nA good buy at a decent discount.","November 3, 2012","true","135.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Combo weapons, while fun to craft and utilize, make regular weapons like benches and chairs completely worthless. Rather than scrambling to find something to defend yourself with like in the first game, you often find yourself scrambling to find the next janitors closet to duct-tape knives to a boxing glove for the 500th time. The bosses are a step down in terms of humor, though not in challenge; while the average zombie is a bit docile in comparison to their counterparts first game.

I'm telling you, it's super effing simple to get a GFWL account and it's equally effing simple to get your gampad working. You need to make a hotmail or msn account to use when signing up for gfwl, There is a lot of bad information about what to download to get a gampad working out there. The app most people will direct you to downloaded has been updated to a version that will not work with dead rising 2. When you try to download this file from the official site you find from googling it on your own, you will be told the file is outdated. Click download anyway. Extract to your dead rising 2 folder, open the program and find your gamepad.\n\nSo there, the game works fine if you're willing to spend a little time fussing with it. If you have any questions about it not working feel free to message me and Ill try to help you through it.\n\n10/10 Even with a few shortcomings, I never get tired squiring zombies with ketchup and mustard before moving them down with a lightsaber in my underwear.","February 10, 2015","true","36.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","1"

No idea why most games didnt do the fallout 3 path adn give you a choice to use GFWL from the getgo.\n\nSo after far too long figuring out and actually fixing GFWL. You have to uninstall it, reinstall, update and restart your pc 3-ish times, make sure the double security is off on your live accont which may not be what you want so use a throwaway account... and is about to be removed from all games, capcom announced they will shift their games over to steamworks.\n\nThey had a sale before doing this though so headaches ahead. Ill keep this short, as for the game itself.\n\nIts okay. The combat is funny the use of everything from a sledgehammers and chainsaws to throwing hotdogs and the tables they were sitting on at enemies is good fun. However when thats the only enjoyable part of the game it gets old (even ducttaping two chansaws to the ends of a kayak paddle is only novel for so long)\n\nThe problem is the odd choice of zombies being what you'd expect form a zombie game, slow lumbering and in need of dismemberment and decaptiation to kill them, to the weird human (usually psychotic) bosses you come across trying to cook the other few survivors.\n\nFun concept but the human bosses dont work by the game rules established, you and zombies and other living people stumble, fall and react to being hit. These bosses are all on pcp and suffering early forms of madcow and run around faster than you can, do not stumble and when they do recover in an instant they hit you for insane amounts of damage where you and 20 12 gauge rounds barely dent their health.\n\nIf capcom ever sells this game for a couple bucks and GFWL is gone, itll be totally worth it for the zombie bashing alone. The animations are good (capcom games tend to do this very well) Its not for everyone though, once GFWL is gone itll have a good place in history, aside from the impossible bosses, they are sidequests though so they arent required. its just not for me and likely not for a lot of people.","September 13, 2014","false","10.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","4"

There are so many silly weapons I would love to utilize in a room full of zombies, but who has the time when you've got to find medication for your daughter and save every other nonundead human in the city?  The story's so grim, but the gameplay's so zany; and when the two are mixed, neither one is a positive experience.\n\nWhat the Dead Rising franchise needs is a sandbox mode:  No time pressure, and no one to save or escort or coddle, and maybe weapons that can endure more than just a handful of whacks-- Nothing but the freedom to explore and bash zombies to your heart's content.

It replaces much of the horror atmosphere of the first with a much more comedic tone and does it very, very well. It's bright, colourful and has lots of content. Remember this a zombie game that concentrates on melee combat as opposed to firemarms and the fact that it is a timed sandbx game also turns off some people, but not me!

It is all that a game should be.  Now I do think that this game does have some issues (coop being a little buggy sometimes, accidentally walking into damn psychopath battles when you are just walking around in the world, zombies being a tiny bit too easy to just wreck in pretty much any way, being able to ignore the zombies and walk away, and some craftable items being so good that you will be tempted to only craft them) but i think this game is brilliant over a few play throughs.

"TK" shows doctored footage of Chuck planting explosives on holding cells containing zombies. The plot of this game follows the events in the original Dead Rising, and the Xbox exclusive DLC game, Dead Rising: Case Zero. Chuck must fight his way through endless hordes of the undead, using a vast arsenal of objects used as weapons, rescue survivors, and solve the mystery of what or who began the "Fortune City" outbreak and blamed him for it.

But it can be a blast and it can be nice with a friend too although most of the time they see a bunny and pick it up :) But as for story wise views it has a ok story it dosen't feel solid and feels loose as you don't always go to the next mission straight away and sometimes it falls off the main plot to go do something else and may confuse you but the worst thing is the timer. Although it may be realistic it is pretty annoying for people who are looking for the full free roam aspect as it dosen't let you do everything you want in the certain time and may ♥♥♥♥ some people off but it can still be a blast in fortune city.\n\n79/100","April 17, 2014","true","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

However trying to play the game straight only ends up feeling like punishment, as you are limited on inventory space and time, meaning you can't arm yourself without grinding out some levels.\n\nOh and don't get me started on the boss fights. This game pulls boss battle straight out of the books of Mega Man. Forcing you into a contracted battle against big health bar bosses who can smash the crap out of you in one or two hits.

My reason to not recommend this game on PC/Steam is not because I dislike the game, I've actually been wanting to own this for years but I've been waiting until it became cheap enough on any platform to buy two copies so I can play with my partner. Well It seemed like a good deal on Steam...\n\nBUT BOY WAS I WRONG!\n\nThis game is plagued with installation, client update and registration issues. Honestly just Google "Dead Rising won't start in Steam", I wish I had done this prior to purchasing TWO copies. The game doesn't launch straight off the bat, It has issues launching Microsoft Games For Windows Live (GFWL) - Which is understandable considering no manual or company actually informs you that this needs to be installed until you've purchased the game and are frantically searching the web for answers. The problems don't end there, once GFWL is installed it requires you to log in about 3-4 times over and over as it has to do multiple updates, I experienced different outcomes for each of the two copies I installed. One updated fine and then threw constant errors trying to connect to XB Live. The other computer failed to install the second update then suggested I check the error logs buried deep in my User/Appdata folder. The troubleshooting and manual fixes just keep coming beyond this point. After finally logging into GFWL I managed to start a game only to have it Crash on me in the first cutscene. This is as far as I've got, I'm frustrated having paid $20 for each copy but after the many hours I've spent troubleshooting this game before even playing it I'd be annoyed even paying $5 for such an experience. In fact I'd put money on the fact that I would probably have a smoother ride getting a pirated game to work.\n\nThere is a fundimental problem plaguing PC gaming these days and if it weren't for hardcore PC gaming fans I doubt anyone would stick around and put up with this problem to support PC gaming.\n\nAll thanks to Pirating there now are OODLES too many third parties involved in the licensing and registration of games now. Long gone are the days where you could just buy a game on DVD, insert the disc, type a CD Key and 15mins later DONE! The game is ready to play, with maybe the exception of a minor patch.\n\nNow days EVERY godamn company involved with the games development or distribution has to clip the ticket and request you sign up to their own Game Client Service just so they can mine your personal information and gaming habits. Now I know this is somewhat designed to stop pirating but at what cost? This makes buying a legitimate game such a slow and painful process when you have to download multiple game clients, register multiple accounts and download multiple updates. Keep this up and people WILL pirate more! What makes the whole process even more painful and flawed is that none of these Third Party services seem to actually communicate or co-operate with one another, so when one link in the chain fails they all point fingers and the poor man in the middle (US GAMERS) seeks advice or support we get shunted in the opposite direction everytime... Think about asking for a refund? Your dreaming! IT'S A JOKE!\n\nThis is not an isolated issue either, it's affecting hundreds of games these days. I'm a hardcore PC Gamer, I've loved this platform for years but I'm just about OVER IT!","September 13, 2014","false","0.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Granted that some people will find the time element annoying, I personally find it well done and think it works.\nDR2 is all about killing zombies, and saving your daughter, although it is much, MUCH more free than any other game. If you wanted to, you could simply hide in a broom closet the whole game, you wouldnt get a very good ending, you wouldnt have much fun, but you can do it. Likewise, if you want to do every quest, you can go for it, although that is possibly the most stressful thing you can do.\nLike I stated previously, DR2 is more free than any other game, you can use whatever you want as a weapon, and you can combine things together. For instance, say you want a spiked bat, take a baseball bat and nails and put em on the workbench. Want a light sabe- sorry - laser sword? Take a flashlight and put some gems on it.\nsadly this game in all its humorous glory doesnt go without its fair share of glitches.\ngranted it is rare to run into them but there have been several reports of textures not appearing, and on occasion not being able to do a mission\nthe guide arrow is very misleading\nbut these flaws are few and far between\nthis game is a zombie killing RPG that doesn't take itself too seriously, and although it is a short review I give it my highest recommendation...\n9/10\n...\nthats what i would say\n\n\n\nBUT IN ALL REALITY: I cannot recommend this game as of now. Granted it is very fun, open and enjoyable, as it turns out GFWL is shutting down next year. meaning you can no longer play TIR, and you can no longer activate it or even save. that is the most disappointing part. this is a lot of wasted potential. do not buy at all costs get it for xbox","November 26, 2013","false","47.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","1"

I once had the game running and it looked great with no slowdowns anywhere but then there was a new update- now this game won't work at all. Even if you manage to get it working like I did before, there are still a lot of audio issues where the sound can't be heard during cutscenes and a few other similiar problems. Also, you can't deny the updates or you will be signed out of gfwl, so that is a huge killer as well. Try verifying cache files? - Well you will find that you will have to redo the updates all over again through gfwl.

Granted that some people will find the time element annoying, I personally find it well done and think it works.\nDR2 is all about killing zombies, and saving your daughter, although it is much, MUCH more free than any other game. If you wanted to, you could simply hide in a broom closet the whole game, you wouldnt get a very good ending, you wouldnt have much fun, but you can do it. Likewise, if you want to do every quest, you can go for it, although that is possibly the most stressful thing you can do.\nLike I stated previously, DR2 is more free than any other game, you can use whatever you want as a weapon, and you can combine things together. For instance, say you want a spiked bat, take a baseball bat and nails and put em on the workbench. Want a light sabe- sorry - laser sword? Take a flashlight and put some gems on it.\nsadly this game in all its humorous glory doesnt go without its fair share of glitches.\ngranted it is rare to run into them but there have been several reports of textures not appearing, and on occasion not being able to do a mission\nthe guide arrow is very misleading\nbut these flaws are few and far between\nthis game is a zombie killing RPG that doesn't take itself too seriously, and although it is a short review I give it my highest recommendation...\n9/10\n...\nthats what i would say\n\n\n\nBUT IN ALL REALITY: I cannot recommend this game as of now. Granted it is very fun, open and enjoyable, as it turns out GFWL is shutting down next year. meaning you can no longer play TIR, and you can no longer activate it or even save. that is the most disappointing part. this is a lot of wasted potential. do not buy at all costs get it for xbox","November 26, 2013","false","47.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","1"

Well, this was a ride.\n\nLet me just say it out of the bat.  It's a great game, it's fun, the characters are interesting, the gameplay is solid. It's a riot all the way. It's pretty short storywise, however the point of the game is replaying the campaign several times with better items, higher levels and trying to get all the content in the time you have alloted.\n\nThis game would be easily a 9/10 for me if not for 3 things:\n\n1. It took me some time to get it to work. Several tweaks, swapping data files, etc. to get it running. Be sure to check the forums before starting the game\n\n2. GFWL. I always get a bit concerned when a game has this service for online anything. It isn't as bad in this game, since you only need to confirm once when you start the game, but still.\n\n3. Controller. This game doesn't recognize any controller besides the 360 controller. so, if you have a dualshock or any other type, it won't read it.\n\nIf you can put up with those things up there, you'll get to enjoy a pretty enjoyable game.\n\nUpdate: Problems 1 and 2 are gone. After the steamworks update, the game doesn't require data and tweaks to run anymore and Steamworks is smooth as silk compared to GFWL old bloated overlay.\n\nComplete recommendation, get this or Off the Record when you get the chance.","November 27, 2013","true","40.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is still fun for its age buy the dlc though because it gets boring after playing it and buy off the record too. Only on sale though. So if you have the intent on buying this game make sure you have a wired/wireless xbox360 controller. I'll give you the link to a helpful video and the link to the thing you have to download. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoM01fHZm50\nwww.vendfx.info/X360\n\nAnd the graphics may seem a little outdated I mean they are, but you get a steady 60fps and there isn't much to tweak with the graphics. Lot of custumizable weapons fairly decent sized map. The only way to get around fast enough is if you get the dirt bike because its practically a walking simulator at best. But you'll get the hang of it once you start playing the game. And you can't plug in any controller and expect it to work IT WON'T. That's is why I put the links for the controller support ♥♥♥♥. And this is like the first semi-legit review I've typed up. So if this is helpful leave a comment. And the links work by the way. So I rate this game 8/10 because of the controller support.\n\nUpdate:\nI found this out last night. In order for the controller to work you have to uncheck native mode first and then uncheck force feed back. I was doing it wrong the entire time I was figuring it out myself. Watch the video closely. If theres any problems please tell me in the comments and I'll do my best to help you.

It offers you many options which is great fo both the high-end gamer as well as well as the gamers who are not so lucky.  The controls are decent. The art style is, well it's Capcom.. need I say more? Capcom = the king of average in the graphics department. The problem is that the game lacks personality. It hasn't a heart, nor a soul. In that way, the zombie theme is quite fitting.\n\nHmmm... maybe I just don't dig Capcom's sense of humor but this is probably the most boring zombie game out there, unless you find dressing up a guy in various women's clothing as entertaining. I rarely recommend other games over the game I'm reviewing in the actual review but I recommend Dying Light over this...\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/239140\n\nIf you're still interested in Dead Rising 2, I would strongly suggest looking the game up on YouTube to give you an idea of what it has to offer. It's more comedic than anything. It's like Saints Row but if you took all the good gameplay aesthetics and filled the game with zombies who have horrible ai. I'm quite disappointed because Dead Rising 3 on Xbox One/PC is so much fun. Can this one even be in the same family? Unoriginal, uninspired, plain rubbish compared to the 1st and 3rd in the series.\n\nCome on Capcom, this is the second game by you guys that I cannot recommend sadly.\n\nReview based on most current build, bought on a sale price.","February 26","false","2.1"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","8"

They released this game on steam and still didn't fix something, what is really easy to fix!!\n\nThere is story, also story that is limited by time, what is to be honest pretty annoying, there are so many great ways to kill zombies, but you can't really enjoy it as you are limited with time. I really enjoyed playing single player, making combos, finding hidden gems in Fortunate city everything while killing many many zombies. Zombies are everywhere just like it should be, that's the point of zombie games :)\n\nDead multiplayer is bugged, so I totally not recommend it for achievement hunters!\n- Progress in winning TiR for host doesn't count\n- Game crashes for every participant in the end of Slycycles competition,\n- When it crashes it doesn't save progress for everyone (there's steam guide how to make it save),\n- Problems in finding hosted lobby (you are just getting in the unending cycle of creating own lobby instead of join friend).\n\nWays that I was thinking about to fix this game: for example adding bots to TiR, making slycycles not crash, removing TiR achievements. Sorry I have always thought Capcom is too serious developer, so letting it be bugged like this is something unexpected.\n\nI will be happy to make this review positive once they fix it.\nBtw I'm on 17th place in TiR global rankings lol :D","March 10","false","75.5"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","17","35","0","4"

Spoiler altert... A man with a pice of glass who is way overpowered attempts to shank you in one of the bathrooms.\n\n2. Although this isn't as big as a problem as number 1, there is almost no way to find zombrex in this game without looking it up. I get that its a zombie appocalipse and you are trying to save your daughter who is infected, but why have this feature when it is almost impossible to find zombrex. The zombrex prediciment just takes away from the whole point of the game, which is killing zombies.\n\n3. you can't run, as if the developers just want to add time to the game.\n\nPros-\n\n1. Customization. Customization in this game is amazing. I love combining weapons and wearing different clothing, its a truely unique aspect of this game.\n\n2. Zombie killing is overall very enjoyable. Co-op with friends is even better.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 6.5/10.

So GFWL haters please skip this recommendation and don't buy it.\n\nUnlike other zombie-themed games, in this game, you are NOT gonna go on a full zombie-massacre spree. Instead, you have to RUN and AVOID zombies! Which kinda sucks.\n\nThe plot and gameplay is pretty boring if you're playing Single Player. Although it is considered as "Open World" game, each playthrough only lasted maximum of 4 in-game days. After 4 days, you will have to replay the whole plot again (with saved stats, like a New Game+). Also, each quest and side quests have a very limited time to complete, so if you're gonna go for the quests, you WILL run around doing errands in the entire game. Not much time to really explore.\n\nOf course, you can abandon the main quests and just do whatever exploring you want to do if you don't care about the plot and ending.\n\nDon't worry about how your character runs very slow in the game. Your running speed will increase as you level up in game. Also, don't worry about not able to beat any bosses in your first playthrough. As you level up, your attack damage will increase drastically too.\n\nIf you got a co-op buddy to play with, you can have a lot of fun in this game. It has a huge variety of items that can be combined into funny and interesting weapons. Also, there are a huge variety of shop and stores you can explore. You can wear a whole lot of clothes in game, as seen on my screenshots.\n\nThe online multiplayer is dead. No one play that game anymore.

Sadly this other wise fun game is getting a thumbs down because i have neither the time nor patients to deal with the BROKEN GFWL!

It's definitely an experience to leave a building and see hundreds of zombies milling about, all moving independently and all interactable. Most games only manage this number of enemies in cutscenes, not in actual gameplay. There's plenty of room to explore and experiment, and a ton of goofy weapons and skills. I'm really disappointed that there isn't a sandbox mode, but you'll make discoveries as you play through the game. A little too much time pressure, but definitely a lot of fun.\n\nFull review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2013/11/dead-rising-2.html","June 19, 2014","true","13.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The lack of custom waypointing makes rescuing survivors a headache. I just dragged two survivors into a boss fight and now have to restart from a previous savepoint. Speaking of which, the save system is a pain in the ♥♥♥ too.\nFurthermore, the grab distance to close doors and grab items is really short.\n\nIt's is a very addicting game. The zombie population is huge even when compared to Left 4 Dead as they fill up the horizon for miles. They are mostly avoidable but you will end up brawling quit a bit espeically at doors where they tend to pile up. Survivors do help, move efficently and can be given weapons to dispatch zombies. There are quite a number of zany ways to deal with them. Broadsword and Baseball Bat Mace seem the most effective so far.\n\nSo yeah.. fun game if you are willing to put up with some annoying issues.","August 19, 2014","true","13.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Be it Megaman or Res Evil 4, he just knows how to make a good thing better.  Dead Rising 2 may be a his magnum opus when it comes to that.  Epic jumping high kicks, sledgehammers taped to fire axes, giant bull horns, it's a lot of fun.  Even with a relatively weak weapon like the tomahawk can you get endless amounts of fun from chopping zombies.  Food (health) is everywhere so you're never really caught short, which applies to weapons as well.

Decent story, good gameplay.\n\nHowever, when i finished the game, i didn't want to play so much. Even the game doesn't touch your character level and learned combo cards, you have to restart the story if you want to play the game again. Of course, you can do other side tasks you didn't do before but... i think that's not so fun.

The zombie population is huge even when compared to Left 4 Dead as they fill up the horizon for miles. They are mostly avoidable but you will end up brawling quit a bit espeically at doors where they tend to pile up. Survivors do help, move efficently and can be given weapons to dispatch zombies.

It means you can't just explore, create new weapons and have fun, because if the arbitrary timer runs out it's the end of the game and you have to reload, often from quite a long way back. For this reason, I would recommend Dead Island in preference to this game.\n\n\n\n","November 1, 2015","false","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a pretty decent game with tonnes of potential. To top it all, it comes with a great plot which is the only thing to keeps me playing.\n\nAs you can already see, Dead Rising 2 is a zombie massacre game with seemingly illogical/nonsensical gameplay with a dash of humour. You can do cosplay, dress-up, mix and match almost anything you can find in the game to create new weapons and discover new ways to slaughter the zombies. But with all this, the plot actually comes up as rather serious and touching. Personally, I think the ridiculous dress-up (unless you buy the DLC) that comes with no purpose, spoils the mood. Imagine you are comforting your daughter dressed in a womens under garment.\n\nThe gameplay, as you can already see is exactly what and as it is. Each mission, you are to butcher your way out with whatever weapon you can find laying around. The weapons degrade rather quickly so you will need to get use to what is available to you. Combining weapons can be a chore as your inventory is extremely limited and finding the right weapons to combine requires you to do a little hunting while holding on to them. Not to mention you will need to stock up on food and bonus pamphlet (seems like it) that takes up even more inventory slot. Larger weapons/props does not allow you to store them so you will need to hold on to it as your primary weapon until you find a maintenance room.\n\nSide missions will require you to fetch items, escort survivors, fight mini bosses and etc. Survivors are annoying as they can come up with ridiculous requests and they also die rather easily. Handing them weapons is a great strategy but hanging to a good weapon for them will again take up your slot. I have no issue with the AI as the path finding and combat intelligent is alright. However, boss fights, again is another chore. You simply need to find the right timed action to perform and repeat until they dies.\n\nThis game solely focuses on killing zombies to the extend that they actually respawn right in front of you if you manage to clear them off in a large scale in an open area. Just like that, poof! and there appear right there. You cannot store weapons in your base when there are plenty of boxes/cupboard lying around. It is also really sad that you cannot expand or relocate your base when you can actually clear out the mall bit by bit.\n\nAfter a while, you will get bored and simply pushes off and avoid the zombies by travelling within the shop in the mall. I have no idea why the zombies will not spawn in the store. Maybe its because random looters will spawn in them time to time; which again makes no sense as they are yelling and breaking stuff but the zombies simply ignores them.\n\nMaybe on co-op it will give you more dynamics and options. I only manage to play the campaign and it really is annoying and frustrating rather then fun.","October 6, 2015","false","14.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The timed escort missions in this game aren't underwater, but damn if they aren't trying. What with how often you get put into long grabbing animations by zombies that you have to QTE your way out of.\nThe graphics look like ♥♥♥♥ for the most part, with textures on zombies that are about 256x256, no joke, and textures on humans that look to be about 1024x1024 at the greatest, but the game remains very well optimized. I can manage 60+ FPS even when there are hundreds of zombies on screen, so that makes up for the decreptitude of the graphics.\nThe gameplay of Dead Rising 2 is very advanced. The combat comes close to legendary titles like Devil May Cry 4 in depth, with profound mechanics like vomit cancelling and the part where you hit the lumbering undead with a large blunt weapon repetedly.\nOverall, this is a very good port. Extremely enjoyable co-op. 7 out of 10 Gamecubes.\nNot quite giga-cube level, but still a veritable source of giggles for you and an amigo possibly playing with you.\nAlso I never want to see a shopping mall again.","March 11, 2013","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

It is *extremely* cutscene heavy. Furthermore, it is using Games for Windows Live, a service that will be shut down on July 1, 2014. Even if the game utilised Steam's mechanics, this game is still so painfully slow.\n\nI managed to get into the mall to find loads of zombies and some objects. I pick up the object and attack the zombies, which with the sluggish controls, doesn't help the situation either. And then I find my items deteriorate after 10(?) hits.\n\nIf this sounds like your game, then go for it - I'd only give caution about Games for Windows Live. If this game seems tedious, that's because it is, and Steam offers far better zombie games from AAA developers as well as indie developers.

Now Tom is a reasonable guy, good head on his shoulders, and has a knack for coming up with good ideas. Lumpy was placed there because he was someone's cousin and someone owed someone else a favor. Lumpy is not a good designer. Lumpy's only talent is to uncerimoniously shart on any new idea presented such that it immediately becomes terrible.\n\nBut because he's someone's cousin and someone owed someone else a favor, Lumpy gets veto power over Tom.\n\nSo the two sit down at the first development meeting and I imagine the conversation going thusly:\n\nTom: I think a more open world-style game that allows the player to explore and roam at will through a large area would work best. We can make it a casino, that way there's plenty to do and look at.\n\nLumpy: Perfect! We can break everything up into chunks that take forever to get through unless you run and miss most everything interesting!\n\nTom: Erm...ok, so as far as story, let's have the plot revolve around the main character's daughter. They've developed a cure but she has to keep taking it.\n\nLumpy: Great! We can attach it to a timed mechanic that means you have to sprint through the complex and sprawling levels to get back to her to give her medicine or else she dies and the game instantly ends.\n\nTom: Ummm...I guess. I was also thinking we could do the custom weapons thing again. See what kind of crazy things players will come up with.\n\nLumpy: I love it! Then we'll make these weapons super fragile so they break near immediately and the components are hard to get so you don't get to use them hardly ever and the rest of the time you just have to wail on zombies with whatever is handy!\n\nTom: *sigh* Ok, ok, ok. The main character is a reporter, so let's include a kind of photography system. Adds a new dimmension to game play and opens up a lot of avenues for sharable content and humor.\n\nLumpy: Brilliant! We can force that to be a core part of gameplay and jerk the player out of the action and tension with unnecessarily long animations and grading screens!\n\nTom (who by now is close to tears): I...I guess we can do that...but we need something to add some tension to the game. The daughter thing is good but some overarching tension in terms of the surroundings would be great.\n\nLumpy: I know! Let's have the whole game run on a timer so that you have to race through and miss most of the cool stuff before the time runs out or you automatically die! And it'll mean people have to replay the game over and over again!\n\nTom: ...I hate you so much right now.\n\n\n\nThat's about the formula for the game; take one good idea and smash it to death with bad ones until you find yourself sobbing at your desk asking the game gods why and wishing dearly to be able to get this game out of your library.","October 30, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","2"

As i remember, first DR had possible but hardcore missions and newbie traps, it required you to get used to it, i didn't mind failing and leveling up a little more to complete the story line, it gave you enough time for that and it felt fair. In DR2 you are punished for not knowing locations of zombrex along with other factors, that limit your free-playtime, FORCING you into multiply re-starts if you are playing for fun. New main character is pretty likable because he represents the player in this new "insane and random" style, making him the only sane sober-thinking person in the game, not much else though. As i said, this franchise has gone into the same thing that Saints Row did, game that focuses on the fun-factor and comedy/parody more than anything else. But it failed even with that there for a bit. Now that i've finished bashing this game, i would like to say a few nice things. Gore is really good, more ways to kill zombies with a new crafting system. more drivable transport, few good psychopath themes. Buy DR Off the record though. Because Frank West + more content + fixes.","April 27, 2015","false","45.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

This game is AWESOME!!!\nThere is so much things to do in a fairly big map: thousands of items to discover, plenty of side missions, side bosses, combining items to make new weapons, mixing drinks to create potions, secret areas, shortcuts, combos, minigames, reading magazines to boost your status and much more! Oh, and don't forget the very well made coop that lets you enter in your friends game at any time with your character.\nThere is absolutely no reason to complain about the game itself. I agree that the first one is better, but this one is amazing as well.\nAnd about the DRM thing... yes, it's a pain in the ♥♥♥, but is working (for me at least, using win7).

The money goes to his daughter, who has the "infection" that, if untreated, leads to her becoming a zombie.\n\nOnce again, like in Dead Rising, you are in a mall, trying to find survivors and ocasionally running into psychopaths that need to get their head smashed in. This is also where the nudge of humor comes in, these psychopaths are often hysterical and over the top, making it that much more fun to kill them. The open-world offers allot of space for looking around and looting, don't forget to find Zombrex for your daughter along the way.\n\nThe game also offers online co-op mode in which both players, play as Chuck. Only the host will be able to save the game, but you keep all experience and items throughout the game.\n\nThere are multiple different endings and all are worth checking out.\n","October 1, 2014","true","16.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I was very into L4D2 logging over 200 hours into it. I had expected Dead Rising 2 to be in the vain of L4D but in third person and whole lot more zombies. Instead I got an open world zombie game with slow pacing, long grind, clunky combat and unbalanced boss fights.\n\nPros:\nRuns well on a AMD Phenom II X4 940, 2GB DDR2 and GTX 670. Sometimes under 60fps.\n\nCons:\n-Huge grind. As described below about boss fights, you need to level up in order for boss fights to be fair. I am at level 20 and boss fights are still not balanced at all. Avoiding boss fights can be futile at times as described below.\n\n-No running. You walk faster by levelling up. Levelling up auto assigns attributes (attack, speed, life etc..) so their is no customization. I am currently at level 20 and still walk very slow.\n\n-Time based gameplay, all missions are based on a certain time, the absence of running really adds frustration to this as you cannot get to some missions in time, especially story missions that forces you to load from a user savepoint which could be 30 mins back.\n\n-Save points are limited to "restrooms", if you can find them and remember to do so. Current game design is that after every mission the game should auto-save. Not with Dead Rising 2, if you had beaten a hard fought boss, you must remember to find a restroom ASAP. Even then, you could be low on health after this boss fight and die on the way to a restroom.\n\n-Numerous boss fights that are unbalanced. You need to be leveled up and on a 2nd playthrough in order for the boss fights to be fair. These boss fights show up in your missions list and you have to assume from the mission description that you will fighting someone, it doesn't tell you outright. I essentially have to read, thnk and pick rescue type missions in order for me to level up so when I do encounter bosses, it will be more fair but so far still unbalanced. Even if you intend to avoid boss fights, some missions force you to go into a certain area which will trigger a boss fight, and because you walk so slowly, it is difficult to evade the boss fight after","April 3, 2015","false","35.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

But it falls short of almost everything it offers and it's attempt at being less shallow with the time constraint actually makes the game even worse. If you had the ability to take your time and just kill and explore at your pace the game would have gotten at least a C.\n\nThere is no support for a game controller unless you spend some time getting a control emulator (which is ridiculous in this day and age, especially for a game that's basically a console game). This alone may make you hate the game before you even get to play it.\n\nThis game means well, but it doesn't do almost anything for the zombie genre.

Keep scrolling, because this is a port rant.  No, it's not just GFWL, calm down.\n\nEven with GFWL gone, this port is dreadful.  While the game itself is definitely worth the asking price, I can't recommend it unless you love super-cinematic 15 FPS at random times, along with several pathetic issues that ruin it for you.\n\nFirst off, one of my smaller annoyances.  The textures are horrendous.  I don't mean "old-looking" horrendous, I mean that they look like crippled and downscaled versions of textures, like they're rendering in 1/4 res or something.  I sincerely doubt that these are the textures they made-- it's probably just the downscaled versions of the textures that they used for Xb360/PS3.  I wouldn't complain, had performance actually been somewhat decent.\n\nRegardless of your framecap (which is nicely placed at 120FPS... we're making progress, Capcom) Cinematics also seem to be at-- you guessed it-- "cinematic" 30 FPS.  Want to hear something even worse?  In both cutscenes AND gameplay, your mouse cursor will just appear at random times!  I've even tried alt-tabbing out and restarting the game, but no, it's just the port!  It's got THAT little effort behind it!\n\nThe controls are a bit all over the place.  C for the Transponder, T for your watch, and a million other stupid binds that anyone could have placed better.  It's another small complaint, but definitely worth mentioning.\n\nI find with MSi Afterburner's overlay enabled that RAM usage will never go over 2GB, only 300MB max will be used of my 3GB R9 280 (usually hovering around 30% usage with max settings), and the CPU will just tank performance at random times-- yes, even during cutscenes and in the shelter, where NOTHING should be that taxing, I'm getting 100%/99% usage for my cores.\n\nThe port woes make this game unenjoyable.  Avoid it, unless you've got enough processing power to brute-force it.  Even then, you're not missing out on much.  Capcom is a joke, and I highly suggest avoiding their products as nothing they release has been even half decent on PC.","July 6, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

The survivor A.I. is much better scripted, the layout of the map isn't nearly as obnoxious as it was in the original either... Also, the timer is a lot more mangable and if you follow a survivor rescuing guide you'll realize how much Capcom actually spoon feeds us the survivors this time around... In DR1 it was a disaster to have to guide back more than a couple people, in DR2, it's embraced... the larger the group, the more survivability it has.\n\nI found Chuck to be a lot more stoic and bad ♥♥♥ than Frank West and I assume that's what they were going for but playing this after playing DR2: OTR, you realize how much of a blank slate Chuck really is... almost downright boring to watch... but before that little mistake happened, he was just a total bad ♥♥♥.\n\nMy only gripe is that there's little to no reason to head in to the underground tunnel section of the game and I remember that being one of the most terrifying things about DR1... is that you were essentially forced down there for a lot of reasons... you briefly skim part of it this time around. Also there's a plethora of combo cards in this game and unfortunately 95% of them are novelty gag's or downright worthless. The easiest and earliest combo weapons you can make are among the best in the game, which leaves you little to nothing to look forward to.\n\nThe game is much more fair than DR1 which is a great and bad thing all at once. The problem with making things fair in a survival horror game is that it takes away a lot of the fear you'd normally have playing it... Although in this game's defense, you can't really begin to play it seriously until you hit level 50... Trying to accomplish anything profound before level 40 and you're basically zombie fodder.

Kudos to Steam for helping make that change.  I'm absolutely certain that this will return some good will for people who felt ripped off that they'd paid for an unplayable game (BTW...doing the same for other GFWL titles, would be great).  I know that it made me feel a lot better about Steam's response to the problem, especially as a very long-time Steam member.\n\nAs for the game itself, I'm still pretty torn and can't wholly recommend it on PC.  It's a fairly clunky port from consoles, and honestly it probably plays better on those (which pains those of us who are PC gamers).  The save system is still very console-focused and pretty annoying, as a lot of checkpoints are set in an area where there is a high potential of death, and then you're stuck replaying quite a bit just to take another run at the same thing.\n\nThe reality is that other zombie titles play much better on PC...Left For Dead 1/2, Dead Island, etc.  If you've blasted through all of those and simply need another zombie killing game on your PC and this is on sale (like it currently is), then it's perhaps still worth it.  Otherwise, move on to stronger titles or at least wait until this one is on sale.\n\nI the meantime, I reluctantly can't give the game a recommendation, even though it's decent.  I'd probably give it a thumbs-up on a console.","March 17, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

NOW!\n\nP.S. So hilarious to read lil kids struggling with GFWL. Yeah, that takes me back. But hey, young ones, it's all solvable you just need to try harder. I beat WL like 5 years ago maybe more and it's worked flawlessly for me ever since. And trust me, it used to be much worse, they really simplified it by now.\nSo good luck.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/45740/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Disclaimer - I do not own Dead Rising 2, I have played the game via Steam family share.\nDead Rising 2 is an open world survival horror beat 'em up game which was released in mid 2010 on both console and PC. You play as Chuck Green, who is a motocross rider, as you try to survive a zombie outbreak. The game is set in a shopping and casino complex which is filled with zombies. You encounter up human survivors throughout the game, as well as finding and crafting weapons.\n\nGame play wise; Dead Rising 2 is a very typical hack and slash style. You find weapons around the levels such as crowbars, sledge hammers, pistols, right the way up to silly items such as garden rakes and party hats.  As you progress through the story you get more experience  points from completing missions and saving survivors. The game is also heavily based around time constraints too; you have to do missions at certain times; if you miss the time you either loose the game or the mission is gone and you can never finish it. This to me made me have to make a lot of sacrifices to what content I actually got to see; I personally didn't see a huge need to have the time constraints in place as you just end up missing out on content that the developers have worked hard to make.\n\nThat being said; all of the missions and side quests are virtually all the same. Side missions consist of finding the survivor, and escorting them back to your safe house. Whilst main story missions are "walk here" and "kill that" goals. To me the lack of creativity really felt like it let the game down here.\n\nGraphics wise; Dead Rising 2 is a game which has been out for close to five years now. Whilst at a glance the graphics look OK, but if you get a closer look you can really tell the age of this title. Poor quality textures are the main culprit here. I can sort of forgive it as it is an open-world game though.\n\nThe main story right up to the ending had me intrigued the whole way through. Although some of the plot twists are kind of predictable if you pay attention; it was still enough to keep me interested. Sadly though the ending of the game really annoyed me. I don't want to spoil it for people but it kind of had an anticlimax feel to it which didn't leave a nice taste in my mouth afterwards.\n\nDead Rising 2 isn't exactly a difficult game, there are a couple QTE type actions you have to carry out when you are grabbed by a zombie, but personally I found the most difficult aspect of the game was to be finding weapons which don't completely break from durability loss after a couple of hits. Ammo for guns is few and far between so the majority of the time you are in melee - so ideally you need a couple of melee weapons each mission due to them breaking all the time. Towards the end of the game, if you managed to rescue a couple of survivors, you really do become quite overpowered; once my speed skill was maxed out I was able to dodge most  zombies when running between objectives. Boss fights are pretty "meh" too; none of them have any real difference, they all tend to be just a regular enemy but with more health. I did find the fight with the helicopter to be quite interesting but that was the only real original boss fight concept in the game.\n\nEach zone/level is pretty hectic, like I said, you can have up to 7000 zombies on your screen at any time, there are an abundance of items to pick up and craft into different weapons, not to mention lots of little Easter eggs to find, such as playing a golf simulator. The atmosphere in each of the levels actually really reminded me of Las Vegas; and if you have been there it will really feel like you are there in the game (even though you aren't there location wise in the story).\n\nA full playthrough of Dead Rising 2 with the majority of side quests being completed, took me just over ten hours. I personally cannot see any reason why I would play through the single player story again as it's very linear and you cannot change the events that take place. The multiplayer is also pretty derelict too - at the time of writing this, there are only 40 people in the game.\n\nTechnically I didn't have major game breaking issues; just a small gripe with the crazy amount of loading screens this game has. Literally every couple of minutes you get a loading screen, whether it be for a cut scene, ending of a cut scene, changing zone, I counted 7 loading screens in the space of 10 minutes at one point. For me, that is unacceptable and I am surprised not many people actually picked up on it.\n\nIn conclusion; do I recommend Dead Rising 2? Personally I wouldn't recommend it at full price. For starters there are much better zombie games like this out there in the form of Dead Island. The game's length is too short for me - and all this being compounded by lack of multiplayer activity just makes this a single player game. So I cannot recommend Dead Rising 2 at full price; if you can get it for at least 50% off, you may as well pick it up as it's an OK open world title, but nothing more.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

My own experience with this game was pretty poor. The game was glitchy, my character would constantly stop moving and restart running although I never let go of the key. My controller that works with all my other steam gamepad games did not work with this one. I find it annoying how there is no free play mode, and there is only the campaign, so I have to be on a timer constantly instead of just messing around and killing zombies like I wanted. The thing that set me off the absolute most though was the fact that I didn't notice that the game does not autosave. I played it for about four hours, and got decently far, and I was killed by a boss who kept attacking from off screen. After the game over screen, I saw an option to load..... from the very first bathroom in the game you save at. At this point I lost all investment. I could imagine someone else may be able to look past these things, and have fun with this game. My own experience however was a complete mess, and at this point, I don't want to give it another chance.","March 17, 2015","false","5.3"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoxOperator/recommended/45740/","FoxOperator","FoxOperator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoxOperator/","40 products in account","If you played Dead Rising 1, this game will be familiar, if you didn't, take a deep breath, because this is a different game from any other you will play.\nIt seems like a standard third person shooter/RPG with where you fight humans and zombies. But it's not, because of the timer system. Because of story reasons, you, Chuck Greene, participant of the tv show Terror Is Reality as a motorcycle pilot, have a total of 72 Hrs(Something like 14 hrs in real time, can't really remember though) to survive. During these 72 Hrs, you can save survivors and escort them back to your safehouse(Some survivors that were saved, I give you a sidequest, but not immediately), you can fight the psychopaths(The bosses) and there are events which you won't be informed and will start and end at their own, and there are the cases, which start at a determined time and end. If you miss the survivors, they die, if you miss the psychopaths, they disappear, and if you miss a single case, you fail at the story, although you can atill continue and finish the game.\nThe game takes place on the Canadian-Japanese view of Las Vegas, named here Fortune City, it's a great location, it is wide and full of clothing stores, tool stores, restaurants, fast foods, amusement spots and a giant open local that allows you to traverse it with your motorcycle.\nChuck Greene is a father, and needs to find Zombrex(Anti Zombie Infection Medicine) to his daughter Katey, if you don't apply the Zombrex on her, she dies and you fail the story.\nDoes it look fun? No. Is it fun? It depends. I had a great time, but you might not. First you need to endure the very clunky controls, and while the game gives you all the tools the get around(Dodge Roll, a Flying Kick for example), in the actual heat, the game doesn't play like it should, because there is this small delay that when you do something, it doesn't work right away.\nThe story is your fairly standard zombie conspiracy thing, but it still has great moments. Chuck is likable because he has a goal to protect his daughter and save the survivors, but he still has his brilliant moments of puns and word play.\nThe map is huge, and to unlock the best kind of shortcuts, you must progress the story and save survivors. Don't rely to much on the giant arrow that points to the objective, because usually the path isn't straightfoward, so the arrow will confuse it self, and saving the game is made on bathrooms or beds, the game does not have checkpoints, so if you die, back to the save spot.\nThe combat mainly consists of melee and unarmed, one button to attack, another to aim and throw/fire, and holding the attack button allows you to do an alternative attack(On some weapons). Using weapons found in the scenery like a baseball bat or a handgun is cool(Well the handgun and all other firearms with the exception of the Sniper Rifle sucks) but real deal is picking weapons and items and whatever to make combo weapons, like a spiked bat, flamethrower or a pair of boxing gloves with chef knives. You a combo card by leveling up, examining a poster of a movie, defeating a boss or even by saving survivors. If you somehow managed to combine a weapon without it's card, you will get half of the normal PP and you won't be able to do the alternative attack. You heal using food, some foods give you health normally, and you can cook and fry some food types to prevent then from rotting and make their heal factor bigger, if they rot however, they're worthless.\nThe game is arcady and not realistic, and expected lots of weird systems that don't make huge amount of sense. Like any good old RPG, you level up by killing, completing quest, taking down bosses, saving survivors, and heating a pan?\nThere is alot to do in the mall, and neat little things that make a difference, for example, if you take some ingredients to a blender you can make a juice that works like a buff(Spitfire allows you to you know, spitfire) and go to blenders often because these buffs are super useful.\nThe game can be experienced with a partner online, but if you're planning to actually do the campaign, I advise playing with a buddy that it's up to the task, because there are some co-op annoying stuff(Friendly Fire, leaving an area requires the two players together).\nIf it wasn't for the GFWL, this game would be better, but fear not, this game will have functionalities transferred to Steam Works this year.\nIt doesn't looks incredible, but it allows 2000 models if I recall at a time on the screen, and it's great, a really great and refreshing game best played with a buddy. I wished I could talk about the multiplayer versus that actually is the show Terror Is Reality, but no one plays :(","January 4, 2015","true","54.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoxOperator/recommended/45740/","FoxOperator","FoxOperator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoxOperator/","40 products in account","If you played Dead Rising 1, this game will be familiar, if you didn't, take a deep breath, because this is a different game from any other you will play.\nIt seems like a standard third person shooter/RPG with where you fight humans and zombies. But it's not, because of the timer system. Because of story reasons, you, Chuck Greene, participant of the tv show Terror Is Reality as a motorcycle pilot, have a total of 72 Hrs(Something like 14 hrs in real time, can't really remember though) to survive. During these 72 Hrs, you can save survivors and escort them back to your safehouse(Some survivors that were saved, I give you a sidequest, but not immediately), you can fight the psychopaths(The bosses) and there are events which you won't be informed and will start and end at their own, and there are the cases, which start at a determined time and end. If you miss the survivors, they die, if you miss the psychopaths, they disappear, and if you miss a single case, you fail at the story, although you can atill continue and finish the game.\nThe game takes place on the Canadian-Japanese view of Las Vegas, named here Fortune City, it's a great location, it is wide and full of clothing stores, tool stores, restaurants, fast foods, amusement spots and a giant open local that allows you to traverse it with your motorcycle.\nChuck Greene is a father, and needs to find Zombrex(Anti Zombie Infection Medicine) to his daughter Katey, if you don't apply the Zombrex on her, she dies and you fail the story.\nDoes it look fun? No. Is it fun? It depends. I had a great time, but you might not. First you need to endure the very clunky controls, and while the game gives you all the tools the get around(Dodge Roll, a Flying Kick for example), in the actual heat, the game doesn't play like it should, because there is this small delay that when you do something, it doesn't work right away.\nThe story is your fairly standard zombie conspiracy thing, but it still has great moments. Chuck is likable because he has a goal to protect his daughter and save the survivors, but he still has his brilliant moments of puns and word play.\nThe map is huge, and to unlock the best kind of shortcuts, you must progress the story and save survivors. Don't rely to much on the giant arrow that points to the objective, because usually the path isn't straightfoward, so the arrow will confuse it self, and saving the game is made on bathrooms or beds, the game does not have checkpoints, so if you die, back to the save spot.\nThe combat mainly consists of melee and unarmed, one button to attack, another to aim and throw/fire, and holding the attack button allows you to do an alternative attack(On some weapons). Using weapons found in the scenery like a baseball bat or a handgun is cool(Well the handgun and all other firearms with the exception of the Sniper Rifle sucks) but real deal is picking weapons and items and whatever to make combo weapons, like a spiked bat, flamethrower or a pair of boxing gloves with chef knives. You a combo card by leveling up, examining a poster of a movie, defeating a boss or even by saving survivors. If you somehow managed to combine a weapon without it's card, you will get half of the normal PP and you won't be able to do the alternative attack. You heal using food, some foods give you health normally, and you can cook and fry some food types to prevent then from rotting and make their heal factor bigger, if they rot however, they're worthless.\nThe game is arcady and not realistic, and expected lots of weird systems that don't make huge amount of sense. Like any good old RPG, you level up by killing, completing quest, taking down bosses, saving survivors, and heating a pan?\nThere is alot to do in the mall, and neat little things that make a difference, for example, if you take some ingredients to a blender you can make a juice that works like a buff(Spitfire allows you to you know, spitfire) and go to blenders often because these buffs are super useful.\nThe game can be experienced with a partner online, but if you're planning to actually do the campaign, I advise playing with a buddy that it's up to the task, because there are some co-op annoying stuff(Friendly Fire, leaving an area requires the two players together).\nIf it wasn't for the GFWL, this game would be better, but fear not, this game will have functionalities transferred to Steam Works this year.\nIt doesn't looks incredible, but it allows 2000 models if I recall at a time on the screen, and it's great, a really great and refreshing game best played with a buddy. I wished I could talk about the multiplayer versus that actually is the show Terror Is Reality, but no one plays :(","January 4, 2015","true","54.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it's the same good zombie fun, captures the original's feel very well, and expands on it with new content and features, more zombies, a bigger mall, lots of secrets to uncover, and multiplayer.

I was primed for a roaring trek through a zombie-filled city, where dispatching the undead was hilarious fun and the key to success. The actual game (when I finally got it to work) is a boring loop of backtracking through the same, small piece of real estate, where killing zombies borders on being an afterthought.\n\nMaybe "Dead Rising 2" is supposed to be a parody of itself? I don't know. If there's a joke, I'm not getting it.\n\nAnyway.\n\nThe idea of having a very tight time limit on the various goings-on is actually a great idea. It forces you to prioritize and creates a killer sense of tension. The realization that I'd have to find Zombrex for my kiddo, by myself, and on an actual deadline definitely got my attention.\n\nThe problem is that the thing you would think would be fun and central - taking out zombies - turns out to be boring, clumsy, and peripheral. Combat and associated movement is ponderous and awkward, with a high likelihood that you'll be grappled. There are HUGE delays between an attack animation and the next action, making fights feel walking through quicksand. Kills net you a miniscule amount of experience, and experience is only good for making you incrementally better at...getting kills. Weapons break very quickly, which makes the slog of weapon crafting (pick this up, set it down, pick up another thing, several-second cutscene, off you go) seem monumental after only a few go-arounds.\n\n...and, as I said, it's peripheral. You don't get anything useful from zombie killing. You don't find anything to trade, which means that combat doesn't provide an alternate path to getting Zombrex for Katy. The zombies apparently respawn, which means that putting a large dent in the population fails to make getting around any easier.\n\nSpeaking of getting around: The real key to the game (other than the main missions) seems to be going out into the world and bringing folks back. Fair enough, I suppose, but the repetition is boggling. There's exactly one way in and out of the shelter, which means you're going to be seeing the same thing over, and over, and over, and over again while getting bogged down by zombies over, and over, and over, and over again. Once you find somebody, there follows an infuriatingly awkward sequence of trying to talk to them, such that they'll "join" you. The gaps in time between character thoughts being voiced (and anything happening) are so large that you could comfortably taxi a large aircraft through them...and sometimes, the "follow me" script won't trigger on the first attempt.\n\nAfter only a couple of hours, I thought to myself: "If this is going to be the whole game, I think I'll do something else." As I said, the feel of the experience is that a few ideas for some open-world game elements were implemented without regard for how they fit together - and then somehow shipped as a complete product.\n\nNo, thank you.","June 15, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With a crafting system that allows players to create weapons out of random junk they find lying around to battle the hordes of zombies quite literally biting at your heels, is somewhat satisfying. The story itself being that it is a Capcom game could be taken with a grain of salt, but none the less it is engaging enough to want you to keep playing.\n\nTo be fair the PC port of this game I find to be the best version to play this game, what with the smoother frame rates, better graphics, and the option to use a controller or mouse and keyboard. Most people would think that mouse keyboard would fall under controller in a game like this but I actually though the port did a very good job tightening up the controls.\n\nThe multiplayer co-op this game features really nails in the enjoyment factor for this game, not only can you look like a psychopath but you can have a friend doing the same right alongside you.

Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","Dumb & simple zombie killing fun.\n\nLike the first game, weapons and health are generally all around you only this time around you can combine two specific items to make another weapon that's possibly cooler, sillier, practical, or a combination of a number of those. You can find out what item goes with what via Combo Cards which are unlocked through general progression of the game such as examining certain posters, leveling, defeating psychopaths, etc. You can combine items without the specific card however the item produced won't be as effective and rewarding. It's highly encouraging to produce the Combo Weapons because using them generally nets you PP for leveling and curiosity in how they'll work will become pretty high.\n\nYou're free to run around the world as you please (aside from some areas that can only unlocked from doing certain missions) though its criticized time limit makes a return so you only have so much time to get to doing the missions. If you stick to doing missions, not be as distracted, and perhaps if you're at a decent level it won't feel like it's rushing you to go do something so much. Even if you fail a task no matter how important and until the timer runs out or you choose to restart the story you're free to run around freely doing whatever. Restarting the specific save file's story allows you to keep your level, money, and Combo Cards for that next playthrough.\n\nThe plot & dialogue is full of cheese, especially with the psychopaths. I think it's for the better that that's the case.\n\nThere isn't much depth to the actual zombie killing aside from just having good weapons for the situation and the psychopath fights. The psychopaths can be extremely cheap in their own special way but at least for most of the fights you're free to leave and return to the area in case you don't feel ready for the boss fight.\n\nThe co-op's overall doable. A bit easier (if no lag is present) but adds enjoyment to the game. The money and level you've earned anywhere in a save file can be used in both single player and co-op where the only thing that doesn't carry over for either is the story if you're not hosting the game.

This game is so much fun! Kicking zombies butts with knifes attached to boxing gloves, in a big ♥♥♥ shopping mall is truly f**** amazing. The combo weapons are one of the main new features in this installment. Crazy combinations like a Power Drill+ Spear , Wheelchair+ Battery or even  SquirtGun+ Gasoline can cause total DESTRUCTION! But Sadly, the combinations are limited. You can see the different combinations by collecting combo cards, wich can be acquired by leveling up and many other ways. Despite the awesome gameplay, the story is also kinda great. You play as Chuck Greeene, a motocross champion who came with his  bitten daughter Katey, to Fortune City( a mix of shopping malls and casinos ) to participate in a reality tv show called ''Terror Is Reality'', in order to win some money to buy his daughter some doses of the highly expensive Zombrex. Then sudddenly, Zombies from the show are released, causing an outbreak in Fortune City. And if things werent bad enough, Chuck is claimed  by the medias, ''responsible'' for causing the outbreak. So basically the main goal of the story is to clear your name and escape Fortune City. One of the good things about this game, is that you are not in obligation to follow the story. This is great for younger players who wants to mess around and have some fun killing the zombies. However, one thing I dont like about Dead Rising 2 is the psychopaths/bosses. Some of them like the chef, are way too hard to defeat when you are low level and dont know the game very well. In my opinion, the most easy and proper way to defeat them, is by grabbing one or two snipers, a couple of orange juice/lobster and some magazines that increases the damage you inflict with guns. That is just boring for a boss battle. In  conclusion, if you are new to Deadrising , get this game. And if you are already familiar with the franchise, get Off The Record. In this version of DeadRising 2, Frank West ( Hero of the first Deadrising), is the main protagonist. The game also includes a Sandbox mode. A mode where you have no objectives and can do whatever you want! So go check it out! I rate DR2 8/10 for its zombie killing madness.","June 27, 2015","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No customer should be expected to jump through hoops to try and fix a game that should have been playable out of the box. Steam should especially be ashamed for distributing such a broken game. Would really like to ask for a refund. If you are looking at purchasing this game, please reconsider. It is BROKEN. Also please note, avoid any game that has a third person party packaged with it ie: GFWL. This will also cause you problems. This game could have been a great port, but apparently Capcom and Steam did not feel it necessary to invest the time to fully explore the flaws so prevalent in this game. The "fixes" in the forums are poor excuses for solutions. In fact they are not solutions at all. Once again, a customer should not be expected to have to download, and download, and download again to fix a game that should have been playable to start with. Also, full controller support is a flat out lie. I have an xbox 360 controller, and that option does NOT work.\n\nUpdated 3/20/15: Since the conversion to Steamworks, Everything seems to be in working order. No longer am I having issues with non existent controller support, ridiculously lengthy loading times, endless GFWL "updating" messages, and just the general malaise associated with the DRM that should never have been spawned. I can now enjoy the zombie splattering madness that only Xbox players could. Cheers.","December 8, 2013","true","27.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

Butcher zombies with anything you can find lying around, or tape shizz together and unleash hell with combo weapons (I recommend the electric chair :-P). Excellent storyline with a fair amount of twists and turns. There's an extended/alternate "Overtime" ending which only occurs if certain choices are made during the story. You don't even have to play the story, you can just spend your time chopping up rotten zombies and level up for when you restart the story. All key items and your level is transferred over when you restart the story which is a massive bonus in my opinion.

With so many combo weapons and awesome psycopaths to boot, this game takes what Dead Rising 1 had and expands it further. So many ways to kill zombies and achievements to unlock is what gives this game so much replay value. Defiantly worth getting.","June 14, 2012","true","80.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
