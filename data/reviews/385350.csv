This game is alot of fun with really nothing to do. Im looking forward to having alot of hours in this.

Not like mine, I'm still on Windows7.  Though, I wish it would work better for me. It is great though, I would suggest to every clone in Star Wars.\nSuggestions\n-Turrents move their gun so they can have potential to guard you better.\n-Melee weapon, like a baton or tazer.\n-Moving turrents, like spider turrents that can jump on walls and shoot, A.I. and stuff like that.\n-More different kinds of turrents. (Rocket, poison, rats, etc.)\n-Upgrades! (Upgrading from pistol to ak47 or somethin' like that.)\n-Health packs, a certain amount per round.\n-I have not played a full round. :D\n-Option for extra prep time, for laggy people like me.\n( Probably will add more in the future. :D )","April 25","true","0.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Apparently (And this is unique to Deadweight) it likes to crash Steam every time I try to play it, and leave an impossible to end process lingering around doing nothing. When I load up Steam after the crash, apparently I am playing it. So if the game is to get me to pay £3.99 to crash Steam everytime I click the play button, then 10/10!","April 23","false","35.2"," 6 of 24 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","6","24","2","4"

Hunting you down are countless waves of cloned androids for the sadistic amusement of the robot lord, King Mechanicus. Although this game is in it's early build and needs more work, it already shows good potential, and can only get better with more updates.\n\n\n","April 30","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The physics need fixing too. If you turn around when you have a turret in your hand too quickly, it can end up on top of the partitions, which you cannot retrieve. It can be somewhat annoying.\n\nHowever the game is good and I'm loooking forward to any additions that the dev maybe adding in future.\n\n","May 15","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
