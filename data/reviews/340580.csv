I sat down at my comuter and loaded up my favorite flash game explorer site and came upon a game which I thought looked rather interesting. This was a few years ago, when I was approximately 13, so I had been playing smaller-scale games that were primarily web based. The first Armed with Wings game was the best game I had ever played at the time and I had been a follower of the Armed with Wings series since.\n\nI've played both the first and the third, not having enough time since to play the second and the alternative games. When I heard there was an Armed wtih Wings game on Steam, I had originally set my hopes rather low. I thought to myself, "Are they really putting such simple games on Steam for money? Is that what the state of the world is doing to our gaming community?" but this is well worth the price. I spent hours on end playing this game until I had every upgrade, and I still find myself loading this game up once a week and dumping an hour of my extremely busy life into it. This game definitely exceeds every single one of my expectations and is currently one of my favorite pasttimes, even though it's still fairly into development.\n\nI'm given an option to recommend this game, but honestly, I'm to the point where I just want to buy it and send it to all of my friends. Would definitely rate 5/5.","November 1, 2015","true","23.4"," 41 of 42 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","41","42","0","0"

You are given the title of Armed with Wings and extraordinary strength, sole job being to defend the world against the onset of darkness brought by Tyrant King Vandheer. Let there be light!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSShPKaJ_qs\nGameplay wise it's rather simple but aesthetically just beautiful, both artwork and soundtrack. Side-scrolling 2d platformer at it's core with some basic puzzle elements. Most of the puzzles involved use of your bird with simple timing and logic so it's certainly not a dealbreaker for people who detest them. Had strong flashbacks to Prince of Persia and similar games during my gametime.\n\nCurrently contains an endless survival mode and story with 26 levels, which can be finished in about 30minutes on normal difficulty after a few unsuccessful runs. Completing a run rewarded points for enemies killed, progression made and time taken. These points automatically unlock new upgrades for your character to further decrease the difficulty in future. Some of these included a range of weapons, increased combo counter and passive speed boosts. Did find the game a little on the easy side already, so once unlocked it really became a walk in the park which was unfortunate.\n\nMost of want I want to see added is already planned. Including new levels, characters, weapons and higher difficulty modes. Personally I think increasing the difficulty should be a priority along with adding some new attack combinations for the other buttons available, since A, A, A became a little dull. With that said it's worth at least shortlisting. Overall I enjoyed my time spent playing, just needs a little more fleshing out and that's where the community feedback comes in.

The controls are tight and easy to get used to, artwork is simply amazing and suits the game, sounds and music also slot in seamlessly, story is fairly good and easy to follow.\n\nOverall, 'Armed with Wings: Rearmed' is an amazing game that demonstrates an in-depth combat system and a few short and interesting puzzles through the story.

I always wondered how a small 30min or so flash game would fare and what kind of final product the developers could create.\n\nI gotta say, the final result exceeded my expectations.\n\nSPOILERS BELOW (Though really, the original game has been out for so long that it really doesn't matter)\n\nThe lore behind the first game and its sequels really created a lot of creative potential in expanding the idea of this game. Now that I think about, the gameplay in the original Armed With Wings was a lot less dynamic then its successors. It got to the point where I was confused at how the Lone Warrior was able to defeat Vandheer when he was so powerful in the 2nd game.\n\nThe developers have really enhanced the gameplay to include a lot of abilities which couldn't be accessed in the original game and have made battles a lot more exciting in Rearmed. The use of an EXP type system also offers a form of reward system in the form of new weapons and abilities which definitely enticed me to play the story mode more than once consecutively. This game isn't overly difficult nor hard to adapt to but some of the puzzles may be a bit confusing and fighting multiple enemies at once early in the game may pose as a challenge.\n\nThe game's survival mode has also been a lot of fun. It was difficult to get into at first but after several rounds, I was desperately holding onto that last bit of hope that I would make it to the end of every round. Definitely something to keep me occupied when I'm looking for something simple and fun.\n\nThe art and visual effects of this game are done simply but definitely done right. Though they may not seem like much on the outside, the backgrounds definitely bring the game's world to life and set the atmosphere in whichever area the player is in.\n\nAudio was very fitting for all of the levels and seemed to build the intensity of the battles quite well.\n\nOverall, this was definitely a huge step up from the original flash game which I knew and loved as a kid. Props to you Sun Studios.\n\nFor those who have played the original, I really do recommend this game. For those who haven't, it would depend on you . I will warn you, it is a very short game. I've only played for just over 2 hours but I've already unlocked all of the content and beaten the story mode three times (Mind you, it got exponentially easier each time). However, the game's survival mode will definitely make up for the current small amount of content. Also, this game will be readying up for new content in its next major update with new playable characters, weapons, abilities and missions so this is not the full game at the current stage.\n\n","June 1, 2015","true","5.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

And it is so worth the purchase. Made by a single person, this game reminds me of my childhood and it is infused with sword fighting goodness and excellent artstyle. The animation is fluid, the gameplay is smooth and the developer is active in updating the game. I highly recommend this game and it is on par with many excellent platforming games out there, if not better.

Even as an early release game.\n\nThe art is fluid and beautifully stylized. The music enhances the gameplay experience.\n\nThere are currently only 29 levels available for story mode. These feel like the first third or first act of an epic storyline.\n\nI was able to completely unlock all of the available weapons and enhancements as well as beat the existing story mode after about 4 hours of gameplay.\n\nSurvival mode is capable of some very intense combat and is a good way to increase your score to unlock weapons and enhancements.\n\nAs it is, once this game is completed and out of early release it will most likely be well worth the price tag of $ 8USD. I am hopeful that there will be another 20-70 levels for story mode. I am excited to see what other weapons and enhancements the creators put in the game.\n\nThe only problems I had were after extended time playing the game, it became sluggish and the character would freeze in a random pose when I hit various inspecific button combinations. There was no way to get the character out of this freeze without exiting the level or at worst restarting the game. I am hopeful that the RAM problems and freezes will be addressed and I look forward to the final product.","July 31, 2015","true","4.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","3"

One day, I stumbled upon the first armed with wings, it was one of the best flash games I have ever played and since then I have been an avid follower of the series. The game had an interesting premise and the story was g8 m8! Combat was engaging and fun to play around with, it was and still is a 2D great platformer with a solid soundtrack. So when the game eventually made its way to steam and got greenlit, I immediately hopped aboard. It is definitely worth its low price considering that the game is still under-development and there is still going to be more content coming out.\n\nNow on to the game itself, Armed With Wings: Rearmed is made by a single developer (D-Sun), that just speaks loads about the amount of effort that this man had to put in to make this game. It's art, soundtrack, gameplay and everything else is drawn up by one game and considering all the other games before this, there has been years and years of thinking and hardwork has been put into this one series of games.\n\nThe game is engaging, there is now a point system that has been put into the game to allow you to unlock new weapons and abilities, where you obtain said points by combo hitting enemies, this really help with keeping the combat engaging and allows less room for errors as well as making combat just simply more fun as there are multitudes of way you can whoop some ♥♥♥ and, the combat is simply smooth and fluid. The soundtrack might be simple but it just works out fine and adds to the charm of the game. The story is a continuation of the previous Armed With Wings (If you a fan). The games just exceeds all expectations and the developer is just simply great, I cannot wait to see what else that can be added to this game to make it more awesome.(As this is an early access game there are some bugs I have encountered that had me restarting the game but as of now nothing big.)  If you are a fan of the series what are you waiting for? I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a fun and intriguing 2D platformer as well.","November 7, 2015","true","3.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Often games don't get finished for one reason or another. But sometimes there is a title that catches my eye and I can't help it to give it a try. Armed with Wings is such a case. It's good side-scroller, hack 'n slash game. This is first impressions of the game.\n\nYou play as a fallen lone warrior. He awakes in a limbo like place, summoned by a god-looking figure. He is tasked with slaying the King that defeat you. I'm not too far in, but I think it's maybe just a simple revenge story.\n\nGameplay shines here. The first level is tutorial. It teaches you basics of the game, but it doesn't tell you that you have more than one basic attack.  You can actually juggle in air with the right buttons. The combat is so satisfying, part because of the tight controls, part because of the animation quality. It's not really fast paced like DMC, it's a little bit slower. The swings with the sword feel great and you have to sometimes time your attacks, because you can easily die. All my deaths are my faulth and non of them feel cheap. You have to decide to block or evade. It depends what type of enemy you encounter. I found myself using evade more often, but it wasn't always the smartest thing to do. And sometimes I was too eager to fight and this cost me a life. You have three of them. I thought at one point if a group of enemies are gathered in one place, it would be easy, but I was wrong. They wiped the floor with me. It's definitely doable if you don't rush like me. Here you don't have a jump button and at first it was weird, but once I figure out all attacks, I found the combat still really enjoyable without him.\n\nLife is restore by picking up white orbs. They can be found in different places in the level or you can just chain a few attacks and enemies will drop them. You can even use parts of the envoirment to hurt them. There are rocks on the ground and by hitting them, they will fly towards the enemies and damage them. A neat little idea.\n\nThere is slight delay between finishing a combo and start new one. I'm not sure if I like it. It's probably intentional to have some sort vulnerability to keep you on your toes.\n\nExept the story you can find survival mode, but I was not prepared enough for it. After wave three I died within few seconds.\n\nWhen you slay enemies, you get points and after you quit or loose all your lives, all of them goes to the unlockables. They are linear, you can't put the wherever you want. They can be sword or a booster. Through my time with the game I unlock three swords with different stats and one booster. From here and the timer on top of the screen comes the replayability. There are leaderboards and a lot of things to unlock, so you can get better and more powerful.\n\nThe level design is basic, but there are sometimes different paths to take. Some may even lead you to skip a level and get more points. There are some puzzles here, but they are easy. All include an eagle that follows you around. With him you can also gather healing orbs or distract enemy. All levels are fairly short. I'm not that further into the game, so I can't comment for all of them. I beaten half of the levels and they are total of 30 for now.\n\nThe sound design is nice. All moves have great sounds effects, but the music is lacking variety. I only heard two songs – one through the levels, the other was for the first boss battle. They both are really great, but few more would be nice. The track that I heard most is really enchanting. It immerse me into this dark world. Yet simple, but effective to me.\n\nGraphics is what caught my attention at first. When I saw the trailer my first thought was “Samurai Jack in black and white”. I love the simple graphic art style, it's especially suitable for the the tone that tries to achive and it succeed. If there was a single other colour, it won't be the same. And also I mention in the beginning the quality of the animation. It is awesome!\n\nWhat I saw is really great for an early acces title. It have tons of potential to be more than just great. There are a lot of things to be added – new character, new booster, new swords and new levels. There will be replayability, without being a rogue-lite. When you die, you can start from the beginning or choose a level. What I like to see further into development is more resolution options, few more track and combos maybe, rebindble keys not only for keyboard, but also for controller. I try both methods, but controller is more fun. Since I don't have Xbox 360 controller (which by the way is supported), I had to use third party software. It's promising title, not very expensive and updates come fairly frequently. Just because it's in Early Access my advise is to wait and see how much content there will be. But if you decide to support the developer, it would be great. It have content, but in my opinion it's not worth the full price for now. I'll follow the game and if it comes out of Early Access I will beat it and update my review.","January 3","true","1.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It is a personal favorite of mine, flashgames wise. So, when I saw this on Steam, I was beyond excited. Finally, a paid for Armed With Wings, which could only mean that the game will be fantastic. I have always said to myself that if I ever had the money, I would try and donate to the person who created this game series. And now I can support him. So if I seem a bit biased in this review, then I do apologise. Now let us begin the review.\n\nOkay, first things first, the art style. The art style is minimalistic, only being black, white and various shades of grey. This has been the art style of the game series since the first one, and it has always been amazing.\n\nSecondly, gameplay. Very fluid movements, very nicely animated, and overall, very satisfying to control. There is a light, speedy attack and a single hit heavy dashing attack. You can change the direction you attack by holding up or down, which is very useful for pulling off combos. Now, levels are different than the previous games, and this can be a good or bad thing. Whenever you start the game and play, you have to play through all the way until you either die, or beat the last level. As of writing this review all the levels are not available, but what levels there are are varied, and themed differently. It has a sort of platforming style of gameplay, but the platforming is relatively limited and there really is no jump button. You tend to solve puzzles in the level with your eagle, because you're "armed with wings." The eagle cannot attack, but it can pick up things to help you progress. Overall, I'd give the gameplay itself a 8/10, if only because I know not everyone likes the kind of game it is.\n\nNext, is story. Actually, I'm not going to give story spoilers, because you can get most of the story from the first Armed with Wings game which is relatively cheap. It tends to go for the low, low price of free, and can be found on Newgrounds. Basically, play the other games first, they're amazing.\n\nSoundtrack. Love me a good soundtrack. And you know what this game has? A really good soundtrack. Most of the music fits all of the areas really well, and is wonderfully composed. That is pretty much all I got for music. It's really good.\n\nFinally, glitches. There really aren't a whole lot of bugs and glitches(from what I've seen). The only real issue I've found is if you go high enough over an area, you can skip certain events. Those are pretty much all the bugs I found, and it will probably be fixed in the near future.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a wonderful game, and played my nostalgia like a fiddle. Of course, I did try and be really critical about this game, but Sun-Studios did too good a job when creating it that I essentially had to nitpick to find stuff wrong with it.\n\nTL;DR: It's a fantastic game, and you should at least try out the original flash games.","January 28","true","11.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

How wrong I was!\n\nNow, as this is an Early Access game at the moment of this review, that means this isn't the full product. But while the game is short for now, the experience of playing even as it is is just wonderful. Pretty slick cinematics, fluid animations, buttery smooth combat, the minimalistic yet stylized graphics, I could go on. The soundtrack is very atmospheric, even if there isn't much variance yet. It makes me beyond excited to read the discussions & know just what the developer, D-Sun, has planned content-wise.\n\nWhile this is a 2D platformer with plenty of combat, there are also puzzle segments that honestly feel just right, neither painfully easy nor painfully difficult. I've played the 29 levels offered so far multiple times (also dying many times before I really got the hang of things -- to me, this can be a learn-as-you-go kind of game) & I still haven't felt annoyed with any of the mechanics or the pacing of the levels. & can I just say? The leaping mechanic? Freakin' adore that too.\n\nI definitely agree with the reviewer before me that I feel like sharing this game with as many of my friends as possible. I absolutely recommend it!\n\n(P.S.

The visual portion of the game definitely stands out and has really good animation, and I like the themes that the game is playing with. The combat needs work, it's rather straight forward and with the amount of combat it asks of you, it needs more to really make it stand out. Will be interested to see what they do with it going forward, that's for sure. With most early access titles, if you want to be involved in the process, I would say this has enough potential to take a look at it, but it always comes with a buyer beware warning as there's no guarentee you will get what the game promises. This review will be revisited when it comes out of early access.\n\n+:\nLove the use of color and the animations. Things stick out appropriately and does feel rather nice to look at over time.\nI like the initial setup for the story, and will be interested to see where it goes.\nI've gone back and forth on this point, but the fact that it's got something unique in the redo of the lives system, similar to hard games of old, is different and will be interesting to see how it plays out. Good element of progression is added so that you're more prepared the next time around.\nUnlike other early access games, didn't run into any bugs during play session (major ones at least), which is a nice change of pace (and it's sad this is a positive, but it is given the current state of affairs).\nIt's actually sorta refreshing to see a game not force a jump mechanic in there. -:\nCombat is rather basic and needs more refinement in order to carry the game longterm.\nPuzzles are really just sorta there, they more delay things then anything else and don't take a lot of thought to do them. If that was intentional, it feels like an unnecessary waste.\nLevel and Level progression is weird. Some levels are over rather quickly (including one that I have no idea what it's purpose is, and I'm not talking about the first one), and it feels uneasy on some of them. With it being early access, it's hard to tell what parts of levels are to be “filled in” and what ones aren't, even though there's obvious work done.\nThe repetitive nature of redoing the levels with the lives system will mean redoing levels over and over again, which will wear on the user.\nLevel design issues regarding enemy placement at times.  A lack of a jump (which is still a positive) means that there's little control once you move off a ledge, taking precious damage at times that you can't afford.\nAgain, like many early access games, is missing elements of tutorial that are important to teach the user. In particular, teaching block and what seems to be a counter is important in a game with limited health/lives, so that needs to be one of the first things focused on.\nFor some gameplay footage and information for the dev: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpNmXIlXjLg","May 28, 2015","true","1.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

It is more than worth the price, and I really want to see this developer get bigger.\n\nBecause of the music, minimalistic feel, and fancy desintigration death animations, it kind of brings tron to mind, and that's good in my book. The artwork is good, the music is GREAT.\nThe control scheme is fairly simple, arrows move your character, WASD controls your actions, this is about as ergonomic as you can get, as long as you have a decent keyboard. (I think your can switch the keys around). A does a quick, weak attack, S does a nifty array of power attacks, and D is used to block and dodge (old fashioned dodge, nothing like Assassin's creed or Batman), W is used for some kind of super attack, but I havn't used that yet.\nThe fight mechanics feel pretty good, although a bit un-polished. (I've only had about 2 hours of play so far, my opinion may change as I get used to the controls.) Combat is pretty brutal at times, and anybody who has played AWW: Culmination online can liken the new skulls in this game to those flying pain-in-the-tooths from Culmination.\nThe story is superlight, but its not really a drawback to the over all experience.","December 24, 2015","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I figured that they would be easy to find, what with the likes of Ronin and Mark of the Ninja becoming so popular. However, there only was one other sidescrolling REALTIME katana'em'up game on the market as of my purchase of AwW:Rearmed. The reviews of the other game scared me off, so I got this one instead.\n\nI was initially drawn to the black and white art style, and the look of the main character. However I plan to stay because of the genuine challenge of the game. Each new enemy takes thought to learn how to beat, and facing groups of enimes is quite difficult at times. On top of that, bosses are thrown into the mix (although the first one is currently pretty easy to cheese with the jump attack.)\n\nThe game never gets super easy, but it is never so unapproachable that you have to quit it for a while (a la dark souls). I believe I will keep coming back to it again and again.

The art style is just clean and sharp. Makes a big difference when going for a strong play without any color and I think they pull it off well.\n\nIt’s a pretty straight forward hack and slash gameplay, with some intriguing puzzle elements and many weapon choices. You may think the eagle that follows you is just for aesthetics, you’d be wrong. With a simple button push you can control your feathered friend to pick up items, open doors, and help you on your way to solve puzzles and destroy you enemy.\n\nEverything works well and as I said the art style is great.

Naturally you disagree with them about this, so you hit them with the sword until they turn into smoke. Normal action platformer stuff. There's no jump button, but you auto-jump off ledges like OOT. You can switch to the bird and fly around to solve simple puzzles. There are a few "hidden" moves (or else there's instructions somewhere that I didn't read) that you can pull off, but mostly this is a straightforward run and stab kind of thing. The battles are a little bit strategic. You can block and dodge or use one of a handful of attacks.\n\nBasically just watch the video and see if it interests you. It may not be for everyone, but it's pretty solid for an initial EAG release.","May 28, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

I'm a person that typically doesn't enjoy platformer type games, but this game does platforming in a non-frustrating way. The unlocks feel rewarding and worthwhile. The art style is magnificent. Also this game will definitely be great for people interested in Speed Running. I immediately knew that it would be perfect. Overall, this game is totally worth a try.

The combat is fluent and enjoyable, I've spent a lot of time just going to levels and juggling monsters around. The art style is absolutlely beautiful, every animation flows about as well as an artist's paint stroke, and the story, although a bit simple. is still incredibly enjoyable.\n\nEasily the best early access game I've ever had the pleasure to play.","May 5","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Got it in a bundle for 2.49.  Don't think they should be charging 7.99 USD for it.  4.99 USD and under is what I think they should be targeting.\n\nDespite the pricing quarrels the game is solid.  I'm waiting on the final boss I think.  Short game but a solid 1-4 hours of fun depending on your learning curve.\n\n4/5 on a gamer scale.  (Combat targets an older generation) Combo juggles like Valdis Story)  So much potential in the combat system.\n\n2/5 on a content scale.

The only drawback is, after you have the most powerful weapon things get boring and beating the game became soooo easy.\n\nI think the best one of the AWW series is Culmination, though its weapon and level system is not as much as Rearmed, the combo system and power strike variation really made it stand out. I have played Culmination for more than 100 times and really enjoyed its elegant combo. For Rearmed, after getting the final sword, any enemy could be killed simply by normal 4-combo attack. So I got bored after beating it for about 4 or 5 times.\n\nDaniel if you could see this comment, I wish there could be more attacking methods available in the game (like power slash variation, jumping, etc) rather than more weapons. My suggestion would be, weaken the attack of high leveled weapons, but make it possible to give more diversified attacks with them. So even if you get the final weapon, the enemies would not be toooooo easy to be beaten, but you could get more fun in killing them with different combos :)\n\nAfter all, thank you Daniel for making such a fascinating game! Looking forward to the update.","December 17, 2015","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
