"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linusolsson/recommended/434570/","linusolsson","Z0mBi3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linusolsson/","2548 products in account","This is a simple, silly little game that I picked up late friday night, just to play something while I watched some videos on my other monitor. I picked this game since its fast to download (300mb) , looked like a game that I could easily get into and the price is almost nothing.\n\nThe graphics are old-looking, but in my opinion kinda charming. The ak-47 looks like something taken out of the counter strike 1.6 era, but the game plays like a fast-paced, crazy FPS, serious sam/shadow warrior sort of game. The graphics was obviously made this was to be more of a humorous type of game.\n\nThe story doesn't make much sense and the voice-acting is pretty bad, but who cares. This is a game mostly focused on silly gameplay where you murder hordes of monsters and animals for a while. This game actually had more depth then I expected for the price, lots of characters to pick between, some sort of upgrade system, new unlockable levels, cheat mode enabled once you clear 30 waves, and so on.\n\nI think the psysics are fun and satisfying in this game. Monster splatter to pieces when you shot them up with a shotgun, and I also tried out a revolver and what looked like a desert eagle pistol. There is some bugs and glitches here and there, but I got some laughs out of this little game anyway. Includes steam trading cards as well, so you can actually make your money back, or close to, by just selling the cards. Also achievements, stats and controller support for those that like that.\n\nIf you just want a little bit of fun alone or with friends ( yes, it has co-op) then by all means pick this up. Just don't expect to much in terms of graphics or story. Blood and bacon does have 100+ levels though, so gameplay-wise it actually have a lot of content for the asking price.\n\nI say like Macklemore, "but sh*t, it was 99 cents...

Blood and Bacon showed up on there in 2013 and although there are no noticeable changes in its jump to PC, this isn't really the kind of game you'll need an HD remaster to enjoy/despise.\n\nMake no mistake, Blood and Bacon is a shoddy game; the giant zombified pigs that you must spend each in-game day murdering range from acting suspiciously disinterested at you shooting them in the face to balls-out enraged, charging through solid surfaces and straight over the tops of buildings to crush you. It's an ugly, glitchy mess but it is also deeply entrenched enough in its madness to work.\n\nInstructions are given to you by a farmer in a pitchless monotone, pinned to the barn wall by his own pitchfork, his eyes bulging and manic. You grow to look forward to Revenge Day, a weekly celebration of your survival where all of your guns are loaded up with explosive ammo and firing an AK-47 into a rampage of swine looks like a half ton of fireworks going off in a medical waste bin. Enormous pigs drop by once every ten days for an epic boss battle. There's a last stand mode.\n\nI don't think I ever finished it the first time around; over a hundred levels of this madness is more than my delicate psychological balance can take quite frankly but you should easily grind some enjoyment out of it for the meagre asking price.\n\nI'll take you through to the first boss in the video below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKXdbl7FZSM","February 1","true","0.6"," 47 of 66 people (71%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","71","47","66","20","12"

It's completely basic, pick up and play, fast paced shooter goodness with a lite story to keep you moving forward. Mostly though, it's all about pig carnage....pigs, demonic pigs, undead pigs, tiny fast little ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• pigs, gargantuan ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off boss pigs, etc....\n\nAs you progress through to new days, new weapons will unlock, and there is also a meat grinder, which when filled with pig body parts and shot in the right spot, will churn out ammo and disposable weapons during battles. The grinder also sees upgrades as you progress. There is also an electric fence that can make short work of your enemies who are standing near it.\n\nYou are encouraged, berated, and generally bossed around by the farmer, who is impaled on a wall in the barn with a missing leg that was clearly torn off, as there is bone sticking out, lol. He is pretty funny and also can be a total ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, but sometimes it's your own fault (since you will inevitably feel the urge to shoot him, shine your flashlight in his face, and otherwise mess with him). Basically, he represents the start of a new level (day) before and after each battle.\n\nThere is also in battle healing, via water pumps located around the farm. I've also gotten a carton of milk which allows you to jump super high.\n\n....and that is basically it. Lots of pig blood and bullets.\n\nYou should probably buy this.","February 13","true","1.9"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","28","36","4","2"

Exploding pigs in blood fountains are next to harmless playing music and butterflies flying around. There are several types of pigs like boars, zombie pigs, skeleton pigs and even robo-pigs.

The start screen is very basic, but it's very well done. It's easy to find the graphic settings, the controls, the co-op, and single player buttons, not to mention the audio itself.\n\nGetting into the actual gameplay, It's amazing. Although the farmer is very annoying, but for what you pay for the game it is really good. The guns are really good, and powerful at low rounds, and as you progress it gets harder to kill the boars. Getting into the days, I think 101 days is a little bit long to play, but if you have the time it's fun, and the characters themselves are great to play as.\n\nThe bosses get harder every 10 days which is really challenging and fun. I love the aspect that they can heal so that they don't die so easily, and you have to actually do a lot of hard work to kill them, but the best part of the bosses is the names for the fat pig that's in the middle.\n\nGetting on to the grinder. The grinder is amazing, but it is used for powerups which is also a great addition to the game, and make sit much better to play for something else other than just killing boars that are on steroids, but apart from that stuff that's all there is to the grinder.\n\nGetting on the farmer himself. He is funny, but also annoying. His jokes aren't that great, and could be worked on a little bit, but apart from that the farmer is a great guy. Especially when you shoot him, and he starts getting mad, and eventually throws stuff at you.\n\nGetting on the boars. There is a mix of boar's from small to large, and from skeletons, to bosses, and from boar's to pigs. The game on a whole is amazing, and I love it.\n\nGetting on to the price. The price of the game should be more, because of how fun the game is especially when you play with friends, and have a laugh with them. So I recommend the price should be set atleast at ¬£2.50, and not 0.75. I'm not complaining about it being so cheap, but I think it should be more.\n\nOn a whole I would recommend anyone to get this game that enjoys shooter genres, and loves to play co-op with friends.\n\nI would rate this game a 10/10, and that you should buy it if you have a spare ¬£0.79\n\nP.S.

Guns? Check. Blood? Check. Massive pigs to slaughter? Check. Revenge days that give you unlimited EXPLOSIVE ammo? Freakin' check! This is a cheap FPS experience that you will not want to take a pass on.\n\nThe game itself looks no better than a second-rate Playstation 2 title. It doesn't even sound much better, either, but who gives a crap about all of that when you're having so much fun? The premise of the game is simple; a one-legged farmer, that looks strangely like Hank Hill, has had his farm overrun by irate piggies with an insatiable blood-lust. The game progresses in terms of "days", and every 10 days you will face a new mini-boss or regular boss pig. There are also revenge days every week, where the farmer equips you with unlimited explosive ammo so that you can blow the pigs to kingdom come!\n\nThere's only one map, the farm, and a total of eight main guns and pistols to choose from. It would be nice to see at least a couple more maps and guns added to the title's arsenal, but the game doesn't see itself become boring for quite a while. The sound effects are cheap, the music is repetitive, and all of the voice acting is done by one person. The voice overs are so cheap that they're hilarious. The game is also well made, there are no framerate issues or crashes, at least in my experience.\n\nAt this point I can't seem to get past Princess, a massive pooping and vomiting boss on day 20, but I've had tons of fun getting there. I'd be lying if I said that this game wasn't worth a buck, I kinda feel like the developer is underselling Blood and Bacon. I don't know why you're wasting your time reading this review when you could be slaughtering bacon right now, so just go ahead and put down that $1.00 and get to wreckin' piggies!\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","February 4","true","1.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","9"

It's been less than a week since the pig-tastic Iron Snout found its way onto Steam, and now we have more bloodthirsty porcine madness in the form of Blood and Bacon.  My opinion of this game?  It's quite simply one of the dumbest, yet funnest, games you're ever liable to play.  Yeah, it's stoopid.  Stoopid and bloody and gross.  And sure the graphics aren't exactly "next-gen".  But if you're looking for something silly to satisfy the Serious Sam in you, this game will do just the trick.  All this, and it's only a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING DOLLAR!\n\nLet me put it some other ways.  Have you ever felt like being vomited and projectile-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• upon by a gigantic pig called Princess Blubbergut?  Yeah, me neither, but turns out it's actually pretty fun.  Ever wanted a game where shooting enemies not only in the face but in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• does more damage than standard shots?  Yup, you get the idea.  All this, and missions handed out by a farmer pinned to a barn wall by a pitchfork, who somehow never seems to die for weeks on end.  You can even shoot him repeatedly in the face for an achievement!\n\nIn short, almost everything about this game is pretty hilarious:  The gore, the achievements, the farmer's dialogue, the voice acting.  This game basically achieves everything it sets out to achieve, and that's a rare thing these days, even when a game's ambitions aren't incredibly high.  My only complaint is that it was initially a bit of a trick to get the thing to go full-screen and to work out some of the keys - it was designed more for X-Box and a controller - but hopefully the dev will sort that stuff out soon.  Entertaining, unpretentious, and dirt-cheap.  If only more "Big Corporation"s behaved this way!\n\nVerdict: 8/10.","February 1","true","11.0"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","14","19","4","1"

When I looked at the screenshots and an 'overwhelmingly positive' rating of this game, I thought it was one of those where people give it a 'thumbs up' because it's so bad it's either good or everyone is making a joke about it.\n\nBut not Blood and Bacon. It looks poor (on screenshots) and it's not a graphical marvel in the game, nor does it have amazing music or sound effects. But when you pair up with a friend, it's an absolute blast.\n\nThe main objective is to kill and destroy evil pig demon creature things, whatever they are. Protecting the farm is paramount as is your own life. Remember how I said the graphics aren't state of the art? While that is true and everything is a bit more basic (think Half-Life 1 era), the dismemberment and blood effects on the pigs are surprisingly good looking and fun. In fact, sometimes taking off a pig's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• or head will expose its spine for you to shoot at and do extra damage.\n\nAs you finish each level (or day), you will sometimes get new weapons in the barn, which acts as your base (and houses the eternally-impaled farmer which gives you advice and spurs you on). There's no buying or upgrading per se, but you can get the farm's bizarre grinder to start up by feeding it chunks of dead pigs, then use its charged up state to manufacture more ammunition, grenades, milk (health packs) and so on.\n\nEvery now and then, you will have a night defence, which brings out the more nasty kinds of the creatures. I'm not going to spoil it for you but it's fun. There's also bosses which will taunt you, munch at you and kick you. They're bullet sponges but that's okay because they're a lot of fun to fight. Playing with a friend will allow one to try and get its attention while the other one runs over to one of the water pumps to heal up (albeit slowly).\n\nI mean... This is one of the bigger (pleasant) surprises in the past year for me. Don't judge the game by its screenshots and DO make sure to get one for yourself and a friend so you can play together!\n\nFor 1$, you can't go wrong here.

There's really no way around it as you'll be doing mostly the same thing for most waves (that is, shooting purcines until they die/ gib/ explode while trying not to be gored to death): some variety can come from armored enemies that you must shoot in the back or bosses that require a bit of strategy but that's all.Said repetitiveness is also made stronger by the overall lack of different enemy models and the fact you'll be seeing the same two bosses types over and over every ten days with- at most- only slight changes in how they work.\n\nAs for what it does right well, the game is extremely easy to pick up and play and the fact each day is so short means you can give it a quick go even if you have little time. The toilet humor can be funny at times- if you're ok with that brand of humor ofc- and the huge amount of gibs/ blood on screen is as amusing as it is satisfying to see after you've managed to clear a particularly hard day. While basic the gameplay can also be quite challenging especially when playing solo as certain enemies can kill you in a few hits if you let them get too close: same goes for bosses as they'll require a good amount of concentration to succeed.\n\nFor me Blood and Bacon was a fun yet slightly dull and somewhat forgettable experience, an one trick pony if you wish: but for a dollar I feel I got enough enjoyment from it to justify its purchase hence my thumbs up. As for you well, it's quite decent if you're looking for something silly to play in short bursts, even more so with a friend.","March 29","true","4.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

And my god you need to hold on for that thought, because, it really is. Now, this can mean alot of things, but it mostly means, that although this games textures isn't Crysis 3 level, i'd say for the 0,99¬£ you pay, this might be the god danm best game ever made.\n\nAbout the experience:\nThe content/idea of the game, is halarious, and although alot of people would call it stupid, i strongly disagree. It's a very anti-stress simulator, and once you get into it, it get's really cathchy, as in you start to try hard, to keep up with the levels. Also, the fact that they put a cheat menu, in the game, is really awesome, although, it unlocks at level 30, which is kinda fair enough, so that people can get an actual feel for the game before jumping into the easy peasy mode.\nI really liked, the weapon progression aswell, as it gives you something to strive for, while fighting through the endless waves of piggs. The boss fights is alot of fun as well, although, it took me some time to figure out, how to beat them. And the reason for that, is, everybody is busy judging the game, before you really get started, and this caused me to think, that there was no need for tacts. Boy was i wrong, and i wont explain how i beat the boss, for the sake of other people's spoiler affection.\n\nSome downsites:\nSome of the controls are a bit strange and i could have guessed that the game was meant to be played with a controller, which gave alot of confusion.\nAnother thing, was the key bindings, for PC, which sounds alot like the same complain, as my previous one. but really think it should be mention in a section for it self.\nAnother downsite is it has a tendensy to crash, sometimes, which would follow up on the fact that it would give you, the feeling that you wanted to stop trying.\n\n\nAnd overall gameplay impression and rating, i'd say i would give it a 6,7/10 for what i've played, and i think that the developer really got some potential, to do some bigger and better games. Hope to see more from this, relative unknown devoloper in the future.\n\n-Amorth","February 9","true","4.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","3"

Had a wonderful time farming the **** out of those pigs! Seriously, the game is really fun. The controls are responsive, simple and keys can now be remapped! The enemies are various, their speed and health will change depending on the wave and sometimes they can be really challenging! Since I'm a huge fps fan, i only played it from the first person view, but you can play from a third person view and from top down! The field of view is also editable on the spot, so everybody can enjoy the game without headache. Also, the devs are incredibly supportful, they even contacted me directly when I had trouble with my mouse movements (wich is now fixed). The game also contains several power ups, which lets you try different play styles. I played the game on normal, and it was fairly easy to get through. If you ever find it too easy, try the hard mode. At this point, I don't even know if it's possible. Other than that, the only thing you might want to know is that in order to achieve perfect mouse movements, you need to disable v-sync via your graphic card control panel and that's all!\nFor further development, I expect more guns and multiplayer. This game used to be a xbox indie game and it had multiplayer so why not in steam? The only things that i found sad about the game is that the gunfire sounds are funny and that the gun models are, let's say... erm... neglected. Also, the bosses are,*erh*, bulletsponges. But other than that, this game is very solid. Oh, almost forgot to talk about the farmer and the humor... This game is really funny, and the farmer plays a big role in that. He is constantly telling awful jokes that are so bad that it makes them funny. And some bosses are... hmm... special.\n\nTL:DR (Resume)\n\nPros:\n-Really good controls and gameplay\n-Ultra supporting devs\n-Funny\n-Pretty long for the price\n-Challenging\n-The way pigs blow up when shot in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•\n\nCons:\n-Bullet sponge bosses\n-poor gun modeling and sounds\n-Not named *American Freedom Farming Simulator*\n\nNow stop reading and go get this game, silly you!","February 15","true","8.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It is hilarious. I did not expect much from it, but for this price it is more than worth. The game is worth more, than it's price actually. If you want to shut off your brain for a time, then this game is for you. Complete madness in a good way. It needs some polish (able to map more mouse buttons or a new game option for the feeling of progression and unlocking things), but it is already a good game. This is why I support indie titles. They are the future of gaming. Remember, when games tried to be more innovative with their settings or gameplay? Yeah it was a long time ago. Indie games are the future of gaming. Mostly only they stand out with some unique gameplay or ideas. This game can also be great instead of good, with time if they make the co-op part and later maybe they can add another story mode(s) (more farms? :D), or more enemy types, new weapons.\n","February 15","true","9.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There is also a meat grinding mechanic where you can exchange the bits of the dead pigs for bonuses like ammo for your main gun, grenades and a couple of other powerups.\n\nWhile the gameplay itself is sadly not much remarkable, the absurdist elements and humor of the game is what really sets it apart, and it's what's going to really carry to game or not for you.\n\nOne other major flaw of the game is that it really overstays its welcome in the ending levels. If you make it to day 20 and you either start to get bored or weren't hooked to it yet, you'll be justified in leaving.\n\nOverall, it's a quirky game that's very wekk worth its admission price if you are looking for an arena shooter.","March 22","true","8.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There's a variety of crazy characters to choose from; the roster is going up with them, as well as weapons, and craftable powerups. Power ups can be made by using A Machine For Pigs (meat grinder) if you'll pardon the bad pun; you make stuff by kicking pig parts into it.\n\nThis is also a survival game if you haven't guessed; it is a welcome twist on the genre to add humor. The most you could be terrified is when facing either the hordes of undead pigs, or bosses in the dark, with a flashlight. It's all good fun, but messy. :)\n\nPlus, it's possible to reload while running, and they just recently added fov settings among other things.\n\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed it, but if you have a problem with the porcine slaughter of thousands not so innocent pigs then this is not the game for you.","February 9","true","15.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Day and night levels, players will take on 35 enemy types and numerous bosses, like the gargantuan monster affectionately named, ‚ÄòPrincess Blubbergut‚Äô and Minibosses every 10 days as you explore, shoot and run for your life against the onslaught of porcine monstrosities. The game creatively dispenses pickups through a meat grinder, from the very creatures you are killing. Ammo boxes, Adrenaline, Grenades, Rockets, and other exotic boosters. Boasting over 30 hours of gameplay and the ability to battle a staggering (or shambling) 500+ undead creatures at once, "Blood and Bacon" looks to feature more barnyard excitement than you can shake Old MacDonald‚Äôs severed femur at !! - Recommended!","February 7","true","1.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

Overtime, you will unlock several unique weapons and acquire comical powerups from a functional pig grinder on the farm. Although it seems straightforward at first, the variety in the games levels will always be a challenge; just as you set into a rhythm, the game throws several new enemy types upon you, forcing you to stay on your toes. The pig types include armored pigs, super fast pigs, tiny pigs, huge pigs, skeletal pigs, princess pigs, pigs that run in herds, pigs that can grow in size, and many other types that can be tricky to deal with when first encountered. Each of the game's weapons, from an uzi to a missile launcher, feel powerful and satisfying to play with. At its low price, there are very very few games on any platform that can match Blood and Bacon in value, fun, and comedy. I have gotten more entertainment out of this game than games that cost 60 times its value, and I highly recommend it as a casual shooter to play through.","March 18","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I love the fact that there are different types of pigs and that the bosses are quite difficult.\n\nOverall I would rate this game 9/10 and the only reason i gave it a nine is because i feel like the pigs could be a bit harder to kill and that you would get a new weapon every 10 days and not 4 or 5.

The idea of the game is so far fetched that it works. I love the fact that there are different types of pigs and that the bosses are quite difficult.\n\nOverall I would rate this game 9/10 and the only reason i gave it a nine is because i feel like the pigs could be a bit harder to kill and that you would get a new weapon every 10 days and not 4 or 5.

No. There's not a whole lot of content, and it gets repetitive pretty quickly.\n\nIs this game worth buying? Yes. You will get a couple hours of fun for $1. Could get even more time on it if you get a friend to play it with you.\n\nWhy? The game is a mindless shooter, so you can go ahead and shoot like crazy at all the boars that are chasing you. Graphics are like a mediocre version of Postal 2, there's 1 level,  a few different boar types, 2 different bosses, 6 primary  and 4 secondary weapons, 100 couple minute days to get to the 'ending', and a guy that repeats a set of comments and cheap puns. Again, this is fun for a bit, which makes it worth the $1.\n\nRating purely based on quality: 4/10\nRating based on quality for price: 7/10\n\n(This is my opinion, by the way.

Could get even more time on it if you get a friend to play it with you.\n\nWhy? The game is a mindless shooter, so you can go ahead and shoot like crazy at all the boars that are chasing you. Graphics are like a mediocre version of Postal 2, there's 1 level,  a few different boar types, 2 different bosses, 6 primary  and 4 secondary weapons, 100 couple minute days to get to the 'ending', and a guy that repeats a set of comments and cheap puns. Again, this is fun for a bit, which makes it worth the $1.\n\nRating purely based on quality: 4/10\nRating based on quality for price: 7/10\n\n(This is my opinion, by the way.

Graphics are look dated but are passable if you are someone that doesn't care about the way the game looks. Anyone that has Played old Valve games (such as Counter Strike Left 4 Dead 1 or Half Life 1) will somewhat feel right at home. This game looks like the Dollar it is worth. The shooting is really good but nothing really new. Guns are somewhat transparent but I am pretty sure the guys wanted it to look that way.\n\nThe few bad things about this game are that the Electrical fence is pretty much useless. The Meat Grinder is a way for you to get Ammo, Grenades, exc. The way to go about this is to kill most of the pigs near the machiene and shoot some of the chunks of meat into the Grinder to get the Machiene started and most of the chunks will start to flow in and the more chunks go in the more rewards you are able to get. But Their is no way you will be able to collect while their are still enemies alive becauset they Knock you all around to where you can barily shoot with acuracy. The times it is Nighttime is really not all that different to the Daytime only black sky and the colors are dimmed down a little.\n\nNow this isnt a game that you will be skipping your Homework to play. It's a game that you will play if you have twenty or thirdy minutes to pass and you have nothing else to play. It could be more enjoyable if you have a friend with a copy but I have no friends with a copy of the game so I couldn't see for myself. I cant really see myself recommending it to anyone since Left 4 Dead 2 exist and i can't really see me playing this daily or weekly. But it is worth the Dollar its worth so if you have one dollar to spare and Thirdy minutes to kill then start slaudering.","June 2","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The game definitely feels like a finished product now - so this is my new updated review of this neat little indie game.\n\nThe good stuff....\n\n- Fast paced and simple. Shoot everything that moves! There are some tactical stuff you can mess around with when you get further in to the game.\n- Ultra realism, go f@ck yourself ARMA.\n- Tight controls.\n- The "style and humor" of the game is great.\n\nThe bad stuff....\n\n- Graphics need a overhaul, the pigs are blocky and look like ... I don't even know what. Better visuals = better immersion.\n- The level design need a little overhaul also. There are plenty of invisible walls you just can't pass through, why?\n\nFinal verdict....\n\n7/10 - A nice little indie game.

Overall, the graphics aren't too bad if you don't mind them not being AAA quality, and the gameplay is pretty fast paced, since it goes from one level to the next rather quickly. I was playing by myself, but I would bet thie game would be better with someone else playing with you. My only real complaint is the voice acting and sound quality of that acting is terrible. However, it really doesn't take anything away from the game as it is only in short bits and for a limited amount of time. In the end, I enjoyed playing it, and it is a fun, casual shooter to kill time and have a few laughs slaughtering zompigs.","February 2","true","1.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mc_jp/recommended/434570/","mc_jp","|-MC_JP-|THE LEGACY OF TERROR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mc_jp/","169 products in account","Before I start I wanna say big thanks to the developer "BigCorporation" for taking 2 hours of his personall time in order to fully get the game working for me. A great step by step plan to figure out what was wrong and he knows what he is doing! The developer is a friendly person who cares about his game and it's players!\n\nso now my sort of In depth review of Blood and bacon.\n\nWhere do I start? You play as a own chosen character who needs to survive in a farm attacked by evil piggies. Lucky the character isn't named "angry bird" haha! Jokes aside this game is just straight fun and stress relieving.  The game is an arena shooter that puts you against various pigs or better boars. Tiny, normal, big, undead, bones etc.\n-Weapons-\nThe game has 4 Handguns and 7 main weapons. Ranging from Ak's and Uzis to pistols and grenade launchers. Power ups are present like hand grenades and melee boosters.\n-Area-\nAs stated the game sets place on a "deserted" farm, well deserted is a big word since waves and waves of bacon ready yummy pigs are coming your way and the farmer which is impaled with a pitchfork. He adds a great humor to the game aswell. The farm has a few interesting spots. The grinder allows you to dump the corpses in the bacon o fier and this will give you handy pickups later in the game. The electric fence gives a great killzone in the middle of the map, the farmhouse is the place for weapons and missions, and you can heal with a waterwell.\n-special events-\nIngame: every week has 1 revenge day. This day gives you infinite explosive ammo, ideal for filling the grinder. On the 10th day there will be a boss fight, with various funny bosses.\nNight battles are scary because of the limited light you have. Adding into the suspense.\n\nEvery mission is a day and can last from 30 seconds to 10 minutes or more (mostly boss battles do take some time) So this is a great short take a break game.\n\nPros:\n+ Great stress relieving shoot-em up area shooter\n+ Handy for playing in short breaks (lunch break, or a little stress reliever trough the day)\n+ Cheaper than a pack of chewing gum\n+ The developer is a great person who took 2 hours of his personal time to aid me in my problem. Running through all the scenarios and fixing the problem we had.\n+ Shoot pigs ask questions later\n+ Environmental attacks adds into the imersion\n+ Great oldschool simple shoot em up game.\nCons:\n- Sadly no multiplayer yet. Would have been awesome\n- Could be a bit repetitive for some people because of limited content (please do note that this is a 99 cent game and not a 60$ huge budget title)\n\nOverall score: 8/10.\n\n---original notes----\nReworked my review after the developer contacted me. After working all night to get the problem fixed I must say the dev is working hard to help everyone. And besides, I love this slaughter game. So thumbs up!","February 16","true","5.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

Surely it has it's pacing issues and shooting mechanics aren't that great. But it nails it's trash genre aesthetics really well - it's hilarious, it's disgusting, it's gory, it's sadistic. You'll remember the first time you gib your hands off, or the first time your blow Princess' a** off (protip: it won't stop her from s**tting on you). Just like the greatest examples of trash genre it walks on thin line between being hilarious and disgusting and manages to keep being fun all the time. Yeap, there is no any multiplayer in PC version, sadly. But devs update the game pretty often despite it's release state and polish the experience better than most early access titles can offer.\nHey, I live my games as experience, so sorry if review got fuzzy. I'm just trying to say that Blood and Bacon is an experience, and one of a kind. And it's damn fun.\nYou see it's price? Buy it. Buy it for your esthete friends too.

It's has bad jokes, excessive gore, as well as a solid and entertaining gameplay loop. It's just self-indulgent rediculous fun to blow up pigs with automatic weapons of all things.

Don't worry this updated review is going the be spoiler free.\n\nI got this game after seeing not only the video, the price, but also the number of positive reviews.\nAfter playing it for a short time I became hooked. I just had to play this game to the end and I did. Blood and Bacon is an addictive and fun arena style wave shooter. You play as a hired gun with one job at hand to rid the farm of an army of undead hogs.  As you progress new weapons and items unlock, and at the same time enemies get bigger, stronger, and grow in number. After so many days you will encounter a boss battle. Each boss battle becomes more intense and challenging making victory feel more rewarding. With the number of options from all the unlockables players are able to come up with various combinations of how to handle each day.\n\nAs for story it stays very simple and instead focuses more on the gameplay. That isn't a bad thing if you are a fan of games like Doom, or Serious Sam. The music is very catchy and really gets you in the mood to play. The graphics are closer to classic shooter style from the N64/PS2 era that just fits the theme of the game so well. In honestly it's more of a breath of fresh air compared to other modern games. The game has an art style that I haven't seen since Conker's Bad Fur Day. In all honestly it's just another reason why I enjoy this game so much.\n\nAfter all that said I still highly recommend this game. It's not only addictive but also a great time killer. So if you have the shekels to spare please pick it up. You can't go wrong with this one.","March 1","true","19.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I watched the videos on steam and I couldn't tell if it's a third person, first person, or twinstick shooter. I saw blood, I saw guns, monsters, skeletons, just a whole mess of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and it honestly reminded me of a digital homicide game. The 96% positive reviews caught my eye and I reconsidered, how much can really go wrong with $0.89 cents anyways?\n\nI'm speechless. The first two hours of gameplay went by and the thing that went through my head the most was "What the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•." The ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• animations, the low res textures, the mix between high detail modeled weapons and 90's DOOM quality level weapons, the pigs, the literal sh'it, it all has a surprisignly enjoyable outcome. This game has sh'it you did not think you'd ever experience, ever see, ever want to see, and maybe even things you'd never thought you'd feel. The mechanics are basic, the game isn't the prettiest, but it's an actual sh'it load of fun.\n\nIt has a lot of humor, both disgusting clean. The multiplayer works great. Easy to set up, easy to join, and plays really well. The game runs well, performance wise as well. You can also decide which perspective you want to play this, either FPS, TPS, Twinstick Shooter, BPS (Boot Person Shooter), with nubs, or your own custom veiwpoint with a clunky but useable freecam. I definitely recommend this if you can enjoy simple games and/or want to have a blast shooting pigs into oblivion with your friends.","April 23","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

There are a total of 6 main weapons in the game and 4 secondary weapons. Around the farm there are different things to activate, which are explained in the tutorial. Different characters can be selected, however they don't have any special abilities. To top off the worth of this game, there is even co-op. the physics in this game are wonky, but that fits a game like this.

I watched the videos on steam and I couldn't tell if it's a third person, first person, or twinstick shooter. I saw blood, I saw guns, monsters, skeletons, just a whole mess of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and it honestly reminded me of a digital homicide game. The 96% positive reviews caught my eye and I reconsidered, how much can really go wrong with $0.89 cents anyways?\n\nI'm speechless. The first two hours of gameplay went by and the thing that went through my head the most was "What the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•." The ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• animations, the low res textures, the mix between high detail modeled weapons and 90's DOOM quality level weapons, the pigs, the literal sh'it, it all has a surprisignly enjoyable outcome. This game has sh'it you did not think you'd ever experience, ever see, ever want to see, and maybe even things you'd never thought you'd feel. The mechanics are basic, the game isn't the prettiest, but it's an actual sh'it load of fun.\n\nIt has a lot of humor, both disgusting clean. The multiplayer works great. Easy to set up, easy to join, and plays really well. The game runs well, performance wise as well. You can also decide which perspective you want to play this, either FPS, TPS, Twinstick Shooter, BPS (Boot Person Shooter), with nubs, or your own custom veiwpoint with a clunky but useable freecam. I definitely recommend this if you can enjoy simple games and/or want to have a blast shooting pigs into oblivion with your friends.","April 23","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

But after a few days the pigs became stronger than my weapons so i had a hard time some times hitting them on the sweet spot. The Co-op edit is great. when you play with friends it is more fun and it is a bigger exitement reaching the top togheter. Only thing i really mis is an axe or other melee weapons to chop them up like an axe, sword or maybe even a chainsaw? That would be perfect..\nKeep up the good work guys!!\n\nP.s.

If you're looking for a cheap game with massive replay value, turn back.\n\nAt the start of the game you'll find yourself having a lot of fun and looking foward to new weapons and wondering what those things on the wall are; however, by the end of the game you'll be wanting use those guns to shoot your eyes out. Around level 45 or so, the game has no incentive to play left. You'll have unlocked all of the weapons, and more importantly, the farmer will have run out of class A puns to entertain your soul.\n\nSo why keep playing? The final achievement requires you wage through 100 levels of (by that time) terrible gameplay and lackluster mechanics. My 8.5 hours do not represent multiple playthoughs, but merely one. There is one final incentive, being the boss fight (quite a challange if you haven't started cheating), and some new dialogue from our old friend monotonous man (a. k. a. the farmer).

Especially achievements like "Get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• On by Princess" or "Get Puked on By Princess" are brilliant. And most of them can be done pretty quickly. There is not much to do except going on rampage. But I tell you, after a busy and stressful day, slaughtering zombie pigs is actually pretty relaxing.\n\nDevelopers seem to care.

It had been in the box for almost 2 years - Untill my BnB error.\nI was reluctant to swap the cards over as it trully was the only game that had errors with my setup, but I also liked what Jim Sterling had shown me. So today I swapped them out, and I'm so happy with the result.\nObviously it fived the game problem, but best of all, Everything else seams to be fine.\n\nThe main thing I want to get across though, Is how good 'Big C' was with me personally. I feel we've become friends through this experience, and he is a prime example of 'The right way to DO Steam', and 'The Greenlight Process'.\n\nOh, and I just got the game going in time for the leaderboards to be up, and while playing, 'Big C' sent me a message saying "Damn You just got most pigs grinded".

A friend of mine needed a 3d graphics card, n I found that one. They were going for $40AU delivered, so I said, get 2. I want one, that's a good deal. It had been in the box for almost 2 years - Untill my BnB error.\nI was reluctant to swap the cards over as it trully was the only game that had errors with my setup, but I also liked what Jim Sterling had shown me. So today I swapped them out, and I'm so happy with the result.\nObviously it fived the game problem, but best of all, Everything else seams to be fine.\n\nThe main thing I want to get across though, Is how good 'Big C' was with me personally. I feel we've become friends through this experience, and he is a prime example of 'The right way to DO Steam', and 'The Greenlight Process'.\n\nOh, and I just got the game going in time for the leaderboards to be up, and while playing, 'Big C' sent me a message saying "Damn You just got most pigs grinded". That was good, and felt great.\n\nThanks 'Big C' for a Kick-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• game. But more importantly, thanks for your help, and thank you so very much for doing the whole Greenlight Proccess RIGHT.\n\nGG, Peeps. GG.","February 7","true","1.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

I played a ton of this back when it was on Xbox 360, and I plan to put a lot more time into it now that it's on PC. It's an extremely cheesy, ridiculous, disgustingly bloody game where you run around shooting pigs, kicking their body parts into a grinder to buy ammo/grenades/milk/melee boosters/etc, and talk to a farmer with a close relationship with a pitchfork.\n\nIt starts off slow, but once you hit the Princess Blubbergut boss fight it all starts to get much, much more bloody and crazy. Early on you're only dealing with 10-20 pigs in a day, but after a while it'll crank up the difficulty with 50+ pigs at a time. Revenge Days are the best days of the week, giving you infinite explosive ammo and tons of pigs to gib for the grinder.\n\nThere's a decent amount of weapons, 100 days (levels), and three characters to unlock. There's a lot of content here for $1! I'd highly recommend it if you enjoy horde-style games, ridiculous gore, and a game that doesn't take itself seriously.\n\nThe only issues I've had with the game are not being able to rebind keys*, not able to edit the camera while using a keyboard (but you can with a controller by pressing Start), the black border around the screen no matter the resolution you use, some sound issues with gunshots, and sadly that co-op (which was on the Xbox 360 version) is not in this current PC port. However, the developer has said he's interested in doing it, but it sounds like it'll only be possible if the game sells well enough.\n\nThe rest of the issues I'm sure will be fixed sooner or later. The default keybindings are fine (minus X being use, instead of E), but I'd still like to be able to rebind*.\n\nAlso, the developer is extremely cool. If you have any issues, just hit him up, he responds really quickly and will try to help you fix any problems! I hope he'll bring some of his other games to Steam one day soon, I'd kill a thousand skeleton pigs just to play DeadKings (with the multiplayer included, hopefully!) on PC.\n\n*Edit: Rebinding has now been added in the most recent patch. You just have to go to your game folder, find the KEYBOARD folder, then edit the KEYS_BU.txt to your liking. Once you're done rename that file to KEYS.txt and it'll work just fine!","February 1","true","4.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZachFett/recommended/434570/","ZachFett","Zach Fett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZachFett/","897 products in account","Such a fun game. I played a ton of this back when it was on Xbox 360, and I plan to put a lot more time into it now that it's on PC. It's an extremely cheesy, ridiculous, disgustingly bloody game where you run around shooting pigs, kicking their body parts into a grinder to buy ammo/grenades/milk/melee boosters/etc, and talk to a farmer with a close relationship with a pitchfork.\n\nIt starts off slow, but once you hit the Princess Blubbergut boss fight it all starts to get much, much more bloody and crazy. Early on you're only dealing with 10-20 pigs in a day, but after a while it'll crank up the difficulty with 50+ pigs at a time. Revenge Days are the best days of the week, giving you infinite explosive ammo and tons of pigs to gib for the grinder.\n\nThere's a decent amount of weapons, 100 days (levels), and three characters to unlock. There's a lot of content here for $1! I'd highly recommend it if you enjoy horde-style games, ridiculous gore, and a game that doesn't take itself seriously.\n\nThe only issues I've had with the game are not being able to rebind keys*, not able to edit the camera while using a keyboard (but you can with a controller by pressing Start), the black border around the screen no matter the resolution you use, some sound issues with gunshots, and sadly that co-op (which was on the Xbox 360 version) is not in this current PC port. However, the developer has said he's interested in doing it, but it sounds like it'll only be possible if the game sells well enough.\n\nThe rest of the issues I'm sure will be fixed sooner or later. The default keybindings are fine (minus X being use, instead of E), but I'd still like to be able to rebind*.\n\nAlso, the developer is extremely cool. If you have any issues, just hit him up, he responds really quickly and will try to help you fix any problems! I hope he'll bring some of his other games to Steam one day soon, I'd kill a thousand skeleton pigs just to play DeadKings (with the multiplayer included, hopefully!) on PC.\n\n*Edit: Rebinding has now been added in the most recent patch. You just have to go to your game folder, find the KEYBOARD folder, then edit the KEYS_BU.txt to your liking. Once you're done rename that file to KEYS.txt and it'll work just fine!","February 1","true","4.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The sound design isn't anything out of the ordinary but is satisfying, especially when you use the rocket launcher. Most of the guns have incomplete or basically non existent reload animations, and you can reload constantly even when your magazine is full.  The voice acting for the farmer is completely awful, maybe on purpose, but the voice acting for bosses and the sounds made by the pigs and grinder are spot on. There is some occasional humor to the game, most of it coming from the Farmer's lines, the bosses and hidden messages sprawled about the farm, but the game itself is pretty funny considering you are basically murdering a ton of hogs and pigs and undead pigs.\n\nIn many ways this game is like survival mode in L4D, just very barebones. Each pig you kill, you can push it's gibs or entire body into a grinder that magically turns them in to resources so you can buy grenades, revive pills, milk, ammo, nukes, and superstrength.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about the actual gameplay is that survival mode takes a long time. 100 days. If you are actually pushing everything in to the grinder, it takes quite a while to get through each day. Every 10 days my co op partner and I would be like "30 days and it's not over? Maybe 50 because we have like 2 guns left to unlock? Maybe 75? It's 100!?"  All in all though, sure, it's worth 90 cents for a few hours of fun until you get tired of it. I don't know what the original price of the game was but I'd still pay a few dollars more for it.","April 30","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

Honestly, if you buy this game you should pretty much know just about what you're getting: a game about gibbing creatures into meaty chunks and lots of ham. And if you go in expecting that, it's honestly a -good game-. I would fully recommend this game, if it weren't for one particular boss fight. It's not that the boss is -hard-, or that it's unfair, it's that the boss...literally ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on you. I mean that in the most literal of ways. It diarhea dumps on you. Also vomits on you.
