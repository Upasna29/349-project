Visually speaking, it's fantastic and the soundtrack is awesome! The controls are also very smooth and there are several unique modes which definitely help to keep the game interesting. However, the replayability is not too amazing. I personally would've loved to see more features including achievements and/or some sort of multiplayer. I'm sure these features would certainly add to the replayability and improve the game overall. But nevertheless, it's a pretty fun (free) game and I would recommend it if you enjoy simple arcade games or are looking to kill some time.","January 18, 2015","true","1.4"," 42 of 45 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","42","45","3","1"

I played this game years ago as a free download.\nIt's still the same game with extra modes. It started out as a clone of a popular xbox live game and turned out to be better than that game in almost every way.\nGreat game if you have a 360 pc controller or equivalent.\n\nIssues I have with this version.\nWhere are the graphics settings? The original game had great customisable settings from resolution to post processing.\nThis game looks out of focus and I want to dial the screen effects down...so game devs put that back..why did you even take it away?\nAlso...the game wont play music or let me select it from my 'my music' folder...sure you can select the folder but nothing happens after that.\n\nSo the only complaints I have are the things you took away from the original free game..or..things that worked in the original but dont now.\nWhy dont you maybe just put the orgiinal game on steam...there was nothing wrong with it. But hey the game is free....so...i don't know.\nIt makes me want to download and play the original again...mostly because the graphics were customisable...honestly once you took away some of the effects, set it to your native resolution and took away the post processing, the game looked so much better back in the day.\n\nIt's still a thumbs up from me though.","January 16, 2015","true","0.3"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","26","29","4","0"

Very enjoyable to play with its many different modes, but local and global leaderboards (no friends leaderboards sadly!) as well as an ingame achievement system add extra urge to keep trying again, and again, and again.\n\nThose sensitive to screen flashes may want to be a little careful with this one or play in shorter sesions.  Plays well with mouse+keys or a controller.\n\nAll in all a well crafted shooty game that's miles better than the majority of tosh that gets thrown on Steam these days and well worth your money.  Wait.. It's free? Cool !\n\nWaaaait... No ingame microtransactions either?  Ermagerd ! That sounds awesome, surely there's some catch?  Nope! This was put on Steam for free to promote the development kit it was built with.

In addition to this, the keyboard controls are atrocious. Look, I've complained before about retro platformers not having good keyboard binds, but thats fine because there is no standard. However, this is a twin stick shooter... and binding of issac is a twin stick shooter also so there IS a standard! using WASD to attack and mouse to move is extremely disorienting. WASD should be move, and arrows should be for attacking, like in binding of issac.

If you got a passing interest in Twin Stick Shooters, play it. I've only played with a controller though, not sure how keyboard is.\n\nIt doesn't do the "get hit 3 times and it's game over" thing either. You start out with 100 Energy(health), and lose health with each hit(duh). There are Energy(health) Pick-Ups though. There are Multiplier Pick-Ups that increase the score you get per hit, and Weapon Pick-Ups that increase the amount of bullets shot at a time. There are also a bunch game mode variations to the classic Geometry Wars type formula. And finally "Trials" which is the in-game non-steam achievements. There are 200 Trials, and while some require you to play in certain game modes, they can be done on any difficulty(easy, normal, hard, insane), but each difficulty awards a different percentage to the 100%, and only the highest difficulty counts, so to get 100% you need to do all on Insane Difficulty.\n\nIf you like Twin Stick Shooter and/or Bullet Hell type games like Geometry Wars, then download this free game, which is easily worth $5-$10 in my opinion.

Back (old man alert!) when I was a kid, I didn't get more than 2 or 3 games a year, the rest had to be rentals. Nowadays, we have access to hundreds of thousands of games. Once you take into account the indie bundles, the incredible discounts, the F2P MMOs, the freeware, all the "free" games made possible via emulators, you get several times more bang for your buck than ever before.\n\nEchoes+ is a free game, no strings attached either. You're not obligated to pay for the full game, there aren't any microtransactions, and it isn't free because nobody in their right mind would play it let alone pay for it. Echoes+ is simply free, and pretty dang good.\n\nThe best description I can come up with this game is that it's a twin-stick-not-quite-asteroids shooter. Yes, I'm well aware that it's not the catchiest term but whatever. Basically the goal is to survive as long as possible and get the high-score. You survive by dodging rocks, and you score high by shooting everything and collecting multiplier bonuses. There are multiple difficulties for ever-increasing rock intensity and a variety of modes. Limited leaderboards (top 10 only) and non-Steam achievements round out the package. There's even a more traditional Asteroids clone.\n\nUnlike most twin-stick shooters, you actually get a health meter in this game. This tends to result in longer attempts than most 1-3 life games. However, as you progress there are about 300 rocks for every health pick-up you'll find, and whenever you take damage you lose a number of weapon power-ups. Well actually they get scattered, so while you can pick them up again, it just adds to the chaos. In short, you can get hit, but you shouldn't get hit. That sounds sensible enough doesn't it? After a certain point it becomes seemingly impossible to not take damage. This is about where the "git gud wall" makes its appearance. You can't have a classic arcade game, without an invisible wall that forces you to step your game up to the next level.\n\nI'm not sure where I'd rank Echoes+ in the great pantheon of free videogames, but it is good enough to check out.

Though it is not, it is very similar(Though I enjoyed Geometry Wars better). I expected more out of this game even though it was free. I can do something /very very/ similar to this game in flash in my free time. I did not find this game enjoyable for more than a few minutes. I am not one of those who enjoy playing against highscores. I find it too repetative and a "scam" to add "playability".\n\nPros and cons:\n\nCons:\nFullscreen only. No windowed mode, no resolution options, no nothing of that sorts.\nOptions/settings menu is barebones.\nLimited controls-Playing with mouse and keyboard, or keyboard only. You can only shoot directional, and not 360 degrees. Only: Up, Down, Left, and Right.(Though there is controller/joystick support. But I have a hunch it will be the same limitations)\nArt style is too similar to Geometry Wars.\nNot many features. Only 6 game modes + "Challenges". 4 difficulties. Which, Insane does not seem at all hard for me. But that might be because I have experience in these kinds of games.\nOnly a few minutes of fun\n\nPros:\nDecent art style. Though I have some beef with it. (see cons)\nCompletely free, no BS, no Microtransactions\nGlobal and Local leaderboards.\nA boredum killer. (But nothing more. Unless you are the kind of person that loves to try to beat your own highscore or other's highscores)\n\nIt is a good thing this game is free. Because, I honestly would not pay more than $0.20 for something that is basically a flash game. Though, there is some work put into it, I still would not pay for it.

After several minutes you level up and then some poweful enemies show up.

Also, sometimes in the middle of gameplay I experience a 1.5-second moment of lag, during which I apparently collide with and bounce off the edge, taking minor damage. However, I do currently have, um... let's go with a "shitaki mushroom" of a laptop, so.... That might be why it's slightly buggy for me. So, not for lower-end computers if you're a gamer who simply cannot take even just a bit of lag during an action game. Otherwise it is playable on lower-end computers. Just expect lower-end scores if you play on lower-end computers. ;P\n\nWhile the game does appear to be susceptable to hacking for a high-score (for a moment while I was playing there were high-score banners about this "HackMan" person getting ~10-18 times higher score than the 'second'-place people, which did not at all seem legit), scores resulting from that behavior are quickly removed (like every single score made by that "HackMan" person was probably not even 5 minutes after I first noticed it), which shows that there is a team keeping an eye on things. So don't HackMan- that won't get ya anywhere. ;P After all, we're shooting neon asteroids, not eating humorously-mispelled words and running from ghosts. XP\n\nAll in all I really like it even though I still can't clear the Echoes mode on the Easy difficulty and even though my shlaptop won't quite let me experience it's full glory.

Was playing GeoWars 3 over the weekend and thought it was a shame the game didn't control like Echoes. By default you move your "ship" with the mouse and aim with WASD. This feels odd at first, but it's really the way to go for a game like this on PC. While your aiming options are limited it works will for the way Echoes is designed. It turns into a game of juking and jiving around the board with your mouse while spraying destruction at what you're kiting away from.\n\nThere are two bummers however when going from Echoes to Echoes plus. First you can't aim diagonally. It might be an issue from keyboard to keyboard but I can aim diagonally on my old version of Echoes and I can't aim with what's on Steam.

Also, sometimes in the middle of gameplay I experience a 1.5-second moment of lag, during which I apparently collide with and bounce off the edge, taking minor damage. However, I do currently have, um... let's go with a "shitaki mushroom" of a laptop, so.... That might be why it's slightly buggy for me. So, not for lower-end computers if you're a gamer who simply cannot take even just a bit of lag during an action game. Otherwise it is playable on lower-end computers. Just expect lower-end scores if you play on lower-end computers. ;P\n\nWhile the game does appear to be susceptable to hacking for a high-score (for a moment while I was playing there were high-score banners about this "HackMan" person getting ~10-18 times higher score than the 'second'-place people, which did not at all seem legit), scores resulting from that behavior are quickly removed (like every single score made by that "HackMan" person was probably not even 5 minutes after I first noticed it), which shows that there is a team keeping an eye on things. So don't HackMan- that won't get ya anywhere. ;P After all, we're shooting neon asteroids, not eating humorously-mispelled words and running from ghosts. XP\n\nAll in all I really like it even though I still can't clear the Echoes mode on the Easy difficulty and even though my shlaptop won't quite let me experience it's full glory.

Was playing GeoWars 3 over the weekend and thought it was a shame the game didn't control like Echoes. By default you move your "ship" with the mouse and aim with WASD. This feels odd at first, but it's really the way to go for a game like this on PC. While your aiming options are limited it works will for the way Echoes is designed. It turns into a game of juking and jiving around the board with your mouse while spraying destruction at what you're kiting away from.\n\nThere are two bummers however when going from Echoes to Echoes plus. First you can't aim diagonally. It might be an issue from keyboard to keyboard but I can aim diagonally on my old version of Echoes and I can't aim with what's on Steam. Second, the old version had the ability to customize what you aimed and shot with. i.e. move with mouse and aim with joystick; really the optimal setup.

Also, sometimes in the middle of gameplay I experience a 1.5-second moment of lag, during which I apparently collide with and bounce off the edge, taking minor damage. However, I do currently have, um... let's go with a "shitaki mushroom" of a laptop, so.... That might be why it's slightly buggy for me. So, not for lower-end computers if you're a gamer who simply cannot take even just a bit of lag during an action game. Otherwise it is playable on lower-end computers. Just expect lower-end scores if you play on lower-end computers. ;P\n\nWhile the game does appear to be susceptable to hacking for a high-score (for a moment while I was playing there were high-score banners about this "HackMan" person getting ~10-18 times higher score than the 'second'-place people, which did not at all seem legit), scores resulting from that behavior are quickly removed (like every single score made by that "HackMan" person was probably not even 5 minutes after I first noticed it), which shows that there is a team keeping an eye on things. So don't HackMan- that won't get ya anywhere. ;P After all, we're shooting neon asteroids, not eating humorously-mispelled words and running from ghosts. XP\n\nAll in all I really like it even though I still can't clear the Echoes mode on the Easy difficulty and even though my shlaptop won't quite let me experience it's full glory.

Was playing GeoWars 3 over the weekend and thought it was a shame the game didn't control like Echoes. By default you move your "ship" with the mouse and aim with WASD. This feels odd at first, but it's really the way to go for a game like this on PC. While your aiming options are limited it works will for the way Echoes is designed. It turns into a game of juking and jiving around the board with your mouse while spraying destruction at what you're kiting away from.\n\nThere are two bummers however when going from Echoes to Echoes plus. First you can't aim diagonally. It might be an issue from keyboard to keyboard but I can aim diagonally on my old version of Echoes and I can't aim with what's on Steam. Second, the old version had the ability to customize what you aimed and shot with. i.e. move with mouse and aim with joystick; really the optimal setup. Or with me being an ESDF player, I'd really appreciate the option to customize what you use with up,down,left,right. However, GeoWars doesn't let you do that either >_<","January 19, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Its not for those people who dont like old school shooters - if you have a low bordem threshold and need to continually have different challenges to prevent you falling asleep, then this is the game for you - this game is perfect for anyone over 30, who like proper shooters.\n\nThe mouse controls should be better though - you would have thought the left mouse button would fire, rather than having to use the cursor keys.  However, I suppose that would have made things too easy (and too much like Geomtry Wars).\n\nThere is a supposed lack of options available.  Whilst a resolution change option would be nice, the ability to switch to window mode is not needed - who in their right mind plays a FPS in a window !?\n\nIt is a nice advertisement for App Game Kit 2, although it should be noted that other engines (ike SDL2, GLBasic or Monkey) would just be as capable of running the game.

Despite some people stating you cant fire diagonally, you can - you just need to press multiple arrow keys.  Simples!\n\nThe graphics are very nice - very similar to Binary Zoo's previous games (Duo and Mono), with fluid movement and a fast pace.  Its not for those people who dont like old school shooters - if you have a low bordem threshold and need to continually have different challenges to prevent you falling asleep, then this is the game for you - this game is perfect for anyone over 30, who like proper shooters.\n\nThe mouse controls should be better though - you would have thought the left mouse button would fire, rather than having to use the cursor keys.  However, I suppose that would have made things too easy (and too much like Geomtry Wars).\n\nThere is a supposed lack of options available.  Whilst a resolution change option would be nice, the ability to switch to window mode is not needed - who in their right mind plays a FPS in a window !?\n\nIt is a nice advertisement for App Game Kit 2, although it should be noted that other engines (ike SDL2, GLBasic or Monkey) would just be as capable of running the game.

It would be annoying for any kind of game, but for a bullet hell, it's so frustrating.  It leaves the game essentially unplayable. The only way I've seen to resync the cursors is to pause the game, get both of them realligned in a corner, then unpause...only for them to get unsynced either as soon as I unpause, or 5 seconds after. The unsyncing limits my movement to maybe half the screen, maximum. Just...not a good design.

Pretty Decent Free Game, Even if It's Designed to Show Off Tech.Genre: Bullet Hell Arcade Game.\nDeveloped & Published by: Binary Zoo & The Game Creators & The Game Creators Ltd\nPlatform: Windows, Mac\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nThis is a competent title considering for a Free-to-Play twin stick shooter. This isn't my genre of choice, hence why there's very little play time for this one. But I had to give it a look and see if it was even worth installing. Generally, I find that twin-sticks are overly difficult for my tastes (and this one isn't any different) and I don't find getting the highest score possible all that compelling. You'll find six different game modes ranging from time attack, survival, 10-level campaign to classic asteroids play. Each adding some diversity.\n\nPC Settings\nPC options are pretty bare-boned. All you can change are audio levels and movement speed. (No resolution, fullscreen/windowed or other graphical options). You can play either the game's music or your own songs. You can also use either a controller, mouse or keyboard though the controller is the better way to go.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nMusic is decently up beat, graphics are nice and retro but big surprise there and combat has a decent amount of feedback. Though I feel like the only way you lose is by being overwhelmed. That just might be my awfulness with this genre. It's hard to argue with a good free game, even if it's advertising a game development kit. Solid action, decent variety and fun gameplay make it a recommend from me. If this is your genre of interest, it seems to be worth giving a look.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","January 16, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It says free-to-play, which makes you think there might be in-app stuff to buy, but I didn't see anything like that.  It's just free.\n\nIt's similar to Asteroids, in that you are a single ship fighting agaist rock-shaped targets that break into 2 smaller versions of themselves when damaged enough.. then those break into smaller pieces, etc, until you end up with pieces small enough to destroy.\n\nIt's different from Asteroids because it doesn't have that intertia-based movement mechanic that made the classic game so difficult to master, which is a very good thing because this game is a lot more chaotic, and your movements need to be a lot more precise and quick.  There are also different kinds of space rocks, like ones that spawn in a big line on one side of the screen, then sweep across.. or ones that form a snake-like chain and chase you.\n\nControls are simple.. I played on a 360 pad, and one stick moves me around, while the other stick shoots in whatever direction I push it.  A or RT detonates a bomb that destroys a lot of the stuff on the screen.  There are pickups that restore your health, improve your weapons, etc.\n\nThere's a lot of movement on the screen, lots of color and everything gets pretty insane after a while.. there isn't a whole lot of excessive flashing lights and stuff, but just in case, if you have epilepsy, be careful about this one.. I just don't have a good enough understanding of that condition to know whether or not it'll trigger a seizure or something.\n\nAnyway, It's not groundbreaking, or a super-original idea or anything.. but it's fun, the neon visual style is appealing, and it's free, so why not give it a try?","January 16, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet 2 people found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The generic electronic soundtrack may grate on your nerves, but luckily Echoes+ includes in-game custom soundtrack support. While it does nothing to further the twin-stick shooter species, it has a very attractive pricetag (free.)\n\nGrab a controller--or suffer through with KB & Mouse--and see if you can manage to dislodge some of the very dedicated maniacs on the leaderboards.","February 25","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is an evolved version of Asteroids with improved graphics and colors. The game sort of reminds me of PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX since it has a retro feel but fits the graphics of the modern era. For a free to play game, it is well made and comes with a variety of game modes. The music is pretty good but the controls are a bit sluggish. WASD moves your ship, and your mouse aims the blasters. The problem is that your ship feels like it's moving through mud, and the gun doesn't sensitively respond to your movement. Another issue is the overload of explosions that are simultaneously on screen in later levels. The screen gets to a point where you can't really see where your ship is, especially with the time delay I was talking about earlier. Other than these two problems, the game is a space shooter that does it's job of being a space shooter. Rating: 6/10","February 17, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
