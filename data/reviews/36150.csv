I remember playing the first one as a kid, and could not wait to try the second and third games as well.\nTo this day, I still play all three games, and love the addicting city-management style of game.\nI prefer the first game's graphics over the second and third, but the gameplay is just as good! The second and third games have Sandbox mode, also!","May 27, 2014","true","6.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

A bit of tongue-in-cheek humour for the older set, and lots of colourful characters to keep the young'uns interested.   Still playing the first game in the set, so I expect evolution in gameply mechanics.  Small screen size is ideal for laptops, but a chore in big-picture mode.  Definitely not controller-friendly.","March 19, 2013","true","1.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"
