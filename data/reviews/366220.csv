This is one of my favorites now. Life is Feudal has a lot of ideas that are similar.\nI played Wurm Online a bit, but hated all the griefers. It felt more like a second job with a bad boss and co-workers who thought you needed a good backstab for doing your job properly.  LOL\n\nThis allows me to play with people I can trust. I even found a couple of decent community servers. It is quite fun, if not "all your time" consuming.\n\nPeople getting crashes, 99% likely you need to go to your LaughConfig.ini and make these changes:\n\n[Runtime]\nOverrideDefaultJavaPath=false\nJavaPath=\n[Memory]\nInitialHeap=1024m\nMaxHeapSize=4096m\n[VMParams]\nJvmParam0=-XX:+AggressiveOpts\n:Or whatever amount of RAM you (want to/can) assign.\n\nSome of the features I like are :\nWeather, including Seasons\nToo many skills to master\nCustomizable dedicated servers\nVoxel landscapes\nCombat can be hard without decent gear\nBuilding my own place\nYou build everything, which makes it feel real, IMHO\nYou can get lost in the wilderness and it FEELS like you are lost\nThe Long Game\nCommunity is openm and mostly not condescending, but are slow to respond because they are PLAYING\nThings I don't care for:\nNext to no documentation, even with strong google-fu\nWhen there IS documentation, it becomes educated guesswork, because it is written by people who know how already\nIF your not educated in map making, SQL, and/or server maintanence, you'll likely be lost\nTextures can be a bit dated\nMods are just coming along, wish we were 9-12 months into the mod cycle already, LOL\nI seriously recommend this game to survival players.

When it says you can go anywhere and do it; you can. Now that the game is available off of the official servers it takes that tagline and runs even further with it. This offline version will not only offer the go anywhere, do anything mentality it will also offer moddability and innovation.\n\nThe game is written in Java and the code is thus far unobfuscated. This means that any modding community that crops up, and we're already seeing a seed of one, will be able to expand relatively unfettered. This means a lot for the longevity of the game, which by the way is already monumental (the online version has existed for a decade), will stretch even further. It will also allow for advances in approachability for the uninitiated.\n\nThe game itself is by first definition; relaxing. It lacks the fast paced motifs and get-stoned-by-some-naked-dude-as-a-fresh-spawn mentality of other games of this type. It also lacks cutting edge graphics, but the graphics it does present are relatively clean and playable. I see some beauty in it and you can too if you just look at the screenshots. This also allows for the game to run on older systems. The game also lacks smooth animations, but the animations that do exist get the point across.\n\nThe game's main to dos are listed in the various trailers and description. A lot of it fails to mention the passable magic/faith system in the game that takes it from just a medieval todo to a more fantasy one. Also, the dragons, fiends, giant spiders, and hellthings help move that along.\n\nThe game as of now offers two modes. An Adventure mode which I would recemmond to new players as it bundles in a tutorial, and a "creative" mode which uses the term not like that certain world-renowned voxel game, but in the sense that the land is virgin and it is up to you and/or your friends to shape it. The adventure has some prebuilt areas and will guide you through the shallows of the game.\n\nOverall Wurm is a game similar to many, but in a way unique, and the first of it's kind by age, if not function. I'm not saying the game is perfect, because no one will say that, but it is a solid buy. Do not expect instant gratification from this game, and in return it will give you hours, days, months, and maybe years of play time.\n\nSo go now! Strike the earth, mold the clay, and fell the tree, but most of all... Welcome to Wurm Unlimited!","October 21, 2015","true","58.8"," 373 of 422 people (88%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","88","373","422","24","13"

Wurm Unlimited. Where the heck do I start?\n\nSo here are the pros/cons of Wurm Online, then I'll do pros/cons of Wurm Unlimited.\n\nWurm Online:\n\nPros\n1) The game is more realistic in terms of crafting, skilling, etc. than any game I've ever come across.\n2) A sense of accomplishment is just around the corner as you build up your character, your deed, or just run off exploring all over the beautiful landscape.\n3) Many will disagree with this, but I think the graphics are a 'pro' for me. I really enjoy the graphics. It's not crazy, but they aren't Minecraft. It is a gorgeous game, in my opinion.\n4) The freedom you get in the game is astonishing and absolutely mind-boggling.\n5) Just one more plank.\n6) Okay, okay, just one more.\n7) Ya' know what, I'll just finish this wall.\n\nCons\n1) For most people, the menus/submenus will be a red 'x' against the game. But honestly, most things are intuitive (use a saw on a log and you'll make things that you would if you were using a saw on a log in RL).\n2) HUGE learning curve (although once you learn how to play, you're like 'duh..that makes sense').\n3) Fighting anything, especially early on in your Wurm life, can take for-EVER!!! This has always been a detractor for me in the game. That said, I must also note that once you obtain a decent QL (quality) weapon with some nice enchants, the battles are pretty quick, but getting the silver to buy such weapons will take a lot of work!\n4) Just one more plank.\n5) Okay, okay, just one more!\n6) Ya' know what? I'll just finish this house.\n\nWurm Unlimited\n\nPros\n1) It's friggin' singleplayer if you want! Take all of the pros from above and plop them down into a singleplayer mode where you can be a GM and fart around on a server! For a lot of players, this is just what they were looking for!\n\n2) No subscription needed and there are tons of servers available - including my own -- Taking Without Constent Dedicated 24/7 -- no subscription needed with the same awesome community-driven action!\n\n3) The GMs of the online servers for Wurm Unlimited are going to be able to help you much more than they ever would on Wurm Online! Your experience could be free from some of the most frustrating aspects of the game if you choose the right server to play on!\n\nCons\n\n1) They changed the way skills are gained and it was a pretty gnarly overhaul. Funny because I didn't think it could be as big of a change, but after playing for 100+ hours, it was a big change. The only con here, however, is the fact that the GM has to constantly tweak the settings to get it close to being realistic, but not annoying (especially the farming).\n\n2) The rest are just the same as for Wurm Online.\n\nOverall, this game is simply amazing. When I get on, I get lost in the Wurm world. I'm a GM now and am hosting my server through Citadel, and I must say, it's awesome to have an investment into the game like I have now. And if you're looking for a great server that will be focused on community, and alleviating a lot of annoyances in the game, look no further than TWOC - Taking Without Consent.\n\n","November 10, 2015","true","266.0"," 274 of 303 people (90%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","90","274","303","42","2"

It is HARD FOR A REASON, these people want easy and their hands held every moment of their gameplay experience and compare this game to things that have absolutely NO comparison, ex ARK, Rust, or any "new" survival game that comes out. I just want to get this point across, these games are a fad just like Dayz, a WoW expansion, where you move on and may or may not go back to those games. Wurm has been out for 12 years and its here on steam? Its staying strong and with a larger community on steam you can immagion how great that is to not only me but you as well to enjoy, in my opinion one of the best games ever made in history. also use wurmpedia...(all questions forever answered)\nThis has been the most honest thing I've ever written on steam thanks for reading though!","October 24, 2015","true","178.3"," 197 of 214 people (92%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","92","197","214","12","6"

And, if you don't try playing this game, you are missing out on one of the best fantasy building/crafting games ever.\n\nI dedicated 440 hours in 48 days to this game. I started playing Oct. 29th. At first I didn't get what made the game so good, but as I kept playing I began to understand that it is unique and fun. I built mines, roads, houses, farms, a blacksmith, an inn, a bakery and other shops, a dock with ships, tons of tools and furniture, bred horses, sheep and cared for other animals, including a brown bear which was my mount. I eventually rented a Wurm Server so that my friends and I could all play together. As I said, if you like medieval fantasy crafting games, this game is the best one I've played. What's nice is that you can set your own personal configuration settings for your world to make the experience feel less of a grind. Doing so helps to speed up progress. I did a x15 skill gain, with a x3 action multiplier.\n\nI suppose my situation was unfortunate. I often found myself playing the game alone. Here I had this beautiful town taking shape, but no one to see it. It was like living in a ghost town. I did have some playtime with a few friends, but everyone was busy building their own settlements. I felt I was the only one who'd occasionally visit the other settlements to admire progression.\n\nIt was disheartening that my Wurm Unlimited experience did not go as I expected. I had hoped to get more out of the multiplayer aspect than I did. It is such a great game, albeit the graphics and animations are outdated.\n\nTry the game. If you're playing with friends, stick together. Make one settlement. Build a community. Explore the world together. There's potential for a great experience.","December 17, 2015","true","529.7"," 220 of 251 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","220","251","8","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tatharnuar/recommended/366220/","tatharnuar","Tathar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tatharnuar/","190 products in account","I love this game.  That said, there are some things you should know before you buy it, or else you set yourself up for disappointment.  Most of the negative reviews are from people who didn't know these things before they purchased the game.  That just means the game wasn't meant for them, not that there's anything wrong with the game.\n\nFirst, and most importantly, this game does not hold your hand and guide you through how to play.  Exploration and discovery are part of the game by design.  You get a few popup messages explaining some basic concepts, but then you're on your own.  Plan on spending a healthy amount of time on the Wurmpedia looking up how things work, or you will find yourself disappointed and frustrated.  Alternatively, if you like a challenge, it's possible to discover how things work on your own by trial and error, but not many people can do that.\n\nSecond, the graphics are not visually impressive.  Some of the graphics are from as long ago as 2006.  They serve a function, and that's it.  If you buy this game expecting AAA modern graphics, you will be disappointed.  Don't expect much from the graphics.\n\nThird, this game is *deep* and can be overwhelming for some.  If you get the chance, take a look at the Skills window and browse through the list.  Every one of those skills is implemented into the game and affects what you can do in it.  There are also a few actions that don't have an associated skill.  If I haven't convinced you to devote time to browsing the Wurmpedia already, this is a very good reason to do that.\n\nFinally, this game is about survival in a medieval fantasy setting, not about action.  Don't expect much from combat.  Combat is pretty much just targeting something and just making sure you're the right distance from the target to effectively fight.  Instead, enter the game with the expectation that you'll have to "work" towards building your home and training hard enough to put up a fight against hungry spiders, and that the game will reward you by allowing you to make your permanent mark on the game world.\n\nYour actions have lasting impact in Wurm.  Long after you stop playing on a public server and the buildings you constructed start to crumble, other players will be able to explore the ruins of your settlement and discover what you did there.  If you play on a server that has been around long enough, you can do the same, and it's pretty fun.\n\nIf you're still wondering whether this is the game for you, just try out the MMO version of this game, Wurm Online.  It's free to play, if you don't mind the level 20 skill cap, or you can pay to go premium, which unlocks higher skill levels.  Wurm Unlimited is essentially an official private server for Wurm Online, so if you find that you like Wurm Online, but either can't afford to spend money each month on premium and deed upkeep, or don't have the time to invest regularly into it, then Wurm Unlimited was made for you.","October 27, 2015","true","481.4"," 98 of 105 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","98","105","0","11"

Good and bad, of course. Was it worth it though? Yes...So much yes. Especially with the friends I made. (hey! :D)\n\nIf you've played the game,.. Well, WU is basically WO...With full customization at our control.\n\n\nWurm is a Sandbox....For me, it's "THE" Sandbox. And now that it's released it's own stand-alone version, where I can mod the game to my liking, It's trully  - Finally - The game i've been waiting for.\n\nWith over a 100 skills (I'm not sure the exact amount) you can bet you will find many that you will enjoy, I won't lie though, be warned, Some (Like beverages) Have little use currently.  (There ARE uses, just not much) And some skills have this problem.  But once mods are made, I can't imagine what this will become.\n\nHowever, there are PLENTY that work. Blacksmithing, Woodcutting, Carpentry, Weaponsmithing, Fishing, Mining, this list doesn't really stop.   most skills involve what we call "Imping" - Which is improving your tools, weapons, armour, gear, vehicles, Ect.  The higher the "quality" of a item, the better it performs in it's task. and the less damage it takes while in-use. I can assure you one thing, You can-not find a better crafting game right now. And I don't think you will for a VERY long time.  this game lives, and breathes, because of the crafting.\n\nNow, in WO (Wurm online) The skill gain is very slow, it takes years to level up skills, and only a hand-full of people have hit "100" in a skill.  However, WU you'll be able to set your own speed, So if you wish - You can have it slow, Or you can speed it up. it's YOUR choice! (Default speed on WU is 10x that of WO)  - As a side note, The higher your skill, the better you can craft things /Improve them.  At very low skill,  lets say for example 30, it would be very hard to improve a item over 40.\n\nThe World: Everythings destroyable. Every tree, Every mountain.  Want to dig down 500 feet? Well, if your servers that big. go for it!!  Terraforming in this game was hard to understand at first (For me) But after a while, it got so much fun. You and the players build it, are you in the middle of a huge landmass in a lake, but want to connect it to the ocean? it may take a while, but you can dig/surface mine a "canal" To the ocean, so boats can enter!\n\nEach tree is one that randomaly generates, or you plant.  You can "pick sprouts" from trees, "prune" them to let them live longer, ect.  Forestry/gardening is one of my favorite skills. I love creating my own forest for the world.\n\nTrasportation? Yep. we got that. Horses with saddles/horseshoes/bardings to increase speed, armour, turning. ect.\nCarts, Large and small, Wagons, and multiple boats (Caravel, Cog, Knarr, ect) I personally am not a huge fan of sailing, as it's pretty slow, but (Again!) we get to change that up in our own servers. :)\n\nCombat: Combat is a bit odd, and I really want mods to improve/overhaul this.  The combat is, basically, clicking on a button for where you will aim (The head? The legs? Ect) and same for blocking.  The good thing is, aiming at area's have benefits.....For example, if your in PVP and you hit a guy hard in the foot, he will start moving slower.\n\nThere IS archery and spells, However, I will warn you - It's not exactly a "main combat" role at the moment.  Mods again, are likely to change this.  Archery REALLY needs to be easier to use as it's a button-click fest right now.  Spells are only "supportive" in combat, and not really a main fighting style.\n\n\nAnd we have a "God" system in wurm, This is a very big part of the game, as we have "missions" (sort-of like quest that random-generate) to do things for them for karma (used in spells) and sleep bonus (used for gaining double exp for a short time)  Also, you can become a follower of one that gives some benefits.  You can also become a priest, Which allows you to enchant weapons, armour, and tools for special effects (Increased speed-of-use, More damage, More experience gain, Ect) I really can't wait to see what mods come out for priest...and new spells. :D  Also, champions.  basically a better version of a priest, but limited in number on server.  They're mainly used for combat - they're the big PVP guys you want to kill first! or you will face the wrath of there gods abilitys.\n\nEDIT TO PRIEST:  Priest (Not champions) by default are limited in what they can do, For example, Vynora priest can't mine, dig, ect.  though they can cut trees, farm, ect (each priest has different can-do and can-not.  All priest are not allowed to "Imp" things.  However, in WU you can change this to have different/no restrictions if desired.  Champions do NOT have these restrictions, despite being able to cast spells ect.\n\n\nCONS?\n\nBugs,  Lots of weird, little bugs.  I have very few issues personally, but some players have a lot.  (For example, a large cart on some players screen will appear 10 feet away from where it really is...) Or doors not opening (usually due to server lag, though)  Nothing to big usually, But a bit of annoyance at times.\n\nAnimations aren't the greatest.  I really wish there was more, and "better" of what we have.\n\nCharacter models feel odd because of the animations. They also could have a model improvement IMO, however, they don't look to bad. (Also, some of the gear for them actually does look pretty sick!, that's not a con obviously :P )\n\nDefault speed of WO (which Isn't the same as WU) is pretty slow for the normal player.  WU is a lot faster from what I've seen so far.  But the game isn't like, For example, Ark. it's slow.  I personally Like this, as it gives a sense of accomplishment.  The good news is, however, that if you DON'T like this, you can speed it up as much as you like, and where you like. (Or the server you join can)\n\n\nIf you want a REAL sandbox, One that REALLY let's you do what you want...... I can't say there is a better game out there.  Since I found wurm, I've not found one even come close (and I've tried at times) And with being able to mod WU, really anything is possible.  I'd highly recommend.\n\n\nIF you have any questions regarding Wurm at all, I'd love to help if able! Pm or comment and I'll see if I can help. And, please, If you agree or disagree with this review, please say so! I would love to hear other peoples opinions on this game, good or bad.  I wish I could share the storys i've had in this game, because I've had so many. Especially with all the friends I've made.\n\n\nTLDR: Highly Recommend to anyone looking for the "true" Sandbox. Especially with WU being moddable.\n\n\nEdit: Also like to state, i've played wurm since 2012, which isn't long at all compared to most members. But in that time I quickly grasped the game and have gotten to the point now where I can self-sustain all my things at 90ql and do my own enchants.  Most people specialize, I personally, can't.  My minds all over the place.  So if you only like a few skills, or only a few interest you - Don't worry. The skills have a LOT in them that you can spend, literally, years with.  or, if your interested in all of them......you can easily do all of them! (You aren't limited to skills, UNLESS you priest! I will add info to the priest section on this)","October 21, 2015","true","153.7"," 161 of 200 people (81%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","81","161","200","24","24"

My only gripe with the online version back then was the absolutely horrific graphics and the fact that a good 80-90% of the map was populated with people's old ♥♥♥♥, so it was very difficult to carve out a niche for yourself in all that.\n\nWhat Code Club AB have done by releasing Wurm as a standalone version is nothing short of amazing. This game planted the seed in Notch's mind for Minecraft, and in itself is a much more complex, deep and time consuming game with much the same premise: exist and thrive in an empty world.\n\nBut the only real similarity that Minecraft and Wurm share here that I want to bring attention to is the core principle of the entire game: Teamwork and creativity.\n\nYou can terraform, build a house, tame animals, fight monsters, craft armour and weapons, and even commit yourself to one of the two religions in the game, but it does take a lot of time and a lot of teamwork. Whether that's something you find appealing or cannot stand, there is grinding in this game. But it's a grind that pays off with legendary tales and a real world that you strived to construct from nothing.\n\nIf one were to take even a cursory glance at Wurm Online's colourful history, they would find a completely player driven lore comprised of the rise and fall of empires, epic constructions of vast cities and trade highways, and to me, that highlights what Wurm is: stories. Being a part of something bigger. Helping to construct something lasting that you know took a lot of time and effort between friends.\n\nWith the release of the standalone version comes the chance for everyone to be a part of their own player driven history. While the MMO version has only a limited amount of resources and space for only so many cities and empires, this is not so for Unlimited. There's also the potential for mods and an ever increasing skill set for even more stuff to build and do in the game.  The possibilities truly are unlimited.\n\nWhile I hesitate to draw more comparisons to Minecraft, I think for the benefit of the layman it'd be fair to say something like: In Minecraft you can create a house and perhaps even a town in the span of a day; it's really not a big deal and even less of an accomplishment. In Wurm, when you crest a hill and find a city that is truly impressive, you can count on the fact that a lot of people were here and they worked very hard to create it. That itself lends appeal to people who find enjoyment in coming together and working to build something cool. And whether it's a lone shack in the middle of the woods or an epic castle that you've just completed, the satisfaction of striving to build something from nothing is what keeps people coming back.","November 14, 2015","true","39.6"," 74 of 81 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","74","81","4","0"

I am tending my fields of 2x potatoes, 2x cotton and 2x pumpkins, and have a willow fishing rod and fish in my tent (wondering if those will still be fresh when my 24hours noob buffs run out...)\n\nI have watched the first 4 episodes of Gamster4life`s 30minute Letsplays on Youtube and read a few articles on wurmpedia and completed the guides tasks in ...darn... the rightmost kingdom on the map, adventure mode...`twill come to me... no...no?

I`ve ... crossed paths with both the "small, common, young, un-fire-breathing, otherwise almost-cudly Hellhoud" and the "Young, but Huge, still as-far-as-can-deduce NOT Poisoinous spiderling". They could not be reasoned with. (Yeah, well, that could still be put on my account, really, pfft...) Whatever, I only survived by running back inside the fences of my kingdom town of... Jenn-something. There was no Jenn there, but I was still saved, even if I spent unecessary time missing her...\n\nThose experiences didn`t leave me ...  leave me ... without a... something...  *sigh* this is a blind sentence.\n\nI learned something from those utterly failed confrontations! YAY!\nThrough Wurmpedia and random alchemy ingame, I learned how to TREAT injuries with natural remedies and through FIRST AID via Cotton bandaging and I healed my wounds (faster than 368 hours of (realtime) waiting with untended wounds).\n\nI also gained a lot of skill in Shortsword and Shield.\n\nThose may have been cruicial when I met my next ... assail... attac... oppon... Aw, fcol MY NEXT ENEMY (maybe I was the agressor... awright gimmeabreak!)\n\nWe fought for several hou-minutes. I cannot truely say if it was five or ten minutes realtime, but I think it was at least three! I was blinded by colorful down and feathers most of the fight, but I remember my sword being blocked furiously by a nasty beak that hacked back at me with a ferocious ferocity unmatched by both the Hellhound and the Spider combined. I closed my eyes and put my shield in front of me, then swung my short sword futil...futuristically hithertoadfrom...or...something until I heard a loud cackle. The beakattacks subsided. I was able to look beyond the somewhat disturing carvings on the backside of the shield I was provided with at the start of the game and realised I had...\n\nWON MY FIRST BATTLE!\n\nI had deafeated a Young Rooster....\n\n...in less than 10 (3) minutes....\n\nyay, or something, or....\n\nWHAT A GREAT GAME!\n\nWhat an adventure,  and I haven`t even gotten started yet! The initial disappointment from having deafeated a mere rooster as my first enemy was somewhat consolidated by the fact that the Young Rooster Corpse weighed in at a sissily 15kg...\n\n*SHEESH* And I even BOTHERED to close my eyes!\n\nThere`s so much to learn, so many posibilities (and so much time to learn it in). The only CON would be if you DON`T like to spend A LOT of time in one (this) game, This game requires that you spend HOURS and not demand a lot of progresssion within the time spent to enjoy it.\n\nI enjoy it a lot, but games does not need to happen fast for me!\n\nI`m an Old-timer at the age of 44, in case that matters to you.\n","November 6, 2015","true","26.1"," 99 of 122 people (81%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","81","99","122","54","1"

Even from initial start point, you are basically under pressure to survive.

I like sandboxes and love them when they have the potential for long term persistent change.\nThis had some micromanaging at the start just to survive your first few nights. That in itself was extremely time consuming and difficult but I like a little challenge.\nMade a server, slightly inflated rates. Ok let's do this.\n\nI eventually found out this relationship wasn't going to happen.\nUser vs UI: You have to right click or go into menus for nearly everything. There is no left-click = use tool. You have to queue up several actions and your character statistics throttle this. It also doesn't help that the game has a built-in wiki that it encourages you to use for every single item.\nThere is no tutorial.\nFighting a wild cat of really low level took half an hour and 3 retreats to heal up. Even then the combat log was saying "barely poked" or "hardly scratched" which wasn't very reassuring.\nTrying to get started with the 'first night essentials' was taking the greater part of two hours.\nCould hardly make tools as you have a percentage based failure rate in proportion to low crafting skill.\n\nOn top of that Java loved to hang and crash.\n\nThis game is meant for a large persistent community with people religiously returning on a daily basis to get things done. You would only begin to experience what the game has to offer when you have a constant flow of over 16 people working together. There is no going lone wolf and expecting to get a small start to eventually bring people on or become accepted to a group. You need a team and you need people as a single person at starting rank cannot do anything within a reasonable time frame.\nTales of other players explain that they spent months or even years of repeated returns to the game just to spend a lot of time and feel 'rewarded'. It's at this point where the game seems more like a second job than just having fun for a little bit.\nSo for a short pick up and go this is definitely not the game you are looking for.\nIf you like convoluted UI with tons of clicking and days or weeks waiting from queued up actions then this is it.\n\nI don't mind a bit of a grind but this was way too much for my patience, so I can't recommend this title.\n","November 17, 2015","false","3.3"," 180 of 253 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","180","253","7","20"

The community in Wurm Online was always great, minus a few griefers here and there. It has one of the most in-depth crafting systems I have ever seen. And what makes it even better is that you can do anything you want to the world. Want to flatten that mountain or hill over there? Do it! (Although it might take you a while). Want to build a large canal connecting two bodies of water? You can do that! Want to convert a scorpion covered desert into a lush green forest? That can be done. This is probably the single most important reason I stuck with Wurm Online for so long.\n\nAnother thing I like about Wurm is the graphics. Yes, I know some of you are thinking "How can you like the graphics?".. But it's not so much about comparing it to current game graphics, obviously current graphics are superior. But that is something that gives this game character.\n\nThe next thing I want to talk about is the UI and controls. I've noticed a lot of people complaining about these, and I don't understand why it is such a bad thing. Yes, the UI might take a while to get used to, but once you get used to it, it isn't bad at all. Same goes for having to click and drag to look around. I understand most first person games do not do this. But once you get used to it, it isn't bad.\n\nLast thing I want to address is the learning curve. I will admit, it is very steep. But it can help a lot if you play with someone who knows how to play. When I first started Wurm Online, I think it took me over a week of playing to finally grasp most of the basic concepts. But I am glad I didn't give up, because it is one of the most fun and relaxing games to play in my opinion. So my advice to all noobs out there, don't give up just because it's hard. If you work hard and learn, it will be very rewarding.\n\nMy summary of Wurm Unlimited:\n\nPros:\n- Very relaxing.\n- In-depth crafting system.\n- Worlds are plenty large enough for a good amount of people.\n- You can host your own servers for solo/playing with friends.\n- You no longer need to pay for premium like in Wurm Online.\n- You can have full control over the server settings, such as no upkeep, skill gain, etc...\n\nCons:\n- For noobs, there is a steep learning curve.\n- There are some bugs that I have ran into, such as mounting/dismounting horses crashing my game.\n\nAll in all, this is a good game for those who are willing to spend some time working in the game. For those who aren't, you can join a server with higher skill gain. Hope this review helps! Have fun and see you in Wurm!","October 24, 2015","true","46.5"," 58 of 71 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","58","71","5","3"

I've been playing Wurm Online for several years now and I always joke that it is my "PvP Retirement Home," but truthfully even the PvP systems are well above and beyond most mainstream MMOs.  The ability to customize your server settings mean you can tweak your specific server to find the balance you want between epic PvE encounters and faction based PvP warfare.\n\nDedicated servers are able to handle upwards of 200 players spread throughout kilometers of land with the ability to link servers together.  One of the most interesting features of Unlimited is that you can link severs together as 'neighbors' in order to travel from one map to the other with the ability to set up Home Kingdoms for people to build themselves up on and then travel to open warfare servers via ship.\n\nWurm Online is one of the only games that allows such a wide freedom of construction options while tying in boats, siege weapons, taming, deep crafting, extensive wound systems, religions, factions and a whole lot more.\n\nThe biggest downside is the archaic feeling combat system, but it does make up for it in the complexity of the way combat is calculated and the wide spectrum of options to include mounted, ranged, melee, pets and siege warfare.\n\nThe graphics have also come a long way since the MMOs inception and the viewing distance can make for some epic landscapes and vistas.\n\nOverall, the game has a lot of depth if that is what you're seeking and if it feels intimidating there is an extensive series of documentation and tutorials available in the game itself.  While the animation and the flow of combat feels somewhat limited, the rest of the game creates so many more opportunities for a true sense of adventure and exploration.","October 22, 2015","true","104.4"," 34 of 44 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","34","44","0","0"

Small things like leveling an area for a home or building a fishing rod out of several parts feels like a real accomplishment.  The game is full of probably hundreds of things like that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peregrineomega/recommended/366220/","peregrineomega","Peregrine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peregrineomega/","328 products in account","I'm going to preface this review with the blunt honesty that this game will not be for everyone.\n\nIt has relatively dated looking assets and UI, and an almost crushingly steep learning curve that doesn't ease up within the first few hours of play. In fact, it may seem even MORE daunting after you play for an hour or two. If you've never played a hardcore MMO like Ultima Online or EVE, Wurm may seem frustratingly difficult to get started in. This is not Minecraft (despite Notch having been on the original dev team), nor is it anything like any other relatively casual crafting game.\n\nAll of those things being said... It is one of the best crafting RPGs I've ever played, hands down. The seemingly unending complexity, the vast array of items and creatures, the fully moldable landscape, and a skill tree to make an Elder Scrolls game seem casual; Deep hardly begins to describe it. Once you manage to get your hands on the reigns of this game's mechanics... there's no turning back. Suddenly you've carved an entire city into the side of a hill with a growing economy of entirely player controlled mechanics that provides a level of satisfaction unfound in most modern RPGs.\n\nIf you're looking for a truly hardcore RPG experience... look no further than Wurm.","April 16","true","407.2"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","0"

I should state that the majority of my playtime has been spent modding and testing mods, alongside experimenting with different gameplay settings. I have previously played the 'Online' MMO version for some four years pretty solidly (the game encourages recognisable addictive behaviour mechanics, not uncommon for 'grind' MMO's it must be said).\n\nFirstly, this game should not have been released in it's current state. I played WO for years and bought WU in the belief that it was a stand-alone, finished product. It is not. The game is terribly optimised for its level of graphical fidelity, mechanic systems are under constant review and tweaking from the developer, updates threaten to change or undo much of what you assumed was a complete feature or mechanic. What may have passed off as excusable in terms of interface and standards in 2005 is not acceptable here in 2016.\n\nThe game, such as it is, has been evolving as an MMO for the best part of 15 years, therefore for the stand-alone version to still be at the stage where features are yet to be completed (or even GUI elements such as icons) is beyond parody. The vanilla gameplay is slow, tedious and dull. The community is small, territorial and fractured. Combat is comcially lacking in player involvement. Modding is unreliable due to continuing development. The visuals are extremely dated, though not unbearable. Audio... I'm not even going to go there.\n\nIn this day and age there are far more complete, fun and competent survival games available for a cheaper price. Wurm Unlimited is far too late to the game with such a poor showing. As with the MMO, there was much promise and not enough on delivery.","February 13","false","152.9"," 58 of 88 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","58","88","2","2"

This game has been about so long parts of the terrain code were written by Notch before he left the project and later created minecraft. You can clearly see the influences that t left on minecraft too. Chopping trees, gaining resources, mining, defending yoursefl from enemies.\n\nThe big differences are the 3D graphics, the difficulty, and the levelling. The levelling is fabulously in depth, with over a hundred skills that you can level up. Want to climb a hill? Improve your climbing skill. Want to cook? Improve your cooking skill. Want to cook with dairy? Well, that's a seperate skill. Want to learn the yo-yo? Yep. There's a separate skill for that too.\n\nAnd the difficultly is insane. The free starter items make it somewhat easier, but you have to craft everything you need, and you have a chance of success. Want to make a mallet? Well, you need to chop a tree down, so that depends on your skill at that, then your skill at making the logs into shafts, the shafts into mallet heads, etc, etc. And if you're not good enough you can mess these steps up. And you can mess up putting the parts together. At low skill there are dozens of ways you can fail.\n\nOn top of that, it's one of the few games where you can get properly lost. It avoids the easy "You are here" that we're all used to, and you just have to remember which way you went. It's incredibly refreshing, and it really makes it seem like you're exploring. Taken in the context of when that design choice was made, several years ago, it really stood out. It feels like a more hostile world when you can really get turned around and lose your bearings.\n\nAt first, you may well die a lot. If you see a lion, you've got about the odds you'd expect if you really saw a lion. Not much chance. If you walk up a hill, you lose stamina. If you run out, you fall. Many early games of mine saw me killed by a moderate hill. Then again, maybe you'll run into a 20 foot tall monster who will just stomp you into non existance.\n\nThe building is incredibly involved, and you can make wonderful structures with the tools in game. Now you can create a standalone world, you can keep them safely stored without any worry of them ever being deleted. You can create your own city, level your skills, and know it's all safe for you to come back to if you have to leave it a while, and that's well worth the wait.","October 22, 2015","true","11.1"," 36 of 51 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","36","51","0","0"

Make a chest out of pine?  Meh. Make it out of cherry or apple? How nice!\nYou'll find yourself saving high quality cuts of different woods for specific purposes as you travel through the forest, or snipping sprigs from plants for planting back at home later. Don't get too comfy while you're out there raking your garden though. A young troll might wander out of the woods and turn you into dinner.\nAdventuring is really an adventure. Take a wrong turn and you can become fantastically lost.\nWurm is an epic game and the amount of detail is staggering. In my opinion it's second only to Dwarf Fortress in detail.\nSince Unlimited relies on private servers, I would stress that one carefully vet a server before committing to play there as weeks of work you put into your home could be undone in seconds by an immature admin.

I looked into it some more and became intrigued that this is a standalone version with the option of running it as a server for friends  / everyone or as a single player. The age of the game becomes fairly obvious when you see the graphics. They are a bit reminiscent of the earlier Gothic games.  The online game has been around for quite sometime so this is not a total surprise and once you look beyond that you can appreciate the depth there is in terms of content and gameplay. There is a ton of things you can change from the graphics to character levelling. This is a good thing as it means you can tailor the game to be how you want it.\n\nMy advice to those new to the game is to play the adventure mode and then speak to the NPC in the middle of the starter town. He will give you missions that will train you on how to do things. It won't take you long before you realise how simple it can be to combine items in order to create new things. The survival elements work well and its pretty easy to find what you need when in the wild. The interface contains a lot of information and its as easy as clicking or dragging to  customise it to your taste.\n\nThe levelling system works by increasing your skills the more you use them. This is great because it means your character will develop in style that you play. I'm sure there is many, many things I am yet to discover but so far the game has been both stable and interesting. If you were a fan of the online version then this is a no brainer. If not then still consider this because if you play with friends you can become the gamesmaster and weave events in the game. There is a creative mode as well for those who would rather spend their time building.","October 21, 2015","true","7.6"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","0"

I’m new and more than a bit shy so I tend to stay quiet but I can’t remain that way when it comes to Wurm Unlimited.\n\nI have been an avid RPer/MMO fan since the first version of Everquest and Asheron’s Call.  I worked on more than one game as a concept artist and graphic designer when the first big name MMO’s came into existence yet still, I have never found the game for me.  SWG was close until … well anyone who played it knows that hellish tale of woe.  When I could no longer find a complex game that offered world building and sandbox appeal, I went to Second Life.  I became a professional builder and even a GM for Linden Labs but I missed the old MMO’s.  Wurm helped me recapture that era once more.\n\nFirst, let me say this right up front, the game still needs work.  There are a few bugs that I am hoping they iron out someday and the graphics have glitches that need tweaking.  Considering that I am into graphic design, that’s probably just my O.C.D. kicking in.  I see a skin that doesn’t quite meet up correctly and my eye twitches.  The combat is awkward and the game itself doesn’t just have a learning curve, it has a learning cliff.  Please warn your friends not to give up too soon before they enter this game or you'll never hear the end of it.\n\nI have fallen in love with this game.  The depth of realism in the crafting and survival is amazing.  You walk into the world and in order to survive, you have to create everything from scratch but the way its set up makes sense.  If you want to fish, you need to make yourself a fishing pole.  You carve a fish hook or make it from iron you mined.  You create your own fishing line from cotton you gathered growing wild in the fields and you whittled the pole from branches of a fallen log.  From the smallest task like just finding enough food to eat to survive the winter or picking the right herbs to heal your wounds, all the way to creating a vast settlement with your friends, this game has it all.\n\nI was so impressed with the depth and freedom of the game that I have purchased a server and I’m hosting an RP world with some friends.  We are currently rebuilding the settlement towns and this reminds me so much of when I used to buy an island in SL and build a world for people to come RP in.  The best part is, instead of $150.00 a month, this island cost me a one-time fee of $30 bucks.  With the ability to mod and improve the graphics myself or with the help of others, this is the game world I have longed to play in.\n\nNow if you’ll excuse me, I am going to cut this short and head back in game.  If you see my husband, tell him I love him but I have so much to do…  so much to build...\n","February 27","true","101.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","17","20","6","0"

This is also not a pro-con-post.\n\nI now played this game for some time and I played WO in the past, but never really liked it due to the subscription and the really low skillgain.\n\nI think I made the right decision when I joined one of the bigger servers after a friend recommended it and had really no issue with the people on it. Yes there can be idiots, but you find them in all survival-ish and sandboxy games with community driven servers.\n\nOverall the community is nice, some are elitists but that's the minority.\n\nNow to the game: Since I knew WO, I knew how the interface is a bit clunky and can be overwhelming, but after taking some time it really is nice. Yes, you interact less with the world due to the submenus and stuff, but overall you get more out of it.\n\nWhat I see in most negative reviews is "I die to XY, it's a joke". Well yes and no. If you start out, your skill barely shows you where to hold the sword and not just grab it on it's blade. It takes practice to actually get used to it (as in real life, not as hard as in-game but it does). Best thing to do: Hit some trees to get the skill up and it will be easier.\nCombat isn't the strength of the game, and I never really saw it as main selling point - It is fun to go out there and kill stuff, but only with a few others or if you have the actual skill and high quality items to do so.\n\nThe main selling point is the sandbox. And I love it. You can terraform the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game (if you have the skill to do so), you can basically build your dream house, castle, town, whatever if you invest some time into skilling up the specific skills, which should be possible by creating the actual needed resources.\nRight now, we maintain a rather big town and there is always something to build or to help out.\n\nThe only downside is the advertised single-player. You can do it and it might be fun if you change the rates high enough, but overall it is not meant for single-player.\nAlso for the needed server: All claim they are having issues with it and I have no clue what they do. I went through the settings without any guide and just started it. Could connect without issues and it was only showing up on LAN.\n\nMultiplayer is as fun as it was in WO: Work together and not against each other, unless you are on a PVP server. But there are also Kingdoms.\n\nTL;DR: If you like a sandbox, that is not focussed around pve-combat and want to play with others and get over window management and older graphics, then this is the way to go.\n\nFor anyone eager to just try it, don't buy it. Go to Wurm Online, play there for a bit until you get some skills to the F2P level 20 skillcap and see for yourself. If you survive as long as that and you enjoy it, then get WU and play on the bigger servers.","November 6, 2015","true","54.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

This game gives you nothing, you will have to earn it. It's not that hard to figure out and you will love the rewards x10 compared to the other games that are now days making it to easy. No you wont get to power level. You cant buy your way in. Your gonna get dropped into a world face first with a compass and a few supplies to get you by. Its getting dark outside so you better run to a city. But wait, you hear a wolf growl from the bushes, you start to run but you are bitten in the leg. Turning your back WU gives the wolf a advantage since you turned. Secondly it not just , you took 23 damage please heal, oh no its WAY more detailed. Your gonna need to find some cotton and bandage that wound. But it also depends on where the wound is and what type. You see your right leg is bleeding out and infection is sure to come. This game is ok on graphics and fighting, but the hidden treasure is in the details. Theres a skill for everything you can think of, sometimes  branches of 2 to 3 skills for one thing. Anytime you make something, your skill effects the quality. You got to get to know people and trade, because you dont have npc shops that sell stuff, only venders owned by players. I'll have to say I am alittle spooked sometimes, the game seems to have some witchcraft in it. It has gods to choose from, altars, animal sacrificing,ect. You can also breed animals, groom them, tame them, sell them, eat them, ride them. Any trade you can think of is in the game and broken down into many parts and it wont be easy. But after you put in the time to be the best at that niche people start coming to you and buying. I went from rock bottom to having a nice little town in about 3 weeks. But in that time I dug dug and dug and my friends dug and we sold the dirt to some rich guy down the street. He needs the dirt for building. We started out with a little hand cart that carried 40 dirt a trip. After becoming friends with the guy, he built us a large cart and then a wagon capable of hauling 3600 dirt. We bought some land and hired some guards that now run around and kill those wolfs. I'd have to call it more of a simulator then a game.

It personally took me 3 days just to understand the basics(though I did this casually).\n\nBut If you can get passed the dated graphics, awkward UI(this is subjective), and steep learning curve(not subjective lol), you will discover a game where you... watch a progress bar half the time. Yet it is strangely addicting, immersive and even fun. I guess it is very peaceful, just minding yourself in the woods, building your little hut or digging to find that damn iron vein, while the ambient sounds of the enviroment immerse you in the world of Wurm.\n\nThe freedom the game gives you is unparalleled in my gaming experience. And I can say the same for the complexity and sheer variety of the crafting system. All this just adds to the immersion. Wurm is a harsh a tedious world, but that just makes the pay off that much more rewarding- I've never been so happy to complete a virtual 1x1 little wooden hut.\n\n8/10(disregarding the dated graphics and UI because the game is over 10 years old, but 7/10 for those who really care about that)","October 31, 2015","true","142.2"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Wurm Unlimited allows the hosting of private servers, meaning skill values, action timers,  and skillup rates can all be adjusted. With the addition of mod support, which is still in it's early stages at this point, the game could finally get to a point where I'd actually find it fun.\n\nIf you're unsure about buying this game, don't. Try the free MMO version, Wurm Online, first. It will give you an idea of how the basic game plays. From there you can easily figure what kind of changes you'd like to see in a server of your own in Wurm Unlimited.","November 1, 2015","true","57.3"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

I really do not write that many reviews but I will take the time to do It despite my terrible grammer.\nYes the graphics suck... I will not lie, but what makes people Including myself play Is the content. When I first started playing I got my @ss beat by a chicken not understanding the combat system. I have come to love the combat system and just the sh!t you can do. My son woulda been fatherless right now If I did not get the game for himself. This game has gods fighting for control of the heavens I mean come on now. Even though the Graphics Is outdated It really packs a punch baby!\n\nThings good about the game\n\n1) Make your own town and really micro manage It.\n\n2) Hosting your own server with the ability to set the parameters. You can Increase the skill gains or what you start off with so your not living a life in game Instead of real life.\n\n3) The crafting system has alot to offer. I mean from making the nails to making wells.\n\n4) Gods to follow or In the future become a god yourself. Battle In heaven and no matter what you do things are happening In your world.\n\n5) Epic creatures to fight. From dragons to sea monsters attacking you and your friends In your "what you thought was secure' giant ship.\n\n6) A In depth combat system allowing you to strick and disable parts of the victims body. Hell they even have traps and tons of em!\n\n7) The fact you can locally host your own server. (think I said this one already)\n\n8) The ability to claim land and protect It by hiring gaurds. Having to pay for upkeep keeps players busy.\n\n9) For those whom remembers Elder scrolls morrowind. Yeah B!tchs lock picking Is back.\n\n10) More adults play this cause childrens are afraid of numbers and menus that give you options.\n\n\n\nCrap that sucks...\n\n1) More host then players at times... Since everyone can host a server and the requirments to do so wont drain your computer everybody and there damn grandmas want to host a server\n\n2) Well... the graphics... Which Is cool with me. Hell I came from playing Elder scrolls morrowind during a time people had PS3's.\n\n3) Easily misunderstood combat system. Trust me once you learn It you will enjoy It.\n\n4) Host local server ONLY CONNECTING TO STEAM!!! The devs gotta take that S#!t off. You can only host If you first connect online to steam. SO If you and your son or something want to play without Internet you popped baby!\nFIX DAT SH#T DEVS!!!\n\nYea thats pretty much It...

It's a perfect solution for people who don't want to pay the monthly subscription and giving people the ability to run their own servers fixes the problems that Wurm Online had. The majority of the servers speed up the xp and building rate which is a god send since Wurm Online's xp rate was deathly slow which probably killed off the playerbase in the first place. And speaking of playerbase you now actually do have a ton of people playing. There are servers that have at least 100 people playing which really is a good amount for this type of game. Though I'm not sure if new players would enjoy this since the whole game is literally just grinding. But it's about the joy of progression and watching everything slowly coming together. It's just a good comfy game that you can multitask while playing.

But if you have the patience to learn, you'll be privy to the deepest sandbox experience available. There's a skill for everything: everything from bladesmithng and weapons head smithing, to toy making. You can change the land by terraforming... or sail to distant ones. Have the winds turn against you and be forced to tack to get where you are going. Build a bridge to nowhere or just explore what is around you already.\n\nIn Wurm you can interact with everything-water, the dirt, that bush, using either a right click menu, a selection bar, or many hundreds of hotkeys. This means that your "looking" has to be bound to the left mouse button. Many people are upset about this, and call it "clunky." Minecraft doesn't have this problem, they say. But Minecraft is a simple game, with only a few interactions: take, swing tool/weapon, fill bucket. But in Wurm you have literally hundreds of things you can do to tiles, objects, creatures, and plants depending on what you have active. This takes some getting used to, and there is no way you can get used to it in an hour.\n\nMy point is this: when people compain about the "UI" or "player interaction," they are actually complaining about the game's COMPLEXITY. They want a casual game, and Wurm is simply not that.\n\nRegardless! You don't have to pay a thing to try Wurm! If you are still concerned about the game's complexity (pointed to as a flaw by haters), or If you are not sure if it's for you, you may want to try the free version, just do a search for Wurm Online. Keep in mind, though, that WO is much slower paced than WU, but it will give you a good idea if it's for you.\n\nThings to consider:\n1. Combat in this game is in the style of Dungeons & Dragons. That is, it is die roll based. Monsters are provided to add additional challenges to your exploration, but this is primarily a crafting/exploring game. Some have described it as more of a Medieval simulator.\n\n2. If you play the slow version, it's important to know why it's slow. It's to encourage you to work as a team. This is to encourage realistic behavior in the players. Building a whole settlement should be a daunting task, and it is. If you decide to do it, you might get frustrated, but there is nothing like the feeling of finishing a grand building. The old expression is true: frustration fuels triumph.\n\n3. Not everything is completely realistic, but it would be almost impossible to have complete realism. Digging fencepost holes is no fun. What Wurm does, rather, is attempt to give the *feeling* of doing it without taking you through every single step.\n\nNB: This is a rough draft and shall be expanded.","October 22, 2015","true","52.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

I found this iron mined to it and then went outside for a bit. I returned to wurm unlimited when I got home and thats where I met a person new to wurm, his ingame name is Papadukes. He said he builds empires, and I wanted to see where this would go so I taught him how to play the game. Slowly but surley he wasn't lieing, now I am the mayor of a village containg over 10 other people. I did not expect this to happen when I met Papadukes on day one.\n\nMy main complaint about this game so far is when you open the settings, it opens behind the window, and even if you do change them, you will probably have to exit the game and reopen it then open settings before you connect to a server to actually change them, other than that I have been having a great time.","October 27, 2015","true","350.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I believe this game is one of the most in depth sandbox survival games there is and perhaps ever will be. Wurm may not have the most up to date graphics but for what it lack in graphics it makes up for in depth. This game is for people who are looking for a more in depth game experience, chopping a tree  may take a few strikes with your axe and therefore take a moment to cut down but the game was shooting for more realism in that aspect and because of the time it takes to actually build things and gather the resources required to build things it makes it far more rewarding when you have completed building something.

Wurm Unlimited is the private-server version of that great game, which allows you to set up your very own server or play on servers that other players like you have set up. A lot of the things are immediately custumizable, such as skill gain, action timers (time it takes you to craft, build, terraform etc.), farming timers and a whole bunch of other stuff through an ingame item called a wand, which you receive when you make yourself a GM.\n\nWurm Online's main complaint had always been the time it takes to do stuff. After the price hike many people were also unable to pay for the game's steep price. Wurm Unlimited solves both of these issues, as you can customize the game in any way you want to. Wurm Unlimited is also a one-time payment, which means you won't be paying anything besides the initial price of 25 euros (or an equivalent to that, depending on your country and currency).\n\nThe possibility of creating mods is also there, although I must admit I am disappointed in the lack of documentation regarding this. I have however understood that there is a certain community working on creating a framework for modding.\n\nOverall, great game.

It gave you the building and terraforming ability of Minecaft, the POTENTIAL (we'll get to this in a minute) ability to work together with friends, and a leveling-by-using skill system. So, you can build your own hideaway, town, or whatever, you still have to survive (and stuff in here's deadly!), and you forge your own path on what you're going to develop.\n\nBUT. Frickin' but. We have tried, so very hard, my friends and I, to host a server and have them see it, and to have them run a server so we can see it. We're no slouches in hosting servers. We cannot see each other, and the boards seem to suggest this is a real craps shoot. That's not how multiplayer and servers should be.\n\nBecause it takes out the interactive element that really makes it enjoyable, for now, I cannot recommend this game. I may change it if Wurm takes steps to address this.","December 16, 2015","false","5.0"," 76 of 140 people (54%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","54","76","140","7","10"

Loving the idea and playing it however are 2 very different things.\n\nSo in short i went from hyped to desperately wanting to get rid of it in a matter of 1.5 hours of trying it. Here is why:\n\nGraphics are ugly but i could deal with it if the rest was nice enough\nWorld interaction is clumsy and boring, its menus over menus over menus, clicking repeatedly an action to cut 1 single tree ergo boooooring\nInteracting with NPCs is unintuitive and feels disconnected. Everything happens in a chat and in a status window. Other games solve that much more intruiging and engaging.\nNow for technical problems: i do have a rather big 4K Monitor and the UI for this just released title cant handle it. Its unreadably small, and even though text size can be changed it helps nothing, nada, niente...(nice feature btw: here change your font size user...result: just kiddiiiiing...)\nSlowpaced and boring, getting into the game just doesnt feel like i am the one doing stuff and dont get me even started on the fighting. Whoever invented that system must be out of work and bored to death with the rest of his life so he can enjoy sitting in front of a young chicken for 5 minutes while you exchange attacks with it. Comeon a freakin chicken takes 5 minutes to kill with a sword? really?\nNothing is intuitive, you have to guess what you can do. Wanna do something with that nice piece of wood you got there? Well figure it out which of your numerous tools does what to it, try and error. This could be done so much easier but i guess Wurm just loves its deep textmenu interaction style.\n0/10 would never attack a chicken with a sword again and waste 5 minutes of my life waiting for it to die while receiving numerous wounds. da ♥♥♥♥?!?!\n\n\n\n","October 23, 2015","false","1.7"," 122 of 228 people (54%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","54","122","228","27","12"

What Code Club AB / Rolf says goes, and that's sad because there's a lot more to this game that could be there and arguably should be but isn't.\nThis is the answer, and is definitely worth playing if you either A) know how to host a server, use all the tools and mods at your disposal (or create your own, even better) to make it something that's not just worth playing but a GREAT game, or B) know a server that does that all.\nI play on Razor's Edge and I'm extremely pleased with it. Frankly I'd pay the sub fee for WO if Rolf was more like Razor; but I'm looking at WU as being Razor's Edge buy-to-play. Great staff, lots of cool stuff going on in the background, fantastic map design, quests, treasure and dungeons and such.. it's pretty ridiculous. If you're interested in checking that out, go take a look at http://razors-edge.enjin.com/ - whatever links and info you might want is pretty readily accessible there and at the forums (add forum to the end of that link).\n\nBut I've also played on my own server, hosted by a professional server hosting company, with a friend.\nWurm is for a certain kind of person, and though that niche is very small, it's definitely holding me through while I wait for Chronicles of Elyria.\n\nWurm Unlimited was the move that Code Club AB needed to make. It is what you make of it. If you have the thirty to spare, and don't mind basically playing a MUD/MUSH game with graphics, give this a shot.","June 1","true","157.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Well 175 hours as I write this review.\nIt does take a bit of time to figure out how to achieve things but after a while you soon get it and find yourself enjoying the experience.\n\nI find that treating this as a game where you spend time initially surviving and then finding yourself thriving as you build your home / village up and spend time making various items and improving the quality of them as high as you can so you can sell them to the traders scattered around.\n\nThe silver you make will then be enough money to pay for your deed and guards, if you have any, and then to keep paying the upkeep costs of the deed as, if you fail to do this, your village will eventually disband and decay away if you dont manage to keep up with the payments.  This wont happen too quickly though if you do find youself away for a while.\n\nThere is combat as well, both against the animals and other various creatures in the environment as well as other people if you venture onto the pvp lands.  Its a bit you hit them then they hit you but your clothing / armour / weapons and elevation etc all help to decide the result of these battles.   You can normally get to pvp enabled lands via a boat from the pve lands so whatever your prefered gamestyle there is something here to suit you.  Having said that the pve area's tend to have the most people playing .  I think f you approach this in the right way through then pvp its a fun diversion and a good use for all that armour and weaponry you will have built for yourself.\n\nI guess this wont be for everyone, but if you are unsure then trying out wurm online itself is free up to level 20 on your skills.  If you want to get those skills to 99 though you will either need to buy this version for a one time fee and play on the free servers (or create your own) - Unlimited tends to be a slightly speeded up version of the game as your skills can increase more rapidly and other actions like growing crops can be speeded up.\n\nOr if you want the full experience then subscribe to wurm online itself.  Its been going over 10 years and has a loyal following.\n\nOverall I find this to be good fun.  I am going to log in again myself now and work on improving the cloth puppet toys I am making.  I find they normally sell quite well if they are high enough quality.... then I guess the pigs will need tending.... I also need more iron.... see ya!","March 19","true","238.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You can claim property, tame wild-life, farm, and build a village to a city with impunity; anything from boats, ships, transportation carts, pavement, defenses, tools, weapons, armor, houses, etc.\nOne might be initially mentally blocked due the graphics, but if you put deep and rich game-play and game-play mechanics ahead of that, then this is worth the look.\n\nMany very dedicated private server owners are ex-Wurm Online players, and they are there for the long-term.\n","October 26, 2015","true","349.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Because of how complex it is to make a "simple" item, such as a crate, everything you accomplish truly feels like an accomplishment, and the objects that you create have a great deal of permanence and pride associated with them.\n\nOn many servers, there are no pre-set "quests" to go out and do. Your level of enjoyment is purely dictated by goals that you set for YOURSELF, not goals set by NPCs.\n\nIn addition to this, there is a solid system set in place to start a village with your friends, and on certain servers, expand that to a kingdom if you have enough followers.

If you are impatient or like things done quickly, this game is not for you. By design everything takes time to do, and that is what makes it rewarding.\n\nWurm Online is one of the best sandbox games in the world, but I am one who does not like monthly subscription fees and believes that players should be the ones to host servers. For me Wurm Unlimited is a step in the right direction. The dedicated server was surprisingly easy to get set up and I had mine up and running about 45 minutes after the game launched on steam.\n\nThe actual gameplay is just as slow as Wurm Online, this is a plus in my book, but can be tweeked to speed up the skill rates. The game runs smoother than I was expecting and I have not had any real issues with it at all. If you are looking for a game in which you feel like you are actually building a house wooden plank by wooden plank, this is your best option. It is also great for those who like PvP or fighting powerfull monsters.","October 22, 2015","true","80.8"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","5"

So, steep learning curve-you betcha. This will be more for the novices like me. If I can do it anyone can. This may not be for everyone. It's NOT x-box or PS4 it's much more. If you notice, the negative reviews came after only playing 2 or even .5 hrs. In all fairness, you can't get a true feel of a game of this complexity in such a short time.\n\nLikes:  This is an awsome game. I think the graphics are very good-again not ps4 but wait till you see your first baby lamb or foal you breed, they're sooo cute. From the realistic clouds,thunderstorms w/lightning bolts to the snow flakes in winter, it's all good. Some say the game play is to slow, I disagree. Working to improve your skills so that you can build say, a row boat (which is invaluable by the way) gives you a greater appreciation for where you started and where you are now. It also addes to the angst when going up against a nasty old bear, knowing you might loose the tools you worked so hard to make and improve and some of your skill gain if the bear kills you. I even feel my heartbeat quicken with the uncertainty of the outcome - now that's game immersion. I'm just now getting into the community aspect of the game, pretty sure I'll like that. I caught an 11.02 kg catfish yesterday and wanted to compare notes w/my fellow wurmians on their biggest fish.\n\nNuts & Bolts: as I understand them.  1st, Wurm Online-has existed 10+ yrs. Has official deticated servers that will probably never be shut down or wiped to play on-this is a plus.  It has deed costs and upkeep costs payable with "in game" money (silver coins) which you purchase at the "wurm online store" or earn selling goods or services to other wurmians. Please bare w/me. You also must purchse "premium time" if you want to raise your skill level above 20.\n2cd,  Wurm Unlimited - basicly plays the same as wurm online but w/these differences.  You purchase the game upfront. Once installed you have 3 ways to access a server/severs to play on,                                                                            1 - the game comes with the ability to manage yout own lan server. This is fairly easy to set up, although I had to go to a link with step by step instructions (remember NOVICE) and it connects thru steam so you have to have an internet connection. Does'nt have to be great, I'm playing on DSL.  You can password this server so only your friends can join you or open it to the public. You can adjust certain aspects of game play like - up to 10 x skill gain. This is simply-you will get 10x the skill gain for the action you are performing as oposed to the original wurm online. Lastly I believe there is a spirit templer (deed guards) mantainence cost according to how many you have. Again not sure but my settlement info says there is.                                                                                                                                                                                          2- You can manage your server offline. This is harder to set up - I don't know how but there are no costs and you will be the only one in this world.\n3- You can play on someone elses server if it's open to the pubic or you have the password, It may or may not have upkeep costs, it's up to the host of the server.\n\nDislikes:  Not much in the way of clear and concise information on what the game is or how to set up it's different capabilities or the true costs. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the upkeep costs, yes it's a revenue stream but the hosts equipment that stays on 24/7  - 365 has cost too. Plus it keeps 3 people from deeding the entire map. I still have'nt figured out how to fund my settlement that's about to be disbanded for the second time due to lack of funds, hosted by a gaming website server. Maybe it's my own ignorance but if the information was readily available I would have found it by now and there lies the source of my frustration.  I will persevere, remember - if I can do it ANYONE can. Hope this helps.\n\n\n","May 21","true","917.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It may look a bit dated, but you're free to build and craft an terraform to your hearts content. I'm focusing on farming and cooking while other players on my server focus on combat or smiting.\nIt should be noted that the best way to play this game is not solo, it's with other players.

It is now March 12th, 2016 and I have 56 hours under my belt.  Here's what I've learned...\n\n* Wurm Unlimited (which is based on the Wurm Online MMORPG) is a masterpiece of a game.\n* It hands nothing to you (except basic tools).  You must work for everything.\n* Something you think will take 5 minutes ends up being 4 hours, because you can't stop playing.\n* Looting is a non-issue on servers that don't allow thievery.  Lock your stuff up and it's safe.\n* It's a massive game world.  You can go anywhere.\n* The world is so beautiful and the landscape so extreme that you'll be in awe time and again.\n* The graphics settings available are insane.  You can adjust everything.  I cranked it with my 970 GTX.\n* The game loads quick and it runs great.\n\nThis game is something you can really sink your teeth into and take your time.  It's so rich in depth.  You'll be finding hidden gems (game mechanics) that'll blow your mind; that they thought to add such things into the game.\n\nComing from almost 500 hours in Rust and being tired of the same old formula (build up, log off, come back later to find you've been looted to oblivion), Wurm Unlimited is like a breath of fresh air.\n\nWord to the wise.  If you're expecting instant gratification, don't buy this game.  If you're not ready to put long hours into Wurm, this game isn't for you.  There is no one to hold your hand.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a meat and taters and seconds... no... heapin' helpins... aw hell, the whole cow and the whole potato field, this game is for you.\n\nUPDATE:  I've now spent 245 hours in Wurm Unlimited.  I have my own settlement (Perry on Mythmoor).  The depth of the game is such that it still has much to reveal for me. I'm reaching halfway on my skill levels (50) and I have only scratched the surface.  If you give it a chance, you'll find it addicting and a pure joy to play.  Since everyone is on the server for enjoyment, most are friendly and helpful and become your (new) friends and neighbors; socializing happens naturally.  I assume I'll be spending another 245 hours in Wurm Unlimited.  Probably way more.  In a nutshell, BUY IT!.  Still on the fence?  Look at my screenshots, watch some videos first.\n\nWurm Unlimited is like a sponge, it'll sap your life from you.  The real world will cease to exist or at the very least become a haze you walk through to get to your next login.","March 7","true","647.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So I did not encounter a learning curve when I tried Wurm Unlimited (WU). So for me the transition was smooth and effortless. The rewards I saw for stepping into WU where everywhere, beginning with modifiable skill gain helping to make the advancement of skills easier all the way to having ultimate GM powers. The server setup was simple and intuitive in my opinion. There is currently a lot of forum activity and advice if you do get stuck and need help. The overall WU experience was extremely positive for me.\n\nThat being said, Wurm is truthfully not for everyone, but for those that can get by the learning curve of the vast crafting system and want to create a world around you from your own imagination the rewards are great. Now with WU you can play with friends or decide to go it alone. Like I said before the extensive Wurm community is there to help when you need it or you can try working things out on your own if you enjoy more of a challenge.\n\nI cannot say enough about this game, challenging, addicting, rewarding, seemingly limitless ability to create and change the world to suit your own pleasure. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that wants to create and build, explore (careful out there, you could get eaten) or just rest and relax in the ambiance of your own created village, Wurm has it all if you are willing to spend some time to find it.\n\nMy recommendation would be if you are unsure of whether this game is for you, try it first with Wurm Online, it is free to play. That way you get a feel of what Wurm has to offer before you jump in and buy it.","November 10, 2015","true","130.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And you're completely free to kill, steal and destroy (on PvP maps) as long as you're not afraid of being hunted down.\n\nIt's a great game to play with friends or for joining an existing group.","January 14","true","555.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

One of the original devs was Notch from Minecraft and this is kinda like that but not voxel and it has physics with a fully editable enviroment, You can make custom maps if you want your own server and the map size on the server I play on, let's just say it is a 5 hour round trip from spawn and back to my house by boat. Sure the graphics are a bit dated but the game originally came out in 2006ish as Wurm Online and was an MMORPG but the game has been given a few new graphics and when you buy Wurm Unlimited you get the whole game with no monthly payment. The game has so much more to offer than most game of this type when you get into it and if you don't believe me, look on Wurmpedia and see all the aspects that go into the game. This game also has next to no bugs and works great, also remember to edit your graphics for a better looking game in the menu.

I am now back with Wurm Unlimited and I must say I have missed this game. I have searched for other sand box games and this is only one that has ever satisfied all the things I want to do. Dying in a remote forest after going on a hunt and losing all my best gear as I couldn't find my body is still one of my most memorable moments. This game is so huge and so real in terms of its medieval setting that I had no map and had no way of locating my body. Seems harsh but then this game doesn't hold your hand. You get a small helping hand for a day or so and then you are truly on your own. No other game comes close to how this game makes you feel (and I have looked).

I appreciate that this game requires effort like older games did once upon a time. I appreciate that you can't rush (well you can if you use the GM tools) because if there's one thing I've learned after many many years of gaming is that I've gotten bored when the games became easier. I remember in the original Everquest when it took half of a real day to make a journey to one of the major towns.  I am grateful that Wurm Unlimited brings that back to me because I've learned that is what I loved about gaming in the beginning.

Its seemingly got loads of content, but at the same time feels very empty. For example, you can make buildings out of rock. Specifically rock shards. But you can't make buildings with slate, clay, marble, or any other "special" material. Everything ends up basically looking the same, and while I know the process of building and maintenance is a selling point it just takes SO LONG to do anything that half the time I get bored with an idea before I'm even halfway through with it.\n\nStill its a very cool sandbox builder with a surprisingly large and more-welcoming-than-Online's community.

If you like quick fix builders like Minecraft or Terarria you'll want to look elsewhere.","November 3, 2015","true","166.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If you want to start building a castle and be done in a few hours, this game is not for you. If you however like to invest time into a game because you enjoy the satisfaction of working hard on something and enjoying the fruits of your labor than this game is perfect for you. Here is an example of building the most basic of carts to haul your stuff around.First you have to cut trees down and chop them into logs. Then you have to use carving knives and saws and hatchets to make all the parts. You have to make each wheel, finish the wheel with wooden shafts and planks. Then you have to attach the 2 wheels together on an axel. Then you have to craft the body of the cart by making wooden pegs and planks and shafts and putting them all together in the right order. Some parts may need to be built alone and then attached. After its finished you can improve its overall quality with tools like files and pelts. My first cart took a few days to make. I would recommend this game to anyone not looking for a high paced building sim. I have never found a game so detailed in the things that must be done to survive.\n\nI played wurm online for a while and decided it was just to much money to spend every month. Then you have the pressure of either playing or wasting your monthly fee. This works the way minecraft works in that you buy the game and host your own server or join someone else's server. There is a list of servers running so it is easy to join a server already running. If you want to play with lots of people on the official wurm servers you have to get Wurm Online and pay monthly.","January 5","true","341.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

It is extremely realistic and offers a lot of fun to those that like Minecraft and playing other RPGs like Runescape etc.\n\nOne thing I will mention is that it is quite slow paced. even with adjustments to the settings, you won't find yourself building a house for a while. You first need to find Iron and other materials which can be a real pain. Don't download this game if you are inpatient or if you're expecting to be able to create a city immediately. Download this game if you're prepared for the possibility that you might not even build the first wall of your house for the first 10-15 hours.\n\nDefinitely recommend for anyone patient enough!","February 27","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fact it was written in Java is astounding to me just because of how diverse the game is. And now the fact that you can spend a one-time amount, download the software, and then connect to other people's servers. This is a great business and game model. The server I play on has a world chat (as I am sure most do) and the general feel is that everyone in-game are part of one big guild. It is refreshing to have such a positive in-game culture, on top of an already fun game.","February 23","true","56.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played Wurm Online before and this is more or less the same thing. It is nice to be able to customize settings (such as XP gain) and host a private server for myself and friends. I run a dedicated server on Linux but play the game on Windows. My only beef is that I am not allowed to run the server on Linux through Steam and play the game on Windows through the same account. It is basically telling me I am already playing a game. The fix though is to run the server outside of Steam, it still works just fine so no big deal.","May 27","true","111.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can take a massive role in the world you play in, conquer opposing kingdoms, wage epic wars against other people, or you can play the role of a simple farmer/smith who provides tools, food and equipment to the heroes of your kingdom.  As alot of people have already stated, this is really a complete sandbox experience with an actual living world. The "unlimited" version of the game is still bit rough around the edges (mainly in the launcher), but to me, a veteran WO player, having the ability to host your own massive online realms makes this one of the greatest games ever. And as far as graphics goes... if you have the power, WU can look absolutely beautiful if you tweak it a bit. (custom AA, textures, GUI, sweetFX ect). Hoping to see some amazing Workshop creations for this game at some point.","October 27, 2015","true","609.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Driver405/recommended/366220/","Driver405","Driver405","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Driver405/","205 products in account","First off, I will say that this game is not for everyone, and If you have never played Wurm Online, then I'd recommend to try it before you think about buying Wurm Unlimited.\n\nI started playing Wurm Online sometime in late 2009/early 2010, and I loved it. However, I did think the grind was a bit too harsh, and eventually I couldn't afford to pay for premium anymore, so I quit playing. I moved on to other games, the most similar being minecraft, but nothing ever came close to Wurm for me, so I ended up logging back in every few months/years to see what's changed, but never sticking around for long because I couldn't get premium.\n\nNow they have released Wurm Unlimited, a stand-alone, one-time payment version of the MMO, and needless to say, I was really looking forward to getting it. It's basically what I've always wanted Wurm to be, a one-time payment version that lets you do everything the game has to offer without limitation, and even lets you play on other people's servers, or even your own.\n\nNow I guess I'll put a list of Pros/Cons.\n\nPros:\n1. A true Sandbox game that lets you do whatever you want, wherever you want, now at your own pace since you can modify the speed at which you do things and gain skill levels.\n2. Everything is made by the players.\n3. Hundreds of different skills and thousands of items you can craft.\n4. Maps can be gigantic, don't expect to see many people come to visit you if you manage to build somewhere on the other side of the map :P.\n\nCons:\n1. Very large learning curve, this game is NOT noob friendly, this may be a pro to some, but if you expect to have you hand held, you will be dissapointed (unless you get into a nice village that will help you out).\n2. Graphics are pretty dated, though you can still find some places with beautiful views.\n3. Still has a few bugs, I haven't run across anything game breaking though, mostly just stuff to do with animations and stuff.\n4. Not sure if a bug or not, but as of the time of this review, you can't play without internet access. It isn't a big deal for most, but some people may be thinking of buying this so they can play when they are without an internet connection. As of right now, you cannot.\n\n\nSo, if you tried Wurm Online and liked it, but thought the grind was too painful, don't want/can't pay for premium, or you just don't like MMO's and jsut want to play by yourself or with close friends, then you will most likely enjoy Wurm Unlimited. If you have NOT played Wurm Online, and Wurm Unlimited sounds interesting to you, please try Wurm Online first, it's free to try out. Don't complain in the forums or something about it cause you bought the game without researching it.","October 27, 2015","true","336.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Unlimited allows you to do everything WO does at whatever server settings you please.\n\nTo new players:\nThis is a game of years. Pay once play forever. It's hard to describe Wurm but, if you are the type of person who is tired of arcadey games that quickly lose meaning, give this a try. If you think this game is too grindy, remember, it's all about how you play. There are so many things to do and you choose the settings to play them at. This is the whole point of WU. Your settings, your enjoyment.\n\nThe dedicated server is really light weight, and has a GUI to set everything up. Give this game a chance it will grow on you.","November 7, 2015","true","447.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

(Soon to be a heavily modified version). This is the first step in creating a game that Razor and various friends have been working toward for over 10 years. Although the game is based on WU, at some point it will no longer be Wurm as many know it, but will become Ages of Urath.\n\nThis will be an ongoing migration, and will not happen all at once. There will not be a server wipe to create Ages of Urath.\n\nAges of Urath will include political, economic, religious, warfare and lore systems that don't exist in Wurm, or really in any other game today. It is intended to be the richest online gaming experience possible.\n\nAges of Urath is about people and the stories that they make. The game design will support this by providing mechanics that bring people together, to get them interested in some common goals, to scare them, delight them, ♥♥♥♥ them off, get them riled up, make them laugh, and watch some of them overcome all obstacles and succeed in ways they never expected.\nGreat solid code, easy to mod engine.   Able to create massive multi map worlds.     We love it!!\nwww.razors-edge.org","March 22","true","330.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It can be sometimes annoying to learn the ins and outs if you are playing solo or with a few newbie friends since you cannot just ask your question into chat, so be prepared for possible growing pains early in the learning curve. The Steam forums will provide the answers you need if you become confused about how to proceed or what to do. If you enjoy building / crafting games in general, this is likely to be a good title for you. It seems well-optimized and does not require a top of the line computer to max out the graphics settings, allowing you to play in a visually satisfying world.\n\nThe game ships with 2 separate modes, creative and adventure. Creative is a blank canvas of a world, and Adventure has a storyline with Kingdoms and NPCs established around you. You can create your own server and password protect it so that only your invited friends can play with you, or you can join another player's server if you prefer. You have full control over the settings that determine the percentage of aggresive creatures in your world, or the timer for how long your crops take to mature, as well as GM abilities to modify or create objects.\n\nUnlike the online version with its monthly fee, it is a good title for those who have demanding schedules or varied interests, since you own the product and can return to it at will. It is said that the further development of the game will follow the development of the online version, so that updates and patches will become available.\n\nBuilding / crafting games are, by their very definition, a lot of work to make all the creations that you want. If you understand that at the start, then this is a rewarding title with much satisfaction to be gained from it.\n","November 3, 2015","true","170.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

WU defaults are already hugely faster than the original online version.\n\nKeep the survival aspect of this crafting world-builder. Enjoy the journey, not the end. You have an entire world, unlimited characters to put in it, built in LAN support (Manage Server) or can download the Steam Wurm Dedicated Server from the Tools tab and invite the whole world of Steam players to play, build and craft in your world...or join their servers.\n\nIt can be as casual or hardcare as you like it. The crafting and terraforming are complex and multi-layered. Aggressive creatures are unforgiving, and the world is huge.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nuemt/recommended/366220/","Nuemt","PK Everdeen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nuemt/","95 products in account","Overall Rating: 8/10 Fajitas\n\nWurm Unlimited is a descendant of Wurm Online, a game created by Code Club AB, and the original hearth to Minecraft. (Notch was apart of this team at one point)  This game, for its age, seems superior to other games that try to mimic or hold the ideals that WO(WU) has.\n\nPROS:\nExcessive amounts of freedom\nIncredibly manipulative for a game so old\nRuns easily\nGame is good for hobbying instead of full on no-lifing.\nHas a medieval sense of style, if you like that, you might like this.\nLots of things to build and make.\n\nCONS:\nCan be slow depending on your game mode.\nAction Timers, Action Timers everywhere!\nLots of Formulas.\nLackluster fighting\nAdministrative commands can be iffy.\nGUI is clunky. Based heavily on boxes all over the screen.\nGameplay early on is horrendous.\nPrivate Servers that go up and down constantly make time-related actions (Breeding, Farming) harder to do.\n\n... Now why?\n\nWurm has always had a soft spot in my heart, since i'm largely a hobbyist, this is one of those good games. You sit down for a bit, watch some Netflix, and chill; For a new player though, they might come across this game expecting to quickly jump into everything. The learning curve is large, and can almost kill the fun if someone is too slow to recognize what they have to do. Playing lone is nearly impossible as a newbie, but the point of WU is to still have your 'family', or a village to make or join. Where the community comes into play, the game gets better.\n\nCommunities usually keep the game interesting, someone to talk to along with some drama can certainly lighten up your day. Doing the missions, running around fighting unique monsters, and screaming and yelling as you murder other players are all somewhat community based activites that can be fun, or just straight up challenging.\n\nThis game is a standout from today's releases. Only one other game has tried its hand so well into WU's style, and considering it was made to try and outdo it. WU holds its own. The graphics might be bad, the gameplay might be a bit clunky at times, but it can keep you interested for hours if you find the littlest hint of something you might like. Watching those numbers go up? Makes you feel like a king once you get high up there.","October 25, 2015","true","94.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"

If you like to work your way from nothing building up a multitude of skills then crack on with it, the satisfaction alone will have you hooked.  Graphics are quite breathtaking, it can be played as a stand alone and you are King of all you survey or you can join one of the many dedicated servers and join other like minded building enthusiasts in creating a Utopian society, I would advise the latter as even a self confessed addict like me enjoys the break from the boredom that comes with the community chat.  I will not go on about the game play since it isn't really rocket science, mine, dig, build create, upgrade and sell or buy.  Joining a server gives you the option to concentrate on a particular set of skills and barter with other players or as I do just get on and do it yourself.  Many times I have thought " That's it I have had enough!!!!" but each time I am drawn back in with the old "Well I could just finish that ship routine"  Is it worth the time and effort?  Maybe not but I still play anyway, if you have a life this game probably wont suit you but there again who knows,  In short try it and see.","January 20","true","116.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I always felt my creativity was limited by the need to gather resources and put more time into making it real than I could give.\n\nWurm Unlimited has changed that for me, and yet still offers so much more. Not only can I use a GM-level character to build anything I desire, but I can run a server and share it with my friends. The community has already created some wonderful tools that allow you to make custom maps, and the modding community is just getting started.\n\nThe game is rather easy to launch and manage for most people. Each "server" is in it's own folder, so I can easily make copies, zip up the good ones and store them for later, or switch between if I goof up too badly. There's a Linux-based dedicated server for cheap, cost-effective hosting.  (Server going on a $20/mo Linux VPS)\n\nThat doesn't even touch the Adventure mode, which allows a player who has never played Wurm get a real feel for some of the aspects that even MMO players never really experience. You get to work on ascending to godhood, to gain powerful sorcery items, or do what ever! Totally up to you. It's what I'd like to call "rails-optional"\n\nI know some folks have had a hard time running the game, but those issues seem to be more related to hardware and software set up than anything else. Windows 10 64-bit, with the latest Java installed, nVidia GTX 960, 16GB of RAM running on my old Athlon FX chip and the game and server both run flawlessly. (I even play Wurm Online AND Wurm Unlimited at the same time usually.)\n\nIf there's any downside I can think of, it's that this isn't the type of game for everyone, though Wurm Unlimited does allow you to tailor it more to your play style. There's a learning curve, but sites like http://www.wurmpedia.com are there to help get past that.\n\nAll in all, I'd buy it again (right after I re-up the subscriptions on my four accounts on Wurm Online)","October 28, 2015","true","295.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Yes, there are some issues, and a decent learning curve, but it's very worth it. I'm currently hosting a server for me and a couple of other friends, and we are all addicted. It's very easy to choose to live peacefully in the middle of nowhere or to go exploring for new lands and treasure. At first, I was very put off by the control scheme, but a little "Google-fu" helped to fix any issues I had. Currently, I have 37 hours in the game, and that was all in a four day span. Another bonus for me, as the father of three kids, is that I can walk away from the game at almost any point and not have to worry about what happens while I'm dealing with real life.

It's Wurm online without the fees!\nI loved Wurm online but i'm more of a causal player so i couldnt justify the constant money drain.\nNow, the game has a steep learning curve and you need to learn it to enjoy the game, the graphics arnt the best but after awhile you will see the beauty in the graphics.. its odd you start to think this is so amazing looking. I think its your Imagination, that takes hold as you need to plan your life, your house, your land as you can plan every aspect in this game.\n\nNew players NEED to read and follow the newbi guides wiki, otherwise you will probably give up.\n\nSaying all that, the only thing I dont like at the moment is that your at the mercy of the server host.. you start on a server that looks to be stable, has a domain with forums etc, spend a few hours digging.. you come back the next day and the server is gone.\n\nThis game will take over my already far too busy life..

I always felt my creativity was limited by the need to gather resources and put more time into making it real than I could give.\n\nWurm Unlimited has changed that for me, and yet still offers so much more. Not only can I use a GM-level character to build anything I desire, but I can run a server and share it with my friends. The community has already created some wonderful tools that allow you to make custom maps, and the modding community is just getting started.\n\nThe game is rather easy to launch and manage for most people. Each "server" is in it's own folder, so I can easily make copies, zip up the good ones and store them for later, or switch between if I goof up too badly. There's a Linux-based dedicated server for cheap, cost-effective hosting.  (Server going on a $20/mo Linux VPS)\n\nThat doesn't even touch the Adventure mode, which allows a player who has never played Wurm get a real feel for some of the aspects that even MMO players never really experience. You get to work on ascending to godhood, to gain powerful sorcery items, or do what ever! Totally up to you. It's what I'd like to call "rails-optional"\n\nI know some folks have had a hard time running the game, but those issues seem to be more related to hardware and software set up than anything else. Windows 10 64-bit, with the latest Java installed, nVidia GTX 960, 16GB of RAM running on my old Athlon FX chip and the game and server both run flawlessly. (I even play Wurm Online AND Wurm Unlimited at the same time usually.)\n\nIf there's any downside I can think of, it's that this isn't the type of game for everyone, though Wurm Unlimited does allow you to tailor it more to your play style. There's a learning curve, but sites like http://www.wurmpedia.com are there to help get past that.\n\nAll in all, I'd buy it again (right after I re-up the subscriptions on my four accounts on Wurm Online)","October 28, 2015","true","295.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yojinko/recommended/366220/","yojinko","Hijal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yojinko/","28 products in account","This is my first negative review, and I also believe that a review, good or bad, should be justified and explained so I'm going do that instead of writing a 2-sentence review that any 6-year old can do to try to maliciously hurt a product/company that is in reality pretty good simply because someone offended their entitlements to being provided slave service and never-ending convenience was slighted by someone, wither or not the company had anything to do with it or not...\n\nWurm in itself is as sandbox as sandbox gets. There's no shortage of things a player could do from the moment they first log in. It is, however, a very niche genre too and requires a type of gamer with an acquired taste for this sort of thing to actually enjoy playing it. I would say the biggest downside to the Wurm experience is the notoriously clunky design of the game (UI, movement, the mechanics of the game in general, even the way it looks and feels). Some would say the graphics also suck too, and rightly so (can you say 1990s?) -- but that isn't really what makes a good game a "good game" either, so I wouldn't even count that against it personally.\n\nIf you are looking for a game that is fast paced and built more for the twitch gamer then do NOT buy this -- you are GARUNTEED to hate this if you do, you have been warned! On the other hand -- if you are the kind of gamer who likes to take their time and plan things out into what you are doing in the game, creative or otherwise, this may be a good game for you.\n\nA lot of people would herald Wurm as being the king of grinding games -- though this is may not be necessarily true for Unlimited as you can adjust the skill-curve as you want if you are the one hosting the server you play on, or you choose to play on a server that has a more forgiving skill-curve.\n\nI have played Wurm Online (Unlimited's predecessor) before and this is where all of my observations above stem from. I had gotten Unlimited for two reasons: 1) Because some old friends were playing it a lot and I thought I could give it a shot 2) The biggest reason -- so I could get some work in learning how to develop code in Java by making mods for Wurm.\n\nI regret it deeply.\n\nThis game really should be posted as early access at best. As a provider for a Server (or at least I tried) the process that you have to go through in order to get a server setup in the first place was a absolute nightmare. I literally had to dump the last two days straight almost into trying to get the server running the way I wanted (multiple maps, custom maps) with virtually no success. I had more luck teaching myself how to program and do complex networking (entirely by myself) with more success than trying to get the server package for Unlimited to work as intended. For those who know what that is like, then you'll know how much determination something like that requires -- for those who don't know what that means, you will have better chances at learning to speak a dead language, fluently, backwards, without busting a blood vessel midway.\n\nTo make things even more frustrating than they already were the forums (both here and on steam) for Unlimited were about as informative as Kim Kardashian would be answering physics questions on Quora. There was virtually nothing that could give me any meaningful information I really needed to be able to solve a lot of the problems I ran across trying to setup a multi-map server. CodeClub neglected to provide any kind of meaningful documentation or setup guides altogether, even on their wiki.\n\nSure, they can tell you how to hit the shiny green "GO" button for your server, but they kinda leave you high and dry whenever one of a long list of design flaws and bugs that comes with their server software hits you head on.\n\nSo -- here I am, writing a angry review wanting the last 48 hours of my life back along with my $29.99. I'm going back to writing my own code. Who knows, maybe I'll make a game sort of like Wurm, but one that doesn't make me feel like a 90's robot and has server software that actually WORKS, but won't make providers heads explode while trying to set it up in the process. Either that or I could go setup a Life is Feudal server instead...\n\nWait, did I just say Life is Feudal is less frustrating than Wurm? Wow, I didn't realize how bad this entire situation really was, this is SO much worse than I ever could have imagined -- that's a new level of low!\n\nSo yea... giving this a 2/5, only because the game in itself was not 100% garbage, but im taking the other 3/5 away because the tools provided are complete garbage, the company is awful at delivering a solid product that gives the user everything they need to make full use of it, forums are worthless, etc.\n\nIf you just wanna play to play, knock yourself out. Anything beyond that, get out while you can.\n\n***\n\nSpecial message to  CodeClub, provided they ever bother to read this: If your going to develop a game in a small, weak sector in the video game market (that has been declining for years as it is) you shouldn't start off with a full MMO title from scratch with little start up to base off. You should of made Unlimited first before trying to make a MMO. Quality of product aside, If LiF did anything right it was that, they knew those waves better than you guys did and they knew how to ride them and take advantage of them. So here we are, you guys were forced to push out Unlimited in response in effort to salvage what you can from Wurm while there's still time. Subscription models don't work as well as a lot of companies seem to think, especially with MMO's in this particular sector of the game industry. You should of done the one-time-fee model from the start, maybe addons or something for a little extra.\n\n***","November 11, 2015","false","3.9"," 26 of 53 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","26","53","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreamwarder/recommended/366220/","dreamwarder","dreamwarder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreamwarder/","265 products in account","I was suckered into buying this game by the large number of positive reviews. I really wanted to like it - I love sandbox games, and this seemed to tick every box for me, but it has some huge problems that most of the reviews I read either didn't mention or glossed over.\n\nFirstly, the UI is appalling. I found it unintuitive and unnecessarily labyrinthine. This is not a game you can load up and figure out how to play as you go along. You need to go to the wiki for even the most basic things, and the UI is so vastly different to most other games within the same genre you need to be prepared to learn a whole new way of controlling your charater and playing a game - a way dreamed up by a committee of insanely pedantic sadists - at least that's what it feels like.\n\nSecondly, progress is laughably slow on default settings. Your starting character is so incapable it might as well be a toddler, and being able to perform even basic actions reliably well seems to require hours of grinding.\n\nThirdly, while the game is clearly feature-rich this can also make it overwhelming for a new player, since the game makes no attempt at breaking you into the world slowly and carefully in an enjoyable way.\n\nDo not buy unless you are willing to do the following.\n\n1) Devote hours of time to reading the wiki.\n2) Print the wiki, or have it on another screen so you can make proper use of it.\n3) Spend hours on boring, repetitive tasks (dig some dirt, drop it, dig some more dirt, drop it, repeat for OVER AN HOUR to get digging skill to a useful level).\n4) Treat this game like a second job, and spend several hours on it every day, performing mostly boring, repetitive tasks, in order to one day, in several months time, be able to build a semi-decent house somewhere.\n\nIf that hasn't convinced you to pass on this, then consider my first half-hour of play.\n\nMinutes 1-10: Face sculpt my character, full of excitement for this new game I'm clearly going to spend hours and hours enjoying.\nMinutes 10-20: Explore the labyrinthine UI, trying to work out how the hell to do anything. Seriously, would a bit of context-sensitive left-clicking kill you people??\nMinutes 20-25: Give up trying to understand the UI. Venture outside the starting town. Find a sheep. Click "Look after" the sheep. Try and puzzle out what has changed. Click "look after" a small dog. Get told I can only "look after" one animal at a time. Punch the dog.\nMinutes 25-30: Trade blows with the dog. For five minutes. Neither of us loses more than one third of our health in that time. Log out and go and read the wiki.\n\nAfter an hour of exploring the wiki, I'm convinced this game is not for me.","January 6","false","0.5"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","48","11","23","5","5"

Like WoW you can play all you want but your skills won't go past 20 without paying a monthly fee.\n\nI have played wurm online so I am already familar with the GUI and systems.\n\nThe GUI if you have ever played eve online you will understand, its not for everyone, and you can tweak controls to bind to different keys making things a bit easier.\n\nYou will want people to play with no matter the style you play (most of you).\n\nA boar may kill you while you are building parts to make a wagon. Fact (tried to fight, did not go well).\n\n(Adventure)\nYou will die.\nYou will grind to make stuff.\nYou will will grind to get stuff.\n{As you level your skills it will be less of a grind}\n(Action speeds are adjustable in the server)\nThe time you put in will make things worth more to you then just getting it.\n\nI have played Wow, Eve, and both Wurm Versions. I like all of them and would suggest any of them.\nIs this game for everyone no. If you don't put in to make your builds yours then you wont get anything in return.\nI have had no trouble setting up my server and getting it running (if you would like to join {-TGD-}Gaming msg me)\nThere are some bugs most new releases have them, quite a lot had to be changed to make it work like this from Wurm Online.\n\nIf in doubt try Wurm Online. You will never know if its for you if you don't. Find some friends and create a world.\nOh and I haven't tried yet but being able to setup multiple severs linked in a cluster is badass if i can find enough people to justify trying it out.\n\nI hope this helps some people.

It's got a pretty steep learning curve. I'll go into that in a moment. Many players have started out with watching Youtube videos and reading walkthroughs before they start. Also the MAP (M) doesn't show your location. Those are the downsides.\n\nStarting out:\nYou'll type a character name in, most likely select a server and connect to it. Then you'll be prompted to customise your face and off you go, seemingly dropped in the deep end.\n\nOnce the initial pops are closed you'll see you main game window. Think Minecraft with way better graphics and no blocks!\nTurning around (WADS) is simple enough. If you press I you'll get your inventory up. C brings up your character screen if you're curious.\n\nTo the top left you have a stamina bar (how much energy you have). Doing heavy work or pulling heavy loads will make that drop. The lower it is the slower you'll work, so it's worth letting it fill regularly. Under that you have food and water. Drinking from any clean water source fills up your water bar quite quickly. Early on your best bet for food will be pumpkins. Other higher quality sources of food will bolster your nutrition value and provide learning advantages.\n\nOk.. now how to begin. Hit M. If you've joined a server anything like the last one I joined you'll have had a message telling you your starting grid on the map. That's it as far as map assistance is concerned. Stand still a while and you can read your compass in the top left, and get a good idea where you're headed. You'll have to pay attention to landmarks and figure out your own position from there. For reference the server I've just started on is "New Isles". There, you start in the grid to the SW of "Hearth" on the map. K11 I believe.\n\nSo, off you go exploring. If you happen to get attacked by any nasties for now, it's probbaly best to make a run for it. If you are near town and type "help" in the local chat window, guards from nearby towns will assist and deal with the threat.\n\nEventually you'll hopefully find a spot with some water source nearby for drinking, plenty of trees for wood, and a nice big slope for mining opportunities. Other useful resources include things like Sand, Clay, Peat, Tar, Moss etc.\n\nOpen your bag. To "READY" an item for use, you simply double click it, so double click your "Deed Stake" now. It should go green. Right click it to interact with it, and create your settlement. Start small as you can always resize it with your guards helping to clear threats as you go.\n\nNow you have a base of operations. If you've chosen to join someone elses town, you'll be in a similar position now on a plot. When you die now, you can respawn from your town centre.\n\nLets get some food first. Moving around and right clicking grass tiles will enable you to forage (explore the menus when you right click different things). Pumpkins will pop up once in a while. Right clicking one will give you the chance to eat it - watch your food bar recover. Do remember that the right click options will change depending on what item you have READY. If you have a Spade ready for example, you may be able to dig the earth too.\n\nItems all have weights. If you get overloaded, it may be worth dropping bits on the floor for now or your stamina bar will take a heavy hit and slow you down to boot.\n\nLets get started on a mine first, as iron plays a bit part. Face the steep slope nearby with your shovel equipped. You'll notice when moving your cursor over the floor tiles that you can see tile "borders" and centres as well as corners. As you become more experienced, mousing over borders will tell you the gradient of tiles. The shallower the slope, the easier it will be to pass / climb. If you stand on a corner and mouse over the borders going out from it you'll see where you could do with raising or lowering the land around you. Ideally slopes with a gradient of 15 or less make for easy passage. I tend to make mine with a 15 gradient when a path needs to go up or down.\n\nNow stand towards the middle of the slope, and start digging! As you dig you'll collect dirt in your inventory (press i). Right click the dirt to drop it AS A PILE when you have a few, and carry on digging, allowing your stamina to recover between bursts of digging. Dropping dirt ON THE GROUND instead of AS A PILE will actually level that corner of the tile UP that number of (inches?) This will take a few minutes to complete. Try to level it out on the other side of the tile as you go, digging further up the slope if needed so you're not left stuck in a hole you can't climb out of.\n\nEventually you'll hit rock. What you need to do now is clear off all the dirt from that tile ie each corner, until what's exposed it a rock face.\n\nNow READY your pickaxe. Right click the rock face and TUNNEL into it. You now have an open mine shaft. Move into it, and select the wall in front of you and MINE DOWN. This will create a slope going down. You should be at a good level now. Your best move at this stage is often to just use the "MINE" option rather than going down further - you don't want to hit the water table after all.\n\nAs you progress through the rock you can right click mine walls and prospect to look for traces of iron, following their clues. When you find iron, mine the iron wall and you'll get ore.\n\nThis is where it becomes more complicated. To extract the ore you'll need a furnace. Press the crafting button in the bottom right corner of your main window. In the bottom left of the crafting window is a little "list" button. Click it and type furnace in the search bar that pops up. If you click it, it'll list what you need to have in your inventory to start making one. The "starting" items show what two items from your inventory need to be dragged into the boxes at the top of the crafting panel. There may be other requirements for READY tools and other items in your bag for some items. Note you may need mortar for some stone works. To make mortar, look to your crafting list again - it will show that mortar required clay and sand. Bricks on the other hand require stone shards and a chisel. In each case you'll find yourself going back to the crafting window to see if the missing component is something you can make.\n\nSome advice - it's worth clicking on the other "chat" tabs at the bottom of the screen and speaking to other players if you're new. If there are any about when you ask they may help you to get off on the right foot / help you to spot areas of sand or clay etc. They are surface deposits and visible if you look around for them.\n\nWhen you have started making your furnace back at your mine, you can right click the partially assembled furnace and "add to crafting window". You'll then be able to drag one of the missing components at a time into the other box and continue building it up. In some cases you may require multiple tries until you're a more skilled craftsman.\n\nWhen it's finally finished, READY your hatchet and find a nearby tree. Select the tile it's on and "CHOP" the tree until it falls. Click the felled tree and "chop" it into logs until the tree is gone. Take open on the logs form the pile (open it and right click a log -> Take).\n\nNow open your crafting panel, put the log in one box and your carving knife in the other. Make some kindling. Go back to the furnace. READY your steel and flint, and light the furnace (uses a kindling). Now READY the log, right click the furnace and BURN the log. That should keep it going for a short time.\n\nOpen the furnace and drag any iron ore you have into it. After some time you'll be left with glowing hot iron ore, which you can work with.  Take it out the furnace and put it in your inventory. You can then craft with it while hot. TIP: earth needs to be flat and a mallet eqiupped to start planning a building on your deed.","January 1","true","154.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Personally I don't like microtransactions either and this  WU alievates that problem as well, since you buy WU as a standalone product its the equivelent of having a permanent premium status without the added cost of a monthly subscription. Basically WU lives up-to it's name unlimited. It literally puts the entire game into your hands..\n\nEdit (03/15/2016): For those unfirmiliar with WO - allow me to describe the gameplay; it basically is a minecraft-reminicent game that has elements such as crafting, building, combat (although this is not the best place for it's abilities to shine), gathering, production and use of tools. It has Monsters that you can fight against but the real beauty to me is in the creation system. You can assemble wall-by-wall a 3d decent quality house in the middle of nowhere. Due to unlimited versions capabilities you can make it where the normal WO work times are either much shorter (for easier play) or much longer (for the very tedious years of grinding to assemble one hatchet) depending on the server. Additionally the Unlimited version comes with everything you need to setup a server that is either offline (for LANs/Solo Play) or Semi-Dedicated. I call it semi-dedicated because there is no block on operating a client on the same machine as the "dedicated" seerver (unlike ARK and several other games I know of) My advice: Don't buy this for the graphics or the combat, buy it for the amount of replayability there is in a good day's effort on the land and for the friends who may or may not accompany you. This is without a doubt a sandbox-style game.","November 24, 2015","true","171.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, since it does have some enjoyable aspects and can be fun and since I love the concept of being able to build on your own, I will give it a "recommended IF."  If you like the option to work with others or alone; If you want a unique experience learning and building at your own pace; if you get tired of doing quests (because there are very few here); and if you like working with others then it's definitely worth a try.\n\nI do wish it had an easier way to set up your own world so you can play alone without having to encroach on others and without having to travel through woods infested with spiders, lions, trolls, bulls, etc. to get anywhere.  I wish it was easier to accomplish things on your own or maybe have the option to hire some NPC's to help with mining, building and sailing.\n\nThere are some Cons to be aware of though:  This is not an offline game.  It has a steep learning curve with little direction (there are some helpful YouTube videos though).  There are an Annoyingly high number of "things" that attack if you leave a town - makes it very difficult to "go off and be a hermit."  I want to play alone but haven't got a clue how to set it up because the interface window is decidedly unhelpful, lacking in direction or explanation and I have not found a YouTube video that explains it (except one where I did what they said and then my server? disappeared without a trace.)  I'm sure I did not do something correctly, but for those of us who grew up without the benefit of learning about computers by the time we entered grade school - you'll be lost if you try to set up your own.   I don't know why it has to be so confusing.\n\nI do like the game, though I would love to see some interesting NPC quests or something.  There is one guy at the beginning for the basics.  Also, some of them are standing in the floors, which interrupts your illusion of the game, because, well, there's a person standing in the floor... and that's the most interesting thing in the town.  The towns are boring because there is really nothing to do.  So you go out and build your place.\n\nOne other thing - can't you just sell the stinking nails!

I noticed that Wurm unlimited was much more stable than Wurm online.\n\nSo both version of the game is the same Except on wurm online you pay to play and on Wurm Unlimited you simply just pay one time and you can play forever til the world ends. or well til the internet dies.\n\nBut do I recommand this game? Yeah if you dont want to pay each month for a character and a towm (town isn't needed but it's for safety and having a chance to hide behind walls and have your own real life slaves who work for you if you command them to do stuff.)  If you think wurm online community is to harsh then this version WILL please you.\n\nI saw noobies talking about ropemaking and how amesome it was and that their the best... with a simple 15 in skill... Oh the time for each action was set to 7X speed and Skill gain was 3X gain. It took me half a hour to get my archery to 50 on that server.\n\nI still play wurm online to this very day and Pretty soon we are gonna get rifts, while WU wont get it at all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackd23/recommended/366220/","jackd23","jackd23","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackd23/","752 products in account","Do yourself a favour and turn off the music in the launcher options before starting the game.\n\nI'm not saying the tracks from Tom E. Morrison are bad work. But having played Wurm Online since 2008, I'll have to say that the music doesn't fit in-game AT ALL. In that regard it's simply bland and generic instrumental music. There is NOTHING that speaks "This is Wurm" in these. It seems like they randomly picked a bunch of tracks from a bag and gave them new, loosely Wurm themed names with no relations.\n\nHere's a most prominent example, the track "Beating the anvil". You would expect to get in some kind of craftsmanship mood, perhaps some kind of smithing. Weapon smithing, blacksmithing, shield smithing, armour smithing, jewelry smithing... okay, not jewelry smithing. In that regard, the track feels NOTHING like ANY sort of craftsmanship except that of the musician who made it, which is completely unrelated and unfitting.\n\nWhat a darn waste, man... waste of time and money. Compare it the old tracks by Joss Sanglier (21st Century Blues), aka Gurubear (e.g. "The Raven", "Little Miss Jane", "Johnny", "Wind's Last Master", "Blow Wind Blow", "Mol-Rehan Anthem", can be found via Google/YouTube).\n\nThose didn't fit in-game either in my opinion, but at least they had a lot of character, and personality. You could really identify the game within these, he'd sing about Wurm, he'd sing about things in Wurm, about players, places, stories that often really happened someplace in-game in the history of the game. They were strongly Wurm themed. I still listen to those songs to this day.\n\nYou're probably not missing out on much otherwise. I'd say you get a much more relaxed experience of Wurm playing Unlimited instead of Online. The difference is very significant in a small number of things. Economy is a big one. In Wurm Online, everything has a tangible value, because the in-game currency can be bought with real money from the developers or other players, and is closely tied to the real life EUR currency. But with perceived tangible monetary values comes longing, desires, possession, ownership, greed, too. You get a fairly sizeable player base, both hostile and friendly, and more drama than you can shake a stick at, for free. A mostly persistent cluster of PvE and PvP servers (wouldn't put all my money on the persistent bet for all servers though), and a decision making from the volunteer and paid staff, and ultimately the CEO, that is incomprehensible in a bigger picture at times, that leaves you disappointed and frustrated.\n\nHonestly, you can only win by playing Wurm Unlimited instead.\n\nYou can however, make a free account in Wurm Online, to get a taste of the game first. There's much you can do with all your skills limited to 20 skill points, but there's also "only so much" you can do with it.","January 10","true","360.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I was like what the hell is this... so much ♥♥♥♥ UI ... So ugly... I refunded it.. But then something from the game called me back. So again I ventured in the what I thought was a stale game, Only to relize what a gem this really is. I wondered for about a half an hour and found a fellow traveler working twoards the same goal as me... Which was to get across this river. We both walked  on the side of the cliff *BTW DON'T do THIS* Reason being walking on cliff consumes alot of stamina. Very close to death we made it to flat land. Only to come across a bear who killed my fellow traveler. I got his name but did not see him again... And in the end  I made it the other side because of his sacrifice. That moment instilled a sorta of feeling in me that I can't really describe.This moment combined with the music and the cheesy but loveable visuals is when this game began to work it's way into my heart. The crafting in this game is kinda crazy grindy but very rewarding. You can build anything from a full keep to a humble farm. ..

I *want* to play it.  I LOVE complicated games.  In fact, my favorite game of all time is my heavily modded Minecraft.  I thought for sure Wurm Unlimited would be perfect to get my hands dirty and have some complex fun, but wrestling with the server set up has been an annoying pain (I've run dozens of Minecraft servers without a hitch), and since you have to run a server even for single player....  well...  I'm glad I finally got it working, but frankly, the time I had to play it for today is done, and all I did was wrestle with getting the server set up.  Devs, this isn't fun.  :/  Now that I know how to get the server working every time for myself, (I'll worry about setting one up for friends AND myself another day), I'm gonna hold onto the game and hope, desperately, that the devs do a bit of work on some of these start up issues.  As it stands right now, I think the game needs a little bit more fixing up to be "new player" ready.   I can't comment about the actual game play itself as, after all this "play time" I STILL haven't actually played any of it, but after the time I've spent trying to get it going, I'm gonna call it a Not Recommended.

Not to say that is a bad thing, because this version may have lower graphical requirements (lower quality) then LiF does, it can also run on not only more computers but it also is much more expanded then Lif currently is.\nOnce you get the key bindings the way you like them it doesn't take long to figure out the crafting system. It is literally step by step to do everything, but at least it shows you which steps to take and tells you what you need in order to complete it. So even tho it looks at 1st like it is confusing, read carefully and pay attention and it is not hard at all.\nThe game also offers the option to host your own private server for yourself and/or friends only and every possible adjustment to the settings in game you could ever need. Multipliers on skills, grow periods, breeding times etc. The list goes on and on. I have not yet tried to play the game with friends but it is something we are considering trying at some point.","November 18, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","1"

It has a lot of the things I really enjoy like exploring, crafting, trading etc. However if you're the independent type like me and want to do it yourself with as little help as possible then this game probably isn't for you. So after 12 hours of play, I've had it.\n\nAs a newb, you start with a variety of things you need to make your way in the world, e.g. a carving knife, tent,  rope,shovel, pick axe, saw etc. The crafting system is fantastic. Everything works well until you try to take on your first animal/monster that has more strength than a rooster, a dog for instance.  Your death is all but guaranteed which results in everything you collected and made dropping on the ground and availble to anyone who decides they want it.  Ok not so bad, just don't pick on things above the level of a rooster like dogs, or sheep, or cows or seals etc.  Leave them alone and they leave you alone.\n\nUnfortunately many critters are aggressive, and appear virutally everywhere in the game, wolves for instance. As a newb even these lower level critters are impossible to defeat.  This has the effect of restricting your ability to build things because if you die in the wilderness you spawn someplace else and likely far away. And good luck trying to find your corpse to recover your stuff inasmuch as there is no way of identifying where you were other than guesstimating using the game map.\n\nWith a better combat system and more low level stuff to kill that would allow you to level you combat skills faster this game would be almost perfect. Unfortunately killing roosters, WHEN you can find them, gets old fast.\n","October 27, 2015","false","39.1"," 12 of 29 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","12","29","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/echohack/recommended/366220/","echohack","echohack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/echohack/","73 products in account","Before buying or playing this game, consider stabbing yourself in the eye first. At least you'll die quickly.\n\nIn a phrase: This game is a HORRIFIC version of Minecraft. Imagine if, in Minecraft, in order to chop down trees you had to increase a skill called Woodcutting. And increasing that skill would take you several HUNDRED hours of grinding, to get it to a reasonable level of tree-chopping-intensity. Now multiply that for everything in the game. Dirt? Digging. Stone? Mining. Planting crops? Farming. Fighting. Blacksmithing. Yo-yoing. Yes, you're going to spend more time grinding one skill in this game than it took you to finish Final Fantasy 7, unlock all the final limit breaks, get a gold chocobo, kill Emerald and Ruby weapon, and get the Knights Of The Round summon.\n\nThe graphics are horrible. Constant screen clipping, no third person mode, static animations, and characters that attempt to appear lifelike but are actually more static than the blocky characters in Minecraft. Little character customization means you can either spend 10,000 hours of your life to make your character look different (not exaggerating), or you can look like everyone else. So everyone looks the same.\n\nThe monsters are uninteresting and they all behave the same. Cat, Dog, Rat, Scorpion, Bear, Spider --- I just named half of the monsters available in the game. They are all the same thing - a static animal with minor animation and a hit box.\n\nThe sounds are terrible. Opening a treasure chest sounds like an overweight neckbeard full of cheese just farted inside your hoodie. You can actually fart on other characters -- which normally would be funny and awesome, but this game somehow takes what should be a universally funny thing and makes it actually bad. All of the characters can emote to each other and the emotes are FAR louder than any of the other sounds in the game, and are actually rather scary when you hear them for the first time.\n\nThe combat system is horrific. The game starts you out with a sword and shield, but you really won't even be able to kill a SINGLE rat without getting completely wrecked. If you do manage to die, then congradulations, you've just lost 20 or more hours of the skill grinding that you completed to get to where you are now. Yes: When you die, you actually LOSE SKILLS that you gain, AND all of the items you were carrying. The death penalty in this game is so harsh that I'd rather die in Hardcore mode in Diablo 3 and lose my character forever than die in this game -- making a new character in Diablo 3 would actually take less time to gear up than trying to regain the skill loss in Wurm.\n\nThe main attraction of this game is that you can claim land "a deed" and make it your own, build a house on it, etc. Unfortunately, you have to pay upkeep on this deed, and all the stuff you build on this deed will decay over time. You stored your weapons in a container so you could use them later, and it's been a few weeks? SORRY, they are probably decayed too much now and they are GONE. If you're lucky they are only damaged, and you'll have to spend a few HOURS repairing them and improving them back to their former glory.\n\nThe worst part is that other players can "deed up" land next to yours and set you to a "kill on sight" list on their deed. Even on PvE servers, there are so many ways that other players can grief you it's not even funny. Oftentimes, the server admin will allow this because it is "legal play". If you've bothered to improve land off your deed, then other players can come by and stake your hard-worked land, ruin it, or do whatever they want to it.\n\nIf you or your friends even think you like this game, STOP NOW and go play Minecraft. Or inject yourself with heroin in the eyeball, because that will actually be a better experience.\n\nThis game belongs on a list with Daikatana, Superman 64, Shaq Fu, and crystal meth.","January 3","false","123.3"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","33","5","15","5","0"

Honestly, I don't even have that bad of a system to run it.\nMOST IMPORTANTLY, this game takes a lot of time to get use to. Everything about it seems rather slow. Combat is slow, progress is slow, traveling is extremely slow, and a lot of death. There just so many that make you realize how slow this game is, and you will notice is right from the get go. I think this game uses this concept of being slow to make it seems like it's a really impersive game. However, I don't think that's what makes it imersive, I think it's the content. I didn't play enough to really experience all the contect. I tried creating my own server to try and accelorate everything, but it still took for ever.

I believe that it would have been a really great game. Sadly I have had to refund it. I created a character on a few different public servers and their bodies were always stretched out and their heads moved a foot infront of their necks. This pretty much made it unplayable due to not being able to see much of anything.\n\nOn top of that I was unable to create a LAN server that I could see on the server list. I followed all of the guides and it simply didn't work out for me.\n\nIf the streaching man problem would have not occured, I may have been able to deal with not being able to have my own server, but that pushed it over the top.\n\nIf there was a simpler way to have a single player experience, and if the streatching man issues was resolved, I would definantly give this game another shot. Until then, I will not be able to recommend this.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nedit: Since posting this review I have figured out how to fix the Stretching man issue. I have also been able to play Wurm Online. From what I understand it is exactly like Wurm Unlimited in terms of gameplay. I really love the gameplay in this. And if I was only looking at the gameplay with this review, then I would be recommending it to everyone. However, singleplayer is a key aspect in Wurm Unlimited, and I was never able to get it to work despite following all of the guides. Because of this I am going to have to downvote it for now.\n\nI hope this helps!","October 24, 2015","false","0.6"," 19 of 45 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","19","45","0","3"

I did not play it PvP or with others and I think if there's any real fun to be had with this game it would be with that.\n\nThe primary problem I had with this game is a lack of NPCs. It has as amazing crafting system, but to build a lot of things you have to be a jack of all trades mining, smithing, sewing, cooking, and so forth. For example, you can be a great wood worker, but that doesn't help you make metal arrow heads which are required to make arrows. There probably should have been some more primitive options like flint arrow heads or something.\n\nAnyway, you would think you would go to a town and trade for the items you are not prepared to make yourself. But when I finally found my way to Hearth (a city in the game), There was only one NPC that would talk to me who was obviously there to guide new players on what to do (although by the time I found him I had been playing for an entire day already and knew how to do pretty much everything he taught). He eventually directed me to an NPC that did nothing but stand there who was, I suspect, probably the guy you are supposed to trade with. Basically, there was nothing in the city to interact with which largely made the city pointless.\n\nAnd that really gets to the point of "Why are you crafting all this stuff?" I suppose there's something sort of "Mine Craft" about this game. But we've had an over abundance of "You're alone in the world - go build some stuff" games.\n\nThis is really the MMORPG handed over to you. You have to setup your own server to play alone.\n\nBut this also means that if you had a group of friends, you could maybe all play on your server and each could take on different roles as you work together to build a city and such. That might make up for the lack of NPCs.\n\nSome people seem to like it for PvP, although I personally don't think a crafting game is ideal for PvP. I personally don't think you should have skills and levels for PvP as everyone should basically be on the same level and it should more rely on the player than how much grinding they've done. A level 20 is always going to beat a level 3, so what's the point? Get everyone on the same level and then it becomes about the players rather than their characters. But some people are enjoying it for PvP; so more power to them.\n\nOverall, I felt it was mostly a waste of money. There was a lot to like about the crafting system and survival system, but overall I just didn't feel like it delivered.","October 30, 2015","false","23.2"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","6","21","0","0"

Its my honest reccomendation if your considering this game, to do some research. Definately watch some videos of gameplay other than the ones listed on Steam.\n\nThere's a real steep learning curve for this game that's pretty frustrating if your not playing on a server, or the MMO. You don't have the opportunity to ask 'Noob' questions via chat like more experienced players have been able to before.\n\nThere's also not a wiki support for the game like will find with other sandbox games (like Minecraft) that detail how to craft items, or what the prerequisite to obtaining the are. As others have commented below, it is possible to find the information you need to get started; but you'd better be ready to spend a heafty amount of time watching Youtube Videos, and browsing forums before you'll be able to actually play the game.\n\nFor example: the developers do a poor job of setting expectations for how long it will take to build your empire. In the video, building  speed is obviously sped up - but  if your expecting to get even a wall built within your first 5 hours of gameplay you're in for a surprise. To build a wall requires wood, and nails. Wood is pretty easy to obtain. Chop down a tree, cord it up, and then saw up some boards. However, to get the nails is an entirely different story...\n\nTo tunnlel out a mine takes 'actions' and the default action for mining is roughly 9~ seconds. It takes between 30 to 50 'actions' to move one block in. That's Roughtly 4 ~7 minutes to mine ONE 'block' in. Now imagine you have to find the iron 5 blocks deep that it takes to make the nails, to build your first wall.\n\nI'm not saying this game doesn't have the potential to be fun, but if you're looking for a sandbox you can pick up and run with in an afternoon, I'd suggest watching some Lets Play videos first to get your feet wet.","November 8, 2015","false","3.6"," 2 of 18 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","2","18","0","2"

From the outside it says it near by but once you are in you mine suddenly it's not near by anymore. you Dig up and down and all around and 2 hours later after several tunnels - still no iron one. So you start a new server to start over hoping for rock lower down... 3 hours into it, no iron.\nYou're are overloaded too quickly and then the snail pace turns into not moving at all. So you start dropping things everywhere all the time.\nGood luck leveling the dirt too. You can only hold so much in your inventory so moving it around it a massive time sink but it doesn't matter. After 14 hours of mining and chopping and basically understanding what the life of a snail is like because you pretty much accomplish nothing...\nOh and then there is the combat... again it's like a couple of snails going at it.

The gaming world has evolved past this sort of idea to a much more friendly hotkey/drag-and-drop system.\n\n-Just trying to chop a tree down involves having to open the inventory (which is list based), double click the axe, then open your character sheet, then drag the currently equipped sword into your inventory, then drag the axe into your right hand, then right click on the tree, then slect a series of options on the popup menu, then repeat until the tree falls down.\n\nIt's just bulky and combersome, and for no reason.\n\n-The actual play is slow, and painful. I mean, moving around the world is slow, the reaction to items you have to interface with is slow, and the general gameplay is slow.\n\nI will NOT be recommending this game to any of my friends.\n\nI just wish I could get my money back.","May 19","false","1.7"," 9 of 39 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","9","39","0","11"

Problems I have found are Server Creators are leaving the Enemy Spawn (Agressive Creatures) at 30% it should be reduced to at least 10% especially since there are 4000 creature spawns in limited unprotected zones, it doesn't take long for them to kill off nearly every docile creature (chicken, horses, cows) also random player spawns means instant death to anyone joining your server... I joined, died and chose to respawn at a safe zone ok. I traverse mnts, die repeatedly to every Dragon, Hell Hound and Troll that have multiplied every day your server has been up. Enemies are thick as theives but you fight them one by one only dieing 5-7 times per battle to have them respawn & learn that No "Deed Stake" for claims work if there is any enemy in the area your attempting to zone. With no real battle equipment to start there is no way to clear every enemy (sqeezed into one of the few unclaimed / unprotected zones) = Quit game. The only server good for you to freely roam & begin your own settlement needs docile creatures 20 chickens to 2 trolls ( real time = 0 chickens 6 trolls ) The aggressive creatures breed, get stronger & fatten up on the animals you need to survive. Deed & Settlement costs from the beginning are impossible without others to trade with to earn silver = dead end. The best server I played was the one I created... Agressive creatures 10% with no deed cost for start up & trader or merchants along with your bartender & gaurds.","December 11, 2015","true","111.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The download and install can be a tricky and hard to figure out. Once that is done, the game itself is very arcane and complicated. It is not as intuitive as I would have wanted it to be. You will def. need to alt+tab to google "wurm unlimited" for all of your answers. Do not bother with the in-help game pedia as it is woefully lacking and pointless. There are some glaring glitches and there are MANY CTDs. This is the most unfortunate aspect of the game: it will simply just lock up and it takes FOREVER to close. By forever I mean go pack your lunch for work, shave, and shower and it MIGHT be close to closing and going to desktop. I ended up just doing a hard restart which was 100% quicker, but I know is hard on the system. I have scoured the internet for answers to the ctds but there is really no help beyond the idiotic "check your drivers" "restart your computer" etc. etc. You know, the things that NEVER help but every incompetent fool tells you because they don't know what else to say...\n\nThe game is worth buying and playing though despite all the horse manure that comes close to ruining the experience. There are subtle "ah ha" moments that really endear the game. I cannot stress enough to go online for all your questions because you can easily get too frustrated and just quit. The "wurmpedia" is a terrific resource and without it the game would be pointlessly too hard. Last, I HIGHLY recommend setting up your own server and getting to know the game first before going head to head with other players. Also, when you are setting up your own game: don't be afraid to give yourself a very high starting value for all of your attributes and skills. The game is hard enough and you will not feel like you are cheating whatsoever. I didn't do this and it took a very long time to become even average in my skill levels. Even then I still have animals kill me that should never be able to. Also, raise the quality of your weapons as soon as possible (this is called "improve"). You may think just because you have mined, smelted, and forged your longsword after a week straight of hour upon hour grinding that you can now go take on that wolf or bear only to be killed even faster than when using your starting shortsword! It is because you still need to raise the quality of the weapon... I just saved you a LOT of frustration and hours of research. :-) This game is serious and not for quick thrill gamers. It is for the patient, plotting (not plodding), intelligent gamer who doesn't mind making mistakes and learning from them. If you can overlook some glaring flaws, there is a real gem hiding underneath (but you have to raise your mining skill high enough to get to it) ha ha...","January 28","true","139.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Absolutely nothing is straight forward and extremely time consuming.  Even digging a damn hole, try to dig straight into the side of a hill and you will only dig straight down and then uh oh, you can't dig on that type of terrain.  It's difficult to level an area to start building.  I tried to use the in game guide but most descriptions are remarkably long and vague.  I tried to watch Youtube videos but they too are incredibly long and hard to understand because key points are mixed in with 10 to 15 minutes of rambling.  Man, I already gave my best years to Uncle Sam, I don't need to spend the last half of my life figuring out the basic machanics of a video game.  I would only recommend this game to someone with absolutely no life and patience that is insurmountable.\n\n*Update*\n\nDue to my stubborness and the money I spent on this game, I have persisted in trying to open this game up to see if it got better with a little more understanding.  I have found it is in fact a very deep and amazing game along the lines of Minecraft (I say that loosely due to the fact that it is much more in depth than Minecraft).  As you can see, I have sunk 90+ hours into this game, 70 of which was with my wife who also bought the game to give it a try.  About 15 of those hours was dedicated to leveling a 12x13 patch of land between a bay and a small lake to build a castle and courtyard.  While I know it is a big job to build such an abode, we find that it is entirely too time consuming.  90% of the time you are waiting for action bars ~2-5 seconds each, but we are talking thousands of times.  To level the land we have scalped and gutted a hill behind where the castle sits for the dirt and stone with the intentions of leveling the hill itself when finished.  This hill is almost completely gutted now, and I have found absolutely no information either on forums, wurmpedia or youtube on how to actually demolish the carcass of it.  It wont let us mine the outer walls, so now we are left with the eyesore blocking our view to the bay.  With all that work and all those hours and all that material, we have only finished the shell of the first floor and half of the second.\nNow, having said all that, this is my point.  I play video games a lot.  I almost eat, sleep and breath them.  It blows me away that it is such a large game that has been around for about ten years and it still has actions, items and other good to know things that either has no description or explanation that is plainly worded and easy to understand.  Or if there is it is so hard to find.  It took me several attempts to find an explanation on how to expose a rock face to make a tunnel I don't have to climb to (you have to dig all four corners of a tile until you hit rock).  Why was something so simple yet so necessary wrapped up in a 20 minute video on youtube instead of being the first thing stated on the ingame wiki?  Why is there no back button on the crafting guide menu?   I stand by my initial review.  This game is definitely for people who love Minecraft but want better asthetical creations and not only have the time to devote to the creation but also the patience.  Either that or many, many friends that will play as well to help with the man hours needed to complete projects.On the server list you'll see tons of servers, but most are empty and locked or they have 1 to 2 players on it.  That is the player base and it is remarkably small.\n\nUpdate, Mar 2, 2016:\n\nI admit, my initial opinion of this game was a little harsh.  190hrs+ in the game and I still have much I don't know in regards to certain aspects of the game, such as religion, magic, etc.  That being said  I have changed my mind about the monotony of the game, but it comes at a serious learning curve.  Navigation in the world sucks in my opinion.  It's easy as hell to get lost if you dare to explore, especially in dense forests.  It does have a remarkably indescript map and it leaves you wondering which hill you are standing on or which channel of the sea you are looking at since you don't have a character marker on the map.  As of the latest patch farms are now useless because crops timers aren't working so they will only grow with GM powers.  Here's hoping they hotfix it soon.    Aside from navigation and the complexity (including server management) the game is pretty good.  Incredibly in depth, and like I said before, minecraft for adults.","October 29, 2015","true","286.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would also recommend playing with at least one friend to make things faster.\n\nSo buy this game if you feel you have enough free time, are a minecraft survival fan and like beeing able to do whatever you want in a game (as opposed to playing stupid linear games), it's definitely worth buying it !","October 21, 2015","true","57.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Problems I have found are Server Creators are leaving the Enemy Spawn (Agressive Creatures) at 30% it should be reduced to at least 10% especially since there are 4000 creature spawns in limited unprotected zones, it doesn't take long for them to kill off nearly every docile creature (chicken, horses, cows) also random player spawns means instant death to anyone joining your server... I joined, died and chose to respawn at a safe zone ok. I traverse mnts, die repeatedly to every Dragon, Hell Hound and Troll that have multiplied every day your server has been up. Enemies are thick as theives but you fight them one by one only dieing 5-7 times per battle to have them respawn & learn that No "Deed Stake" for claims work if there is any enemy in the area your attempting to zone. With no real battle equipment to start there is no way to clear every enemy (sqeezed into one of the few unclaimed / unprotected zones) = Quit game. The only server good for you to freely roam & begin your own settlement needs docile creatures 20 chickens to 2 trolls ( real time = 0 chickens 6 trolls ) The aggressive creatures breed, get stronger & fatten up on the animals you need to survive. Deed & Settlement costs from the beginning are impossible without others to trade with to earn silver = dead end. The best server I played was the one I created... Agressive creatures 10% with no deed cost for start up & trader or merchants along with your bartender & gaurds.","December 11, 2015","true","111.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The crafting is emaculate.  This is the college graduate program of mine-crafty types and the highmark standard for authentic play.  The feeling of building a small settlement with friends, getting bigger,  bringing in more workers, having a spy, getting invaded and having our new castle razed to the bottom of the mine was life changing.  Do you want to know the true struggle of a medievil mason?  How about the real honor and valour it takes to me a knight?  This is like living in a documentary.  Be prepared for the slow grind, but also be thrilled that you can now changed EVERYTHING about the game in Unlimited.  Wurm is truly worth your time.","April 20","true","30.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a single player type of gamer. This is the first time I've got involved with an online game world and am really enjoying it.\n\nIt will take some time to learn the ins and outs. There are many youtube videos that can help you get started. There's also an in-game help guide while crafting that is invaluable. And I've found that people in the servers are more than happy to help answer questions. Everyone I've met on the  servers have been very friendly and helpful.\n\nOnce you figure out how to create in the world, the skies the limit.

No idea what i was getting into.. For the price i did get other games where you craft and survive for cheaper ( 7 days to die, rust empyrion galactic...).  I bought it and decided to give it a fair shot!  Honnestly it is a great game!  Ok i admit coming in going wait a minute this aint wow no question mark telling me where the quest giver is.  Old school kicking in.  I can forage. I can build a fire but i need to chop wood make kiddling use flint and steel. etc..etc.. Omg this is so realistic and fun.  I actuly need to find food and water to survive not just use to buff.  I tried all mmorpg out there. I tried all kinds of survival sandbox game.. I love crafting, exploring questing.
