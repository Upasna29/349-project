We have a pair of TVs set up in the lounge for mine to play on at these parties, and the rest tend to play Cards Against Humanity or socialise elsewhere in the house.\n\nI was immediately impressed by how quickly both groups sat down in the lounge to give the Jackbox a go when I first bought it yesterday. We started with a round of Fibbage 2, which was loud, funny and silly enough for everyone to feel comfortable giving it a go without having to feel like they were joining the 'gamer' half of the crowd. Since you're controlling the games from your phone, nobody has to feel like they're out of their comfort zone with an Xbox controller or constantly waiting for a turn with a gamepad. Both the gamers and non-gamers in the group were able to play together, which is a really hard trick to pull off.\n\nThe games in the pack are varied enough to keep things interesting, and none of them are disappointing. I will say, though, that while the bomb disposal game is still pretty hilarious and engaging, it is a LOT harder than the others - the story mode is purely cooperative, and it can be a lot harder for less engaged players to feel like they're contributing. It also supports fewer players, which ended up cutting our playtime short in favour of the other titles.\n\nI tried really hard to find a deal on this game before I picked it up, but I'm pretty happy with the $25 I paid for it in the end. We're going to be cracking it out again in the future, and it's a safe and reliable option for crowds who aren't necessarily full of gamer types.","October 24, 2015","true","12.7"," 81 of 86 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","81","86","7","1"

In fact, it's better, as it's missing a really obvious "total dud" of a game like the first one had in the form of Word Spud. While the first pack was really only being carried by two of its games, every game in here is entertaining, and while some fare better than others, there's something to love for anyone here.\n\nIf you want an fantastic local multiplayer game, get this. It doesn't matter if your friends do not play that many games - it's an incredible, but accessible experience either way, and the more players you can get, the better.","October 13, 2015","true","13.5"," 69 of 72 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","69","72","7","3"

More Fibbage is always great; Bidiots if an interesting drawing game which is oddly strategic; Earwax is a fun take on using sound effects instead of writing; Quiplash is a lot of fun and the extra questions are appreciated compared to the original; and Bomb Corp is really different (cooperative! what is this!?) but very funny and challenging. Not necessarily any better than the first pack, but it's great to have an even bigger diversity of games to play so I would recommend this just as much as I recommend the first pack.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kt_extinction/recommended/397460/","kt_extinction","KT_Extinction","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kt_extinction/","1026 products in account","Do you have a lot of friends that come over to your house? This is a perfect party game. Instead of an emphasis on gameplay skill or quick reflexes, these games are much more focused on wits, intelligence, and humor. It's perfect even for people who don't usually play video games. We all know that one time when we went over to a friend's house to play Mario Kart/ Super Smash Bros or something and he crushed all of us without even trying because he's the only one who owns the godamn game damnit. There's no such advantages available here, since the game is mainly trivia/ humor based.\n\nAnother great thing is you don't have to go fiddling around with any Xbox game controllers or anything like that. There is a cool browser based system where you just have to enter a code at jackbox.tv, using any browser. This means anyone with a smartphone can easily connect to the game they want to play as long as they have an internet connection. This is genius stuff, some of the games can have up to 8 players so instead of having to fiddle with a bunch of tangled wires/ teach everyone the controls, it is simple enough to set up and play. I've had good success using Valve's Steam Link paired with this game on a large TV with a group of people, it's always a good time!\n\nThe party pack comes with these 5 games below, although you'll probably only regularly play 2 or 3 of them.\n\nFibbage:\nThis game is played a lot I think, essentially some trivial question is given that nobody will likely know, it's pretty obscure stuff like "What did Abraham Lincoln get as a present from this random governor on Independence Day?" or something similar, players have to input a good lie they think may fool everyone else, and then everyone chooses from a compiled list of lies from players and one truth embedded within. You get points for both fooling others and picking out the truth. Always a goofy fun time!\n\nEarwax:\nEssentially Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity in audio form, everyone gets a prompt, and is given a list of random sounds to choose from. This can be pretty fun, like a prompt would say "Superman, while drunk." and you can respond with the sounds *Loud, Long Fart* followed with *Man Screaming*. However, the issue with this game is you don't get to hear the sound before you play it so sometimes the results are not what you expect.\n\nBidiots:\nThis one is complicated. Everyone is given a different subject to try and draw on their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little smartphones, and there's a set price to each art piece, which is kept hidden from players. Everyone gets only a few hints as to how much each piece is worth, and they take turns bidding on each art piece at an auction. Whoever makes the most profit wins. This can be pretty fun but there's quite a bit of strategy involved. It'll probably take a couple of times before people understand completely how this game works, but it's one of the deeper experiences in here, there's a lot of strategies like "fake bidding" to raise the price of a piece you know isn't worth anything. Pretty fun but you need a group that's willing to learn a bit about the mechanics to get the most out of it.\n\nQuiplash:\nPretty popular game, a prompt is given and people write what they think would be the funniest response to it. After this, people vote on what they think is the funniest/ most apt response. It's mostly humor based, from what I can tell. I actually found this game kinda boring, there wasn't enough structure to keep my interest for too long, but you might like it.\n\nBombCorp:\nKind of a simpler Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, this game has you defusing bombs with a group of friends. You essentially shout out instructions on how to defuse a bomb and somebody tries to defuse it without it going off. This game only has 4 players maximum and is probably better suited for a smaller group of dedicated people. There is a psuedo-story mode and looks pretty fun, but I haven't played it much.\n\nJackbox Party Pack 2 is a fun selections of party games that will always be a hit with friends, unless your friends are big lame-os who hate fun.","May 12","true","26.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Unfortunately, the second pack is mostly disappointing.\nMy most immediate gripe is that it is such a shame to see this as a separate game, as opposed to DLC for the first party pack. Switching between the two during an evening is an annoying waste of time and shows that the developers aren't particularly interested in creating a long-lasting product. After purchasing it was also disheartening to see that the main menu was less stylised than the moving game boxes from the first game. A small problem, yes, but it just comes across as a lack of effort.\n\nMoving onto the games themselves and it is clear that you and your friends will spend much less time with this selection of games than the last. Bidiots is too confusing and not gratifying enough to be a good party game. Bomb Corp also doesn't work well in this setting either, although when playing with just you and one friend it does have a small amount of fun to it. Talking of fun however, the rest of the games are more enjoyable. Unfortunately one of them is just more Fibbage. This does mean a wider selection of questions for those who love the game, but it is again sad to not see this as DLC for the first pack or integrated with Steam Workshop. The last of the games (Earwax and Quiplash) are the most enjoyable and fresh. However, they can both get repetitive more quickly. Earwax is fun to play to laugh at the silly sounds, but is rather lacking in real gameplay and Quiplash is perhaps too difficult to keep everyone laughing.\n\nAfter mostly having an absolute blast with Jackbox Party Pack 1, it would have been nice to have seen more work gone into new games. However, overall the sequel just doesn't put as much effort in as its older brother and still lacks DLC and Steam Workshop support. Such a disappointment.\n\nRead My Other Reviews\nCheck Out My Curator Page","November 12, 2015","false","13.9"," 28 of 57 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","28","57","0","0"

The first one has Fibbage and Drawful, this one has Fibbage 2, Quiplash, and Earwax. I didn't even get to trying Fibbage 2 yet and I would heartily recommend this pack for Quiplash and Earwax alone. Quiplash is basically a Cards Against Humanity with slightly fewer horrendously inappropriate prompts, where everyone votes and instead of playing an answer card you fill in your own blanks. Bomb Corp is passable and Bidiots is, while interesting, a not-quite-Drawful that gets extremely long in the tooth. If you have any remotely artistically inclined people, Drawful is still an excellent reason to get the first pack, but for my money, while it can be hit or miss on a round-to-round basis, Earwax is by far the hardest I've laughed at something in the last decade. It feels like I have a social life again, and I'm just using Skype screensharing. (Just make sure whoever's hosting has a decent upload rate, and I'd recommend at least 4 people for the best experience.)\n\nUltimately I think it boils down to whether you want to try to draw wolf parades, Cthulhu, and abstract concepts like "burger time", or if you'd rather hear "what most men think goes on inside a uterus" depicted with sound clips of firecrackers, lasers, clowns, pig squeals, sawblades, and ghosts. Either way it's hard to go wrong.\n\nAnd there's still Drawful 2 and Jackbox 3 to look forward to. God bless you, Jellyvision, your PC port of the new YDKJ may have been ♥♥♥♥ but you're still masters of your craft where it counts.","March 27","true","2.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998825270/recommended/397460/","76561197998825270","The Dorf","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998825270/","273 products in account","As I did when I reviewed the original Jackbox Party Pack, I'm going to divide this review into several little mini-sections: one for each game in the pack. The Jackbox Party Pack 2 is at its core, the same concept as its predecessor - a bunch of multiplayer mini-games where your cell phones are the input devices. The novelty here is that because your phones are the input devices, no one knows who typed or drew what except for the author. So now on with the review:\n\nFibbage 2\nThis is exactly the same game as the first time around, but with new questions. The game presents you with a weird fact, and you have to fill in the blank to try to trick your opponents into guessing your answer. Still pretty much Balderdash if you've ever played that.\n\nEarwax\nIn earwax, you're presented with a category or an event or some similar thing and you have to choose a sound effect to match what's presented.  Then two player's selections go head to head and a judge votes on which is the most appropriate sound effect. I thought this game was pretty weak and the selectable sound effects started to repeat with just two or three rounds of play. Disappointing.\n\nBidiots\nThis was the strangest game in the pack. It seemed like an attempt to evolve on Drawful, which I believe to be the strongest game in the previous pack. In Bidiots, each player draws several art pieces based on several prompts. The pieces are assigned random monetary values, then players bid on each piece. Sometimes you'll be given clues to what a piece is worth based on the prompt that was used to draw it, but it's not always clear what prompt matches with what piece. And sometimes, you're not given a prompt at all. It turns one of the best games in the previous pack into one of the most unsatisfying experiences in Jackbox Party Pack 2. The rules are unclear and the games take way too long. The fun and silliness of drawing and guessing other's drawings turns into a boring bidding game. Bidiots was also a huge disappointment.\n\nQuiplash XL\nThis is pretty much Earwax but without the sound effects. Players type in responses to the game's prompts to fill in the blank, then a judge votes on the best one. Quiplash still seemed somewhat lazy to me but was slightly more enjoyable than Earwax, only because a freeform response seemed more creatively satisfying to me than picking from pre-defined sound effects.\n\nBomb Corp.\nI'm not sure who worked on this game whether it be a different group internally or a secret different studio altogether or something, but this game is so different from the others in the pack, both in visual aesthetic and gameplay quality. This is definitely the highlight of Jackbox Party Pack 2. In Bomb Corp. , each player is given a crucial step to disarming a bomb on their phone, but all steps need to be followed in order to diffuse the bomb correctly. It's a really fun excersise in communication and cooperation as all players need to work together to diffuse the bomb properly. This game was pretty cool\n\nSummary\nEven with the inclusion of the excellent Bomb Corp., The Jackbox Party Pack 2 was still a disappointment to me. Other than Bomb Corp., the pack felt like a rushed package with incomplete or creatively dull ideas resulting in unsatisfying gameplay experiences. The absense of the well-known "You Don't Know Jack" mini-game was puzzling as well. I'm not sure if they tried to rush this package out in order to capitalize on the success of the first game or what, but that's what it felt like. If you haven't played the games from the first Jackbox Party Pack, I'd strongly reccommend giving those a look first. But if you have, prepare yourself for a disappointment\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","March 8","false","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Like the last pack, you get 5 games in one package.\n\nFibbage 2 which is the same as the original Fibbage only with new questions and a handy little "DeFIBrilator" ability that eliminates all but two answers (one lie and the truth) but at the cost of halving the point values.\n\nEarwax is a fun little game where one player selects a prompt from a pregenerated list of prompts while the other players select two choices from a list of predetermined sound effects that best fit the prompt (in their opinion). The players don't get to hear the sound cues until they's played on the screen so the players have to select the sounds by their written description. Earwax is played until one player reaches 3 points which makes for disappointingly short games some times.\n\nBidiots is probably the most difficult of the games available. There are a number of complicated rules and you can never really determine who's winning until the very end. It is fun to hear the different jingles for "Preditory Loans."\n\nQuiplash XL is the same as the standalone Quiplash game (also highly recommended) only with more questions.\n\nFinally Bomb Corp is an interesting 8-bit variant of "Keep-Talking-and-nobody-explodes."

This trivia game for liars features some outrageously funny new facts — much more than the first Fibbage — and now your audience, whether it's your Twitch/Hitbox viewers or leftover partygoers, can join in on the fun too. The novelty might wear off once you start getting repeats, but that won't happen for a long while. 9/10\nEarwax: "Cards Against Humanity but with sound effects" is a cool concept, but ultimately it falls short. It's not that the sounds are bad, and the prompts are pretty good too. The problem is the execution. You're given six random sounds and you have to pick two to fit the prompt — without being able to listen to them. Sometimes you don't get anything that fits. Sometimes this happens for the entire game, and you feel like you had no chance from the start. Jackbox doesn't lend itself well to games of chance. Another point against it that it doesn't stream well on Twitch (Hitbox, given its lower stream delay, is fine), and if you're trying to play it with friends on Skype, forget it. 3.5/10\nBidiots: Most people are calling this a worse Drawful. I respectfully disagree. "Art auction" seems like a bizarre concept for a party game, but Jackbox managed to pull it off. Each player gets two short descriptions that are eerily simular to everyone else's prompts. For instance, one player might get "eel" and "getting a tan", while another gets "garter snake" and "needs sunscreen". The challenge is figuring out which is which. It's honestly a lot more fun than it sounds, and I'm sorry that I can't describe it any better. 8.5/10\nQuiplash XL: Quiplash is the best game that Jackbox has ever released. Yes, even better than any of the You Don't Know Jack games. Even with repeat prompts, you'll practically never run out of things to say. It's a freeform Cards Against Humanity, and it succeeds in places where CAH doesn't — namely, you get to make your own jokes, which is perfect both for people who don't like vulgar humor and for those who want to kick it up a notch. 10/10\nBomb Corp: Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, but not as good. Sure, there are extra twists to it, but it just feels too similar (and inferior) to its direct competitor. Fun for a bit, but ultimately a dud. 4.5/10\n\nOVERALL: 7.5/10 (average score: 7.1/10).

No matter who I'm hanging out with, whether online or all sitting in a room together, everyone has a great time with Jackbox games, this one included. I recommend picking it up on sale if you're unsure. Can't wait to see more from this company, their consistent awesomeness has made all of their games a day-one purchase for me.\n\nMy only complaint is that Earwax and Bidiots are nearly impossible to play with stream viewers. There's usually a ~15 second delay and both of these games require a near-immediate response to be fully caught up with everything going on.\n\nYou can watch some highlights from one of my playthroughs here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHd7106edEY","May 25","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/garetare/recommended/397460/","garetare","garetare","http://steamcommunity.com/id/garetare/","391 products in account","A great assortment of games for a okay price. Each game brings fun to the table. From picking surprisingly fitting sounds to match a given prompt to defusing bombs, this pack provides fun for any party night.\n\nSmall word of warning though. If you plan to play this with only a certain group of friends or two, I would not recommend playing Quiplash for a majority of the time. I know people say it's the funnest in the pack, but there is one key flaw, not with the game though. Friends may tend to repeat jokes. At first it may seem a bit funny but after spending a lot of time in it you may start to grow tired of what is a fantastic game in the pack. I would recommend not having this (or possibly Fibbage 2, it can apply there as well) to be your most played games in the pack.\n\nTo me the games that let this pack shine the most are Bomb Corp and Biddiots.\nBomb Corp is a co-op game where each player gets a set of instructions (or some other form of handicap that requires the group to work together) that must be followed to diffuse bombs. If one person messes up ...  BOOOOM! Back to the start of that day. It can be frustrating but fun at the same time, plus beating that one day you were stuck on is very rewarding.\n\nBiddiots is a game where each player must draw 2 pieces of art and then bid on everyone else's art. The goal is to make the most money by buying expensive pieces for cheap. The screw mechanic from You Don't Know Jack is present in this game where you can FORCE another player into buying an art piece. It helps if you're about to win a piece you don't want or if you want to spike up the price of your piece, but be careful. If you use a screw on a player who can't bid that high, then the screw is wasted.\n\nOverall this and the first game pack is fun. It has a lot of possibilities when playing with a pretty large crowd, plus with the new Audience function in some games it provides humongous meetups / events to have a fun game going. I could not recommend this more","February 10","true","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has several common game breaking bugs in the last 3 days, all of them relating to the copier segments. Sometimes when the overheat button is on, meaning dont touch anything or you lose, it never goes away, which means you just lost and have to restart. Then, on Day 15, not only can this happen, but the copier segment often just doesnt start, this has happened repeatedly and is inexcusable.\n\nEDIT: so i legit forgot I made this review, the game has long sicne been fixed, i now fully reccomend the game, bomb corp is fun now that it works, I actually like ear wax, fibbage is great of course, i really enjoy bidiots even though i prefer drawful, and as for quiplash, well, if you can get a full group it is good, but even with 4 people that is not a large enough number to really enjoy it","October 28, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
