Both horizontal and vertical rotation.\nI have a problem with the text. I can't read all the words. Maybe it's just me.\nFor a puzzle game lover, this one should be on your list.","January 19","true","0.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

This game is one of the better puzzle games I have played in a long time. If you are looking for a hidden golden gem buried along with thousands and thousands of games in the store, this is one of them.\n\nThe graphics are very gorgeous, futuristic, and minimalist all at the same time which gives you a feeling of calm and peace. Awesome.\n\nMy favorite part of this game is that it gives me a feeling of being a foreigner in a very unknown and confusing world. The confusing and foreign texts are well done that they really made me feel like a foreigner struggling to find a way out of an unknown country.\n\nNow, how are the puzzles? The puzzles in general are very well done. Sometimes they require plenty of second thoughts and deeper thinking as the puzzles get harder and harder. The awesome combination of blue/orange trigger weapon, jumping platforms, and large trigger objects that changes the dimensions and gravity is insane fun. That was what I was looking for when I bought this game.\n\nBasically, this game is a baby of Fez and Portal. If you like those games a lot, you will like this game without a doubt.\n\nStill blows my mind how criminally underrated this game is. Solid puzzle game.\n\n8 out of 10","January 26","true","3.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Talk about a beautiful game. If you are into puzzle and exploration games, this is right up in your alley. In the same field as Portal, this hidden gem is easily comparable to some of the greatest puzzle games out there. Although there are some small flaws in the game, it doesn't stop it from being as great as it is.\n\nJumping right into the game, you are welcomed by a simplistic, yet perfect menu. It shows the title of the game and there are a very small amount of sub-menus. The rest of the screen is covered by a neat animation of one of the rotary blocks. The only issue I had with the menu was the text, and this bothered me throughout the entire game. I think it could be made more legible with the used of an outline for the letters or simply just making the text bolder.\n\nThe music in the menu was great, and is great throughout the game. One thing I did notice, and this is because I am a musician therefore am very picky with the music, but there was a lack of low end. The music could have been a little more bassy. Also, I only noticed this during the main menu, but at the end of the song, there was a crackling. This could have been intentional though, I am not too sure.\n\nIn the options menu, I wasn't able to change the graphics quality in the visual details option. It was set to low and I was trying to set it higher. This changed after a minute of hitting all the buttons on the keyboard, but the cursors were still a little messed up.\n\nThe game starts off with a beautiful cutscene showing off the environment of the game. Now I do love watching these cutscenes, but some people don't. I think the lazy gamers should be able to skip cutscenes.\n\nAnomaly requires more thinking rather than throwing you in constant action. You will be challenged with many obstacles, and unfortunately there is no tutorial, so you will be sent out to figure the game out on your own. Now, I don't like this approach, but some people might. I think a tutorial could be implemented somehow in the game. It took me very long to figure out how to work the game.\n\nOne last small thing is the aiming. I think the sensitivity should be adjustable and I also think that the hitbox for the rotary cubes should be made bigger. The precision in your shooting sometimes has to be a little too perfect.\n\nThere isn't much to complain about when it comes to actual game play. This game plays and looks beautiful. I am very impressed by this game. I see this game becoming very successful if the developers listen to what the gamers have to say. I think also bringing down the price (in the current state that is is), or adding it to indie game bundles, could bring in some more attention to the game and maybe some critical acclaim. I give this game an 8 out of 10.","April 24","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You really have to think and just sole puzzles, and the music and atmosphere of the game really helps you unwind and really think clearly. I would recomend this game to somebody that is either into puzzle games or trying to learn how to approach things differently.","January 3","true","1.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

The mechanics are very crisp and moving around your avatar "ano" is suprisingly gratifying.

The visuals are amazing for an indie game at this price and I think with a little more polish it could be a really great Portal clone.  Too many bugs spoiled it for me though.

"Third person, 3D-space-rotating puzzle"; well played Dev, well played.\n- About setting, there are no in-game brightness or gamma setting. It was really really dark, darker than a horror game until I manually setting my screen's gamma and brightness. Not a real problem.\n- There are no tutorial or clue about how I play this game, or the exit sign and enter sign, or how the gun works. You need to explore yourself, which is a good thing in puzzle game.\n- Firstly I thought this game is not optimized well until I realized that this one built on UE4. My bad, my rigs is a little bit outdated. But most of you will experience it well. It looks beautiful!\n\nBottom lineGrab this one if you want to feel high on "Third person, 3D-space-rotating mind-warping three-dimensional" puzzle.\nNot just a great puzzle game, this one is a really great piece of art.","April 29","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mijatodd/recommended/424320/","mijatodd","Waffles©","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mijatodd/","254 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThere's not a whole lot I can say about this game.  It has simple puzzle mechanics and a fairly cookie-cutter story.  That being said, what simple things it does, it does well.  The primary setting is an open room with a entrance and an escape and your goal is the reach said exit.  Most of the puzzles involve hitting lever #1 to invert gravity or shooting lever #2 to rotate platforms.  There's a lot of trial and error in the steps but it is honestly one of the most rewarding things to beat one of the levels in the game and continue on.  Graphically the game is beautiful, although I do admit that my favorite color is blue and the game incorporates a lot of blue and purple.  There's something magical and forlorn about the art style that makes me want to continue playing the game.  Unknown words and strange structures have a enchanting effect on a game, although it is a style that many devs fall on.  That being said if you are looking for a game that focuses more on design choices, clever puzzle placement, and not too much story than I recommend Anomaly 1729 for it's safe, but somehow unique, take on the genre.","May 27","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
