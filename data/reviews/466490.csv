"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/466490/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","Princess Isabella: The Rise of an Heir is the last game in the titular series, and probably the weakest game in means of gameplay dynamic, puzzle choices and story elaboration to begin with. It was in the Steam Store for ages alongside other two games before Artifex Mundi got the rights from Gogii Games to remaster. The old original game - a cheesy, yet okay conclusion to otherwise beautiful series - is sadly not acquirable through the Steam Store anymore. This is the remaster arranged by Artifex Mundi, and even though that I'm a fan of the publisher, I'll go out on a limb and declare that they didn't even try to make a decent job here.\n\nSpoiler Alert! Isabella's last battle with the witch didn't end happily. Yes, she managed to rescue Bella with the aid of her companions, yet her momentary distraction costed her everything. The witch turned her into a stone statue, Prince Adam completely lost his mind and the kingdom has fallen under the tyrannical rule of the witch... Yet, in a silent and peaceful corner of the realm, three fairy godmothers and the dragon raised little Bella to be a capable wizardess just like her mother, for her to return and complete the deed that her mother failed to do so. Upon finally discovering Bella's location, the witch sends her hounds after Bella, and her hurry to clean this mess begins... Will there be a happily ever after, after all?\n\nLet's start with the display options. The old original - just like previous games - was weaved out of pastel colors, dusty environments and all pictures carried an elegant shimmer. With new rendering of the images, filter and tone choices for colors got bolder and shinier. As a personal choice, I found that a bit of an unnecessary contrast with the original setting, lessening the atmosphere. Quoting from a friend's comment: "Pictures look like Walt Disney threw up all over the place." Well, that is kinda appropriate of a definition here. I usually adore Artifex Mundi's color choices, yet playing prior games it felt unfitting for Isabella series' elegance and naivety. Resolutions compared to the old game are marvelously better though, I won't lie. Art works and HOG scenes are much clearer, and it got a lot much easier to go through item fetching.\n\nSome great annoyance on my part was that some voice acting got changed - to a lesser quality, surprisingly - and others are completely missing. Some character introduction scenes and other cutscenes are cut out, leaving small holes in the original plotline. The setting was overwhelmed with the concept of catholic evil to begin with - cleansing the evil out of all places that we run through, wickedly laughing villain, Eye of Sauron-ish watching eye of the witch, a curse so sticky that it takes 3 games to clean thoroughly - and not very original about it. Cutting out content leaves it fatally wounded. Sure, we are lucky that this is a collector’s edition which offers some bonus gameplay and references to older games, but I'd appreciate if I'd be able to see mandrake's introduction scene or hear the voice of the whale that resides on the beach.\n\nHOG scenes got a heck lot of easier with lesser items to find on cleaner picture renderings. They are mostly redone with the same items. Puzzles are altered too; some getting ridiculously easier, others unnecessarily complicated. Item interface has also been changed with your wand being in dangerous proximity to hint button; just be warned. I do not recall whether there was a map or not, but I certainly hadn't any need for it. The environment itself is somewhat limited anyhow with a backtracking being mandatory.\n\nOverall, this is most certainly not one of Artifex Mundi's better games, neither the best game in Isabella series anyhow. I could recommend the game only if you've played previous games and curious about what will happen to Isabella in the end. Even then, I recommend finding and playing the original through Big Fish Games.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","May 14","false","2.7"," 53 of 57 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","53","57","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/466490/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","I'm not going to say that I was kinda excited to see Artifex Mundi pick this one, because this is the worst title in the series of Princess Isabella. Indeed, it was previously on Steam and I've played the "old" version. Be aware that I would have given a neutral rating if I could. If anything, there are better titles in Artifex Mundi's catalogue, so if you can avoid this one if you're a non-English player, do it. I'm still doing a positive review but the line is thin. Also, as I've said, I've played the previous release in English, which is why I was more sure of the positive than the negative than for this release.\n\nYears after Princess Isabella saved her daughter thanks to her fairy friend and the little dragon and became a statue because of the evil witch, the kingdom is waiting for someone to defeat that person. Bella, now in age and learning about her lineage, is ready to deliver her parents from their fate though her godmothers got kidnapped and jailed by the evil witch...\n\nThe plot is still the same from the previous games: you have to purge scenes of all evil or to reconstitute portraits to save people in it (here, you have mainly the godmothers). You have also a magic wand to break stuff and also acquiring powers thanks to the fairies once free. You can also use a music instrument to call the dragon to lift heavy items.\n\nThe gameplay is very classic though, with hidden objects scenes and puzzles, that are quite easy to play. While I loved the first part of the game, once I've reached the castle, I was kinda bored and once on the beach, it was worse. Everything is kinda easy, but the hidden object scenes tended to have objects partially hidden. What I find interesting was the little mandagore figures to help. It has precious objects and well, they're not too much annoying, because they weren't invading the game.\n\nThe graphics are quite good, I loved the little mandragores though I hated the spider, too big for my taste. The voice actings for the dragon, the fairy or the witch are correct but the godmothers... Not only they looked like the same but I can't say I was charmed by their voice. However, I have a little complaint for the graphics: they were kinda looking like grainy. I wonder if it's because Artifex Mundi adapted it for widescreens (as it's a possibility that the previous release was still in 4/3 ratio) or if it's because the new HUD, which was way more colorful, is making this being more highlighted.\n\nI appreciated the soundtrack too.\n\nHowever, there is a major problem for anyone playing in another language than English: the poor translation. It's unusual from Artifex Mundi to release a game with so many bad translations that it's becoming not understanble or playable (it was horrible in the hidden objects scenes). I think that the people that redid a little the game used Google Translate. Bad idea. Very bad idea. In the end, some parts of the story didn't make sense as the sentences weren't rightly build and I know that pipe can be translated as tuyau in French, but a smoking pipe is also called a pipe in French. Without forgetting that pinecone (pomme de pin in French) got translated in céramique (a vase/pot). It's not worse than in Demon Hunters but at least, there, it was mainly the hidden objects scenes that were affected, not the story.\n\nI've thumbed up the game in English, despite being mixed about it. I've enjoyed some parts and it stayed true with this re-release. I admit that the fact that it's a collector's edition is helping. Next time, Artifex, make sure that you checked the translations. Usually, you're managing well with them. I was hoping to have my mind changed about this game and I'm still at the same point: should I thumb it down because of my own playthrough, knowing that the English is correct, because of my previous experience or should I thumb it up, because, despite this, the game is still enjoyable?\n\nI'm barely putting a thumb up. If you're playing in English, you should be fine. For other languages, I can't say. For French players, I've made a little guide with the right translations. It should be easier for you to play with that.","May 14","true","4.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/recommended/466490/","thecyberdruid","TheCyberDruid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/","4925 products in account","This is a quite short and repetitive game. The story is cringeworthy (but at least they included the eye of Sauron...) and that the names are simply 'owl', 'fairy' and 'dragon' (really their *names* are that) shows the lack of imagination that went into the game. The presentation shows that the video sequences weren't touched at all (if you play a non 4:3 resolution you'll see what I mean) and the voice acting is quite amateurish. Compared to the original (which was only a dollar on Steam) there's trading cards, achievements and a questionable bonus chapter to be had.\n\nThe game isn't fun to play to begin with, but the really weak 'update' (most of the puzzles were just dumbed down to a point were you only have to click a few times) makes it hard to recommend at any price. If this is part of a bundle you might want to pick it up, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend to get it.","May 13","false","7.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/466490/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Product received for free\n\nPrincess Isabella: The Rise of an Heir is a re-release of a game of the same title previously available on Steam. Now in the hands of a different publisher, the game has been given a bit of modernization while still retaining its charm. This title is the third in a series of hidden object games centered around a woman named Princess Isabella, however this time you take the role of her daughter Bella. I’ve played the game before and played it again for this review, as well as played this release twice so I’ll do a little bit of comparing as I go along.\n\nThe story remains unchanged, Bella’s mother, Isabella, previously fought against an evil witch to protect the kingdom but was turned to stone when Bella was a baby. The witch has finally found the child, despite the protection of her fairy godmothers and now Bella must follow in the steps of her mother to save the kingdom. The story in the game is very basic- it wasn’t good before, and it’s still not very good. The characters all have uninspired names; Bella, Owl, Dragon, Fairy, and have personalities to match. Bella never says anything, not to other characters and even to herself so we have no idea what kind of a person she actually is. This updated version brings collector edition bonus not previously available on Steam, including a bonus chapter. You learn more about what happened to the people in the kingdom after the witch’s curse and tie things up a little bit but this still doesn’t add much of anything to the story.\n\nThis is a mouse-controlled hidden item game, you point and click on items and people to interact with them as well as to move around. You collect useful items to progress through the game while solving puzzles and playing hidden item scenes. The scenes are good and offer some fun and sometimes a challenge but none are too difficult at all. The mini games on the other hand have been insanely dumbed down from the previous release with some being omitted all together. The game has been made entirely too easy in my opinion. One of the omitted puzzles I didn’t like anyway, but the mini games have become boring. While some of the changes aren’t too bad, most might just make hidden object game veterans feel a little insulted.\n\nI found that the audio wasn’t changed much, if at all, from the previous release. The music is all the same, the voice acting is all the same as well. This is a bit of a shame because the voice acting isn’t that great. It’s not bad but there could have been some better direction and actors. One note, a certain old man in the story has not the best sounding mic quality. It doesn’t say much so it’s not critical but I did notice this. The art was also unchanged except for making things look crisper. Certain items in the game were moved but it effects nothing. The artwork is nice, very magical and fitting but dated. The user interface had a huge graphical update, everything is smoother looker and more up to date with current hidden item game standards. The menu, your inventory, speech bubbles and such look pretty good.\n\nIn all honesty I didn’t like this title when it was released before, I found it to be the weakest in the trilogy so I was excited for this remake...however it’s not a remake at all, just a re-release. It does improve on some areas, like giving you a map, but if you’ve played the game before you don’t need this unless for the achievements and trading cards. If you’ve never played this title before, maybe grab it on sale. This game would be good for younger fans, especially with the level of difficulty being so low but more avid fans of this genre should probably find another title to play.\n\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","May 24","false","3.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

It's too easy compared to other games of the same genre.\n2. There is not a lot of music. I was hoping for a more varied soundtrack.\n3. The storyline is too childish, and what's with the generic names, like Fairy, Owl etc??? Also, the title is Princess Isabella, but the heroine is Bella, Isabella's daughter.\n4.

Okay, the instructions on the color wheel puzzle are completely useless, and it _does_ have a few "what the hell just happened?" moments, but other than that i'm finding it to be a decent HOPA, with mechanics i've not yet seen in a HOPA (e.g. the wand's abilities) and a nice atmosphere. The graphics quality is slightly sub-par for modern HOPAs (but better than the Time-whatever series), and the video cutscene quality is notably sub-par, but the voiceovers and music are well done. Some players complain about the generic names of the characters (Fairy, Owl, etc.), but i actually prefer such names over arbitrary made-up names which few players can remember. Challenging? Not particularly, but it's colorful, has relaxing music, and suitable for casual gamers. It's certainly short, though - not quite 3.5 hours for the main story plus unlockable add-on adventure.","May 14","true","3.3"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krabbenprinzessin/recommended/466490/","krabbenprinzessin","Wolferatus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krabbenprinzessin/","3355 products in account","Product received for free\n\nI got this Game for free from Dev. to review it for our Site "Die Gamer". Thanks Artifex Mundi for that.\n\nI try to review this Game without telling too much about the game, also I review this game how I liked it, no matter if I got it free or had to pay for it. I may do a few mistakes, english is not my native language and for our site I always write reviews in german.\n\nStory:\nYou play as Princess Isabella "called Bella", a young blonde princess, you have to save your mother, she was kidnaped from an evil witch, who can look beautiful and ugly in the same second. On your side is a Dragon, the three Elfes and an Owl who help you beat the witch.\n\nOn an extra Level, after finished the Base Game you need to do some work and help peoples who died and still live in the castle as ghosts.\n\nGameplay:\nIts a typical Hidden Object Game. (similar with Point and Click games). With a lot of different puzzels. You can always skip a puzzle if its to hard for you to solve it. Also there are hints when you dont know what to do next. Most puzzles are repetitive, like the one where you have to search obejcts. (mostly the same objects on this puzzels too) Also story lets the end with your father open, if you like to hear more about him, you need to finish the bonus game as well. All achivements are easy to get, there is no achivement for finishing the bonus mission.\n\nYou can choose how to play, you have 3 options like easy, normal, hard.\n\nGraphic:\nWell, its a bit hard to say because its not an AAA Titel or a game where you realy need a big graphic. You see mostly only moving Pictures not an 3D animation. Drawings are nice, but there are a few pictures who doesnt look good, at least not on full screen. They are to pixelated, what is realy sad because the game is good. There is no graphic setting but you can choose how load youz want the music and SFX and if you like to play on fullscreen or window mode.\n\nHow long is the Game:\nEveryone playes different and need more or less time solving the puzzles, for me on the hardest gameplay, it took me ~4 hours with the base game and the extra missions. I didnt skipped the puzzles or used hints.  I have to say that I played a lot of Point and Click games before, they are much harder to beat then hidden object games, and this one was made realy easy compair to other games from AM.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you like hidden object games or like games where you can relax, just buy it, you will enjoy it, even if its to easy for you. Some puzzles are realy nice and clever done, graphic is mostly okay and the story is good. Gameplay time was for me a bit short but I think 4-6 hours is not bad at all. If you don`t like to pay 7,99€ because its not enough gameplay time for you then waite for a 50% sale, I think its worth to play.\n\nYou can also buy it and try it max. 2 hours, if its not your game you can refunde it on steam.\n\nI would give this Game for a Hidden Object Game a 7 from 10 points. If you care about graphic then a 6 of 10 points. I enjoyed the game and can recommend it to play but only if you like relax games and hidden object games.\n","May 23","true","3.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
