Magnetic by Nature is a sidescrolling platformer with a magnetic driven twist, facing the player against complex chains of positive and negative reactions they must properly attract to and repel from in order to reach the end of each thoughtfully crafted stage.\n\nEach of the large robot idols you must revive and unlock play host to a series of refreshingly difficult levels of their own colorful and entrancing environment. Guided by the shimmering melodies echoing with cave-like and natural qualities, droplets of water heard lightly dripping from hanging stalactites in the background. The game has beautiful and engaging surroundings that seem to live and breathe around you, with the glistening surfaces of twisting rock formations with occasional flocks of birds flying by all drawing you into the wonderfully relaxing mood of each differently themed setting.\n\nMere movement in Magnetic by Nature requires the sharpest wit and the quickest reactions, propelling yourself across wide cavernous gaps and attempting to quickly reverse polarity to catch yourself on another magnet and swing even further. As you learn the ropes of using your magnetic charge to slingshot yourself around each stage with ease, the momentum speeds up and swinging yourself across stages becomes an exhilarating trapeze act.\n\nOften times the game moves far beyond mere platforming and into ingenious and accessible puzzle mechanics, having you push and pull magnetic orbs into proper slots or even through complicated stone mazes. Throughout the entirety of the game I was surprised with how fresh and engaging the new mechanics brought by each level were, never feeling same-y or overstaying its welcome.\n\nThe game quickly becomes intensely difficult, but in the best ways possible that offer an accessible challenge which always feels within your grasp.  What starts out as quick and clever manipulations of magnetic force in order to reach a nearby platform soon turns into long and complicated series of chained magnets strung above dangerous obstacles and deadly contraptions.\n\nThe retries will come swiftly, as you practice on perfecting the aim and arc of your propelled movements from each magnet to the next, timing your swings between them just right. It doesn't take long to figure out how to wield this unique mechanic, and completing the most puzzling labyrinth of magnets is always an incredibly rewarding feeling.\n\nMagnetic by Nature is a game that deserves to discovered and played by a much wider audience. I'm ashamed I hadn't played it earlier myself, as it has proved to be one of the most pleasantly original platformers of the year. The consistently challenging and unusual mechanic of harnessing magnetic power to slingshot yourself to victory combined with an earthly atmosphere unsurpassed in its natural charm make this absolutely worth the admission.","December 11, 2014","true","4.4"," 42 of 45 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","42","45","0","1"

Each level only contains one 'flower' to acquire and an exit.  The split second difference between when you use a push/pull combined with the distance you are from the magnet determines how quickly you can propel yourself or cause drag on yourself becomes super frustrating while trying to get through the levels.\n\nI played all the way through the first group of 25 levels to unlock the first giant robot, played one more of the next robot's next 25 levels (which introduced a new thing where the magnets can or can't pass through certain color areas) and could not bring myself to play more.\n\nIf you like challenging twitch/reaction 'platform' games with lots of dying/retrying you might like this, but I didn't.","January 19, 2015","false","1.3"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","24","35","2","0"

In Magnetic by Nature you play a metal robot, with the ability to switch it's polarity in order to be repelled or attracted to magnets in the game and that is your most important skill! It takes a bit of time to get used to it and, I'm not gonna lie - it might be a little frustrating in the start, but once you've mastered it, you'll start enjoy the fluid motion and the level design!\nThere are quite a few levels in the game - by now I have unlocked 5 hubs with 25 levels each. Granted, some of the levels require a couple seconds to beat and in some you need to be really precise in your skill ( read : really really tough, borderline infuriating :p ). In each level there is a bonus objective, that's usually tough to get. If you get the objective and don't beat the level, it will still be there next time, taunting you again, but if you got it and complete the level, you won't see it again. Gladly there is an option to reset all your progress, which I really really like and find very useful (for all the let's players out there <3 ).\nAlthough there are no online leaderboards for the game, there are rankings for each individual level. Your rank for a specific level is determined from the time you need to complete it, compared to other players out there. The fastest time and individual are displayed below your rank, on the level info screen. Now, I would like something done better about this : The time is counted from the moment you load the level to the moment you reach it's goal. I would love, if there was a small countdown, or at least a half a second of get ready - here is where you start moment, as in a lot of levels instant movement is required to achieve a respectable time. Also, if you fail the first time the level is loaded, you'll respawn reasonably fast without the loading screen, but your time won't be reset. So in order to get a top rank, you need to wait for that loading screen and fully reset the level every time you fail, and I think this could be done better.\nThere are unlockable speedrun game+ , game ++ modes for all you speed runners out there. I've only unlocked the game+ mode : as you start it a timer will appear in the top right corner counting your total time - and you start from the first hub/tutorial levels. As a lot of levels take under 5 seconds to complete, but more than 3 seconds to load on my machine, I would guess, that a fast pc/ssd/ram will have a significant impact on your time, and I don't like that.\nThe game always shows "press A/Y" to do something, even when your gamepad is unplugged and it took me some time to realize that Esc is the key to replay a level, while Space/Enter is the key to resume. Also I would love to see an option - go back to level hub on that particular screen( replay level / next level).\nThe controls in general feel good on both keyboard and gamepad, but I stuck to my keyboard + mouse as I found those better suited for me. While experimenting to find out what keys I need to press to replay/go next level, I found out a "secret" ?! : If you press ctrl+F10 you open something that looks like a level designer. I haven't played around with it too much, but if they implement it in some point, the game would definitely benefit from it!\nThe game is hard, don't kid yourself. There will be people raging at it, for sure ;) A lot of patience will be required, but I still think, it's worth it, as I found it very satisfactory to see myself @ rank 1 on a couple of levels :p\n\nTL:DR you can check my overview video here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=339955130\n","November 10, 2014","true","3.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

I recommend the game itself, but the package itself seems a bit flaky. For example, I had to close the game after opening it for the first time to bind a keyboard control to actually enter levels. Once I did that, however, I had a lot of fun.\n\n[[Edit: The following paragraph was written when I picked the game up. As of this edit, these issues are either fixed, or being worked on.]] Leaderboards are not fantastic in this game. Apparently all times get stored so you can see your own rank, but you can't see any other players' times except for rank one. Furthermore, there seemed to be issues with connecting to the leaderboards after levels. There also seemed to be issues with displaying the correct leaderboard, as I would get the wrong rank one time displayed after completing a level. There *also* appears to be cheating on some of the leaderboards, unfortunately, but I can't hold this one against the devs. It's an online game. It happens. Speaking of which, why is there an achievement for getting rank 1 on a leaderboard? That's never a good idea. :(\n\nLastly, and maybe this is just me being bad at the game, but I don't feel like slingshotting off of blue anchor points feels intuitive or responsive at all. I struggled more than I felt I should have to get them to fling me. [[Edit: I can confirm it was me being bad. It feels natural and fluid after playing for longer.]]\n\nOverall, I think this is a fun, well-made game that just happens to fall a bit short in its ability to keep players playing after completing it.","January 24, 2015","true","32.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/296510/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Magnetic By Nature isn't a terrible game; on the contrary, it's a somewhat fresh and original platformer! Unfortunately, the pacing and level design, coupled with some bugs and horrible interface made the game boring to me. It was simply not fun, and that's the only reason I'm not recommending.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, and you may very well get some enjoyment out of it, if you enjoy platformers! It's rather easy, with most levels being completed in less than 3 restarts, a couple of more difficult ones not passing 15. And I'm not that good at platformers.\n\nI'll just briefly explain each aspect I did (or not) enjoy.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around magnets, as the name suggests. You can be attracted or repeled (and attract and repel some objects). It's unique, as far as I know, and it did provide some interesting sections.\nThe level design, however, lacks a lot of pacing and progression. It seems like just a bunch of random level thrown together. The first two worlds introduced mechanics; that last 3 didn't.\nIf you look at Super Meat Boy, there's clearly a lot of thought into teaching the player how to overcome certain obstacles that are recurring in later level, in a harder form.\nIn this game, levels are very, very gimmicky. It's about a quirky feature of the physics system that helps you complete the level, but not really a challenge. And all of the levels are like that, for the most part. There isn't an obstacle that you have to learn, really. It's just... a bunch of levels. And for me, that wasn't fun at all, it just felt like a drag.\n\nThe controls are a bit floaty, which I didn't like very much.\nThen, there's how levels work: there's a collectible in every level. Some are really easy to get and go well with the level. Others are just completely out of the way. Meh, it can provide a bit more challenge, but I don't feel like it added a whole lot.\n\nThe bugs include getting stuck (in mid air, for some reason), leaderboards not seeming to work, levels completed not tracking properly, sometimes, etc.\nThe getting stuck one was particularly annoying, as it happened several times, for no reason.\n\nThe game encourages speedruns, looking at the achievements. That would be really cool! ... If the leaderboards worked. I've never been able to see how other players did in their levels. Which kind of defeats the point. The game wasn't very interesting for me to speedrun it either.\n\nWhat I mean by horrible interface is how cluttered it is when explaining very simple controls, and how unresponsive and inflexible the menus are.\nFor example, there's no level selection. What you can do is go to the Hub (always resetting your position to your starting point) lose some seconds (or minute) traversing to the world you want, and then select a level. But, if you're in a level already, you NEED to go abck to the Hub to select another one. And it's a waste of time! When you finish a level, you only have two options: restart, or go to the next level. Nothing else.\nThere are other problems I could mention, but it's not worth it.\n\nAgain, even though my review was very negative, it's not a terrible game. Read other reviews: people seem to like, and that's cool! I'm just writing about my experience with it. Some of the levels were fun, but most were completely forgettable and not challenging.\n\nThe other individual aspects are great! The artstyle (although I have some reservations) was pretty good, the soundtrack was very good as well, and used properly, keeping you in the flow of the game.\nI just didn't have any fun, by end.","July 27, 2015","false","4.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I got this game in a bundle and am pleasantly surprised, would have payed the full price as well had I stumbled upon this earlier. After experiencing about half of the game ( playing through all lvls casually, not looking for  good times) I can REALLY recommend this game.\n\nGraphics look nice and give a good ambience to the game,  music surrounds it well as it is AWESOME.\n\nTL&DR : DEFINETIVELY worth the money especially if you are into hard platformers, grinding for the optimal time. The mechanics are interesting. So far, the game  has been a blast for me.\n\nHaving completed all the basic stages now, i can stress it even further: This game is awesome. Get it.

Magnetism.\nYou can attract yourself to these magnets or attract them to you in order to position them properly to pass through the level. You can repel yourself off them or repel the magnet itself into a favorable position. Depending on what series of levels you are doing there are additional mechanics that interact with the magnets to offer more gameplay variety.\n\nHow dose it "feel" like ?\n\nHow can i describe this to you... it feels.. relaxing...harmonious if you will. It gives off a vibe i only found in Journey (yes i'm willing to go that far!)\nThe graphics are simple but classy and don't steal you away from the game itself and the music sets the "laid back" atmosphere of the game.\n\nWhat am i supposed to do ? Where is the difficulty ?\n\nEnjoy the experience, just sit back in the comfort of your chair or couch (fully playable with mouse and keyboard, keyboard alone and 360 controller) and just go through the game without trying to achieve anything, just go with the flow.\nTiered after a long day at work ? had one of those days ? Want to take a blunt object and re-arrange your bosses anatomy ? Fire-up MBN and unwind, belive it or not it can work wonders.\nThe difficulty dose not come in the shape of "how hard it is to pass a level" but in "how fast can you finish a level".\n\nStory ?\n\nThrough a short but heart-warming intro that shows a little robot all alone and sad because he cant reactivate one of his robot friends MBN got me more interested then triple-A 5 minute intros. I genuinely wanted to repower my sad looking robot friend. Can't get that feeling in CoD now can you ?...\nThat's all i have to say because i don't want to spoil anymore.\nIn my opinion this is how "lore" should be done in a platformer, short, to the point and effective. Not many people play platformers for the lore, most do it for gameplay... don't you ?\n\nMy thoughts ?\n\nIt's one of the few original releases i seen all year.\nConsidering the price, the feel, the look and the new mechanics... It's a no-brainer.\nIf you chose not to give it a shot then you will be missing out on a great experience.\n\nFor clearer view you can check out my first impressions video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPEC1zEnKpM&list=PLPu1MBLqtny7rnijEzJ3bPSEMepog_rOK","November 10, 2014","true","4.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

The art style is simple and beautiful and the music is atmospheric. The gameplay does take a little bit to get used to but is very fun. I've finished the main 4 zones, and have yet to pass the first level of zone 5. It is a bonus zone for a reason, zone 5 is HARD. I like how they've added "collectibles" to, well, collect. Usually trying to get them increases the difficulty of the level.\n\nThere are bugs:\n-getting stuck in the floor or wall unable to move forcing you to restart level. This doesn't happen often but is annoying. From what I understand from the dev team it would require re-coding from the ground up to fix, and it rarely happens anyway.\n-UPDATE (this has been fixed!) PC version showing Xbox controls.\n\nThis game also lacks the ability to remap keys. I have trouble with my mouse hand after an injury which made the default layout difficult. I solved this by downloading Key Remapper and rebinding Lctrl and space to simulate L and R mouse buttons enabling me to play one-handed.\n\nOverall I'll give this game a solid 4/5.

The magnetism trick lends itself to Braid-like complexity, and gives the game an amazing sense of flow when you get it down. Flinging yourself around the levels becomes second nature, which is good because you'll need fine control for a few of those bonus collectables...\n\nHighly recommended if you like puzzles or platformers.","January 25, 2015","true","4.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It seemed simple at first, but each set of stages layers on additional mechanics that will test your mastery of the little robot. I liked that the stages for the first 4 robots are all rather quickly completed, as I was able to pop through a few here and there and have a nice time. The 5th set of stages are clearly designed with the intent of testing your skills in the harshest way possible. I have found them to be incredibly challenging, but not unfair - not something I could not have said had I jumped into them without the first 4 stages teaching me how to finesse the controls.","March 13, 2015","true","7.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I found myself doing the “just one more level” talk more than once! This looks to be a port from a console or mobile platform, hence the short levels.\n\nI find this game similar to “Defy Gravity” in that you can either repel or attract yourself to applicable parts/objects of the level to complete it. There is a very simple story of you waking up your robot friends by completing all the levels within them. Teaching of the game mechanics is done very well. It eases you into new concepts and obstacles. A quick tip may appear but the rest is on the player to discover how it works and improve from there.\n\nThe first 4 zones range from easy to intermediate. I never felt like I couldn’t do a level and some required a good amount of thinking for a solution. The fifth zone, which is unlocked after you beat the other 4, is very difficult. I could only beat a handful of levels and ended up calling it quits at that point.\n\nI did glitch more than once and got stuck in a freefall animation while being on the ground. This forced me to restart the level. Luckily the levels are short so there’s not much frustration had.\n\nPros\n+Buttery smooth 60fps\n+Scaled to 1440p nicely\n+Nice colorful visuals\n+Great learning curve and teaching of mechanics\n+Fun short levels\n+I actually wanted to collect the collectables\n\nCons\n+Pressing “Y” to retry a level on my Xbox controller didn’t work\n+Got stuck in a freefall while on the ground more than once\n+Majority of the achievements are speedrun related\n+Controls could be tighter and more responsive (personal preference)\n\nWhile the $9.99 price seems high, it’s definitely a fun puzzle game to pick up if you enjoy the genre. I’d absolutely recommend it in a bundle or when on sale.\n\n7/10","December 17, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
