I believe I'm in the minority when I say this, but I oh so strongly believe it.\n\nCompared to the original Cossacks video game, it's distinctly different. The visual style, gameplay/gamefeel, and even the setting are radically different from Cossacks: The Art of War. It's not hard to see why fans didn't like this one or it's vanilla version. But if you really give it a chance and look at it as a nonsequel, you may see a very good game in it.\n\nFor those not in the know, the overall series has features like troop morale, limited ammunition for gunpowder weapons, commanding and management of troop formations, and a visual style that invokes the image of paintings from the era coming to life. It's an extreme different game from say, Age of Empires or Total War, despite the simularities. The learning curve is slightly higher than those games aswell. Battles are often stalemates that have to be broken through concentrated attacks, flanking, and clever usage of terrain features.\n\nThis game is more or less dead and its developer, GSC Gameworld (Who is known more as the team behind the STALKER franchise of FPS games), is in a state of pseudo non-existance. But please, buy this game. It deserves more love and attention!\n\nAdd me if you want to play multiplayer sometime, I would greatly appreciate that.\n\nAnd for anyone who disagrees with me on the games quality, come on, at least it's not as bad as Napoleon: Total War...","March 21, 2014","true","24.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Cossacks 2 bfe has all what a strategy loving player needs. You have fast economy (building your base in 10 minutes). Massive battles with over 5000 units!!! Perfect tactics, units have formations, morale, stamina.\nRealistic terrain tactics, like trees make you lose accuracy, you cant shoot over building (only artillery), standing on highland increases the range of your units, units can lose formation and be forced to flee. Each unit can either shoot and reload or fight melee.\nRealistic economy, shooting is based on resources, you have to have coal to reload. Units can die if you have no food. To get resources you have to defeat and control villages, resources are delivered by mules which gives another tactical advantage.\n\nOverall i rate this game 8/10 because it is military/tactic focused. Graphic has practically no requirements. Gives you massive battles and lots of tactical possibilities.\n\nMinus:\nSingle player - AI is plain stupid\nMultiplayer - very few players\n\nBuy this game, and tell your friends to buy it too, get more players because this game is worth saving!\n\ngl&hf","July 20, 2014","true","16.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Overall the graphics aren't bad, what you would expect for a game of it's type and genre. It feels generic when you play, but that could be due to the sheer volume of similar games all aspiring to be the next big Age of Empires hit. In my opinion, there are so many of these types of games out there, this one doesn't do anything extraordinary to set itself apart and thus doesn't earn a thumbs up.

You will be able to make squads of 120 troops with or without an officer, drummer or banner carrier to help with Morale and fatigue. The game has you build a town like an rts but you have to build at least 120 musketmen to have a squad. Having a squad is more effective then individual units and comes with great benifits. When you have a squad (Or lines) you can give them differant formations such as Box, collum or line. Line is the more traditional fighting style, putting your men into three rows and having either one fire at a time at your command or having them all fire. Next is collum which has your men form a collum to march in. This game has fatigue and morale, using collum and having them go on a road helps them with these. For example a squad in line thats marching takes more fatigue then a squad going in collum formation. The last is the box formation which you use if you are either surrounded or have cavalry charging. The combat is very interesting and somewhat challenging as it has you either hold formation and fire when they are close, or you move forward and fire when you are close to them. There are three ranges, green (Long), yellow (medium), and red (Close). As these are muskets, green does the least amount of damage and the least morale damage. Yellow is the second highest and red is the highest as it will go. Keep in mind that firing at the wrong time can and will infact screw you out of a squad. One good volley and your men may break. Your infantry can also "entrench" positions. This is not exactly like digging entrenchments but they are seen crouching and kind of preparing. In this form they do more melee damage if charged at, have a higher morale and can take more of a beating. Melee is used if you know you can break an enemy squad quickly, some are better then others so watch out. Treelines and forests can help/hurt your infantries accuracy, as it gives an increased chance of missing their targets. The next thing is the Artillery. Artillery features cannons and for the British, rockets. Cannons and rockets have an OK accuracy hit rate but can definatly miss completely. Cannons can use either round shot (Default) or scatter shot which can be used for up close combat or a charging enemy. Cannons when they hit deal massive damage to both troops and morale, causing them to break easy IF they hit. They are also slow to deploy so you can make a type of carrier for them to go faster, those these are somewhat weird as they may just freeze in place and not mount the cannons at all. Cavalry is great at melee and ok at range as you would've guessed. The AI is challenging...If not a little stupid. Sometimes the AI will charge you, using massive amounts of squads, some artillery and cav. But sometimes they will march straight infront of your line only to have their squad get shot and break with ease. It is a very challenging game but its very fun to play.

Sounds like Shia is writing this review but he wouldn't be wrong this game is awesome. The game is fun and user friendly and although dated I kinda still like the style. Now you may see many reviews saying stuff along the lines of "the first one was better" or "down with the patriarchy" ignore those. The only way to see whether or not you will like this game is to try it, go and pirate it and try the game out. Then, if you are a good person and like the game you can buy it.\n\nAnyway on to the actual review.\n\nThe game itself is nice and has a bunch of different nations to chose from (being from the UK I play British) but there are many other good nations to chose from such as France, Poland, Austria, Spain, Rhineland, Russia and a bunch more! Each one has strengths and weaknesses, such as the British have great infantry and rifleman squads but lack great cavalry.\nThe game-play plays out like any generic RTS, build a base and all that until you realise you cant get all the resources yourself...\nThere are towns located across the maps that you must capture to gain the resources such as gold, food, iron and coal.\nWithout these you will lose, for example with no coal you will not be able to shoot. At all. So its rather important that you keep a stockpile and don't shoot unless you need to. The towns also make the combat more centralised which can lead up to some cool big battles.\nThe only gripe I have with this game is that the multiplayer is dead as it is an old game so unless you know some people who own it you will have to play single player which while fun for a while, you will bore after a while.\nThere is also a very limited amount of maps, and they can get boring after a while, especially if you are playing with multiple players as they are even more limited.\n\nAll in all I like this game and you should too (and if you don't its Obama's fault)","August 20, 2015","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","7"

The combat is laggy the whole morale idea is a very stupid one, and the way resources are controlled is just ridicoulous.

Fortunately this game is listed at the price of $4.99, so if you want to take a chance with it the price isn't that steep. For me, this game is running on my computer (which has Windows 10) with very few problems.\n\nSHORT REVIEW:\nPros:\nThis is a game that I've had a lot of fun with over the years playing both the retail version back in the day and the Steam version now. It has a decent amount of content, including an excellent "Battle For Europe" risk-style game mode. The tactical battles can become very involved and get very exciting, especially when you avoid pausing to give orders and let it all play out. It is really enjoyable to create battle formations on the fly while you are under pressure from the enemy. The game simulates basic Napoleonic warfare pretty well, and the AI is competent and can challenge you in almost every battle you fight it in. The game's graphics are really bright and look good, and the music is decent.\n\nCons:\nSome people are having serious trouble running this game on their Windows 7 or later computers. I have been fortunate enough that it has worked for me. The gameplay has typical old-fashioned RTS problems, like unit clustering and awkward base building due to size of buildings and map terrain. Also, lack of unit collision for allied units leads to awkward situations, and the fact that units block the line of fire for other units in their army can be frustrating when they start clustering together.\n\nRating:\n7/10\n\nFULL REVIEW:\nI will admit that this game is a little dated, but that hasn't stopped me from having fun playing it. This game is an RTS set in the\nNapoleonic Wars era, featuring 9 factions: France, Britain, Spain, Austria, Prussia, Confederacy of the Rhine, Poland, Russia, and Egypt. The game has three game modes: Campaign, Skirmish, and Battle For Europe. The campaigns include one for France, Rhine, Spain, and Poland. To be honest, I've never paid much attention to the campaigns. They seem like typical campaigns in an RTS game (i.e. each mission has an objective(s) and you build a base and raise armies or work with what you are given to complete the mission). Skirmish mode is where you can set up a match pitting any of the factions against each other on a premade map. Under Skirmish mode, you can also play historical battles such as Austerlitz, Borodino, and Waterloo; as well as generic battles focusing on tactics and maneuver rather than base building. Overall, it's a decent amount of content.\n\nBattle For Europe (which I hereby abbreviate as B.F.E.), in which I've spent probably 95% or more of my time playing (back in the day and now). In this mode, you play on a sort of risk-style board as one of the nine factions. This mode is a free-for-all, and the goal is to eliminate every other faction from the game. You can can declare war and make peace with whomever you want, and you can negotiate an alliance or non-aggression pact (which are both temporary) to prevent declarations of war and possibly team up on someone (beware though, as the computers can form alliances to bring you down too). The game is driven in a turn-based format. You have a single army consisting of platoons of any combination of your choice (with restrictions on the number of the same type of units). You can move this army across the board at a pace of one space per turn (unless a random event happens).\n\nWhen entering a hostile territory, it initiates a real-time battle that pre-deploys all of the units in your army and the enemy's army on a specially designed map for that territory. Gameplay in these real-time battles is essentially the same as in the campaign/skirmish battles (with the notable exclusion of base building in B.F.E. battles), which is why I've waited until now to explain how they work. On the battle map, your units are divided into platoons of infantry and cavalry, as well as single artillery guns. You can move the infantry and cavalry in different formations that fit the tactical situation. Essentially they can be described as offensive, defensive, and travelling formations. The artillery simply move, get in position, and fire. Tactics on the battle maps generally revolve around capturing/holding towns which provide resources. I find that there is always something to do, with very little downtime. When you encounter the enemy on the battlefield, this is when the most fun of all begins. You will find yourself scrambling to position your troops in the best ways possible while taking into consideration terrain, chokepoints, angles of attack and defense, formations, reinforcements, strength of your troops and the enemy troops, and so on.....ALL AT THE SAME TIME. Yes, you can pause the game and give orders, but I find it much more exciting to resist the temptation to do so and to let it all play out uninterrupted. And when the battles feature approximately 15-20 platoons per side, it starts getting really intense. Managing to create well planned and executed formations and tactics on the fly really creates a sense of achievement at the end of a battle.\n\nThe AI does a decent job with its tactics and formations as well, and understands and executes basic maneuvers rather well overall. It is also great at micromanaging and can attack you effectively on multiple fronts all at once. The game also simulates Napoleonic Wars era combat pretty well at a basic level, allowing you to order your troops to fire by line or as a whole formation; having different ranges of effectiveness for firing; ordering bayonet and cavalry charges; and the feature that morale is what mainly makes or breaks the unity of a formation, rather than trying to kill every last enemy soldier.\n\nWhen the battle is over, you return to the B.F.E. strategic map and the results of the battle are applied to the map, armies affected, and resources gained/used. This process is continued until all factions are eliminated from the game. Overall, I enjoy the Battle For Europe mode the most and I recommend this game mainly based on this mode as it is that good in my opinion.\n\nThe game does have some flaws though. As with many old RTS games, units in a battle often tend toward clustering together. Even though I've explained how you can set up well planned formations, when the fighting begins it more often than not devolves into a clustered and chaotic mess (which is how many real life battles go, however, so I don't personally view this as a serious flaw). It is in this clustered mess, though, that some of the goofiness of the game shows. Namely, there is no collision detection in the game engine for units in the same army, so they can walk right through each other as if they don't exist. This leads to awkward situations where platoons can stack on top of each other; and it's even more awkward when your cavalry charges straight at the enemy right through your soldiers without trampling them, which for gameplay reasons is a good thing, but it does take away a lot of realism. Also, while there is no friendly fire, units also cannot fire through allied units, meaning that you can inadvertently block your own shots and leave your troops vulnerable with empty firearms. Also, the fact that artillery consists of only single cannons means that they are often woefully ineffective, and quite frankly whether or not they are even worth the space in your army is seriously questionable. This is unfortunate because artillery was an extremely important part of Napoleonic warfare.\n\nOverall, this is a good game that I have had a lot of fun with, and I really hope it runs properly on your computer if you do take a chance on it.\nI rate this game at 7/10.","May 13","true","25.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
