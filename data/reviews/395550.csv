These aliens are quite into their technology, so its going to be a challenge. There is both an adventure mode and a hard, endless mode. The adventure mode is complete with a beginning cutscene, tons of different enemies, and quite a few challenging bosses. The different weapons and upgrades really do help, though if you lose all of your lives, you will lose your upgrades, so you have to have skill (not just fancy items). I really enjoyed playing this game, though I am not too great at aiming it seems. I did have a bug at the beginning where I could not see my cursor, so I could not aim well. This bug did go away after pausing and unpausing it.","March 4","true","0.5"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","4"
