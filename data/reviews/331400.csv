The greenlight page made it sound so promising but it just isn't any fun.\n\nPros\n+Nice art\n\nCons\n-Poor Voice acting\n-Unresponsive, redundant controls that can not be remapped if you are using a gmepad\n-Floaty physics\n-Sloppy animation\n-Game does not explain any systems to you other than how to jump. What are the two meters above your health meter? No idea\n-Your partner does very little other than get in your way\n-Enemies take entirely too many hits despite you needing to basically let them run into you before they are in attack range.\n\n\nThen there are just some head scratchers. Using an Xbox 360 gamepad the left trigger is used to switch from fullscreen to a window yet it does not switch it back. What does you ask? The right trigger, which is used as an inventory button.\n\nFrom the time I played it I gather that the game is trying to be a point and click adventure game with platformer elements but everything is so vague. After traveling to the girl's house you are given several quests that flash above your head but there is no way to look at them again.\n\nAs it is the game is just not worth your time. Maybe with a few fixes it could be playable but for the time being it is not worth the $5.","November 24, 2014","false","1.3"," 169 of 213 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","169","213","5","2"

Jump height is always the same whether you tap or hold the button.  You only have two melee attacks and enemies barely react to taking damage.  Animations have few frames and look awful.  Moving between areas takes the game out of windowed mode.  The red bean item either straight up doesn't work or has some unexplained caveat.\n\nCurrently Luna: Shattered Hearts does not feel remotely finished, and I'm not sure if it's even feasible at this point to patch it to an adequate state.  I can only hope that the game's systems get fleshed out better in time for Episode 2, but after this botched first chapter, it may already be too late.","November 24, 2014","false","1.4"," 52 of 62 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","52","62","0","0"

This game is hot garbage.\n\nAs a side-scrolling action game (I don't use the term Metroidvania because this isn't one) Luna: Shattered Hearts fails to deliver the kind of fidelity and tightness in terms of controls you'd come to expect from the genre. The movement is very floaty, but the bad kind of floaty. I would describe Dust: An Elysians Tale's movement as floaty, but because you have so many movement options and aerial control it ends up working out. In this game you only have one attack and you pretty much stop when you touch anything in mid-air and lose all momentum. It's not fun.\n\nEven if the controls were better the combat and other gameplay mechanics are pretty lame too. As I mentioned earlier, you only have one attack and it takes about half a second for it to actually get out once you hit the button. This would be fine if you didn't get knocked out of the animation once you get hit. It ends up with you having to just mash the attack button until the thing you're fighting dies. Which you'll probably be doing a ton of since the only "quest" in the game requires you to grind out a ton of items from enemies, which is extremely fun!\n\nThis game has a couple of "complex systems" in it but strangely enough the game doesn't actually tell you about them. There's a guide the creator has up for the game that you can check out that is extremely helpful and will probably answer every question you have about the game. The problem is it's not actually in the game. How is anyone supposed to enjoy the game to the fullest when they don't understand what any of the systems do?\n\nAll in all, this game feels more like a proof of concept than an actual finished product. If you want to play a good side-scrolling action game/Metroidvania check out; Dust: An Elysian Tale, Guacamelee, Hell Yeah! or Valdis Story: Abyssal City.","November 28, 2014","false","1.6"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","33","37","0","0"

Why?\nStarting from the very beggining, this game is very annoying. Fighting with someone not on even floor will make fights very  hard - you will miss enemy while getting hurt or enemy will just ignore you and move forward. The late option just happened to me when I was fighting my SECOND turtle (first enemy).\nWhile trying to see what I can change option all I managed to found was window mode. Too bad it's not working, because every time you move to another area (shop or house for example) game automatically changes to full screen.\nBut even if everything would be fixed, it's still at most decent game, with very decent art. There is nothing that would make this game worth to remember or look forward for another episode.","November 25, 2014","false","9.8"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","0"

I was looking forward to its release after seeing it on Greenlight.  I liked the look and the unique visual design, and it seemed like it had a lot of potential to be fun.\n\nBut it wasn't...\n\nA lot of the problems seem to stem from the way it doesn't relay important information on how to progress to the player.  It seems to be left to chance to try and figure out what needs to be done in order to get what you need to progress.  I'm not saying things should be spelled out to the player; allowing them to discover things for themselves IS a good thing to do, but at the very least, you have to help them along in some way, like providing some kind of clue as to how they can obtain the resources they need.  Other things to take into consideration is just the tediousness of combat.  Maybe what you can do is make the beetle enemies significantly weaker, but provide more of them so its easier to make use of their carcass in order to actually get needed ingredients to drop from enemies, as its really hard to get some of the hive enemies in place.\n\nAnother thing that needs to be addressed are the loose physics.  It feels like the chracter slides around too much from the momentum.  Platforming needs to have precise control, otherwise the player will be constantly falling from ledges.  Also, more control in jump height would be beneficial, like shorter taps of the button for smaller jumps.\n\nI'm not sure if this was a bug, but there was a frustrating instance during the major boss fight (with Chumbo?) where I would take constant damage for no discernable reason when I was at ground level.  At times I would get forced out of the room from the constant knockback after just entering it.  It's also too easy to exit that particular boss room by accident mid-fight.  Having the entrance/exit on an elevated platform would easily solve that issue.\n\nAs it stands, this still feels like its too early for release, and could really use more play testing.  There's a possibility of a good game in here somewhere, but it needs a lot of work before it reaches that point.","November 26, 2014","false","3.8"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","0"

I was looking through bundles and this game seemed interesting. I think in total I spent about $2.50 for the entire bundle. After playing the game for a little while I wouldn't have bought this game for $0.50.\n\nThe good:\n- Graphics look cool.\n- There is a chance for a decent story but the gameplay itself makes the possible story not worth going after.\n\nThe bad:\n- I hate this 1st episode crap, put the whole friggin game together and sell it. Make the first "episode" the demo and sell the completed copy. Not hard, easy to do and people get to test out the game before they buy it.\n- Nothing is really explained.\n- There is a pink orb that follows you around and spits out health boosts when your health gets low but no idea what it is.\n- You need to chip away at glowing blocks so you can continue to see otherwise it turns dark after a bit but nothing told me that or why I just started hacking away at things and figured it out. Keep in mind, you're underground and it appears as though your people are used to this, so why do you need to chip away at stuff to help you see when it makes more sense that you just can.\n- Nothing tells you what a save point looks like or how to find it. It's not in any place that is obvious.\n- The abilities of each character aren't explained so you don't know what anyone can do until the girl's AI kicks in (sometimes) and does something new.\n- There is a button that spits out monsters but no idea why. It really feels like the people who made this game were thinking "Crap, we need to put more monsters in to help complete the oil ingredients quest but we don't know what to do. How about we just say F*** it and put in a button. That should work."\n\n- The level you start out in has very difficult monsters considering there isn't a way to expand your HP. If you run into 1 tough monster could die very quickly. After I found the save point I wasn't as upset but running into one monster that spits out multiple other monsters that kill you really quickly is annoying and irritating. While trying to defeat the monster with the most HP, I die in a matter of seconds without much of a chance.\n\n- The girl's AI is pretty bad. It's really random about when she'll revive you but better for fighting. I was fighting the large HP monster and for the first 5 times through trying to beat it I died and she just stood there. The next couple of times she tried bringing me back once or twice then stopped. (Here's another bad thing, I kept dying because there was no way for me to get away from the green goo the other monsters were spitting out. I was brought back and instantly died again.) After a few more times of me dying the girl's AI kicked in a bit more and actually kept bringing me back until I was able to get away from the monster.\n\n- This game feels very lazy and lacks substance. It's easy to get bored while going after the second goal. Basically you need to find ingredients to make an oil to visit another person. You have no idea how to get them so you kill monsters, monsters wind up dropping some of the parts but you have no idea what monsters will drop what. After you kill the large HP monster, the monsters it spits out no longer are spit out and will reduce your chance of getting one of the needed ingredients.\n\nThat's my entire review of this game. I hope it helps people avoid this game and I hope it helps developers realize that you can't just slap stuff together and expect people to love it.","February 10, 2015","false","1.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","0"

Super floaty movement (movement speed and walking animations don't align) , moon gravity allows for insane jumps that feel like the character gets violently pulled up rather than... well... jumping. Combat is ABYSSMAL with the slowest animation I have ever seen, you can actually count the indiviual frames while not feeling ANY impact or power.

All the negative reviews are true. Combat is terrible. You will attack while running and it wont work. Jumping and controlling character feels off. The basic characters you fight early on take 10 hits just to kill 1, and they respawn. Attacking them from the back doesn't hurt them for some reason, and the hitboxes don't really make sense. In order to hit them from the front you have to get in range to get attack from them, and you have no knowledge of when they are going to attack, meaning you just sit right in from of them spamming attack while they attack you. Interacting is poorly done too, as the game doesn't explain how to talk to people. It also doesn't explain any systems of the game, but the guy did post a article explaining much of it. Some of the systems don't even seem to work. I got my love meter up and I got an achievement for being revived and was supposed to get revived but I never did. There are no checkpoints only saves, which I never saw. If you die the entire game is over, at least thats what happened to me 3 times in the game. Cutscenes aren't skippable. The attacking looks weird, and the special attack didnt seem to work. Basically none of the game seems right. Music is actually nice though. Glad I got it in a bundle.

With the animations seeming to have missing frames and lack of good indicators, you're never sure how well you're doing against an enemy until it dies. Everything is so terrible in this department, it feels so sluggish you'd think the inputs were delayed and lagging.\n\nWhen it comes to sound, the only noticeable thing is the terrible voice acting with dialogue that can't be skipped so you're forced to listen to the stale, emotionless characters that don't even seem to try to get you to care about what's going on. Bad voice acting exists in a lot of things, yes, but when there are no means to skip or speed up the dialogue, it draws extra attention itself and it just seems to get worse each time it happens.\n\nIf the controls weren't so rubbish, I might have given game more time, but the terrible voice-acting that I couldn't skip really put me off. There's quite a bit of dialogue in the beginning which I'd have to repeat each time I died because of not having a clear indication of whether or not the enemy I fought was near death. It's annoying how terrible it is.\n\nDon't even take a chance on this one.

I'll be honest, I actually green-lighted this game personally on Steam.\n\nThe art style personally I couldn't really care too much for- it reminds me too much of those fairy stickers from Hot Topic but it looked well executed in the screenshots.  The story first impression seemed like "Ok, two characters- love...drama...bonding...possible use of double players in the moves." which by far isn't the most original thing out there.  But hey who does anything original anymore right?\n\nDespite that it wasn't stylistically my cup of tea- I love platform/rpgish/whatevergameswithsomekindahotchickonit that this thing was seeming to market itself as... before I played it and confirmed what a lot of reviews already said.\n\nTHIS GAME IS A HOT STEAMING MESS\n\nFirst off, great backgrounds and yes while I'm not totally into the art direction I like to give credit where credit is due.  Beautiful.  I can even accept the simplifi-wait why are the sprites so copy and their animations are completely inconsistent?  Why does my lil dude just seem like he pauses forever when he's attacking...\n\nThis game is bugged, unbalanced, the sprites are more or less seemingly rushed- it's like nothing was ever playtested.  Ever.  Did anyone of the Dev Team bother to even play this game?  Better yet did anyone outside of the Dev Team bother to play this game to let them know that some major game design sins are being committed here?\n\nWHY DOES SOMETHING IN THE FIRST LEVEL TAKE 15+ HITS TO KILL? No this isn't even about "Difficulty" This is just downright negligence... there isn't any skill to fighting these things it's just walk next to them and...look frozen and stuck while this slug thing looks like it might be taking damage.\n\nYou have a partner from the beginning with the BEST dialogue that sounds as lifeless as some of those chat programs (hey I could go into detail about the voice acting, but I can't knock it for trying - voice acting is tough, I've personally failed out of a voice acting audition before for a cartoon because I wasn't British enough) and while she's cool in her own way I guess... she just kinda scurry around and gets in the way.  Heck even if all she did was just Mirror your movement that would be an improvement.  The partner system is more or less unpredictable and unreliable if you want them to do anything beyond rushing forward and taking damage when it's not necessary or just idling away while some monster has their way with you.\n\nI don't understand some of the Interface, it's not anywhere near obvious or helpful whatever half of these meters are.  There is two sets and I'm sure one is my partners health? Maybe? Oh geez they have health great now I can look forward to them being useless and dying with the exception of them remembering to heal or rez me from time to time.\n\nBOTTOM LINE -\n\nBottom line, these are just a couple examples of just how broken this game actually is.  I would have just been happy if it was just a mediocre game at this point.  No wonder why many people can't get past the first level- it's not actually fun in any way shape or form and if this mirrors what the rest of the game is like...who would want to put up with it?\n\nDev Team, or Person(s) - You owe it to supporters to at least try to overhaul this game.  You got the game completed as far as I can tell, hell even just tweaking the numbers of enemies and items will be a MASSIVE step up for this game.  Animation Hold Times do not need to be as long as they are.\n\nThere is a gem in here waiting to happen.","January 5, 2015","false","0.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Really weird plot going across with strange gameplay makes this game "could be black horse", but all of magic i saw at begging of game was ruined by half-naked statues, near naked Dez, strange and unreadable GUI and first bug i saw on those giant bugs (bugception) which maked Dez starting to do really scary things like changing directions 1 million times in second. I played it for whole 15 minutes and I got massacred by weird tree/monster thing and I saw the game over screen and I was like. What the actual ♥♥♥♥. If you have this game, die and try to not make weird faces, if not, search on Steam Community screenshots or google for it. Really who drew that ♥♥♥♥ was really high. Altough the one really nice thing was soundtrack which is biggest plus in whole game. But gameplay, level project, plot is tottaly screwd up. Totally not recommended game.","June 22, 2015","false","2.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

''save alot''\n\n^w^\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=344604285 slight warning to achivement hunters, majority achivements are easily gained. some others may take a bit more time, but still gainable.\n\noh, and if having any trouble try hit and run tactics ^w^\n\n\n\nif this review is not helpful, please leave a comment as to why u feel that way so i may make changes if needed ^w^","July 14, 2015","true","3.3"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","11","26","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heikkito/recommended/331400/","heikkito","Nax_o","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heikkito/","1467 products in account","This game is a adventure-platformer hybrid built around an artistic vision on how the game should look- and it does have a certain look and feel not seen much.\n\nDont know if the story is good. First 30 minutes there is a lot of talk and glimpses into background lore - all told in a very rambling way but i have hopes things will clear up.\n\nSo if you are looking for a tightly polished platformer game then keep looking and skip this. Adventure game fans will not like this one either. First level is a mess and quite hard.  Nothing is explained and a dogged determination is required to advance. Only played 30+ minutes and advancement is quite slow yet the UI is not as bad as i feared from the greenlight discussions. 360 controller works great as long as you dont touch the LT/RT buttons which for some reason is windowed/full screen button.\n\nGame does have a certain appeal.  nothing is explained and so you have to learn things the hard way.\n\nedit: completed the game. It was good but the before mentioned caveats are still there.Storywise episode I does not give any kind of conclusions. It is a pretty decent game that gets better as you learn the ropes. I will be looking forward to Episode II.\n\nedit2: dev released a guide to the game. It is pretty much essential to take a look at it","November 24, 2014","true","5.3"," 26 of 85 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","26","85","2","1"
