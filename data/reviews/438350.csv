"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rawr365/recommended/438350/","Rawr365","Dj =D","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rawr365/","463 products in account","A great little puzzle game. There are 25 levels in total, which start off simple, but the difficulty begins to ramp up fairly quickly as you get going. The only criticisms I have is that there aren't really any error checking facilities right now (highlighting when you've put multiple numbers in the same net would help. Checking for errors was annoying on large puzzles) And a way to mark squares would really be nice as well, as in large puzzles it's difficult at times to remember which blank squares are linked to which others. Also bear in mind that there aren't any achievements or Steam Cloud support, so once you beat the game you won't really get anything to show you did, if you mind about that.\nThere isn't really much else to say, it's a small game, but it has a price to match. If you like puzzle games at all, then this is a must buy for such a low price.","March 15","true","1.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The lack of a windowed mode or the ability to go back to previous levels is annoying, but it's still well worth the price for an hour of gameplay.","March 16","true","1.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are only 25 levels, but the difficulty spikes up quickly. It's challenging at times, but so satisfying to complete a puzzle.

Ever since i was young i loved to play the game blokus or something like that this game gave me the nostalgia. I love how this game makes you create a 3D image in your head and it gets really addicting and so satisfying when you complete a level. Thats the most rewarding ding sound lmao. A very fun and creative puzzle game. Would love to see more levels if i even get that far though. :)","March 15","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/recommended/438350/","pogobeta","Pogo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/","467 products in account","It's sort of like the logic of sudoku, but instead of playing on a square grid, you play on a collection of overlapping unfolded dice (and filling in digits 1-6 instead of 1-9).\n\nYou can fill in the squares either by clicking repeatedly to cycle through digits or by typing the number on the keyboard.\n\nYou rely less on process of elimination and more on the knowledge that opposing faces of a six-sided die always add up to 7. You may find yourself imagining the cubes in 3D space, or you might learn how the opposing faces are distributed across the various possible flattened nets.\n\nTechnical suggestion: While it's great that you can type the digit you want when the cursor is hovering over the square, it would be nice if the player could navigate the board with WASD or arrow keys. I'm not bad at 10key, but trying to 10key left-handed while my right moves the mouse is quite awkward. I ended up playing the majority of the game by clicking.\n\nColorblind folks might have a tougher time with this one. Because so many of the die nets overlap in so many places, they're marked with little color tags. Unfortunately, some of the more complicated levels have so many nets involved that some of the colors look a bit similar. In these cases, the similar colors are usually kept fairly far apart to avoid confusion, but some of the later-game twists also affect spatial relationships and you might find yourself double- or triple-checking to make sure you aren't connecting the wrong colors.\n\nIt would also be nice to get some music added in. It wouldn't need much for how short it is. 1 or 2 ambient-sounding tracks would be really appropriate and welcome for this type of puzzle game. The existing background hum is better than nothing, but it gets a little unsettling and it's kind of ominous.\n\nI hope that additional levels are added as DLC, I'd love to play more of this.\n\ndice/10","April 25","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to put the numbers 1-6 in squares so they form valid dice. It doesn't get much harder later on, but the levels are bigger and twisted a bit so it takes longer to solve.","May 2","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
