Now, anyone who's in any way, shape or form a thinking entity knows that games are a bit of a subjective thing, and sometimes you just dig something, and other times you just don't.  I really, really dug the aforementioned games - just check out my playing hours on each if you need proof - but I just couldn't get into this one, I'm afraid.\n\nIt's kinda complicated, kinda confusing, but more importantly than that - 'cause both of those things can be overcome, with time and patience - it's actually kinda BLAND.  Never mind the dynamic-looking trailer.  Sure, the graphics are generally nice enough, but on the whole the gameplay still feels a tad "clunky", the story and associated artwork in the cut scenes is "clunkier" still, and the voice acting is...well, actually, the voice acting itself isn't that bad, but the quality of the voice RECORDING (please tell me that was a cheap USB mike you used) does nothing to dilute the faintly "amateurish" nature of the whole endeavour.\n\nNow, none of this is to say that there isn't potential here, and I'll certainly give the game points for ambition and originality.  But it all just left me feeling underawed and unenthused about delving any further than the fourth level.  Is it a "bad" game?  No, not as far as I can tell.  Some of you may even love it.  I didn't, and gave it nearly an hour of my precious life, and for now I'm putting the board back in its box and looking for other virtual "dice" to throw.  In all fairness to the devs, I'm yet to try multiplayer, but in all fairness to myself, I rarely enjoy multiplayer anyway, and it's hardly the sort of game you could "jump into" with friends without each of you tutoring yourselves in the basics first, anyway.  I actually feel faintly bad about giving this a thumbs-down - it's a borderline "fail" at worst, in my book - but I can't in all good conscience go thumbing up things which lost my interest in just a little over thirty minutes, can I now?  Maybe I'll return to it one day, maybe I won't.\n\nOne thing I'm confident in opining:  The twenty dollar price-tag is certainly a tad ludicrous.  If there IS an audience out there for this game, it's hardly liable to find it when such an "indie" game is being sold at such a non-"indie" price.  My advice to anyone who thinks they still might be interested:  Watch some walkthroughs, wait for the price to drop a little, and nab it in a sale.  Then you won't have wasted TOO much moolah if you find it isn't to your liking.  As it stands, a definite gamble...\n\nVerdict: 4.5/10.","November 27, 2015","false","1.0"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","32","42","2","0"

You can play it like Dungeons and Dragons and play in a tavern on a table near a crackling fire place while you play against your oponents. But you may also immerse yourself into the game and have it come to life around you as you and your allys navigate the horror filled dungeon to escape with your lives. This game is filled with excitement and unexpected surprises at every turn. There is a single player story mode with atleast 30+ hours of gameplay, and multiplayer with up to 9 players.\n\nSingle PlayerThis game has a long story mode with up to 30 hours of mind baffling gameplay, there are lots of levels of gameplay to keep you busy for quite a while. The single player is very unique and unlike any kind of dice game I have ever played, there are hundreds of ways to solve each and every level, and as you progress through the game each level will become more challenging and longer to complete. There are multiple characters you can control and different abilities to guide you through the dungeon. Fight your way to the exit through different enemy heroes and skeletons and more. You can choose your preffered playing style from a tavern board game to an always changing, living dungeon. This game is sure to make you think outside the box to solve complicated problems with just a set of dice.\n\nMultiplayerI have not personally played the multiplayer section of this game because there is no online multiplayer at the time and only locally. You can play with up to 9 different friends and either play on 9 different computers or take turns on one. You have the choice of playing as a hero or the undead, dungeon creatures. Drop in or out at anytime during the game without having to restart the whole level. Even take breaks with a new A.I mode and let the A.I control your character briefly while you are afk. I can't wait to try out this heart wrenching multiplayer and go face to face in this dungeon dwelving chaos.\n\nPros 30+ Hours of single player.\nMultiplayer with up to 9 players.\nConstantly changing dungeon.\nLots of heroes.\nGreat animations.\nActive and kind developers.\nIntresting plot line.\nCool background animations.\n\nCons Bugs\nNo Co-op (yet)\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

I also liked the god-dungeon as explanation for why this place exists and why people go into it.\n\nUnfortunately there are some problems. Seeing enemy turns is nice because you get to see in detail what the enemy is doing, but it's also time consuming. Which isn't so bad except that any time you fail you have to restart the level. Which wouldn't be so bad except I found myself frequently dumped in situations that were guaranteed failure - stuck on a spot needing 1 type of die (singular of dice) to get out, and even burning all my rerolls and checking my cards couldn't get me that escape.\n\nPerhaps I wasn't properly thinking ahead, or there is a key element I was missing - I did only get to level 7 - but with the DM's wide variety of actions (including changing the shape of rooms, rotating rooms, spawning full-room-death hazards, etc) plus extra enemy actors thrown into the mix, it just felt like "unfair" deaths were all too common, and the penalty too great (having to start over completely and wait through all those enemy turns over again). It felt like I spent more time waiting than playing, and that's never a good thing.\n\nI'm sad that I can't recommend this game, because it has several clever and fun concepts/mechanics. But the overall unfair deaths + tedious time consusming nature of restarting a level combine to make it a game I'm glad I tried but I won't be playing further.","December 4, 2015","false","5.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","5"

The UI and especially camera controls need work.  All the popups that interrupt the game and reset the map view you have to click through need to go.  Having to click through a confirmation to end turn when you have no moves left is stupid.  Having to press roll when that's the only thing you can possibly do at the start of a turn is stupid.  The DM turns take too long.  I couldn't understand how to make the flip tile work except as a random event.  Seems like there should be strategy involved, but it doesn't tell you what the resulting flip is going to look like.","March 25","false","5.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

There seems to be no vsync option; All animations stop while you move the mouse which gives a very scrappy feel to everything. Interface graphics look bad: Nasty-looking hollow cubes spin round nasty looking icons to represent the dice; a 2D egg timer looks odd and out of place; the camera resets every time you get a turn so moving it to get a good view seems almost pointless; the camera moves on its own as you move near various things with the mouse which can be annoying/disconcerting.\n\nIf the graphics and interface were better it wouldn't be such a chore watching the computer take its move (after all this is a boardgame rather than a play-it-as-fast-as-you-like-roguelike), but it is.","March 25","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

The character designs are interesting, the environments look good, and I tihnk it's fun that you can either play the game as a group in a living dungeon, or as people playing a tabletop strategy game.\n\nHowever, as a strategy game, I found the game very quickly becoming very repetitive and even a little dull. Besides the, somewhat gimmicky, mechanic of the flipping and turning of the rooms, the game introduced not too many interesting mechanics, in my opinion.\n\nThe game describes itself as requiring wit and luck. The wit should make sense, because it is a strategy game, and luck makes sense too, because there are dice, right? Well... What I noticed, especially in the stages where your objective was not to escape, but to kill a certain character in one go, is that the dice were just perfect. Impossible odds? Yes indeed. The dice are scripted. Let me repeat that. The DICE are SCRIPTED. So instead of giving you a random situation in which you need to make the best of things, the developers have already decided what dice you will get and they are thinking of the perfect solution, which you need to recreate.\n\nTo return to the mechanic of flipping rooms, I have found no way, but this could just be me, to figure out, before flipping, what the walkway was going to look like, resulting in deaths that felt, frankly, like bs deaths, as if I was being punished for not being psychic.\n\nSomething else that rubbed me the wrong way was the audio. The prologue, narrated by Sajotir, was really good, and it drew me into the story, which sounded genuinely interesting. The other spoken diologue, however, seemed to be of very strange, phone-like quality.\n\nSome of the things listed above could be fixed and changed, which I think would make the game cleaner (like text no longer moving out of the GUI), but when it comes to mechanics, it did little to interest me, which is my opinion, in the end. And perhaps I was expecting something the game wasn't.","February 9","false","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","3"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of a neat little Strategy/Adventure game The Living Dungeon. The Living Dungeon was released on November 2, 2015 by Publisher/Developer Radiation Burn.\n\n(NOTE: This was a review from a game in my own Steam library, it was NOT provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xK4U29ZYL4I\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nGreat Turn-Based, Board Game style adventure. Solo is above average, Multiplayer is the real plus. Online Multiplayer would bump it up much higher. As is, 3/5. Worth roughly $15.\n\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nThe Living Dungeon is an interesting adventure/strategy game with some interesting mechanics. The gameplay plays out like a tabletop board game. You roll your dice (5 each turn) and take your actions according to the dice rolls and the current layout of the board (this is where the strategy comes in). The Solo campaign is actually good. The action is fun, the game is fairly easy to pick up. The graphics are solid as well. It should be noted, however, that the camera is an absolute nuisance in this game. It IS adujstable, which saves it entirely. It will still frustrate you by constantly resetting every round, though. The voice acting is even solid. I don't recall skipping any cut-scenes (unless I had seen them before). The best feature of this game is the Multiplayer. Unfortunately, it is also the feature that is holding this title back the most. THe only way to play with friends is, sadly, locally (see note below*). Now, do NOT let this deter you. With the Steam Machines, Steam Controller/Big Picture, etc all in full swing now, playing this in the living room at a party is actually pretty easy to do. Like a board game without the mess that is incredibly easy for most to pick up. But man...this game would be an absolute SMASH if it were to incorporate two things: Online Multiplayer & Steam Workshop. If it did that, the game would explode in popularity. I guarantee it.\n\nAs is, you're still left with a solid game with your $15+. 3/5 with potential to be higher with the aforementioned adjustment.\n\n\n(* From Steam Page:\n\n"IMPORTANT NOTE: This game is currently LOCAL MULTIPALYER ONLY , using a Hot Seat system. Networking will hopefully be added in a near future update but we do not want to mis-sell the game as there has been some confusion. We're sure most of you will love the game, but it is currently local multiplayer, and a 30hr single player story")\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","November 29, 2015","true","0.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","5"

While it is not going to be for everyone, I had fun with the game. I probably wouldn't play the game for long stretches of time but it would be the type of game that I would come back to for an hour or two every so often.\n\nThe one thing that makes The Living Dungeon unique is the ability to manipulate the dungeon itself. Being able to flip, rotate, and swap tiles adds a decent amount of strategy to the game. You can't beat killing your enemies by taking away the floor beneath them.\n\nThe Living Dungeon was made by a really small developer and at times it shows. The graphics, story, and voice acting at times could use some polish but are good enough not to be that distracting. The game also currently has a couple small bugs but nothing game breaking.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is that it currently doesn't support online multiplayer. You can play local multiplayer though. I hope the game adds online multiplayer though since the computer AI is decent but it sometimes does some stupid things that lead to it killing its own characters.\n\nIf you like these type of interactive dungeon crawl board games I think you should enjoy the Living Dungeon. If the idea of being able to manipulate the dungeon really interests you I think you should really like the game. If you are only somewhat interested in the concept though I would probably wait for a sale.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer but received no other compensation.\n\nRead My Full Review[www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","November 3, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I spent a few hours with this game and I wanted to share my first impressions.\n\nFirst off the great folks at RadiationBurn provided a review copy to The Hidden Levels and for that we thank them greatly.\n\nMy first impression of the game was that the dice rolls sort of "gave" you what you needed. I realized later that a poor roll might mean one of the characters not doing anything for that turn. It's a fun mechanic and dice rolling is always a good time. The mechanic that stuck me as most unique is that certain characters can turn and flip rooms, often using that strategy to keep a party member alive or kill a mob.\n\nThe theme is a mix of steampunk and classic RPG or fantasy. I found it to be enticing enough and once you start playing the game and artwork all flow. The cutscenes were odd, but are very short and not likely anything to be concerned with. The story itself seems relatively straight forward. You are in different situations and they explain each one with a small story and goal or quest. The puzzles or levels themselves are very well done.\n\nI can see going back to this game, and even playing with friends. This is an interesting game with mechanics that are fresh, in a cute and stylish package. I can undoubtedly suggest this game for any fan of board games, or puzzle and strategy games. If you like fantasy games this also fits that bill. This was a pleasant surprise and I'll be spending more time with it in the very near future.

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEW\nThe living dungeon is a board game come to life.  which means this is like playing a real physical board game with figures, dice, and cards, but on a computer.  and in that regards, it delivers the overall feeling of playing a board game, everything fron the animations, to visual style, to the mechanics feels fitting.  and above that there is an interesting story that involves a fairly larg set of charecters and spans a 24 levels long challenging story mode.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPros: gameplay relies on manipulating the dungeon as much as movement and combat, allowing you to use different characters abilities to help each other accomplish a goal (as well as screwing each other or other players).\nvisual style, characters look like shiny board game figures, and the dungeon itself looks like board game tiles (tavern view) or a big mechanical beast (dungeon style)\nsound design, not the music, i mean the sound effects running in the background almost all the time, tik tok tik tok, it adds to the tension of the gameplay itself, tik tok tik tok.\nwide array of charecters, each unique in both how they play (their affect on their dice rolls and its effects) and who they are (their personality and relation to other characters.\ngameplay is deep and rewards clever manuvers.\nstary mode, its long enough and challenging, even more so if you try to get all the bonus objectives.\nhotseat multiplayer, oddly enough, not all board games have that feature which is the heart of what makes a game like this fun and last long.\ntavern style & dungeon style; two different viewing styles for the dungeon, while they dont affect the gameplay, it changes the look, feeling, and mood.  tavern looks and feels like you are sitting at a table with friends playing a board game with carboard tiles and plastic figures and dice, while dungeon style is like what this dungeon looks and sounds liek in your head when playing. (switching between these styles is by far my favorite feature)\nsteampuk setting (love that stuff).Cons: the camera can be annoying at times.\nthe music, can't remember a single tone, all that remains when I turn off the game is the tik tok tik tok...\ntoturial doesn't explain some of the basic stuff (camera controls, some enemies can NOT be killed by a weapon, how to reroll, and some minor things).\nthe game relies on the luck factor a bit too heavily; if the dice screw you after a reroll, chances are you are dead.\nno online multiplayer as of yet (devs said they are looking into it).\nin story mode, no clear indication of wither you have completed the bonus objective or not (especially troublsome when it include turn count) and no ways of looking at previous stages to see which ones you havn't completed the bonus objective.\n═══════════════════════════════════\nGAMEPLAY FOOTAGE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSOfm6ROa5k\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nscore: 7.5/10\n\nIf you like board games, if you like playing with your friends while sitting on a couch (and propably lose a few freindships), if you like a good challenge with a decent story then you might like this game.","November 28, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

TLDR I recommend getting it when it goes on sale.\n\nOk so there is a lot to like here, mostly in terms of story and art direction.  The lizardman, Sajotir is an epic badass and characters like Meru are silly in an endearing, amusing way.    The art direction and character design is cool and unique and it's well written.  Unfortunately, it is saddled with such a threadbare game system that it just made me wish that these characters and this world was in a proper RPG.  Like, this entire setup just freaking begs for a sick dungeon crawler and this is all I could think of while muddling through the game.  And yes, I know this is a personal preference.\n\nBut as it stands the system is...well, kinda janky?  I'm not sure how to place it but it feels like a the first draft of a board game which ends up being a bizarre mixture of randomness and static which I can't quite make sense of.\n\nAlso,  I'm willing to forgive a lot in terms of graphics and physical presentation, but everything about the delivery is amaeturish.  The actual voice acting is fine, but it seems to be low fidelity... like it was recorded on inexpensive hardware or encoded improperly.  The animations are distractingly bad, especially when compared to the detailed 3d character models and it takes me out of the game.  This is 2015 and you are asking 25 dollars for this game!!  That kind of lack of quality in the implimentation does not cut it!  If you didn't think you could pull off a full on 3D implimentation gracefully you should have gone 2D.  There is nothing wrong with sprites or pixels, what we care about is that it's done in a quality way.  A poorly done 3D game looks worse than a well done 2D one.  Remember that.\n\nBottom line is that I think that these devs should keep on doing what they are doing.  They clearly have good ideas and I think with some more practice they will be able to impliment them.  Hell, the art and presentation of the game was enough to make me pick it up!   I'd recommend getting this game if it ever goes on sale for less than 10 dollars, (I think a 6.99 price point is about where I'd be most comfortable and not feel like anybody is being screwed).\n","November 9, 2015","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeypolicego/recommended/362290/","monkeypolicego","Monkeypolicego","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeypolicego/","21 products in account","The Living Dungeon is a really impressive debut title from indie developers Radiation Burn. It uses the core elements of table-top gaming by being turn based, reliant on the outcome of a set of 6-sided dice, and has scenery you can flip or rotate in order to escape a dungeon or kill an enemy.\n\nI was really impressed with how easy the game was to learn, and for someone like me who hasn’t played a tabletop game since the days of Hero Quest back in the 90s it felt slightly nostalgic. The first few dungeons guide you through the mechanics of the game with a tutorial on abilities and combat. I liked the atmosphere of the ‘tavern’ backdrop for the game, as it felt good to play on a wooden table with the warm glow of a fire in the background.\n\n\nLiving Dungeon Inn\n\nThe passion Radiation Burn has for the genre really shows through. The Living Dungeon begins with scene setting narrative and introduces you to Chantelle – a female warrior whom is the first character you control. You’re literally dropped into a tutorial dungeon where the dice, movement and combat are explained. You take turns with the AI to move your character through a basic dungeon layout and are shown the capabilities of some of the enemy types.\n\nInitially, you’re able to one-shot enemies so it’s fairly easy to play through the first few levels. The difficulty curve only becomes apparent there when you’re introduced to new characters, and learn the skills they bring. I found it quite easy to get into the flow of the game and it was only the slightly odd camera angle that distracted me from the game. I found I was constantly adjusting the camera to get a better view of the board as the AI resets the view back to the default setting at the end of your turn. That was really the only thing that irked me and I soon got back into the pace of the game and happily made it through many levels with only very minor mishaps.\n\nLiving Dungeon screenie\n\nThe game is very forgiving of mistakes and resets the level if anything goes wrong, such as knocking your character off the board with an ill-placed tile flip or attacking a friendly character instead of an enemy. As all enemies are killed with a single strike it was unfortunate that the game lets you select any characters on the board to attack rather than narrowing your options down to just being able to attack the enemies.\n\nOverall I found the game really charming. It has a very indie-feel to it with the hand drawn illustrations and the voice actors who never seemed too concerned that they were trapped in a dungeon, fighting for their lives. But for me this really captured the essence of a table-top game, where one of your friends plays the part of GM and reads part of the story to you. The Living Dungeon is a great debut from Radiation Burn and they’re definitely a studio worth keeping an eye on.","November 10, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As a beginner it's a little hard to grasp at first but once you're accustomed to how the game works figuring out how to complete each level brings an immense sense of satisfaction.\n\nThe multiplayer is 9 local players which involves lots of mind-games trying to psyche out your friends and turn them against eachother while you secretly go for the win.","February 28","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a lengthy single player campaign if you are into turn based puzzle type games similar to Hitman Go or Lara Croft Go on mobile. But when you have finished that, or if you want more "bite sized" portions of play, you can play the multiplayer mode. Of course it's not online yet, but it is perfect to play against others locally or against the AI which still makes for some fun and tense sessions. If the game at all seems intriguing from the screens and trailer, you will most likely love playing it. I knew I wanted it when I first laid eyes on their web page over a year ago, and now that I have actually played it, I am not disappointed! This is one of the most fun and unique computer games you will ever play.","November 2, 2015","true","6.7"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

Which means: If I end my turn without getting out of the corner or killing them, I'll die.\nWell, I have 5 dice, so no problem. I roll my dice and... I get 2 swords, I kill them, but I can't move towards the goal. So I end my turn and another enemy spawns beside me. No problem, I can just move away. So I roll my dice again and I get... neither a foot nor a sword. I can rotate the f*cking room 5 times, but that doesn't help me get rid of the enemy, so I die. Which means: I have to restart the whole level.\n\nThat happened three times to me, but then I finally did it. Funnily I didn't even have to get this girl out, I could make her run in circles and let the other one run to the goal. Which is easier because she has different dice. Each character has a different set of dice (combat dice, movement dice, mechanical dice) and as you can see either the game is really unbalanced or the A.I. is really smart because it spawns the enemies near the girl who can only turn rooms.\n\nThe game became more fun afterwards. Until I got into level 7 which introduced shadow tiles. It was pretty exciting because I had to survive for 5 rounds and that was harder than it sounds, but it enjoyed it because I had to good set of dice. Well, I enjoyed it until the A.I. got stuck. I finished my round and a message popped up saying "The A.I. is thinking..." - as usual when it's the A.I.'s round. After about 5 minutes of thinking I finally quit the game and uninstalled it. According to the Steam forums I'm not the only one experiencing this problem.\n\nSo, if you want an interesting game which involves lots of luck and bugs which keep you restarting levels over and over again, you're at the right place.","March 30","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
