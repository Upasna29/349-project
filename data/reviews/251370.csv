After playing Escape Goat, I am not here to review a simple 2D puzzle platforming game. I am here to prove that this goat is a witch. Goats have long been known for their platforming prowess. They have always been able to scale tall mountains with ease. Like all goats, this one can dash forward to ram through breakable walls or extend a jump. Those are qualities that a normal goat possesses. This goat can double jump. There is no other goat that can jump in mid air.\n\nThe meager purple goat that you see before you has broken out of our deepest, darkest prison within only three hours. All with the aide of a cohort mouse that believe it or not, this goat talks to! Not only that, but the goat can command this mouse. The goat can send the mouse running in a straight line, scaling up walls, traversing ceilings and hitting switches. It can even get placed under a sleep spell where it rests wherever this foul witch goat places it! Making it useful to rest on 'weighted switches' that need a body to hold them down. This heathenish goat can even toss its unwilling partner in escape upward where it can then cling on the ceiling and walk forward. The mouse can be instantly summoned back by the simple will of the goat.\n\nI would like to show the court evidence A. The magical hat I have just revealed allows the witch goat to change places with the mouse. Calling this hat magical is a farce! It isn't the hat that is magic, its the goat that makes the hat magic! The goat was able to have the mouse crawl through small areas and then teleport directly to them.\n\nThere were still things that the goat couldn't possibly use his mouse ally for. Wall mounted switches that only the goat could touch. These switches lead to a variety of things. Both bad that enabled platforms to help the goat escape and good that started machine like traps. Walls that moved, floors that shifted. All the goat had to do was exit out of each room's open door. If the door wasn't open, the goat managed to find keys that it used to unlock the door. Sometimes six keys in one room and this goat managed to collect them all!\n\nBecause of these talents, this magical goat may have escaped all 55+ rooms in this prison, but it cannot escape the arm of the law! This goat managed to escape its own cell block of five puzzling rooms. Then it made its way to the gathering place where it opened up new cell blocks. For every cell block the goat went through, it opened up two more cell blocks. It was able to go through each of the nine cell blocks consisting of five rooms each. All to rescue its sheep sisters from prison. After all that, the witch goat managed to escape nine final rooms of doom!\n\nEach cell block is themed and had even more danger, but the goat make it look easy and fun! One cell block of five rooms featured ice blocks. Blocks too cold for its mouse friend. Blocks that the goat managed to ram and push. Another cell block had hollow blocks that the goat could travel through, but other blocks stacked on top of. Razorblades spinning around platforms couldn't stop the goat! Nor could death reapers that throw fireballs when they spot the goat. Nor could fire breathing wall mounted sentries!\n\nMoving platforms, mechanized blocks, changing structures, rolling barrels that explode when lit on fire and walls that blew up when lit on fire. Nothing could stop this goat! How on this great Earth could one goat survive death like that? Well truth is, the goat never survived death. This goat is as fragile as your ordinary goat. Anything can kill it. Its magic that brought this goat back to life again and again! If the goat ever got trapped in a room. It could suicide, completely resetting the room. The rare times that the goat would fall into pits or be able to leave the room without exiting through the door, the goat respawned!\n\nAfter all this, the goat thinks it can make a better prison. It can somehow make blue prints and escape from a prison of its own invention! Well witch goat, you may have escaped from the easy prison, but after you made your 3 hour escape look easy, there is another prison waiting for you more brutal than the first! The additional prison has 28 more rooms in 4 cell blocks. All without having to spend more taxpayer money.\n\nI feel that I have proven my point your honor. We cannot have this goat walking among us in civilized society. May the good people of Steam find this goat guilty of being a witch and sentence it to prison!","December 19, 2014","true","3.6"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","87","33","38","10","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/251370/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","I like to think of Escape Goat as "the little game that could". Launching first on the highly flawed and crowed Xbox Indie Game Market, it garnered a cult following that pushed it ahead of the seemingly endless shovelware that littered the platform, eventually making its way to Steam and even getting a sequel. Despite the acclaim, I've been sitting on the sidelines, still unconvinced by the unimpressive graphics and seemingly basic design. As is often the case though, my first impressions couldn't have been further from the truth, as Escape Goat more than lives up to its well deserved reputation.\n\nLocked in a dungeon, you play as a magical goat with a magical mouse friend, on a journey to escape and bring with you the magical sheep who have been trapped for an eternity for crimes of witchcraft. To get to these sheep however you must first solve a series of puzzle rooms, the contents of which can be anything from harmless blocks to fire casting Reapers. Because of its nonlinear structure, there isn't any way for your abilities to grow overtime or otherwise have the game expand and evolve the further you get, but far from being a handicap the developer uses this potential limitation to craft remarkably consistent levels. There's no gradual rise in difficulty or sharp spikes later on, but instead a constant stream of challenging but not frustrating level designs that feel incredibly satisfying to complete.\n\nYou may only have less than a handful of moves and abilities, but the ways these can be applied to levels continues to broaden as different areas showcase various applications of them that never would have occurred to me to even try. It's this continual progression of what you think you can do without actually changing anything about your character that makes Escape Goat such a clever game to play. It rewards your own ingenuity without resorting to simply giving you a new mechanic to work with.\n\nIf you have yet to partake in the escape of Argus with your magical mouse friend, I'd advise you to delay no longer. Developer Magical Time Bean's Escape Goat is a truly impressive achievement and a joyous game to play, who's biggest flaw is it ends so soon (though perhaps it's for the best, as it completely negates the chance for filler). Despite its dated look it manages to feel fresh and innovative the whole way through, and you'd be fool to do as I did and wait so long to give it a chance.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 26, 2014","true","2.3"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","2"

Everything about it makes me happy: the look, the sound, the music, the title and characters and tone of writing, the way the controls feel, and of course the puzzles that deliver your satisfying "a-ha!" moments.\n\nHowever, most of all what I love about it is the mechanical movement of all the room elements.  You see, most of what you actually do in Escape Goat is trigger switches, wary of their consequences, which typically involve all manner of blocks and platforms and electric arcs and explosives changing positions in ways that are necessary for completing the room but will also kill you if you haven't planned things out properly.\n\nWhat I find so wonderful is that all of these things that change do so along tracks and pulleys and cogs that animate throughout the background.  Blocks do not merely shift into new positions but rather travel to them believably and in concert with other moving pieces.  This is hardly necessary to the gameplay, but it creates an aesthetic experience that transports me behind the eyes of a child seeing a trip passage in a fireplace or a hidden compartment under a stair for the first time—every time.  I sometimes find myself triggering switches without cause, only to study the resulting machinations.  It just sparks my imagination, one of those uncategorizable details of videogames that make them a delight uniquely to you.\n\nWill you agree with my feelings?  I have no idea, but it's worth a try, wouldn't you say?","December 4, 2013","true","2.3"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","0"

The graphics and sound are a fitting, pretty standard retro style, and the game mechanics are well-designed.\n\nThough it’s probably best characterized as a puzzle platformer, I found Escape Goat’s puzzling aspects to be pretty tame. In all but the last group of rooms, each puzzle tended to have a pretty obvious/straightforward solution. Let’s just say that if we were to build a difficulty scale for these types of games, Fire N’ Ice might be near the top, while this game would come close to defining the bottom end. Of course, it’s still a fun game, so I won’t concern myself too much with that.\n\nVerdict: It’s worth playing, but I probably won’t go back for the speedrun achievement (I hate speedruns in puzzle games), nor do I feel compelled to do the extra challenge levels that unlocked after the end of the game.","August 24, 2014","true","3.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/251370/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","I first played Escape Goat on XBLI and instantly fell in love. It's a cute, but challenging puzzle platformer about a purple goat and a mouse with a sweet pimp magic hat who must escape from some jerk's diabolical prison. To do this, they must travel through nine different areas to rescue the magical, slumbering sheep within, and then conquer one final extra-long area for good measure.\n\nEscape Goat has an interesting way about its levels. They're always shifting. Buttons and switches move blocks, barrels will roll, platforms move along tracks, and crates explode (usually in big chain reactions). Puzzles tend to involve trying to understand what will make what do what, and then making sure it all happens in the right order without getting yourself killed.\n\nThe actual movement can be a little floaty, but you quickly get used to it. It's not a game-ruiner. Block-wide openings require some precision to get through that may cause a few deaths when you're in a hurry or just unlucky with your dash timing. Still not a game-ruiner, but occasionally annoying.\n\nThere are enemies, but you can't kill them directly. You can often kill them indirectly, by using the environment creatively. In several spots, this can even gain you achievements. Which, by the way, aren't just your standard "congrats you beat another level!" fare. The majority of the achievements here are for completing levels in challenging ways. Many of these require you to do things that were clearly not intended when the game was originally released on XBLI, but which probably came to the dev's attention later on down the line. Barring a handful of annoying chievos, these add a good deal to the game, requiring you to think outside the box and push your skills to the limit.\n\nOn that note, the overall difficulty of the game is pretty good. You've got a few easy warm-up levels, and then quickly get into the thick of it. Towards the end, you'll be putting your platforming skills to the test. If it's still not tough enough for you, don't fret. Once you complete the game, a bonus mode unlocks with four worlds of extra-challenging levels. A warning pops up to tell you that the going's going to get tough when you start it. And it's not kidding. I'm sure not finishing that without a walkthrough anytime soon.\n\nThe game looks great! The dev understands the importance of color, something which pleases me greatly. There's a bit in the first Castlevania episode of Sequelitis about using colors that pop, and it's a lesson that I feel doesn't get taken to heart often enough. In Escape Goat, your goat is purple. Your mouse friend is orange. The environments use a variety of colors to keep your eyes focused. No slog through brownish grey ruins, here. I mean, there... there are some browns and greys. But you get what I'm saying.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but I think the music here shines above all else. Which is only natural, as the dev was originally a video game composer before getting into design, as well. There's a unique sound to the music of Escape Goat that I really can't describe very well. They should have sent a musician. I don't know if it's an echoey sound or, I dunno. Reverb? Something. Makes for some mysterious melodies, though, I can tell you that. Give it a listen on Bandcamp[magicaltimebean.bandcamp.com], if you like. If that sounds like something you'd like to hear in a game, then this is that game, and you know where the purchase button is!\n\nThe game contains a level creator, and you can play player-made levels by placing them into a certain folder on your computer. There's a stickied thread on EG's Discussions board that will tell you more.\n\nIt's pretty short at about 3 hours for the initial campaign, with potential time extensions in the forms of the bonus campaign and player-made levels. It's also pretty cheap at only $5, which seems like a pretty good trade off. I can safely recommend the game at that price. If you're on the fence, $1.24 during a sale is honestly about as much of a steal as a steal can be. If you're dissatisfied at that price (you won't be), then I just don't know what you're doing with your life.","January 16, 2015","true","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

[KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]\n\nI was not really expecting much from this game and instead I found a little gem! Do not let you scare by the ancient graphic, the character (a goat!) is controlled with pixel precision, the animations are smooth and the game doesn't really need any improvements: it works and looks great as it is.\n\nThe aim of the game is to find the exit of the level and then the exit of the entire evil dungeon! Every room provides you a different hindrance and so you will have to prove your skills in platforming, puzzle solving and timing! A friendly rat and some kind sheeps will enlight your way... The difficulty is average, letting you progress nicely in the game, but then skyrocketing on the very last levels, forcing you to make more than one rage quit!\n\nThe translation surprised me, too. Not that there is a lot of text, but it is fine-tuned and funny to read!\nThe only bad point is about the longevity: lower than average (3 to 4 hours depending on your skills), but I enjoyed every minute out of it!\n\nBest played with X360 Joypad\nRecommended Buy Price < 6$\nScore 8/10","February 21, 2014","true","2.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

At such a low price, I'm OK recommending it.  My only gripe is that there are far too many times when a mechanism's result is unclear.  Otherwise, the platforming is solid and the visual style is simple and fairly easy to recognize the parts after you have seen them once.  As with Super Meat Boy, I enjoy the single-room challenges that are fairly compact and let you get back to the action quickly, and it offers a variety of routes in case you get stuck on one area (this did not happen on the first mission).\n\nThe first mission was fairly easy - the second, so far - painfully hard.  There are some annoying frustrations in it that I could do without.  while most are more thoughtful, there is one that required some painful split second pixel-perfect moves, and it feels out of place.  At least it is the first thing you do in that level, and so once you get past it the rest is less obnoxious.\n\nLast thing I want to say.  The story is weird because it would be perfect if they had just said "You are a goat - escape and rescue some sheep", but it decides that it wants to try and throw some ambiguity into it that either needed to be expanded more or forgotten.  I clearly put far too much effort into thinking about this as you can safely ignore it and miss nothing, but because it is there I have to say something.","October 15, 2013","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of levels are beaten at an easy pace as you realize how this particular system works and what you have to do to escape it. The main quest is pretty short but gives you a lot of pleasure. But don't worry! If that's not enough for you then there's a huge, complicated bonus campaign, not to mention the level editor that allows the players to create their own worlds and share them between themselves (you can find fan-made maps on the developer's forum, and some of them are quite worthy of note).

You are a goat trying to escape each room by solving the puzzles.  All you can do is jump, head-butt things or get some help from a little mouse who is also trying to escape. It's similar to the original Lode Runner or Montezuma's Revenge (or more recently Spelunky). The graphics look old school but the gameplay is really well done and the music is a lot of fun. They've also made it really easy to start over if you mess up one of the puzzles.\n\nSince it was made for the XBox 360 it's got very good controller support but you could probably play it with the mouse and keyboard if you wanted.

Few puzzles rely on sheer timing, although many utilise automation as a timer or to flow you along. Certain elements of this can be confusing to begin with as its never especially clear what is going to affect what so it can be a little disheartening to need to learn through failure constantly.\n\nI dont consider myself any sort of don regarding puzzle games, however I felt Escape Goat was a touch short. Most early rooms feel little more than filler -- the gentle difficulty I mentioned before -- and it is not until the final area does the game really make you stop and consider your actions. I cant accurately gauge whether I felt enjoyment more from solving the puzzles or simply going through the motions in order to progress.\n\nThat said, the post-game is where anyone who enjoys cracking toughies may find the most enjoyment. They kick the difficulty up to eleven, throw you on your knees and tell you to get to work. Theres also a level editor should you wish to exact such punishment upon others yourself.\n\nAll this with charming graphics for under a fiver?

While that youre freeing some sheep and find a helping mouse as your partner. This game provides you a few hours of gameplay in several great levels. To meantion now is its only weakness, this game is kind of short. This is not unusual for indiegames, so its normal that you dont get 30+ hours of it by just using the regular levels, but for this the game has an editor to create your own levels.

The main storyline of the game has 65 levels grouped into 10 zones (9 sets of 6 rooms, and a set of 9 at the end), and once you complete it, you unlock ridiculously hard bonus levels with another 36 rooms (pushing the total to just over 100) I still haven't finished all of the bonus rooms (though I've managed to get through 27 of them, they're seriously evil) but you don't have to even touch them to complete all achievements, which is good for me, because I like having that 100% complete record.\n\nThe graphics are pretty generic 8-bit indie debut game, and the music, although catchy, is nothing to marvel at. Still they don't pull you out of the game or detract from the experience, and the low load on my computer is one of the reasons I am even able to play, so for those out there like me who don't have a proper gaming machine, those qualities are bonuses.\n\nOverall, it's a good game with a fun story, a lot of puns, and solid play. I think it's worth the $5 price tag, and with the sequel out (and pretty popular) this is sure to go on sale fairly often too. Pick it up if you can; it's worth it.","June 2, 2014","true","15.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The levels are well designed and with one notable exception any deaths you get in a level are from your own mistakes. Having said that, the controls need to be perfect in a game like this and unfourtunately are a little bit rough in this game. Thankfully its nothing too problematic. Another issue is the game's length. It is really short for the money payed and so I cannot recommend this except if there is a sale.

It's somewhat easy to get through the main campaign but even after you get through that there's so much more to play through. The mechanics are simple but the puzzles can get so complex. I've found myself just entering a level and just staring for minutes until I attempted to try to find a solution because the levels can be so mesmerising and so complicated that you have to really think about how to tackle them.","September 6, 2014","true","2.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game will entice you from the start with its nice pixel art graphics and a comfy musical background. And believe me, you will hear it many times. You are in a difficult situation of an escape goat who has to solve a logical puzzle and get to a wonderful gate, which indicates the end of a level. The levels are more challenging the more deep you go. You have to collect keys, use a spell or your friend the mouse.  The controls are kind of good and you will learn them quickly. You don’t even have to have a controller. After the first six levels you are introduced to a hub world, which is a gateway to other worlds, which there are nine in total. These consist of six levels also and they will pose a nice challenge. The amount of fun is equal to the amount of puzzles, which will test your skills. The worst part is the start of a new level, but on the other hand you will gain the momentum after a while. Some levels are more an action-packed platformer rather than a puzzle game, and because of that the game remains original. The pricing is adequate to the amount of gameplay.\n\nIt is my obligation to inform you that we have received a review copy of this game.","November 30, 2013","true","3.5"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","8","19","2","0"

The exact timing of the puzzles create a great platforming challenge, as the actual window you may have to reach your goals can be very short and very difficult. Then there's the mouse, an NPC that you can send out to run along walls/ceilings, hit switches for you, and get into small places, this creates scenarios where you also have to aim the mouse with precise timing to complete your goal.\n\nI really appreciate how there is no direct way to kill any of the enemies in this game, instead the focus is on dodging, sneaking, and distracting them. They're less enemies and more like elements of the puzzle that can hurt you, as many levels require baiting enemies to destroy blocks or hit switches. Then there's levels that basically amount to ridiculous rube-goldberg machines, and figuring out how they even work is half the fun and half the challenge.\n\nI bought this game for 2 bucks on sale, and it was worth evey penny.","August 1, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a puzzle-platformer with a retro aesthetic. Also, there really wasn't anything that really blew me away about the game. However, don't think that this game is bad because of that. It's actually a very solid game with excellent level design (with a few exceptions and another part that I'll talk about later). As far as the controls and mechanics go, this game keeps things rather simple. You are, as you might guess, a goat. You also have a mouse companion with you that you can use to distract the enemy (there's only one type of enemy, but that's okay; combat doesn't exist in this game) or send into narrow corridors to do various things. You can send out the mouse and call it back at any time, and there exists a power up in some levels that allows you to switch positions with the mouse.\n\nThe levels themselves do make a great deal of use of the mechanics and are very good about introducing concepts without tutorializing you to hell and back. While there are a few levels that don't feel like puzzles at all or are rather easily broken, I'd argue that about 90% of the levels are well thought out and cleverly designed. All in all, there's about 50 levels in the game, with the exception of the extra chapter that you probably shouldn't play.\n\nThis chapter is called All Intensive Purposes, and after one level I stopped playing it because of the immense bad taste just one level left in my mouth. That level was the first level of a chapter called Death Row, and it's pretty much an unfair piece of garbage. The problem comes from the fact that the event triggers for the level are invisible. Likewise, a lot of these triggers create unpredictable effects that can completely ruin your progress. Yes, there's even a pretty much unavoidable death trap at the end of the level that made me stop playing. There's a difference between difficult and unfair. Maybe there were better levels later on in the chapter, but after spending about 20 minutes trying to beat that level, only to be screwed over by an unavoidable death trap at the end. After how expertly crafted most of the main stages were, a level like that felt like an insult followed by a slap to the face.\n\nApart from that, though; the game itself is very fun and very enjoyable. It is a fairly short game, clocking in at just over two hours for the main stuff for me, but for quite a few very clever puzzles that actually feel rewarding to solve, $5 is a very good value. 8/10.\n\nStory: You am goat leave prison fast much. Yeah, no point rating it.\n\nGraphics: As mentioned earlier, this game goes for an 8-Bit aesthetic. The pixel art isn't exactly impressive, but it's not bad either. The animations are smooth, it's easy to differentiate between things, and it's pretty functional while not looking lazy or bland. For the technical aspects, the game launches with the option of fullscreen or windowed. The game fullscreened to my native resolution of 1080p without a hitch, so you probably shouldn't have many issues (if any at all). Overall, the graphics style isn't gonna blow anyone away, but the animations are good and the game works perfectly on a technical level. 3/5.\n\nSound: Pretty much just music to talk about here, and man oh man, does this game have a good soundtrack. Whoever Chainsaw is, ya did good. The only complaints I can make (and they're minor) is that the songs do get reused for a couple of sections and one of the songs loops weirdly. Other than that, this soundtrack is worth getting on its own merits. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 8/0/3/5; cumulative score of 8.0/10. Definitely a very solid game that is worth your time and $5.","July 18, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles often revolve around trying to find a way around strange machinery filled with buttons and switches, which fits pretty well and there is a lot of creative puzzle designs in place to the point where it is hard to explain it, you just have to see it for yourself. You also get a mouse companion who you can send out to climb walls to reach buttons you couldn't otherwise get to or to distract enemies, as well as teleport between characters in certain levels, which is a pretty fun mechanic.\n\nThe grapich and sound design is pretty charming, going for a retro style, but one that seems to be based on old PC games rather than NES games, which is a nice change of pace. The music is pretty catchy and cool, and the sound effects seem well done, though I wish the music would loop seemlessly instead of starting and stopping, like it is now it's a bit like listening to a song on loop on an MP3 player or something.\n\nThe controls are a bit stiff though, it's obviously made to be used with a controller, but my PS3 controller was not recognized with the game, I am unable to use a Xbox one and it is a PC game so I wish they had done a bit more to make it fun with a Keyboard, especially in the later levels which turns into a platform hell of borderline I Wanna Be That Guy proportions. The game is also a bit short, 2-3 hours to beat all levels, so be aware of that in case you wanna wait for a sale, though there is a level editor and some secrets to extend the playtime further thankfully.\n\nAll in all, if you have a Xbox controller and like puzzle platformers it's a pretty good game, just do be aware it's pretty frustrating sometimes if you play with a keyboard.","July 1, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fortunately 2 minutes into playing I found myself drawn into an extremely slick 2d puzzle platformer with a great soundtrack.  The basic mechanic of jumping around and hitting some switches is complimented by a little mouse friend to help extend your 'reach' a bit.\n\nLevels start out quite forving as they teach you the basic game mechanics and interactions with the mouse, but by the half way point start turning wuite fiendish and can require many, many, *many* attempts to get past.  By the end thye are sort of straddling that luck vs skill vs figuring out three way fight and sometimes you'll know what needs to be done, but it will take you dozens of lives before you manage to just slip between two death dealing traps in exactly the right way to continue.\n\nOn that note, one *warning* for people with more advanced gaming hardware.  It turns out that the timing of the game is not based on clocks/counters but rather on the frame pacing of the games draw engine.  For most people with 60hz displays, that won't matter much (though you can get a slight 'slowdown' if you set things to a 50hz euro sync rate instead).  Those of us with 144hz gaming panels though are in for a bit of a rough ride.\n\nI hit a certain level where i was just physically incapable of timing jumps fast enough to 'work' and thought I must have the wrong idea of what the level needed, so I looked up a youtube walkthrough. Well wouldn't you know it, everything seemed to be moving way *way* slower for that guy, and he was speaking german... I put two and two together, rebooted the game with the display at 50hz not 144hz, and suddnly everything was literally moving 3x slower and those 'impossible' jump timings suddenly became quite easy.\n\n(and to think i beat the first half of the game at 3x 144hz 'speed')\n\nThat resolved though I really did enjoy the game and would happily reccomend it to anyone who loves neo retro indie stuff with great soundtracks and great action puzzle platformer game play.","June 26, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dime a dozen, right? But look past that and what you have is a nearly flawless game. It never uses it's retro stylings as an excuse for bad design - like Doom, it feels like a game that not only lives up to modern standards but will have aged very well ten years from now.\n\nThe one-room level design is consistently clever and always uses it's different pieces in new and unexpected ways. The instant respawn means it's rarely frustrating, it's moderately challenging but easy to understand your many mistakes, and the controls are strong enough that 99% of your deaths are your fault.\n\nOn top of that, the soundtrack is catchy and memorable and even the sound design is very well done - the chime when you collect a key, for example, is so satisfying that I can hear it while I'm typing this. And although the graphics are simple, they'll grow on you as very charming in their own right - it looks so much better than most retro-styled games that the HD graphics in E♥♥♥♥lmost feel like a step down.\n\nIt's not perfect, of course. If you prefer games that last for dozens of hours, the basic game lasts only a few -  just long enough that it largely avoids getting gimmicky or repetitive. There are achievements, a set of obscenely brutal bonus levels, and custom level sets that can keep you playing for a long while, but none of them really live up to the original game.\n\nSome of the levels are also less clever than others, particularly some of those in The Endless Machine that fall into the trap of trial and error puzzle design. Others rely far too much on reflexes, which doesn't suit this game particularly well - although the controls work well, your goat isn't really built for twitch platforming.\n\nBut, really, those are minor problems. When the game is great, it makes you remember why you fell in love with the genre in the first place  - and it's that great for nearly every minute you spend with it. It wasn't a recent obsession of mine for nothing!","October 12, 2013","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzels work mostly by playing around breaking blocks, hitting switches, sending your mouse helper around, etc., until you figure out the right order to do it in to beat the room. It's about experimenting and discovery, and isn't frustrating. The platforming in the normal levels isn't anything hard. Something about being a goat head-butting into things makes it fun anyway.\n\nIf it looks fun from the video, it probably is fun for you. I say try it.\n\nThen there are the bonus levels. Now I enjoy these, but I spent an entire afternoon in them and only made 30% progress. I'll probably never beat them all. The platforming needs to be perfect, with perfect jumps and perfect timing. You'll die 20+ times figuring out just one jump, then 20+ times on the next, etc., until you figure out the level. Then add in another 100+ deaths since you'll just plain screw up plenty of times. Death is low-frustration because you respawn in 2 seconds, and the music keeps playing without resetting. The music is very catchy and keeps me motivated. But low-frustration over 200+ deaths starts to accumulate into real frustration. :p\n\nSo the bonus levels aren't for everyone. I don't regret trying them, since beating even a few is very satisfying. But ... I probably won't finish!","November 30, 2013","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike the main game, those levels overstay their welcome and require extremely precise control, beyond what I feel the game's engine really allows -- Try dashing into a one-block spot and you'll hit the wall by a pixel or two every other time.

You come up with a clever pun - "Hmmm... Scapegoat... scape... escape... Escape Goat!" - and everything just flows from there.  It's risky to force inspiration by trying to design a game around a cute title, but in this case the result is surprisingly fun.\n\nEscape Goat is exactly what it says on the tin.  You control a goat, and you have to solve puzzles to escape rooms.  The puzzles are of the "touch this switch to open the wall to grab the key" variety.  The retro graphical style reminds me of some early arcade games, and fits well with the gameplay.  I'm not a huge fan of the current trend of making everything look 8-bit, but it feels appropriate for this game.\n\nThere's not a lot of depth to be found here.  Your goat can move, jump, double jump, and ram things.  Early on you befriend a mouse who can climb walls and (on some levels) switch places with you.  Each room is a single non-scrolling screen, with switches placed here and there.  Sometimes there is a correct order you need to press the switches, in order to open the right wall to give you access to the next switch.  Sometimes you'll need your mouse companion to hold down one switch while you jump over to the next one, or you'll have to send the mouse through small openings to trigger switches you can't reach.  On some levels you face fire-throwing wizards, deadly traps, and other obstacles.  These hinderances can be exploited in your favor; for example, a well-dodged fireball can destroy a crate that was blocking your way.\n\nThe level design is great.  As a casual gamer I found the difficulty level to be just about right, though some of the levels took more than a few tries to figure out.  You usually have a choice of levels to play, so if you get stuck, you can always try a different set of levels for a while.  The game was designed to work best with a controller, but I used a keyboard and had no trouble.\n\nBottom line:  Escape Goat is not very involving, or very pretty, but it's a fun time-waster.","May 16, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is particularly amazing as well.\n\nI can't recommend playing the All Intensive Purposes bonus levels, however.

I didn't expect to get in to this game as much as I did, but Escape Goat has some solid puzzles, the platforming is tough at times, and I ended up really enjoying it.\n\nThe story is basically non-existent. The music and sound are enjoyable. The graphics remind me of 16-bit-era PC games, and I think they look great. The game controls well on an X360 controller (didn't test keyboard).\n\nThis game is really very elegant. There are only a few things you can do: double jump, rush, and teleport (if you have the hat), and the mouse can do a handful of things by himself as he runs around. Similarly, the level design only uses a few elements to pull together some interesting and tough puzzles. The game isn't terribly hard (unless you play the bonus content), but it makes you earn your prison escape, and it feels satisfying when you do. I'm probably going to keep playing a bit longer to get a few more of the achievements that I missed the first time.\n\nThis game is a solid puzzle platformer, and if that sounds like something you enjoy, pick up Escape Goat. It's cheap, and for $5, this is a pretty good way to kill an afternoon.","October 10, 2013","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rescue the sheep’s that the reapers (your foes) keep in the dungeon and escape with them to your freedom. Gameplay- wise ESCAPE GOAT is a typical puzzle platformer. The only difference is your mouse. She is small but that's what makes her so useful. See a small gap your goat doesn't fit through? Send out your mouse! She is also able to climn walls and so, she can push buttons that might be in a spot you can't reach with your jumps. The levels are cleverly designed and every one of them looks and plays unique. The pixel-art in this game is very clean and well-polished and i should not forget the amazing soundtrack that plays while you are scratching your head because you don't know where to use that mouse.

It's an unique combination of puzzle and plataforming that tests very well your reflexes, cordination and in some cases also planning ahead of time and observation, with the uses of your mouse companion and the magic hat in some levels adding a bit more to the puzzles.\n\nThe game can be quite hard and it can be a nuisance when you are about to exit the level when suddenly you died by some cause you didn't see. However, the game is the kind of hard that is challenging, rewarding and keeps you wanting for more instead of frustrating and the shortness of the levels help a lot. I only had to watch a guide for one of the levels. The music is also very charming and catchy, the controls (atleast with an Xbox 360 pad) are precise and the graphics and art are nice, even if there's not a lot of variety in the scenery except some small colors and detail changes.\n\nI bought Escape Goat back when it was on sale by one buck, though I think the normal price tag justifies the sale, as it also includes a level editor and an extra set of REALLY hard levels made by users after you completed the main story. If you really like puzzle games and/or plataformers, and don't mind the shortness, you should check this game out.

Its concept is so unique and novel. The best part is that Ian Stocker didn't spoil the fun by making one too many sequels like Scott Cawthon did in his Five Nights at Freddy's Trilogy.\n\nThe mechanics are very smooth and consistent as far as I can tell, and its levels provide enough challenge to suit the taste of most gamers in a package that is compatible with virtually any computer.  The game lets you take control of a quirky goat protagonist and gives you remote control of its mouse sidekick as they attempt to escape prison.  When you are not using the magical hat to allow the goat and the mouse to switch places on a stage, you are pressing buttons or lighting torches to alter the environment to reach the exit.  The default hotkeys for all the abilities, though, may catch you offguard, but all in all, this is a really good game.","August 2, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It presents a challenge but makes you feel pretty smart and talented for surpassing it.\n\nDifficulty is subjective, but I found the main levels very much in the Goldilocks (just right) realm.  There are a few challenging levels for your reflexes but most of the levels require more thought and planning than raw skill.  It also helps that there's a quick level restart button if things go wrong.\n\nThere is also a set of bonus extra difficult levels you can play after completing the main set.

Its concept is so unique and novel. The best part is that Ian Stocker didn't spoil the fun by making one too many sequels like Scott Cawthon did in his Five Nights at Freddy's Trilogy.\n\nThe mechanics are very smooth and consistent as far as I can tell, and its levels provide enough challenge to suit the taste of most gamers in a package that is compatible with virtually any computer.  The game lets you take control of a quirky goat protagonist and gives you remote control of its mouse sidekick as they attempt to escape prison.  When you are not using the magical hat to allow the goat and the mouse to switch places on a stage, you are pressing buttons or lighting torches to alter the environment to reach the exit.  The default hotkeys for all the abilities, though, may catch you offguard, but all in all, this is a really good game.","August 2, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many of the puzzles in the initial game are simple enough with a few challenging levels here and there that can be completed without being killed too terribly much and the first set can be completed within a couple of hours tops.  Once you've completed this fun set of levels, you unlock the extreme difficulty set of levels in another zone.  These appear to be designed more toward the crowd that likes rage games as the difficulty takes a massive spike upward for these.  Expect to die nearly non-stop on the extreme levels.  I have no idea if there is a third set of levels past the second group as the second group feels nearly impossible to complete, and I'm a veteran gamer.\n\nThe music is pretty great and goes well with the game.  This is a good thing since you'll be hearing the same tracks a lot once you reach the extreme difficulty.\n\nControls feel a little floaty at times, especially when you're trying to make precision jumps to small platforms.  It gives you a tendancy to either fall short of your jump or slide past it.  This can lead to some minor frustration in the easy levels and be downright infuriating in the extreme levels.\n\nLevel design is really good.  It feels like they could have included an intermediate set of levels to help smooth the transition along to the extreme levels.  That's assuming the extreme levels aren't actually the intermediate ones, though I can't imagine how that would be possible given how incredibly hard the game got after the easy set.\n\nOverall this is a great little 2d platform puzzle game that everyone should at least give a try.  Unless you're a completionist or masochist, I wouldn't recommend doing more than taking a cursory look at the extreme difficulty levels once you're through the easy set as you'll be beating your head against the game for what feels like hours just to complete a single room at that point.","December 26, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
