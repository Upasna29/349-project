Can't wait to see how it shapes up over the course of Early Access.\n\nPros:\n- Faster pace than the original - very frantic and enjoyable in combination with the new shield/energy mechanic\n- New GRID mode is great\n- The updated graphics are very shiny!\n\nCons:\n- I may need new right thumbstick for my 360 controller by the time this game makes it to full release!","December 18, 2015","true","6.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","13","14","3","0"

Very different from the original with many great changes.  Hope a lot more gets fixed during the early access phase.\n\nPros:\n+ Huge replay-ability\n+ Beautiful Visuals\n+ Nodes offer great challenge\n+ Lots of smart additions to the original\n+ Challenging arenas\n\nCons:\n- Same terrible song over and over (worse than all songs from the original)\n- Audible triggers and queues are tough to distinguish\n- Loadout section makes no sense at all\n- Cubes seem nearly impossible to kill now\n\nWish List:\n- Explanation of the loadout screen\n- Make killing cubes a bit easier (seems like sure death when one shows up)\n- More track selection, or allow for custom tracks to be added via music folder like GTA5\n- Multiplayer support\n- Better sense of accomplishment progressing through the grid\n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite twin stick shooters now, but I just hope a few of the cons get fixed up in the upcoming patches.  Keep up the great work devs!\n","February 13","true","3.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Hope there will be more optimisation here since it lags really hard.\nUPD: Thanks, everything is really awesome! Performance is great and I can finally enjoy.","December 17, 2015","true","0.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","1"

Now it is easier to get lost and aim will more often blend into all the action than before. This gives gamepad controller a advantage at the moment compared to the first Waves game.\n\nAlso the game i wish that we get to have the field also that was used in Waves 1. Having a new field also is much welcome.\n\nAnd I wish to find some more configurability of this game, there should be more options..\n\nIt is a interesting game i like to see much more of. Minimalistic shooter games like this are close to the ideal arcade games to me. This is the #1 of its kind.","January 3","true","58.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

But what i look foward to is the developer considering to put at least a few different enemies in its stage of early development so it wont feel like im playing the same game again only with a new engine and look. One bug i found in the game is where i had the resolution at 1280x720, my preferred resolution. But when i came to play the game again, the resolution was at 1024x728. I'd rather have my game keeping the resolution than everytime you need to put it back to your preferred resolution,would'nt you? Anyway, everytime i launched the game, i had to put the resolution at 1280x720 because it seems as if when i close the game,the resolution resets to 1024x728. It also resets to that resolution whenever i Tab+Alt myself out of the game then come back. I like how they made it a little more easy where the slow-motion ability bar is also your health bar, but maybe you can add a option to the modes where you can choose the new feature, which is what i stated, or have it the way it was in the predecessor, where you die instantly when you get hit by an enemy. Overall, this game is a great sequel and holds much potential. Lastly, please fix the bug in your next update for the game.","December 17, 2015","true","5.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","1"

The progression system and Grid mode seemed somewhat iffy at first, but after playing through them more I like it. I prefer Arcade mode to Grid, but there's nothing forcing you to play Grid since you can earn credits anywhere. It can also be somewhat annoying to be 3 credits from an 150 upgrade and to know you'll have to do an entire level just to get those three, but overall the progression seems a decent speed.\n\nIt's already better than the original, but it could use a few more modes and perhaps another enemy type (Boss?) to make it feel more like a new addition rather than Waves 1 with a weapons and abilities DLC.","June 5","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
