"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/343000/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","For the sake of being fair, I'd like to declare that I'm an enthusiastic and meticulous adventure gamer. I love adventure games. I love story exploration, I love puzzles and growing up playing older games in this genre, I do not expect much on either graphics or even logic department in these games. I've played my fair share of obscure adventure games from old to new, shiny to buggy, and from "masterful" to "lame". So, don't take my word lightly when I say that The Mystery of the Druids was one of my worst experiences so far.\n\nHere in this obscure little adventure, our protagonist is Brent Halligan, a Scotland Yard detective and a mischievous, good for nothing trouble maker with a disdain for anything orderly. It's the year 2000 - a period when people were completely engulfed by conspiracy theories and hypothetical occult sub-meanings for everything with the shadow of a word called "millennium" attached - and London's been haunted by gruesome serial killings called Skeleton Murders. Due to some drastic errors the last detective handling the case caused, it becomes our case over a night. Halligan's adventure starting up with a trip to Anthropology Museum, progresses to involve rituals of ancient times and an age old sect in Britannia: Druids. Alongside Dr. Melanie Turner - a stereotypical maiden with a sharp tongue, Brent starts his gruesome and somewhat mindless quest to solve the mystery behind this whole shabby picture.\n\nOkay, first and foremost: the lore presented within the game is speculative, corrupted and elongated to extremes. The term "Druid" is completely ill-advertised, displayed a long cultural heritage and spiritual practice of 5000 years simply as "power hungry elemental wizards". This is kinda infuriating for someone who is actually familiar with the topic, and itâ€™s both cultural and spiritual indications. It is understandable that any mythical or mystical practice would be interesting enough theme for a "bad guy" in any story, but one would at least expect them to present the concept with some authenticity. Please don't take your basic information on druidism from this game only! You'd end up learning some beautiful concept completely wrong!\n\nNow, back to the game itself: as a game made in 2001, graphics are ridiculously bad! I mean, we are talking about "first Tomb Raider quality" bad. I know, it was charming in 1996, but in 2001, one would expect slightly better. Character animations are almost cubical, movement animations are painfully solid and background artwork lacks any animation altogether. Everything seems plastic and even funny in a bad way. Remember; The Longest Journey was developed 2 years before this game! So the lack of technology is not an excuse at all! No one decided to put either any skill or labor in this game, that's all.\n\nThe game's Steam integration is also non-existent. It's ridden with animation bugs, constant game crashes and cyclical dialogue errors. After my 14th crash at the very same point in the middle of the game; I gave up, shut it down and watched a youtube playthrough made with an original copy of the game just to learn the rest of the story. Aside game breaking constant bugs; there is no observable logic behind puzzle dynamics and dialogue options force you to take completely linear progression paths. It doesn't matter whether you know what to do next or not: the game makes sure you should try what you cannot achieve first, then force you back to the actual solution. You should keep guessing the specific way of thinking in developer's mind to be able to accomplish your next task. Either you get lucky, or give up and get yourself a walkthrough.\n\nFor the last verdict: even with a ridiculously cheap price, The Mystery of the Druids won't bring you either excitement, or accomplishment; or even enjoyment. You'll get yourself a cheap story with no causal logic, plain ugly environment, a series of constant restarts due to crashes and a headache. This game is an annoying little trap in hopes of milking a nickel or two from an adventure lover. Stay away from it!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 27, 2015","false","8.8"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","41","47","0","0"

Being that this is a point-and-click adventure game, a genre well-known for having ridiculous puzzles and, at times, even more ridiculous characters... I do, in a twisted sense, sort of recommend playing it for yourself.\n\nAlas, the game was originally designed for computers running Windows 98/XP, and Nordic's attempts to get it working properly on modern systems haven't quite been perfected yet, so you will most likely experience crashes every five minutes or so. Until the day this becomes more functional, I'd say just hunt down a copy of the original retail game and fire up your old XP computer instead.","April 10, 2015","false","0.2"," 42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","42","51","2","0"

Recently I decided to pick it up again and I assume it could be quite an entertaining game if it weren't for all this crashing and screen flickering (Windows 7). Plus the fact that most major items are literally indistinguishable from background visuals. You may need a guide for even the earliest plot advances.\n\nSo... yeah, it's not really playable as is. Might work on something like Windows 2000 with everything on drive C: for safety reasons. Not recommended anymore.","July 28, 2015","false","1.3"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

THIS IS A BIG WARNING FOR ANY WNIDOW 7,8 AND 10 USERS! DON'T BUY THIS IF UR USING IT ON ANY OF THESE SYSTEMS ONLY BUY IT IF U HAVE A WINDOWS VISTA OR OLDER. I'D JUST GET IT FOR WINDOWS XP ON THE SAFE SIDE! I PLAYED THIS WHEN IT WAS ON DISK I JUST BOUGHT THE STEAM VERSION SO I COULD WRITE A REVIEW FOR IT AND TRIED PLAYING THE STEAM VERSION AND KEEPS CRASHIN 10 MINS IN. I'VEPLAYED THISBEFORE AND COMPLETED AND THIS IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE WORST POINT AND CLICK GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED! THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING SINCE I'D SAY I'VE PLAYED AROUND 100 POINT AND CLICK GAMES IN MY LIFE BECAUSE THEY WERE THE FIRST GENRE I STARTED PLAYING WHEN I WAS A BABY (started playing them when I was 2)\n\nI'll actually start talking about mystery of the druids. It's a point and click adventure game released in 2001 by the company house of tales. I've played other house of tales point and click games before and the only one that seemed any good was moment of silence but it wasn't noteworthy or anything. This was the first game relaeased by said company after the second death of adventure games. They attempted to revive the genre but failed misserably.\n\nYou play as Scotland yard detective Brent Halligan who's put on the mysterious murder case dubed "The skeleton murders" and your main objective is to solve them. This already has a great concept except that the said concept just fealt wasted. This was a great chance to actually make gamers feel like they were detectives and to use the resources of Scotland Yard in order to help you but issues come up later in the game that hold it back.\n\nOne thing I'll give the game credit for is the opening.... Or the trailer for the game as they are the exact same thing. It is very atmospheric and well laid out and has a mystery feeling for it and has good graphics for cutscenes in 2001. If only I could say the same for the actual game's graphics. When you're in game the backgrounds look good enough but it's the character models. It looks like they were formed out of a cardboard box. The only one that looks consistantly OK is Halligan but you won't be paying much attention to Halligan as since this is an adventure game you'll be looking at the rest of the screen for clues. Same problem as Harvester, this style of characters with this type of background make the game's style look worse.\n\nAnother thing I have to talk about are the puzzles. Similar to Harvester (see my review on that formore info) I can't really call the puzzles in mystery of the druids puzzles, but not for the same reasons Harvester had. Whereas Harvester had puzzles that were so simply mundane, mystery of the druids dosn't exactly have puzzles at all. It's mainly just tricking people. For some reason everyone living in Scotland and even his own colleagues hate Halligan's guts. Don't believe me, here's the opening puzzle. Halligan needs to ring a proffesor at a museum for an expert's opinion on one of the bones. Trouble is Halligan (like other adventure game heroes) dosn't have any money. However,lucky for Halligan, there is a beggar with a few coins in his hat. The beggar dosn't let Halligan take his money. So Halligan heads back to Scotland yard and gets poison from the science lab and pours it in with some apple juice and gives it to the beggar and when the beggar is knocked out Halligan takes the beggar's few measley coins and rings the proffessor. BUT THINGS ABOUT THIS PUZZLE GET WORSE AND MAKES IT FEEL LIKE I HAVN'T ACCOMPLISHED ANYTHING. THE SAID PROFFESSOR ISN'T IN THE MUSEUM AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS! THE PROFFESSOR NOT BEING IN ISN'T THE WORST PART OF IT ALL! THE WORST PART OF IT IS THAT HALLIGAN HAS A DESK PHONE BACK AT SCOTLAND YARD! I CANT USE THAT TO SOLVE THE ABSOLUTELY "COMPLEX PUZZLE" THAT THIS GAME HAS THROWN AT US. THE ACTUAL RESOULTION OF IT IS FOR A DETECTIVE OF SCOTLAND YARD TO POISON A BEGGAR AND TAKE HIS CHANGE! WHAT WERE THE "PUZZLE" DESIGNERS THINKING WHEN DOING THIS PUZZLE "Hey why don't we have a puzle where Halligan needs to tke money from a beggar who is given an emotional backstory and for the player to shake their heads in shame at Halligan HAHAHHAHAAHAH" We're not shaking our heads at Halligan.We're shakingour heads at u. All of the other puzzles follow this same thing by tricking people.\n\nWant me to tell you what I think is the funniest puzzle in the game is..... if you don't scroll down to the next paragraph if you do continue reading on. About a quarter of the way through the game Halligan heads to France in order to find an ancient amulet inside a castle. You now need to blow it up. What do you blow it up with? SALT (for some reason!) and you won't believe how you get the salt! If you think that you can go to a restaurant in France and get it off a table you're wrong. First you need to capture a cat under a scarf then release said cat in order to knock over a fisherman's bait into the water so that he'll leave his rod so that Halligan can steal it then combine it with a bucket nd scrape some off the side of a ferry.\n\nI also know for a fact that this game has been translated mainy because when Halligan says "pizza" he pronounces it "Pitza" "Al's pitza palace makes the best pitza in London"\n\nI can't exactly think of any characters that stood out in the game either, like most point and click games. Just ordinary characters with none sticking out in mind.\n\nThis game is so bad that it's good but it's so bad that it shouldn't be played so it might be best just to watch gameplay  instead of playing it\n\nFinal verdict\n\nPros\n+ So bad it's good\n+ Good cinematics\n+ Good backgrounds\n+ Good setup\nCons\n- Bad voice acting\n- Bad translation\n- Badly designed puzzles\n- Bad lip syncs\n- Bad performance\n- Bad character models\n- Uninteresting characters\n\nFinal verdict: 3/10\n\nHere are some much better point and click games that are worth your money more than mystery of the druids\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/32360/ and this http://store.steampowered.com/app/57640/\n\nSteam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","December 27, 2015","false","1.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","0"
