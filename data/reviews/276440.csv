It feels somewhat like a F2P title that somehow managed to get itself released onto Steam. There's no real fun to be had out of this one, I'm afraid.\n\nDon't get me wrong. It's polished, the music is passable and apart from the slightly pathetic dialogue, it certainly seems functional... But the simple fact that the gameplay boils down to "Click here, watch as the same thing that's happened a hundred dozen times happens again, or don't click here and fail the level" really sort of ruins the experience.\n\nIt claims to be a 'fun time management/strategy game'. It's just a giant time-sink... You can practically smell the skinner box.\n\nDon't be fooled by the Settlers-like screenshots. This isn't worth your time. Avoid.","February 13, 2014","false","0.3"," 128 of 142 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","128","142","0","0"

It looks nice enough but the whole strategy boils down to clicking on buttons to collect resources, building placement on predefined plots, and resource and time management.  The resource gathering forces you to click icons when they appear, that otherwise in most games is automated.  You even need to click a button to have them get water when they are thirsty.\n\nEnemies are little more than barricades that must be removed by paying a certain amount of resources making what passes for combat feel anticlimatic.  In fact beating the levels I did get to left me feeling that way.  I just had big desire to progress onward knowing that all that awaited was more resources to click away at, more monsters that would only cost more to defeat, and more buildings that would require unnecessary micromanaging.\n\nIn fairness, if your looking for something to eat time just slightly funner than staring into empty space, this might work for you.  For the rest of us, I'd take a pass.","February 13, 2014","false","0.6"," 57 of 64 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","57","64","0","0"

The game is absolute garbage.\n\nEverything about the game is just… bad. I could not find any enjoyment in the title at all. The game feels more like a F2P Facebook game than an actual “game”. The game does do a good job with its graphics, music, and dialogue, but the gameplay is utterly terrible. The gameplay consists of time and resource management, that is all. It’s done in such a way that I couldn’t help but compare it to today’s Facebook games. All you have to do, as the player, is click and wait. This needs to be done over and over and over and over.\n\nCan’t recommend the game, even if it were to go for $0.50. It’s simply not worth the bandwidth used by the game’s download, nothing else too it.","March 27, 2014","false","0.4"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/276440/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","Kingdom Tales is a casual time and resource management game where you build establishments to earn money and other resources to complete missions. It's rather mediocre but still enjoyable until you grow bored of the rules that only slightly change over the campaign. At least graphics are pretty and atmosphere is nice and fluffy. So, what about the game aspect?\n\nBasically, in each mission you'll establish a production cycle that earns you money that is used to build special structures and cut stones (the other resource). Stone is used to build money generating buildings and other structures. Money is generated by clicking icons that pop up when the building has produced a patch of taxes. Then your tax collectors will rush to bring the gold back to the castle. Profit!\n\nSo the mechanics are very simple and repetitive and approaching dull. Most everything happens with one or two clicks. A naive story of getting friendly with the dragons runs along by completing the missions of each level. Missions range from gathering enough gold to killing all the wild animals and monsters (which simply costs money and/or mana that is a resource unlocked later) to building certain buildings and upgrades. While the mechanics are always the same, they are used in many ways within the story: early on you'll be saving the tree of life, helping some druids and loading up ships for a journey.\n\nThe full completion of the game takes only several hours: for me this was less than 5. The game is rather unchallenging. There are 9 in-game achievements that would be nice to see on Steam as well, but they are very easy to attain.\n\nIt's a decent, though rather short time waster. Though I initially recommended the game, I've decided to revoke my recommendation because of the utter repetitive nature of the game that becomes boring half-way through. It was somewhat worth its discounted price though because the story was so cute.\n\nif you'd like to test the game out anyway, a demo is available at bigfishgames.com:\nhttp://www.bigfishgames.com/download-games/23538/kingdom-tales/index.html","February 13, 2014","false","4.7"," 42 of 63 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","42","63","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/276440/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Kingdom Tales tasks you to lead of a fledgling nation and travel the land in search of a legendary dragon. The game is best described as a 'real-time strategy game for beginners'. The game contains forty-five scenarios spread out over nine chapters. Each has a fixed amount of buildings plots in which you are able to erect one of three groups of buildings - Homes, Production and Magic.As you progress, new buildings are introduced, keeping the learning curve quite sedate. With only three to four buildings available in each category and most upgraded buildings having the exact same function as their smaller counterparts, there really isn’t much to learn. Of course, buildings require resources, as do workers. Gold is the primary resource, collected from the taxes on habitable dwellings.Each scenario has its own goals, be it collecting a certain amount of a particular resource, completing a certain number buildings or defeating whatever enemy units are standing in your way. Graphically, Kingdom Tales looks similar to the early 1990's title Settlers II. The settings are vibrant and colourful, the buildings are easy to distinguish and the menu system is clear and uncluttered.The audio is cheerful, with birds singing along merrily in the background as your peasants do their thing. Kingdom Tales is a game that feels as though it is much better suited to the mobile gaming crowd.The game is fun for awhile, but as you progress and realise that one level is primarily the same as the next, it begins to become dull. There isn't much substance to the game to make it appealing in the long term. All in all, Kingdom Tales is probably best suited as a way of introducing youngsters into full-blown real-time strategies than anything else.Overall 5/10.","October 5, 2014","true","5.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","1"

Kingdom Tales is a casual strategy game, you would expect on Facebook (but without the real payments ofcourse) or any browser game site. It's obvious, the developers targeted a young audience, so it may not be fair to review this as an adult.\n\nKingdom Tales looks cute but other then that the game only consists of clicking on icons. There's no difficulty and does't require thinking. A lot of languages are included in the game, so if you got some young kids, they might have a blast with this game.","May 13, 2015","false","0.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

It's very simple, yet fun. It doesn't take any skill to play, though.\nYou go through levels, to win the level you build houses and cottages to generate money,\nwhich you can then use to build resource buildings. You have an unlimited amount of workers, which makes it too easy, and basically all you do is click. I read somewhere that there were a few glitches in the game, so far I haven't noticed anything except for a typo.

It has the resource management of an RTS but without any of the unit building or fighting that makes those games fun. Even as you progress you unlock higher level buildings but they take more resources so you really aren't progressing because the start of each level you have to sit there with 1 building and just wait until you collect money 20 times and then you can slowly build more. All the game is is clicking to collect and build a gold, water, magic, or wood resource building. Every level is pretty much the exact same. Basically no story. This game feels like it was designed for facebook or free to play mobile app. I finally just got sick of it and gave up. 5/10.","February 22, 2015","false","4.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
