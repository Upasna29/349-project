Street Racing Syndicate has all the fun of a solid, easy to play street racing game with a lot of open world frills to keep it interesting. Its a deep game full of customization, unlockables and still everything feels like an earned reward from winning a bet to unlocking cars, girlfriends and videos of them.\n\nYou have an open world Los Angeles at night. A big broad area that strays from details like side streets and allies. There is plenty to do here and I'll start with some of the side missions before I go into detail about everything else. You can find street challenges from cars that just sit waiting for you to offer cash in an open circuit challenge one-on-one. On the road there are other vehicles looking for a race. Get up behind them, flash your high beams and its on. Outside of racing there is a garage, a dealership, the warehouse where all of the women are stored and even three cruises that let you soak up the city as your car drives for you. Its a good use of the game's city.\n\nFor anyone that wants to get to the event rather than drive to it, the game lets you have that option with the map. The sad thing is nothing is on your mini map. You need to hop in the big map and select your next location in a menu and whether you want to jump to it or drive.\n\nSince this is an open world, there are cops here and there. Police never interfere with races, but when you're outside a race and you speed by, they'll chase you. These chases have a meter how close you are to escaping or being busted and I say this meter and the game itself is glitched here. I've been in front of police cars and hear over the radio that they can't find me. Other times I've been busted with the cops far behind me. Its a toss up whether this is bad or good, but just take it easy around police. The game will warn you when they're in the area.\n\nThe bulk of the game is in crew meets where you race in a series of three different races on three tiers. Each race and tier takes place in the same area, so it modifies the course a bit each time. It makes for thirty-two races in four areas from the start. Before each race of the series, you can select to place a side bet with one of the three competitors. If you beat them, you get the money and if you lose, then it costs you.\n\nA nice touch is being able to see the stats of the vehicles you can bet against. I say just bet the one offering the most money. As they win or lose through betting, their cash will increase or decrease, so it turns into an issue of beating the same person means others will have more money by the final race. Its incentive to bet against others.\n\nTo unlock the next tier, you need cars with a minimum horsepower and you need enough respect. This respect is earned by winning races and you can get some bonus respect here and there for slides, near misses, overtaking competition and some air off of a bump. If you knock into anything before your respect is calculated you lose it, but its no big loss since winning races gives far more respect.\n\nWomen and racing have always gone together, but wow does Street Racing Syndicate plaster them all over the game, its menus and on its streets. It makes the game different in a laughable, offensive or great way depending on your perspective. The women offer a variety of challenges. Everything from checkpoint rallies and big air competition to chasing them in their own street rides. Once they become your girlfriend they then hang out at the warehouse. Your own harem of women that you select one to roll with who will drop the go signal at each race. For those out there into videos there are provocative videos of the real women these girlfriends are based after. Someone had to chose to put these videos into the game. It goes a step beyond and an extra frill to keep you in game.\n\nStreet Racing Syndicate blurs the line for me between an easy to play arcade game and more of a realistic game. Your car takes damage and after enough damage your car starts to drag a little. You can either instantly repair it at any event or you can take a drive to the only garage in the city. These repairs cost money, so try to stay away from obstacles.\n\nNitrous is a luxury instead of a given, because you need to buy it at the garage. Using the nitro boost is still a challenge, you need to hold it down to see any significant momentum, because when you use it, your opponents will too. Its easy to just forget about it until the top tier races at the crew meets.\n\nOn the mid tier races, your competitors are like jackals that hang around you, waiting for the proper moment to overtake you either with a mistake or a wide straightaway. This pushes the pace and depends you to avoid making major mistakes. The intelligence of the others feels top notch. They can avoid my reckless driving and compensate for a lot of different factors. Its very subtle and you need to go to great lengths to reveal it.\n\nI need to speak up about one crew meet that drives on an abandon racetrack at dusk where the sun is right in your eyes. The flare is giant and as a human I have a difficult time seeing through it. To the game's credit, there's nothing to bump into as you stare at the sun, but you can miss a hairpin turn and slam into a wall. Another thing that the game loves to do is put civilian vehicles in front of you going into turns. I've lost the final few seconds of mid tier races thanks to a well timed taxi.\n\nThe customization goes to the furthest depths of the deep end. You can get lost looking at all of the ways to customize the look of your car. Spoilers, stickers, paint jobs, body kits, electronics, lights and so on. That's just the look though, you can upgrade each of your fifty unlockable cars with engines, mufflers, exhaust, and everything else that I will never fully understand. All I know is that each thing costs money and tweaks the stats ever so slight.y\n\nWith all of these upgrades and even purchasing vehicles, the worst part is the navigation to do so. You look at manufacturers and then you look at the parts. Switching between parts creates a load image so you need to remember which part had what stats. I wish there was just an easy way to see what I needed or even to compare them.\n\nOn the plus side there are a lot of real world vehicles and companies. So many get stuffed into this game that it almost feels like an advertisement complete with billboards.\n\nOutside of the real game is an arcade with a few different modes and races. These are one off events that take place in Miami, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. I'm happy to have Miami, because its the only city that yous race in the daytime. It makes the city feel far different than the other two and lets you see its beauty rather than darkness. You can unlock plenty of new vehicles in the arcade. I'd love to unlock new cities, but with four hours in, I've seen no hint of such a thing.\n\nThe game allows for controllers and controls easy with them, but the menus are still listed as keys so you need to remember what you have them set as.\n\nStreet Racing Syndicate is a fun, engaging, immersive and well comical game with its overuse of certain things. Well worth the cheap asking price.","September 25, 2015","true","4.8"," 55 of 66 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","55","66","7","0"

I grew up on NAMCO when they were in the arcades so when it came to this game it reminded me of playing Tokyo Xtreme Racer which was also another awesome, but simple title. The Graphics were not the best, but still this was just classic. Also any racing game with a Nissan Skyline are worth playing. This is a great game too bad games are not like this anymore now its learning a whole system of mumbo jumbo this game you race, you win, you snag the import tuner models(well I have not gotten to that part dont know if its still in the game or not), and you have many customization options that are not even present in most racing games i.e (grid 2) so yeah i love this game its just too bad their is not multiplayer and its funny how the game goes into sleep mode when you click the sign in button lol.","April 24, 2014","true","4.0"," 59 of 73 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","59","73","0","1"

First and Foremost, If you're looking for a game thats entirely seamless and has top of the line graphics on the vehicles, You may as well stop this review, and head to another page, as this game is nearly 10 years old now (Came out late 2005).\n\nWith that aside, SRS has many features that even most current games do not give you the luxury of changing anymore.\n\nThe Pros:\n1) Get to Customize your car [i.e. weight reduction (for carbon fiber peices), A Body kit (sadly, only 1 for each car i have tried that is... beside the stock body), Underglow (to which you can change between about 8 different colors), Body+Rim paint, etc.]\n2) You get to choose which parts can go onto the car, they have about a 18 parts from real life authenticated part manufacturer's that you can use to upgrade your car with, turning that 343HP Nissan GT-R, Into a 918HP AWD Road Beast ;)...\n3) The game is fairly realistic in its driving (except the fact you can obviously keep driving after hitting someone going 120... but hey, its a video game), But on that note. You dont want to go around and wall grind around corners like alot of people do in NFS. It makes for a very costly repair bill after your races.\n4) ^ In note with that, It honestly makes you a consious driver, As you NEED to avoid obsticicles if you want to start earning money toward that awesome car you're waiting for, Giving it that realistic feel. (Repair bills are a B!@#$.)\n5) What it adds over the other games, Is the fact you can free roam everywhere without limitations toward the map. (But the map in its own is fairly small and rugged)\n6) Races are gauged by a 'Respect' system, You earn respect by running races quickly and cleanly, And throwing in a bit of spice to mix the pot.\n7) [and probably the best/most reason everyone whose played the game prior for] The girls. Yes, As you race, you get the chance to earn yourself a Girlfriend, (18 in total, all unique, their own descriptions and they even went as far as to add comments as to what they like) Each girl has 3 Videos of them dancing as you race with them tagging along with you. (Except for one, which i heard is bugged with only 1 video, unsure as to which one so far)\n\nThe Cons:\n1) The graphics are pretty out-dated (but hey... its 2014, and this is a 2005 game, still not the worst..[could always go back to GTA2?.. bahaha])\n2) The maps are small.\n3) There is no real story to the game.\n4) To those of you whom play RPG games, This Racer has a 'Grinding' feel to it. As you end up repeating alot of races in order to get the car/upgrades that you desire.\n5) The modifications are pretty limited, (both tuning wise and cosmeticly)\n6) A (decent, but) Small quantity of vehicles to choose from. [If you are into muscle/luxury cars, and dont like racing with anything else, dont bother with this game, as it deals with mainly tuner styled cars (save for the Lexus IS300)]\n7) The game goes by fairly quickly, I've got just under 9 hours on record currently, and i already have the 2nd most expensive car, and beaten nearly every race perfectly.\n8) Is meant as a keyboard game, Not fully integrated for PS3/xbox360 controller use.\n\nAll in all, I would definately recommend this game for those of you who are nostalgic with old racing games (weather it be this one specifically or racing in general) But would definately just add it to your wishlist untill it comes on sale, unless you're die-hard for those videos ;) haha.\n\n**As a side note, For anyone who plays/buys the game, keep in mind that upgrading and buying high-end modifications for your vehicle wont always make it the fastest, weather the fact its a bug in the game [which would not suprise me] Or just the way the designed it.\n\nAs an example. I've got the Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VIII ('04 model) [which is unlocked before the '02 Evo VII]. Did a few minor modiciations to it, bringing it from the 200HP or so it started at, up to 814HP. It will go 0-60 in 2.5 seconds, But the top speed maxes out at a measly 160mph (claims 162, but i couldnt pull it off, even downhill).\nWhile on the other hand, I have a Mazda RX-7, which has about 740HP, but maxes out at a stunning 190mph.\n\nIf you have any questions, Please drop me a comment, and i'll do my best to help out.","November 15, 2014","true","10.6"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/292410/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Street Racing Syndicate is an arcade racing game, created on the wave of astonishing success of the Need for Speed Underground. There were plenty of them back in the days, but only a few deserves our attention after all those years passed. If you need comparisons, I'd say that SRS is more realistic than NFS Underground 1 & 2, and have some unique features to hold player's interest - the most noticeable, the down-to-earth system of upgrades, and, of course, girls. Girls who encouraging the player with the original driving quests, and awards with private go-go dances, once you achieve something on the streets.\n\nAs of downsides, the game is quite dated at moment (released in 2005), and it is not a "living classic", like NFS games. Sadly, even being more fair with player than NFS, Street Racing Syndicate is not possessing the fleur of the "legend in flash". Which is more, it lacks the drive that raised NFS Underground so high. The driving in the open world could be the pain in the back, as the map is not just slightly informative... and gosh, how many coppers there on patrol?! It's really hard to speed there, staying under the radar.\n\nOverall, I can't hardly recommend it. Get it on sale, or bundled, if you're up to some arcade racing with open world, where cars not bouncing from the border lines, maintaining speed. Where you have to pay for repairs, which urges you to drive a bit more carefully. Where you have your own club of long-legged female venerators... however low it may sound, it feels alright, try it sometimes.\n\nMy personal mark will be 6.9/10. It's on the level with Juiced or just slightly not even with NFS Underground 2. But yeah, it's been about 12 years now, and there are plenty of newer open-world racing games, starting with TDU 2 or the Crew. None of them holds so much go-go dancing girls, of course, but I wouldn't buy the game just to look at dancing cuties.

Here's hoping they keep coming, I love these blasts from the both distant and recent past that have been appearing en masse on Steam lately.\n\nThat said, this game is okay in 2014. Not great, not bad, but unlike many other genres, sports and racing games tend to suffer a little more with age. The game looks fine considering its age and target platforms, and it runs easily at 60fps on modern equipment, but there's just not the greatest sense of speed present. That can be mitigated by switching to the hood camera, but really, that's never been one of my favorite views for driving games.\n\nThere's a deep career mode with a bare boned open-world element, a quick race mode, and seemingly endless menus of vehicle upgrades and customizations one could partake in. There's also plenty of "2 Fast, 2 Furious" type cheesiness if you want some laughs, and lots of weirdly sloped polygonal butts and boobs to ogle if that's your bag. Lots of fun to be had here for people with the proper mindset.","April 28, 2014","true","0.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

Also, at times, it will steer in the completely opposite direction of where you're trying to go if you're spinning out, making any sort of recovery impossible;\n\n-During drifts, it's clearly visible that front wheels are not attached to the cars;\n\n-While there are a lot of performance parts to upgrade you car with, they are all shared between cars, even on rotary engines;\n\n-Each car only has one aftermarket body kit;\n\n-It costs money to remove the rear seats;\n\n-There are upgrades that are completely useless due to having better and cheaper alternatives;\n\n-Weight of the car isn't displayed anywhere;\n\n-Dyno results don't match up with the car stats;\n\n-Most cars hit the rev limiter before the top speed from the stats can be actually reached;\n\n-No way to adjust the gear ratios, not even a top speed/acceleration slider;\n\n-Despite it being natuarally aspirated in the stats, the T-top Supra actually has a turbo, the opposite is true for the police car;\n\n-Adding an intercooler to a (actually) naturally aspirated car improves it's performance like it has a turbo;\n\n-Some suspension upgrades make the car more stable but understeery like hell;\n\n-There are movable, but fully solid carboard boxes that can roll your car;\n\n-There's no way to change to a non-outdated system of speed measurement (kanadian miles);\n\n-Doing the medium and hard Iron Man challenges will completely ruin the balance in Street Mode (career) by giving you stupidly overpowered cars;\n\n-Cars from Iron Man challenges come with an automatic gearbox;\n\n-You need to do the Easy Iron Man challenge to unlock the AE86;\n\n-The lights on the AE86 never close, even when the lights are off;\n\n-AE86 doesn't have any body kits;\n\n-A stock AE86 is incapable of going fast enough to ever be able to make use the 6th gear, meaning that Toyota put it there for no reason (it's also not there on the real car);\n\n-This 6th gear also gives the AE86 one of the highest top speeds in the game;\n\n-The rev counter on the AE86 goes up to 10k, despite redlining at 7k, no other car does this;\n\n-The hood on the AE86 opens in the wrong direction and has no visible hinges;\n\n-If you damage the edge of the rear bumper on the AE86, a large chunk of the car becomes see-through;\n\n-The AE86 doesn't support "universal" (any) spoilers;\n\n-Other racers never drive the AE86, nor the 1999 Eclipse;\n\n-There are two whole seperate cities that only exist for the sake of about 12 courses total;\n\n-The main city, Los Angeles isn't a bad place to drive around, but the only real reason to free roam it is to play a game of "Who can find the most environment pop-ins" with a friend;\n\n-A track named "Tunnel Z" doesn't go through the tunnel;\n\n-Cars are rated entierly by their horsepower, so you might not be able to enter some of the races even if your power to weight ratio and handling more than make up for lack of power;\n\n-Drafting is gives stupid amounts of speed when going slower but becomes useless as you get closer to the car's top speed;\n\n-Drafting doesn't work with traffic cars even when they are going much faster than the competition would;\n\n-Drafting only has any effect under acceleration;\n\n-The entire traffic consists of generic sedans, trucks and gloriously riced cars;\n\n-Hitting traffic cars at a certain angle will send them flying but won't cause damage to your car;\n\n-Damage on your car is sometimes applied to the side opposite of which you actually crashed;\n\n-The games only has about 12 hours of content;\n\n-Buying the Subaru at the start of the game makes everything very easy and boring for the first few hours;\n\n-The Skyline makes every other car in the game pointless and can be bought too early on;\n\n-Despite what the pre-rendered intro shows, there's no big rig with a trailer in traffic, nor cop chases mid-race;\n\n-The cop chases are more annoying than fun, cops going kamikaze to stop your car and your car being just instantly stopped if the Busted-Evade bar reaches full Busted. The bar is going down if the cops can see you and are anywhere near you, even when going 140+ mph;\n\n-The cops often cause so much damage to you car, it would just be cheaper to pull over and pay the fine, but the cops will still try to damage it even if you stop;\n\n-Some of the world is very abusable, making the cops lose you even when you're in plain sight;\n\n-After races, the game likes to spawn cops to chase you once you enter freeroam, which would be alright if it also didn't forget to make them go after you most of the time;\n\n-The cops can instanly and very obviously change direction by 180 dagrees (happens during nearly every 1-2 minute chase);\n\n-The top speed of the police Crown-Vic copy is 213mph, which makes it the fastest car in the game;\n\n-The police car has a "V8 Interceptor" logo but actually has in i6 engine;\n\n-The cops can do a full 360 on the spot while not moving;\n\n-Police radio audio is often cut off early;\n\n-Engine sounds randomly stop working for about 20 seconds, making you need to look at the rev conter to know when to change gear;\n\n-Shadow projection becomes a mess if you go near a wall in the direction of the sun;\n\n-There's a girl, who wants you to prove that you're not "all show" by asking you to do show-off moves;\n\n-Most of the girlfriend stuff is pretty cringy;\n\n-The flag girl doesn't react to being driven through;\n\n-All but two songs are complete cancer (at least you can turn music off)...\n\n\n"WHY THE HELL DO YOU RECOMMEND THIS??"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Croconaw/recommended/292410/","Croconaw","Croconaw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Croconaw/","2854 products in account","Street Racing Syndicate was originally released back in 2004 on pc and all the major consoles. Considering this pc port was made the same year, it's alright.\n\nAs a street racing game, it's pretty average, all things considered. Most of the races are pretty straightforward, you buy upgrades for your car between them, and you can drive around the city freely between races to find secrets. However, I greatly appreciated the feature that allowed you to instantly start any race from the map so you don't have to drive all the way there. Why more modern racing games still don't have that as a standard feature is beyond me.\n\nIf you're going to buy this, remember it's a 10-year-old pc game and they made no effort to update it. The max resolution you can achieve is 1260 x 960, so it won't look great on most modern setups. However, it still has a lot of scaling capabilities, and all the buttons can be freely remapped without any trouble. I managed to get my xbox 360 controller running without much of an issue, though I'd suggest manually setting the keys yourself because the default layout is a little weird.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty average game. If you're looking for something fun to play on a really outdated pc, or you just like street racing, you could do a lot worse than this.","May 16, 2014","true","1.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I remember when I got it in circa 2008 on a DVD with a computer magazine I used to love.\nI read the little "review" in the magazine and jumped on the game. Since I was a little girl still I was blown away by the game, honestly. All these shiny cars, so many posibilities how to tune up your car, I could even "own" girls. It was simply awesome for me. I could say that I played some solid 100 hours on it. I wanted 100% progress no matter what.\nAnd here I am after 7 years. I got it with a bundle for 0,99$. Bargain for a game I used to love so much.\nYou know how sometimes people tell you to not expect much from things you used to love so much and you come back to them? Yeah, there is a good reason for that.\nWhen I first started the game after so long I already noticed that this game is pretty cringy. The music is simply horrible, let's be honest. I had to turn it off after some while and just play my own music over it. Only listenable track is "Madhouse". I mean, yeah I get it there wasn't much cash left for a decent music, but gosh, you could slap some better music over it that wasn't that bad. Nevermind!\nAlso the gameplay is pretty easy. It isn't really hard to get on the top with a car you got as a starter. I am not trying to say you will finish the whole game with just Subaru Impreza but yeah, you will surive with that car untill you save for that Nissan Skyline loved by everyone (This game made me fall in love with that car even tho I know batshit about cars...).\nAnyways, the graphics are acceptable. Always could be better tho. I don't like comparing two completely different games but look at Half life 2 and graphics of this game! Nevermind, let's keep on rolling.\nOverall this game is still playable and I must admit I do enjoy it even after all these years but it isn't what it used to be.\nEven after this all it will still stay in my heart <3\n\nA review brought to you by Elle who doesn't even know how to "review" games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rallymen007/recommended/292410/","rallymen007","rally","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rallymen007/","832 products in account","Not a bad street racing game. Gameplay is solid, perhaps a notch ahead of what the NFS games from this era gave us. The handling model is a bit grippy but the car behaves well, paying for repairs or a new bottle of NOS are nice touches. Even though winning Arcade Mode, something doable if you're not uttery useless at driving, will give you a slightly overpowered car\n\nBut overall, the game lacks in content. There are 50 unique cars, but the game has the Gran Turismo syndrome, which means you get 6 Eclipses, 6 Skylines, 6 Celicas, 5 Supras, 5 350Z, 4 Imprezas, 4 RX-7s, 3 Jettas, 2 RX-8s, 2 Golfs, 2 IS200s, 2 Evos, 2 MR-2s and a lonely AE86.  The races take place on 3 different maps (LA, Miami and Philadelphia) but not only are the maps tiny, you can only freeroam in LA. Not that you will want to do that, as the cops are always watching you (sometimes engaging pursuit as soon as you leave an event -- or when speeding), you will have to pay for repairs and there's no GPS to guide you to any event. Freeroaming is more annoying than engaging.\n\n"Girlfriends", another selling point of game, are useless. Unless you enjoy heavily dithered low res pictures of not particularly good looking asian women, 240p videos of them dancing at really, really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ songs and insultingly low quality models of them doing the start routine thing in street races. Instead of spending budget on paying the girls, paying artists to model them, paying photographs to take all the pictures and paying the music they dance to, the devs should have focused on more actual content. At least the challenges they give you are fun to play through.\n\nWhich brings us on to graphics and audio. The game is old, and the graphics clearly show their age, but it's not too shocking. You get 2003-like shine on everything, bad sun sprites blocking the view and blank interiors but it's holding up rather nicely. Apart from the character models. They aged like milk. Engines sound like drones, the rolling sound from the tires is a bit too pronounced (unless that was the sound from the engine, I can't really tell) and the music is really, really bad. "I muted it in less than 5 minutes" levels of bad.","June 22, 2015","true","13.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","4","5","3","2"

This game came out 10 years ago and i was 10 years old at the time and i remember this game being 1 of the street racing games that i loved on the PS2. I remember renting it at blockbuster when it was still around. Anything with cars, modding cars, and neon lights under the cars i wanted it! I didnt even think twice about the price when i saw it on steam about 2 days ago and i immediately bought it with no hesitation lol. If you are a fan of what used to be the best street racing games that were made then you should get this and if you were a fan of it when it came out then its a must have!

Played it as a kid, was very fun to come back to. To those who enjoyed Underground 2, this is the closest any Steam game will ever get.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed my playthrough, keep note of these downsides:\n\nIt's not very realistic - the handling is acrade-style. The fact that you can drop $28k on upgrades and get a 900+ hp Skyline that goes from 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds doesn't add much realism either.\n\nThe progression is generally too fast, the game is beat in 5 to 6 hours. 1 hour into it I already had a 450 hp Impreza, which was heavily overpowered compared to other cars. In general, opponent's cars are way too slow in comparison and time trial events give way too much time, making the game very easy.\n\nThe soundtrack is not big enough and same songs are heard over and over again. The city is also small and easily remmemberable even after 6 hours playtime.\n\nEven with those issues, the game is great to play through. Completely worth the 5 dollars I paid on release (50% off)\n\nMake sure to get a widescreen fix if you get this game - playing at 4:3 with black bars is not very enjoyable.","April 25, 2014","true","6.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Unfortunately the police chases I've had so far have been pretty basic.  Turn a corner and they lose you.\n\nThe real focus of the game are the races and they feel great.  If you like old-school Need For Speed you will like this.  Unlike Need for Speed, car repair costs money.  Pulling off perfect corner drifts, riding on two wheels or other tricks will replenish a portion of your nitro.  I don't know if car damage is merely superficial or if it effects how your car handles.  I've only played it for an hour so far.\n\nIn addition to collecting cars you also collect "girlfriends."  Once you have won their affections by completing their challenge, you can choose to have them ride with you.  Unfortunately they do not speak to you as you ride.  Maybe she is just sitting there looking at her phone the whole time.  Women.  You can also unlock video clips of the girls dancing or whatever.  Very cheesy.  It doesn't let you stuff dollars in their clothing or anything.  This aspect of the game is unique but only half-cooked.\n\nAnyway, I got it on sale for $1 and it was well worth the price.  I would even recommend it at full price.

Reminds me of the Illegal street ricing games of yore, mostly because it IS one of those games. Be warned though, the PC port is jankey, and you will need to do wierd stuff to get widescreen to work.\n\nAlso the in game music is HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. "Ok, so it's not exactly Halo/GTA IV/NMRIH/Hotline Miami/Sonic levels of quality, so what?". Well, if you like 10 C-list gangsta rap songs from 13 years ago, then by all means leave your speakers on and enjoy the music. I ran for the music volume in the menu as fast as a I could. Just consider this a "bring your own music" game. I recomend Kavinsky, Boards of Canada, Mitch Murder, Aphex Twin, Lazerhawk, Carpenter Brut, M-O-O-N, Perturbator... umm, you get the idea. New Retro Wave Hipster music. NOT THE IN GAME MUSIC.\n\nAnyway, what the heck are you doing in this game anyway? Rather simple, You start out in typical fashion winning a bunch of money in a  random race in somone elses car, then you have $30,000 to spend on a car. Bet your money and win more stuff.

But sadly the game had not aged too well in my opinion and is not worth the ten dollar price tag. The game is often compaired to NFS and sadly I just don't see it. NFS: Underground, which game out around the same time, has aged quite well and is still a blast to play today. It's okay if you have a nostolgic factor with the game, but new players to the game will likely bore of it.\n\nPros:\n+Looks great for a 2005 PC game.\n+Has an interesting-ish hub world.\n+Cutsceens are the best comedy ever.\n\nCons:\n-Controlls are ♥♥♥♥.\n-Horrible menu navigation.\n-AI are either too stupid or too MLG.\n-The game in general has not aged well.\n\nWith this being said, I cannot fully and wholeheartly recommend this game.

It's not a bad game really, especially if it's in your childhood memories from a decade ago. I never owned this game on PS2, but I have played it a couple of times when I was a kid. Yesterday I got a key from Indiegala, and it was worth it, since I didn't have to pay for it. But would I pay for it? Not really. Yes, there is the nostalgic feeling, there is the customisation, but the physics are utter garbage! The way that the cars corner is terrible, They understeer as if they had bicycle wheens installed on the front. At least that was the case with my starter car (Subaru "Bugeye" Impreza RS) On the racing series in the storm drain, there were parts of the track where I couldn't see a bloody thing because the sun was blocking my vision and the other drivers passed me every time, and since I couldn't restart the race, losing was the only option, apart from shutting the game down in Task Manager.\n\nSo, what I have to say about this game is, is it fun? Yes. Does it make you want to play it for some time and progress within the game? Yes. Is it worth the money? Only with discounts or like me, you got it for free in a giveaway.","January 21","false","3.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I would recommend Ignite over this garbage. No wonder it got mediocre reviews back in the day.\n\n-FR cars are too common, and they spin out very easily. Sometimes just turning.\n-Every single race is a 3 race series instead. Not only do you need to pay cash, you also need to have impressed enough people to get in. 2 forms of currency to race in a racing game. And not enough ways to earn Respect Points.\n-The final series is locked behind a grand total of 77,000 Respect Points. That's nearly every series done perfectly. 250 points sounds easy, especially when you max out a Skyline... But consider the following: Every single race except for "Nitro Xtreme" will only get you to about 75,000 points. With all 18 girlfriends unlocked, too. This means to unlock the final series, you need to have completed the previous 6 races almost flawlessly. Which is damn near impossible.\n\n2/10. Tops. And I'm being generous.

If you want stuff with local multi-player action, get it . You can go split screen or LAN . The presets for an Xbox 360 controller are a bit goofy, but you can change those . (You'll have to use controller 1 to set up controller 2 in that goofy menu) . Take some personal time with this game to tweek out the goofyness before you bring your laptop over to your buddy's place . I noticed that on the split screen, you can only hear the enjine and tires of car #1, unless car #2 is rather close . Both cars also have to finish a split screen race to end the program .

In my view, the pros are greater that the cons, so that's why this is comming with a thumbs up.\n\nIn summary, SRS is a 2004 race game (this steam version was released in 2005) that features an underground import racing scene, on which the player's main objective is to gain respect on the streets and affection of various females in the city.\n\n+ This game has a killer idea of gameplay, in which you have 3 types of racing: 1. Crew Meets, 2. Street Challenges and 3. Random Encounter. In Crew Meets, you have 3 pre-requisites to meet in order to enter a racing series: Respect Amount, Ante Cash (to build the final prize) and the car horsepower. When these are attended, you may enter the series of 3 races. Before each one of these races, you decide whether to place or not a reserved bet on a specific racer to boost your money earnings. These bets are per race and not related to the total prize made by the ante cash of the 4 racers. The others two types are similar and simpler. To compete in them, you need the cash the rival is willing to bet. The higher his car specs are compared to yours, higher is the amount of cash required to race (for instance, if its a skyline versus a skyline, the bet is x thousand, but if it's a skyline versus a celica, the wager would go up to 3x thousand). The difference between 2 and 3 race types is in the way you trigger them. While 2 is in a specific spot within the map, 3 is triggered when you eventually find a racer in free roam and you flash your headlights at the rear of his car. The customization options require effort in tunning because all can be bought and installed in your car since the very beggining; you only need the cash to get it. But that is not probably the best idea bacause equipping your car with all that can be purchased may overpower the car, rendering it uncontrolable, easy to crash and slower than the competition as it burns tires for a quarter mile at the slightest touch on the throttle. A balanced car is needed to raise the win rate and finding the thereshold for power/control in each car is different and very rewarding for those who like motorsports (as myself). "But where is the killer part in the gameplay until now?" "All this I have seen in other racing games blabla..." Now just imagine all this I have said with these aspects: SRS features a car damage model that forces the player to drive carefully. Heavy damage impacts car performance and heavy repairs cost money to the player. Depending on the price of the car and the amount of destruction, fixing the ride will drain the most (if not all or even more than) of the earnings from their last race. All of this with no restart feature! That's right people NO RESTART! If you lose a race, you will lose the money and your girlfriend - if you had any riding with you - and that is genious. Weaklings don't survive on this hardcore simulation of life game, and I say that because in life you have only 1 shot at pretty much everything, and this games does just that, and it does beautifully, unlike any other from any other genre.\n\n- For the weak spots, I will state the lack of polish and a deeper care for the excellent idea the game promotes. The game has a fair amount of cars and customization options (given the limitations of the platforms originally intended to run this game) but the carrer mode is very short and generic. There are only a handful of short cutscenes to give the player a feedback on the overall progress and the story itself is a little out of place. The driving feels different for each car as they have different wheel drive configurations, weight and engineering, but that isn't very convincing in this game. The physics lack trimming to convince the player the car is actually going through the surface, the graphics are dated and the city plays static and dead. In some regions is always night time and in others always day, the police A.I. is abnormally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you can count in your fingers the people found on the streets and sidewalks on the hole district.\n\nWith these comments stated, I finish this review giving a score of 8.5/10 to this game. I know the game looks dull, unfinshed and unpolished, but my score is this high because of the concepts this game offers. The removal of the restart feature makes you enjoy and live trough every corner of the game, and crashing makes you rage just like if you did in a real car. You know it can't be undone and it's going to cost a lot. With 14 hours of gameplay on this steam version and hundreds more in the XBOX version, I can safely assure you, seen that I have experienced countless other racing games from before and after SRS time, that this game is the best at it's genre, and I strongly recommend it to virtual racing and car tuning lovers just like myself.","January 6, 2015","true","24.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","5"

No waypoints show up when you pull up map. No easy way to find garage or see where any certain challenges are. Doesn't show/tell you what most of the upgrades you do will do to your car. Doesn't explain respect besides being entry for newer races which seems kind of grindy and not very needed. Also limited controller support and many times while clicking on options with mouse it would not work, such as one time when I clicked "no" to race with mouse and it clicked yes for me. Remapping works for some gamepad controllers but not others. Midnight club and NFS underground both more worthwhile.

Is it worth the $10 USD price tag?! HELL NO but is it worth picking up on sale or even for free? ♥♥♥♥ING YES! I'll be honest something everyone seems to miss which is totally a game breaker is the ♥♥♥♥ing resolution there is no working fix to find... unless you're happy with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ resolutions that can't even go passed 1280 x 720p then have fun but if you can't then stay away stay far far far away because you will be sad after getting a taste of the game.\n\nThere is plenty of things right with this game number one thing being is well it's a 2005 era midnight racing game... WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ DOESN'T LIKE THAT! Choc full of tuners and ricer cars... mhm a ricers wet dream! You name a car from those years it's mostly likely in here... RX7, R34, 350Z, WRX (Bug Eye), Eclipse etc. It's corny as ♥♥♥♥ in a good way, it has free roam with cop chases and all... I mean the cops actually chase you if you speed passed them! Modifications to cars is great while not as awesome as Need for Speed Underground 1 & 2, it is indeed still awesome it's more in line with the Juiced car racing series than anything else. Full engine tuning, NOS, neons, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vinyls, decals and paint... enough to get a ricer horny. THE GAME IS FULL OF ♥♥♥♥ING PORNSTARS OR SOMESHIT... whether or not you like that ♥♥♥♥ is up to you and the music is mostly good but sometimes a hit or miss!\n\nI get it it's a 2005 game I gotta except dumb ♥♥♥♥ing problems but seriously come on I wasn't excepting to put up with ♥♥♥♥ poor resolutions... theses resolutions make my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ look better. If you are gonna re release a game at least try to up rez things I don't care if the ui/hud is stretched at least I can look at the game properly. OH and instead of adding more ♥♥♥♥ing cars they decided it's a great idea to have 4 versions or the same damn car LIKE WHY... WHY IS THAT A THING? There are ♥♥♥♥ing mod shops for a reason... poor excuse to say it has more "content" then it really does.\n\nHonestly it's a damn great game and it's fun but I simply cannot recommend it because of the ♥♥♥♥ poor resolutions... unless you can put up with it. I seriously do not recommend it... but for free I can let it slide, I mean hell for that grab a stick and poke it give it a shot but seriously anything over $1 USD just stay the ♥♥♥♥ away!","January 24","false","2.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","3","9","2","1"

The controls are stiff with a keyboard, ai cars are super controlled no matter how fast they go yet if you go to a certain speed you spin out constantly. avoid rear wheel drive cars, they spin out anywhere from 50mph and above. oh and it does not matter how many meets you beat, if your respect is high, street challenges get severely high even if your car is not up for it. In other words another winner from the ps2 with bad controls and a crap setting.....the sound track is like 4 wierdly censored songs. Oh and if you think there is a good variety of vehicles you are dead wrong. most of the "other" cars are merely the same damn car with a different kit.

I got it for 3 reasons.\n1. I loved NFS Underground 2 and thought this might be similar.\n2.  I want to recreate the anime Initial D, cos this game has a Trueno.\n3. The girls are hot.\n\nMy reasons for getting this game might be silly, but its hard for me not to judge it based of merit alone cos i don't play racing games. So heres whats good about it.\nIt takes place at night. Which is awesome. The world is not bad. The racing is decent. The Gf system might be cheesy, but it is nice. Thats ir.\nWhat i hate the most about this game are the mechanics that have nothing to do with racing. You cannot quit a race without loosing. If you loose you  cannot restart the match. Most races require an entry fee and you can run out of cash if you have to quit a number of races. No money no real races. Also money is used to fix your car, which gets damaged fast. Damage CANNOT be turned off. The story is also lame for the most part. The music is annoying. Also there is no sense of proper progression which can be argued on whether thats a good thing or not. Also without a test track and just a ton of money, you will end up buyying upgrades you may not have needed. How hard was it really to put a practice track in this game. Seriously, after the first race, you buy your fist car, and upgrade it to start actually playing.\nSo if you are a racing game enthusiast, you might like this. If you are casual, the girls really aren't enough to keep you playing this game, even though they are really attractive.\n\nNote - If you are visually impared, you can try this, but cos of the open world nature its really easy to go of the course completey, seeing as how nothing is really walled off. Because it takes place at night it is easier to see the turns, but it really depends on the speed at which your eyes proccess whats going on. Also the motion blur and bloom effects are horrible and distort your vision badly rather than enhance the asthetics. If you are looking for a simple fun racer just go with NFS underground 2. Also the resolution is pretty old school so text is at least easier to read.","November 22, 2014","false","3.7"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","2"

If you're wondering\n\nPretty poor car selection too. You've got different variants of the same car but bottom line is, it's still the same car.\n\nControls are pretty crap. Manual transmission is utter rubbish, it doesn't seem to shift when you want it to. It does up fine, but ask it to shift down and it takes it's own sweet time when if finally decides to accept the command. You also can't change controls in the middle of a race or event, you can change it but the game doesn't register the change.\n\nPhysics is sorta a mix of Juiced and NFS. It can be tricky at times but is generally easy to use and learn.\n\nGameplay experience is largely ruined by the crap sounds. It seems that the game cannot overlay the sounds properly and just chooses one to play together with the BGM.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this game unless you absoloutely had to buy a racing game to play with the keyboard.","July 6, 2014","false","5.4"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

The logo of the game looks really cool. Unfortunately the coolness of this game ends there. I didn't play much of the game, because I couldn't torture myself for so long. The game is filled with awfulness.\n\nFirst thing that ruined the gaming mood was the music. Devs couldn't afford to buy a better music I guess. If somebody would listen to any of the SRS's soundtrack in real life would mean they have absolutely zero music taste. In 30 minutes of game play I heard 1 song about 4 times. Does that mean there's only 5 songs in the game?\n\nThe other thing is one of the maps was in the water channel. What could possible go wrong? Why are the plastic protective barriers there? Does it mean that it was specifically build not for the water but for cars? And who the hell would put a big TV screen there for nobody to see? Maps and the environment were not thought through properly.\n\nThe developers went further and actually decided not to check for any reference of car crashes. Ugly as hell damage to cars makes you vomit. If it was so bloody ugly why would they even implement it, because I couldn't see if it was even affecting controls.\n\nI was looking at the car, and I am kinda fine with the whole squareness of it. But the triangle wheel arch just put me off so much. Unrealistic glass shader. I actually doubt it has one, as I think all the models were just painted.\n\nIn the world, there's one light that is coming from underneath the surface and casting a shadow of you car on other objects. That's just... Other lights are baked and don't cast any shadows at all. And worst of all – the Sun. Its so huge and bright that it blinds you. As long as your camera is looking at the direction of the sun you are done for. Of course it makes zero difference for AI.\n\nI don't know who thinks that the woman in this game are hot. I find the really... old? One of them looks like my mates mother. That is not to mention that in 2004 the fashion wasn't so ugly. They look like they are straight from 90s. And why are they so skinny? Why cant this game follow NFSU2 and get a good looking porn star? I am sure its not that expensive to do one photo shoot.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to anybody. Just spend money on any other old or new racing game.","July 5, 2014","false","2.1"," 7 of 25 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","7","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darezeleon/recommended/292410/","darezeleon","DareZeleon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darezeleon/","47 products in account","Ah, SRS, an oldie, and to some, a goodie as well!\n\nStreet Racing Syndicate has been out for about 11 years now, and taking in perspective of the times since then, in all honestly, this game hasn't aged as well as those who've played the game years ago would hope. But that doesn't mean it's no longer a good game.\n\nI first played this game around the time it was new for the PS2, and the main things about this game that I wanted to experience again for the PC, several years later have you, was the feel of being in the import racing scene. It's not as immersive or as replayable as let's say Need for Speed: Undergound 2, but for those who are playing it for the first time, it'll likely keep you occupied for quite some time before you move on to the next game. The only real thing that stood out to me in this game (aside from the women, of course!) was how you can wager money with other racers, and with no restarts, you either win, or lose. And winning is just as beneficial to your career progression as losing is harmful, mostly because you'll be low on cash. But other than wagering and entering race series in the game, the only real use of money is to buy new cars and upgrade them.\n\nThat's probably the best part of the game: the car customization. Although the car selection isn't bad (some good cars and variations of the cars are nice, but there's not much variety in cars in general to choose from), when you do go to the garage, you're welcomed with performance upgrades, visual (cosmetic) upgrades, the dyno, and repairing your car if it's damaged. Which, of course, costs money as well, but a broken car doesn't hinder your car's performance. You have a good amount of options to choose from, though if car customization is what you're after, you're better off with Need for Speed Underground 2. Taking away the comparison of the two games, it's definitely an aspect of SRS that I enjoy, sometimes more than actually driving the car.\n\nLet's not forget to mention, there's cops in the Free Roam of Street Mode (career mode basically)!  The Arcade Mode is fun as well, and you can unlock cars for completing Iron Man and Checkpoint challenges in that mode for Street Mode. And yes, they're customized and ready to be driven as soon as you unlock them! I haven't touched Multiplayer, but I definitely wouldn't recommend getting this game hoping it still works.\n\nHere's where the downfalls come in. First off, the game is slow. I'm not talking about the game's progress is slow. No, when you're driving fast, it feels slow. Even with motion blur it feels as if going 180 mph is about the same as going 90 mph. I'm not exaggerating either. It's the main reason why racing feels less exciting than the other racing games of its time. Let's not even compare it to the newer games. Another downfall is the game's graphics. Sure, not bad for its time, but the textures is the only real downside to it. Frame rate is fine, and even View Replays look nice when they're focused on your car most of the time. This is with the highest settings too. There's also the physics of the game, not the best, not the worst, but the tuning options for each car in the game are there to make the physics more bearable. What car customization won't fix is how much respect points you need to move forward into the career mode. Once you get stuck, it a pain to go back and re-do events to get more respect points, even if you have some of the fastest cars and alot of girlfriends in the game.\n\nThe sounds in this game is a split, for me, at least. The cars and the environment sound nice, when they're not chopped up (that's an issue I had as well as a video I saw, could just be on my end though). The music, however, gets repetitive, and eventually it's best to turn it off, or play your own music on the side. The soundtrack isn't the best either, maybe one or two good tracks, but that's about it.\n\nOverall, Street Racing Syndicate is a game to try out for it's price. It definitely won't feel like a waste of $10 (I heard it was 99 cents at one point, but it was $10 when I purchased it). You'll be able to enjoy what the game has to offer, but that's about it, really. The slow pace of the game and the narrow options of cars to choose from is part of what makes this game feel outdated, even for its time it wasn't considered any of the best games out there of the import tuner racing genre. If you've played this game before, it's a nice nostalgia ride.\n\n-K9_Rage/DareZeleon","May 28, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

SRS feels like a watered-down version of NFS Carbon (in the open world and impromptu races) and Underground (in the hot women starting the races and in the customization). I say "watered down" because it fails to accomplish what either of those NFS games did.\n\nThe graphics are unfortunately a product of the game's time. 2004 doesn't look so good in 2015, and the max resolution (which I can't even remember right now) is too low for today's standards. Thankfully, though, they didn't tax my computer like a lot of old games do for some reason, so at least there's that. And the cars look relatively nice compared to the scenery. Character models and cutscenes are horrible, though.\n\nGameplay shouldn't be too difficult - it's a racing game. Speed up, slow down, switch gears, get the position and win the thing. The nitrous works odd here, though; instead of having a limited supply that replenishes, you have a large supply that doesn't replenish. The handling also seems a little off than typical, cars are really floaty at times. Performance upgrades might change that, but the menu UI isn't exactly intuitive enough for me to tell which upgrades are actually good and which aren't. On the topic of menu UI, the entire game UI is really dated and uses odd keys like spacebar for some selections. Controller support is limited - it works, but you can't rebind all keys, and the UI doesn't show any controller buttons.\n\nMusic and sound effects are meh. That's all I have to say about them.\n\nIf you're looking for a good racing game, get a PS2 (or emulator) and one of the older NFS games. Underground, Underground 2, Most Wanted, and Carbon are very good ones, the latter two being much better than SRS in every way.","May 26, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darezeleon/recommended/292410/","darezeleon","DareZeleon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darezeleon/","47 products in account","Ah, SRS, an oldie, and to some, a goodie as well!\n\nStreet Racing Syndicate has been out for about 11 years now, and taking in perspective of the times since then, in all honestly, this game hasn't aged as well as those who've played the game years ago would hope. But that doesn't mean it's no longer a good game.\n\nI first played this game around the time it was new for the PS2, and the main things about this game that I wanted to experience again for the PC, several years later have you, was the feel of being in the import racing scene. It's not as immersive or as replayable as let's say Need for Speed: Undergound 2, but for those who are playing it for the first time, it'll likely keep you occupied for quite some time before you move on to the next game. The only real thing that stood out to me in this game (aside from the women, of course!) was how you can wager money with other racers, and with no restarts, you either win, or lose. And winning is just as beneficial to your career progression as losing is harmful, mostly because you'll be low on cash. But other than wagering and entering race series in the game, the only real use of money is to buy new cars and upgrade them.\n\nThat's probably the best part of the game: the car customization. Although the car selection isn't bad (some good cars and variations of the cars are nice, but there's not much variety in cars in general to choose from), when you do go to the garage, you're welcomed with performance upgrades, visual (cosmetic) upgrades, the dyno, and repairing your car if it's damaged. Which, of course, costs money as well, but a broken car doesn't hinder your car's performance. You have a good amount of options to choose from, though if car customization is what you're after, you're better off with Need for Speed Underground 2. Taking away the comparison of the two games, it's definitely an aspect of SRS that I enjoy, sometimes more than actually driving the car.\n\nLet's not forget to mention, there's cops in the Free Roam of Street Mode (career mode basically)!  The Arcade Mode is fun as well, and you can unlock cars for completing Iron Man and Checkpoint challenges in that mode for Street Mode. And yes, they're customized and ready to be driven as soon as you unlock them! I haven't touched Multiplayer, but I definitely wouldn't recommend getting this game hoping it still works.\n\nHere's where the downfalls come in. First off, the game is slow. I'm not talking about the game's progress is slow. No, when you're driving fast, it feels slow. Even with motion blur it feels as if going 180 mph is about the same as going 90 mph. I'm not exaggerating either. It's the main reason why racing feels less exciting than the other racing games of its time. Let's not even compare it to the newer games. Another downfall is the game's graphics. Sure, not bad for its time, but the textures is the only real downside to it. Frame rate is fine, and even View Replays look nice when they're focused on your car most of the time. This is with the highest settings too. There's also the physics of the game, not the best, not the worst, but the tuning options for each car in the game are there to make the physics more bearable. What car customization won't fix is how much respect points you need to move forward into the career mode. Once you get stuck, it a pain to go back and re-do events to get more respect points, even if you have some of the fastest cars and alot of girlfriends in the game.\n\nThe sounds in this game is a split, for me, at least. The cars and the environment sound nice, when they're not chopped up (that's an issue I had as well as a video I saw, could just be on my end though). The music, however, gets repetitive, and eventually it's best to turn it off, or play your own music on the side. The soundtrack isn't the best either, maybe one or two good tracks, but that's about it.\n\nOverall, Street Racing Syndicate is a game to try out for it's price. It definitely won't feel like a waste of $10 (I heard it was 99 cents at one point, but it was $10 when I purchased it). You'll be able to enjoy what the game has to offer, but that's about it, really. The slow pace of the game and the narrow options of cars to choose from is part of what makes this game feel outdated, even for its time it wasn't considered any of the best games out there of the import tuner racing genre. If you've played this game before, it's a nice nostalgia ride.\n\n-K9_Rage/DareZeleon","May 28, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

SRS feels like a watered-down version of NFS Carbon (in the open world and impromptu races) and Underground (in the hot women starting the races and in the customization). I say "watered down" because it fails to accomplish what either of those NFS games did.\n\nThe graphics are unfortunately a product of the game's time. 2004 doesn't look so good in 2015, and the max resolution (which I can't even remember right now) is too low for today's standards. Thankfully, though, they didn't tax my computer like a lot of old games do for some reason, so at least there's that. And the cars look relatively nice compared to the scenery. Character models and cutscenes are horrible, though.\n\nGameplay shouldn't be too difficult - it's a racing game. Speed up, slow down, switch gears, get the position and win the thing. The nitrous works odd here, though; instead of having a limited supply that replenishes, you have a large supply that doesn't replenish. The handling also seems a little off than typical, cars are really floaty at times. Performance upgrades might change that, but the menu UI isn't exactly intuitive enough for me to tell which upgrades are actually good and which aren't. On the topic of menu UI, the entire game UI is really dated and uses odd keys like spacebar for some selections. Controller support is limited - it works, but you can't rebind all keys, and the UI doesn't show any controller buttons.\n\nMusic and sound effects are meh. That's all I have to say about them.\n\nIf you're looking for a good racing game, get a PS2 (or emulator) and one of the older NFS games. Underground, Underground 2, Most Wanted, and Carbon are very good ones, the latter two being much better than SRS in every way.","May 26, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Although there are only several car manufactures, there are a handful of models that you can pick from granted that you have them unlocked. SRS also makes up for its lack of cars in the amount of customization that is offered for each. As far as racing goes, the game handles very smoothly and the AI are relatively easy to race against. Being that this game was realized in 2005, the graphics are not the best but certainly are not the worst either. However the sound quality could be better as it bugs out pretty often, but the music makes it so that it’s not really noticeable.\n\nIn conclusion the game is pretty decent for when it was made and for the price. Another cool thing to note for those who like crafting badges, is that you can unlock trading cards for this game. Lastly If you like old style arcade racing games, or are looking for a fun and cheap game to pass time with you should definitely give this one a chance.\n","February 2","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The customization part is pretty good, you have enough variety to tune a lot of cars without using the same stuff more than once.\n\nThe AI is easy for a racing veteran but defenitly ok for beginners. The game does not feel like its punishing you for every little mistake.\n\nI'd recommend this game for everyone who wants to enjoy an old racing game where you can tune cars and enjoy some good music. It's a good game to start your racing career - probably also a very good game for our younger members of the gaming community.","January 27","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
