"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nullpointerx/recommended/32440/","nullpointerx","nullPointer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nullpointerx/","467 products in account","As the title indicates, LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga is an amalgamation of two earlier games, LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game and Lego Star Wars II: The Original Saga.  I'm calling this an amalgamation as opposed to a compilation due to the fact that the gameplay is presented as a single uninterrupted experience, rather than as two that are separate and distinct.  Traveler's Tales has also added some additional content that was not present in either of the earlier stand-alone games.\n\nLEGO Star Wars: The Video Game was the very first LEGO game developed by Traveler's Tales (henceforth referred to as TT), whereas the Original Saga was the second title they developed under the LEGO banner.  These titles form the foundation of what are now familiar gameplay features found in nearly all subsequently developed LEGO games.  The hallmark sense of humor is here (although like all of the earlier TT LEGO games, there is no spoken dialog), as are the simple LEGO building puzzle elements.  We find a familiar hub based level structure with each level branching from that central hub, and of course the LEGO collect-a-thon aspects make their debut here including the requisite stud collection, mini-kits, red bricks, golden bricks, etc.  So while a majority of the gameplay elements will be familiar to those who have previously dabbled in LEGO games, it's interesting nonetheless see the ways in which TT was still experimenting with their formula, solidifying what would become their trademark style.  This last bit is particularly interesting in the context of The Complete Saga, because you can see Traveler's Tales incorporating lessons learned and improving their games between the separate bookends of the Prequel Levels (featured in LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game), and the original trilogy levels (as featured in The Original Saga).  From a historical standpoint it's striking to see how quickly Traveler's Tales was able to deftly incorporate lessons learned from the first game and use them to improve the second game.  From a gameplay standpoint though, this creates a bit of dissonance.  Stylistically, the Original Saga is a much more robust game.  The levels are longer and more complex, the puzzles are generally more interesting, the graphical elements are improved upon, etc.  So while the levels in Complete Saga are presented seamlessly, in practice you will notice a very definitive division between the older (prequel) levels and the newer (original saga) levels.  Speaking as a bit of a Star Wars nerd I'm happy that the Original Saga levels are the ones with better gameplay.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the gameplay elements here will be very familiar to anyone who has played TT LEGO games before.  Given the ubiquitous nature of these games, you probably already know whether this game is for you.  If you love the LEGO formula you'll find a lot to love here.  If the 'break everything in sight collect-a-thon' turns you off, well … these aren't the droids you're looking for.  <groan>  As I mentioned earlier, TT was still developing their trademark style in these games, so even those who have enjoyed more recent LEGO titles might find some of the elements featured here to be a bit rudimentary.  The controls are (naturally) very familiar, but at the same time feel slightly 'looser' than later LEGO titles.  Switching between characters can be a bit tedious since TT had yet to develop the character wheel system seen in more recent titles.  This means that you need to stand directly next to the character you wish to switch to, and since you often have several characters crowding in on you this can lead to several instances of switching to the wrong character.  This can be slightly rage inducing when you're under attack.  Speaking of computer controlled characters, they are basically useless while not under your direct control, and even worse you may find many circumstances in which they will actively become a hindrance.  There were several circumstances in which I would need to destroy one of my computer controlled allies simply to create a clear line of fire.  Get the heck out of the way Chewie!  And while I'm on this topic, I won't lie, sometimes I would randomly just lay a beat down on Jar-Jar, because … Jar-Jar.\n\nI need to make special mention of the collectible elements in this game, because that aspect has really been dialed to eleven.  If you're like me and you like to unlock everything these games have to offer, well … you're going to be here a while.  You'll need to play through every level no less than four times.  You'll play a level once in story mode which will unlock free play mode.  Then you'll need to play through free play mode to clean up any of the standard remaining goals in that level.  Once you've completely finished the episode you'll unlock Challenge and Super Story modes.  So you'll play each level again in Challenge mode to retrieve the blue mini-kits, and lastly you'll play through them yet again in Super Story mode which is a time-based score attack and simply adds to your completion percentage.  Four times for every level.  Once you couple this with the fact that this game features unskippable cut scenes, it can all start to become a bit … tedious.  As I mentioned, this part really only applies to completionists, so your mileage may vary significantly in this regard.  I think this is another area in which TT was still figuring out the formula, which in this case meant finding an acceptable line between "collect a bunch of unlockables" and "OMFG, will it ever end!?"\n\nThe story is … well, if you don't know it by now, you should schedule yourself for a Star Wars movie marathon, stat.  Having said that, you don't need to be a Star Wars scholar to appreciate the game for what it is.  In point of fact it can be a great introduction to the Star Wars universe for young padawan Star Wars fans looking to get a toehold on the series.  It keeps everything fairly light and deftly negotiates some of the darker aspects of the story.  It's also a great game to play co-op with young ones.  The game treats its subject matter with great reverence and humor.  As a Star Wars fan I enjoyed the game from beginning to end, and this game easily fits within the upper echelons of the greatest Start Wars games ever released.  There are six levels devoted to each movie within the Star Wars saga, and among them you will find all the standard Star Wars set pieces you might expect in a game of this nature along with some surprising gems.  The levels feature a mix of on-foot and piloted air/space craft missions.  All the missions are paced very well, and keep things moving along at a nice clip.  Furthermore the plethora of unlockable characters available keeps things fresh enough so that repeated playthroughs seldom feel stale.\n\nOverall the games presented here are highly enjoyable and well done.  Even in their first forays into LEGO games, TT was already onto a winning formula that would continue to be refined in later games.  This game gets my recommendation for fans of simple puzzle-based action adventure games appropriate for gamers both young and old, and especially for being a great co-op game.","July 29, 2015","true","74.0"," 416 of 434 people (96%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","96","416","434","42","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxic_fuel/recommended/32440/","toxic_fuel","Toxic Fuel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxic_fuel/","123 products in account","In my opinion, this LEGO game is one of the best ones I have ever played, and I've played almost every single LEGO game. Here's why I enjoyed it so much.\n\nFirst off, replay value. I have beaten this game twice on a Nintendo Wii I had, and now once here on PC. Since there are so many levels, collectables, funny cutscenes, and it staying very true to all six Star Wars movies, it really never gets old.\n\nWhich brings me to my second point. This game lasts for quite some time, especially if you are in it to collect everything. You'll have to play through every level (36 levels) about 2 or 3 times to get everything. Sounds tedious, right? Well, no. You see, once you have done story mode, like all other LEGO games, you can go back with any other characters and power on through the level. It's very fun to go back and explore the places you can't get to in story mode.\n\nSo now the third reason why this game is so fun. Throughout the game you can collect "Power Bricks" which enable you to do things like become invincible and make the in-game currency, the studs, worth many times their original value. This makes it so you can buy vehicles, characters, and other things faster. You can also make it so your Jedi Slam does more damage, disable enemy weapons, and so much more.\n\nAnd finally, the shear amount of characters is amazing. There are over 120 characters, some being different variations of the same person and lots of others. You can even be Indiana Jones! Being set in the Star Wars universe, it's only natural there would be plenty of characters to choose from, and this game doesn't disappoint.\n\nBut what are the levels like? They are all unique, providing different things to do in every level. However, a few levels are a bit repetitve and boring. One or two are extremely hard in story mode, such as one where you have to fly around and destroy enemy ships and weapons. But the rest of the levels certainly make up for them.\n\nWith this game having the replay value and normal LEGO humor, it's a fantastic game to play. I got halfway through the game about 17 hours in, so it's certainly not a short game, especially if you are a completionist like me and want to get to 100%. So if you have never played it and were wondering, I strongly recommend it! 9/10.","April 16, 2014","true","23.6"," 37 of 37 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","37","37","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maddyline/recommended/32440/","Maddyline","Combined Syndicates of America","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maddyline/","112 products in account","So this is Lego Star Wars - The Complete Saga, it's the sequel to Lego Star Wars II, which was in turn a Sequel to Lego Star Wars. If you've played this as a kid on the Ps2 like I have, you know what you're getting into, but regardless here's a review.\n\nThe Complete Saga features the 6 pre-force awakens episodes - the prequel era episodes through the original trilogy - and levels are based on scenes and events in the movies.\n\nSo the game starts you off in the first level of Episode 1, the Phantom Menace, in the Trade Federation blockade ship Episode 1 largely started in. You play as Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan and try to escape from the ship, the first level serving as a tutorial on how the functions of the game work, such as the force, building, studs, minikits, deflecting blaster shots, and access panels only characters can access.\n\nAfter you finish that level, you're free to go to any of the other episodes of the Prequels/OT. Which is rather nice and actually really well thought out, while you can continue with the plot of TPM, you're allowed to jump to any of the other episodes and start off at level 1. You don't have to complete all the levels of TPM to move on to AOTC, for example. The game is really open and free, and as such comes off as a really good title.\n\nThe gameplay is just what you would expect from a Lego game, it's fun, interactive, and runs great. Most props are composed of Legos in the game, with the exception of environments (Which still look good) and it gives the game and levels a great atmosphere that you expect from a Lego game.\n\nAs you go through the game, you can unlock more things with money, be it custom characters, cheats, or hints from the store. And can use the characters when replaying missions.\n\nMeanwhile, the explanation of the story in the game is arguably better than how it's explained in some of the films. This being an early Lego game,(since modern Lego games seem to have dialogue) there is no dialogue and thus the cutscenes explaining the story have to rely on only visuals to get the plot across, and it's honestly genius how they explain some of the Episode Plots. The cutscenes for the Phantom Menace Episode, for example, are not only more funny than the actual film it's based on, but the game's explanations of the story in the episode in the cutscenes more easily explain the plot of the film, and you're able to get a gist of what's going on. Which, in the case of TPM, where the conflict is based on a trade blockade dispute,(and honestly one of the most difficult plots to explain due to how messy it is for a Star Wars film) is very important for game cutscenes to be short and to the point, and this game is great at explaining stuff by way of 15 second cutscenes.\n\nThe game runs fantastically and I've yet to find a PC of mine that cannot run it, it's greatly optimized and allows for great customization of settings, including the controls. Though the mouse cannot be bound as a key, which confused me until I realized that the setup of the game is for it to be entirely played without a mouse, which is cool, but if you have a controller I suggest you use it for this.\n\nIf you're looking for online Multiplayer though, you won't find it here, the multiplayer service is local (i.e two people would have to share the PC screen) but I don't blame the game for this as the original game on the consoles was also local and without online multiplayer connection. Though if you want to set up Steam Big Picture and grab some remotes, it's probably possible to mimic a console.","January 7","true","43.7"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/32440/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Lego Star Wars the Complete Saga came out in 2009 on PC and combined together Lego Star Wars the Video Game (1-3 episodes) and Lego Star Wars the Original Trilogy (4-6 episodes). No, Lego Star Wars 3 on Steam is a compltely different game. Aside from combining, it also changed gameplay in vehicle chapters of 1-3 Episodes, as well as adding bonus chapters, which include original versions of those vehicle levels. And well, let's just say that Lego Star Wars was quite a sudden hit when original came out in 2005, developed by Traveller's Tales, who made few charming games in the past and now are making Legos non-stop. Also, PC version has no online multiplayer. No Lego games on PC do.\n\nTechnically it still works excellent. No glitches or crashes. Supports widescreen, as it should. It also works excellently with non-Xbox360 controllers, something that became quite rare nowadays.\n\nSo, what is Lego Star Wars? Let's just say that it's one of the most casual games in action genre. There is no such thing as "game over". You can't die, you have infinite lives. The only thing that you lose is "stud", the currency of the game. Instead the game forces on collecting, unlocking, sillyness, humor and collecting and collecting. You got over 120+ characters to unlock, for example. And in each chapter 10 minikits are hidden. And often you can't get them all in Story Mode, instead having to use Free Play where you can change character to one of the few specially selected. Even though there are a lot of useless character or the ones who do same stuff, have same powers. But hey, this is what you get when the game tries to appeal to Star Wars nerds, putting every single character from background into it, while also making them stay unique in Lego shape.\nGame wants you to unlock some characters and then come back to the levels, uncovering all the secrets. There is probably too much of stuff to collect.\n\nAnd I must say though that the game, due to it's relaxy nature, can get quite repetitive for more classic gamers. After all, you can't die, you immeditly respawn in same spot. Penalty on Stud isn't huge, and people who don't care about unlocking anything just will not care. As a result of this, playing through all 6 episodes will get so old, that you will want it to end ASAP by Episode 6. One of those cases where game is too long for it's own good.\nTalking about story, it's probably slightly friendly to those who didn't watch Star Wars itself. Sometimes not. There is text before each chapter but the cutscenes are silent, instead being just about parody. Probably great for those who watches films first.\nAnd I got to say that 4-6 Episodes somehow were more interesting in story part than 1-3. Didn't see movies myself. Maybe people who kick the prequels aren't so wrong.\n\nThe gameplay combines the action of fighting and puzzles in it, with some exploration for sake of gettin studs. Puzzles are quite varied. Sometimes you have to push a box. But most often it's about switching to the right character to open the door. Original trilogy got better there, making you take on a helmet to pass some doors. You don't have to get hit so the helmed will not get knocked off. Also, AI is pretty great there, as in cases where it requires 2 players, it will help you happily.\n\nNow, there is action, fighting part. You got either got a gun or lightsaber. Gun users can shoot with attack button. Some of them can avoid incoming shots if you press attack in a moment when the enemy laser shot is nearby. In such cases character will dodge and then aim at the one who shot it. So, spamming attack can win the battles there. Gun users can also use hooks to get into some areas.\nLightsaber users can once again smash button to hit things. Hitting attack when somebody is about to hit you also makes your character block, also deflecting any laser back at attacker, so panicing by mashing attack can work there too. But they can also double jump and do area attack this way. Actually, you fight most bosses with Lightsaber character and most often the way that you can do damage on them is just spamming jump attack.\n\nAnd well, such simplistic nature of fighting should compliment the game that is mostly about puzzles and exploration for sake of collecting. The thing is, there is at times way too much fighting. And it doesn't help at all that AI refuses to help you any bit, only sometimes distracting enemy attention on itself. You feel quite alone in these cases.\nActually it gets to completely frustrating moments by the end of a game. Like, after fighting a bunch of enemies, you just want to concentrate on puzzle solving to get into next area. But as you finally found that you have to move something with force, game decides that you spent your time too boring and spawns yet another bunch of Stormtroopers. By this time, you really don't want to fight them, because you know you will win by spamming attack button, you want to solve the darn puzzle already. And all of this while few AI characters stand dumbly around, doing nothing. If you try to do something with force, then suddenly every enemy will focus fire on you, so you sigh and just spend another 15 seconds on destroying them all.\n\nThere are also vehicle missions where you fly around, spamming attack, collecting purple balls in one spot and then unleashing them on purple target. Most of them are like that. You can also play original versions of vehicle chapters in bonus levels, and boy, looking at them, they were much harder than you would expect from such relaxed game.\n\nWell, and graphics and music. Graphics are nice and fits well. It's hard to claim that Lego figures look unrealistical and lack polygons you know. Though, it feels too bright or blurry at times.\nMusic is mostly same as in movies. I guess. It's either something forgetable, or arrangement of either Star Wars themes or Imperial March. Which is fine for movies. Not fine for games where you need more unique and memoriable tracks for each location. But hey, at least it changes between battle and peaciful music during gameplay.\n\nSo yea. if you got two kids who love Star Wars and like collecting things, while being silly to each other, then it's perfect game right there. There is a reason why they say it's a game fo their childhood. And if you want more of traditional gaming values in it, then well, only expect to be amused.","July 13, 2015","true","25.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Also every Episode has 6 levels + 2 bonus missions.\nTo get the Blue Minikit you must play Challenge Mode it's a fun addition.\n\nThe game is old so it's not perfect you can't depend on the AI to kill anyone for you and sometimes you have so many enemy's constantly respawning you can't do what you have to do.\n\nBut this game has allot of gametime and it allot of fun even if you don't know Star Wars like me.\nCharacters can fly, throw bombs, use lightsabers, use the force, jump extra high. open certain doors depending on who you use.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=608971228\n\nThe game has missions in which you can only do flying it's cool and you can unlock more vechiles, you will need a Tie Fighter to open certain doors for the Minikits.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=609198622\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=609697112\n\nBesides all of that the game has 6 bonus rooms you will be able to unlock with the Gold Bricks nothing special doh.\nAnd when you own all Bounty Hunter characters you can do the 15 Bounty Hunter missions.\n\nI do recommend this game, I finished it 97% and then I was done with it.\nOne of the few down things is that you can't skip Cinametics and to swap Characters you must stand near them but thats about the only bad stuff.\nShould do for about 30 hours if you follow that path.\nThe storyline is fun as Fan you will reconize stuff and if you are like me you will learn things.\nI learned theirs more then 1 version of R2D2 and C3PO.","February 2","true","40.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","1"

And to be honest, you would be pretty much right. But. Because there is a but (there always is). It was the first of this kind of lego game. Or, more precisely, it is the combination of the first two, the Lego Star Wars games (duh).\nTo those who played them separatly before, I say this : they took the first game, and got rid of what was infuriating to make it more diverse, like the second one is. And then they added the two games together, which means that you do not need to have a saved game of Lego Star Wars I to fight the Emperor with Jar-Jar and a young Boba Fett (I don't recommand trying that, btw).\nTo those who have played other Lego games, I say this : it is no open world. It is quite linear at first. And there is nothing original here : you play through the movies. But it is funny, it is easy to beat (you get through the missions in under 3 hours), and you will go through it many times if, like me, you are a completionist.\nTo those who have never played a Lego game, I warn you : if you happen to like this game, you might lose yourself in the Lego franchise. As I mentionned, it is quite easy to beat it "normally", that is to say finish the story mode. But that is when the real fun starts. You have much to unlock, discover, search... You can go back to any level to play it with unlocked characters, to look for secrets and secondary objectives. And that is without the bonus levels. Also : you see Vader show Luke a picture of him and Leia together to prove that they are related. Just saying.\nIn short, it is well worth the price. If you happen to have an Xbox controler, that is. It is dreadfull to play with a keyboard (no mouse allowed). You have been warned.","April 18","true","36.1"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","17","20","3","2"

Personally, I find the Star Wars flavor to be the best out of all of them, but for the same reason that a die-hard Harry Potter fan would tell you that the Harry Potter LEGO Games are the best.\n\nOverall, if you haven't ever played a LEGO game, then don't just buy the "latest and greatest".

The two versions are practically identical save for maybe a higher framerate on PC. If you fear that the PC version is any different then you need not worry because it is just as good and I look forward to 100% this game.\n\nLego Star Wars: The Complete Saga is the six star wars movies told in lego form. Each episode is split into six chapters, so there are 36 levels of lego silliness to enjoy. Each level has different objectives like collecting enough money in each level to get "true jedi," collecting ten minikits to make a vehicle to use in other levels, and the red brick that gives you abilities to purchase (with ingame money, as it should be). On top of this there is free play, that lets you have fun in each level instead of playing the story, and even other levels outside of the original saga like challenge modes. There's a "super story" that tests how fast you can complete the six chapters in an episode in succession. So in terms of gameplay there is a lot to do.\n\nLego Star Wars is definitley a completionists game, with things to collect wverywhere you go. There's minikits, red bricks, characters, true jedi, and lots of money. Your progress is tracked with a hologram by the shop in the hub world of Mos Eisley cantina. Even this cantina has loads of things to do like make custom characters, view ones you've unlocked, go outside the cantina and look at vehicles, and a two player challenge mode (everything in the game can be done with a local co-op partner).\n\nGiven that this game was released in 2009 the graphics are dated compared to the Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens game and others. There is also a lack of co-op over the internet.\n\nI would definitley recommend this game to people of all ages, people who like star wars, and completionists of all levels.","May 7","true","6.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Highest possible recommendation for casual gaming (or obsessive collecting).  I am not a big Star Wars Prequel fan, but their least-irritating form is, surprisingly, their Lego gaming depiction.  Who would have thought back in the 80's while we were struggling to beat "Contra" on NES with only 5 or so lives that our favorite games in the future would be ones in which you can't really "die" or "lose."  All of these Lego games are only frustrating when it comes to 3D platforming at times, when it's hard to guess what depth the platform you are aiming for exists at, but overall, this is a great, comprehensive, varied, fun game.  I have experienced zero bugs with it.","January 27, 2014","true","0.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Particularly if you're a completionist because finishing the game as-is will probably leave you at about 50% completion rate with plenty more to find in form of unlockable characters, gameplay gimmicks and additional levels.\n\nAs a game it's your action adventure fare with platforming as you go through the entire movie hexalogy. I have to point out the game does suffer from having vehicle levels with extremely loose controls that simply end up getting in the way of things, though. The Complete Saga even retroactively adds some vehicle sections to prequel episodes to keep the entire experience consistent. It does benefits from eschewing voice acting in favor of simple gesticulation which leads to a lot of funny scenes as characters try to convey some plot points. Speaking of characters they operate based on different types ranging from Jedi and Sith aka Force users to droids and bounty hunters, each with their own specific utility which you will need to use in order to complete each level to its fullest. In practice this means you'll be going back to already finished levels in order to complete them as you unlock more characters. You'll also be spending omnipresent studs you gather throughout the game as currency to unlock things.\n\nThis write-up may seem to be a bit all over place, but that's because I find myself fighting for words. It's a really great game and should not be dismissed as a cash-in game, not even close. Just beware – completionist mentality is recommended.","February 14","true","17.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

For those who may not know, this is a combination of 2 original titles - Lego Star Wars and Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy. I have played neither of those but from my understanding, their recreation in this "Complete Saga" is pretty faithful to the original games with some minor changes here and there. One of the nice bonus features is that they let you play the original version of 2 stages from the first game and you can tell that they definitely made some improvements in terms of the maneuvering and physics on those stages. However on one of the stages they also made it a lot easier by essentially removing certain goals that have to be met throughout the stage to continue.\n\nOn the whole thoguh, if you've played most any Lego game before, then you know what to expect. If not, then expect to smash a lot of stuff, play as a lot of different characters from the Star Wars series and use those characters' various abilities to progress through stages and find the insane amount of collectibles, if you so choose. As with most Lego games, this game goes almost overboard on the sheer amount content and collectibles that you have to play and find to achieve 100% if you're a completionist like me. This one really almost wore me down and I feel that they maybe put a bit TOO much, but you certainly get your money's worth.\n\nAll in all, if you're a Lego game fan and/or a Star Wars fan, I would recommend this game. It does a very good job of staying mostly faithful to the Star Wars movies, while taking some creative liberties in order to keep gameplay consistent. It also has the light-hearted humor throughout that the Lego games are known for and I think that Star Wars fans will appreciate most of it. Again though, be prepared for a slight feeling of antiquated controls and mechanics if you've played newer Lego games, sepcifically Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars because they have definitely continously made gameplay improvements over the years.","April 13","true","86.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spackeck/recommended/32440/","spackeck","Spackeck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spackeck/","301 products in account","The Star Wars fanbase is a tumultuous one. At the time of Lego Star Wars’ release, the franchise consisted of a fantastic trilogy, an awful trilogy and a mess of other content of varying quality. There are various groups of Star Wars fans with different opinions—some defend the prequel trilogy wholeheartedly while others are more down-to-earth, insisting that there hasn’t been a good Star Wars film in over 30 years.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of Lego Star Wars is that it doesn’t seem reminiscent of either trilogy, instead bringing forth its own style of simple, family-friendly humour and simplifying down the plots of all six Star Wars film into a cartoony mashup of the popular sci-fi series and the equally popular line of children’s toys.\n\nIn theory, it’s a bizarre concept, but in practice it works rather well. The Lego adaptations of the various sets and characters from the films look fantastic, providing a wacky, cartoony art direction complemented by the game’s child-oriented sense of humour. It consists mostly of slapstick comedy by way of over-the-top animation. In fact, the graphics overall are actually very good. While the ‘photorealistic-in-2005’ textures on some of the non-Lego environmental objects are a little ugly, everything that’s made of the titular plastic bits looks great. It’s quite amusing to see well-known icons of the franchise like the famous Millennium Falcon rendered as an excessively detailed Lego model.\n\nThere is, however, a bit of a disparity in overall visual fidelity between the episodes taken from the original 2005 Lego Star Wars game and the 2006 sequel. The original trilogy characters taken from Lego Star Wars II each have unique animations and each has an exotic look about him. Han Solo winks knowingly at the camera as he twirls his laser pistol on his finger before he holsters it, Darth Vader simply taps his foot in front of security cameras rather than give the wave of acknowledgement an average Stormtrooper would. My favourite is the animation that plays when you try to punch Princess Leia as Lando Calrissian—rather than attack her, he plants a gentle kiss on her hand and bows. It’s the little details like this that make Lego Star Wars such a joy to look at.\n\nCharacters from the prequel trilogy, however, all share the same set of generic animations. I didn’t notice any of the detailed animations with them, and there was even one character I noticed who kept the ‘generic Lego smile with soulless black eyes’ expression regardless of the situation he was in. It was unnerving and honestly just felt like a bit of a cop-out. I understand that these characters were from an older game, but I think if the developer is going to re-release both of these games in a package like The Complete Saga, the least that could be done is an update to bring these parts of the game up to the quality level of the original trilogy.\n\nSurprisingly, the quality gap doesn’t stop at the animations. Allow me to give an example. Characters from the original trilogy who use laser pistols have access to a ‘dodge’ move, allow them to quickly step out of harm’s way in combat. This feature wasn’t implemented in the original game, so the characters from it cannot use this ability. This is baffling laziness on the developer’s part, and it actually makes about a quarter of the game’s characters obsolete by comparison. It’s especially embarrassing when you consider how much effort it would take—all the characters are almost exactly the same model, and all the animations are already in the game. In fact, the entire amalgamation is rife with this kind of laziness. All that’s really been done to the original game's content is a slight graphical tweak. Don’t get me wrong, everything that’s here is fantastic, even the older stuff, but I just don’t quite understand why a developer wouldn’t take the time to even out the quality so that even the content from the 2005 game feels like less of a re-tread and more like a remake.\n\nThe gameplay itself is essentially a 3D platformer with an emphasis on combat, puzzles and collectible items. The levels are beautifully rendered as Lego models, though there are a lot of models and textures designed to look like real-world objects. It’s a little disappointing that not everything’s made of Lego, but it still a treat to look at.\n\nThe controls are sufficient. I did find that far too many actions are bound to the B button, and the vehicle-based levels are an absolute nightmare in general, but the ground-based levels control well enough. The combat is extremely simple—it’s not really viable to use more than two buttons—but I still found it engaging, perhaps because of the (mostly) superb animations.\n\nLego Star Wars uses sounds taken almost exclusively from the films, and it works fantastically. John Williams' score speaks for itself, but it’s not even just that—every sound effect is authentic to the point where just listening to the game’s audio could leave you thinking you were actually watching one of the films. The way the characters collide with a soft click is so charming, and fits with the game’s overall style perfectly.\n\nThe Complete Saga has a whole lot of content. There are 37 levels total, 20 side missions (given out by the illustrious Jabba the Hutt), 160 characters and a variety of vehicles. I do have a problem with the character roster, however. Out of the huge selection, there are maybe 8 that aren’t just remodels of other characters. To make matters worse, a lot of characters are just another character minus one ability. Every Jedi is identical, and every Sith is just a Jedi with an extra ability, thereby invalidating the need to ever play as a Jedi outside of story mode. There are a ton of other comparisons that can be drawn up, which I’d bet would invalidate over half the roster. I get that they want to include everyone from the films, but it feels like they could have buffed up a lot of the weaker guys. Sure, that may end up with most characters being reskins of others, but that’s still a better alternative to what happens now.\n\nOn the topic of content, a lot of The Complete Saga’s replayability feels pretty contrived. For instance, within each and every level there are 10 ‘minikit canisters’ that will give the player a new vehicle once collected. The problem is, most of these canisters can only be acquired using abilities that the player does not have in story mode, thereby mandating a second playthrough of the level in ‘free play’ mode to reach 100% completion. ‘Free play’ mode is the same as story mode, but it removes the cutscenes and allows the player to choose one of their unlocked characters to play as throughout the level. They may then swap between a select group of characters on the fly. This party of characters is selected based on their abilities, ensuring that you will always have access to every ability in the game as long as you’re in free play mode. It’s good fun to go back through early levels searching for collectibles as Darth Vader (obviously the best character), but I just wish it didn’t feel so much like the game was trying to force multiple playthroughs. It’s a minor criticism, however. I still had a great time in free play mode.\n\nOverall, The Complete Saga does feel like a bit of a lazy compilation of two fantastic games, but I’m still going to recommend it based purely on the outstanding quality and unique style of those original games.","January 15","true","54.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

In keeping with the Wii game, this is also incredible. It's fun, and a hell of a lot of it. At their core, Lego games are pretty basic: Get your Lego minifigures and go nuts in some themed setting, which appeals amazingly to children (Exhibit A being myself about 10 years ago). But the more intricate features (gold/power brick unlocks, challenge mode, etc.) are enough to keep more hardened gamers (Exhibit A being myself right now) coming back for more.\n\nAnd it's Star Wars. Jar Jar actually has a purpose in this game, and you can quite successfully fight Darth Vader with Darth Vader in Free Play mode.\n\nBrilliant game, and the nostalgia rush makes it even better.\n9.5/10\n\n","February 12","true","7.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With the funny easter eggs, tons of characters to unlock including creating your own minifigure from various parts and pieces, visual gags made by characters to explain plot points without the need of annoying voice acting like the newer Lego games and the sheer madness of cute minifigure replicas of beloved characters from the movies. This is the definitive Lego game to play and I highly recommend it. 10/10","October 27, 2015","true","3.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Es ist ein besonderes Spiel für mich als Star Wars Begeisterten. Es lässt einen in die Athmosphäre der Filme eintauchen und die Handlung erneut mit etwas mehr Humor erleben. Und obwohl die Grafik und die Animationen mitlerweile etwas überholt und nicht mehr den heutigen LEGO-Standarts entsprechen, ist es keinen Tick unattraktiver geworden als es damals schon war.

Unfortunately, that means that this very early one is missing a lot of the refinements that have been added as the series has developed.  While it still has the enjoyable LEGO rendition of familiar characters and scenes, as well as the trademark sense of humour, this particular game gets repetetive pretty quickly and lacks the variety of later games.  It's the first LEGO game where I couldn't be bothered to get 100%, mostly because that required replaying the same missions on a timer.  It was a good way to get ready for The Force Awakens, but it just doesn't measure up to Marvel Superheroes or the Harry Potter games.\n\nAlso, I found it interesting that the prequels were just as boring and reprehensible in LEGO form as they were in the cinema.  I suppose that didn't help.\n\nIn order to decide whether to recommend it, I imagined there were no other LEGO games.  On its own, it's good enough.  It's just nowhere near their later offerings.","February 1","true","54.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This games was my childhood and still to this day is one of and if not the best LEGO game out there. I originally got this for the 360 on the Christmas it came out and still play it to this day. The graphics hold up to this day and if you need some nostalgia in your life, I would highly recommend this game, and my most Hope for A New LEGO game is when the rest of the movies come out (7-9, including side stories) will combine all the movies into one game, and to have hours upon hours of content to complete. Overall this game is very great, hours upon hours of content, tons of characters to collect, and great replay value\n\n\nMy overall rating would probably be 999999999²²²²²²²²²²/10","May 13","true","20.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's super fun. Great game if you love Star Wars or LEGO games. The levels for episodes 1-3 seem pretty short, I wish they were longer, but episodes 4-6 are fairly long.

When I was younger I bought the other ones seperately and I loved them, this time it's even better with both of them combined. I remember this being a big part of my childhood along with some of the other Lego games that came out back then. People would probably say "This is a kids game." which they are correct but anyone can enjoy this very fun game. I love the collectibles and secrets to be found and the wide range of characters you can use in free play. All in all I would give this game a 4/5.\n\nP.S I can't wait to see what they do with the upcoming movies like 7, 8 and 9 and even maybe the spinoff movie Rogue 1. What do you guys think? Will the revamp the original 2 games with new levels and updated graphics? Or make 7, 8 and 9 all into one game and maybe not add Rogue 1. Thing is though the fans would have to wait 2 years between each movie until we can get a game if they were to do 7, 8 and 9 all together or they might just do the single movies and make them really long.","September 19, 2015","true","56.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

However before I sing the praises let me bring up two huge issues for me. One is the A.I. it is utterly inept.  You REALLY REALLY want to play with someone in co-op, as the A.I side kick does NOTHING.  NO help of ANY kind while you fight.  I am sure this is a result of wanting players to use the co-op feature.  An that is my second issue.  This really really is best served as a co-op play.  You will enjoy it far more if you play with a friend, the wife, the hubby, the kids...anyone but the A.I.  Now to recap the great here.  All Star Wars films, the original 4,5,6 and the prequel 1,2, and 3.  All here, all very in depth, insideously cute, and amazingly deep.  The collectable got to get every Lego alone is a 100 to 150 hours alone.  The reply value here is endless..... An for Any fan of Star Wars really needs to sit back, re enter the universe and do not be afraid to smile, and see it Lego style.

The Mos Espa Podrace is now fully 3D rendered, no longer has a timer for each segment of each lap, and is far more forgiving about hitting obstacles, making it much less frustrating to play and much easier to get True Jedi on.  If you want to see what the original was like, it's available to play in the bonus section.\n\nSorry I can't really go more in-depth, I just don't think I need to. I'm extremely happy that I can play this game again.  You get to play through all six Star Wars movies (even if only 4, 5, and 6 actually exist...), in LEGO style with plenty of humor thrown in.\n\nAlso, YOU CAN KILL JAR JAR BINKS.  REPEATEDLY.

The first thing to know about any LEGO game is that they are designed to be casual, fun, and a family friendly experience. If you need to be challenged in order to enjoy a game, then this is not the game for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for a casual bit of fun, then this game is exactly that.\nCompared to the more recent LEGO games, LEGO Star Wars has a lot less to offer besides the main missions. Unlike the Lord of the RIngs, and Marvel Super Heroes games, there is no open world to explore, and there are no side quests, but LEGO Star Wars should provide at least 12 hours of gameplay despite this.\nLike with every LEGO game, the gameplay is fun and inventive, and packed full of humour. If you enjoy 'collectathons' then you will love this, as there are dozens of characters to unlock, numerous secret collectables to find, and millions of studs to extract.\nI would recommend that you play this game with a controller, as it's unfortunately a somewhat lazy console port with unusual key mapping. Overall though, LEGO Star Wars is a good, fun game.\n\n7/10\n\nA good game, but wait for a sale.","February 25","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's just so incredibly charming in the way it presents everything, and absolutely everything is interactive in some way. As you wander through the Star Wars movies in hack and slash/pantomime form, just about all the props and set pieces can be smashed or prodded with character abilities to make something interesting or funny happen and get some sort of reward. It's extremely entertaining to poke everything and see what happens...at least through the prequel levels.\n\nUnfortunately, once I got to the original trilogy, the pacing completely fell apart. The levels went from being tightly constructed and bite-sized, which works extremely well with the density of stuff to fiddle with, to fairly long and tedious right when episode four hit. I'm not really sure I have the patience to keep going, which is a shame because when it comes to the movies themselves, I hate the prequels and was really looking forward to the second half of the game being even more amazing than the first half based on that.","March 1, 2013","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is solid and has good humor.  However, the controls are rough if you're using a keyboard and mouse.\n\nThere is no mouse support whatsoever, not even on menus.  You can rebind all the keys to any buttons on keyboards, joysticks, etc.  I highly recommend playing this with a controller or even a joystick.\n\nAs with most Lego games, you can play local co-op on a single computer, which is a great feature.  Supsequently, there is no online co-op.  However, co-op is nearly impossible with a keyboard.  Essentially, one player uses one half of the keyboard and the other player uses the second half.  This isn't the issue though.  The problem is that regular keyboards cannot register more than 4 keys being pressed at the same time, so sometimes one player won't be able to attack or jump.  If you have a mechanical keyboard, this isn't an issue.  Ideally both players should have controllers, but either player can bind their controls to any kind of input peripheral.","February 5","true","27.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is so funny to think that LEGO made a Star Wars game - and even better - it works! It totally works, and that's the beauty of it. It is easy to pick up and just as easy to plop it right down again (Yeah, stay right there on the ground!). LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga offers a fun and simple experience to enjoy alone or with friends. I had just as fun hacking away with my green LEGO lightsaber alone as I did with my brother.\n\nThe gameplay mostly consists of building, fighting and figuring out simple but rewarding puzzles, while collecting addictive collectables and new characters from the expansive Star Wars-mythos. I love how these games aren't very hard but still so gosh darn rewarding. It's quite an achievement and I've liked it since I was just a little youngling myself.\n\nLEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga gets a score of\n8/10\nfrom me.

Well, there's a secret backstory for that review, because I'm fairly sure that Lego Star Wars was the first game I ever played, and the conditions and brother were even MORE trying then. The disc and laptop were worse, we were younger and thus worse at games, the shared keyboard was even more compact, and we only ever got to play it on long car rides, where every bump on the road knocked the disc around in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ holder and spawned another game-breaking glitch. Truly a crucible of early gaming.\n\nWell, it wasn't the entire thing. The version we had was just Lego Star Wars 2, which was Episodes 4-6 (which happen to be the ones I just completed the story mode for). We didn't get the full package until a couple of years later, when it was one of the two games we got along with our new Wii for Christmas. To justify its existence as 2 games stapled together, it added a few new features, like new bonus levels, a 1v1 mode, and powerups scattered throughout the levels, all of which are fairly pointless. As to the levels themselves, episodes 4-6 are far stronger than episodes 1-3, for what I think are a few reasons: 1, more interesting things happen in the originals; 2, it came out a year later, when all the developers had finally earned their game design degrees; 3 (and this is complete speculation), the devs probably had more love for the originals than for the new ones; and 4, I have more nostalgia for the parts I played first and therefore those parts are better. Shut up, it's true.\n\nAnd as for the game itself? Well, it's not nearly as polished as Lego Indiana Jones (the devs clearly learned more the more games they made, which is a trend I support), but for what it is, it's fantastic. Coming back, not only was I realizing how much fun I was having in just the first level, but I was also experiencing almost crying levels of nostalgia for things that had all come rushing back from almost a decade ago. I remembered that puzzle with the crane! I remembered wanting to be R2-D2 or Captain Antilles! Oh my God! Rebel Friend! I remembered Rebel Friend!\n\nAnyway, nostalgic tangents aside, the same rules apply for this as they do for Lego Indiana Jones; everything's either good game design, funny and/or goofy, or probably broken (or John Williams's score). Tell you what, if I ever make a game, I'm going to hire all the animators from Traveler's Tales, because those guys know how to do an incredible amount with very little. Look up the intro cutscene for Episode 6, Stage 5. See how they convey all (or at least most of) the conflict and emotion of the scene in the movie, in the space of about 30 seconds, using absolutely no dialogue, with F*CKING LEGO FIGURES? These people are masters!\n\nAlso, they managed to nail the vital Stormtrooper balance of adorably bad but taken completely seriously. You should buy the game for just that.\n\nP.S. If you think it's just a game for kids, go to the Zero Punctuation for Lego Indiana Jones and listen to what he has to say about kid-oriented vs. family-oriented. This one's family-oriented.\n\nP.P.S. Like the Indiana Jones review, I haven't played the whole thing through here but I did when I was younger, and I remember all of it.","January 9","true","62.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Funny and clever cutscenes, shows the key moments of all 6 films so you feel like the characters on their quest and fun gameplay. Even after finishing the main story you are only 40% done the game which means the replay value is HUGE. After beating each story chapter once you gotta play them all over again to unlock every character and all the bonus levels/collectables.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yeharual/recommended/32440/","yeharual","iJustine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yeharual/","51 products in account","Seeing how LEGO Starwars and LEGO Starwars II for the Playstation 2 were one of my more early childhood gaming experiences, I couldn't believe that they combined them both. When I looked into it more, I thought, "Heck yeah! I could be General Grevious and Boba Fett ANYWHERE!" so I bought it. Some might be thinking "what's the point to buying another game that consists of two other games?" Well, some parts of levels are changes with new mechanics, and there are even more levels you can play (consisting with 6 chapters in Attack of The Clones instead of 5, bounty hunter levels where you go on the hunt for characters throughout the levels, and extra levels which you unlock using the Gold Bricks you have aquired throughout playing.) Yes, I do admit, the game is somewhat slow when you begin it, but once you unlock some stuff, it's a blast. If you are looking for a challenge and only a challenge, these may not be the droids you're looking for. This game is more of a casual, relax time of game consisting of collect-a-thon with combat and exploring elements built in. If you want to get the maximum experience of the game, go for "True Jedi" by collecting a certain amount of stud in each level, also find all ten minikits in each level (which requires free-play) find all red-bricks, and do the challenges the game offers you (Blue minikits and speedruns of movie). This game's presentation is absolutely amazing. All of your favorite characters in LEGO, and you get to play as most of them. The cutscenes could use voice acting to improve them, but overall, they are entertaining to watch, and they look very clean. Also, The Prequels are actually tolerable now since you dont have to play as Anakin hating sand, and boring hour-long consle meetings. I am somewhat disappointed that you cant play Anakin's side of the story much in Revenge of the Sith, it would be cool to be the bad guy for a couple levels. But overall this is a very good game I extremeley reccomend it to any Starwars and/or LEGO fan.","January 23","true","22.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I played it a lot as a kid and this is a very good port, so take what you will from the original version if you played it. It's not a great game by any means but it's quite hilarious, the puzzles are a bit easy and most of the platforming is mindless, but shooting lego minifigures with backwards megaphones and watching them disassemble is always cute.

I am literally speechless. This is THE perfect game. With its fun and memorable levels, tons of different characters, bonus content, hilarious hijinx, and the ability to play as LEGO minifigures, how can you go wrong. I actually own both of the previous installments that make up this game(Lego Star Wars) and (Lego Star Wars 2 The Origional Trilogy), and yet I knew I still wanted this game just to see everything collide. This game built up my expectations and knocked them completely out of the park. One of the key factors of this game that I don't think other lego games of our time have are the fun, and not to be redundant but, memorable levels, characters, and events that all can be linked to the origional source material. Traveler's Tales really outdid itself with the creation of this game. As an ENORMOUS Star Wars enthusiest, it makes me feel so glad how much effort and tlc was put into this game unlike others who purchase the rights merely to sell basic games just under the name of "Star Wars". This is one of the only games I actually reccomend to all people for its amazingly fun and sometimes addicting gameplay and its intensly immersive experience. I of course, give this game a ten out of ten for its sheer creativity, fun loving characters, truity to the films, immersive environents, mesmerizing mechanichs, and most importantly, its impact on how I see the art of Gaming.","May 6, 2015","true","9.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But there's a bunch of problems that are making me think that I've wasted my ♥♥♥♥ing money buying this.\n\n1. Friendly Ai's don't do ANY sort of damage to the Enemy Ai.\n\nI've had this stupid thing happen to me all the time. The worst incident was on the death star and the Hoth mission. I had to build something to get to the next part of the level, but it was extremelly hard due to the fact that the AI's can't do ANY sort of damage towards the Hostile Ai's. It took me a total of 2 or something hours just to get through the Death Star mission, just because of that.\n\n2. You stop building when you get shot.\n\nThis is quite annoying, when you have to build something and there's a bunch of guys shooting at you, the AIs you are set with cannot do any damage and cannot protect you. If you're shot while building, you'd have to start all over again.\n\n\nThere's many more problems, but I cannot be bothered to list them all. These are all of the problems I have ran into as of right now. I would reccomend this game, although the problems  are fairly annoying.","May 10","true","42.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

However, disappointment reigned as my son and I discovered "Local COOP" really means, shared keyboard or multiple game controllers used on ONE computer.\n\nHad high hopes we could play drop-in-style as a family or with friends using either our laptops or desktops wherever we were comfortable at home or away:(\n\nSo, I'm rating this a thumbs down on that one hangup as otherwise I'd have saved the cost of buying multiple copies and just stayed with the console version.","June 14, 2015","false","1.0"," 6 of 39 people (15%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","15","6","39","0","0"

Childhood memories 'n stuff from the old PS2 days, funny gameplay, lots of characters, Controller support.\nThe reason I am still not recommending this game is the following: The local Co-op sucks. Seriously. It is not possibly to freely move around the area, the camera is even worse than the one from Devil may cry. You and your Co-op partner can't just go wherever you want with a proper split screen. No, the screen doesn't split at all. Sometimes you are even being forced to move with your partner without actually pressing a button. We fell off cliffs several times, just because we were standing a few meters too far apart from each other.\n\nSo yeah, anyway,\nFunny game, funny Single-player, but the local Co-op is a joke.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/planr/recommended/32440/","planr","Planr, King of Noobs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/planr/","37 products in account","I absolutely LOVED lego star wars games as a kid. I have fond memories of playing them on the PS2 when I was younger.\nGoing back to them now after roughly 7-10 years though, they are sadly nowhere near as good as I remembered them being as a kid.\n\nMy main problem is with Disney, who owns the rights to the Lego Star Wars games. They are total money-grabbing jerks whose business practices I daresay are even worse than Rockstar Studios (we all "fondly" remember the sale scams Rockstar did the past few steam sales, where they jacked up the base price of GTA5 so that the "sale" price would be no different from the normal price). This game hasn't gone on sale in YEARS and there is no sign that DIsney has any plans on selling this fairly. Now if this was a brand-new Lego game with cutting-edge graphics, really good gameplay and a long storyline, i'd definitely say the selling price is fair, but there is absolutely NO justification for selling this 10-year-old game for 20 freaking dollars. It's a total ripoff.\n\nNow that I've got that off my chest, let's move on to the pros and cons of the game.\n\nPROS\nLiterally hundreds of different Star Wars characters to play as\nClassic Lego feel\nEnvironments are quite interactive\nCombines the 1st and 2nd Lego Star Wars games into 1.\nCONS\nGraphical quality has deteriorated significantly over the years. The Prequel Episode levels are virtually unchanged from how they were back in 2005. The PlayStation 2 graphics are real.\nNo online Multiplayer\nGame is specifically designed for young children. The gameplay is just so uninteresting if you're an older person like me that it's almost impossible to stand playing this for longer than a dozen hours or so.\nThe game dogmatically insists you play in Co-Op mode, as the AI for the secondary player is god-awful to have to complete levels with alone (they dont do jack to help you out in combat, and just sit there letting themselves get shot at).\nPoorly-designed flight/racing levels have incredibly frustrating gameplay, with constant running back and forth and constant dying (especially on the Geonosis gunship combat level).\nThe camera system the game uses is god-awful for telling what you're doing. It's incredibly easy to misjudge jumps and where your position is when platforming. Also it makes it really hard to see what you want or need to see in the environment around you.\nFlight controls for the racing/flight levels are god-awful. Making sharp turns when you need to fly over a specific object (eg. money, torpedo stockpiles) is practically impossible as the game instead just makes you do a sharp, huge 180 flip and go in the opposite direction. It's awful for maneuvering in tight spaces, and since colliding with the walls does damage, it makes unintentionally dying a massive issue. It can also undesirably launch you into the path of dangerous weapons fire when you just wanted to turn, which is also very bad. I can't count how many times I died due to this god-awful flight control system on the Geonosis map, or on the Coruscant Speeder Chase map.\nGameplay becomes extremely repetitive and uninteresting from the very start. 90% of your time playing on levels is just spent running around destroying or messing with stuff to get more money/studs, and then running around in a frenzy trying to pick up as many studs as you can before they abruptly disappear.\nNo real worthwhile objective to work toward in the game except getting more money and more lego characters. No meaningful or interesting story to want to complete, as it's all the same repetitive crap every map and every level, with constant unwarranted deaths in a mad scramble for getting as much studs as you can.\nThe awesome Lego City map from Lego Star Wars 2 has been basically chopped in half with the most interesting parts taken out, and that's the Lego City map on this game. It absolutely sucks. They got rid of the boat and the lake (my favorite part), as well as some other fun buildings and locations.\nAll in all, this game was perhaps fun to play back 7 or 8 years ago but it has since lost a lot of its replay value, and will easily come across as boring and bland to anyone above the age of 12. I'd only recommend buying this if you have a super bad case of nostalgia (but even then I guarantee you will be disappointed when you play this).","November 13, 2015","false","6.2"," 14 of 59 people (24%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","24","14","59","5","1"

The puzzles are largely intuitive, and with a few awkward exceptions (like Dagobah), it's pretty straightforward to figure out what to do next.  The combat is pretty easy but fun, perfect for running with kids.  We're enjoying it for the most part.\n\nHowever, local co-op mode has a lot of problems with it.  It's very easy to accidentally drag your partner off of a cliff by moving in the wrong direction.  Several chapters, like the pod race, require both players to play perfectly. Basically, the game is actually much *harder* as a local co-op game than as a single-player game, which basically defeats the purpose of local co-op.  Often, we'll just have one person drop out when a section becomes especially hard to do with two people.","August 15, 2014","true","44.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was kind of my introduction into the Star Wars universe, to be honest. I preferred the first one simply because I was more familiar with the prequels at the time (ew, I know), and I'll always miss the original Lego Star Wars hub, Dexter's Diner.\n\nAnyway,\n\nThe Complete Saga is a wonderful combination of the (first) two Lego Star Wars games. It adds Red Bricks to the original prequel levels, new characters etc, you know the drill, you read the product description. It essentially acts as a PC port / HD remake for the best games in the Lego video games franchise, and you should absolutely buy it whether you played it in the past or not. If you miss the platformer days of the PS2 era - that is to say, collectibles, fun combat, the occassional puzzle, unlockable characters, no rubbish DLC - this is the game for you.\n\nIt pretty much never goes on sale, but I'd say it's worth £15.\n\nAlso, you can create your own C3PO with a droid head and Sith powers, so that's pretty rad.","February 6, 2015","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay is now concidered basic, but it isn't so basic as to make this boring, leaving a serie of levels that brim with the kind of magic we've learned to love. Humor at every turn fills the cutscenes, the secrets are well hidden, collectibles aplenty, characters out the wazoo.\n\nRecommended for: Fans of the LEGO® games that want to experience the origin of it all, fans of Star Wars® games.","January 11, 2015","true","54.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

WHY would ANYONE buy this game? Well I'll tell you. Pure. Sheer. Simple. Fun.\n\nI loved Lego as a child and having it in video game form is no different. You can play co-op with someone (not online thankfully) and have the time of your life as Traveller's Tales successfully manages to blend the joy of Lego and the entire Star Wars movies into a hilarious game. The presentation is top stuff and the brief cutscenes have great delivery and humour which will leave you chuckling. Bring out your inner child and don't expect some crazy supah dupah stuff. Buy this game for fun and it will deliver.\n\nReplayability... oh gawd, now that will take you most likely hundreds of hours. There is so much packed into this game and so many goodies to find that you'll be foaming at the mouth at all the collectables. So what are you waiting for? Want fun?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AKLANK/recommended/32440/","AKLANK","Klankers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AKLANK/","284 products in account","The Pros\nThis gem has lasted 10 solid years, providing a memorable spitscreen, pick-up-and-play approach that makes it fun to play with others.  The story mode itself has brief, adapted cutscenes from the actual films that make me feel warm inside.  Combine that with a vast array of characters, unlockable (not downloadable) content, quality sound, and a lovable asthetic; and you've got a solid 20 hour experience that will stick with you for a while.\n\nThe Cons\nI said it's a gem, but even gems get dirty.  While it shines in sheer quantity of gameplay and multiplayer, the game has a few other problems.  It feels slightly dated, even though it's very similar graphically to any other recent LEGO release.  As someone no longer in elementary/middle school, the controls feel a little clunky, the combat overly-simplified, camera angles frusterating, and overall experience underwhelming.  I loved piloting the X-wing on the surface of the LEGO Death Star, but had no clue what I was really doing and just held down the fire button.\n\nMy Verdict\nThough it pales in comparison to other games (Like Marvel Super Heroes) by simply feeling dated, I genuinely believe that it's a game that everyone deserves to experience.  Grab it when it's on sale, a friend, and play for a few hours to feel like that 6th-grade stud hoarder everyone is inside.  Instructions not included.\n\n7.5/10","June 14, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then again, I could also rant about how easy the secrets are to find, how horrible the flying segments are, and how eye-roll-y the humor can become at times. At the end of the day, this is a good game to waste some of your time playing. If you have a favorite Star Wars character (from the original six... but you can still recreate your own Kyle Katarn with the custom character builder), they're all here and in every single bloody format. Would you like to play as Anakin? Okay. Which version? Boy? Padawn? Jedi? Darth Vader? Ghost? .... ROBOT!? Each character has great advantages (or disadvantages, if you're favorite character is Chancellor Palpatine since he can't do jack) to help in a level or to solve a puzzle (which is about as subtly laden as The Strip in Las Vegas). But in the end, I'll give a thumbs up for this game, since this is my 47th time playing this, and I just realized this game currently holds the most playtime on my list, and- unlike Mass Effect 2- it didn't feel like a chore half the time I spent getting there.","May 13, 2015","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As you would expect from a title like this, you will embark on a journey across the entire 6 episodes of Star Wars, following a fairly close storyline to that of the movies - just don't expect as much detail. It took me 9 hours to get through all the main levels, although I only finished about 40% of the game, so clearly there is a lot to see and do! With over 120 playable characters, 6 episodes with 6 chapters each, bonus levels, collectibles throughout all levels, and local co-op drop-in drop-out mode, what is there not to love!\n\nEverything from character designs, classic scenes and vehicles, and sounds are just brilliant! The combat and puzzle elements are what is to be expected from a LEGO game (and if you're not familiar with them, what I mean by this is that they're nothing too special), but it's LEGO... and Star Wars... so the game has to be good! And it is!! Although I did enjoy the first 3 episodes over the Original Trilogy... sorry die-hard fans - I just found that in the game they were more interesting and less tedious.\n\nOverall, it's a fantastic game, and it's something that anyone can get into - regardless of age or interest. May the force be with you!\n\nEnjoy! :D","May 22, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Except for 3 I think.)\n\nPerformance on for this game is great, but for me it stuttered a bit in middle of levels due to loading sequences.

Then again, I could also rant about how easy the secrets are to find, how horrible the flying segments are, and how eye-roll-y the humor can become at times. At the end of the day, this is a good game to waste some of your time playing. If you have a favorite Star Wars character (from the original six... but you can still recreate your own Kyle Katarn with the custom character builder), they're all here and in every single bloody format. Would you like to play as Anakin? Okay. Which version? Boy? Padawn? Jedi? Darth Vader? Ghost? .... ROBOT!? Each character has great advantages (or disadvantages, if you're favorite character is Chancellor Palpatine since he can't do jack) to help in a level or to solve a puzzle (which is about as subtly laden as The Strip in Las Vegas). But in the end, I'll give a thumbs up for this game, since this is my 47th time playing this, and I just realized this game currently holds the most playtime on my list, and- unlike Mass Effect 2- it didn't feel like a chore half the time I spent getting there.","May 13, 2015","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's nice to have levels with some of the vehicles in it and be able to have the ship battles. My biggest complaint out of the entire game would have to be the lightsaber combat. It feels really slow and clunky. Not really sure what could be done to change that but that part gets kind of annoying every once in a while.

I mean, you get to experience these movies so deeply embedded in pop culture in a new light with LEGO's quirky and charming humor. And this is the one that truly started it. That is not to say past LEGO games were bad, LEGO island being a nostalgic and fun experience for me. But it's LEGO Star Wars that truly kicked it up a few notches to what it currently is right now.\n\nThe Complete Saga has you playing through the prequels trilogy and the original trilogy. Each episodes are seperated into six missions based on the more important parts of their respective movies. But though you may think this game is just about going through levels in LEGO form, there is much to do. Each level has Red Bricks (Which are little extras that give you some new or enhanced abilities), you also get to collect 10 minikits which are hidden in the levels (sometimes completely out of your reach because your current set of characters do not possess the ability to reach it). Collecting studs allows you to buy characters and vehicles and collecting enough of them during missions gets you True Jedi status (which gives you a Gold Brick). Upon completion of the story mode, you unlock Free Play and Challenge mode. Free Play has you playing through the level with a set of randomized characters specifically for their abilites to get some of the minikits you cannot normally get during story mode, giving this game some actual replay value. Challenge has you going after 10 blue minikits within the level altough you are now on a timer and the location of these minikits has been mixed up a bit. So, basically, if you are going for 100%, you'll get to experience these levels minimum three times.\n\nThis game's soundtrack is also from the movies, which is a plus within itself. The complete Saga features also 2 player co-op (local), 6 bonus levels that were in the original installments of these two games' seperate releases (Harder versions basically). On top of that, there are 160 Gold Bricks in the game. You get 3 per level: 1 for beating the level in story mode, 1 for collecting all minikits, 1 for obtaining True Jedi status. 14 can be bought in the Mos Eisley Cantina and 6 for the aforementioned Bonus levels. All in all, you have a crap ton to do in this game.\n\nWith the plethora of content, replay value, addictive gameplay and the chance to exprience Star Wars in LEGO form, I absolutely recommend this game. Nearly 10 years later, this game is still fun and has yet to show its age.","July 5, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said, I find 60% of the time I spent on the 2007 title I was hard-pressed not to put the game for good. Controls and scripting have improved so much with later games that it is just a hassle to deal with their state in this game. Plus, I don't understand how over a decade after games came to PCs there are still unskippable cutscene.\n\nRecommendation: I started to play this game because it's a LEGO game and kept at it because I like to 100% a game. If you think, that description fits you as well and you are prepared for some discouraging game design, I'd say, go get the game. Same if you think you're satisfied with only going through the story missions once - this was quite fun. Otherwise you may just want to get a newer LEGO game. They are objectively better.\n\n+ LEGO game\n+ The Star Wars saga retold\n+ Loads of characters from the Star Wars universe (+1 extra)\n+ Lots of levels\n- Outdated controls\n- Immaturely scripted "player 2"\n- Immature camera / point of view\n- Flying missions include long and unnerving sounds\n- Unskippable cutscenes\n- I repeat, unskippable cutscenes\n- Reward collection policies\n\nBrace yourself. What follows is as much a review as a rant, read as psycho hygiene, and thus may transport negative feelings.\n\nWhy "60% of the time"? Well, it took me about 40% to get through the story mode, the rest of the time was spent bringing the savegame to 100%.\nThe game has an in-built requirement for replaying levels if you want to get to 100%. AFAIR each story level, and there are many, requires the completionist to play it at least four times. There are quite a few levels outside the story, a welcome diversion. Replaying levels, of course, also restarts the connected cutscenes. Of those you can skip the very first story cutscene, which is directly followed by another cutscene you cannot skip. Throughout each level you'll encounter more transitional cutscenes - none of which are skippable. I actually want to follow the story of a game so I'm cool with games requiring you to stick through cutscenes. Still I would strongly advocate to make every piece of a game that takes up time but doesn't provide game play to be skippable at the player's discretion. The game already got the player's money and shouldn't unnecessarily commandeer the player's time. I had times when the game actually felt like a boring chore.\nThe controls are somewhat outdated. When running into a "steep" inclination you usually cannot jump. This is right away irritating because it takes away the functionality of one of the main buttons without apparent explanation. I guess, it's because you're supposed to slide on steep inclinations - a nicer device to limit levels than invisible walls (which are also in the game) - and at the bottom you're sort of halfway on the inclination. There are some places where you can slide into stuff in a way that makes it very hard to slide around them which is nevertheless the only option - except for quitting - since you cannot jump at the time.\nStairs are usually a device to ease ascent, in this game they often fail to do so. You're often better off just jumping up stairs. In case they are winding you'll notice that the game is a bit lacking in providing a sense of depth. Although the camera is not too close to the ground most of the time, the camera often jumps between certain pretty fix position, then swivels. This in combination with upwards movement can lead to unfortunate angles.\nWhen playing in "free play" you can effectively choose two characters that enter a level and the game will provide a number of further characters in a way that all skills necessary to complete a level's secondary goals are available. You can then switch between those characters. I couldn't figure out how the game sorts the extras and so had to learn them for each level.\nYou're always running around with at least two characters. That way you can play as one or two players. The extra character(s) can be quite a hassle. If there are fewer players than characters you can tag and change the currently played character. When you're running with more characters it can be hard to change to the wanted character. When attacking something extra characters are often in the way as the auto-aiming rather hits an extra than anything else. Sometimes extras are blocking you sometimes they keep their distance when you want to tag them. NPC cooperation, e.g. when having to pull two levers at roughly the same time, is still a bit lacking in this game.\nThe problem with camera angles is even more problematic with ingame rewards, mainly LEGO studs that act as currency in the game and are also part of secondary level goals. Reward collection policy in LEGO games has always been an issue with me, right from the first time a stud vanished into an abyss. So what about the camera? The studs in this game do not have a shadow so their movement in 3D space is somewhat hard to follow. Sometimes you can translate from the movement of another stud moving on the screen plane, i.e. at a right angle to the player's line of sight. Why do you need to follow movement anyway? Most ingame rewards vanish after about 4 seconds which is relatively short. Most ingame rewards are not collectible right away, i.e. studs usually have approximately a second after they appear in which they are protected from collection. Some rewards drop down an abyss or jump behind a wall right away. If there wasn't the argument that there are basically always more studs to collect I'd find that unbearable - so I'm only somewhat upset. Also, game designers were aware of that as is evidenced by the fact that certain levels change policy so that every stud is automatically collected.\nMy policy would have all studs collectible right away, no time-related vanishing, no jumping through walls and always dropping a shadow.\nThe game has a few dead-ends, i.e. places you can get to but cannot get away from without quitting a level. There is also a bit of unnecessary tunneling. Example 1: In free play despite having a character that can theoretically make it across wide abysses the game still drops you into the abyss because it just wants you to take the scenic route. Example 2: Some silver object cannot be bombed unless some other object has been built despite the object to-be-build and the silver object never interacting.\nThere are a few flying missions. Whenever you happen to collect a power-up - which due to bad visibility cannot always be avoided - the game starts to make an unnerving sound for the duration of the power-up. Later in my game I simply turned off sounds altogether.\n\nAgain, I recommend LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga to those that don't mind playing only the main part of the game or have a high tolerance against boredom when 100%-ing.","February 12","true","64.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I used to play it on my Wii all the time, but it looks so much better on the PC. I did have one slight issue running the title on Windows 10, everytime I tried to change the screen resolution the game froze and crashed but I was able to resolve this by going into the install location and setting the application to run in Windows 7 compatability mode. It is a little awkward playing this game with a keyboard at first because it will not allow you to use the mouse at all but you get used to it, I may invest in an Xbox controller though. I would definatbly recomend this game though, even though it may have a few minor quarks.","December 1, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think this marked the first lego game made but it still stands up well compared to some of their newer hits like jurassic world or the batmans. Obviously the graphics are dated and some of the well known lego game features arent present but this game makes it all up. It's replayibility is something special as well, in just one playthrough of the game you play each level at least twice and becasue each run through of the level is quite different it doesnt drag on at all, and not only that but I've played this game before both on my xbox, my ds and playstation and yet playing it again now on steam makes it all seem like a brand new experience. If you like Star Wars, lego games or just casual gaming in general then I can't recommend this game enough. Its certainly worth the asking price and certainly worth many many hours of play.","December 27, 2015","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only thing I would like to see is an updated version. Not so much to where it would ruin the game, but to where it can advance. Such as punching, targetting, a larger open world, and maybe even just adding in voice clips to the cut scenes like the newer ones today. That would be pretty cool too.

Two of these are only useful in Free Play and are never needed urgently.\n\nOne hand can cover movement and two buttons. That leaves two fingers on your other hand that have to be somewhere on the keyboard. The other two that you never need quickly could be put right near them so you can use a third finger and then MOVE one of the others to press the other button should you need it. Or use all four fingers, whichever is easier.\n\nSeriously though, it's a game with incredibly simple controls and so very straightforward, you don't need a mouse or controller to play this game and enjoy it. It sits alongside LEGO Indy 1 and LEGO Batman as the Golden Trio of LEGO games before they started adding the horror that is voice acting in a series that prided itself on mimed slapstick retellings of famous stories.

As you would expect from a title like this, you will embark on a journey across the entire 6 episodes of Star Wars, following a fairly close storyline to that of the movies - just don't expect as much detail. It took me 9 hours to get through all the main levels, although I only finished about 40% of the game, so clearly there is a lot to see and do! With over 120 playable characters, 6 episodes with 6 chapters each, bonus levels, collectibles throughout all levels, and local co-op drop-in drop-out mode, what is there not to love!\n\nEverything from character designs, classic scenes and vehicles, and sounds are just brilliant! The combat and puzzle elements are what is to be expected from a LEGO game (and if you're not familiar with them, what I mean by this is that they're nothing too special), but it's LEGO... and Star Wars... so the game has to be good! And it is!! Although I did enjoy the first 3 episodes over the Original Trilogy... sorry die-hard fans - I just found that in the game they were more interesting and less tedious.\n\nOverall, it's a fantastic game, and it's something that anyone can get into - regardless of age or interest. May the force be with you!\n\nEnjoy! :D","May 22, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_technus/recommended/32440/","the_technus","George W. Bush","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_technus/","312 products in account","TL;DR: A great nostalgia trip for Lego and/or Star Wars fans, but rough around the edges and it shows.\n\nI had the original two Lego Star wars games for Gamecube way back in the day. I played and enjoyed the hell out of both of them. So you can imagine my excitement when I realized that I could play both, in one game, on PC. I picked this title up in the winter sale and I've been playing it off and on since then.\n\nIt's just as fun as I remember it. The absence of their cringeworthy dialogue and forced love story make the prequels much more enjoyable, though it might be hard to understand if you don't already know the plot. The slapstick and Lego dismemberment gags never get old. There's easter eggs hidden everywhere, encouraging exploration, and the game's puzzles are challenging and rewarding enough to solve for players of any age without getting frustrating (most of the time).\n\nYou can play as all your favorite characters, along with many others whose names you never knew and never really cared about, like Grand Moff Tarkin or Ki-Adi-Mundi. Most of the main characters have unique and sometimes hilarious melee animations, like Princess Leia who ♥♥♥♥♥slaps everyone, or Chewbacca who will leap on stormtroopers and rip their arms off (it's all bloodless Lego gore so it's okay for kids, obviously).\n\nHowever, no game is without sin and this one commits quite a few of them.\n\nA lot of the optional characters, especially the blaster-wielding ones, have little differentiation between them besides their general appearance, so you'll probably just end up using Luke Skywalker (Jedi), Boba Fett (grown-up), and Darth Vader most of the game.\n\nThe most glaring flaws are perhaps the myriad of bugs littered throughout the game, from texture, shadow, and Z-ordering glitches (where background meshes pop through foreground ones) to areas where the Lego studs you're supposed to collect (as currency) simply clip through the floor or walls or other decorations and disappear. Since this game was released in 2009, I very much doubt that these issues will ever be resolved.\n\nSome puzzles are far more tedious than challenging; oftentimes the solution is obvious but requires a lot of work simply to make it seem more difficult than it actually is. This is a trap that many otherwise very good puzzle games (like Portal and The Talos Principle) fall into to pad out their runtimes, and I wish it would stop. Some of the optional puzzles have such obscure and nonsensical "solutions" that you're basically just trying to guess what the game designer was thinking.\n\nThere is no brightness slider, so some scenes can become very overblown, especially with the excessively strong bloom shader included in the game. Disabling bloom helps but makes other scenes look much more drab so it's a lose-lose either way. Also, and this is more of a nitpick than anything, but the screen-space reflections on windows and polished floors are inconsistent in resolution, so some are crystal clear while others are horribly pixellated.\n\nOtherwise, the game's graphics have aged about as well as they could have, considering they're rendering a world which is supposed to look like it's made of plastic. I'll have to look at other more recent Lego games and see how they've improved the engine.\n\nHowever, I really, really, really, really hate the third-person camera. This is one of those games that tries a little too hard to imitate cinema: the camera is often either in a fixed position and pans to show the characters, or pans while following a dolly path through the level. There's also the seemingly intentionally added tracking latency, where it takes a second to catch up to movement of your characters. In addition, some of the levels with mandatory platforming sections have preset camera positions which give very poor depth cues, so sometimes you have no idea if you're going to hit the platform you want or if you're going to fall to your death. Put that all together, you end up with a distracting, oftentimes misleading, and sometimes downright sickening visual ride.\n\nYou might be wondering why I'm still recommending this game, even with all these complaints. It's Lego freaking Star Wars, man. This ♥♥♥♥ sells itself.","January 15","true","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was part of my childhood. Unfortunately, I never bought the Original Saga of Lego Star Wars. This thing has them both, with a bunch of connecting details. Instead of two separate games in one bundle, they are truly combined into just one game. For example, you have to be a Stormtrooper to access areas in Episode I, II, and III. It's a joy to be able to purchase this beauty on Steam and play it with a controller. The ability to relive some of my childhood memories with a boost in the graphic quaility is amazing! I always played Lego Star Wars on older TVs, so it feels odd to see it with a 1080p resolution and higher framerate. If you want to play a Star Wars game that has a TON of content and replayability, this is certainly a viable option.There is nothing serious about it! It really is just a playground of Star Wars fun.

It takes you through all the original 6 star wars movies in a very unique lego-y way, with each episode/film split into six parts; every part is one level, taking approximately 20+ mins to complete. The main storyline takes about 20 hours or so to complete, and is fairly simple (apart from some details you might miss about what you have to do). But the game does not just hand everything to you. To get really OP, you need to replay levels and discover every little detail and corner you could not explore with the story mode team, basically just completionism. This is completely optional though, so don't freak out.\n\nThere's just so much to this game. From the amazing music with the original soundtracks, to the small little details like lando kissing leia's hand when pressing the action button, to the cheesy lego humor, to the big variety of characters to unlock, to the overall star wars-feeling overall; this game is simply a joy to play. (I found airship levels to be particularly enjoyable, with an amazing feeling to them) Admitted, combat is kind of lame, and the graphics aren't fantastic due to the fact that it is a 10 years old lego game, but the game is still enjoyable. The last complaint I have about it is that money is annoying to pick up sometimes. That's it. For a ten year old game, that's not that bad i would say, so go buy it.\n\nTl;dr version:\n+game has loads of unlockables and secrets\n+great music\n+airship levels are great\n+option to play hard or even extremely hard levels, but easily playable normal levels\n+a sh** ton of small details that make the game so much better\n+easy playability; even a brick could handle this game\n\n-Graphics are not always the best\n-combat is fairly easy\n-money is annoying to collect\n\nStraight 8.5/10","January 23","true","69.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EChondo/recommended/32440/","EChondo","EChondo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EChondo/","621 products in account",""LEGO® Star Wars™ - The Complete Saga" is basically as the name implies, it's a Lego game that contains the saga of Star Wars, well until Episode VII just released haha.\n\nThis game features a hub world where you first start and includes all 6 Episodes and within each Episode there are six Missions and one/two Bonus missions. Only Episode 1 is unlocked in the beginning, but if you complete the first mission you'll unlock all the other Episodes. So if you don't like the prequels just do the first mission and then skip the rest and jump straight into Episode 4. There is also a "Gold" bonus area that has extra content to do if you get all Gold blocks in the game.\n\nYou're not going to find voice acting in this game unless it's the droid sounds, so there is little to none of the political scenes from the movies(at least so far in Episode 1). If you're looking for pretty much an all action version of Star Wars this is the game to get that experience. However there are some missing scenes from the movie that I would have liked to see in this game like the underwater ship in Episode 1 is skipped when that could have been part of a mission for more collectibles/blocks. There is also no space scene with Anakin when he's in the N-1 which I thought could have been a cool addition. The pod racing is included however. So very mixed so far in Episode 1 of what scenes you'd expect to see. Probably more missing scenes like this in the later Episodes.\n\nAs for performance I'm getting 60fps 100% of the time in-game at 1920x1080, but when there's cutscenes I've noticed there are framedrops occuring but they come back to 60fps. So a bit stuttering when in cutscenes. Not sure what the cause is, but it isn't that big of a deal to me since I'm just watching and not playing.\n\nController support does feel perfect in the game, I don't have the time currently to find a local co-op partner and test two controllers plugged in, but I'm assuming it works fine. If it doesn't I'll update my review and make note of it.\n\nSo far I'm very happy with the game. I used to play Lego games a long time ago on my original Xbox back when it was split into two parts and this Complete Saga on PC plays exactly how I remember it years ago. I'd say it's worth $19.99 if you know you're going to be playing this and wanting to collect everything and it's 100% a for sure purchase at $5.99 on sale even if you're just going to casually run through it.","January 19","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This doesn't mean I think it's one of the best games I ever played as a kid but it's one I have very fond memories of and pretty much anyone I talk to about it has played it at some point. It's that perfect blend of co-op, collectathon, movie tie-in that's just great to play when I'm not feeling something very intense and just want to relax.\n\nThe game is most certainly flawed, the artificial difficulty and lack of any complex combat is the one of the big complaints; I never felt challenged playing this game but I also died a lot because the game throws enemies at you non stop and while they only take one hit to kill avoiding all the blaster bolts can prove annoying if you aren't a character with auto dodge. This really slows down the game and while I don't expect the most from the combat every lightsaber battle was jump attack, jump attack, jump attack ect. It's impossible to hit someone while they're blocking with anything other than the air attacks which are undodgeable by the AI if you're in range. I know this is a kids game and not meant to be challenging but after a while even kids would find this tedious at best.\n\nThe lack of online co-op is my biggest grind with this game. At first I thought it was an issue with it being such an old game that relies on single screen co-op but after checking other Lego games I realized that it was nothing more than a trend of laziness. I did manage to take my laptop to a friend's and play it with them and it was great fun except that save files are harder than needs be to locate and impossible to get working on a separate machine to the one it came from meaning we had to start a fresh with none of the cool characters I'd unlocked. Besides some of the vehicle levels being a bit lackluster and Superstory being total BS and a lazy way to recycle content these are my only real complaints with the game so from here on out it's all positive.\n\nThe Lego formula has practically been perfected now but that doesn't mean it wasn't always great. Star Wars has so much charm in its cutscenes and is very humoresque due to it's recognizable and lovable characters acting out the Star Wars story in a silly and joking way. There is so much to do in this game and so much to find. While some levels practically hand you the collectibles some can prove a real challenge to find, but if your smart you can aim to collect the stud multipliers and minikit/red brick detector red bricks giving you a hint on in which direction there is a collectible. There's also some extra game modes in the complete saga that add that make 100%ing this game a real journey as you try collect all the gold bricks.\n\nOne of the best things about Lego Star Wars is that it's well, Star Wars. Playing all your favourite Jedi battle it out on all those great planets from the Star Wars universe is immensely entertaining and even more fun in Lego. I would enjoy this game even if it wasn't Star Wars but the real heart and charm of the game comes from seeing your favorite scenes re-acted in Lego form.\n\nThere were dull moments while playing this game but I thoroughly enjoyed it and I felt both a sense of fulfillment and emptiness once I reached 100% which shows just how great this game is. May the force be with you all.","January 19","true","40.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Completely serious.\nIt takes you all across the Prequel and Original trilogy in overall well designed and fun missions.  The game isn't too hard, which might be a downside to someone looking for a challenge.  That being said, there is still a lot to do in this game.\nThe game is absolutely packed with collectibles and characters to unlock along with bonus levels and bonus abilities.  The hub world is honestly my favorite in any video game.  It's the Mos Eisley Cantina, except with additional rooms for each movie.  When you start the game, it's fairly empty.  As you collect characters though, they start to inhabit and walk around the Cantina.  So you'll see kinda funny ♥♥♥♥ like Qui-Gon casually walking around with Darth Maul heading off in the other direction while Darth Vader roams around too.  It really has a lot of charm to it.\nAnyways, here's a short list of pros and cons because I know people generally don't want to read a wall of text:\n\nPros:\nGood Star Wars music\nFun levels\nFantastic co-op\nFree play mode allows you to revisit levels, break lore, and uncover more content\nGood for kids and adults\nProbably the best LEGO game\n\nCons:\nSome ship levels have really awkward controls\nGeneral character movement might take awhile to get used to\nGamepad is highly recommended, would not play with M+K\nGraphics can be a mixed bag (aged well in some levels, horribly in others)\n\nNotes:\nMight be too easy for some\nHumor might not appeal to everyone\nGame skips some semi-relevant plot details (assumes you've seen the movies, don't play if you haven't seen the movies or you'll just be confused)\nNo voice acting, humor is very visual","February 7","true","28.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's replayibility is something special as well, in just one playthrough of the game you play each level at least twice and becasue each run through of the level is quite different it doesnt drag on at all, and not only that but I've played this game before both on my xbox, my ds and playstation and yet playing it again now on steam makes it all seem like a brand new experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_technus/recommended/32440/","the_technus","George W. Bush","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_technus/","312 products in account","TL;DR: A great nostalgia trip for Lego and/or Star Wars fans, but rough around the edges and it shows.\n\nI had the original two Lego Star wars games for Gamecube way back in the day. I played and enjoyed the hell out of both of them. So you can imagine my excitement when I realized that I could play both, in one game, on PC. I picked this title up in the winter sale and I've been playing it off and on since then.\n\nIt's just as fun as I remember it. The absence of their cringeworthy dialogue and forced love story make the prequels much more enjoyable, though it might be hard to understand if you don't already know the plot. The slapstick and Lego dismemberment gags never get old. There's easter eggs hidden everywhere, encouraging exploration, and the game's puzzles are challenging and rewarding enough to solve for players of any age without getting frustrating (most of the time).\n\nYou can play as all your favorite characters, along with many others whose names you never knew and never really cared about, like Grand Moff Tarkin or Ki-Adi-Mundi. Most of the main characters have unique and sometimes hilarious melee animations, like Princess Leia who ♥♥♥♥♥slaps everyone, or Chewbacca who will leap on stormtroopers and rip their arms off (it's all bloodless Lego gore so it's okay for kids, obviously).\n\nHowever, no game is without sin and this one commits quite a few of them.\n\nA lot of the optional characters, especially the blaster-wielding ones, have little differentiation between them besides their general appearance, so you'll probably just end up using Luke Skywalker (Jedi), Boba Fett (grown-up), and Darth Vader most of the game.\n\nThe most glaring flaws are perhaps the myriad of bugs littered throughout the game, from texture, shadow, and Z-ordering glitches (where background meshes pop through foreground ones) to areas where the Lego studs you're supposed to collect (as currency) simply clip through the floor or walls or other decorations and disappear. Since this game was released in 2009, I very much doubt that these issues will ever be resolved.\n\nSome puzzles are far more tedious than challenging; oftentimes the solution is obvious but requires a lot of work simply to make it seem more difficult than it actually is. This is a trap that many otherwise very good puzzle games (like Portal and The Talos Principle) fall into to pad out their runtimes, and I wish it would stop. Some of the optional puzzles have such obscure and nonsensical "solutions" that you're basically just trying to guess what the game designer was thinking.\n\nThere is no brightness slider, so some scenes can become very overblown, especially with the excessively strong bloom shader included in the game. Disabling bloom helps but makes other scenes look much more drab so it's a lose-lose either way. Also, and this is more of a nitpick than anything, but the screen-space reflections on windows and polished floors are inconsistent in resolution, so some are crystal clear while others are horribly pixellated.\n\nOtherwise, the game's graphics have aged about as well as they could have, considering they're rendering a world which is supposed to look like it's made of plastic. I'll have to look at other more recent Lego games and see how they've improved the engine.\n\nHowever, I really, really, really, really hate the third-person camera. This is one of those games that tries a little too hard to imitate cinema: the camera is often either in a fixed position and pans to show the characters, or pans while following a dolly path through the level. There's also the seemingly intentionally added tracking latency, where it takes a second to catch up to movement of your characters. In addition, some of the levels with mandatory platforming sections have preset camera positions which give very poor depth cues, so sometimes you have no idea if you're going to hit the platform you want or if you're going to fall to your death. Put that all together, you end up with a distracting, oftentimes misleading, and sometimes downright sickening visual ride.\n\nYou might be wondering why I'm still recommending this game, even with all these complaints. It's Lego freaking Star Wars, man. This ♥♥♥♥ sells itself.","January 15","true","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was really fun and is honestly most of the reason I know the plot of the movies. (I kinda found them a bit boring when I was a kid).\nNow looking back and playing it again its a bit more dull than how I remember. At the time of this review I had only played through episode 1 and maybe a bit of 2, and it felt like a relaly dated game. The customization felt a bit, "meh" and the combat and overall atmosphere felt repetitive and boring. I'm sure being a kid or a bit younger and playing through this game might obviously give it a different perspective but that is my view on it.\n\nI have to give it around a 7/10 for my current experience. I will play through more of it and maybe change the review for better or worse but.Yeah.","January 24","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This being one of the original ones, is just truly amazing.It takes you through all 6 original episodes of star wars with a lego touch. It is truly fun. I have played the lego star wars games since 2006 and they are still fun. I do find that episodes 1 and 2 are kinda dry with their level design (NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE PREQUEL LEVELS) but episodes 3 and on are really fun.

Instead of two separate games in one bundle, they are truly combined into just one game. For example, you have to be a Stormtrooper to access areas in Episode I, II, and III. It's a joy to be able to purchase this beauty on Steam and play it with a controller. The ability to relive some of my childhood memories with a boost in the graphic quaility is amazing! I always played Lego Star Wars on older TVs, so it feels odd to see it with a 1080p resolution and higher framerate. If you want to play a Star Wars game that has a TON of content and replayability, this is certainly a viable option.There is nothing serious about it! It really is just a playground of Star Wars fun.

Two of these are only useful in Free Play and are never needed urgently.\n\nOne hand can cover movement and two buttons. That leaves two fingers on your other hand that have to be somewhere on the keyboard. The other two that you never need quickly could be put right near them so you can use a third finger and then MOVE one of the others to press the other button should you need it. Or use all four fingers, whichever is easier.\n\nSeriously though, it's a game with incredibly simple controls and so very straightforward, you don't need a mouse or controller to play this game and enjoy it. It sits alongside LEGO Indy 1 and LEGO Batman as the Golden Trio of LEGO games before they started adding the horror that is voice acting in a series that prided itself on mimed slapstick retellings of famous stories.

I'm biased of course, but I think this is a really great game whether you have nostalgia for it or not. For me, now I'm able to relive those blessed afternoons playing this on the WII- "Let me be Darth Vader!" "Stop throwing bombs at me!" "GO FASTER SEBULBAS GETTING AWAY"\n\nIt's a lot easier than I remember it- when I played this as a kid I paid a friend to beat Mustafar for me (he couldnt but still took my money). Now each level is pretty much 20-30 minutes on story mode. The game isnt really a challenge (aside from the bonus levels that ravaged my village when i was a child). I mean, it's sometimes tricky to get the minikits but never infuriating. There are some parts that feel very dated (I'm looking at that cutscene of the Slave 1 "taking off" on Kamino), but in an odd way the small bad parts are endearing. Let's just say you can tell it's aged, but it aged with dignity.\n\nBugwise, it's pretty clean. Good port. The only issues I have are the dumbass controls for p2 (if you don't have a controller) and the friendly AI not dealing damage. That's something I don't remember from back in the day, I remember relying on them to pick off stragglers? Also droidekas are overpowered as hell and it's BS to die twice doing the only lightsaber move that kills them, and also BS because you're basically invincible when you play with them.\n\nWord from the wise, on the Hoth Ice base level with Han and Leia there's a part with a bunch of fans and a little truck that's practically impossible without P2 controlling C3P0, which means you either need to get a friend or grow another arm. That's actually the only gameplay issue I've seen, and I remember it infuriating the hell out of young me.","June 2","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
