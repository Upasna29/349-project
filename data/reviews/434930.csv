This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================GiAnt is a first-person ant simulator from a new solo indie developer.\n\nYou play Adam, an ant who is unfortunately miscategorised as a girl and given the job of a worker ant. The game starts with you attending a brief session at ant school before "The Captain" sends you out into the world to collect candy. Outside of the nest you need to avoid other insects and spiders while you explore and collect enough candy to be allowed back into the nest.\n\nUnfortunately I'm not sure what happens after that, as in over an hour of play I didn't manage to collect any more than two pieces of candy before the game crashed or I fell afoul of the aforementioned other insects and spiders.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - Graphics are a very mixed bag. Ant models are nice and have a bit of character, and the nest is sort of good in a cute way. Once you venture outside, though, you'll see the graphics really start to shine, with a great blurry effect put to fantastic effect on everything beyond a certain distance away. When you stop and look at it, it's really very impressive.\n\nUnfortunately, when you move there are some weird texture distortions and flickering, and shadows tend to flicker in and out in some areas as well. Couple that with some variable-quality close-up models and scenery, and a general lack of activity and feeling of emptiness in the game world, and after the first "Wow!" moment, I rapidly found myself much less impressed. The sprinkler, too, is terrible, and I still can't work out how a blowfly is hurting me! The cubist reflections in the kitchen cupboards are pretty weird as well (see the screenshot in my profile).\n\nThe UI is mostly good, although the use of a default Unity UI font for the candy and lives counters looks very out of place. Loading screens, too, are pretty terrible: just a plain black background and two-tone grey bar in the middle of it that fills up as the next area loads. It's disappointing and quite jarring, taking away from the immersion of the game.\n\nGraphics options are fairly straightforward and offer a fair bit of choice for optimisation for lower-power systems.\n\nSound - Sound is fairly minimal, but okay. The lack of any consistent background music or audible environmental sounds makes the world feel even more empty sometimes, but triggers for music and some world interactions kick off some interesting changes.\n\nThe game includes voice for the ants. This is mostly well done, although the "Ow!" sounds get a bit painful to listen to over and over again. Similarly, the annoying high-pitched spider sounds and buzzing of the flies when they're near are too loud and grating.\n\nThere are no sound options to adjust volume of music, environmental sounds, and voices, and the mix is a little off, making it impossible to get the right volume all the time. I missed a fair bit of the speech due to nearby insect sounds or a sudden musical trigger, and environmental sounds (except for other insects) would be good if they were a bit louder. These should all be separately adjustable for user preference.\n\nGameplay - The game plays like any other first-person game: WASD for movement, space to jump, and mouse to look around. You're unable to attack or defend yourself, or even interact with the environment, though, so you'll not be needing mouse buttons any time soon.\n\nThe aim of the game is to wander around collecting candy, which you locate on the minimap (sorry, "Antdar") in the bottom right. It's not always reliable, though, as the map is in 2D, whereas the candy can be above or below you as well.\n\nAs you explore you'll encounter (overly) aggressive flying insects (that look like blowflies) and spiders, as well as other creatures on occasion as well. Other ants will talk to you, while environmental creatures will just ignore your passing.\n\nThe game also includes powerups, but these aren't explained and they don't seem to do anything except to add some green misty stuff to the area directly around them for a short time. When I collected one once it seemed to scare a hostile insect away, but the next time it did no such thing and I was killed while walking into and out of the powerup trigger.\n\nHostile spiders and insects are annoying and have extremely poor AI: they just make a bee line (haha) for you all the time and keep following around until they've killed you. There's no way to fight them off or escape, especially since the powerups seem to do nothing the majority of the time.\n\nTo make matters worse, the game plays like a typical gravity-based FPS, completely ignoring the fact that you're an ant and should be able to climb pretty much anything. The best example of this is probably the candy that's 'hidden' at the top of the tree under which your nest is located. Rather than just running up the tree, you have to find a weird walkway that seems to be made of timber boards running up and around the tree like a corkscrew, but even that is on an angle and you'll find yourself getting stuck between it and the tree as your ant insists on staying perfectly horizontal. It's a real shame and is probably the biggest problem with the game, as it completely ruins the suspension of disbelief.\n\nIt's very easy to become stuck on the terrain, and there are some crazy clipping issues as well, making it possible for you to walk through some stones and then become stuck between them and other terrain.\n\nFinally, there are a number of little niggling problems:\n- poor writing in the small amount of text that's included (the wrong 'their', 'occational')\n- the game often crashes if you minimise it while playing\n- there are no visual damage indicators when you're being attacked, so if you've turned down the annoying sound when insects are chasing you, you'll often be killed before you realise it\n- sometimes the game doesn't realise when you've died, so you have to quit to the main menu and restart to try again\n- the ant bridge mentioned as a cool feature is really just a static part of the map (see my screenshot), rather than a cool dynamic feature of ants helping you\n- the Steam page says it has achievements, but it doesn't seem to (at least not yet)\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ very impressive 'long range' graphical effects (esp. outside)\n+ creative use of size differences\n+ mostly entertaining voices\n+ an interesting idea, by a solo developer\n\nCons (see above for more):\n- you're an ant, but you're stuck on the ground and can't climb anything\n- poor enemy AI that just doesn't give up\n- a lot of terrain and graphics problems\n- some annoying sounds and no volume options\n- a very empty-feeling world that's just not much fun to explore\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================I'm sad that I can't bring myself to recommend GiAnt. I wanted to love it, and for the first few minutes I did. But after that all of the game's faults started to appear, and there are many.\n\nWith a little bit of work, GiAnt could be a great game, and if it were in Early Access I would probably recommend it. But it's now been released and it shouldn't have been; it's unfinished and it needs a fair bit of work to reach its potential.\n","May 20","false","1.5"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","2"

I paid 9$ for this, and it's just not good. The idea is funny, and I get that it's a SUPER indie game, but man... Don't put yourself through this. Game crashed several times, couldn't even run it on windowed, PLUS I couldn't climb the pipe you're supposed to climb to enter the house and go on the ant bridge. I kept sprinting, but it just wouldn't make it.\n\nCan I do better? Hell no, but would I try to do anything like this and SELL IT? HELL NO. I would give it out for free, since there are WAY better games to spend 9$ on. Really disappointed with my purchase. In the future, try to make a game that's actually worth the money you're asking.\n\nCheers.","May 25","false","0.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I cringed quite a bit when I was caught by the big spider accompanied by the violin music. If you are on the fence about getting this game, buy it.\n\nNote to dev: I'm actually so confused. I got 5 candy pieces, just looking for the 6th. I think it's supposed to be by the seeds with the chicken based on the dialogue saying that there is one there but there's no candy. I'm baffled.\n\nOH AND ONE MORE THING. Change "Lives" to "Health" or "HP" or add a health bar or something. When you lose a life in a video game, you die. You don't get closer to dying.","May 20","true","4.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","6","14","2","2"
