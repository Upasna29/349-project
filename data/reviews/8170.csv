Go for it. oh and when I say, undetected, I mean, undetected, no crappy little green blob of where you are under the water (I mean why the hell would you do that?)\n\nWant to play as an aircraft carrier launch your plane then take direct control and fly it around shooting down other planes or perhaps launch a torpedo at an enemy ship with the plane? Go for it.\n\nOr do you prefer going as a destroyer and being the only one able to detect submerged subs at a safe enough distance?\nMaybe you prefer the RTS view and just to tell them where to go from a top down perspective?\n\nThis game absolutely killed a year of my life when I was 19 when I had it on the 360.

Let's start with a few things people usually ask me about this game, assuming people already know the mechanics of this game.\n\nIs it a good WWII naval warfare game? Not extremely good, it's enjoyable. There is a distinct difference between the two campaign and each campaign can take a pretty lengthy time to finish. Nothing feels that much repetitive except maybe shooting down a seemingly infinite amount of incoming planes in certain missions.\n\nIs it realistic? No, back then when it was first released it was marketed as an 'authentic' experience, doesn't mean it's realistic but you do get the feeling that you are in control of a giant battleship, an intimidating bomber, a sleek fighter, and all the other units in the game. It's personally just a pet peeve of mine but real naval battles of world war 2 would take hours to days to finish, with ships exchanging shells from tens of kilometers away. In this game, 3 kilometers is apparently too far for a 460 mm cannon\n\nDoes it age well? No and yes, the lack of support for this game makes it impossible to do online multiplayer, however you can expand your singleplayer experience with various mods. It's a shame because the multiplayer component was a damn great fun. And yes, the game can still look pretty beautiful at certain lighting angles, not much to say because at least 90% of the landscape is water, nothing particularly special.\n\nIs it 'fun'? Depends, some missions can be pretty harsh at times and require fast reflexes to effectively give commands and switch between your available units in higher difficulties. They are not incredibly frustating and you never feel cheated by the AI. But those lucky AI shots that crippled my engine, blew up my ammo storage, and set my deck on fire? They are pretty annoying, yeah, but all is fair, because my torpedo bomber blew up a hole in their hull big enough for water to flood in and make the ship list so bad that she can't use her cannons.\n\nShould you buy it? Yes and no, if you are desperate for some naval warfare action where you are in control of the units instead of just a strategy game where you watch ships blow each other up, sure. Otherwise no, unless it's on sale\n","October 2, 2014","true","13.5"," 75 of 83 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","75","83","7","3"

The campaigns can be slightly repetitive... but I spend 90% of my time on the Island Capture. It's a stregetic Civilization V type domination mode. I reccomend for anyone who likes WW2 ship combat with the perfect mix of strategy in there too. The aircraft combat/ movements are simplified, but it is not that much of a problem. I've found I can still enjoy it perfectly. It fits just fine; the ship combat is the main focus.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/planetexpress/recommended/8170/","planetexpress","Ploonoot Exproos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/planetexpress/","153 products in account","Extremely fun naval warfare, fairly well done campaigns that lets you play as both Allied forces and IJN, as well as a good variety of Skirmish maps and modes.\n\nIsland capture mode can keep you busy and having fun for hours, with a huge variety of units and tactics available-  you can build up a sizeabe fleet and wrest control of Islands by way of LST's and Cargo ships, or parachuting units in by air. The naval battles themselves are intense with visual damage and listing to ships that have suffered heavy barrages, and some of that damage remains even after repairing which adds a nice touch of immersion.\n\nWhereas Duel, Escort and Siege modes are more to the point fixed objective modes that have a nice degree of variety to them, including outright 4v4 Battleship duels, destroying an anchored fleet in a Ohka suicide rocket, various naval and air escort missions,\n\nThe overall amount of freedom you get in Island Capture mode allows you to sort of make your own scenarios as well, such as spawning a ton of Cargo and LST ships and a small destroyer escort and try to make it all the way across to the other side of the map against a Veteran AI - guaranteed fun.\n\nIf you like the naval warfare in Battlefield 1942 - especially on Midway Island, then its a sure bet you will like this game, only the naval battles and air battles are much larger in scope and scale. There really is no other game in the world like Pacific or Midway, just like there is no other game in the world like Battlefield 1942 with its true actual naval air and land warfare, so its a unique game in that respect.\n\nFurthermore there is a dedicated and passionate modding community, that despite zero officially released mod tools or support, has managed to create a few dozen mods of all types, extra command points, retextures, realism mods, overhauls, etc. And they are still working on newer versions, it has one of the most dedicated yet small modding communities you will ever encounter.\n\nNow onto the really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part - the developers are no more and all of the three DLC's they made were only available on Games for Windows Live, which is also dead now. On one hand we can rejoice that GFWL is dead, yet on the other, the geniuses at Eidos/Squeenix decided to only give GFWL PC Marketplace the DLC's (two map packs and one unit pack with 3 units- including the Montana Class Battleship). So now that GFWL is dead and the developers have also been axed, there is no way to purchase or otherwise obtain these additional maps and units, which is a serious error on Squeenix's part.\n\nI don't know why the DLC's aren't available on Steam yet even though the game is, I would at this point happily pay to buy all three of them even though the developers and the IP are now gone because the Battlestations franchise does not deserve the fate its been given, its incredibly frustrating to want and purchase content for a game that should have been there anyways and yet to find now that its no longer available. It would be really nice if Steam somehow acquired those DLC's and brought them back for sale.","January 10, 2014","true","104.0"," 52 of 56 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","52","56","0","0"

Midway was a great game but it didn't have a high replayability. You could go through the campaign a few times and collect achievements or spend some time on the multiplayer but it felt pretty sparse in options. It may have been because I played Midway on the Xbox, but after about 70 or so total hours of playing it got fairly boring.\n\nAlong comes Pacific and ups the ante. You now have the option to play through the Japanese perspectives of the Pacific campaign, alongside the Americans, a skirmish mode with quite a few game types, and more multiplayer options (unfortunately multiplayer is dead for Midway due to the Gamespy servers closing however people are still able to play Pacific online).\n\nThe addition of new units, a special unit unlock system, and new nose art are also worthy mentions.\n\nI will also note that you may encounter issues with Games for Windows Live. In order to play Pacific you need to have a Microsoft account. You may have problems activating your code, signing in or even starting the game.\n\nOverall in the time I've played, its a great game. I'd highly recommend it to any history buff or anyone who wants to try something new that has a little dab of strategy alongside action. For the current price, I don't see why you wouldn't buy it. I would consider playing Midway first, it will help you get acquainted with the story if you aren't familiar with the Pacific campaign during World War 2, you'll enter Pacific hopefully looking for more, and its like 7 bucks so why not?","August 16, 2014","true","52.8"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","0"

I usually play RTS games and action games and I am also interested in naval combat as well so this game fits me pretty well.\n\nThe game looks great and sounds great as well. Every ship and plane model is very detailed and every ship that is capable of firing artillery sounds powerful, especially the Iowa-class battleship. The music lively and bombastic, it reminds me a bit of the music from Silent Hunter 4. Some people say the voice acting is horrible but I'm not bothered by it. It's not the worst voice acting I've heard but it's not the best I've heard either. There are some missions that are slower than others, only allowing you control specific units until certain objectives are completed during a mission but there are other missions that allow you to control any unit given to you.\n\nSome campaign missions can be 30 minutes or up to an hour long, depending on the player's playstyle. Plus, unlockable ships and planes can be obtained from completing hidden objectives in campaign missions. These unlocks can be used in any mission that will allow it and they can be used in missions you've already played, which makes for great replay value. Powerful ships like the Iowa-class battleship and planes like the TBM Avenger which can launch powerful anti-ship rockets can make missions you've played before a bit easier and more fun.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game to play. I got it for a much lower price than it was first released. It's about $10 so I think it's quite a bargain.","March 14, 2014","true","82.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

The storyline of course following American and Japanese confrontations in WW2 does the old black and white cinematic whenever explaining stories. The campaigns are decent but can be found repetitive after a while.\n\nThe ability to switch between boat and plane though is greatly appreciated, as it was one of the main reasons why I bought this game. I like to support games that give more options and more control (especially first/third person control) over any unit that belongs to you on the map. There exists abilities to change what types of weapons you use, from machine guns to bombs. During spawn, players are able to choose what type of bomb they wish to carry (on certain air crafts of course). Boats also have the abilities to launch torpedos, artillery, and of course their choice of machine guns.  The handling of both boats and planes are quite decent. At first they feel slightly awkward due to the camera possibilities (and the ability to hold RB on an xbox controller to check where you've dropped your bomb - or hold RT after dropping the bomb to see where it goes). What is good though is you are able to do your bombing run and the game gives you feedback (on your target sights) whether you hit the target or not. If the player presses select, they are able to bring up a big map and are able to issue orders to local squadrons and instruct them where to go or attack. Certain maps you are able to choose to be an airplane or a boat. The auto firing is okay at times but it is sort of annoying not being able to fire things all at once on your own. The need for auto firing seems reasonable, however I would of liked ot see a better key or controller layout to fire what you want to fire.\n\nVisually the game is decent (xbox 360 quality - or toys soldiers sort of graphics). Graphics do not pose a problem.\n\nI've had a few crash issues where the game just shuts down, not exactly sure why I'll try to follow-up with an edit in the future.\n\nI would recommend this game if it appeals to you, but there isn't much else than what you see on the videos. The game types from siege to assault are good, but again they all sort of feel the same. I wish you could land on carriers or were given a bit more planes and boats to start with instead of playing a long campaign (with some difficult challenges may I add).\n\nEven though recommended, I feel the true score here is\n\n\nRATING : 6.85/10.\n\n\nGameplay	C+	Story / Campaign	B-	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	C+","February 13, 2015","true","4.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

The gameplay is great, if you are into this sort of thing, and as long as you have 64 bit java, you can run the highest resolution with no problem. It is at least 95% historically accurate as far as I've seen. The only bad thing is when it rains in the game, (level 2 of US campain) the game DROPS fps to like 10-3. It is a step up from its predecessor, Battlestations Midway, although I recommend that as well.

You take control of a ship or plane and take the fight right to the enemy. You can take control of a PT Boat and fight off air planes, or take control of the legendary USS Enterprise and launch planes to attack your enemy. With the map, you can take control of planes or ships and tell them to move or attack. At that point, you can forget about them and continue with other things. You have two campaigns with the Japanese or USA. There are tutorials, but they don't tell you really how to play. You get four different tutorials, two for each nation. Two for planes for both sides, two for their ships. After that AND the campaign, there are skirmishs and such. There is also Multiplayer, so you can play with your friends.\n\n+Great gameplay\n+You can play it as a RTS as well.\n+Use some of history's most legendary ships, such as the USS Enterprise and even the Yamato for a section.\n+Multiplayer function, with a variety of different modes.\n+Decendly long campaign that kept me in it for over 12 hours.\n+Is decendly cheap, and its prequal, Battlesations Midway, is also great in its own right.\n-Requires Games for Windows Live.\n\nAll in all, I give this game a 9/10.

I loved how it played. The ships looked awesome and felt powerful. The planes looked awesome and performed like they should. But above all, you could be anything. A submarine? A plane? A flotilla of ships? All yours to command. It even had a light RTS element for those who like to sit an watch. This game had everything for a history buff like me, at least until the disc gathered an ungodly amount of scratches. All these years later, I decided to get the version on steam and relive a bit of my childhood, only to dicover you have to jump through a few hoops to get it running (seriously, WHY is the now defunct Games for Windows Live necessary to run this game?!?).\n\nOnce I did get it running, I discovered time had not been kind to it. The graphics (especially on the ships) were very muddy and lacked detail. Battles became tedious with how long they took and how slowly the ships moved. The naval cannons (especially on the Yamato) lacked punch and was brought down with poor sound design. There is also a lack of ships in general, featuring mainly the Americans and the Japanese, with only a handfull of ship types within them as well. The voice acting is BAD and the missions, the Japanese ones (intentionally) being the most outstanding, aren't very historically accurate. The planes have a wonky control scheme with no way to invert the controls, that I've found. In short, it wasn't what I remember it being.\n\nI will grant you that this game and it's predecessor are very unique and have yet to be emulated, but when compared to other similar games, like Wargaming's World of Warships, it just doesn't hold up (tech-wise, at least. Wargaming's increasingly expensive free-to-play model and some of the players themselves are a different story entirely). Unless you're a very nostagic person like myself, I personally cannot recommend this game to anyone else. If you want a fix of naval combat, I cautiously recommend World of Warships if you enjoy MMOs, but as already mentioned, it isn't without it's share of problems. Good luck and fair seas, Captains!","February 3","false","14.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The single player missions range from a mini-sub attack on Sydney Harbour, through to full fleet invasions involving multiple aircraft carriers and associated battlegroups.  There is slightly more emphasis on flight compared to the previous title.  There are some artefacts that creep in to illustrate that this is a console port, the ship guns now autocompute range and lead, but this is offset by the ships now having subtargets (fuel, engine, magazne, etc) that you can aim for.  The control scheme isn't as good as the previous native title, but it is passable.  The only really annoying oversight is that there is no way to assign aircraft rudder to the twist action of a joystick.  There are some interesting new units, the kaiten torpedo (plays like a manually guided torp), the LSM(R), Ohka (kamikazi rocket bomb).","December 18, 2010","true","83.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Contrary to Midway, I had lots of fun with this game! Graphics, controls, sounds and especially, the gameplay were all worked upon and for once, I played a great sequel! Pacific offers you two campaigns (US and Japan) sides of the Pacific war. While the US war was predictable and taken from history books, I've really enjoyed the "WHAT-IF" scenario of Japan's side if they'd actually won their battles in WW2.\n\nPROS:\n+Good gameplay! Played with the Xbox 360 Gamepad mostly, as the controls were tight with it. The keyboard and mouse are serviceable but I'd recommend playing with a gamepad instead.\n+"WHAT-IF" scenario if Japan had won their battles on WW2.\n+Switching from controlling planes to ships to submarines never gets old!\n+Actual combat is pretty fun.\n+Impressive visuals (Graphics, models).\n+Lenghty campaigns. Can provide you with at least a good 20 hours of playtime.\n\nCONS:\n-Game For Windows Live DRM\n-Voice acting (both US and Japan) are quite weak. Many clichés from B-series movies!\n-Low quality cutscene footage with annoyingly voiceover.\n-Some mission can be tedious and very long to complete. (Difficulty spike on many Japanese missions.)\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nYes, I do recommend this game especially to anyone loving WWII setting! While it may not be perfect, it is a decent blend of action and strategy and to this day, I don't find many games that can offer you the chance to be playing with a huge Battleship! Just sad the developer got shutdown so another sequel doesn't seem very likely, unfortunately.\n\nRATING:\n7.5 / 10","January 19, 2014","true","19.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Whether you're fighting in air to air combat, air to sea, sea to sea, sea to air, or commanding your fleet. This game will almost always keep you coming back for more.\nHowever, on the multiplayer note, it uses Microsoft Live, which is in it's own a huge mess.

Windows Live should NOT be FORCED on the PC, for this kinda bull****. I have played this game on Xbox, and all I can say is that it is a very good game. I saw the mods, etc, on the PC so i went out and bought it, and OH LOOK! I need Windows Live to play. Just like Bulletstorm, which I was going to buy, you  need a f****ng Windows Live account. I expect this kind of thing on Xbox where you need to pay to play online and that sort of thing, but this is a bloody PC, it is an open platform, older games like this and Bulletstorm should not be something that is now complicated to play. Don't waste 9$ on this, however, if you are looking to play a Battlestations game, go buy Battlestations Midway, that is able to be played on here and it is just as fun too. So There is that. However, I am getting a laptop soon that will have Windows 10 on it, because I currently write this review with Windows 8.1 on a desktop (not like it matters if written on a desktop or laptop but i'm just throwing that out there) and I will change it if I install this game on the laptop and see if it is fixed, maybe having Windows 8.1 is this whole issue, but I don't know. As of right now with this review, I am sticking with it until I see that WIndows 10 is not like this, or the same. I hope this helped in some way, good day to all who wanna buy this game.\n\nCorrect me if anything I said was not accurate.","December 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","2"

And this is one of my favoriate due to the fact the game is actually challenging ! A lot of world war 2 games are not that difficult... the only games I remember considered as challeging are hearts of iron 3, return to castle wolfestein 3d(highest difficulty level), Call of duty 2 (highest difficulty level), and red orchestra 2( although I have screen shot of me slaugthering 92 people in the multiplayer mode, it is still some times difficult). And this game is one of them if you play it as veteran level.\n\nIf you want to play this game as casual, just select rookie or regular difficulty which will help you a lot if you are new to the game. Although the game is awesome (and if you don't buy this game... you will actually REGRET IT) plane control is bit off if you are playing with your mouse. So, I highly recommend you to buy a xbox controller for more immersive experiences.\n\nTip: When you are making the windows live account use your hotmail account... makes everything a lot easier !\n\n\nIf you are still not convinced by my review... well you can produce kamikaze in this game and ram into ships !\n\nWell if you are still not hyped about this game after hearing the fact you can actually kamikaze into ships...

You get to command your own fleet in RTS mode and also 3rd person mode. The game provide all kind of planes, ships, submarine from WWII including the experimental one. The campaign is slightly a letdown due to the lack of story and horrible Japanese voice acting but you can change the history by winning Battle of Midway and occupy Hawaii as the Imperial Japanese Navy even reaching San Francisco. Graphics is fantastic for its time but the ships lack damagae model (slightly a bit of let down). Even though you can play this game in 3rd person view but strategy is still the main factor in order to win naval battle which is make this game awesome. You can be the best plane pilot in the entire world but you won't last long in one plane when try to dive bomb a carrier group under heavy flak. Every single type of ship have its niche in the sea. Destroyer small but carry deadly torpedo that can sunk any kind of ship including carriers. Battleship heavy gun punch through anykind of armor. And submarine is the deadly underwater assassin that always waiting for you. OVerall this game deserve much more praise than average score on Metacritics. My final Verdict for this game is a 9/10 (Must own)\n\nIf you have problem launching the game just install Games for Windows Live and then disable it later with disabler from Nexusmod\n\n","April 25, 2015","true","51.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Hell no, but it is good for the age of it and will tie anyone over intill War Thunder gets ships. Also dont play for mods. Seriously they add nothing.

And this is one of my favoriate due to the fact the game is actually challenging ! A lot of world war 2 games are not that difficult... the only games I remember considered as challeging are hearts of iron 3, return to castle wolfestein 3d(highest difficulty level), Call of duty 2 (highest difficulty level), and red orchestra 2( although I have screen shot of me slaugthering 92 people in the multiplayer mode, it is still some times difficult). And this game is one of them if you play it as veteran level.\n\nIf you want to play this game as casual, just select rookie or regular difficulty which will help you a lot if you are new to the game. Although the game is awesome (and if you don't buy this game... you will actually REGRET IT) plane control is bit off if you are playing with your mouse. So, I highly recommend you to buy a xbox controller for more immersive experiences.\n\nTip: When you are making the windows live account use your hotmail account... makes everything a lot easier !\n\n\nIf you are still not convinced by my review... well you can produce kamikaze in this game and ram into ships !\n\nWell if you are still not hyped about this game after hearing the fact you can actually kamikaze into ships...

It is better the Battlestations Midway by a very long shot and Midway is the second best I really enjoyed and played all the time.\n\nBattlestations Pacific has a nice strategic map overview and you can handle aircraft, ships and other units by that map. Take over islands by huge ship battles or lose islands by paratroopers catching you off guard. Purchase major battleships and take them into action yourself. The campaign is difficult and it is suppose to be. Depending on the difficulty, you might have more than one objective for maybe one unit they supplied you with. It is really a great strategic game.\n\nI always played the skirmish more than anything with friends. Multiplayer is great and won't disappoint. Battles last a very long time, especially when doing island capture objective mode. I think the largest game I had was almost 8 hours long. They did not disappoint when Battlestations Pacific released and I was urging to get it once I found out they released another.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone (like always) who loves war games like these. Doesn't come close to the same old WWII fps shooters that have been made a million times!","September 22, 2014","true","4.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","1"

Like most games that try to blend well defined genres, Battlestations: Pacific does not exactly shine in any of these.\nThe RTS component is slow and is presented in such a way as to make combat situations difficult. Watch as your ships inch their way toward the enemy fleet, having nothing but the cannon fire of the selected ship letting you know that the ships are, in fact, shooting back at the enemy. Bite your nails in anticipation as torpedoes casually plough through the water like they're on Sunday stroll in Torpedo Paradise. Whoop in joy as the torpedo connects with the front of the enemy ship, then catch your face as it falls as the torpedo continues on its merry way, and you realize that the ships are apparently smaller than what the RTS models show. Pull your hair out in frustration as you try to find or quickly swap to a specific unit in your vast army. Panic as the folorn cry of one of the many similar sounding airman alerts you that he is under attack. Seriously. Except for a red arrow and that alert, there's no way to know if one of your units has started combat, if that unit is not currently selected. Apparently, war is silent except for the unit whose model the commander is looking at back in the war room.\nPlanes slam into each other with annoying frequency, even when on their way to their destinations as squadron pilots fail to think in 3D. Five PT boats could lay out a massive volley of torpedoes that is fully capable of blowing a battleship up. Seriously, if shooting a minigun is like God taking a fistful of bullets and throwing them at your enemy, then a few PT boats is like the minigun that shoots torpedoes.\n\nSo why the thunbs up? Well, if you bear in mind that it is neither a simulator nor an RTS game, Battlestations: Pacific bears up rather well. The campaign feels great, with tense moments and moments that makes you wish you had friends so they could see that one awesome moment that is now gone forever. Both sides of the campaign are just that - both sides - not 'that other campaign all over again but with different colors'.\n\nBut people play these games not for the campaign, so let's talk about the skirmishes (multiplayer, for those of you freaks who actually have friends). Points are shared between players on the same team, so not only is a match less hectic, it allows for the army to operate as one, rather than relying on the AI to control every other unit for you. Battles go back and forth as the ball passes from one team to the other, yet do not lead to stalemates and hours-long matches. The AI itself is at least competent at carrying out most tasks.\n\nAt the end of the day, there are better RTS games; there are better air combat games. There might be better naval combat games - those are so hard to come by. But if it's a mix of those genres that you are after, Battlestations: Pacific is worth getting on sale.","February 10, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both the air and water aspects put you into the reigns of the machine allowing you to move and  fire as you wish. The planes feel fun and arcadey as you whizz around upside down and looping around trying to shoot things down or blow up ground targets and quickly change to the next plane when you get shot down. This is good fun as long as you're not looking for a simulation.\n\nThe boats (which include submarines) have an equally arcadey feel as the main artillery guns are automatically adjusted for range. However, the problems with this game tend to start with the boats as shooting artillery is automatically a ranged for you (don't have to lead the target), the torpedoes aren't which make playing as a submarine particularly soul destroying. There's nothing to help adjust for range and even if you do manage to get it on target, the AI tends to have a fairly easy time in avoiding them simply by stopping, turning or speeding on. The marine warfare is often marred by overly long battles as there is no fast foward button that you might get in something like Silent Hunter. Having said that though, the artillery is fun and the guns are limited to side and maximum range to get you to think a little more about positioning.\n\nMy main problem with this game comes in the form of the tactical map. It's awkward, clumsy, slow and you'll be putting in a lot of effort to do the simplist of things. The controls for it are fairly basic, you can order your troops to move, attack and follow. You also have the option (if you have a carrier, airfield or shipyard) to send out planes and ships. If you move them to a position they will automatically attack anything within range (even if you don't want them to, retreating is a difficult thing to get them to do). Unfortuntely, there is no way to automatically rebuild vehicles that get destroyed meaning that you'll often by coming back to your carrier menu to rebuild. While you get the option to change the secondary weapon for the planes, you won't know which ones got shot down that had which secondary weapons (such as torpedoes or bombs) without flicking through each of the living squadrons. There is also no way to set a rally point as far as I could tell which means that once you build your new planes, they will start flying around the carrier uselessly until you tell them otherwise, again, something that will bring you out of the action.\n\nI didn't like the fact that I spent half my time in the tactical map trying to hand hold my minions when I wanted to be playing the hero. Even if I did want to be in the tactical map, there are much more interesting tactical games out there with more options. I looked forward to the missions that took away the control of the tactical map.\n\nI did like the explanations of each battle, the historical information behind each vehicle and the hidden objects (which you get clues for). I enjoyed the idea of being able to jump into something I'm tactically controlling and I liked that the missions were varied and interesting. The game wasn't difficult on the middle difficulty setting. I did have to fiddle around with the game to get it to work on Windows 8.1 but that didn't take more than a quick google search.\n\nAll in all, I wanted to like this game. I gave it 22 hours of my life but in the end the tactical map and the lack of precision with the ships wore away my patience.","February 19, 2015","false","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I been searching and finally found the game, and for a nice price as well. To me this is a major upgrade from Battlestations Midway since BSP featured way more maps to play on. Of Couse it requires LIVE to be installed to run the game and again you can’t buy the DLC that came with the game, but the game is still fun to play. I recommend playing on Windows 7 at the latest Windows operating system as Windows 8 and up your going to have a headache getting LIVE to work right (that is if you can find a Windows 7 operating system) which was a pain, but possible to get it working. Is it worth it? Yes. It’s worth the money and time.

Instead of staring at a map and telling your units what to do, you can take full control of your units, because when you want something done right, ya gotta do it yourself. This adds a lot of fun and visual flair to the game, where you get to see ships firing off at each other in full 3D, and planes bomb and fight each other.\n\nWhenever you look at an RTS game and you are like "Man, that guy is stupid, I wish I could just do it myself!" or "I wish I was in there" (which you probably didn't say), in this game, just select a unit and leave the map screen! You can aim the guns, steer the ship, make a bombing run yourself, shoot down some bad guys, or switch to an escort ship and do a little escorting yourself.\n\nThe game allows you to choose how YOU want to approach a situation based on your resources. Got submarines? Go sink a ship to weaken the attack. Got a bunch of cruisers? Split them up and let 'em at the enemies. Got some aircraft carriers? Well, launch some aircraft, and bomb the hell out of the enemies. It is all up to the player, and unless you take advantage of your set resources, you will lose, but winning can be done any way you want.\n\nAlso, the visuals are a huge step-up from Midway. Instead of boring old ships that shoot boring shells, WE GOT BADASS SHIPS THAT SHOOT BIG EXPLOSIONS, BOOM BOOM MICHEAL BAY!\n\nAlthough this does not follow a set story of characters like Midway did, the campaign is a ton of fun, as I said before, it lets you decide how you strategize with your resources on hand. The story consists of just re-enactments of famous Pacific War battles, or Alternate History battles with Japan. Again, no story, but the banter between characters in the missions are pretty fun to listen to, even though the voice acting is pretty horrible. The music in the game is amazing, it sets the mood perfectly for each battle, and adds much to the tension.\n\nThere are also custom battles, which add a lot of fun too, which you can duke it out with AI on battles, Island capture is especially fun. There is multiplayer, but players play on it once on a blue moon on Friday the 13th. If you have some friends to get together and play with, however, it can work.\n\nAnyways, this is a great RTS, and a must have for fans of the series.\n8/10","April 6","true","63.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
