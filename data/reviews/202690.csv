Yes please! It's kind of like a combination of the Paradox titles and Total War, which, in my book, makes a winner. What we see here, are the very beginnings of the future of strategy games. This is a must have for all strategy fans and history buffs. Innovative and truly unique, Hegemony is developed by a small developer with limited funding, and sometimes it shows, but really, I cannot recommend this enough.","November 29, 2013","true","40.0"," 80 of 84 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","80","84","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopoopoopoo/recommended/202690/","poopoopoopoo","forsan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopoopoopoo/","623 products in account","An interesting real time strategy game. You are Phillip conquering the city states of Greece to create your Hegemony. It is certainly a game that shows the trouble of directly maintaining a large empire. In the beginning, you only control a few cities which means it is easy to micromanage your troops. The map is very large, consisting of hundreds of cities, that you most likely need to capture to win.\n\nThe big issue in this game is logistics. Troops need food, cities need supply lines with other cities and farms for food. You need supply lines to mines to secure income. There is no way to conquer the map with just one army. Troops need to resupply and replenish. Philip starts out surrounded by enemies around him. Expanding too fast in one direction will leave you overstretched.\n\nSome cities are very bothersome to invade. No farmland to sustain your armies means you need to either bring workers or sheep to resupply food. When you get there, they seem to have an army far too large for their food to accomodate, and you better hope that you win otherwise you have to assemble the troops again and march all the way across the map to try again.\n\nYou also need to watch that cities don't starve. If you conquered a city and they have no food, they will start to rebel. Ignore it too long, and you have to march troops to reconquer the city. Repeat that a couple dozen times and include a couple Greek powerhouses like Thebes and Athens that will constantly raid your cities.\n\nAnd then there is the whole land of Persia which seems to take up half the map. I haven't reached there yet, so I can't see how hard it will be. It will be a huge pain to muster troops from halfway across Greece to invade though.\n\nBuy this game if you like real time strategy games that start simple and become logistical nightmares as you progress.","December 19, 2013","true","161.5"," 54 of 56 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","54","56","0","0"

Two other campaigns focus on the Peloponnesian war (One as Athens and the other as Sparta). There is also a sandbox mode that lets you play any faction in the game. The scripted campaigns are the most fun.\nCons\n-Graphics are mediocre at best\n-Sandbox is bland - You can build an empire but the AI only reacts to you and rarely takes the initiative.\nOverall 8.5/10 - If the graphics don't bother you then any strategy gamer will really enjoy this game.\nNote - i know it says i only have two hours played, i bought the game from the Developors site before it was on Steam and played that version.","November 29, 2013","true","2.0"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","27","28","0","0"

This is one of the best strategy games i have ever played. It has is problems :AI only raides and not really attack you, AI armies builds are kinda strange and AI does some stupid things like not changing the home of a unit without one. But the scale, the managing of food/units/reserves etc. is extremly fun and satisfying.  Zooming in and out feeling like a real commander, caputering slaves and let them carry food, fighting over flocks of sheep (to be honest that is cool :P) and the biggest plus is the campaign witch you can play on your own pace, you can follow the missions you wanted and in your own order. I just an all out great strategy game like I never seen before. It is a bit dated and part II is coming (Rome still in early acces). Just buy this game, have fun and wait for Rome to go out of early acces and have even more fun. The developpers are also great guys, listining to the community via there own forum and the steamhub, support indie devs and buy this hidden gem!

Not for everyone, and a few (modest) historical liberties have been taken, but it models ancient warfare in a way that feels authentic -- much more so than the Total War series, which it superficially resembles. In fact, the Hegemony series' zoomable realtime map is what CA should have been doing years ago.\n\nThis is a game about operational planning as much as tactics and strategy -- army composition, march order, recon, logistics and timing are essential to victory -- and each region is almost a sort of puzzle to be solved. Approach it as a new kind of challenge, rather than a conventional 4x, and you might be pleasantly surprised.","September 29, 2014","true","18.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Unfortunately, there hasn’t been much marketing investment for the game overtime, though the concept is quite interesting. The game does not split up into a strategic and a battle map respectively, but lets the player scroll into the action from a more abstract point of view.\nThe fact that the player’s army size is limited, there are revolts, supply rules and the player faces at least constant skirmishes with his neighbours constitutes a permanent challenge. However, units gain experience, including the reduction of supply needs and the possibility to provide cities with walls helps the player to control his expanding territory. Furthermore the game is great for people interested in the history of the period.\nThough not overwhelming, graphics are actually lovely and it is definitely worth giving the game a try if you are a strategy gamer.\n","January 2, 2014","true","25.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Played so much. Such Satisfaction. Play as the Persians and change the course of history and utterly destroy those pesky Greeks. Western thought be damed all hail the God KING!!! or Play as Athens and take over Persian anatolia instead of Alexander, maybe play as Sparta and lead the greek armies or stuff up history untterly and play as a tribe living near the Danube river and destory both Greece and Persia. The map is seemless zooming all the way in looking at your capital then zooming out to see the progress of your Hoplites in a battle in seconds. The game looks simple and easy to manage after a few hours of getting the ropes. Which is good, peaceful infact when compaired to Franchises like Paradox or Total war. However don't be fooled, It might seem simple but you will have desk slamming moments if your not prepared to defend against sudden attacks. Horsmen riding in on there dammed horses oh so evily taking out farms just before winter. Before you know it you have a huge food deficit. Your new conquests start rebelling, ohh whats that? (sigh) oh great Athens has arrived on the other side of your empire with 6 ships packed of Hoplites wanting there city back. One of 2 things could happen you laugh gleefully as you mange to wipe out the invaders or..........Laugh gleefully in a few seasons in game taking it all back and Executing all the enemies that surrended to your blood bathed armies. REVENGE!!!! The map is huge with many places ploped in if you know your Greek lore and Mythology with a decent amount of historical facts tossed in for good measure.  With 3 campains and a sandbox mode able to pay as any faction. Some people may complain about the lack of diplomacy but who needs it. Old men talking to old men to form alliances and such is such a drag to the young, fit and ready to campaign hoplites just conquer it all.

In it you must expand your starting kingdom through war and diplomacy. There is also historical campains which start in certain senarios, however I have not played these and therefore will not comment on them.\n\nPros:\n- In this game you have to plan your campains wisely, each season will directly impact food production, which is central to gameplay. The impact of feeding your troops (logistics) really deepens the campain over other strategy games such as total war.\n- The camera can be scrolled in and out to see the larger picture or into great detail. It reminds me of the supreme commander camera.\n- Aestheticly this game has an interesting "board gamey" style, with units lookng like peices on the board. I enjoy this art style as it is unique from other games.\n- The map is huge, and gives players vast areas to conquer.\n- There are small histroy notes scattered throughout the map which help immerse you (and are interesting to history buffs like me).\n- The music is simple but also helps immersion into the ancient greek world.\n\nCons:\n- The diplomacy in this game is very shallow, and boils down to paying your enemies enough so they will stop invading you so you can focus on eating another nation.\n- You will constantly be raided by Athens throughout the entire game, as Athens has naval island bases scattered throughout the greek world. This is not really a con as it gives a difficulty boost to the game, but it can be annoying.\n- The unit diversity is not very high. All the greeks have the same hopilites, barbarians have the same medium cav, thrace has the same peltasts. However, some of the greek factions have hopilites which are stronger in combat, some are stronger at seiges. Thracian petalst are vastly different to greek peltast. Persians have elite heavy cav. You will find the unit diversity to be simple, yet effective.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a very enjoying strategy game which is great for strategy gamers and history gamers. Given that this was developed by a small team, it is remarkable how polished, complete, and high quality it is. 9/10","June 28, 2012","true","111.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It works then.\n\nThis is a great game that is simple in it's concept but difficult to master.  It is "smaller" in scope than the Total War games but has one thing they don't.  When fighting a tactical battle in Hegemony you are actually picking the terrain you will be on.  Unlike Total War where you are picking one of several pre-made tactical layouts.  In Hegemony, you *can* pick your place.\n\nGreat game for a very low price.  Steam should try and support it by at least putting the work arounds as a sticky topic.\n\n\n\nSTEAM read this:   I would buy more expensive games from you but I can't trust that you work.

The game truly captures the feeling of ancient warfare by altering accepted gameplay; For example, building town walls makes occupied cities more likely to rebell and thus requires larger garrissons (why shouldn't they feel more secure and independant behind walls?). They have also shifted the scope of the warfare, from the genre's standard province by province conquest, we now have a methodical, strategic border creep, city by city.\n\nThis game gave me some amazing moments. The most recent from when I first started the Spartan campaign. I felt resonably confident and thus cranked up the difficulty all the way. It started off well, I controlled a single island-city on the Ionian coast, which is perfect for figuring out your surroundings. Yet, I had sufficent numbers of spartan recruits and a large subsidy from home to be comfident. Then I made my biggest mistake, by building more ships and an extra brigade. I was dangerously overstretched and thoughtlessly attacked the closest city on the Athenian-held coast with my hoplites. Unexpectedly, the city was reinforced, my spartans lost and I deep in desperation. I felt just like the Athenians after Sicily.\n\nMy army was rebuilding, yet my manpower was used up by either replacing ships killed when I was't looking or still under construction from my earlier expansion. So, I used my single remaining ship to transport a starting spearman brigade to the south (spearmen are this game´s equivalent of WW2 France). There lay a tiny island city basicly undefended and even my spearman brigade could capture it. It had neither farms nor mines. It didn't matter, I only wanted it's manpower. I thus used it as a naval base, freeing up my spartans for infantry. That is beacause captured cities can only produce mercenaries, which means expensive, second-rate troops. They can still produce ships at the same price and quality - wood is wood and ships are ships.\n\nMy main base was still short on manpower and for the remainder of the year, I had to cower behind my walls as the Athenians burnt my fields. I knew I would take my revenge upon them, yet all I could do was send my spearmen to do the same to them. I knew I would later take that city, fisting my hands. I soon did.","January 5, 2015","true","139.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I also like the historical accurate units and buildings and like. What I do not like is that you fit 40 slaves into a mine, and that is it, any over, you dont get any more income. I dont like that the recruiting is 1.9 or .5 a wk depending on settler size of city, now it maybe historically correct but discounting the national unity and the drive at which philp gave to drive out any invading army is also abismal at best. He recruited on loans of money and patriotism. Now with all that said, I like the mechanic that is used to simulate revolts.\n\nI will say over all that this game is worth cosideration at a lower price due to my dislikes and the fact that there is no real "set mining material to refine" mechanism. I mean you get the locations of mines, but not the products of the mine or the actual costs for the materials. That would make the game more interesting instead of capping mines at 40 slaves to make 80 coins a turn and there is no budget really other than income vs expense so no way to really do anything beyond yearly reports.\n\nI know I am probably being alot more critical of the games than most people but honestly I have done research, quite alot recently, and found that most games dont really want to go into how economies or military actions, etc actually affect the population nor how it affects international diplomacy. I am not knocking the developers by any means. They did a great job of the historical elements. I just hope that they have planned for the new one more units and more economy and more historical events.\n\nA suggestion to the developers for the new game, Add Galleys... Galleys and Gladass were ships that helped most countries rule the Med region for years. I am shocked that you didnt add at least a shortened version for the greek campaigns... Unless you just coupled them with Thrimes. Then I understand.","January 11, 2015","true","34.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

I would define it as an "operational grand strategy game".\n\nThe emphasis is obviously on logistics: the real trick to success is keeping your troops well supplied and in good shape, and that can be hard, especially during sieges and winters. Sieges in particular are rather well represented in a fun way, as you'll need to block enemy supply routes, both on land and on sea, while keeping your own open.\n\nStrategical maneuvering is also very important, and delaying the movement of an army might mean the collapse of your empire. Your state is almost like a house of cards: lose a key region for your supply network and your income, and you'll find yourself in big trouble. The AI itself is very skilled at exploiting those weaknesses in your grand strategy, and you'll find yourself often at war on multiple fronts. Unlike many strategy games, as you grow there won't be any kind of avalanche effect: you will have more resources and more troops but your borders will also be longer, and you'll find out that you can't deploy that many troops in a specific campaign anyway: small and mid-sized kingdom still pose a very tangible threat even when  you're the biggest empire on the map.\n\nThe tactical part is simplistic: it's an RTS at that, but the mechanics are a bit lacking. Also, proper tactical maneuvering is still very important but most of the time you'll find that there isn't a lot of room for maneuvering.\n\nOther than that, this game has a huge plus: the immersion value. It recreates the era pretty well, and to this day I've never seen a more detailed recreation of Ancient Greece in a videogame, with many historical kingdoms and city-states making their appearance in Hegemony and so many missions you have to complete to establish your dominion over Greece. You'll never get bored as you'll always have things to do, and the historical grand campaign lasts many, many hours.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend the game. It's a very original and innovative title, and if you like historical immersion and strategy go for it: you won't be disappointed.\n","April 22","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
