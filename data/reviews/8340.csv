Each episode is very unique. As an adventure game you may find yourself stuck at times. Other times I swore up and down I had done everything then I redid everything and it turned out I didn't.\nIf you like the webseries Homestar runner there's a lot to love here. You learn a lot about the characters and they're each well represented and voiced.\nThe games aren't exactly hard, but more on the average scale. Poking around for missed items and clues will sometimes yield a special item. I don't remember if something special happens when you collect them all but you might get an attaboy. The only collectible quest I really tried on was one with Teen Girl Sqaud because you could make your own TGS comic where you kill them all. They're also voiced.\nIt's not really like Telltales' more recent efforts, it's closer to the Sam & Max series. That probably sums up whether you'll like this series.","December 6, 2013","true","2.5"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","38","41","0","0"

Telltale went all out to assure that the game would perfectly capture the look and feel of a H*R cartoon, and they didn't disappoint.\n\nAlso, don't forget to make a Teen Girl Squad comic.

You control the main character and main icon of the show Strong Bad as you destroy people's days, the Strong Bad way. 5 episodes are made, including the long awaited Dangeresque 3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/8340/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","As I have now actually completed all five episodes of Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People: Season 1, I can give the game a proper review instead of just saying that it's a cool game for attractive people, even though, you know, it kind of is.\n\nFirst of all, we'll get this out of the way: Unless you are a fan of the Homestar Runner universe, there is a probability that you won't enjoy this game. It makes endless references and jokes related to the series that you wouldn't understand unless you've seen some of the episodes in question. That isn't to say that you shouldn't buy it just because you might not understand some of the jokes though, either way this game is extremely funny and the humour is very dry, as you would expect from a game where you're controling Strong Bad.\n\nThis is what you would expect from a typical Telltale Game, it's a (mostly) point and click adventure with clever and satisfying puzzle solving which ultimately turned out to be a lot of fun. The puzzles make sense, the controls are simple (though sometimes a little clunky) and the dialog is hilarious.\nThe gameplay is relatively simple and easy to get into, some mini-games and particular inventory items help to break things up nicely so that it doesn't feel too repetitive. There are a total of five episodes for Season 1, all of which are relatively short but sweet, I'd estimate that they take around an average of 3 hours each to complete.\n\nI really enjoyed my time playing this, and while it may not be to the taste of a number of people, I defintiely recommend it to those of you with a good sense of humour, whether you are a fan of the Homestar Runner series or not, episodes 4 and 5 were particularly excellent and stood out the most to me among the bunch, especially in the humourous department.\n\nLastly, the standard sale price is a little bit steep for the amount of gameplay that the game offers to you overall so I would recommend buying it while it's on sale. Either way, you'll get your share of laughs playing this game.","December 30, 2015","true","4.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Your HUD is simple too, You have your inventory of strange random objects that you pick up along the way, There is some collectables along the way for those who wanna get that 100% completion rating of the game. And just your mouse pointer which helps you choose where to walk, and what to intereact with.\n\nTheres a lot of cut scenes and character interaction, So those who arent familar with the website or the characters, you will learn quickly the personalities of the cast in this game, There are some funny moments and some sneaky comments for the mature audience every now and then, Some dialog will have you laughing or smiling, But all of it will definately keep you entertained.\n\nDuring the course of the game, you're welcome to explore the area as it grows and even play some mini games. I had a lot of fun with creating my own teen girl squad comic, but other mini games exist too. And of course, There are going to be some cryptic puzzles that will have you frustrated, trying every object in your inventory on everything, twice or three times just to be sure. And you'll have puzzles which are clearly given away or hinted by conversation with NPCs.\n\nI bought this game recently, on my wishlist for a very long time because I didnt like the price but I ended up with like 5 episodes. Maybe I didnt read the store page correctly but I'd understand now why its 10 bucks, Im happy to play on and curious to see what happens next, It's highly colourful game and sticks well to the websites trademark look accompanied by it's fun music too...\n\nso if you're a fan of the website, Then the game is clearly a must, however if you're not familar with the site, as I mentioned earlier, You'll still enjoy this game and learn what the cast is all about.\n\nUltimately, It's a point and click adventure and we haven't see a lot of these in a long time, but here's a good one.\n\nGet it.\n","December 20, 2014","true","5.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

I've probably been aware of the Homestar Runner cartoons for at least half my life now so there's already a mild degree of nostalgia here. And Telltale really delivers on the concept; the characters and writing all match well with the cartoons and it's just as funny as ever. I've always liked that comfy spot between "kid humor" and "adult humor" that they found, it doesn't show signs of either's stupidity but keeps the good parts of each, making it humor that basically anyone can enjoy.\n\nAs for the game itself, then. It's a competent point-and-click adventure. The only real moon-logic puzzles are for the optional collectibles, while the main storyline is generally easy to progress with only mild experimentation, and usually the plot guides you in the right direction. Plus there's a hint system if you really get stuck, so the game should easily be completable on its own. I used a guide to look up collectibles but little else. It's certainly fun and clever about what you need to do. The minigames in each episode are also all pretty diverse and interesting; they all bear a degree of stylistic suck and aren't too terribly complex nor difficult but they're worth the 15-20 minutes I tended to spend on them, and a nice diversion from the puzzling and slower pace of the main game.\n\nFor the episodes themselves; it's not really possible to buy them separate I think? But they're all pretty interesting and unique in their own way. The first episode is very straightforward and vanilla and a good introduction to the series. The second's theme is strong as well as inducing plenty an amusing moment, and also contains my favorite of all the minigames (and really the most content in general). The third is a bit weak on the first half but the second half returns to form (plus the music being played is just... special.) The fourth is more linear than the rest but has an entirely different atmosphere that basically necessitates this; it's probably the funniest out of all the episodes too. The fifth also has a strong theme and provides a satisfying finale for the season. Even if they really all have nothing at all to do with each other, since each episode is, like the cartoons, pretty much standalone.\n\nAll in all though I'd highly recommend this for fans of the cartoons and still would consider it worth checking out even if you know nothing about Homestar Runner.","July 3, 2014","true","4.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

If you aren't cool enough to remember it, Homestar Runner was an internet sensation 10+ years ago. A couple brothers and their friends wrote, animated, and voiced what I still consider some of the funniest stuff to ever come to Flash (yes, this was back when entire websites were based in Flash and Youtube was but a glimmer in its father's... "eye"). The humor wasn't for everyone, but it had a totally obsessed following that I'm proud to still be part of.\n\nAnyways, this game (or series of episodic games, rather) is based in the amazing Homestar universe. You play as one of the best jackassy characters of all time: Strong Bad. It's a traditional Telltale-style point-and-click adventure series, and it rocks. Hard.\n\n... At least if you're a fan of the site. I have no idea what an outsider would think, but if you were a fan you will see so many awesome references your head will explode. The graphics, voiceovers, and writing are all spot-on with what you'd want from a Homestar game, and leaves you wanting more. Some say they thought the puzzles were a bit too easy at times, but I felt as though it hit a nice middle ground. Nothing too frustrating, but not boring either. Pretty much your standard Telltale-style adventure game. Quite frankly, the puzzles were a sideline to what the joy of this game is: running around and interacting with some of the best characters of all time!\n\nIf you were a fan of Homestar Runner this is hands down a *must buy* for you! If you weren't, well, check out the site (it's still up) sometime. See if its humor is your style and if so, plunk down a few bucks and enjoy.

In TellTale's case, it would be point-and-click adventure games. These people know how to make a fantastic adventure game with wonderfully designed puzzes and great story execution.\n\nSBCG4AP is based off Homestar Runner, a long running and very entertaining flash cartoon website with a fantastic cast of diverse and easily recognizabe characters. As such, being a fan of Homestar Runner is definitely reccommended for full enjoyment of this game, otherwise you'll probably have no idea what's going on, and in the case of a few of the puzzles where a bit of knowledge about the characters really helps, you might find yourself having a lot of issues.\n\nAs for the puzzles themselves, they seem vary in difficulty from episode to episode. I feel like episode 4 is the easiest, but I don't really know which episode I should consider the hardest. Puzzles in just one episode can also have varied difficulty, meaning they don't just increase in difficulty as the episode goes on. And since this is a Point-and-Click Adventure, that of course means that getting stuck will probably lead to the age old method of trying everything with everything. However, you can turn hints on if you have too much trouble, or if you want to hear additional funny dialogue, whichever works.\n\nThe control is as simple as you would expect in a game like this, point to where you want to go, and click to move there. Hold the mouse to move faster, and while I know you can run, I'm not entirely sure how to get it to work, I think you double-click, but it doesn't always work. Moving to where you want to go can be a bit finicky though when you're on the grassy roundabout for a majority of the game's locations (Bubs' Concession Stand, The Stick, Strong Badia, The Cool Car, The Whale and the like). Your inventory is easy to find and navigate and talking to the other inhabitants of Free Country, USA is as simple as clicking on them and choosing an image from a little chat bubble for your response. Saving your game is easy and in general the game is very streamlined to make playing it simpler and removing a lot of needless menu navigation.\n\nIn terms of the graphics, voice acting and sound, they're all pretty darn good. The character models look like the characters' 2D flash puppets were just taken and rendered into 3D. All of the locations that Homestar Runner fans recognize are here and accounted for, and there are even other references like the Geddup Noise, that painting of a demon holding a torch (why is he holding that torch?), and there's even a minigame in one episode where you can make a Teen Girl Squad comic. The voices are done by The Brothers Chaps and Missy themselves, and they deliver the characters just as they would in the cartoons. And the music is perfectly like the cartoons, and some are just taken directly from them (One for example is specifically taken from "Strong Bad is in Jail Cartoon"). Essentially, they feel like you're playing an hour or so long Homestar Runner cartoon, and it's a joy from beginning to end.\n\nOverall, a fantastic buy for Point-and-Click enthusiasts, especially those who are fans of Homestar Runner, but you might be able to enjoy it just fine even if you aren't a fan.","July 20, 2015","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However where the magic of the genre lies is when clicking a bunch of stuff in the right order propels an interesting, amusing story with entertaining and likeable characters. That is the key element that this game is lacking. I remember when various catchphrases from  the homestar runner website worked their way into the vernacular but I never found any entertainment value in the site so similarly I found little enjoyment in this game. One good thing about this game is that there are little side things to do away from the main plot. However they are all tedious as the rest of the game. So this game is one to avoid try playing Sam and Max, Back to the Future or Wallace and Gromit to see how to do point and click games properly.","July 8, 2012","false","1.6"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","8","24","2","0"

Telltale Games kicked me in the soft spot.\n\nI should have read who the developer was. I might have known better. I've played Sam&Max Season 1 (as much as I could stand) and Wallace and Gromit Episode 1. They all share the telltale marks of a developer who should learn how adventure games work before churning out hundreds of them with random licensed properties attached.\n\nMainly that puzzles in the game should be defined and concluded.\n\nIf you like repeatedly touching every random facet of a pencil to a piece of paper because it always amuses you to discover the tip makes a mark, I recommend this and any other Telltale Games adventure.","November 24, 2010","false","8.2"," 9 of 48 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","9","48","0","2"

The gameplay wouldn't have been affected, and where necessary it could've occasionally switched to a 3D sequence. Other than that, it's just not really as funny as the web cartoons. The dialogue for those is usually short and snappy, and here you get kind of mired in the necessary conversations for adventure game dialogue. A lot of the references to stuff from the web cartoons feel kind of tired. I've been playing it for a while now and after 10-15 minutes I just have to save my game and go do something else for a while.\n\nI will say the adventure game aspect of the game is pretty solid, it can get tricky without becoming frustrating.

Indulge me, if you will, and I will tell you a story.\n\nLong ago, in a land far, far away, I read Hamlet by Shakespeare. When I finished it late at night, I had the strange idea to look it up on steam. Lo and behold, a game existed that was based off of the infamous play for a very reasonable five bucks. It appeared to be a point-and-click adventure game, but that didn't matter to me. It was too odd, too coincidental, for me to pass up. It downloaded quickly, and I began an hour journey of puzzles with no clear answers, walkthroughs, and a very loose interpetation of Hamlet. This is what I have come to expect from point-and-click adventure games. Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People changes the formula to be less... awful. The puzzles in this  make sense.  I know, that's crazy.\n\nAlright, not all of them make sense, but most of them do. I can imagine it being hard to make puzzles that are difficult and coherent, but when it is the norm rather than the exception to have stupidly specific puzzle solutions in games, we've done something wrong. Point-and-click adventure games are notorious for having these sorts of puzzles, and that's because they miss something fundamental in making a puzzle: simplicity. Not simplicity in the answer or in the visual design (although that can help), but simplicity in the tools you are given. Think back to your favorite puzzle game. For a lot of you, it's probably Portal. Portal's central mechanic is deceptively simple; you shoot two portals, and walking into one brings you out of the other. But with that simple central mechanic comes the possibilty of twisting it into new shapes using physics and other, smaller tools and obstacles. Spacechem and Infinifactory are also great puzzle games, and their premise is simple as well. "Make specific things with these tools," the game says to the player, but the creators stretch and mould what it is the player needs to make. This most important of concepts is never used in point-and-click adventure games, but it is in Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive people.\n\nThere are some strangely specific puzzles, but most of them are pretty well done. Part of it is that there is no item combination. In most adventure games, the player is forced to combine everything in their inventory to find the solution to a problem, but Strong Bad eliminates that by removing that facet of gameplay. You just have stuff, and you can use it all with your environment. Many things only work in specific places, but those place also make sense. In Episode 2, for example, ypu get a lighter. Throughout the rest of the episode you can use that lighter on burnable objects. Makes sense, right? I'm glad to finally see a really good adventure game, but it  is  a Telltale game, and this is what they do best.\n\nStrong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People is fun and challengining, and I very much recommend it.","August 28, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though not without its faults, Telltale brings the Bad to life in its usual way: a point & click adventure game. Fans of Telltale's work or Homestar Runner will likely eat the game up. It isn't terribly hard, but it shouldn't have to be. Most of the charm comes from the characters and the world they inhabit, and in the end that's really what many of us are here for.","April 6, 2013","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as the one and only Strong Bad, who you might know as the professional email checker hailing from Free Country USA! Across five episodes you will go on an incredible point-and-click adventure, solving puzzles, collecting items, and talking to people! In my opinion this game is awesome, and you should buy it. ALL of the characters from homestarrunner.com are included, like Larry Palaronchini, Stinkoman, and of course Trogdor the Burninator! You will also visit PLACES like The House of Strong, Bubs' Consession Stand, and Club Technochocolate! That's pretty much all I have to say about this game, so now that you've read this review, go and buy the game!","December 5, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay wouldn't have been affected, and where necessary it could've occasionally switched to a 3D sequence. Other than that, it's just not really as funny as the web cartoons. The dialogue for those is usually short and snappy, and here you get kind of mired in the necessary conversations for adventure game dialogue. A lot of the references to stuff from the web cartoons feel kind of tired. I've been playing it for a while now and after 10-15 minutes I just have to save my game and go do something else for a while.\n\nI will say the adventure game aspect of the game is pretty solid, it can get tricky without becoming frustrating. It's not a bad game series, but a little disappointing.","November 2, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ones with the freakishly overcomplicated simplistic puzzles, and the weird drop down menus that seem to exist on a realm just slightly beyond mortal comprehension? No? Yes? Very yes? If yes, then you came to the right place! sorta...\n\nLong before the other pointy clicky type of popular web series with Home in it's name, or that Walking simulator that's about as amusing as watching paint dry,  there was the Homestar runner, terrific athlete and star of his own web series of pointy clicky type animations. And by "star" I mean co- star. Honestly, even calling Mr. Tights in the hallway a co-star is pushing it. Like, REALLY pushing it.\n\nThe point here, Whatshisface, is that the folks over at TT did a collab with he guys that made That web series quite some times ago. It's full of that special heart healthy brand of clicky pointy action, mixed with the usual type of stuff You've come to excpect from both of them, for better or for worse. There's even games within the games! Lately ol Teetee's been slacking off with their newer releases in some respects, but this one pulls all the stops if you gotta get your strong dosage of bad. and by bad I mean good.
