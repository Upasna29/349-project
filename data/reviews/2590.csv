"http://steamcommunity.com/id/d-turbokiller/recommended/2590/","d-turbokiller","D-TurboKiller","http://steamcommunity.com/id/d-turbokiller/","512 products in account","Alpha Prime is basically an extended tech demo, clocking in at 5 hours of playtime. And oh boy, does it show.\n\nLet me get out the good parts first. As far as tech demos go, it looks pretty, with loads of cool effects on many interiors (outside doesn't look that good), and runs very nicely on my crappy laptop at 1280x800 resolution, except when there's too many particles (my NVidia G105M HATES them), you probably will run this perfectly. Also, ALL cutscenes are in-game, which is definitely a plus for both disk space and cutscene quality (seriously, ♥♥♥♥ those pre-rendered cutscenes).\n...and that's all the good points.\n\nAs for the bad points, well... everything else.\nThe story is not just completely forgettable, it's also accompanied by hilariously bad writing and voice acting. I'll sum it up nicely for you: Miner has to find artifact on Mars-like planet because of ♥♥♥♥♥ ex-girlfriend, shoot many things because CORPORATIONS ARE EVIL (also evil robots for no good reason), ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss fight for the artifact, dead because your ♥♥♥♥♥ was a ♥♥♥♥♥ all along. Seriously. I did not give a single ♥♥♥♥ about the story, except for the hilarious parts, my favorite being Paolo, the Italian with incredibly bad engrish, getting shot in the leg and saying "No! Paolo go nowhere! Paolo is a cripple! Disability pension!". Too bad the game kills him WAY too early, clearly he should've been the protagonist instead.\n\nOh yes, the gameplay. Enemies have perfect accuracy and INSTANT reactions, which makes even Easy a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nightmare. Enjoy sniper shotgunners and exploiting their line-of-sight by leaning or crouching behind things so you become completely invisible to them.\nLiterally none of the weapons are either balanced or enjoyable, and ALL of them have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ damage. The first weapon is a useless hammer, you can attack as fast as you can press the mouse button but you gotta be WAY too close, not to mention every single enemy has a ranged weapon anyway, so good luck not dying. The pistol shoots too damn slow and feels underpowered. The shotgun is one of the worst i've seen in any game, you have to be almost as close as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hammer to do any decent damage (or any damage! Enjoy missing every shot while emptying all 8 shells!). The gatling rifle is the best one, which isn't saying much because it does ♥♥♥♥♥♥ damage and low ammo per clip. The sniper rifle would've been the best gun, had they not ♥♥♥♥ed up the zoom mode so badly that everytime you try to aim it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ chore and you'll miss many shots because of it. Both the rocket launcher and grenades are hilariously bad because you need sniper-like accuracy for it to do any decent damage, because the splash radius is just TINY. And finally the Flamethrower... the worst weapon in the game, yes, even worse than the hammer, you have to be almost as close to anything despite the flame going at least twice the distance for it to do any damage, and what it DOES damage is absolutely pathetic, a mosquito would deal more damage than this.\n\nWhat else? The movement is hilariously broken, especially the jumping. They let you do a floaty jump but if you fall more than 5 meters you're pretty much dead. As for landing the jump itself, it seems to slide off things until it finds the flattest surface possible, it's really weird and it causes weirder deaths because of it. Because stairs are treated like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ramps, I jumped downstairs and INSTANTLY DIED. And don't try to stand still either, because you'll slowly slide down that ♥♥♥♥ like's it's covered in butter. Also beware for anything with physics, it might just kill you, the most hilarious one is getting yourself killed by your own basketball. ON THE GROUND. JUST BECAUSE IT MOVED TOWARDS YOU. And finally, all the models barely look better than the ones on Doom 3, which is clearly what they were trying to mimic (some of them look just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥, too).\n\nBottom line, just... don't bother. Only reason I even got this was because of a bundle. Spare yourself the torture.\n\nEDIT: Steam keeps putting this game on sale (I already regret making this funny), and I'd like to point out a few other things about the game, so here we go.\n\nThis game has a lot of stuff that's so underused and generically/badly thought out, you can seriously tell this was a tech demo from the start and didn't actually evolve past that, they just made it longer.\n\nYou get a hacking device early on in the game that lets you open locked doors and help you out in combat by making certain objects blow up... except sooner than you'd think, you'll never use it again unless you absolutely need to open a door. Zero combat use after a certain point.\n\nYes, you can hack one of those silly remote-controlled box lifters at least twice during the game. Oh boy, just what I was missing from my favorite FPS game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ box puzzles! Good thing I'll never see them again.\n\nDid I mention slow-motion? If you've paid any remote attention to the story, you know that stuff's Hubbardium, which is, you know... the very same reason that made everyone on the planet INSANE? And screw you if you think you deserve a good explanation for that (even in the end, it still doesn't make enough sense), so start pumping that ♥♥♥♥ into your veins and enjoy the orange effect.\n\nAnd finally, yes indeed, you do get to drive a vehicle in one of the final parts of the game, with decent physics to boot (as far as martian-like physics go anyway). But once more, it was badly thought out to the point that you'll only get a brief section of it and never see it again. Come on, split that stuff out evenly.\n\nOh, and since people want to know the fun parts of the game, here's my list of screenshots, containing most of the amusing parts in the game. Enjoy.\n\nSome of Paolo's lines:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217532116\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217532203\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217532274\n\nAmusing moments:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217970931\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217971762\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217982166\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217982489\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=218005034\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=218036842\n\nOdd stuff caused by bugs:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217964657\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217554737\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217972941\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=218003610\n\nBloody hell, this is the most complete review I've ever written now, Hope it was worth your time.","January 20, 2014","false","5.5"," 227 of 281 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","227","281","0","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/2590/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Alpha Prime is a terrible game, and I kind of like it that way.\n\nIt's chock full of awful encounters, you fight the same three enemies the entire game, half the guns are useless and the other half only slightly less so, and levels seem to stretch on endlessly as they blur together. "Balance? To hell with that" you can hear Black Element yell as a barely discernible enemy on the other side of the room head shots you with a shotgun. Elements from other games are unglamorously fitted into parts of the game, like a patchwork quilt of design that's been out of style for years and manages to be significantly worse still than what they were lifted from.\n\nThere do not currently exist words in the English language strong enough to properly describe the true horror that is Alpha Prime's writing, such an elongated mess of horrendous characters, dialogue unfit for a B movie, plot lines thrown out and then just left there, and a bit of casual misogyny thrown in just for flavor. It's agonizing to listen to, stilted voice acting keeping it from even being somewhat amusing, and there is so, so much of it.\n\nAlpha Prime is bad; a masterwork of mediocrity at the best of times. But again...I kind of liked it, maybe because for as miserable as it most certainly is, it's strangely polished in ways that made it kind of endearing if only ever so slightly. It feels like a game that might have been an obscure hit a decade ago, and I guess part of me still enjoys the sort of game that is so unmistakably rubbish, but its developer still clearly put a ton of effort into making it so I'm willing to go along for the ride even as I ask myself what is wrong with me. It's not broken, well, mostly. It's just bland, tedious, uninspired and a posterchild for dreadful videogame writing (though I will definitely be using "total lamers" as an insult).\n\nCan I recommend it? Probably not. Would I play it again? Not on your life! Do I regret playing it? I wouldn't say so.","January 14, 2015","false","5.9"," 53 of 66 people (80%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","80","53","66","14","3"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 6\nAlpha Prime\nPurchase Date: 1/16/2014\n\nAlpha Prime is another game I picked up thanks to a Humble Bundle.  18 months later I am finally getting to check it out.  Turns out I could have waited.\n\nAlpha Prime starts out much like one of those B-movies you expect to see on the Sci-Fi channel, with a bit of a cheesy story and some bad acting.  After listing to a laughably bad impression of a drunk guy, I meet my ex-girlfriend and get an exposition dump to explain the start of the game.  So about the first 10 minutes of my hour long review is spent in the opening cutscenes.\n\nEventually though I end up on a planet and find myself in trouble in no time.  I quickly discover this game has all of the hallmarks of a standard shooter.  It starts me with a crappy melee weapon and slowly but surely I find better weapons to upgrade to.  And it's all the weapons you'd expect to see from pistols, to shotguns, to assault rifles and grenades.\n\nAlong with some rather bad acting and dialogue, everytime I would pick up a weapon, the game would tell me "Picked Pistol".  Not picked up.  I started to feel like I was playing Pokemon.  Pistol, I choose you!  Shotgun, I choose you!\n\nThe enemy AI seemed pretty dumb, although they were all good shots, so it still added some difficulty to the combat.  You definitely want to quick save the game often, as you will be reloading a lot.  But not necessarily because you died in combat.  Once I had to reload because the entire game crashed.  Another time I was crawling through an airduct (another hallmark of a first person shooter), and I somehow managed to crawl through a fan without the game registering a collision.  So I kept crawling through the airduct but then I ran out of level, and fell out of the world.  Some games when you fall out of the world it will 'reset' you to a nearby save spot.  This game just kills you dead.\n\nThe game lets you interact with items in the game, although most of the time it serves no purpose.  There was one time I had to drop a sheet of aluminum over a hole in the floor to run across it.  A few times I opened up air ducts or lockers.  But a lot of objects were just randomly lying around like books or boxes.\n\nMy favorite though was the random basketball I ran across.  Not only that but I found it in a room with a basketball hoop.  I wasted several minutes trying in vain to make a shot.  It's hard to actually throw items in the game.  All you can do is drop things, but if you happen to be moving your mouse as you drop it, you can kind of 'fling' things around.  In the end, all I succeeded in doing was get the basketball stuck in mid air.  I even tried shooting it down with my assault rifle, but it wasn't going anywhere.\n\nBetween the crash, the glitches, and the bad dialog, you're probably thinking this isn't a very good game, and you'd be right.  The only charm it has is in that B-movie vibe you get from the story, but even then it's pretty cheesy and there are some gaps in logic that make it hard to ignore.\n\nLike Pablo.  Pablo is a character you meet, who is kind of charming with his broken English.  He gets shot during a cutscene and goes on about his shot leg and how he can't go with you.  Then the cut scene ends, and there is Pablo standing up on both legs, watching as I leave.   Meanwhile, 5 feet away is a med station.  I guess the med stations don't work on bulletholes in legs or something.\n\nIt's not so much that I dislike Alpha Prime, but there's really just nothing particularly redeeming about it.  There are simply much better games out there to spend your time on.\n\nOverall Recommendation:  Pass\n\n","June 16, 2015","false","1.0"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","37","47","4","0"

AP was released in 2007 alongside the likes of the first Uncharted, MW4, Crysis, Halo 3 to name just a few. Thats tough company to be a part of and why AP is forgettable.

Voice acting: You'll either like it or you'll hate it because it's pretty bad, but for me it's quite funny so I like it (that Italian dude tho). Played it on hard mode right off the bat but it's cool. Some might say that this is too hard because the enemies' aim is good but it's more realistic that way so that's a plus for me, especially how you can use things to indirectly kill enemies. Graphics are good for its time, nothing to complain about.\n\nBuying it for full price would definitely be a gamble (considering people's tastes these days) but if you can get it for a good discount, then it would be a great buy indeed.\n\nAgain, I'd like to remind you that this is a $5 game released in 2007. Don't expect too much of it so you'll [probably] have as much, more or less, fun with it as I have.

However, I was somewhat surprised. Sure, Alpha Prime is nothing extraordinary, but it's not crap by any means either.\n\nIt's a standard corridor FPS with a story. If you like FPS games, there is nothing to complain about here, aside from perhaps the difficulty being a bit too high. I've played on Easy and even then some sections were unusually hard and caused me to die many times.\n\nThe story isn't bad either. Again, it's nothing groundbreaking, but for an FPS game it's pretty decent. Most FPS games don't make anywhere near the effort in the story department as Alpha Prime does. The cutscenes and the radio dialogue sections between the characters were a nice addition to keep the game interesting. Most characters were developed reasonably well in terms of personality.\n\nThe graphics are very nice. Considering the game came out in 2007, those are pretty decent visuals, even by today's standards. The music is also not bad. There are only about 1 or 2 jarring heavy rock tracks, but the rest of the soundtrack is pretty good and gives a nice epic feel to the battles.\n\nThe enemy variety could've certainly used some work. You spend a good 80% of the game just fighting spec ops, which gets repetitive eventually. There are some other gameplay sections added too, like hacking, and using a loader to move boxes out of the way, which is a nice change of pace, even if some sections were quite annoying. The loader in particular was difficult to control, and having to move a dozen of boxes out of the way just felt like a waste of time.\n\nIn general the game is not as bad as the reviews claim it to be. It's just a standard, above average FPS that will keep you entertained for a few hours. If you are into the genre, give it a try, otherwise pass it up.","February 16","true","5.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

There are a few exceptions; secrets and alternative routes. Good level design helps very much in this regard as each area feels pretty well thought out and assets doesn't feel overly repeated.\n\nI thought level design was pretty good. What messes things up is the scripted stuff. I.E take the wrong route, the jump-scare-enemy bugs out and crashes your game... twice.. or until you enter the room through the expected entrance. If you spot enemies and shoot them from afar, an elevator might not come down because the enemies the were scripted to use it and bring it down, thus, you'll have to reload to an earlier savegame.\nUnfortunately, stuff like this screws the game up badly. Use quick-saves often.\n\nThis game is pretty weak on the story, which is delivered by some of the absolute worst voice actors I've heard. There are no exceptions. In fact, it's so bad it gets good. Ironic as it is, I laughed through the cut-scenes. Not much of it makes sense. Theese things, though unintentionally, serves as a comical break between game-play. It just feels funny.. for some reason. Brilliance in it's own, accidental way.\n\nDifficulty wise, the game is schizophrenic. You'll have a complete breeze throughout the first third of the game. Braindead A.I. This gets compensated as the soldiers appear. It's not easy any more. The difficulty suddenly sky-rockets through the roof. It's braindead A.I but with pinpoint accuracy. Regardless, it's a challenge.\n\nThis game also features a hack system. You can hack surveillance cams, turretguns and locked doors to reach secret areas.\nHacking is really only required once, and that is to open a door. Everything else is solvable without it.\n\nVehicle sections in this game is bad. You'll want to get them over with as soon as possible. Thankfully you won't have to do it much.\n\nAlpha Prime is not a game with a limited two-weapon system, you can actually carry the entire arsenal. However, you are most likely to use the assault rifle.. It's way too overpowered compared to the other weapons.\nYou'll only use the sniper rifle when the distance requires a scope, otherwise the assault rifle is about as accurate, holds more rounds and fires more rapidly.\nIn close quarters, you'd normally favour a shotgun, but a two shot burst with the assault rifle is just as good and ammunition is plentiful.\nThe use of explosives is rarely ever called for, and in those situations, they are so unreliable you might be better off with the assault rifle even in these situations.\nLastly, the embarrassing axe that leaves bullet-hole decals on walls. It fires as fast as you can click your mouse button. It's completely broken. Luckily, you'll never ever find use for it. It's exists just for the sake of it.\n\nIn terms of graphics, this game can't compete with the mainstream contemporaries of it's time (which would be Bioshock or ... Crysis). Rather, this game looks like a bright Doom 3, which means it looked dated even at release. But as this game is old and has a low pricetag, that shouldn't matter now.\n\nSound assets works. Nothing really special to mention here. None of the weapon-sounds makes them feel punchy enough, but the overall ambience is doing it's job rather well.\n\nSo, overall, this game looks and feels like a non-scary Doom 3 mod. It's kind of a B-graded game that certainly has it's problems. But if you are ready to overlook that and just take it for what it is, (a game that's actually cheaper than a subway sandwich) you might have good time with it. I know I had.\nI like it for what it is.\n\nCheers!","November 26, 2013","true","34.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The controls are ok , although you might need to experiment with the mouse sensitivity a bit. The story is nothing you haven't heard or seen before , but it could be worse. The AI is not very intelligent and seems to hit you always , but at least they don't know you're there until you shoot or come closer , so you can sometimes take some of them out with headshots before they shoot back. You can use a bullet time power that you get early in the game to make this a little easier. You'll also get a simple remote hacking device that allows you to hack cameras in the next room or hack gas pipe so they explode and can take out some enemies if they are near the pipe. If you're desperate you could also throw random objects at your enemies :) . SO if you're looking for an interesting and original story this is probably not your game. If your looking for a decent shooter that doesn't cost too much and offers you several hours of fun , then you should definitely try it. There is a demo available by the way so you you can test it without having to pay money. Also don't overcritize the game should you not like it ... it's a low budget game as i said and for that they did a fine job.","May 13","true","10.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadrunner1/recommended/2590/","roadrunner1","Road Runner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadrunner1/","551 products in account","I would call this game decent in almost every aspect. The graphics are not bad for a 2007 release I think. OK, it's not Crysis but that game was way ahead of it's time. Compared to the more typical games from that year, it holds up well. The sound is probably the weakest part of the game. Guns and other sound effects are really not that interesting.\nThere are quite a lot of cutscenes with spoken dialogue in the game. Storyline and voice acting is again, decent. Certainly not the on the level of the more big budget releases but that's ofcourse understandable. I've seen and heard worse. The AI baddies have very limited dialogue. The "Go go go!" and "Quickly fallback!" can get on your nerves quickly, especially when you encounter larger groups. Just kill them... quickly (or fallback :)\nThe game lends some aspects of some well known FPS games, like the resupplying of health from dispensers on the walls, like in Half-Life. (So no health regeneration) The slowmo from F.E.A.R. although it doesn't seem to work that well, like in F.E.A.R. I ended up not using it that much.\nAlong the way you pickup various weapons. Nothing like we've never seen before. There's a melee weapon, pistol, shotty, machine gun, a sniper like weapon, flamethrower and rocket launcher. Oh and of course, your grenades :)\nDon't expect this game to be a walk in the park. It can be really challenging on normal or hard difficulty. The AI is deadly accurate and you take a lot of damage really fast. It can lead to frustration fast if you are not careful enough.  It's not a game were you can storm into every room Rambo style to shoot everything that moves. Luckily you can quicksave the game instead of having a checkpoint system. You can also hack security camera's, often giving you the ability to see what's in another room. There's also the ability to lean, wich works well and is a welcome addition to this type of shooter.\nThe game doesn't do anything new or something that you will remember for years to come. It's more of a short blast. If you are into a more simplistic shooter, with above average difficulty, this is an interesting game to look at. Especially giving the fact that the game barely costs anything.","January 11, 2015","true","7.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It has some atrocious voice acting. This may be a plus for you, and if it is, you're in luck, as it's about the only redeemable part about it. Especially the random Italian dude who goes by the name of Paolo Bellini. He's a boss. And the two drunkards in the beginning of the game too.\n\nEverything else though? Well, let's see here. The gameplay is asinine. You'll have enemies shooting you through walls, shouting the same 3 lines of dialogue over and over again just to occasionally peek out the corner to try and take a shot at you. They're damn accurate but fortunately you have shrooms (hubbardium) that gives you bullet time so I guess that's okay. :|\n\nThere's a plot but it's forgettable since it's been done so many times before. Yet the game thinks otherwise as it loves its cutscenes, sometimes being really long and drawn out. Also I guess there was a twist but you could see it a mile away anyway since there were only like 5 characters. And when the plot tells you one of them isn't what they appear to be, I'm just going to say that it's probably not that hard to find out.\n\nThe dialogue and the voice acting, as mentioned above, are so bad it's good sometimes, especially the main character's attempts at humor. And you get calls, a lot of calls. One of these even got me killed once, as my character sat there listening as the dialogue kept going on while this one soldier kept shooting him until he was dead. And no, I couldn't skip the damn call. Autosaves? What are those? This game doesn't do autosaves until you beat the level you're in, so get used to quicksaving a lot.\n\nAll in all this game is worth it only for the ridiculous dialogue but you can probably find that in YouTube clips.

You shoot enemies, watch a cut scene, shoot some more, interact with something, repeat.A pretty shell for a game that's pretty lacking. Not much fun. Flashy weapon effects partially mask the mediocre gameplay, and to the untrained eye, Alpha Prime could almost pass as "Doom 3".All in all this game is solidly average.

No, probably not.\nThere's simply too many other, better games out there to be had for the same price.\n\nIs this game fun? Sure it has it's moments. At times it feels more like a strategy game than a straightforward shooter.\nAt no time in this game can you do anything even resembling what is shown in the videos above, as far as running around jumping at enemies throwing grenades and shooting rampantly. You will always be low on HP, and low on ammo. The enemies always shoot first and they never but rarely ever miss. Most of them take 8-10 shots to the face to kill, and they come in groups.\n\nThe weapons are frustratingly bad.\nOthers here have mentioned how incredibly terrible the shotgun is, and I agree, for a game anyhow.\nMost FPS players are used to an overpowered unrealistic shotgun. In the MW and COD games you are using a rifled barreled fully choked military grade weapon. In this game, the shotgun is basically a sawed off shotgun from a seedy pawn shop. Surprisingly is shoots very similar to a real sawed off shotgun, but that doesn't mean it should ever have been put into the game this way. You'll need to be no farther than about 15 feet from your target if you hope to even hit it. About 6 feet if you hope to kill anything. It's just frustrating. Especially since the game keeps giving you ammo for the damn thing, over and over and no ammo for the assault rifle, which itself is pretty underpowered.  I found myself going for my pistol, over the shotgun, because the pistol is so overpowered compared even to the AR that it's kind of silly. Too bad you rarely get any ammo for it.\n\nThe best gun in the game by far in my opinion in the sniper rifle. Though throughout the entire game, you'll only get about 40 rounds for the thing, and all but the lowest enemies require 2 or 3 shots to the face to kill with it. Why is it my favorite? I don't know, I guess it's the only one of the weapons that almost felt like it was done right.\n\nThe grenades are a joke. You can toss one 4 feet from a guy, and he won't even go into the damage animation.\nYou literally have to hope the grenade lands at his feet, preferably ON his feet if you want him to die.\n\nI suppose I should mention there is a Flamethrower, a Rocket Launcher, and a Hammer for a melee weapon.\nNo real reason to mention them though.\nOn several occasions I hit an guy in the face with a rocket, and he didn't even care. I'm sure it did some damage, but it's comical to see such a huge explosion, and out of the fire and smoke the guy is still shooting at you.\n\nThe Flamethrower has the range of a hairspray can lit with a lighter. It's sometimes funny to watch the flame thrower enemies shooting flame at you from 8 feet away and you not taking damage. It's not so funny when you're the one using it though. Also it's comically underpowered. A complete botch of a weapon and no surprise, there's plenty of ammo to be found for it. The game also hides the damn things in secret rooms, as if it's some super weapon you'd actually want to use.\n\nThe Hammer is your melee weapon.\nIt's so pathetic that it even exists that it's hard for me to find words as to describe why it's even in the game.\nEnemies shoot you with unmissable headshots from hundreds of yards away, and the game gives you a frigging hammer.\nDo I even need to mention it's uselessly underpowered?\n\nThe levels are passable. They are strictly linear affairs, which isn't uncommon. The amount of unused and useless rooms was probably meant to give the game some feeling of depth, but to me it just felt unfinished.\n\nThe platforming parts of the game are stupid. This game should not have them. The jumping is beyond bad. Your legs are made of glass, because if you fall or jump from more than about 6 feet you will die. I'm no badass weapon weilding space marine like this guy but I've somehow managed to survive jumping off the side of a pickup truck. That would be death for the hero of this game.\n\nThe physics in the game are annoying. Throughout the game, most things you grab will fall through the floor, or go into a frenetic jiggle spazm until it flies across the room, only to then sink into the floor when it comes to a rest.\n\nIt was kind of cool to have to take the lid off of boxes to see what was inside though. Unfortunately of the hundreds of boxes in this game, only about 10 have anything in them. Which lead me to beleive the location for the game is a facility to mine and store Empty Boxes.\n\nThere's an F5 quicksave feature that eventually becomes so necessary that you become glad it doesn't take but a second or two for it to save. I found myself killing one enemy, hitting save, killing another, hitting save, etc.\n\nSo why am I giving this game a thumbs up?\nTruthfully, it's a bad game, but I had fun in spite of myself.\nPlus there's 90% off Steam coupons to be had which means you can experience the pain of this game yourself for only 50 cents. It's hard to pass up anything for that price.\nIf nothing else, you can have the experience of what an FPS game is like when you do nearly everything wrong in making it.","February 1, 2014","true","6.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game isn't at all that bad, but it's few virtues don't suffice to make it recomendable.\n\nBefore you buy this game, try out the Demo - if you like the game, buy it, you probably won't regret it at all. If you are in doubt or even have reservations against this game, don't buy it. It is at time very stereotypical and sadly very shallow. The fights are "sometimes" marvelous, not always though, because sometimes the AI glitches.\n\nOne reviewer noted that you need brains to play the game. I wouldn't say so, the game is at times too easy and sometimes even with all tactical acting so unfair (which might have to do with some of the AI glitches) that younger and more agressive audiences will often ragequit the game. I experienced myself one rather ugly glitch, were an enemy fell off a ledge (the same fall would have killed you instantly by the way) and was unreachable by my own armaments, the foe was unkillable - at the same time he could kill you in his spare time with a rocket launcher. This wasn't the only instance in which the impression came to mind that the game could cheat.\n\nYou have to keep in mind though, that this game was released in 2007, so it's dated and maybe it might have trouble with some GA settings.\n\nOn the other hand this game is solid, not good but neither bad. It's hard to give a recomendation based on just what I experienced in the game. So I create here a conditional recomendation. If you are into FPS with Sci-Fi or Science Horror genre settings you might wish to add this game to your library, but Fans of the "pure" FPS genre beware, this game might take you to places you never wanted to know - maybe ask your friendly collorectal surgeon next door whether he can give you some insights about a place were the sun never shines.\n\nPersonally, I won't recomend the game at all, the story is a bit to worn for me, and there are too much stereotypes and even to much bad placed movie quotes inside...","April 26, 2015","false","14.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Franklin_Pierce/recommended/2590/","Franklin_Pierce","Eggs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Franklin_Pierce/","813 products in account","This is a bad game overall.\n\nI will be comparing this game to Bioshock and Half-Life, the two master pieces this game tries hard to imitate.\n\nIssues I had with the game:\n\nMy biggest gripe is the constant stop and go with game play. What causes the stop and go? The constant com link chats you have with in game characters. Unlike Bioshock where you are allowed to keep walking and keep up the action, when a character decides to chat with you through the radio you are forced to stand still until the conversation is over. This can take 15 seconds or 2 minutes. It really hurts the game play. It might be better if the voice acting for some of the characters wasn't so ♥♥♥♥ poor. (Oh my word that Italian guy is the absolute worst). One momment you're jumping into a large areana killing guys and then heading upstairs only to be stopped half way up to talk about interpersonal relationships with a girl who has you in a cuckhold.. which brings me to my next gripe.\n\nThe story is bad. It does a poor job of trying to explain itself. I felt like it could have been really awesome. In the begining I was actually interested. You first land on the planet and you get a hard Bioshock vibe. These old miners are addicited to this mineral and they fight anyone who comes near. (Sounds like ADAM and Splicers, right?) But the game quickly throws these enemies out and replaces them with the same 4 cookie cutter enemies for the rest of the game.  The relationship between the main protagonist and the girl changes so often, one moment he'd die for her and the next he's complaining about her demanding nature... pick a side fella.\n\nSides, theres another gripe I have with the game. The game gives you 3 characters that are on your "team". The only thing they will ever do in the game is talk to you over the radio. Once you actually meet any of characters they are quickly written off in various ways, never do you actually fight along side a team mate..... but this is probably due to the fact that the games AI is ridiculous.\n\nThe AI can notice you from across the map at points in the game, which completely ruins the level designs because in the levels on which you are fighting on a two floor arena the enemies on floor oposite of you will notice you immediately and engage with you. So instead of having two equal difficulty floors you have one giant arena with enemies coming from all around.\n\nQuick final gripes:\n\n* The script is far to on the nose, reminds me of classic horror films where scientists would make wild very detailed conclusions that would end up being 100% true.\n*  The Flame thrower is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cousin of the weapons family in this game. Burns ammo so quickly, reload takes forever, range is garbage, damage is practically 0.\n* Some elevators wait for input, some decide to leave when they feel like it.\n* Bad Lighting, some white characters look black at points in the game.\n* If you stand still on the stairs you will slide down making some combat points in the game really hard.\n* The main antagonist sounds like a college aged math student. Nothing against college aged math students, only they don't really sound like the threating type.\n* The final boss is soooooooo easy, it took me one try and less than a minute thirty to kill him.\n* After walking into some doors, ones that load up the next level, you will pop up into a location in location that makes you feel like you teleported half an hour  further into the game.\n\nTL:DR\nPoor mans copy of Bioshock/HalfLife isn't worth your time or money, at any price.","December 25, 2015","false","10.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gaydar/recommended/2590/","Gaydar","Gray","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gaydar/","457 products in account","Alpha Prime is a Sci-Fi FPS based on a space station (a mine for a rare, new mineral called habardium.. or something) which has suffered an accident and on which there are only a handful of survivors. You have been sent in at the behest of your ex in order to save their current husband to be from the station.\n\nThe game plays somewhat like an inferior Fear, having sci-fi weaponry and the ability to slow down time for a short while, but the guns in the game feel very underpowered. The assault rifle is the only weapon that is of any worth - the sniper rifle, shotgun and pistol doing practically no damage and being inferior in every situation to just tap shooting from the assault rifle. For 10 rounds you can kill an enemy which may take a second or two, but two shotgun blasts will take perhaps double that - and the shotgun is only able to be used at close range, where your health will vanish pretty quickly.\n\nThe game is pretty unforgiving in some places with the combat. Your slow motion doesn't recharge on it's own and requires the mineral harbidudmidmm (you know, the mineral that's being mined on the station that you're turning into your own battlezone) and a single enemy, unchecked, can easily kill you. Additionally, ammunition for the assault rifle is pretty hard to find, even though it drops off of the enemies that you kill, meaning that a tight spot might grow tighter.\n\nThe game has aged to a far greater degree than Fear, whilst the Unreal 2 engine's physics and lighting standards are still adequete enough, the physics in this game leave much to be desired. Ragdolls seem to go through objects sometimes and get stuck in them, the ground is often littered with random objects which you can easily get snagged on and the lighting seems hardly like a step up on DOOM.\n\nTL;DR it sucks","June 12, 2014","false","0.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Decent graphics, very low price, runs like a scalded hound on even my old core 2 duo.  No crashes or weirdness, cutscenes are amusing and do advance the story somewhat.  Reminds me a bit of Sin-Episodes, only I like this better.  I tried enabling PhysX, didn't like the look of the game as well with it, and made it crashy and messed up my save, only time I had a technical problem.  If you try to run and gun in this, you will be very dead, use cover and pick your shots.  Also, no regenerating health, which is a plus for me.\nPeople make a big deal about a bug where you can kill your character with a rebounding basketball, I found that hilarious.  It is bizarre, but I haven't seen many (any?) games without some strange effect in one place or another.  I've been stuck behind a box in Quake 2, stuck to the surface of a lift in Half Life, and been killed in Halflife 2 by walking next to a stationary train, just to name a few.

But with so much potential for something cool and possibly refreshing at best, the most infuriating thing about Alpha Prime is that it never gets anywhere near you think it should. If you're starving for a bit of Sci-Fi action and find it cheap, go ahead if you're willing to risk it.

You are John Prime (or whatever his name is) who is lured by his ex to save her current boyfriend from what can only be described as the biggest cluster♥♥♥♥ of trouble ever. Yep , stuck on a mining planet with a bunch of crazed miners and hostile robots. And then the corporation owning the mine sends swat teams to clean up the mess (you included).\n\nGameplay is pretty standard- you've got your shotgun , machinegun , sniper and stuff. Oh , and bullet time. Bullet time is pretty much useless , cause unlike other games that use a slowing time mechanic , here your bullets and you get slowed down the same amount as the enemies. You know how in Max Payne you trigger bullet time while falling so you gently soar like an oak leaf in October , but you still can aim with almost the same speed as outside bullet time , and your bullets travel a little bit faster than the enemy's. Well you wont see that in Alpha prime. In bullet time you move and shoot just as slow as your enemies , you still aim at normal speed , but it seems the AI does too. What you can , and should use are the lean buttons. Yep , [Q] and [E] are going to be your best buds again after all these years (ok you might have used E for Use , its bound to F now). I have found that you take 5-10 times less damage if leaning compared to popping out using A/D. Your health does not regenerate , but there are med kits and med stations (a-la Half Life/Jedi Knight) scattered around.\n\nOh , also , dont let the screenshots fool you - the game has 1080p\n\nIn conclusion: OK game if you like generic FPS , can be a little unforgiving at times , but the first few levels have more than enough med kits.\n\nAlso , I read someones review , that said objectives pop up for a few seconds and then you cant check them afterwards.

Solid shooter that clearly takes its influence from the Half-life 2 style era while looking like a prettier and more optimistic Doom 3. However it honestly has better gunplay than both. ADS, peeking, solid hit detection, good feeling to the guns, and challenging shoot outs with an optional bullet time element and some occasional triggerable eviromental bits through the game's "hacking" feature. The game is also a lot of fun with how it lets you toy with the world around you with some gimmicky but fun physics that range from lifting lids off of crates for ammo to simply playing basketball in a gym room. Oh and no regenerating health, you find your supplies across dispencers and pick-ups like it should be done giving the game more depth and challenge. Its mostly raw solid gunplay and shooter action following familiar mechanics that works out pretty well. The game also has some of the best music I've probably heard in a long time from an FPS game, and the best part is it's free on their website.\n\nThe game attempts a story, but the less said about it might be for the best as it really isn't that great and far from the highlight of the game. By the end the plot seems a bit confused of itself and ends on a note that will likely just leave you scratching your head. Meanwhile another thing worth noting on the downside is that several of the game's special mechanics get a little underplayed on the last two levels with the bullet time recourse running low, and hackable objects basically removed from battles. The game is also critcized for near perfect AI aim, which is true but honestly I think it actually added to the fun. Peaking around corners and trying to hit headshots before they shot back at me was just a part of adapting to the gunplay and felt natural. The AI also moves around, doges, calls out orders, and fliches to damage also giving them more life and opening them up to weak points making their aimbot skills more tolerable.\n\nAt the end of the day I really enjoyed this game and it kind of made me sad we don't get games like this anymore. It had a weird plastic sci-fi feeling with amazing industrial techno rock music that felt right and sort of felt nostalgic of the 90's/early 2000's while giving me gameplay from a better era of corridor shooters. I'd recomend this game to people who grew up around an earlier era of FPS, or just want a bit of an escape from the current market for a good cheap action packed FPS. I suppose you could look at it as a cheesy fun comfort game in that regard. Oh and again, its cheap... $5.... considering people are buying retro 2D torture platformers for double or more, I'd say this is a steal of a deal by comparison.","February 8, 2014","true","9.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The movement is fluid if nothing else but that is where the enjoyment ends....\nI spent a good amount of time laughing at the horribly animated cinematics and how the voice actors sounded worse than my mothers soap operas. Everything sounded so out of place. Not to mention that the story has plenty of holes, as it appears you are the ONLY PERSON who can possibly save 1 person on a planet full of crazed maniacs...\nOh yea, and the back story, non-existant; all you know is that your character looks like Bill Muray and that he has some history with a chick, and he likes to have long...dramatic... monolauges.\nLet me just bring into perspective how laughable this is, the game give you the cheesiest looking hammer in the world to begin with, as a weapon... in a planet you know you will need to defend yourself on... I spent about half an hour walking around yelling "FIX IT FELIX" and then replying to myself saying "THIS GAME CANNOT BE FIXED".\nEnemies only have the edge as their 6th sense allows them to turn on a dime the second you enter a room, they are creepy sounding and clunky, which makes them terrifying in ways the game didn't even intend. Other than that they are laughable, and take a few hammer swings to cough up what ever gun they are carrying. So what do enemies in this game look like? Anyone who's alive. I ran into one friendly and quickly lost him, + robots, can't live without the robots.\nWeapons are unimmaginative, you have a pistol, a shotgun, a rifle and some grenades and then probably some more weapons I failed to care about retrieving. The weapons are slow, sluggish and don't give you the feel of power a gun should.\nOver all this game is a waste of money, I couldn't even beat it as a joke.

Guess I'm just a sucker and I feel like I have to finish what I start\nDoes it have any redeeming features then?\n-None whatsoever, the gameplay is poorly balanced, some of the difficulty spikes are frustrating, additional elements like the buggy or the trams are tedious to control and you'll wish they weren't in the game. The voice acting is so bad that it's funny and the sound montage is so amateur it's hilarious. Furthermore the game is full of bugs of every possible nature, flickery textures and floating objects everywhere, things falling through the map or blocking your path, but most of all the game crashes, all the time. I've not managed to play it for more than 30-45mns without experiencing at least one crash.\nWow that sounds pretty bad.\n-Yeah but it gets better, the game actually stopped working for about a week, it just wouldn't launch. I contact Meridian 4 customer support but did not get a reply.

It's bad... really, really, bad.\n\nWhile you're slogging through the 3 hour long campaign, you'll begin to question your sanity of why you're still playing this game. It gave me high hopes when I received a hammer as my first weapon. Who doesn't like bopping people in the head with such hardware?

This really let's the game's physics engine shine. You will NEVER get the basketball in the hoop. In fact, you can actually be murdered by the basketball. There's a point in the game where you get to drive around in a buggy. It's another terrible experience.\n\nEvery time an enemy fires their gun... you get hit. They're expert marksmen. This game doesn't feature regenerating health, instead you get medkits & medical apparatuses on walls. You can't take much damage on any difficulty. It's frustratingly bad, the gunplay is bad, you don't feel like you can win any firefight triumphantly. You WILL be hit for big chunks of damage no matter what. Alpha Prime does try to execute a really poor slowdown effect that leaves you unsatisfied.

If you have this game or have access to it for free, I would say go for it, but don't pay money for this, your time will be better spent on another FPS... or you know... in the real world.\n\nThe storyline is sort of bland: Arnold, your silver fox, body builder, genius badass is mining a mysterious radioactive ore on some planet in some fictional universe with humans. He is the only one not being driven mad and so you have to shoot your way out of the space ship and blah blah standard Sci-Fi FPS.\n\nSpoilers ahead???\nThe differences: Oxygen depletion happens when you're not in a sealed structure or breathing directly through an oxygen mask on a wall. When outside, you have to move quickly and get to the next oxygen mask to strategically plan your next move. You can also save at any time and will probably need to do that a lot because of how often you die. There are a standard set of guns, although the flamethrower is sort of sadly useless... There are some cool tech gadgets, where you can hack cameras and mines through the walls before entering a room. Some missions require you to carry [giant] batteries with you to restore power to doors and such. So overall although they did mix it up and add some spice to the gameplay, its still primarily an (almost) outdated FPS.\n\nThe storyline is lacking, but certainly has some [randomly] brash lines, and decent voice acting. The protagonist has solid voice acting actually, in fact, one of the better voices I've heard considering the lines he was reading were complete ♥♥♥♥ half of the time. Some of the other characters sound like they read one line per day with the same inflection and different words, particularly the foreign guy without much experience in English.\n\nThe most memorable and worthy lines of the game, that convinced me to keep playing during a hard and honestly boring part:\n\n\n"Arnold, you'll have to hold them off just a little bit longer!!!", says the other character while he was hacking a computer-motherboard-mainframe-core-system to save both of their lives.\n\n"Why? So you can finish surfing porn?" Arnold is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and a badass even when a tech guru is saving his life and he is shotgunning 20 dudes at once.\n\nThe game is hard, like 2007 hard. I'm saying like you can't just play this game through casually on normal difficulty because people will actually hit you with most of their bullets and rockets (Although, even in the hands of the villain, the flamethrower sucks ♥♥♥ unless you're stuck in an elevator with them).\n\n\nTL;DR:\nI know I've just expressed a lot of conflicting like and dislike for this game, but that's how it feels to play it overall, you like it, and then you kind of wish you didn't spend an hour playing it, especially when you forget to save for a half hour and then get smoked by a big fat robot rocket.\n\nSlow, tactful, diverse.\nEnjoy.","May 15, 2014","true","9.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's also absurdly difficult. On normal you start with 20% health and every enemy is able to nearly OHK you with a pistol as soon as you peek a corner. The mechanics are bad, things as simple as pressing a door button becomes infuriating after twenty seconds of playing, since pressing door buttons is about 40% of the game's content.\n\nI highly recommend this game.

The Dialog parts are annoying and really for me did not add to much to the game, and some of them take place while your underfire meaning you have to escape the talking part and loose the story in order to survive.

Throwing large heavy box at enemy causes no reaction.\nBenellini > Tortellini. Also every character knows how to hack things.11/10\n\nBut in all seriousness, this game probably won't be eating up too much more of my time. Its just kinda  uninteresting, and requires too much trial and effort on my part that I don't feel like donating. Not to mention that in 2 hours I encountered about 5 or so different bugs. I'll admit though, running through locked doors at the one point did kind of give me an advantage, and saved me about 15 mins worth of redos.\n\nOverall this game is just coated in B-movie cheese. Sure the effects are great and theres a number of passable one-liners, but it lacks the kind of depth a bigger budget or some more effort could have provided. The plot is forgettable and a little confusing (What was Benelli trying to do with the hubbardium? Drive himself even more insane? Why am I immune to the crazy ♥♥♥♥, and also getting drunk? Where did that black guy come from, and why does he care what's going on?Why do I give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about those questions at all?) the action is explosive but repetitive, the visuals are pretty but slightly generic, and my character talks like a typical movie badass.\n\nThe features of this game that give it some merit are as follows: one-liners, lean keys, a neat hacking tool, basketball, occasionally some pumping music (otherwise silence...such harsh, harsh, silence), and weapons that pack a punch (why does everyone claim they're weak? I found them to be effective enough besides the flamethrower and grenades). That's about all i got.

Going into the game my expectations were not very high, after reading some of the other reviews. However, I was pleasantly suprised by this game, it was a lot of fun. The story in Alpha Prime, in my opinion, was pretty original, and it keeps you guessing all throught the game. As far as gameplay, it functions as a pretty standard FPS, but has the best, and easiest to use, hacking system I have seen implemented in a game. You don't get the opportunity to hack very often, but when you do, it really helps even the playing field. Overall I highly recommend this game, it has its flaws, but what game doesn't. Plus you get your money's worth, since you only have to pay $4.99.","March 8, 2014","true","5.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game itself would not be bad at all, blunt story, nice graphics (Doom3 in color :D) but it fails gameplay-wise. Jumping is like on the Moon, even when indoors where gravity should be Earth-like. Enemies are dumb as hell, if you restart a scene, most of them will wander to the same spots... Biggest issue is though you do not feel when you are shot. There is indication on screen edges still you do not recognize when you are shot. Therefore you notice enemies too late and they are unforgiving.","January 4, 2015","false","2.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you like the sci-fi shooters such as Red Faction, Mass Effect, Dead Space, Lost Planet,... then you will enjoy this game! And the graphics are very good in 1080p and all settings maxed out. No need for anti aliasing, save a few watts and leave it disabled. Looks great and runs stable.\n\nThe only thing you should do is edit the settings config file to manually Enable V Sync. Because in-game options do not have v sync setting. Go to your install folder and edit settings.cfg. Find "vsync 0" and change it to "vsync 1". More info and original post by slimak: http://steamcommunity.com/app/2590/discussions/0/648817377636759394/?insideModal=1\n\nThe reason you should enable vsync is the exact same reason you should ALWAYS enable it in every game. Because you don't need your game to run at 5000fps, to run hot and use extreme amounts of electricity whilst generating large amounts of heat and GPU load. That's why you lock it down to 60 / 75fps or whatever your display's screen refresh is. Alpha Prime uses about 230 Watts to run on a high end gaming computer. The same game runs at only 160 Watts with exact same settings, graphics card fan is quiet and low heat after enabling vsync. Wattages meassured computer's power consumption at the wall socket during play. Enable vsync and enjoy this fantastic game.","August 31, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","12"

It featured a pretty basic plot: Alpha Prime, a mining asteroid, is rich in Hubbardium, and the miners who touch hubbardium eventually go mad. The protagonist, Arnold Weiss, was recruited by LIvia, old friend, to rescue a mutual friend, Warren Reynolds, stranded on Alpha Prime when it was sealed off. Upon getting there, Weiss made it down to the surface, dealt with various obstacles in his way, including mad miners, defense robots, environmental puzzles, then corporate enforcers arrived to "clean up" the situation (kill any survivors). There's apparently a spy left on Alpha Prime... Who was it? Who is helping Weiss? What is Glomar? As Weiss shoot his way through the asteroid, even enjoy a bit of walk on the surface, and drive a buggy... but who can you trust?\n\nAlpha Prime is a pretty normal first-person shooter with a bit of environmental puzzle, and some alternate approaches. Soon after the first level you're given a hack device that can access all sorts of electroics, and in some rooms, you can remote access the camera (through the wall) and figure out what's on the other side, and sometimes, access control valves to release some flames to cook the defenders before you enter. There are some areas that requries you to periodically access oxygen stations, which can be... VERY annoying. Different weapons are different, but not overly so, as they still fall into the archetypes: pistol, assault rifle, SMG, shotgun, rocket, etc. There are locations where you need to remote control switches, robots, and so on.\n\nGiven how old this game is, it's not surprising that the game looks well outdated but actually quite tolerable on modern hardware, even though the models have fairly low poly count. The alternate methods to achieve the same object is also rather refeshing, compared to modern games where fixed and scripted objectives. The graphics are quite decent while the sound is a bit too, and the voice acting is too cliche.\n\nYou can find better FPS than this... If this is less then $5, give it a try.

Would you like to be some guy that looks like Bill Murray in a Dead Space scenario type? Do you like to break controls because of lots of glitches, sometimes bad level design, and enemies with pixel-perfect accuracy?\n\nTo be honest, I didnt expect much from this game but, aside from the terrible glitches I experienced, it's a decent ride. The story is something that feels like good fan-fiction at first but by the time you get through the first half of the game, you realize that not much is really going on, characters feel flat and their motivations are just...well, I think that Commando with Schwaznegger fleshed out a much deeper story.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it mixes the slo-mo mechanics from F.E.A.R. games with hacking. A pretty interesting idea that I believe was intended to make your combat experience more diverse. Unfortunately, it falls flat, seriously, the slo-mo mecanic doesnt work to your advantage and the hacking system seems to be completely forgotten by level designers towards the final levels of the game.\n\nAs for design, acting, sound and stuff, its good, didnt have any framedrops or audio problems. My only "problems" and I cant say that I disliked them because they're hilarious are: one voice actor who needs to be fired, because he's reading the freaking script! And that your character looks like Bill Murray, seriously, I thought I was Murray in a commander Shepard suit.\n\nOverall, I'd give it 6/10. I would suggest it if: you find it cheap, you like movies like sharknado, you dont mind some frustrating combat.","June 19, 2015","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkstarangelo/recommended/2590/","darkstarangelo","DarkStarAngelo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkstarangelo/","764 products in account","Alpha Prime is a fairly interesting game, it's a sci-fi FPS that takes elements from games such as Doom 3 and Quake 4 (Even the aesthetic of the game will remind you of them) and implements some of its own little things here and there. At first it does seem cliche and it kind of is but players will soon find that there is a very slight supernatural element to the game that affects the psyche of all the people surrounding Alpha Prime, turning them into deranged madmen and making the base's AI go nuts and the Corporation is on clean up duty. Your job is to save your friend who's stranded on Alpha Prime.\n\nUnlike most shooters that take a more old school approach (health packs, hip fire, carrying a full arsenal, etc), on normal difficulty the enemies hit very hard which will require you to take a more tactical approach to combat situations which will encourage you to use the lean function as well as the remote control mechanic, allowing you to hack into devices such as cameras, gun turrets, doors and other electronic devices. So since that little introduction is out of the way, now I'll start the review and first I'll break it down into lists of pros and cons to make this review a lot more straight forward:\n\nPros:\n- Fun and solid gunplay\n- Nice visual effects\n- Cool art style\n- Graphics still look good even today\n- No regenerating health, all done with medkits and health stations\n- You can fire from the hip (Always good to have)\n- Characters have a bit of personality to them\n- Level design is pretty good\n- The soundtrack is just awesome\n- Enemy AI are quite intelligent, always seeking cover, trying to outsmart and outgun you whenever possible and will rush you when they have the chance\n- A nice array of weapons to use (A gatling-based assault rifle is pretty awesome)\n- The remote control is cool and fun to use, turning gun turrets against your foes is always fun\n- Very challenging, will crush gamers who are used to modern FPS and regenerating health\n\nCons:\n- The story could have been really cool but it was fairly bland and the cliffhanger didn't help either\n- Bullet time and flamethrower are near enough useless except for the last boss\n- Enemy placement can be very cheap at times making the difficulty feel very artificial\n- Enemy variety is near enough non-existant, just different guys with different guns and some robots\n- Weapons given to the player have pretty poor pacing, it gives you every gun near enough from the get go\n- The remote control mechanic is too underutilized, you'll often forget you have it later in the game\n- Voice acting can be pretty atrocious sometimes\n- The one vehicle segment is just awful, it controls like crap and you can't even run enemies over with it\n- Enemies have pinpoint accuracy to the point where it's unfair at times (And you can't even dodge their shots in bullet time, yes it's that useless)\n- Some character models look creepy, making the main character look like a plastic action figure\n- Cutscenes and dialogue segments go on for WAY too long and when you need to do something, you can't pause them but thankfully they can be skipped\n- The game only runs for the best part of 4 hours, for a single player only game that will be far too short for most\n\nThe game has a lot of flaws, but it's nowhere near as incompetent like games such as The Stalin Subway and Dusk 12 (Which I did enjoy somewhat). It's not awful by any stretch, some people will love what Black Element did with the game, others may not. It really comes down to a matter of opinion and my opinion is that I really enjoyed it, as short as it was, it was a fun little sci-fi romp with lots of action, somewhat interesting characters and cool aesthetic. It's a shame the remote control was barely ever used and the game was very unbalanced at times but it was a fun game to play as the afternoon or evening just wizzes by.\n\nI do recommend this game to those who enjoyed old school shooters or for those who will enjoy something that makes players take a more tactical approach to their combat strategy, for me the positives outweigh the negatives and since I'm a sap for obscure FPS games, there is a chance I will like it for it's quirk. For those who prefer modern FPS with highly linear levels and the overuse of iron sights and regenerating health then this really isn't for you. But if you like kickass FPS soundtracks then this game is great to have, it has some truly fantastic music in there that just gets you really pumped for the action, big kudos to the composer! I'll wrap this up now though, it's on sale now for £0.59 or your regional equivalent and that will give 4 hours of great sci-fi action. I'd say it's worth picking up.","December 22, 2014","true","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game has decent graphics for a 2007 game, it plays very smoothly, but it has a ton of flaws in my opinion.\nFirst, options are lacking, especially sound options. I wanted to try and get the game music down but NPC chatter and cutscene sound higher than that, like I usually do, and there's no separation for that, but maybe they just cut corners on that end.\nThe other thing that really eludes me is what am I doing in the game. I assume there's a storyline and that there are explanations and reasons for what I'm doing, but I don't know them, and I have no idea when are they planning on telling me more than the fact that my name is Arnold.\nThird, I played the game for 20 minutes, and I already got 4 out of 8 weapons in the game. Why are you making it that easy on me? It's like this is going to be a hour and a half completion time for this game.\nNevertheless I didn't really enjoy the game and I call it quits on this one. Some old games are fun to play, like Fable TLC and Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project for me, but this one isn't one of them, sadly.\nIf you got the game whenever and however, I wouldn't recommend playing it, it feels insanely weird in my honest opinion, and the fact I have no idea what am I doing is driving me crazy.","October 16, 2014","false","0.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

After booting it up the game looked old and bad, from the menu the text looks like it was the same text they coded to boot the game and they never bothered changing it, just kept it the same cuz someone thought it looked cool. Afte launching it the characters looked really bad and their models were horrible. Livia has a nice ♥♥♥ but a butterface, they could have at least added more details to the main characters,  i would not have cared as much if the enemies were ugly, but the main characters are no excuse. The AI is also horrible, since basically every shot the AI shoots hits you 95% of the time, no matter what distance, even if its shotgun it basically hits from 30 feet away. but the environment was beautiful and had alot of color and detail to it. The background fighting scene music was terrible and it just ruined the scary tone the game tried to go for.  After the tutorial and going through the cutscenes, you are put against drugged enemies and robots?, I don't know why robots. I finally got into a part where I picked up hubbardium, and it looked strangely familiar in the syringe I thought it was health and when I used it, it slowed down time, and the deja vu kicked in. fighting drugged enemies that are longer human, in slow motion in a game where its basically cut scene then shooting scene, WHERE HAVE I PLAYED THIS BEFORE, ohhh wait. this game is generic copy of FEAR, everything about this game screams fear, from how the weapons look, to the enemies, to the slow motion, and the scary eniovronment they went for but was laughable when you saw the enemies. I really tried to like this game I really did, I gave it a chance even though it was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clone but I just could not, When I got to a part where I met an italian stereotyped character, it just became a joke, the voice acting was so horrible that i just could not play any longer.

The random talk of the enemies is bad and often nonsensical, though.\n\nAll in all, I paid 50 cents for it and I don't regret that purchase.

It takes enemies maybe 3-5 seconds to kill you, and I had it on normal difficulty. So if you encounter more than one enemy you're screwed unless you're good at taking cover, and quickly. The controls feel clunky so I changed them around to feel more comfortable. Having your weapon slots on 1-8 is just annoying, especially in a tense situation you're trying to take out a different weapon so you need to a press number that could be on the other side of  the keyboard. For example, you're shooting your rifle and you decide to take out a grenade. The default for grenade is 8 and for the rifle it's 4. So you need to stop moving completely press 8, throw it, then press 4. Meanwhile you better hope no enemies come around a corner or you're dead. Did I mention the AI doesn't miss? Because it doesn't.\n\nThe script is cringey. The cutscenes bored me to tears so I skipped all of them, especially the stupidly long opening cut scene.

The setting is very much a case of been there, done that a hundred times. The enemies fall under this too. The graphics are workable enough and give off occasional pretty light shows but otherwise just are quite standard with little popping out.\n\nThe storyline too is very cliched, some poor and forgettable voice acting, a selection of guns which run the usual gamut of a melee type, a pistol type, a machine gun type and shotgun type and so on. Theres just nothing very intresting here. Okay, its not an awful game by any means but thats because it never even tries to rise and never once gives any reason to push onwards towards the rather underwhelming ending.\n\nAnd, while its gone down in price heavily, its just still not worth using time up over playing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/recommended/2590/","futome","Claire✿","http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/","322 products in account","This game is quite terrible.\n\n\nI got this game at first because it seemed like it'd be a decent mediocre shooter. But then I realized it was a bad game, not necessarily a huge issue for me because I can enjoy bad games. This game however, is just plain not fun. I gave it two hours to enjoy it. Just, no. It's not.\n\n\nThe story? I dunno! It seems really badly written in the first 2 hours I played, it really just seems to awkwardly play off the protagonists love-triangle thing for some woman he divorced but still loves or something. It's extremely uncomfortable.\nNot to mention the terrible dialouge and some of it almost offensive (paolo) and the scripting and character personalities is utter garbage.\n\n\nThe gameplay is, honestly not what I expected. I expected a game that I could just do really stupid stuff with. That's not this game. It takes itself very seriously. What I mean by that is taking bullet damage feels like taking bullet damage. You lose health reeeaaalllll quick in this game. It honestly expects you to make full use of the arsenal of guns it gives you, bullet time (whhhhyyyy is bullet time in this gameeeeeeeee) and leaning. I'd just like to point out that in less than 20 minutes of this game I had:\nA hammer\nA pistol\nA shotgun\nA gatling gun\nA sniper rifle\nAnd some grenades\n\nWhy I got these things so ridiculously early in the game is beyond me. I'm thinking it's because this game is trying to be like duke nukem or something in terms of difficulty and how to play the game. But seriously, sometimes I just think "did they actually PLAY the game they created?" Because who in their right mind would play though this thing? It feels uncomfortable and with tight rooms and small corridors or open places without much cover. It makes this become serious sam in tight corridors. Which is terrible. If I remember correctly, some of the worst gameplay moments for me in Serious Sam 3 BFE was in corridors and small spaces. Well that's what this game does and there's nothing but those kinds of fights. WHICH DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE. Why would you have a system that almost suggests you play it like it's Max Payne and you should avoid taking bullets at all costs. But yet it's like, serious sam mode where cover is for pansies and you're a man apparently so you need to stand out in the open and eat as many bullets as possible.\n\nYou know a game has poor design when less than 30 minutes into the game you encounter a scenario where the only way you can get past it is "to get lucky"\n\nI had to enter a small corridor with a pair of stairs and since like, the enemies in this game channel the force apparently. These two just dump their gatling guns on you and it's a TIGHT corridor mind you and taking high damage at point blank by guns that have 22 bullets in them before reload? I died there so many times before I got lucky and killed the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nUgh. The art style is generic, the graphics are passable, the guns are kind of fun to use. I liked the shotgun. That was it. The bullet time sucks and it's obviously a gimmick. The sounds are kind of basic but they're good enough and the music is somewhat out of place in a sense it's unncessarily intense for a small skimrish scenario.\n\nAnyway, all of that aside, I suggest you do not purchase this product. It's not good, it's not fun. I couldn't bear more than 2 hours of this game. Stay away and do not play this product.\n\n\nThank you for reading my review, I hope you found it helpful in your decision of whether you'd want to purchase this product or not.

One shotgun pellet deals upwards of 35 damage, and the aforementioned perfect aim makes death in one or two hits inevitable.\n\nThe enemy humans do not need oxygen, so you can't wait them out and pick off the ones running for the oxygen pumps on the wall. (In one section, you're in a semi-protected tram car with an oxygen pump nearby.)\n\nYour eye level is not the height at which you can be shot, unlike most first-person shooters. Chest-high walls DO NOT protect against headshots while crouched.\n\nThe grenades do less splash damage than bunny farts, and the fiddly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s don't follow the same physics rules your body or other thrown objects do.\n\nI'd type more but Steam won't let me.

Overall nothing in this game feels like a finished feature. 3 months more polishing and the game would feel a lot better.\n\nAs it is, the game is definitely not worth much. Although being an FPS game I do not think the combat has anything to offer really, so if you buy this game dirt cheap and want to play it through you should just drop the difficulty level to easy and run it through. Yes, you can play the game with higher settings but it does not make the game any more interesting as the combat is what it is.\n\nI'd say the price cap for this game is around 2€.","January 6, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It turned me off within twenty minutes, and I usually have a really decent tolerance for games that others dislike. In all honesty, I'll put down a list of Pros and Cons to help you understand why.\nPros:\n1.$ 0.49 Cents. (This is only a pro because it was on sale and I didn't waste too much money.)\n2. Uninstall button\nCons:\n1. Horrible intro.  It was too long, offered me very little back story, I couldn't skip it, and the dialogue was either Cliche, or just\nbad writing in general.\n2. Controls are whack, disorientating, hard to work around. You end up doing awkward things, but you could get used to it I suppose.\n3. Voice acting is terrible, and on many an occasion (And this particularly bugged me) during cut scenes, the clips of speech for one moment sound like they're right next to your ear (When they're five feet away) and if you shift away slightly, not even a foot further, suddenly they sound like they're ten to twelve feet away. It bugged me, and instantly turned me away.\n4. Gun controls are slightly off, and make battle generally difficult. Your best bet through most battles is to simply crouch and aim. Running and gunning or even simple ducking for cover are difficult.\n5. On another addition to issue #3 Lipsync also annoyed me. Pretty much the whole intro was bad.\n\nI sincerely hope this is not the end product, or even close. The idea sounds somewhat neat, but there are a lot of things needed to be done before i ever consider this again; Until then, I want my forty nine cents back.\n\n[Edit] Still awful.\n\n16/10 would uninstall again","March 11, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You must understand while the game itself is meh to ok, you're really coming to laugh at the story and dialogue.\n\nYou know those films where the dialog and acting are so bad, it becomes entertaining in a funny way? This is the video game version of that.\n\nSumming up the game play:\n-The levels are designed well enough and varied, but VERY linear and there's a very noticeable lack of detail at times.\n-Enemies aren't varied at all. It's all enemy soldiers and three versions of robots.\n-Standard weapons: Pistol, Shotgun, Sniper Rifle, Machine gun, Rocket Launcher, grenades, etc.\n-The enemy AI goes from being completely unaware that you're standing in front of them to being able to see your movement through walls and rock.\n-Don't waste health because the enemy doesn't miss. Ever. Ok, the guys with the rocket launchers will miss, and the shotgun weilding baddies lack range, but the guys firing pistols and machine guns will always hit you.\n-A Max Payne bullet time like system that felt like it wasn't fleshed out. It can help even out the bigger fights agains the enemies who don't miss.\n-A driving section that comes out of nowhere with poor driving physics.\n-A hacking skill that seems like an after thought, and could have been used more effectively.\n\nThe game itself would be kind of bland without the amazingly bad dialogue and voice acting. Don't worry, you'll get the jist of the story. It's just that you're playing a Sci-Fi game with dialogue that's like it's from a bad 1930s crime novel. On top of that, it's read by people who got bad scripts or don't understand punctuation. I'll grant you something might have been lost in translation, but those English voice actors should have known better.\n\nAgain, if those three stipulations are things you can deal with, pick it up. If not, you should skip this game.","July 18, 2014","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is not particularly interesting but the game doesn't really bore you with details of it to warrant a criticism in this regard. The graphics, although dated, haven't aged particularly badly and the game has enough visual settings to crank up to the max and any mid-range modern graphics card won't even break a sweat to give you more than enough fps with it.\n\nCutscenes are a blast, but I'm sure it's not for the intended reasons, gives the otherwise bland and non crucial story line a dose of warmth. Gameplay is somewhat repetitive and it might tend to get boring if you're having to play a level from the start again, because you died and forgot to save your progress along the way. Overall, if you have some time to kill waiting for the next big AAA title and you don't want to spend much money, get this game (preferably on sale) and have some fun blasting aimlessly at the enemies. There is not much replay value for the game and the graphics engine is outdated, meaning there won't be no wow factor, so take that into consideration before purchasing this game.","May 8, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yet I had fun with it thanks to the good weapon handling [even though hammer and flamethrower were utterly useless, and shotgun and grenades had limited usabilty], hits on target were clearly visible, and the damage- while a bit low, seemed to heave enough force. Some of the better mechanics were definitely this funny "hack vision" and bullet time. The first allowed for some alternative ways to dispose of enemies [shame that level designers completely ignored the potentials it granted, and stopped including it halfway through the game] and gain some view on enemies through cameras; bullet time was used as a rather scarce resource that could grant you a bit more of an upper hand at some of the more dangerous situations, like hard shots or full rooms, so it felt like a fun trump card instead of a core mechanic.\n\nWhile I found it fun, I can't disagree that it would have benefitted from different design decisions, for example: fov slider, smarter level design [this hack thing could have provided some neat secret stashes around the levels if they weren't so straight forward], more and better balanced weapons, more frequent checkpoints, so you don't save all the time, or "use" function on stray medikits, since you could've picked up a huge health boost for little damage by accident. The last boss is also ridiculously bad, it's just: activate 3 terminals, laugh at the "grand challenge"'s poor aim with rocket launcher [enemies are terrible with it as it's not a hitscan weapon they're so used to], while spamming rockets at his face, taking no damage even though the room is cramped, and finally flip the final switch when he wants to cool down for a bit.\n\nSo it's poorly designed, buggy and wonky, the story is dumb, it's short and the music is boring. Yet it's a fun to play single player FPS, that I can recommend for a low price.","July 18, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And even though this game really suffers from an inherent lack of polish, I found myself really wanting to like this game. It bring some solid concepts forward to the table as a shooter, such as the hacking interface. It's sort of like Watchdogs as an FPS with this; scan security cameras to check enemy locations and numbers, set up environmental hazards up for remote detonated traps, and even use some of the machinery for surprise attacks. It has good ideas... BUT...\n\nThere's a lot wrong with this game. On a presentation scale, it's easily the worst part about the game. For a game released in '07, it looks like it comes from '02, and really doesn't have a lot of the aged visuals that can still look good in the modern day with games like, for instance, Unreal Tournament '99. The voice acting is atrociously bad, though it sounds more like bad localization and English dubs, and a lot of the sound quality is atrocious.\n\nGunplay is enjoyable, and some of the weapon designs like the gatling rifle and the sniper rifle are appealing, but the difficulty is extremely harsh, and the AI is pretty unforgiving. Even with patches to fix this, it still does put a damper on the gameplay as a whole.\n\nSo, I still do find myself really wanting to like this. It's a decently interesting package that does seem appealing, but suffers from some serious issues that drag it down hard. There are definitely other games out there more worth your money, but if it shows up in a good Humble Bundle or something, maybe give it a gander.","July 27, 2015","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It must have come in with some humble bundle or any other multi-title. I've been confusing this with Alpha Protocol all that time, so I didn't bother to install it. When I recently got Alpha Protocol with another bundle, I wondered what this second entry was, so I clicked "install".\n\nFirst of all, Alpha Prime is a classic story driven sci-fi PC shooter, so expect more or less linear gameplay with single room based exploration, some switch flipping, hilarious voice acting and a story you will probably laugh about in a coupe of years, when you look back at all the trash you've been watching, reading and playing before you got married. I have not been very far in the game, but far enough to know, what might expect me for the rest of the game.\n\nThe story:\nYou are a tough guy who knows a tough lady and you both go on a dangerous quest to save her boyfriend, so you venture to Godknowswhere on some distant planet. There is some sort of valuable mineral, that turns people into crazy idiots with guns and there are robots, not as crazy, but at least as well armed. That's pretty much all you need to know, if I lost you at this point, don't bother playing the game.\n\nGameplay and technology:\nThis game plays like most sci-fi shooters before the lack of buttons on console controllers found their entry to mainstream shooters. You can lean around the corner, a feature that was used by one half of all gamers and never even discovered by the other half. Bullets fly where you point your gun at. Instead of iron sights, you get a small zoom animation. Health does not regenerate. If you are on the planet surface outside the buildings, oxygen is rare, so you need to find refill stations. You can push around objetcs like crates, pick up items and throw them for damage. It's even encorporated in the few puzzles the game has to offer. You can shoot and destroy most glass surfaces. Imagine my surprise, when I tried to take cover in a room with a window, just to be gunned down by the guys outside. It lacks all the handholding of modern shooters. There is no "Press F to pick this up", maybe once on the first encounter, but after that you are on your own. The visuals are nothing to write home about. For a 2007 game, that didn't have a Crysis budget, the game looks solid and runs well enough. There are little to no glitches and the framerate is great on modern hardware.\n\nI will definitly try to finish this game and I'm glad I didn't miss it, even if I'm a little late to the party.","March 16, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even on Normal difficulty, the enemy AI has perfect aim and a single gatling shot can deal up to 15 points of damage. That's seven shots to death from full health! One shotgun pellet deals upwards of 35 damage, and the aforementioned perfect aim makes death in one or two hits inevitable.\n\nThe enemy humans do not need oxygen, so you can't wait them out and pick off the ones running for the oxygen pumps on the wall. (In one section, you're in a semi-protected tram car with an oxygen pump nearby.)\n\nYour eye level is not the height at which you can be shot, unlike most first-person shooters. Chest-high walls DO NOT protect against headshots while crouched.\n\nThe grenades do less splash damage than bunny farts, and the fiddly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s don't follow the same physics rules your body or other thrown objects do.\n\nI'd type more but Steam won't let me.

Now for the long version.\n\nThe story in this game is pretty much tossable. Something about people going insane for some key thing yet every enemy you meet is standard special ops big corporation whatever and some robots that decided to shoot anything moving.\n\nDialogue feels very forced from the poor writing and the fact it doesn't sound like anyone took a voice acting lesson. I kept cringing during some of the talk as they tried to cram way too much exposition.\n\nThe game took only four hours to finish and there was so little fun that it felt too long. It's extremely linear with a paltry variety of enemies.\n\nThe ending was terrible and made no sense after everything was "revealed." Weapons are pretty standard for any FPS (rocket launcher, flamethrower, machine gun, shotgun, etc) but there wasn't anything fun about using any of them. The sounds were lame and there was nothing that made you feel like you launched a rocket or shot somebody close range with the shotgun.\n\nEnemy designs are alright but the weapons and environment don't look so hot and sounds are weak (Nothing like barely seeing a guy around a corner and he just stands there yelling "Go go go!" with the idle animation of somebody who didn't detect you. Also experienced horrible screen tearing during the driving sequence (also not as fun as it sounds).

It is much more difficult than most FPS, you actually have to be tactical  so you don't die.  The voice acting is kind of silly, but reminds me of an action movie.  It is definitly a joy and am very glad I finallyh got a chance to beat it.","August 8, 2012","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

One thing is clear 6 bucks is clearly too expensive for that game. Let me explain:\n\nGood points:\n\nGameplay look great,\nShooting is Ok,\nObject moving and physics are good,\nThe story was bad but had a little ''who can you trust'' situation, wich was pretty confusing but interresting.\n\nBad parts: (Oh gosh)\n\nScripting and Writing were hillariously awfull,\nScenario was a pain in the ♥♥♥,\nThe A.I shooting was so trash it made me want to kill myself at some point,\nYou got to drive a car at some point...well...good luck with that,\n\nOverall this was a ok short game that deserve to be played, but don't buy it full price or you'll cry. Its the type of game that you bought in bundles and sit in your library and you wonder what it is.\n\nI dare you to try it. ( Or not)\n\n\n\n","April 23","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly the game has some annoying bugs especially regarding movement. Also the AI is unbalanced, their shots very rarely missing. On the harder difficulty the enemies have some super human reactions shooting you as the doors are opening in front of them.\n\nIn the end I recommend this game if you can get it really cheap and you have some time to kill.

For its age it looks fine, and the control feels ok.\nThe story is fairly crap though, so don't go into it expecting some Dan Abbnet level narrative.\n\nI played it offline for the most part, therefore my playtime is not reflected here (Rest assured, I have beaten it), and I don't plan on picking this up again any time soon.\n\nIf you just want to run around and shoot stuff in a world that does nothing to stand out, then give it a go.\nCan't recommend otherwise.","June 5","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
