Six years later, Vehicle Simulator has made its way on to Steam bringing all the original content as well as some free DLC packs which include some of the best mods which have been released for the game. Vehicle Simulator allows you to take control of aircraft, naval vehicles and cars in single player and multiplayer. I haven’t tried out the multiplayer and I’m not too sure how it actually works so this review is based entirely on the singleplayer portion of the game. It’s also worth mentioning that for aircraft I’ve played the game with a T-Flight HOTAS and for naval vehicles I used mouse & keyboard.\n\nFull disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.\n\nPresentation\nBeing a six year old game, Vehicle Simulator obviously isn’t the best looking game. If you’re used to playing older games such as FSX (though FSX does look better than VS in my opinion) then it shouldn’t be too much of an issue for you but if you’re a bit of a graphics nut you might not enjoy it so much. The base game vehicles are all great, looking about as good as they can, given the game’s age, however the vehicles included in the add-on packs are very hit and miss, some of them look just as good as the base game vehicles with other ones looking pretty rough. Obviously, how good the add-on vehicles look hasn’t really got anything to do with the devs but since you will want mods to expand the library of vehicles in the game I feel it’s worth mentioning.\n\nGameplay\nAs with most simulators of this sort the main appeal of the game, in my eyes at least, is the free flight (or the equivalent for boats/cars) but VS does feature scenarios for you to try out, you can even make your own! The scenarios are usually pretty simple, such as fly from point A to point B but some of them are far more interesting such as cargo runs or mid-air engagements. Free flight is self-explanatory, you just fly (or boat, is that a verb?) around any area you wish at your own pace for the simple purpose of exploration!\n\nVS has several different locations for you to explore, mainly in Southern Europe but there are a couple in the US and the Caribbean. Each location has its own scenarios, the number of scenarios depends on which location you’re looking at, with some having more than others. While the number of locations available in the base game with the free add-on packs isn’t particularly impressive (locations in particular, there are a reasonable amount of scenarios) there are plenty more to be downloaded from the VS add-on library website.\n\nOne of the really cool things about VS’ gameplay is that you can create and run scripts in the game, VS also includes three pre-made script scenarios and more are available as mods. If you know how to create them you really can do some cool things but the scenarios available are also pretty cool to watch, such as an F-86 taking down a little Cessna.\n\nRealism\nAs with all simulators, the realism is incredibly important and while I’m no expert, VS feels reasonably realistic. The aerodynamics seem to be pretty good and for the most part aircraft handling felt about right for the size and mass of the aircraft in question. Naval vehicles also seemed pretty realistic to me but I know a lot less about boats and submarines than I know about planes and helicopters. Sound effects also contribute to a game’s realism, sadly VS’ sound effects are pretty hit and miss, with more misses than hits. While some of the sound effects, mainly the engine sounds for base game vehicles, sounded reasonably realistic other sound effects weren’t so great and I often found myself wondering what the sound effect I was hearing was actually supposed to be. For a couple of aircraft I also felt that the variation of sound effects depending on where the chase camera was positioned was off though that may be dependent on the mod-makers rather than the game itself. In some cases the engine sounds would completely cut out unless the camera was positioned directly behind the aircraft which of course, is not very realistic.\n\nMiscellaneous In case I haven’t made it clear, there’s not a huge amount of base game content if you ignore the free DLC packs. While it has been out for six years so there are a fair few mods/free add-ons out there for you to use I would have expected there to be more base game content for the price tag. If you don’t mind using the slightly (and sometimes more than slightly) inferior community made mods this isn’t too much of an issue but if you do mind then VS might not be for you.\nThe game’s performance isn’t great even when running it on a PC well above the requirements. For most vehicles I was getting between 50 and 60FPS with reasonably regular, albeit short, drops to around 20FPS. For larger or more complex vehicles I was getting between 20 and 30FPS with some drops down to around 10FPS. Rendering the game in a window greatly increased my performance to sitting between 80 and 100FPS but again this was pretty unstable and I still experienced drops. As well as this I found that the game often had to pause for around a second on some of the maps to load scenery, now that’s not much time but when it’s happening every ten or fifteen seconds it becomes very noticeable and rather frustrating.\nWeapons in the game are fully-functional, they can be pretty fun to mess around with but they’re also used in some of the scenarios.\nYou can edit vehicles as well as create your own in-game, I haven’t messed around with this side of things too much since I’m not particularly good at that kind of thing but it’s rather interesting and in the right hands could be used to make some cool things.\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing on Sale.\n\nIf you can look past its dated graphics, VS is a solid simulator with enough free add-ons to keep you entertained for quite a while. While the non-sale price is a little steep for what the game offers I’d say it’s well worth purchasing at 25% off or more.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","December 13, 2015","true","4.8"," 55 of 61 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","55","61","2","5"

Included are 113 'toys' to play with and being an older game there is also many freely available mods to enjoy. Most seem high quality and would put 'certain other' sim franchises to shame.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CC5Z5Wl7TM\nWhile the game provided missions that ranged from sailing between targets to blasting missiles in the dead of night, effectively it's just a giant simulation sandbox. Each vehicle having 'newbie' or manual handling modes, examples being boats that automated heights of sails upon changing weather conditions and jetliners that would usually take a fortnight of studying manuals just take off the ground were able to be flown within minutes. Might sound like it's completely dumbed down and certain aspects are, still plenty to play with for avid sim enthusiasts.\n\nBoth performance and graphics were surprisingly good, no issues with load times or stutter. Scenery was sometimes spotty but far from terrible and I'm sure that it could be improved further with modding. Supports screen resolutions of 4k+ along with detailed controller remapping, personally I don't have some of the fancy gear available but most would probably function correctly. Vehicle Simulator is not just another fly by night, sim game using stock unity assets. Need to play more but it's impressed me thus far, easily recommended to the crowd it targets. Cheers.\n\nCopy was provided by developer, doesn't change my thoughts\nFeel free to ask questions, always reply as time permits.","December 9, 2015","true","3.6"," 70 of 108 people (65%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","65","70","108","10","17"

Which is a great deal more than I can say for ANY other simulator currently out or released in the last decade. Experienced Flight Simmers know what I mean here.\n\nThis is the most fun with a Flight Sim I've enjoyed since BEFORE microsoft ruined the flight sim genre by dumping barely functional FS titles on the market. Look no further than microsoft's bottomless pit of greed forcing Combat Flight Simulator 3 and FSX onto the world knowing that barely anything less than a Cray supercomputer could run them above 16 fps when they were new and semi-new!\nI and hundreds of  thousands of other PC pilots wish that we had the months of our lives handed back to us that we ALL wasted in vain attempts surfing the web to discover some fix to tweak better framerates out of those rehash-cashgrabs.\nCan I get a witness?!\n\nWell not this Sim brother, this one looks good and runs  S M O O T H !\nThis Sim does what it says AND MORE AAaaaannnd it's really FUN!\n\nIs it a fully dedicated  100% flight sim that is better than anything else ever created? No.\nIs it pretty close to that even though it doesn't brag that it is? YES!\nIs it better at flight simming than FS2004, FSX and Xplane?\nI honestly think so now and will answer that more confidently after the coming updates.\n\n> Vehicle Simulator is currently a better Flight Sim than 9 out of 10 titles in my opinion, and I played them all since the days of the Amiga 4K.\nCould it be better? Yes, and it is improving all the time now.\nIt may not have the entire globe like FSX but what it does have looks and runs wonderfully.\n\nPro's\n>Better at simulation than most other sims.\n>Small download, massive number of free DLC addons of very high quality.\n>Powerful physics that can be felt + High framerates maxed all settings with 50-75fps on midrange PC\n\n> Best described as crossing a physics based Flight & Sail Simulator with Gary's Mod <\n\n>Although a few crashes here and there due to my extreme and far fetched ideas in the sim I will call this a VERY stable simulator.\n> Love the music choices in game, especially sailing\n\nNotable features:\nLots of options. If you can fly, drive or sail it then it can be done in here, and done well.\n* The community can make and import even more content  > EASILY <\n* What a treat to have some little known music {french and Mexican] playing in the background as you watch the sun set and stars pop out while sailing, yachting or in your one man sub! = Mucho relaxing...\n\n>>>> DROP DEAD GORGEOUS WAVES AND OCEAN [viewed from below or above] BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SIM <<<<\n\n* The air combat is on par with titles I spent far more for, and those titles never delivered.\n* Impressive and fun cockpit POV, although hoping for more polished graphics and sound variety soon.\n* The creator is excited and active to pick up were he left off pre-Steam, so lots of upgrades and content coming.\n\nOne Example that impresses me:\nThe in-game stock F86 jet looks like it is made from highly polished metal, almost chrome. Strikingly beutiful to look at. By contrast this is how DCS World advertises their $Extra$ charge F86 but theirs looks only grey in reality because their DCS engine is 20+ years old and cannot render shiny bare metals!\n* So this Vehicle Simulator DOES IT BETTER THAN DCS currently does! * [Yes I own all DCS]\n\nSure the DCS cockpits are superior in graphical quality and function, but I see the Dev seriously upgrading cockpit detail, functionality and quality soon. Where DCS is maxed out being CPU greedy it looks to me that Vehicle Simulator is just getting started with lots of room to upgrade.☺ You cannot claim that from DCS or microsoft whose re-re-re-overhauled game engines stopped bearing fruit over a decade ago.\n\nCons:\n>Wished I would have discovered this sooner.\n>Powerful simulator but I need tutorials to help me wring the most out of things. I am still confused on many aspects and stumbling around trying to figure things out.\n** Interface is VERY user friendly however.\n>The graphics are very beautiful at times, but dated at others. I look forward to smoother hard-dark shadows in the cockpits, sharper reflections, and other more modern graphical eye-candy that has spoiled us in other titles.\n>Sounds are limited with one plane or car sounding like the next.\n> Unknown at this time how to set up dogfights, create new vehicles, change textures due to lack of hand holding tutorials\n>Have to start Steam to play. Like most I want to be able to play offline since we live in such a bandwidth depleted area\n\nMy hopes for the future are:\n\n* Be able to fly, sail or sub anywhere in the world\n* Updated and more modern graphics, textures, more realism rendering light and shadows and better explosions\n* Ability to set up player vs Ai opponents easier\n* More vehicles flooding the workshop <hint-hint>\n* More ocean life to sub around and sail by\n* More stock adventures, although there are more than most sims offer already\n* The ability to be an animal or fish or bird like in Gary's mod. [ this opens up the wonderful can of worms allowing the player to control [[create]] player animals like we create animatronic sharks for movies. ] Imagine getting to be a dinosaur, shark or whatever in this Sim, it'd be AWESOME!\n\nMy respect and honest thanks to the developer and his family. So glad you came to Steam so I could find you!\n","December 20, 2015","true","6.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

I downloaded all the DLC and started it, but Steam froze and i thought 'this is what is supposed to happen.'. I got tired of waiting for it to start right up and closed Steam because it was still frozen. After opening Steam again i tried to start the game again only to get a message saying the game was already running. Confused, i went into my task manager and found the processes running. I tried to close them but i couldn't without restarting my pc. I kept trying after receiving Developer support and i decided to get a refund.\n\n\nA few days after this, i reveived a message from a developer asking for help with getting the game working, and i accepted their generous key and downloaded the game. I started it up and to my suprise it worked right away, and after it worked i installed all the DLC, and they worked too.\n\n\nIm not sure how it happened, or if they released an update, but i love the game!\n\n\nThanks to the devs for being so nice and helping me even when they couldn't!\n\nI would totally recommend this to anybody who loves simulators!","December 15, 2015","true","1.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
