I completed everything and I mean everything (main story, small closing story, bonus game) in 5 hours. I took my sweet time and never used hints or skips. Most people will probably finish well under 5 hours.\n- Bonus game is not an addition to the story. Instead, they give you jigsaw puzzles of 3 of the backgrounds. But ONLY 3. I like the idea of HO story jigsaws but for $9.99, they should have had a much larger selection.\n- A few things seemed unpolished and for those who like cutscenes, you won't find them here.\n\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed playing this game but I feel like I didn't get my money's worth.","October 5, 2014","true","11.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

The only good thing I can say about it is that the graphics were pretty good.  But, the decent graphics couldn't hide the fact that everything else about the game was garbage.\n\nThis game lacked everything new and challenging that other point and click games have.  The "story" was miserable.  Now, most point and click games have ridiculous stories and I appreciate them for being outrageous because they believe in themselves.  The problem with The Curse of the Werewolves was that it had NO story when, given the subject matter, it could have had a really good one.  Werewolves are scary and exciting, right?  Not when its just granny wolfing out and accidently killing the neighbors.  The End.\n\nThe game was unacceptably short, even for a point and click.  I played through it in about 2 hours.  For a $10 game, I find that to be almost criminal.\n","October 13, 2014","false","2.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

A bit simple. The plot is a bit weak, the puzzles pretty easy. The ending a bit disappointing. I completed it in 2h.  So, maybe not worth 9,99$.

The game seems like a mix of point and click adventure with mixed in hidden object scenes and mini games. Also there is a bonus section, where you can try and battle some jigsaw puzzles of images from the game.\nWell, I was hooked right away, so I decided to make a let's play out of the game :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=313975944\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=314621239\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=315373231\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=315373228\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=315373227\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=315373226","September 14, 2014","true","3.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
