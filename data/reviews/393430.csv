As an ice fisherman myself, I can say that it is exactly what it says it is... Ice Fishing. I think the graphics are OK for what it is, the gameplay is good, and I'm enjoying my time with it so far.\n\nOne downside is that there is no tutorial (at least that I noticed). Meaning, if you don't know ice fishing already, you could be lost. Some simple instructions would go a long way.\n\nA couple of tips for starters: You need to run out on the lake, pick a spot, drill a hole with your auger, BAIT your hook/jig (there are grubbs that go on the hook or you won't catch anything). You can vary your depth using your mouse wheel (where I live, slightly off the bottom is where you fish, but other depths can work). There is a strainer next to the hole to keep ice out of the hole (click on it, I think I caught more fish when the hole was clear). Watch the end of the pole, when you get a hit, hit the F button on your keyboard or use the reel icon on the screen to pull up the line. Lastly, there is a bait shop near where you started for bait, etc. and when the time is running down, get back to that area to have your score count! Not exactly "review" material, but I hope this is some help to you.\n\nAll in all, a good ice fishing game that I'd recommend to a friend. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet...","April 19","true","3.8"," 65 of 75 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","65","75","0","0"

Ice fishing is not fast paced or about the fights, its about the right lure in the right location.\nGraphics could be better but honestly they are better then alot of other $12 games out there. Animation motions are smooth and did not experience any clipping issues.\nMulti-player is a fun idea, seeing others running around digging holes and jumping spot to spot on the ice.\nThe sounds in the game are accurate and good.\nDid not seem to be drawing anything from my second video card but the game ran very smooth with no crashes or hang-ups.\nI would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fishing, we dont have enough fishing games out there to pick from and to the collectors of group multiplayer games.","April 19","true","0.4"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","36","45","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/juhnu85/recommended/393430/","juhnu85","juhnu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/juhnu85/","377 products in account","Is it the most realistic ice fishing game? Definitely not. Is it fun? Absolutely! Especially when played with friends over voice chat.\n\nThe devs have assuredly played Pro Pilkki before, since there are quite a lot of similarities in the game mechanics and that is not a bad thing. For years Pro Pilkki has been the best ice fishing game out there and it's really a time for it to have some competition. Does Ice Lakes provide the competition? I'd like to think so. It has it's ups and downs but over time this game could take the spot as #1 ice fishing game, assuming the devs will provide updates and fixes to it.\n\nIce Lakes is still fresh out of the oven and that can be seen, especially on the multiplayer front. Hosting a game / being able to join a friends game can be quite a pain in the buttocks. Setting a password or lowering the max players value don't seem to have an affect. But once you get going, it's really fun and I'm  optimistic that these small problems will be fixed in coming updates.\n\nIf you are expecting realism, then you might be a bit disappointed. The fish weights and amount of fish you are able to catch can seem quite absurd at times. 1.2kg ruffe.. that's something I'd like to see IRL ;) If you are up for some arcade ice fishing, then this game is definitely something to try out!\n\n5/5, will recommend!","April 21","true","14.9"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/393430/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2518 products in account","NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Ice Lakes is a single- and multi-player ice fishing game.\n\nIt includes ten different maps and a number of different game types, but really they all boil down to catching the most fish of certain types within the time limit.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - Graphics are pretty good, with convincing snow-covered scenery and frozen lakes, and some nice additional touches like rabbits and foxes, cabins, rowboats moored on the frozen shores, etc, to maintain the atmosphere. Player character models aren't great when zoomed in up close (such as when selecting your character), but when playing they look okay, and are animated quite well.\n\nThere's a reasonable list of graphics options in case you're playing on an under-powered PC. I played in full HD with everything turned on on a four-year-old gaming laptop, and didn't encounter any performance problems, even after alt-tabbing a number of times.\n\nSound - Sounds are very simple, but appropriate enough. I found myself playing with some ambient electronic music of my own in the background to fill in the silence, but that's just me.\n\nGameplay - Ice Lakes is all about ice fishing, so the gameplay involves drilling holes in the ice, baiting your hook, lowering it through the hole into the water below, and wiggling it around until you catch a fish. There's no tutorial or guide included in the game, but after a couple of minutes of experimentation I had the basics down pat, and from there it was just trial and error to try to work out where and how to catch the most and largest fish.\n\nThe game includes 10 different maps, and you're able to select from a number of different goals or game types for each map, including a 'free play' option. I used the free play option to learn the basics, but really there's no reason you can't do that after jumping straight into one of the other game types instead.\n\nThe other game types involve you competing against a group of other ice fisherman for the specified time, with the winner being the one who catches the most of the specified types and returns to the starting area within the allowed time. I don't know enough about ice fishing in general, or the advanced tactics of Ice Lakes itself, to know if the other computer-controlled characters are acting intelligently, but they're fun to watch and the competition is a welcome addition over free mode. Online multiplayer is an option that I've not yet tried. I believe it plays exactly the same as the single player game, but with your competitors controlled by real people.  Pre-set tournaments are also included and involve playing consecutive competitive levels one after another.\n\nAs well as the map assortment, the game keeps you busy with the included achievements, many different types of fish, and a whole host of fishing gear to buy with the cash earned from selling your fish at the market in the starting area.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Pretty good graphics overall, with interesting environments that look quite pretty\n+ Attention to detail is good, with a number of little touches for good effect\n+ Enthusiastic and responsive developers on the Steam forums for the game\n+ Achievements, to give you something more to aim for\n+ Trading cards\n\nCons:\n- It can get a bit boring; some random events, such as cracks in the ice, have been suggested in the forums, and would be a welcome addition\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================I've never been ice fishing in my life, and the topic doesn't interest me that much. That said, however, I found Ice Lakes a fairly relaxing and moderately enjoyable game to play.\n\nIt's a game for a niche market, but I believe it fills that niche well, and leaves me with really nothing to complain about. I'd recommend it for anyone into ice fishing, or anyone interested in playing something a bit different.\n\n7/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","May 13","true","3.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","10","12","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timmpalainen/recommended/393430/","timmpalainen","T¡m","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timmpalainen/","1242 products in account","I remember the days when I was out there myself - the long days in the cold, cold African glaciers, wearing nothing but a pair of Adidas Air Jordan Hiking Boots™ and a tank top sewn by my late grand mother. I would sit there for hours, completely still, waiting for my prey. I remember it like it was yesterday - I caught the Eel out of the corner of my eye as it sat there, under the ice - taunting me. But was I affected? No. I was as still as ever; waiting for the right moment. The Eel, that I had lovely named "Eel", obviously thought I had frozen to death as he started moving towards my perfectly placed ice fishing hole. I watched him get closer and closer, still staying completely unmoving. Eel crept along carefully and as soon as I saw the little trickster's nose - that was it. I lunged forward, using all of my preserved strength - I dove into the water and grappled the eel around it's neck immidietly strangling him.\n\nI thought that was the end - but oh, was I wrong. Only hours after the strangling took place, me still holding fast around the eel's neck, to make sure it was completely strangled and also dead - his friends came. A hugh murder of eels (a group of eels is called a 'murder', I know because I am the king of eel fishing and sorts) came out of the dark, dark waters and attacked me. It only took seconds for them to knock me unconscious and bring me back to their lair. They kept me there for six and and half years.\n\nWhen I finally managed to escape their inprisonment, through the help of a fantasticly helpful man, who said his name was 'Captain Bingo', the first thing I did was to log onto my Steam account and look for a new cool game. The first game I saw was "Barbie & The Revenge of the Clubhouse" but I had already played it. The next one was this one; "ICE LAKES" and I immedietly got massive PTSD of the time when I got caught by a viscious group of eels. (Want to read that story? I have a book coming out soon).\n\nI soon recovered though, bought and installed the game and I can honestly say, as I person who obviously knows his way around a fishing pole and/or rod that this game is quite realistic. There is snow, which is usually a sight that you see while you go ice fishing (which is not actually an activity where you fish ice, but you actually fish for regular fish just in an icy environment). There are also several types of fishes and even a type of eel. I'd have liked too see all the different types of eels, because there are definately a few of them - almost five to be more exact, they are; The Siberian Swanktail, The British Eelfish, The French Fisheel-eel, The Pan-American destructive dongus and the wildly disputed West Canadian Winterveil which some delusioned people actually think is a form of undersea Golden Retriever variant.\n\nOtherwise, the game is solid. There are quite a few friendly Finnish people on it - they might be a bit shy and reserved, but as soon as you get them on your side, they'll be your friend for life.\n\nThat's cool.","April 23","true","1.5"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","67","18","27","17","0"

You can finally go ice fishing in 3D. Ice Lakes keeps the focus in fishing and there is more customization than in the previous ice fishing games I have played: you can change different hooks to your jigs or you can drop some baits in the water to lure a specific fish a bit better. Meanwhile you can scoop off the ice from your fishing hole. These little things really improve the atmosphere. You can upgrade your gear in the shop after you have earned some money from the games.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the developers in Ice Flake Studios are listening the community and applying hotfixes fast. The biggest problem I found was that fishes' weight was too high, but a hotfix for this was applied on the next day. There is still some tuning in fishes' weight but it is already ALOT better.\n\nI actually sent the developers an e-mail where I asked about future plans and I listed some suggestions that I personally hoped to see in the game. On the next day I got an answer from one of the developers where he took the time to separately answer all of my questions. For example online stats are in the to do -list, as well as adding information of current lake's species so you can see them while fishing. I also said that at the moment it is too easy to reel in bigger fishes and developer answered that they are currently working to improve this, and this should be one of the first improvements they are applying.\n\nAll in all I would recommend this game for everyone who likes fishing or fishing games in general. Lets face it, there really is not enough fishing games so Ice Lakes is a very welcome addition.\n\nLastly some tips I suggest:\n\n- I am fishing holding down "Mouse 1", moving the mouse trying to lure the fish. You can reel in the fish pressing "F" or moving the mouse to the top of your screen and releasing "Mouse 1". I changed the "F" key to "Space" so it is possible to just hit the keyboard to reel in your catch.\n\n- If you want to hunt for the biggest fish or you prefer the ocean maps, I suggest you save your money for the heaviest equipment to be able to catch them.\n\n- I changed to third person and preferred that immediatly. Using "WASD" to move is the most convenient.\n\n- If you can not catch any fish, try scrolling your mouse to try from a different depth.","April 22","true","9.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
