"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/246960/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is without a doubt one of the best things to come out of the great retro platformer deluge, which began somewhere around the release of Super Meat Boy. It was stunning to look at, a joy to play, and managed to feel fresh yet familiar at the same time. As with any good thing fans are bound to want more, and Black Forest Games has now delivered just that with Rise of the Owlverlord; a standalone expansion that in many ways is even better than the game which spawned it!\n\nIf you've played Twisted Dreams (and you definitely should have before jumping into Owlverlord), you should know what you're getting into here; a tightly knit platformer with a neat world shifting mechanic, that controls like a charm and features an outstanding soundtrack. Owlverlord doesn't mess with this formula at all, but reworks it into a smaller more focused experience that fixes nearly all of my complaints of the original and then some.\n\nWhile I enjoyed Twisted Dreams a lot, variety was not its strong suit and I quickly found myself fatigued of it after only a few level, forcing me to space it out of many short sessions to keep it from completely wearing out its welcome. I never felt this with Owlverlord. While there are far fewer levels this time (7, if you include the boss fight at the end), the upside of this is that each is longer and more uniquely designed than those found in the original game, with some of, if not the best level designs the series has seen to date! It took me weeks to finish the original game, but I tore through Owlverlord like a starving dog who just found a box of bacon, and was left eager for more (despite previously thinking I had had more than my fill of the series after the first game).\n\nIf you enjoyed Twisted Dreams there is absolutely no reason you should hesitate to pick up Rise of the Owlverlord! It's a shorter game, but a better one in every regard (which is saying something as the original was fantastic as well) that heightens the challenge, fine tunes the gameplay, and somehow manages to deliver and even more ridiculously awesome soundtrack than last time (Machinae Supremacy has completely outdone themselves yet again)! If you have yet to play Twisted Dreams you are missing out on one the best modern platformers we have, a fact Owlverlord only further solidifies. Black Forest Games have continued to impress me more than I would have expected from such humble Kickstarter beginnings, and now have me wishfully hoping a true Giana Sisters 2 is on the horizon.\n\nDon't delay, there's an Owlverlord to topple!\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","February 23, 2014","true","2.5"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","41","48","0","0"

Completing hard difficulty took me around 3-4 hours the first time playing, so the game is fairly short if you don't give all the other game modes a try (took me around 15~ hours to complete the game 100%)\n\nThe controls are solid for this game, I didn't mess up once because of bad controls or anything like that, Giana moved where I wanted her to, worth noting that I used an Xbox 360 controller to play through the game, can't say how the keyboard controls are as I didn't try them.\n\nNow the soundtrack for this game, and the base game is fantastic. The Cute / Punk version of every song blends together perfectly when you switch between the two different versions of Giana.\n\nThis is NOT an easy game, you're gonna have to restart over and over again, be prepared.","September 29, 2013","true","15.2"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","41","49","2","4"

The game forces the player to shift between "cute" and "punk" Giana constantly in order to make progress or survive traps even more than the original game. Traps are always there making the player balance out cleverness and reflexes, and enemies are strategically put most of times to aid reaching a secret area or merely to pose an extra challenge.\n\nTwisting Dreams againSwapping between cute and punk Giana is a must here and the game will never let you forget about this even once. Swapping can be done between a specific key assigned to it or by using the Fireball Roll (which automatically swaps to punk Giana) or twirling (which swaps to cute Giana). At first it may seem simple, but the game will have creative ways to spice up things as levels goes by.\n\nRunning and jumping is very precise as you'd expect (and want) in a platformer, the controls feels great and runs smoothly at all times.\n\nLearning curve: STEEPUnlike the core game Rise of the Owlverlord holds no punches and throws everything it can as soon you decide to play. Mercifully there is a "Normal" mode which considerably ramps down the difficulty inserting safe places between death traps and removing certain gimmicks that would require split second reaction to bypass.\n\nHowever as soon you decide to pick "Hard" mode you're in for a rough ride as the game will not hold your hand even for the first second of the first level, but playing at hard difficulty will allow you to earn rank stars and will unlock the finished level for Time Attack and Score Attack mode.\n\nNot enough yet?For those seeking for more challenge the game still have the Hardcore difficulty (which removes every checkpoint) and the Über Hardcore (which gives you one, single life for the entire game).\n\nFinal considerationsRise of the Owlverlord follows just as well the core game and is more than a "more of the same" expansion, it is a fine platformer with beautiful graphics, amazing controls and brutally difficult if you are not used to platformers.","November 28, 2013","true","11.1"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

A single player experience at its core that gives you the ability to shift between 2 dimensions.\n\nThe thing that makes this game unique is that you control one of the twins at a time but can switch between the two at any given time and when you do switch, you remain in that same exact space but the level around you is what changes to illustrate shifting between dimensions. As you do this, certain objects you need may appear or paths may be open but with that enemies may become worse or the level may become more dangerous as well.\n\nThere are different difficulties for the game. The harder difficulty is quite the difference from the other difficulties as it totally revamps the levels in order to test your skills. This is a colorful and cheerful game with cute style and a decent soundtrack as well. Not bad for a quick game.\n\nIt's a great game for both kids and adults to play, the difficulties allow for all players to play the game and asjust the game according to their specific needs or playstyle. This game will be nice for anyone who favors the original Mario and Sonic games.\n\nPros  Switch between 2 worlds at any time\nSoundtrack instantly changes to coincide with your switching between worlds\nGame changes according to your difficulty\nFull controller support\nCons  Short game isn't enough bang for the buck\nNo reason to go back to play once you finish\nNo unlockables\nFinal Thoughts:\nIt's got alot of heart for such a small package. The levels are short just like the games length. With spirit and color the game excels but there are alot if other options on the market that overshadow this.\n\nRating (6.7 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","January 12","true","3.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

There are 10 levels, but they're much longer than before. The music's new, so there's no rehashing there.\n\nThere's really not much to say that I didn't already say in my review of the first title. It's a comptetent indie platformer that doesn't do what others do and go for the 'retro' 8-bit look which is getting aggrivating.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bovinoid/recommended/246960/","Bovinoid","Bovinoid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bovinoid/","82 products in account","Hi People,\n\nGiana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is not the typical horizontal scrolling platform game with one button to move the character and another to jump. If you have played the ancestors, The Grat Giana Sisters and Giana Sisters DS you know I'm trying to tell you.\n\nIn this game you have the possibility to manipulate your dreams and transform the character when you want to be able to jump, glide, kill the enemies, etc. You can transform Giana in any moment and choose the prudent/demure Giana or the aggressive Giana depending the situation. It's important to emphasise that you can transform Giana ALWAYS you want over and over again. When you play with the "cute/shy/prudent" Giana you can only kill the enemies jumping over them like the typical platform. But, when you play with the "aggressive" Giana you can kill the enemies jumping over them or by means of the special attack consisting in transform Giana in a fire ball more or less like Sonic when rolls.\n\nMoreover, another important thing is the stage of the game. Why? Because the stage have a little changes depending on the tranformation of Giana you have in this moment. For example, If you have the "Cute" Giana you will have in front of you a solid wall impossible to cross, but if you tranform the character and you play with the "aggressive" Giana this solid wall disappear allowing you to cross because you are playing in two different dreams (I think it is like a big puzzle).\n\nTo sum up:\n\nPros:\n-Original platform game\n-Excellent Stages (1080p 60Hz)\n-Frenetic game in lots of situations with fast scenes.\n-Excellent controls with Microsoft 360 pad.\n\nContras:\n-Boring game depends on the level and could be repetitive.\n-Easy. I want to enable the difficult level and I hope it will be better.\n-You don't have "lifes" and you can die as many times as you want to.\n\nIn conclusion, YES i would recommend it to anyone!\n\nBye!\nBovinoid","January 4, 2014","true","2.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You play as Giana, who has the worst case of split personality I've ever seen, who has been recently captured by the Owls and thier King/Lord/Thingy and now you have to deal with them before they complete their vaguely referenced plan of dominance over the world.\n\nAs I said before, Giana has a bit of a split persoanlity problem that she uses to her advantage. While as Punk Rocker Giana, you have a power fire dash that, in some ways, can work alot like a Homing Attack from Sonic the Hedgehog. You can execute several of these dashes as long as you've hit an enemey. For every one enemy hit like this, you can dash again, great for traversing large areas quickly. You can also use the fire dash to break through cracked walls as well.\n\nAs Goth Giana, you gain a spin-jump that you can use to go higher than before and ride wind currents. You can also use the Spin-Jump to trigger mechanism.\n\nChanging between the two personalities change how the world is percieved. Mechanisms, platforms, enemies, and even some attacks change when you switch between the two forms. Knowing which form to use is up to you.\n\nThe music is great, though it is quite short, only seven levels, though each level themselves are quite massive and puzzling.\n\nI give this game a 4 out of 5, and a must have for those who like action-platforming in the same vein as Donkey Kong Country.","March 5, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But I want to point out that this game is crippled by the checkpoints not being saved when you exit the game. I spent a significant amount of time getting the first 4 keys on stage 2 and then got stuck on my way to get the last one. I spend quite a bit of time on it, and then it started getting late and I just wanted to switch it off and try again from the checkpoint some other time, but I knew after making that mistake previously that it doesn't save the checkpoints...so I kept on playing.\n\nAnyway, I ended up turning it off, and it's going to be hard to bring myself to go to all the trouble I already went through knowing that there's a bit I struggle with coming up. I'm sure I'll have another crack at it some time...\n\nIt's not the 90's anymore. I mean, it's cool to have the uber hardcore mode for people who want the bragging rights, but if you're gonna put checkpoints in the game, make it so they save when you turn the game off.\n\nEven if I never play it again, it was worth the 94c just to enjoy the gameplay for a couple of hours, hence why I recommend it. If the checkpoints saved, I'd say it was probably well and truly worth the full $5 (assuming the rest of the game is as good as the first couple of levels).\n\nEDIT: (I had another crack at level 2 after a good night's sleep and managed to get through it pretty quickly. It's a really outstanding game, but I still find the fact that it doesn't save the checkpoints both frustrating and a baffling design choice.)\n\nEDIT2: After a few playthroughs it becomes easy to finish every level. Getting stars is more difficult, but once you've familiarised yourself with each level, it's easy to estimate how long it will take to play the level and decide if you have time to play. The play times are reasonably short, so even with a busy lifestyle it's no problem to set aside a few minutes to have a crack at getting more stars on a level. My only advice is to make sure you set aside plenty of time to finish the levels the first time you play them. The game is awesomely addictive, controls are smooth and responsive, and despite the somewhat complex mechanics for a platformer, it's very intuitive. The visuals are stunning, and the soundtrack is nice.\n\ntl;dr: great game but the fact that checkpoints are lost when the game is closed is frustrating when you're first learning the levels.","May 16, 2014","true","17.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The boss is also way way better than anything in the original and actually fun and all that, so props on that. I can't say it's that bad level-design wise though there's still some stupid things like no spare hits in stage 2 and lots of moments where you're expected to predict the future (especially in regards to what path to go). The difficulty is pretty even throughout, about the same as the third world of the original game.

Around 6 levels, and a boss fight against the Owlverlord. If you beat Giana Sisters awhile ago, think it's worth replaying, then check out the new content. If you haven't played Giana Sisters before, you COULD use this as a demo... but the full game has about 3-4x the content and goes on sale for the same price as this standalone","October 3, 2013","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I should've done the tutorial first.  Still, when you get past the lag and the quirky controls, it kinda grows on you quite well.\n\nFor those not "in the know", Giana Sisters was once a Mario spoof on the Commodore 64 and the Amiga (it was called "The Great Giana Sisters").  But who knew there was enough of a following that there'd be a new game with a new flavor all its own?  Again, when you get past the weird controls and (if you foolishly loaded it on a laptop, like I have) the lag, you might actually find it really fun.  And hey, you can't beat the price!","March 6, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mix in it the preemptive pastiche of the magical ambiance of Rayman forests, even some of the high speed thrills of Sonic the Hedgehog. What more could one ask?\n\nWell, the truth is that platformers to me need to have a quintessential feature: Tight control  scheme. It's a make or break thing. And unfortunately, Giana Sisters is the latter. I tried both gamepad and keyboard defaults and the movement always feels very unprecise. In fact, I've never been so frustrated with a side-scroller controls and I've been a keen fan of them since the 1990s (I played the lot, Super Mario Bros., Alex Kidd, Sonic, Rayman, Kirby, Donkey Kong Country, Crash Bandicoot... you name it.) None feels as broken as this. So it's a no go, if you want my opinion.","February 28, 2015","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dragon stole Maria, and Giana decided to save her sister. Simple and clear)\nIn the game you play as a one sister - Giana, but with two personalities, and it`s cool, I think ;)\nAs well really liked game world, especially the fact that it changes. Very surprised that at any time, you can switch between the two personas (cute Giana and punk Giana) to make use of their abilities, which in turn will also switch the dream layout accordingly. When you play as a cute Giana you play in the world of nightmares, but when you play as punk Giana you see dream world, and it makes the game really unusual and interesting!\n\nIn conclusion, I can say that you need to play in Giana Sisters if you want something unusual, beautiful and just have a good time!))","January 11, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels like the experience of the first game has been distilled and refocused, leaving what is a very enjoyable expansion.  Granted the level of precision needed in platforming to beat each level has been reduced, but overall I had a funner time playing this game although I had a good time with the first as well.  I guess in that sense, the style for each game is different then as the first focused more on platforming and the expansion more on speed.  At times it even reminded me of Sonic because of the pacing.  The mechanics are same as the first one and there are much fewer levels, so it's quite easy to blast through the stages and into the boss, but overall it's really fun.  As a note, it's not necessary to play through the first game in order to understand this one as the stories are independent of each other.  I hope the developers continue to explore the world of Giana Sisters.","November 30, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
