(the list goes on). I was a apprehensive with purchasing this as I feared the game may have been too childish, but this is not the case.\n\nThe puzzles definitely get fairly complex. I've only played up to the third world so far, and nothing has been all that challenging, but if the pace continues, the fourth world is going to have some wonderfully difficult challenges. Don't expect something to twist your mind like a puzzle from Braid or FEZ might. The puzzles here rely on the teamwork mechanic. You must control up to four different characters, switching between them, one at a time, and orchestrate their movements in order to progress.\n\nThe RPG-esque elements add fun content to the game (which could stand on its own without them). There are always sidequests to complete and new ones pop-up frequently, at least once you complete a world. The secrets aren't that well hidden, which is a little frustrating, but some have been tricky enough to make up for it.\n\nThe game definitely has a unique charm. The monsters all have quite different personalities and add a nice flavor to the game. The humor just makes me smile.\n\nDon't go into this game expecting be lost on a puzzle for hours, as none of them are THAT difficult. They will make you think in a different way than you're used to, which is what puzzle games really should do, in my opinion.\n\n9/10","November 27, 2014","true","8.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Literally.\nThe colors are bright and the shapes are appealing. I can understand why Cartoon Network picked this project up later on.\nAs I was using an xbox controller, the controls are obviously different. But it requires little to no effort to do anything in this game. All you need is the left thumbstick, the 'A' button, and your 'LB'/'RB' buttons.\nThe dialogue is cute and light with adorable humor. I'll forever use 'broccoli farts' as an endearing way to say 'gas'.\nAnd of course, the music is light hearted and pleasant.\n\nNow on to the actual game play!\nAs I pointed out earlier, all you're doing is using your thumbstick to move , the 'A' button to use an action, and your 'LB'/'RB' buttons to change your character when you're in play.\nThere are various little obstacles you need to overcome to help clear your way to collect cake pieces. (And some other goodies such as gold coins and keys)\nAs this is a casual puzzle game, you don't actually die unless you step onto a trap or the boogies get you.\nThe only limiter you sort of have is the timer. But you only really care about that if you want your 3 star ranking.\nThe first two puzzles are extremely easy as they are there to introduce the game mechanics.\nMoving forward, you end up meeting monster friends one by one and they help you solve the various levels so that you can advance.\n\nSo far, this is an absolutely adorable, fun game for all ages.\nThe only slightly annoying thing I encountered, and I don't know if it was just me, but the music volume would sort of go up and down in the beginning. But after a while it will go back to being consistant.\nI'm glad I donated for this project and I wish the guys at SleepingNinja much success.\nThanks for such a wonderful and polished game!","July 1, 2014","true","5.7"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","25","39","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunonymous/recommended/297590/","sunonymous","Sunonymous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunonymous/","224 products in account","Monsters Started to Eat My Birthday Cake\nI discovered this game because Disasterpeace composed the soundtrack and I adore Disasterpeace. Anything he works on I look into. I added this game to wishlist and waited for a sale... I can't remember if I bought it on sale or got impatient and purchased regardless, but after playing through it I think it is worth the price they ask!\n\nThis game follows the adventures of Niko, a young boy whose particular birthday becomes the second worst birthday ever, thanks to the Monsters that--you guessed it--Ate [His] Birthday Cake, although I feel like that's not entirely true, as the premise of the game has you trekking across worlds acquiring discarded slices of the cake itself. Admittedly though, "Monsters Took My Birthday Cake and Strew it Across the Island for Little Apparent Reason" doesn't quite have a ring to it...\n\nAlong the journey, Niko makes friends with a cast of eclectic and quirky characters, each of which has a special ability that helps the player to solve puzzles and progress through the levels. The levels are accessible through a "road-map" with each stage being a separate bump in the road (think Super Mario Brothers 3). Even the cutscenes are replayable by entering their "stage".\nEach level contains multiple objectives which reward you with a star for each mission completed. This means that there is incentive to replay levels and beat the target time, or find the hidden treasures, etc. The treasures can be traded and compiled with the townsfolk to complete side quests and unlock costumes for Niko. These costumes are vital, as some costumes give Niko new abilities  that allow access into parts of the levels that are otherwise unreachable.\n\nAll in all, this is a very enjoyable game! It challenges your mind and coordination without being unreasonable, and provides a lot of laughs. The humor can be a bit childish sometimes, but it's the youthful demeanor that makes this game what it is. I have played it on Android and on PC, and I prefer PC. Touch controls just never appealed to me as much as the precision of a keyboard.\n\nAnd then I bought the soundtrack.[music.disasterpeace.com]","September 9, 2015","true","10.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Eh...\n\nTruth be told, I'm not sure how epic the story gets because I am still crawling through the first world. The gameplay is clever, but it feels a bit mechanical. You'll have to replay a tricky level to get the timing right, to find the simple solutions that tend to hide in plain sight. If you want all the in-game achievements, you're replaying some of these levels a few times each. The world feels small, because it's a series of short levels to puzzle through in 2 minutes or less. After a few mini-levels in a row, you'll gain a small tidbit of story to move forward with.\n\nThis game seems to hinge on whether you enjoy the gameplay or not. I'm not a huge fan of it. I prefer my puzzlers to be a bit faster, spontaneous and unpredictable. There's not a lot of surprise here. You either make the right turns or you don't. If you do, awesome, time for the next similar level. If you don't, try again. Rinse, repeat.\n\nThe design is clever, and the characters are cute. But they feel a bit flat, with minimal dialogue and few defining characteristics. The story seems to unravel a bit slowly (what little story there is). I give them credit for including a story, but I'd love more of it. There is good humor in this title, but other reviewers seem to find it funnier than I did. (Some of the characters communicate with emoticons, to give you an idea.)\n\nI've picked this one up multiple times to try and get engaged, but no dice. By no means is it a bad game, or a waste of money. I'm just a bit disinterested so I feel like I could've spent the few dollars on a more addictive puzzler. YMMV.\n\nPS: Get it on sale.","November 2, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"

It was a nice, short but sweet puzzle game that was super fun and amusing. The game is a bit on the shorter side, myself having completed it 100% in about 12 hours. Though there were harder puzzles near the end, the game's difficulty is not extremely high, leaning more on the casual side. This would be a perfect game for someone who doesn't play puzzle games that much, or for a younger audience. Those are the demographics this game would be best suited for. Though with the visual style and cute little story attached, any puzzle game fan could play this and enjoy it for what it's worth. The game's puzzles were intuitive and fun, making up the majority of the gameplay. There was a mild bit of fetch-questy type quests thrown in here and there as well. I'm aware some people do not care for fetch quests, but I believe they were executed well in this game. The music and atmosphere was very well suited to the game. The songs were not repetitive or annoying but well fitting to the environments, which were also finely crafted.

It's hard to put my finger on what it is that is attractive and addictive about this game, but I would highly recommend it as something to play when you're having a hard day, and just need some attention-grabbing and fun distraction.","January 15","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
